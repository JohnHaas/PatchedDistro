Interbank lending market

The interbank lending market is a market in which banks extend loans to one another for a specified term. Most interbank loans are for maturities of one week or less, the majority being overnight. Such loans are made at the interbank rate (also called the overnight rate if the term of the loan is overnight). Low transaction volume in this market was a major contributing factor to the financial crisis of 2007.
Banks are required to hold an adequate amount of liquid assets, such as cash, to manage any potential bank runs by clients. If a bank cannot meet these liquidity requirements, it will need to borrow money in the interbank market to cover the shortfall. Some banks, on the other hand, have excess liquid assets above and beyond the liquidity requirements. These banks will lend money in the interbank market, receiving interest on the assets.
The interbank rate is the rate of interest charged on short-term loans between banks. Banks borrow and lend money in the interbank lending market in order to manage liquidity and satisfy regulations such as reserve requirements. The interest rate charged depends on the availability of money in the market, on prevailing rates and on the specific terms of the contract, such as term length. There is a wide range of published interbank rates, including the federal funds rate (USA), the LIBOR (UK) and the Euribor (Eurozone).
Interbank segment of the money market.
The interbank lending market refers to the subset of bank-to-bank transactions that take place in the money market.
The money market is a subsection of the financial market in which funds are lent and borrowed for periods of one year or less. Funds are transferred through the purchase and sale of money market instruments—highly liquid short-term debt securities. These instruments are considered cash equivalents since they can be sold in the market easily and at low cost. They are commonly issued in units of at least one million and tend to have maturities of three months or less. Since active secondary markets exist for almost all money market instruments, investors can sell their holdings prior to maturity. The money market is an over-the-counter (OTC) market.
Banks are key players in several segments of the money market. To meet reserve requirements and manage day-to-day liquidity needs, banks buy and sell short-term uncollateralized loans in the federal funds market. For longer maturity loans, banks can tap the Eurodollar market. Eurodollars are dollar-denominated deposit liabilities of banks located outside the United States (or of International Banking Facilities in the United States). US banks can raise funds in the Eurodollar market through their overseas branches and subsidiaries. A second option is to issue large negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs). These are certificates issued by banks which state that a specified amount of money has been deposited for a period of time and will be redeemed with interest at maturity. Repurchase agreements (repos) are yet another source of funding. Repos and reverse repos are transactions in which a borrower agrees to sell securities to a lender and then to repurchase the same or similar securities after a specified time, at a given price, and including interest at an agreed-upon rate. Repos are collateralized or secured loans in contrast to federal funds loans which are unsecured.
Role of interbank lending in the financial system.
To support the fractional reserve banking model.
The creation of credit and transfer of the created funds to another bank, creates the need for the 'net-lender' bank to borrow to cover short term withdrawal (by depositors) requirements. This results from the fact that the initially created funds have been transferred to another bank. If there was (conceptually) only one commercial bank then all the new credit (money) created would be redeposited in that bank (or held as physical cash outside it) and the requirement for interbank lending for this purpose would reduce. (In a fractional reserve banking model it would still be required to address the issue of a 'run' on the bank concerned).
A source of funds for banks.
Interbank loans are important for a well-functioning and efficient banking system. Since banks are subject to regulations such as reserve requirements, they may face liquidity shortages at the end of the day. The interbank market allows banks to smooth through such temporary liquidity shortages and reduce 'funding liquidity risk'.
Funding liquidity risk.
Funding liquidity risk captures the inability of a financial intermediary to service its liabilities as they fall due. This type of risk is particularly relevant for banks since their business model involves funding long-term loans through short-term deposits and other liabilities. The healthy functioning of interbank lending markets can help reduce funding liquidity risk because banks can obtain loans in this market quickly and at little cost. When interbank markets are dysfunctional or strained, banks face a greater funding liquidity risk which in extreme cases can result in insolvency.
Longer-term trends in banks' sources of funds.
In the past, checkable deposits were US banks’ most important source of funds; in 1960, checkable deposits comprised more than 60 percent of banks’ total liabilities. Over time, however, the composition of banks’ balance sheets has changed significantly. In lieu of customer deposits, banks have increasingly turned to short-term liabilities such as commercial paper (CP), certificates of deposit (CDs), repurchase agreements (repos), swapped foreign exchange liabilities, and brokered deposits.
Benchmarks for short-term lending rates.
Interest rates in the unsecured interbank lending market serve as reference rates in the pricing of numerous financial instruments such as floating rate notes (FRNs), adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), and syndicated loans. These benchmark rates are also commonly used in corporate cashflow analysis as discount rates. Thus, conditions in the unsecured interbank market can have wide-reaching effects in the financial system and the real economy by influencing the investment decisions of firms and households.
Efficient functioning of the markets for such instruments relies on well-established and stable reference rates. The benchmark rate used to price many US financial securities is the three-month US dollar Libor rate. Up until the mid-1980s, the Treasury bill rate was the leading reference rate. However, it eventually lost its benchmark status to Libor due to pricing volatility caused by periodic, large swings in the supply of bills. In general, offshore reference rates such as the US dollar Libor rate are preferred to onshore benchmarks since the former are less likely to be distorted by government regulations such as capital controls and deposit insurance.
Monetary policy transmission.
Central banks in many economies implement monetary policy by manipulating instruments to achieve a specified value of an operating target. Instruments refer to the variables that central banks directly control; examples include reserve requirements, the interest rate paid on funds borrowed from the central bank, and balance sheet composition. Operating targets are typically measures of bank reserves or short-term interest rates such as the overnight interbank rate. These targets are set to achieve specified policy goals which differ across central banks depending on their specific mandates.1
US federal funds market.
US monetary policy implementation involves intervening in the unsecured interbank lending market known as the fed funds market. Federal funds (fed funds) are uncollateralized loans of reserve balances at Federal Reserve banks. The majority of lending in the fed funds market is overnight, but some transactions have longer maturities. The market is an over-the-counter (OTC) market where parties negotiate loan terms either directly with each other or through a fed funds broker. Most of these overnight loans are booked without a contract and consist of a verbal agreement between parties. Participants in the fed funds market include: commercial banks, savings and loan associations, branches of foreign banks in the US, federal agencies, and primary dealers.
Depository institutions in the US are subject to reserve requirements, regulations set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve which oblige banks to keep a specified amount of funds (reserves) in their accounts at the Fed as insurance against deposit outflows and other balance sheet fluctuations. It is common for banks to end up with too many or too few reserves in their accounts at the Fed. Up until October 2008, banks had the incentive to lend out idle funds since the Fed did not pay interest on excess reserves
Interest rate channel of monetary policy.
The interest rate channel of monetary policy refers to the effect of monetary policy actions on interest rates that influence the investment and consumption decisions of households and businesses. Along this channel, the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy relies on linkages between central bank instruments, operating targets, and policy goals. For example, when the Federal Reserve conducts open market operations in the federal funds market, the instrument it is manipulating is its holdings of government securities. The Fed's operating target is the overnight federal funds rate and its policy goals are maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. For the interest rate channel of monetary policy to work, open market operations must affect the overnight federal funds rate which must influence the interest rates on loans extended to households and businesses.
As explained in the previous section, many US financial instruments are actually based on the US dollar Libor rate, not the effective federal funds rate. Successful monetary policy transmission thus requires a linkage between the Fed's operating targets and interbank lending reference rates such as Libor. During the 2007 financial crisis, a weakening of this linkage posed major challenges for central banks and was one factor that motivated the creation of liquidity and credit facilities. Thus, conditions in interbank lending markets can have important effects on the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.
Strains in interbank lending markets during the 2007 financial crisis.
By mid-2007, cracks started to appear in markets for asset-backed securities. For example, in June 2007, ratings agencies downgraded over 100 bonds backed by second-lien subprime mortgages. Soon after, the investment bank Bear Stearns liquidated two hedge funds that had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and a few large mortgage lenders filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Strains in interbank lending markets became apparent on August 9, 2007, after BNP Paribas announced that it was halting redemptions on three of its investment funds. That morning the US dollar Libor rate climbed over 10 basis points (bps) and remained elevated thereafter. The US Libor-OIS spread ballooned to over 90 in September whereas it had averaged 10 in prior months. 
At the following FOMC meeting (September 18, 2007), the Fed started to ease monetary policy aggressively in response to the turmoil in financial markets. In the minutes from the September FOMC meeting, Fed officials characterize the interbank lending market as significantly impaired:
"“Banks took measures to conserve their liquidity and were cautious about counterparties’ exposures to asset-backed commercial paper. Term interbank funding markets were significantly impaired, with rates rising well above expected future overnight rates and traders reporting a substantial drop in the availability of term funding.”"
By the end of 2007, the Federal Reserve had cut the fed funds target rate by 100bps and initiated several liquidity-providing programs and yet the Libor-OIS spread remained elevated. Meanwhile, for most of 2008, term funding conditions remained stressed. In September 2008, when the US government decided not to bail out the investment bank Lehman Brothers, credit markets went from being strained to completely broken and the Libor-OIS spread blew out to over 350bps.
Possible explanations.
Increase in counterparty risk.
An increase in counterparty risk reduces lending banks’ expected payoffs from providing unsecured funds to other banks and thus lowers their incentive to transact with one another. This is a result from Stiglitz and Weiss (1981): the expected return on a loan to a bank is a decreasing function of the riskiness of the loan. Stiglitz and Weiss also show that increases in funding costs can lead safe borrowers to drop out of the market, making the remaining pool of borrowers more risky. Thus, adverse selection may have exacerbated strains in interbank lending markets once Libor rates were on the rise.
The market environment at the time was not inconsistent with an increase in counterparty risk and a higher degree of information asymmetry. In the second half of 2007, market participants and regulators started to become aware of the risks in securitized products and derivatives. Many banks were in the process of writing down the values of their mortgage-related portfolios. House prices were falling all over the country and the ratings agencies had just started to downgrade subprime mortgages. Concerns about structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and mortgage and bond insurers were growing. Moreover, there was very high uncertainty about how to value complex securitized instruments and where in the financial system these securities were concentrated.
Liquidity hoarding.
Another possible explanation for the seizing up of interbank lending is that banks were hoarding liquidity in anticipation of future shortages. Two modern features of the financial industry suggest this hypothesis is not implausible. First, banks have come to rely much less on deposits as a source of funds and more on short-term wholesale funding (brokered CDs, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), interbank repurchase agreements, etc.). Many of these markets came under stress during the early phase of the crisis, particularly the ABCP market. This meant banks had fewer sources of funds to turn to, although an increase in retail deposits over this period provided some offset. 
Second, it has become common for corporations to turn to markets rather than banks for short-term funding. In particular, before the crisis firms were regularly tapping commercial paper markets for funds. These corporations still had lines of credit set up with banks, but they used them more as a source of insurance. After the near collapse of the commercial paper market, however, firms took advantage of this insurance and banks had no choice but to provide the liquidity. Thus, firms’ use of credit lines during the crisis increased illiquidity risks for banks. Lastly, banks’ off-balance sheet programs (SIVs for example) relied on short-term ABCP to operate; when this market dried up, banks in some cases had to take the assets from these vehicles onto their balance sheets. All of these factors made liquidity risk management especially challenging during this time.
Glossary of key interbank lending rates.
United States.
Effective federal funds rate.
The effective federal funds rate is the weighted average rate at which banks lend to each other in the overnight fed funds market; also known as the US overnight rate. Note that the effective fed funds rate is different from the target fed funds rate, which is the rate decided on by members of the Federal Open Market Committee when they meet several times a year to discuss monetary policy.
US dollar Libor rate.
The US dollar Libor rate, short for the London interbank offer rate, is the rate at which banks indicate they are willing to lend to other banks for a specified term. More specifically it is the British Banker's Association average of interbank rates for dollar deposits in the London market. Term Libor rates reflect the expected path of monetary policy as well as a risk premium associated with credit and liquidity risks.
A current issue is the reliability of that index (see libor scandal)

A History of Fly Fishing for Trout

A History of Fly Fishing for Trout is a fly fishing book written by John Waller Hills published in London in 1921.
Synopsis.
"A History of Fly Fishing for Trout" is the first book to trace the history of fly fishing from its very beginning, with chapters on Early Sporting Literature, Early Fly Fishing in France, and identifying all the artificial flies mentioned by early writers. With a useful bibliography.
Reviews.
It covers the period from the close of the 15th century to the beginning of the 20th, from the Treatyse to Andrew Lang. The story is very well told and must have involved considerable research. Generous in his appreciations, he can always be relied upon to give an unbiased judgement. The book sets a high standard and one can refer to him with confidence on moot points in angling literature on trout fly-fishing.
All three of these writers--Robb, Hills and Marston--get at the real meaning of the old writers, quote them and characterize them, point our the significance of their contributions, and show both where they are still valid and where later developments have improved them.

Skullbuster

Skullbuster is the name of three comic book super villains all of which exist in Marvel Comics' main shared universe. The original Skullbuster first appeared in "Uncanny X-Men" #229 (May 1988) and was created by Chris Claremont and Marc Silvestri.
Original Skullbuster.
The cyborg Skullbuster was a member of the original Reavers, a gang of cyborgs living in a ghost town in Australia, who perpetrated robberies across the globe. Skullbuster, as well as Pretty Boy and Bonebreaker, avoided being sent through the Siege Perilous along with the other Reavers after being defeated by the X-Men. Under the leadership of Donald Pierce, the remaining Reavers allied themselves with Lady Deathstrike and her minions and began training to defeat the X-Men. The Reavers never ended up battling the X-Men but encountered Wolverine, beat him half to death, and then crucified him. After Wolverine escaped, the Reavers attacked Muir Island where Skullbuster was shot and seemingly killed by Forge. Skullbuster was not seen again for several years and Pierce recruited the badly injured Cylla Markham giving her cybernetic enhancements and the code name Skullbuster. When Lady Deathstrike kidnapped Milo Thurman, the mutant mercenary known as Domino tracked them down and subsequently battled Deathstrike, Pierce, and Skullbuster. Pierce revealed that he resurrected Skullbuster by copying his cybernetic mainframe. Skullbuster whereabouts are unknown since his encounter with Domino. When the Reavers and the Shadow King battled the X-treme X-Men, a new Skullbuster was present and there was no mention of the original.
Cylla Markham Skullbuster.
Formerly a pilot, Cylla agreed to help Banshee and Forge in finding their missing teammates, but the plane was shot down by Fenris. Fatally injured, Cylla was rushed to a hospital and was invited by Donald Pierce to join him in exchange for her health. She agreed to become a cyborg, joining Pierce's Reavers. Though she was replacing the original Skullbuster, Cylla mainly went by her real name. Her first mission brought her into contact with Wolverine, and she was defeated through the combined efforts of Jubilee and Yukio. After the supposed deaths of the other Reavers, Cylla and Lady Deathstrike fled. Cylla later resurfaced, allying herself with Bloodscream in an attempt to murder Wolverine. However, Bloodscream betrayed her and sucked the life from her, killing her.
Legacy.
Outside of her membership with the Reavers, little has been revealed about the third Skullbuster. She participated in Shadow King's failed attack on the X-treme X-Men and after being defeated was handed over to the police.
Powers and abilities.
Like the other members of the Reavers, Skullbuster is a cyborg and has bionic implants that augment strength, stamina, leaping, and reflexes beyond the levels of a normal human. 
The implants of Skullbuster also include infrared optic scanners, a plasma grenade launcher, and machine guns. 
<br>
The implants of Skullbuster also include steel wrist claws, an on-board targeting computer, a plasma blaster, and thermite launchers. <br>
The implants of Skullbuster also absorb the energy from attacks and power sources.

Berlin Modernism Housing Estates

Berlin Modernism Housing Estates consists of six subsidized housing estates (Siedlungen) that testify to innovative housing policies from 1910 to 1933, especially during the Weimar Republic, when the city of Berlin was particularly progressive socially, politically and culturally. The properties are outstanding examples of the building reform movement that contributed to improving housing and living conditions for people with low incomes through novel approaches to town planning, architecture and garden design. The estates also provide exceptional examples of new urban and architectural typologies, featuring fresh design solutions, as well as technical and aesthetic innovations. 
Bruno Taut, Martin Wagner and Walter Gropius were among the leading architects of these projects which exercised considerable influence on the development of housing around the world.

Rusty Wescoatt

Rusty Wescoatt (August 2, 1911 - September 3, 1987) was an American supporting actor who appeared in over 80 films between 1947 and 1965, according to the Internet Movie Database.
Wescoatt was an expert at playing the "henchmen" role in B-Westerns and serials, as he had a satisfactory career in both. But Wescoatt's main studio for serial mayhem was Columbia. His screen persona was usually a bully who, often had more brawn than brains, did the physical labor according to the strict orders given by the "brains heavy". 
During each mission, Wescoatt went from one chapter to the next trying desperately to kill the hero with fists, knives, guns, bombs, ropes, or whatever else happened to be handy at the time. But he was a bad luck man, because most of the time he had to face distinguished serials heroes. This way, Robert Lowery realled mauled him in "Batman and Robin"; George Reeves pummeled him in "The Adventures of Sir Galahad"; Kirk Alyn tried to teach him the error of his ways in two Superman cliffhangers, and Buster Crabbe knocked him every time in "The Sea Hound" and "King of the Congo". At that was just in the serials, when not getting knocked around saloons in westerns.
As a change of pace, Wescoatt eventually played as a detective in "Touch of Evil", policeman or deputy sheriff in several movies, suggesting he could play a law enforcement’s role. Then, after the westerns and serials faded in the mid-1950s he migrated to television work, acting in classic TV western series, specially in the "Death Valley Days" anthology, and also appeared in two films with the Three Stooges after their 1959 resurgence in popularity.
Wescoatt died in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 76.

Mwine has appeared in movies including "Blood Diamond", where he made his film debut. His first appearance in television was in "New York Undercover", in 1995. Recent appearances include a recurring role as the mysterious Usutu in "Heroes". Mwine originally had the role of "Joseph" in the unaired pilot episode of the show; this part was removed when NBC took on the show full-time, due to the character's plot revolving around terrorist activity. Mwine also appeared as Tom Adler in and as Maurice Devereaux in "The Riches".
Mwine currently plays a minor, yet recurring, character in HBO and David Simon's new television series "Treme". The series deals with life in the Tremé district of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
Photography.
Mwine's photographic work has been displayed at the United Nations, The Latino Art Museum in Pomona, California, UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History, and other museums worldwide. It was a central focus of "Biro", and prominently featured on Six Feet Under. His photography has also appeared in Vanity Fair.
Stage.
Mwine began appearing in stage productions in 1992, appearing as the conman posing as the son of Sidney Poitier in "Six Degrees of Separation", and in "The Riddles Of Race, Circa '68" in 1994, In 1992 and 1997, Mwine was nominated for a Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Non-Resident Production, for his part in "Six Degrees of Separation" at The National Theatre and "Nomathemba" — at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.. He played Julius Van George in "Scent of the Roses" at the Seattle Contemporary Theatre in 1998.
His first effort as a playwright, a barestage one-man show entitled "Biro", about a HIV-positive Ugandan former rebel soldier who enters the United States illegally for treatment. The play, based on a 90-minute explanation from the eponymous character to his lawyer about how he came to be in a Texas jail cell, premiered in early 2003 at Uganda's National Theatre, before showing at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in New York, as well as in Los Angeles, Seattle, London, and throughout Africa. He performed it in front of multiple African heads of state and then-UN General Secretary Kofi Annan in 2004. The "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" described his performance as "radiant", particularly so given the dark subject matter.
Documentary work.
Mwine's inaugural documentary, "Beware of Time", screened in 2004 at the Pan African Film Festival in Los Angeles and the Black International Cinema in Berlin. Describing the lives of HIV-positive Ugandans, it was named the Best Film on Matters Relating to Marginalized People, and features a rare interview with Amule Amin, Idi Amin's brother.

Indiana Botanic Gardens

The Indiana Botanic Gardens is the largest and oldest retailer of herbs in the United States. It celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010.
Founder.
Born in Wisconsin in 1878, Joseph Meyer acquired a curiosity about plants and nature at a young age. His father, who was a photographer, often took Meyer out on assignments into forests and fields. From here, he learned a great deal about various aspects of nature. Complications in Meyer's family and financial life caused him to temporarily step aside from nature and take up a more practical career in printing. Meyer soon found himself in Chicago working for a large printer. Not long after, a strike shut down the printer and Meyer found himself at The Hammond Times.
After settling in Hammond, Meyer desired to have a business of his own, preferably something in the printing industry. Giving consideration to his set of skills, Meyer realized that he knew a great deal about printing and even more about nature. A company that sold herbs through a catalog would be a profitable endeavor thanks to his possession of an old printing press and vast knowledge of natural remedies. It was with the blending of these two passions that gave birth to Indiana Botanic Gardens.
The company.
The name Indiana Botanic Gardens is a privately owned, family run business that operates within the vitamin and herbal supplement industry. The Indiana Botanic Gardens has had a rich history within the Northwest Indiana region for nearly 100 years. Its history can be read about in botanical and herbal publications, as well as literature pertaining to the history of the Calumet Region. Indiana Botanic Gardens was founded in 1910 by horticulturalist/herbalist Joseph Meyer (1878–1950) in a small cottage in the rear of his home in Hammond, Indiana.
Initially called the Indiana Herb Gardens, the business barely made living expenses for the large Meyer family which eventually consisted of seven sons and one daughter. Joseph Meyer's elder sons helped their father to grow the business by gathering herbs from the nearby fields. The family diligently and untiringly packed boxes, filled orders, fed the printing press, and folded circulars during the day. The daily workload for the Meyer's often bled into their evenings where they put catalogs together by binding them with needles and thread.
Once the company began to sustain itself, it moved from Meyer's cottage to a more formal and larger building off of Calumet Avenue in Hammond, Indiana. Due in part to his roots as a printer, Joseph E. Meyer published a 400-page book in 1918 entitled, "The Herbalist". Seven years later The Herbalist Almanac, an annual publication, was produced in 1925. The Herbalist Almanac was an eclectic booklet that contained everything from listings of the herbs and roots that the company sold, recipes, Indian weather forecasts, treatments for common ailments, popular songs of the day, to advice on farming issues. In 1979, after fifty-four years of publication, The Herbalist Almanac was retired. Vintage copies of The Herbalist Almanac are still around, some dating back to the 1950s, and can be purchased online through book shops and Ebay. There are many collectors and agricultural, botanical, and gardening enthusiasts that have copies. Colleges and universities still study and use the almanac for educational reasons in many horticulture classes. The University of Florida has done their fair share of preserving these almanacs seeing that they have a vast collection ranging from 1929-1971 in their rare books collection. A copy of The Herbalist can even be found in the Smithsonian Institution Library.
Later in 1925, Meyer purchased a wild tract of land on the Little Calumet River. The land held a profusion of medicinal plants, shrubbery, and virgin forest. One year later, in 1926, this fertile ground would become home to the newly named Indiana Botanic Gardens. The offices and warehouse were now housed in a English gabled building. The grounds and gardens covered and were filled with beautiful landscaping and architecture. The property also featured a mill where all of the botanicals were manufactured.
During the next few years, Meyer traveled to all parts of North America to gather material and information on native plants and their uses. Mail poured in from all over the world including universities, libraries, botanists and people from all ranks of life. In 1932, he traveled to Europe to seek rare herbals. In Joseph Meyer's time, self-treatment with herbs was commonly practiced and often necessary due to economic conditions or the scarcity of professional medical help. Meyer devoted his life to providing herbs to people, and many grateful customers sent letters and recipes extolling the benefits. "The Old Herb Doctor" was compiled from this information to let other customers know how other customers had used herbs and the good results they obtained from them.
The business has been handed down from generation to generation on to his grandson David Meyer, who is still part of the organization, along with great-grandson Tim Cleland, current president of the company. In 1990, the company moved into a more modern facility in nearby Hobart, Indiana. Although no longer a grower of herbs, Indiana Botanic Gardens sells vitamins, essential oils, teas, beauty care products, and other nutritional supplements in addition to being a distributor of bulk herbals. The Hobart location has a retail store that contains the majority of the Botanic Choice line and also sells wholesale products. The bulk of the business continues to be derived from mail order catalog sales; however, with the re-launch of their website in May 2008, the Indiana Botanic Gardens have been focusing on expanding their online operations.

How He Lied to Her Husband

How He Lied to Her Husband is a one-act comedy play by George Bernard Shaw, who wrote it, at the request of actor Arnold Daly, over a period of four days while he was vacationing in Scotland in 1905. In its preface he described it as "a sample of what can be done with even the most hackneyed stage framework by filling it in with an observed touch of actual humanity instead of with doctrinaire romanticism." He added, "Nothing in the theatre is staler than the situation of husband, wife and lover, or the fun of knockabout farce. I have taken both, and got an original play out of them, as anybody else can if only he will look about him for his material instead of plagiarizing "Othello" and the thousand plays that have proceeded on Othello's romantic assumptions and false point of honour." The original 1905 cast were Harley Granville-Barker as Henry Apjohn, A. G. Poulton as Teddy Bompas, and Gertrude Kingston as Aurora Bompas.
Plot synopsis.
The three-character play is set in the drawing room of a flat located on Cromwell Road in London. Shaw describes Henry Apjohn as "a very beautiful youth, moving as in a dream, walking as on air," while Aurora Bompas has "an air of being a young and beautiful woman but as a matter of hard fact, she is, dress and pretensions apart, a very ordinary South Kensington female of about 37, hopelessly inferior in physical and spiritual distinction to the beautiful youth." The third character is Aurora's husband Teddy, "a robust, thicknecked, well groomed city man, with a strong chin but a blithering eye and credulous mouth."
Aurora is distressed because she has misplaced some poems, in which she is identified by name, written for her with declarations of love by the impetuous Henry. She suspects her sister-in-law Georgina stole them from her workbox and is concerned she will read them to Aurora's husband Teddy.
Henry suggests they confront Teddy with the truth, "quietly, hand in hand" and depart - "without concealment and subterfuge, freely and honestly, in full honor and self-respect" - for their planned evening at the theatre. (Henry has purchased tickets for "Candida" - the popular Shaw comedy which Henry and Aurora's situation closely resembles - because "Lohengrin" was sold out.) The two engage in a discussion about the merits of revealing their affair until Teddy arrives and confronts Henry with his poetry.
The young man tries to convince him they were inspired by Aurora, the goddess of dawn, rather than his wife, and assures him he has no interest in the woman Teddy married . . . which the cuckolded man finds so insulting he demands Henry admit how desirable Aurora is. Henry finally confesses his love for Aurora, which pleases Teddy so much he proposes he have the poems published on "the finest paper, sumptuous
binding, everything first class" as a tribute to his wife. "What shall we call the volume?," Teddy asks. ""To Aurora", or something like that, eh?," to which Henry replies, "I should call it "How He Lied to Her Husband"."
Adaptations.
Frank Launder and Cecil Lewis adapted Shaw's play for a 1931 British short film directed by Lewis and starring Edmund Gwenn as Teddy, Vera Lennox as Aurora, and Robert Harris as Henry. A July 1937 BBC broadcast starred Greer Garson, D.A. Clarke-Smith, and Derek Williams.

Shawty Lo

Carlos Walker (born March 31, 1976), better known by his stage name Shawty Lo, is an American hip hop recording artist from Atlanta, Georgia. Walker is a founding member of the Southern hip hop group D4L and in 2003, founded D4L Records. He is perhaps best known for his debut single "Dey Know", which was included on his solo debut album "Units in the City", released in February 2008. In June 2011, Walker announced he signed his D4L imprint, to fellow American rapper 50 Cent's G-Unit Records, in a joint venture deal.
Music career.
2003-2006: Career beginnings with D4L.
In 2003, Shawty Lo formed the hip hop group D4L, with fellow Atlanta-based rappers Fabo, Mook-B and Stoney. Shawty Lo subsequently launched his indie record label D4L Records. Shawty Lo self-funded the group in its early days. He explained that the group's name stands for "Down for Life". The group signed to the indie label Dee Money Entertainment, which released the group's debut in conjunction with Asylum Records. Their debut album, titled "Down for Life", was executive produced by Shawty Lo and eventually certified gold by theRecording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album had spawned the hit singles "Betcha Can't Do It Like Me" and "Laffy Taffy". The latter of which attributed much to the group's success, as it broke records as the most downloaded song in the history of music according to the 2007 Guinness Book of the World Records. It was also a multi-platinum ring tone and scored a prestigious ASCAP award.
The group debuted with "Betcha Can't Do It Like Me", which "Billboard" claimed to have popularized snap music. In January 2006, D4L's single "Laffy Taffy", reached the top of the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. As was another Atlanta-based hip hop group Dem Franchize Boyz, D4L was part of the snap music trend in 2006, which continued when Mississippi-based rapper Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, came out with the No. 1 hit song "Crank That (Soulja Boy)", in 2007.
2007-2008: Solo career and "Units in the City".
On December 4, 2007, Shawty Lo released "Dey Know",his solo commercial debut single. The single charted in the Top 40 of the "Billboard" Hot 100. On February 26, 2008, his solo debut album "Units in the City", was released. The album peaked at #14 on the "Billboard" 200 and at #2 on the Top Rap Albums chart, selling over 160,000 copies to date. The album spawned two other singles, "Dunn Dunn" and the remix to "Foolish".
The album features guest appearances from Shawty Lo's D4L cohorts and Gucci Mane, among others. Shawty Lo also released a music video for the album cut, "Got Em 4 da LO".
The songs "Dey Know" and "Foolish", were both officially remixed, featuring new verses from several high-profile artists. These include Ludacris, Young Jeezy, Plies, Lil' Wayne, DJ Khaled, Birdman, Rick Ross and Jim Jones. The "Foolish" music video also included cameo appearances from Pitbull, Jadakiss and Ace Hood.
2010–present: "Still Got Units".
Shawty Lo's second solo album, "Bankhead Born & Raised: Carlos" is set to be released soon. Artists to be featured include Rick Ross, T-Pain, Lil' Kim, Bun B, Nate Butler, Lyfe Jennings, T.I., Lil Wayne, and Gucci Mane. Shawty Lo confirmed that Atlanta, GA, which features Gucci Mane, Ludacris and The-Dream, will be the first single released from the album. The album is also notable for "Roll the Dice", a song which marks the end of the beef between himself and rapper T.I.
On June 10, 2011, it was confirmed by both Shawty Lo and Allhiphop.com that he has signed a large deal with G-Unit Records after it was reported they were in talks. Shawty Lo said, "My new situation with G-Unit was just solidified and I got off the phone with 50 yesterday, I just signed a really large deal,” when talking to allhiphop.com. As well as, “It's like a new beginning and all I needed was someone behind me. 50 Cent is a marketing genius and I got my new thing D4L and G-Unit and we going to be working the south and the rest of the world if need be". It was later clarified by Shawty Lo that he had not signed as an artist but instead he had signed his label D4L Records to G-Unit.
Controversy.
T.I..
In 2008, Shawty Lo was involved in a highly publicized feud with another Atlanta rapper, T.I.. The feud was characterized by Shawty Lo's track "Dunn Dunn", and T.I.'s reply "What Up, What's Haapnin". The song "Dunn Dunn" appears to question T.I.'s roots in Bankhead. The music video for "What Up, What's Haapnin" was shot in Bowen Homes. In an interview, T.I. insisted that his song "No Matter What" was only partially aimed at Shawty Lo. The feud reached its climax at the November 2008 "Dirty Awards" where the entourages of both artists clashed during the ceremony, forcing it to be shut down. Two incidents forced police to use pepper-spray and evacuate the audience. The feud was publicly ended on March 7, 2009, when Shawty Lo and T.I. appeared on-stage together at Club Crucial in Bankhead, for T.I.'s farewell concert. After this performance, T.I. gave an interview to MTV, in which he stated that the feud with Shawty Lo was exaggerated by the media, and was not a 'beef'. Shawty Lo also made a song "Roll the Dice", a song which samples Coldplay's popular 2008 single "Viva la Vida". "Roll the Dice" marks the end of the feud between Shawty Lo and T.I.
All My Babies' Mamas.
His TV series, "All My Babies' Mamas" was set to air later in 2013 on the Oxygen channel, but has garnered controversy and calls from the NAACP to be cancelled due to its alleged stereotypical nature. On January 15, 2013, Oxygen Media cancelled the show, stating in a press release that "as part of our development process, we have reviewed casting and decided not to move forward with the special." But On February 26, 2013 Shawty Lo announced that there were other television networks that were interested in the reality show.
Personal life.
By the age of 17, Carlos had fathered his first child, and his grandmother died. He now has a total of eleven children: nine daughters and two sons from ten women.

Erich Feigl

Erich Feigl (1931 – January 27, 2007) was an Austrian documentary film producer and author. He produced almost 60 documentaries, mostly for the Austrian ORF but some for BR (Bavarian), ZDF (German) and TRT (Turkish Radio Television) in co-production. He authored books about the Habsburgs, whose restoration he supported, and the Armenian Genocide, which he described as a "myth".
Biography.
Erich Feigl was born in Vienna, Austria. He began writing while still a student, but soon switched over to documentary film-making, continuing his career at Austrian State Television (ORF). He toured the Middle and Near East and Western Asia extensively and produced many documentaries about these places and their cultures and religions (""Journey to the Early Christian World", "Men and Myths""). He worked with the Dalai Lama on various projects (""Bardo"", ""Rebirth""). 
Feigl became interested in Turkic cultures and history, especially (""Kanuni Sultan""). After 1984 he began writing about the Armenian Genocide, and he subsequently also focused his attention on Kurdish issues and the PKK guerrilla organization, which resulted in his book published under the title "Die Kurden" in 1995. He was one of the first authors and commentators to investigate this topic in a contemporary context. He also wrote about the history of the Habsburgs (""Kaiser Karl"", ""Kaiserin Zita"").
Feigl was a long-time monarchist activist, and in 2006 was awarded honorary membership of the Black-Yellow Alliance, which favors the return of the House of Habsburg to power.
Described by "Der Spiegel" as a "fervent admirer" of Empress Zita, he was part of the monarchist committee which organized her funeral in 1989.
Feigl received the Medal for the Progress of the Republic of Azerbaijan and was an honorary Board member of the Congress of European Azeris.
Feigl had died of kidney failure after being hospitalised for a stomach hemorrhage and was buried on February 5 at Simmering Cemetery in Vienna after a funeral at Feuerhalle Hall.
A Myth of Terror.
In 1986 Feigl became well known after the publication of his controversial book "A Myth of Terror: Armenian Extremism: Its Causes and Its Historical Context". In the book's introduction, Feigl said he had written it as a response to the murder of close friend and Turkish labour attaché, Erdogan Özen, by the members of the Armenian Revolutionary Army. Initially published in German, an English version was later produced. Complimentary copies of the book were distributed by Turkish organisations to US governmental officials, university libraries and individuals. A short time before he died he finished his last book, called "Armenian Mythomania".
Dagmar Lorenz, professor of Germanic Studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago, in a book review of author Edgar Hilsenrath for the Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual, notes Feigl as a supporter of "Turkish cryptofascist anti-Armenian propaganda" and condemns "A Myth of Terror" as a "revisionist publication" that "abounds with misleading details".
Feigl's work was also criticized by prof. Klas-Göran Karlsson for misinterpretations.
Michael Gunter describes the book by saying "despite many glaring deficiencies and unnecessary repetitions, it surprisingly makes a partially successful case" and points out that the books is not a scholarly study in the normal sense.

Jerky Versions of the Dream

Jerky Versions of the Dream is the only solo album recorded by Howard Devoto, original singer of Buzzcocks and Magazine. It was his only studio album, which was released at the time with two singles, "Cold Imagination" and "Rainy Season", being a short-lived solo career for Devoto, who in 1986, went to form a band alongside guitarist Noko, which later was named Luxuria.
Recording.
The process of Devoto's solo album began, shortly after the demise of Magazine. Already frustrated by an unsatisfactory string of replacements for guitarist John McGeoch, Devoto left the group after the pre-album single to "Magic, Murder and the Weather" had failed to chart. Devoto started to write songs during 1982, later making a demo with guitarist Alan St Clair and a drum machine. He also started working with his former Magazine bandmate Barry Adamson. Eventually, Devoto decided to combine the two projects and record a solo album, instead.
Release.
The album was released in United States on the I.R.S. label, on 26 July 1983.
The first single to be released from the album was "Rainy Season", which was considered by many to be a stand-out track. The song's video was heavily rotated on MTV. On the release of the album it peaked at #57, on the UK album chart. It was eagerly anticipated and widely received by amazing reviews. A subsequent tour in Europe, the United States, and Canada was full of sold out crowds. However, the album's second single, "Cold Imagination", failed to chart as well, and Devoto's solo career was put on hold.
Track listing.
All songs written by Howard Devoto except where noted.

Made in Sheffield (album)

Made in Sheffield is a 2008 album by Tony Christie, released on 10 November, 2008.
Production.
After hearing the song "Coles Corner" by Richard Hawley on the radio, Christie suggested that it was the type of production he should be striving for. Christie approached Hawley to request his production duties on a new version of the track. Hawley had previously sent him the album "Coles Corner" on its release in 2005 and readily agreed to produce a whole album with his co-producer Colin Elliott at their Yellow Arch Studios in Sheffield.
The recording project developed into a concept that the album should only feature songs written by Sheffield’s own songwriters, and new songs by Tony himself. Amongst those involved were the Arctic Monkeys who supplied the album's opener "Only Ones Who Know", Jarvis Cocker ("Born To Cry", a Pulp song from the Notting Hill soundtrack), a stripped down piano and trumpet reworking of The Human League's synthpop classic "Louise" and a reworking of "Coles Corner" by Richard Hawley. Also involved were lesser known city songwriters Martin Bragger who contributes two songs ("Danger Is A Woman In Love" and "Paradise Square") and Sara Jay and Mark Sheridan.
Tony Christie said of the project ""We are a proud community and the artists that have hailed from Sheffield are some of the most exciting and successful UK artists in pop history. I wanted to celebrate our culture.""
The album was generally positively received on release including the NME, The Observer, Times and The Guardian. The NME in particular labelled it as an 'unexpected delight and genuinely great record' and gave the album 7/10. The Guardian gave the album 4/5 labelling it 'a beautifully crafted album'. MusicOMH described it as a 'quite dignified record'.

Marcus Whitman Middle/High School

Marcus Whitman High School is a middle/high-school located in Rushville, New York. It is part of the Marcus Whitman Central School District. The school was named after Marcus Whitman, the famous missionary and physician. The middle and high schools are both connected as part of the same building. Also located on the campus is the BOCES building for "Wayne Finger Lakes BOCES", which is right next to the school building. Marcus Whitman is a rural school district, meaning its district includes many small towns and their outlying areas. It ranks second among school districts in New York for total area.
History.
Marcus Whitman Middle/High School was built in 1970, and was completed in 1971. The first graduating class was the class of '72.
In 2002, a large addition was built to the school which was to be the middle school. 2003 was the first year in which classes were held in the new building. With this setup, the schools are still connected, but are a little less integrated.
Also in 2002, a significant addition was made to the BOCES building.
Water tower.
Marcus Whitman Middle/High School is located on the top of a hill, hence the water pressure is not greatest. For this reason, it was decided that a water tower should be built so that school can remain in session should the power fail, and so that more water could easily be provided in the event of a fire. 
The water tower consists of blue and white steel silo sections on top of a concrete base. On the side of the word "WILDCATS" is painted, referring to the mascot of the school. 
The project met significant resistance among people in the area for cosmetic reasons and for the cost of the project.
Athletics.
The school has an athletics program that is much the same as any other school. The teams are referred to as the "Wildcats", or the "Whitman Wildcats". The school colors are blue and gold.
Justin Bieber show.
On April 15, 2010, Canadian singer Justin Bieber put on a private show at the Marcus Whitman High School gymnasium as the prize for winning a fundraising contest put on by 98PXY. Whitman collected over $3,000 in pennies for the Hillside Family of Agencies. In 2009, Whitman came in second place when a concert by Donnie Klang was the prize. Justin Bieber arrived at the school 2 hours late. The 10-minute concert was held on April 15, 2010.
On April 12, 2011, Marcus Whitman High School won the 98PXY High School Challenge again, this time earning a concert by the band The Ready Set. The Ready Set played for approximately 30 minutes. The date of the concert coincided with the release of a new single by the band, which was one of the songs played during the concert.

Leak noise correlator

A leak noise correlator is an electronic device used for Leak Detection and as a leak locator to find leaks in pressurized water or gas lines. 
Typically, microphones or acoustic sound sensors are placed in contact with the pipe, at two or more points, to record the sound emitted by a leak (e.g. a hissing noise) somewhere between the points. The sound data is processed through a mathematical algorithm which compares or correlates the two recordings to determine the difference in the times it takes noise to travel from the site of the leak to each of the sensors. If the distance between the sensors is known in advance, this timing information can be used to determine the location of the leak.,
The cross correlation signal of one continuous function, f, with another, g, is defined as:
where f * denotes the complex conjugate of f.
If f and g are two sound recordings of the noise produced by the leak, delayed in time by a different unknown amount, the time delay can be found by determining the time offset for which the cross correlation product has a maximum value. This approach should be accurate so long as the sound of the leak received at each sensor is sufficiently similar over a period of time.
Leak correlators require accurate information about the materials through which the leak sound is traveling in order to perform an accurate time calculation. The user normally has to input the size and type of pipe as well as the distances of the loggers from each other. Many standard pipe sizes have known speeds of sound which can be used for the calculation. If the materials are unknown, the speed of sound through the materials will have to be calculated on site to get an accurate leak correlation. 
Most correlators can also analyze the sound levels and sound frequencies to determine other information about the leak such as the size and severity of the leak or whether it's on the pipe, a valve or hydrant, or in a service line.
Most leak correlators serve two major purposes. First to detect the presence of a leak, second to pinpoint the location of the leak for repair when detected.

344th Air Refueling Squadron

The 344th Air Refueling Squadron (344 ARS) is part of the 22d Air Refueling Wing at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas. It operates the KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft conducting aerial refueling missions.
History.
Established as a B-24 Liberator heavy bomb squadron and trained by Third Air Force. Deployed to Egypt in June 1942 over South Atlantic Transport Route transiting from Morrision Field, Florida though the Caribbean to Brazil; performed trans-Atlantic crossing from Brazil to Liberia, then transited east across central Africa to Sudan. Lastly the group reformed with the ground echelon which traveled by ship around the Cape of Good Hope, joining with air echelon in British Palestine.
Assigned to the newly formed IX Bomber Command, the squadron operated from airfields in Egypt; Libya and Tunisia supporting the British Eighth Army in the Western Desert Campaign. Also staged long-range strategic bombardment of enemy military and industrial targets in Sicily; Italy and the Southern Balkans, including attacking the Nazi-Controlled oilfields at Polesti, Romania.
Re-assigned to Fifteenth Air Force in southern Italy; continuing strategic bombardment raids on Occupied France; Southern Germany; Austria and targets in the Balkans. In the summer of 1944, the squadron participated in the invasion of southern France, assisted in the Soviet advance into the Balkans, and supported the partisans and guerrillas in Yugoslavia and neighboring countries. 
The squadron returned to the United States in May 1945 where it was redesignated as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment squadron and began training for deployment to the Central Pacific Area. Training continued until November when the unit was transferred to Merced Army Air Field, California and reassigned to the 444th Bombardment Group, where it replaced the 678th Bombardment Squadron, which was converted into a reconnaissance unit. The squadron was inactivated at what was now Castle Field in March 1946.
Reactivated in 1947 as a Strategic Air Command B-29 Superfortress medium bomb squadron. Performed strategic bombardment training missions during the postwar era. In 1950 the squadron deployed to Far East Air Forces at Yokota Air Base, Japan and flew strategic bombardment missions over North Korea after the breakout of the Korean War. The squadron flew its first combat mission on 7 August, striking marshalling yards at Pyongyang, capital of North Korea. Attacked enemy communication lines and supported United Nations ground forces. Targets included rail facilities, oil centers, bridges, roads, troop concentrations, airfields, and military installations. Engaged in combat operations until the 1953 armistice, however the squadron remained in Japan until July 1954 when reassigned administratively to Lincoln AFB, Nebraska and its B-29s sent to storage and reclamation.
At Lincoln, re-equipped with new B-47E Stratojets. Engaged in strategic bombardment training with the B-47 throughout the rest of the 1950s, into the early 1960s. Inactivated in 1966 with the phaseout of the B-47 and closure of Lincoln AFB.
Reactivated in 1986 as an air refueling squadron.

J.T. and E.J. Crumbaugh Library

The J.T. and E.J. Crumbaugh Spiritualist Church and Public Library is a building housing both a church and a library in LeRoy, Illinois, opened on January 1, 1927. It was built after the deaths of James Thomas Crumbaugh and his wife Elizabeth Jane Crumbaugh as a memorial in accordance with their will.
History of the Library.
The library was donated to the community by James Thomas Crumbaugh. James Thomas was born on January 24, 1832 in the Empire Township of McLean County, Illinois. His parents were Daniel and Martha M. Robinson who were of German descent. J.T. grew up in McLean County with his twin brother Daniel T. Crumbaugh whom he would later become partners with on their farm. After a few years J.T. decided to rent out his farms and move to the town of LeRoy where he built his house at 313 East Center Street. 
J.T., along with his other brother, Leonard A. Crumbaugh and friend James Bonnette went on to establish the Citizens Bank, which would later become The first National Bank. 
On September 13, 1862 J.T. married Elizabeth Jane Wiley. Elizabeth was born on November 17, 1841 and was also raised in McLean County. Together they had one child together, a son only known as “Bright Eyes,” who was born on July 2, 1865 and later died on August 20th of the same year. The death of their son deepened the Crumbaugh’s interest in spiritualism which would stay with them for they rest of their lives. 
J.T. died on April 3, 1905 and Elizabeth followed less than a year later on January 24, 1906. Their will stated their desire for a library and a spiritualist church be built as a living memorial. Their heirs tried to fight the decision but their wishes were eventually upheld after five years of litigation. The library was opened on January 1, 1927 along with the Spiritualist Church both of which are still in use today.
JT and EJ Crumbaugh Memorial Library
Architecture of the Library.
The construction of the library and church was entrusted to F.C. Swartz, of Villa Grove, Illinois, for $60,000. The building itself was designed by Mr. A.L. Pillsbury of Bloomington, Illinois. Originally planned to be two separate buildings, it was decided to join them making one wing for the church and another for the library. The building has a colonial design and is made of Danville red brick along with Bedford stone finish. The stone carvings were done by Joseph Pertarde. Pertarde was originally from Rome, Italy but later lived in Peoria, Illinois and Bloomington, Illinois. His work can also be seen at Illinois Wesleyan School of Music, the Consistory in Bloomington, the McBarnes Memorial Building in Bloomington, the gymnasium in Illinois State University, and St. Peter's Church in Peoria. 
The Library.
The library itself is home to an estimated 14,000 volumes in a wide variety of genres. Since it is an endowed library any person is able to obtain a library card for free. In addition to its books, the library also provides computers, internet use and printer. It also has copies of the LeRoy Journal, the local newspaper, going back to 1903 on micro film. Other amenities include Parkland college classes on video, talking books for the visually impaired, and a home delivery service for citizens if LeRoy and Ellsworth, Illinois who are unable to leave their homes.
Genealogy Section.
The Crumbaugh Library's genealogy section began in the fall of 1977, with the Crumbaugh family bibles and family history were put on file at the library. Since then, the section has acquired over 500 family histories, mostly of local families. Any person can donate their family’s history to become a part of the genealogy section, which is for research purposes only, so the documents are not allowed out of the library. In addition to the LeRoy Journals the library has on file, they also have a large collection of LeRoy High School yearbooks going back to 1920. Other resources include: indexes of the marriages and deaths in LeRoy, as well as the Saybrook area, a collection of The Farmer City Mirror, a publication of the Farmer City Genealogical and Historical Society, a collection of The Gleanings, the McLean County Genealogical Society publication, and Oak Grove Cemetery records.
Museum.
The J.T. and E.J. Crumbaugh LIbrary also houses a museum which is dedicated to the history of LeRoy. The museum is located on the lower level of the library and is sponsored by the LeRoy Historical Society. It was opened on July 4, 1991 and contains memorabilia relevant to LeRoy’s history, including items from local businesses, schools and organizations.

Hypertree

A hypergraph "H" is called a hypertree, if it admits a host graph "T" such that "T" is a tree, in other words if there exists a tree "T" such that every hyperedge of "H" induces a subtree in "T". 
Since a tree is a hypertree, hypertrees may be seen as a generalization of the notion of a tree for hypergraphs. Any hypertree is isomorphic to some family of subtrees of a tree. 
Properties.
A hypertree has the Helly property (2-Helly property), i.e., if any two hyperedges from a subset of its hyperedges have a common vertex, then all hyperedges of the subset have a common vertex. 
The line graph of a hypertree is a chordal graph.
A hypergraph is a hypertree if and only if its dual hypergraph is conformal and chordal.

Greatest Hits (comics)

Greatest Hits is a six-issue comic book limited series, published in 2008 by DC Comics as a part of the Vertigo imprint. The series was written by David Tischman, with art by Glenn Fabry.
The series focuses on The Mates, a super-powered foursome from The Sixties, in the first superhero series from Vertigo since Grant Morrison's "The Invisibles".
Publication history.
The series ran for six issues dated November 2008 to April 2009. 
Characters.
The main character team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each character is a pastiche of a superhero, Tischma insisted the concept was much broader than that: "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. You are always going to have the really cute one. You are going to have the quiet one. You are going to have the spiritual one and you are going to have the goofy one. That’s the case from every group from Justice League to 'N Sync"
Plot.
The story is told through "Come Together", a "Behind the Music"-like documentary looking back on the team directed by Nick Mansfield, the son of one of The Mates. It then relates the history of the fictional universe's through the decades, each one bringing their own types of superhero.
Reception.
Martijn Form reviewed the first issue for Comics Bulletin and was not impressed: "the story's whole setup disappoints me." He also found the dialogue "mediocre" and the plotting "forced". However, Kris Bather at Broken Frontier felt that, while there was a lot going on, it still works well, with hints of Warren Ellis's superhero work (in particular his series "No Hero") and the art worked well with parallels to Steve Dillon's work. Comic Book Resources' Timothy Callahan was somewhere in between. He liked Fabry's cleaner line work suggesting "he's just about the perfect guy for this particular job" and while he didn't struggle as much with the plot jumping about in time he felt the part in the present was not as engaging or interesting as The Mates during the Sixties, although even this fell into a predictable pattern: "Okay, it's the Beatles as superheroes, but then what?".
Troy Stith at Comics Bulletin was positive about all aspects of the second issue. Fabry's art has "perfect feel for the story" and Tishman's dialogue "continues to capture the era and feeling of the situation." They concluded "I can only hope the art and storyline continue to carry on the way they have thus far."

List of highest mountain peaks in Washington

The following is a list of the highest mountain peaks in the State of Washington. All peaks are located in the Cascade Range, the largest of the mountain ranges in the state. Washington is one of only four states to have a high point reaching above 14,000 feet on Mount Rainier, the other states being Alaska, California, and Colorado.
Topographic elevation is the vertical distance above the reference geoid, a precise mathematical model of the Earth's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface. Topographic prominence is the elevation difference between the summit and the highest or key col to a higher summit. Topographic isolation is the minimum great circle distance to a point of higher elevation.
This article defines a major mountain peak as a summit with at least of topographic prominence and of elevation. An ultra prominent peak is a summit with at least of topographic prominence. Prior to its eruption in 1980, Mount St. Helens was at 9,677 ft (2,950 m), ranking number five on the list in both elevation and prominence, but is now reduced to 8,365 ft (2,550 m). Despite being far below the 2,700 meter minimum for inclusion, Mount St. Helens is the seventh highest in topographic prominence at 4,605 ft (1,404 m).

Phreatobius dracunculus

Phreatobius dracunculus is a species of catfish in the genus Phreatobius.
"P. dracunculus" was discovered from an artificial well in the village of Rio Pardo, located in the drainage area of the Rio Branco (Rio Madeira system, Amazon basin).
This small fish reaches a maximum length of SL. "P. dracunculus" differs from "P. cisternarum" in a number of ways, but the main differences are the absence of eyes (which are present in "P. cisternarum") and the lack of dark pigmentation in the skin (while in "P. cisternarum" some faint dark pigment is always present). These fish are light pink.

Phreatobius sanguijuela is a species of catfish in the genus Phreatobius.
This species was discovered in a hand-dug well in located within the Río Paraguá drainage, a tributary of the Río Iténez in Bolivia. This species is endangered by environmental degradation due to pollution, water extraction for drinking and irrigation, mineral extraction, and associated erosion. It is often killed when accidentally caught from wells because of a superficial resemblance to leeches.

Monsal Dale railway station

Monsal Dale railway station was opened in 1866 by the Midland Railway on its line from Rowsley, extending the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway.
The original intention was merely to have a goods depot to serve the nearby Cressbrook Mill, to be called Cressbrook or Cressbrook Sidings. However a passenger station would also serve the villages of Upperdale and Cressbrook.
The down line and platform was built on a shelf carved in the rock face, while the up was built on wooden trestles over the hillside. The wooden buildings for the latter were obtained from Evesham railway station.
It was written :
The station closed in 1959, the down platform edge can still be seen, nothing remains of the up platform or timber buildings.
From Monsal Dale, the line proceeded through Cressbrook and Litton tunnels to on its way north. Cut through solid limestone, they were both complex tunnels on a gradient of 1 in 100, and curved to allow the line to conform to the terrain.
Today this section of line forms part of the Monsal Trail, an walk and cycleway. The tunnels previously mentioned were re-opened in 2011, and the previous path diversions over the river via a permissive path by Cressbrook Mill are still available.

List of mountains of Switzerland

This page contains a table listing by elevation all mountains of Switzerland that have a topographic prominence of at least . The two mountainous regions are the Swiss Alps in the south and the Jura Mountains in the north.
Criteria.
The Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme defines a summit in the Alps as independent, if the connecting ridge between it and a higher summit drops at least 30 m (a prominence/drop of 30 m, with the lowest point referred to as the "key col"). There are over 4400 such summits exceeding 2000 m in Switzerland. In order for a peak to qualify as an independent mountain, traditionally a prominence of at least 300 m has been used. Inclusion based on prominence is expedient for its objectivity and verifiability, but has its drawbacks. For example, an impressive mountain peak dominating a valley may be connected via long high ridges to a barely higher hidden summit. Among the better-known peaks absent from this list are Fletschhorn (Lagginhorn), Mont Blanc de Cheilon (Ruinette), Nadelhorn and Täschhorn (Dom), Piz d'Err (Piz Calderas), Piz Badile (Piz Cengalo) and Piz Palü (Piz Zupò).
Accuracy.
All mountain heights and prominences on the list are from the largest-scale maps available.
However, heights sometime conflict on different scales. For example, the Fletschhorn is indicated to be 3993, 3982, and 3984.5 m high on the 1:100'000, 1:50'000 and 1:25'000 Swisstopo map, respectively. The (rounded) elevation given by the largest scale map is always used in this table.
Also, the deepest points in connecting ridges are not always survey points with spot elevations, so that heights have to be estimated from contour lines. For example, maps often provide heights for the place where a route passes over a ridge rather than for the lowest point of that pass.
Distribution.
The list contains 451 mountains with a prominence higher than 300 m, among which 24 are above 4000 m, 64 above 3500 m, 208 above 3000 m, 321 above 2500 m, 384 above 2000 m, 417 above 1500 m and 443 above 1000 m. The average and median heights are respectively 2812 and 2956 m. The great majority of the summits are located in the Alps, the other being located in the Jura Mountains. On average, each summit is the culminating point of an area corresponding to 91.5 km2.
These 451 major summits are found in 22 different cantons. 3 cantons (Valais, Bern and Graubünden) have summits above 4000 m, 9 cantons have summits above 3000 m, 15 cantons have summits above 2000 m and 21 cantons have summits above 1000 m. Two cantons have more than 100 summits: Graubünden (152) and Valais (104), while eleven cantons have less than 10 summits. 82 of the summits are on cantonal borders. A number of mountains (e.g. Titlis, Chasseral, Lägern) straddle borders as well, but have their summit on one side of the border. In the list, only the location of the culminating point is considered.

Nathan Rabin

Nathan Rabin (; born April 24, 1976) is an American film and music critic. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Rabin was the first head writer for "The A.V. Club", a position he held until 2013. Currently, he is a staff writer for The Dissolve, a film website operated by Pitchfork Media.
Life and career.
He coined the phrase manic pixie dream girl as a cinematic type. He was a panelist on the short-lived basic cable show "Movie Club with John Ridley" on American Movie Classics. In 2007, he began My Year of Flops on "The A.V. Club", where he re-evaluated films that were shunned by critics, ignored by audiences, or both, at their time of release. As of January 2008, the year was finished, but he continued the project as a bi-monthly feature. Other ongoing features Rabin wrote for "The A.V Club" include Dispatches From Direct-To-DVD Purgatory, a tongue-in-cheek look at DVD premieres, reviews for TV shows like "Louie", Silly Little Show-Biz Book Club, a humorous exploration of trashy books about entertainment, and Ephemereview, which offers critiques of sub-reviewable pop-culture detritus.
Rabin released his memoir in 2009, "The Big Rewind: A Memoir Brought To You By Pop Culture," (2009, ISBN 978-1-4165-5620-6) which was published by Scribner. "The Washington Post" gave the book a negative review, calling it a "...failed project is brought to you by pop culture." while "The New York Times" wrote, "has packed [The Big Rewind like a cannon, full of caustic wit and bruised feelings" in its more positive review. The book uses novels such as "The Great Gatsby", musical recordings such as "The Charm of the Highway Strip" by The Magnetic Fields and other pop culture items as a springboard to discuss its author's tragi-comic adolescence as a guest of a mental hospital, a foster family whose patience and generosity he jokes "knew only strict, unyielding boundaries" and the Jewish Children's Bureau group home system as well as his career with "The A.V. Club" and the short-lived film review show "Movie Club With John Ridley" which he appeared on. The book ends with a chapter about Rabin's unsuccessful audition to fill in for Roger Ebert as a guest critic on "At the Movies." Scribner also published a book version of "My Year of Flops" (2010, ISBN 1-4391-5312-4).
On April 23, 2013, The AV Club announced that Rabin, Tasha Robinson, Genievive Koski, and Noel Murray would be leaving to start a new web-based project with former staffers Scott Tobias and Keith Phipps. On May 30, 2013, this project was revealed to be The Dissolve.
Rabin is Jewish.

Marguerite Abouet

Marguerite Abouet is an Ivoirian writer of bandes dessinées. She was born in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire in 1971. She is best known for her graphic novel series "Aya".
Biography.
At the age of twelve, Abouet and her brother moved to France with their great uncle. She currently resides in Romainville, a suburb just outside of Paris, with her husband, illustrator Clément Oubrerie (who illustrates her graphic concepts), and their young son. She worked as a legal assistant in Paris while she wrote her first graphic novel, "Aya". Before writing "Aya", Abouet tried to write novels for young people, but she gave up in frustration with what she perceived to be the constraints put on the genre by the publishers. She has also quit her job as a legal assistant to concentrate on writing full-time, including her two follow up graphic novels to "Aya" ("Aya of Yop City" and "Aya: The Secrets Come Out").
Aya.
"Aya" is Abouet's first published work. It is also her first venture into graphic novels, as well as a collaborative effort with her husband who used "Aya" as his first illustrating job in graphic novels. She was influenced to do a graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi, the author of "Persepolis". It also emerged from her desire to show an Africa with a focus on issues other than war and famine, which is typically what the media focus on in portraying Africa. Her characters go to school, trudge off to work, plan for the future and allow themselves to be ensnared in domestic entanglements on the Ivory Coast the same way they do everywhere else. 
Abouet denies that "Aya" is autobiographical, except in the sense that it is the Ivory Coast that she is familiar with. The characters are based on people she knew growing up, but the situations are purely fictional.
"Aya" has been considered a success especially for a first-time author. It won the 2006 Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for First Comic Book and has sold over 200,000 copies in France. The Canadian publisher Drawn and Quarterly distributed the English-language version in the United States. They have printed over 10,000 copies in the U.S., which is a significant number for a first time graphic novel in the United States. Abouet persuaded her French publisher to sell cheaper, soft-cover copies of the graphic novel in her native Ivory Coast.
Volume lists.
The story is being adapted into an animated film to be released in 2011.

Pecking Order (game)

Pecking Order is a card game, where players try to claim the best feeding spots in the jungle by playing their birds on the perches and determining who is stronger. It was published by Winning Moves Games USA in 2006 as the first game in its Immortal Eyes line.
Gameplay.
The game is typically played over a number of rounds, decided in advance by the players. Players start the game by placing the board between them showing all the perches. Each player shuffles a set of cards (birds featuring the numbers 1-12 and a Jaguar) to create their deck. On a player's turn, they draw a card and place it on one of the perches face-down. If the opposing player already has a card on that perch, a battle occurs, with the player playing the card being of aggressor. The defender flips over their card and the result is determined by the aggressor (who's card is still face down:
1) If both played birds, the player with the higher numbered bird wins.
2) If either played the Jaguar, that player who played it wins unless both players played jaguars, in which case there is a tie.
3) If it is a tie, the player controlling the 1 point (Tie-breaker) perch is the winner.
If neither player controls the tie-breaker perch, then the tie goes to the aggressor. The losing card is removed, along with any jaguars. There are certain perches that allow for special abilities or extra points. The 1 point perch is a Tie-breaker perch, allowing the controlling player to win ties. The 3 point perch is the Vision Roof and it allows a player who wins the perch to look at a face down card of an opponent. The 8 point perch is special, in that it is made up of two perches. If a single player controls both of the perches, he gains an additional 3 points (for a total of 19). The game ends when each player has played through their deck. Player tally their scores, and gain points for perches they control with birds. However, a perch controlled with a jaguar does not gain the player points. The player with the most points wins the round.

Hurt Building

The Hurt Building is a 17-story building at 50 Hurt Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia. Built between 1913 and 1926, the bulk of the building was completed in 1913, with a courtyard, entry rotunda and a wing extending final completion to 1926. It was built by Joel Hurt, an Atlanta developer to a design by the New York architectural firm of J.E.R. Carpenter. The Hurt Building is a flatiron building, occupying a triangular site, with the rotunda at the apex. With restrained ornamentation, it occupies a middle ground between Beaux Arts classicism and the emerging modernist aesthetic.
One of the nation’s earliest skyscrapers, the first tenant occupied the Hurt Building in October 1913. Standing 18 floors in height and said to be the 17th largest office building in the world at the time of its construction, it is considered a good example of the skyscraper developed by Louis Sullivan and The Chicago School. World War I delayed construction of the building’s north and south wings and light well until 1924. Six decades later, beginning in 1983, The Hurt Building was completely renovated, inside and out, reopening in 1985.
The Hurt Building's lower 4-floors were designed to envelope the maximum allowable building site, except the western building apex, which was constructed 30-feet back in order to enhance window area and promote the majestic view of Atlanta’s burgeoning city. The upper 13-floors of the building, configured in a “V” are appointed by an open light well, accentuated by elevated garden areas. The building is constructed of steel frame and reinforced concrete. The building envelope is uninterrupted marble and glazed brick piers with ornamental terra cotta spandrels terminating in a heavy decorative cornice exemplifying the craftsmanship of the early 1900s.
The Hurt Building is notable for its three-story domed rotunda. The original 1913 chandelier underscores the artistically vibrant ceiling, decorated with brilliant gold leaf panels and dramatic sunbursts, reflected in the circular grand marble staircase leading to the City Grill.
The NBC legal drama Matlock, starring Andy Griffith, used exterior shots of the Hurt Building to represent the office of the fictional Ben Matlock.
The Hurt Building at 96 years old became the first commercial office building in the state of Georgia (and 6th oldest in the nation) to earn LEED-EBOM Gold Certification as well as the first in Georgia to be awarded the BOMA 360 designation, both in 2009.

Manych Ship Canal

The Manych Ship Canal is a canal system between the basins of the Sea of Azov, Black Sea, and Caspian Sea. Proposals are being considered to expand the system into a larger Eurasia Canal system. The canal would be a multipurpose water-resources system and an important part of the national transport system serving internal and international Caspian oil traffic, with huge economic potential for the region. A proposed design would enlarge the Manych Ship Canal to a depth of 6.5 m and width of 80 m with traffic capacity for more than 75 million tons per year. This proposed Eurasia Canal would allow passage of vessels with a freight-carrying capacity of up to 10,000 tons. Russia's unique geographic location and transportation infrastructure does not correspond economically to the current logistics of Russian and foreign trade.
Projections for development.
Projections for development of the freight turnover in southern Russia prepared by the Central Research Institute of Economy and Water Transport Exploitation show a steady growth trend of foreign-trade freight traffic, including water transport. The Volga-Don Ship Canal, constructed in the 1950s, is obsolescent and approaching its traffic capacity limit of 14.8 million tons. The Manych Ship Canal is one of several variants of water transport connection being considered between the basins of Azov-Black and Caspian Seas to improve the transport performance in the Caspian region, including southern Russia.
The 700 km-long Manych Ship Canal includes the existing Manych Waterway through Lake Manych-Gudilo and the Veselovskoe and Proletarskoe reservoirs, and could be extended to the Caspian Sea via the sparsely populated steppes of Kalmykia. The watershed divide between the Azov and Caspian seas has a western slope elevation of 27 m and an eastern slope elevation of 54 m. The Gidroexpertiza expert center of hydraulic facilities safety estimates this divide can be surmounted by construction of three or four shipping locks of low pressure on the western slope, and three average pressure or six low pressure shipping locks on the eastern slope. Construction of six low pressure shipping locks on the eastern slope of the watershed could significantly reduce the volume of earthwork and lower fresh water requirements by a third, to approximately 1.5 cubic km.
There are several possible methods by which to supply the Manych Ship Canal with water, which could include:
The first and the second methods would restore to the Sea of Azov the volume of fresh water diverted to the Don River via locks on the Volga slope of the Volga-Don Shipping Canal.
History.
20th century.
The West Manych River originally consisted of 15 small lakes connected by narrow streams. Manych spring flooding quickly evaporated because the geological structure of the Manych depression resembles a plain of “plates” and hollows with depths typically not more than 2 m. The river course became flat cracked saline land though the summer, with some areas sparkling with the whiteness of salt.
A canal connecting the Black and Caspian Seas was approved in May 1932, and construction began that year in the West Manych River valley. The shipping route was divided into three sections by the construction plan of 1936. The first section from the Don River to Chograi Dam, with a length of 448 km, was planned as a number of reservoir storage reaches. The second section was projected as a canal with a depth of 3 m, width of 67 m, and length of 73 km from Chograi Dam to the Kuma River. The third section, with a length of 150 km, was intended as a free-flow navigable and irrigational canal to a port on the Caspian coast.
The 62 km-long Ust-Manych reservoir, the 100 km-long Veselovskoe reservoir, and the 150 km-long Proletarskoe reservoir were formed in 1941 by the 4,7 km-long earthen Poiree dam near Veseliy hamlet and weir near stanitsa Proletarskaya. A 329 km-long locked waterway was created by the connection of Manych-Gudilo lake to Proletarskoe reservoir. The 48,8 km-long Chogray Reservoir was constructed from 1969 to 1973 on the East Manych River. 
Construction of the Manych Ship Canal was suspended through the Great Patriotic war. Hydraulic works of the suspended shipping canal were reconstructed after the war, but construction of a connection with the Volga-Don Shipping Canal was cancelled because of the lack of freight flow at that time. 
Economic use of the Manych steppes improved through the second half of the 20th century. The Nevinnomyssky canal was completed in 1948, and water from the Kuban River began to flow to reservoirs of Manych. The water level of Proletarskoe reservoir reached the altitude mark of -11,9 m and Manych-Gudilo lake became full-flowing by the summer of 1954. Salinity of the water system rapidly decreased and lakes became filled, with many of them forming one connected system. Water supply canals and filling the Manych with water created new wading bird habitats. Biodiversity of fish fauna was considerably increased over the first 15 or 20 years following construction of the tandem reservoir system, and some species gained importance as a fishery. Increasing salinity decreased fish yields in Proletarskoe reservoir, and fishing is possible only in mouths of rivers entering reservoirs. Biodiversity of fish fauna and its productivity might be improved by construction of the canal to supply Mancy-Gudilo Lake with fresh water to reduce salinity.
21st century.
The Volga-Don Shipping Canal no longer meets the present needs of carriers of countries of the Caspian region, and the completion of construction of the Manych Ship Canal would favour further growth of cargo traffic between the Caspian and Azov-Black Sea basins. Economic development of southern Russia requires completion of the canal. Construction of additional processing capacity for oil and gas fields on the Russian Caspian territory would produce 15 million tons of cargo per year by 2020. Processed oil products would reach 25 million tons annually if Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan processing capacities expand as planned. That amount could be carried to Western Europe by waterways rather than by railway. Oil from the Caspian shelf oilfield could be directly transported by tankers to processing capacities of Lukoil and KazMunayGas on the Black Sea shore without trans-shipments.
Modernization of the existing Volga-Don navigation canal can meet only the requirements of Russian companies. In the absence of improved Russian transportation routes by 2020, alternative transport corridors may be constructed through Azerbaijan to the Georgian seaports in the Black Sea or through Iran to the Persian Gulf.
The Manych Ship Canal could be a Russian route satisfying all requirements of the economically developing Caspian countries. Russia may be unable to provide competitive cargo tariffs without the Manych Ship Canal, and may lose a considerable part of profits from the transit of cargo of expanding economies in the Caspian region. Construction of the Canal can become a key factor of formation of industrial clusters adjacent to the shipping route within the republics of Kalmykia and Dagestan, the territories of Stavropol and Krasnodar Krai, and the Rostov and Astrakhan regions of southern Russia. Construction of the Manych Ship Canal would link the Caspian and Azov Seas and provide an outlet to world oceans for southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and northern Iran. The canal would be an important factor for the development of the whole Southern Federal District.
Benefits.
Fresh water from the canal could increase yields of agriculture and husbandry in arid areas. Hydroelectric-pumped storage power plants could be constructed at the base of facilities of the canal. Such power plants could significantly increase operating benefits of wind-driven power plants planned to be constructed in the Republic of Kalmykia and the Stavropol Territory. Canal facilities could include water reservoirs up-slope of the canal for a pumped-storage hydroelectricity power generation scheme in times of peak level usage or zero-wind conditions.
Sixty MW of electric power will be required to provide a water supply for each lock. Power can be provided by construction of 30 wind-electric sets with an output of three MW each. This would require 10 sets near each lock on the eastern slope of the Canal. Energy may be recovered while filling and draining the locks. Construction of the Manych Ship Canal can become a comprehensive approach to the development of arid areas possibly minimizing negative environmental consequences of earlier projects in the Manych-Chograi ecosystem.
The project would shorten delivery time and reduce transport expenses to improve the competitive position of the Russian transportation network. Construction and maintenance of the canal would promote further development of the regional productive forces by establishing new enterprises and workplaces to reduce social tension and increase tax revenues in regions with a high unemployment rate.
Positive consequences.
Positive consequences of implementation of the project would include:
Completion of construction of Manych Ship Canal would lead to emergence of manufacturing activities, a significant decrease of unemployment rate, normalization of migration, an increase of incomes, and improvement of the general well-being of the population.
Fresh water from the canal would potentially increase productivity of agriculture and husbandry. Desalinization of strongly saline water bodies along the canal route may significantly improve qualitative composition and yields of fishery.
Employment benefits.
A lack of employment leads to the drift of the population away from the region, while a narrow range of choice of needed professions, as a rule, limited to agriculture and husbandry, brings highly skilled specialists, among them graduates of the best colleges or universities of Russia, to look for a job away from home. The present rates of birth and natality of Southern Russia, the highest in the Russian Federation, may suggest future aggravation of the problem of employment if the present situation does not change.
Completion of construction of the canal would lead to the emergence of a considerable quantity of new jobs in production, formed by the influence of operation of the canal (oil processing and refining, chemical industry, and other export-oriented productions) and in the process of construction and operation of the navigational route directly. Creation of new jobs in the productive industry may lead to an increase in the number of employees in the service industries.
A ship canal allows shipment of a wider variety of cargo than pipeline systems limited to products of the hydrocarbon process industry. The ship canal would become an important factor in the development of the manufacturing industry of the republics of Kalmykia and Dagestan, Stavropol and Krasnodarskiy Territories, Rostov, and Astrakhan Regions. Oil and gas processing, chemical industry and other export-oriented productions could receive a high-power development impulse.
A decrease in the unemployment rate would be one important result of construction of the Manych Ship Canal. The Southern Federal District is the most problematic region of Russia with regard to the employment rate, one of the causes of a growth in social tensions.
Environmental concerns.
Transporting oil and oil products by tankers with a capacity of 5,000 tons along the Manych Ship Canal and Volga-Don Waterway could lead to potentially large petroleum spills. Such spills would be difficult to localize and could negatively influence the unique natural features of the Volga-Akhtuba inter-river area if transported by strong currents along the navigation channel into numerous shoals and ducts. A shipwreck of a tanker spilling 5,000 tons of oil near Volgograd could damage the whole lower part of the Volga, including protected areas and nature reserves. The same might happen to the lower part of the Don. Such a shipwreck on the Manych Ship Canal might restrict the extent pollution between shipping locks. Locks could control flow velocity to reduce the speed of spreading oil, and contain an oil spill for removal and cleanup.
The water level of the Caspian Sea has varied within 4 m over a period of 30 years. Water levels in the Caspian Sea down to true altitude of -29 m reduce the depth of the lower Volga and restrict ship movement in this part of the Volga-Don Waterway. A shipping lock in the Manych Ship Canal near the Caspian Sea could be designed to control this water level fluctuation.
Construction of a canal in the arid zone should be preceded by fundamental studies of prospective consequences of the designed engineering and construction works for the environment. Implementation of the project is connected with considerable earth excavation when laying the canal track.
The actual environmental impact statement can be presented on design stage only. Minimization of the negative ecological impact can be provided only if separate design companies and experts coordinate their technical decisions. Some scientists also make assumptions that the salt waters of the Azov Sea can fall into the canal.
According to the project concept, the watershed point is in the Chograi reservoir. Fresh waters along the western slope (27 m) go down to the Don and along the eastern slope (54 m) to the Caspian Sea. The entire canal track would be filled with fresh water.
The engineering and construction measures and implementation of the project in general could extenuate the existing negative processes in the Manych-Chograi ecosystem. To foresee all the aspects of environmental safety in the arid zone of the South of Russia, basic research on prognostics and modeling of climatic volatility is required.
This assessment is preliminary and must become more concrete after conducting proper comprehensive ecological and engineer researches of the area through which the canal track will be laid, after the planned engineering solution and the operating regime of the Canal.
Feasibility studies.
Scientific and technical feasibility studies of new water and land routes are relevant for densely populated southern Russia. Construction proposals for a navigation canal should be thoroughly studied to minimize environmentally negative consequences. 
Risk factors include:
Constructing the canal invert and banks with concrete or similar materials could diminish shoreline erosion and decrease underflooding and soil salinization from percolating water losses.
There would be no direct waterway between the Azov and Caspian seas, for the watershed divide is on the level of the Chograi reservoir. Technical procedures for control and sterilization of ballast water will diminish the danger of transfer of foreign fauna over the watershed divide.
The over-mineralized endorheic basins of the Kuma-Manych depression created soil salinization and the appearance of unusable agricultural areas. An inflow of water with less mineralization may partially flush salinity from soils at higher elevations.
Strict observance of existing regulations for tanker oil transportation will be required. Waterworks installations should be designed to facilitate localization of oil patches and other types of surface pollution and removal of its consequences. Five hundred of the designed 700 km canal track pass through existing reservoirs requiring deepening of the canal invert.
Minimization of the environmentally negative impact can be provided only if separate design companies and environment experts coordinate their technical decisions and strictly observe the technical regulations and norms. Implementation of the project on construction of the navigation canal "Eurasia" is feasible and should not have environmentally negative consequences.

Alexander 'Alex' Bone (born 26 December 1971 in Stirling) is a Scottish footballer who plays as a forward. Bone began his career with St Mirren before moving to Stirling Albion in the mid-1990s. Bone went on to score more than a goal every two games for the Albion before winning an £80,000 move to Ayr United in 1999. Despite scoring on his début for Ayr, Bone spent the final few months of the season on loan, spending time back at Stirling and then latterly at Ross County. Such was his impact at County – he scored in the final four matches of the season – that he moved there on a permanent deal for the start of the next season. Months into his permanent spell, Bone received a five-match ban for accumulating three red cards in a match. Bone stayed at Victoria Park until early 2003 when he moved to Peterhead on a short-term deal, before spending just over a year with Elgin City. Shortly into the 2004-05 season, Bone joined Clachnacuddin, spending three years with "The Lilywhites". In the summer of 2007, Bone moved on to Forres Mechanics, where he remains today.
In a 2004 poll by the BBC, Bone came third in a vote to find Stirling's all-time hero.
Bone is the nephew of former Scotland player Jimmy Bone.

The Wicker Man (film series)

The Wicker Man is a series of three horror films (the third of which remains unproduced) created by British author and director Robin Hardy. Hardy announced plans for the trilogy in a 2007 interview with "The Guardian" newspaper, though the first film in the trilogy, "The Wicker Man", was originally made 34 years before, in 1973. 
The films are not directly linked to one another, but all deal with the theme of paganism in the modern world. The first two films feature Christopher Lee.
The 2006 American remake of "The Wicker Man" is not a part of the series, and Hardy has dissociated himself from it.
Films.
"The Wicker Man" (1973).
"The Wicker Man" was released in 1973. The film was directed by Robin Hardy and written by Anthony Shaffer, who based his screenplay loosely on the David Pinner novel "Ritual".
The story follows a Scottish police officer, Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward), who visits the isolated island of Summerisle in the search for a missing girl named Rowan Morrison. The inhabitants of Summerisle all follow a form of Celtic paganism, which shocks and appalls the devoutly Christian sergeant. Howie discovers that the pagans, led by their laird, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), are planning a human sacrifice in the hopes that it will appease the gods and restore their crops. Believing that Rowan Morrison will be sacrificed, Howie strives to rescue her, only to discover that her supposed disappearance was just a ploy to lure him to the island. The pagans imprison Howie in a wicker man and set it ablaze, burning him to death.
"The Wicker Man" is generally very highly regarded by critics. Film magazine "Cinefantastique" described it as "The "Citizen Kane" of Horror Movies", and in 2004 the magazine "Total Film" named "The Wicker Man" the sixth greatest British film of all time. It also won the 1978 Saturn Award for Best Horror Film. A scene from this film was #45 on Bravo's "100 Scariest Movie Moments".
"The Wicker Tree" (2011).
In 2006, Robin Hardy published a follow-up novel to "The Wicker Man" storyline entitled "Cowboys for Christ". It follows two young Americans, Beth and Steve, who leave Texas to spread Christianity in Tressock, Scotland. They are welcomed by Sir Lachlan Morrison and his wife, Delia Morrison; unbeknown to Beth and Steve, they are in grave danger from a Celtic pagan community in the village.
A film adaptation, entitled "The Wicker Tree", was produced in 2009, with Hardy directing from his own screenplay. It had a film festival showing in 2011. A limited theatrical release occurred in January 2012 in the U.S., followed by a DVD release in April 2012.
"The Wrath of the Gods" (2015).
"The Wrath of the Gods" is an upcoming romantic black comedy film written and directed by Robin Hardy, and based on "Twilight of the Gods", the final part of Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle. The film is currently in pre-production. In this film, "the gods get their comeuppance".
The film was originally intended to be set primarily in Iceland; however, Hardy decided that filming there would be too impractical, and rewrote the script, re-setting the story in Shetland, with some scenes to be shot in Los Angeles. Since Shetland has a largely Scandinavian folklore rather than Celtic, this allows the story to remain focused on Norse mythology.
Plot.
The film is divided into two parts. The main protagonists are a young couple, Siegfried and Brynne. Siegfried is handsome but "incredibly stupid", and he has been overtaken by his own hubris and sporting ability. Brynne loves him despite his flaws, and she succeeds in teaching him to make love, in a "triumphal moment". Director Robin Hardy has said that the film is ultimately about "what happens to the gods, not just to the people who are offering sacrifices to them. The gods themselves get sucked into the mêlée in the third film. I looked for a suitable carapace to put that in and the last act of the Ring cycle seems to work very well – and it allows me to mix full-blast Wagner."
Another of the film's key protagonists is Brynne's father, a chief of police. He has a tragic romance with a middle-aged woman, who has been accused of murder in Canada. Director Robin Hardy has stated that the chief of police will have to turn her in because he is an honourable man.
The main antagonist of "The Wrath of the Gods" is Mr Odin, a one-eyed Hollywood studio executive who decides to create a theme park based on the Norse sagas which originated in Iceland.
Production.
"The Wrath of the Gods" was originally intended to begin shooting in 2011, but was delayed. Filming is now expected to start as early as June or July 2012. The film will be shot on 35 mm film. Once the film's production is complete, Hardy plans for the sets to become a tourist attraction.
Brynne will be played by Icelandic actress Hatla Williams. Mr Odin will be played by James Mapes, the actor who played Reverend Moriarty in Hardy's previous film, "The Wicker Tree". Hardy has stated that he intends to cast French actress Juliette Binoche as the murder suspect.
In a Q&A session at the University of Hertfordshire, at a special screening of The Wicker Man, Robin Hardy confirmed that he intends to begin shooting in the Summer of 2013. [http://allthingswicker.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/robin-hardy-qa-at-university-of-hertfordshire-screening-of-the-wicker-man/]
In an interview with ScreenDaily, ahead of the release of 'The Wicker Man: The Final Cut', director Robin Hardy confirmed that he is currently in the opening stages of financing the third film, and hopes to make it next year (2014). [http://www.screendaily.com/news/robin-hardy-to-complete-wicker-man-trilogy/5059535.article?blocktitle=Latest-News&contentID=1846]
Soundtrack.
The film's score was written by Scottish composer Keith Easdale, and was inspired by Richard Wagner's compositions. Hardy wanted to find amusing ways to implement music in the film. Each of the characters will have their own theme: for example, Brynne will have a light melodic motif. Hardy has compared this to Leonard Bernstein work on "West Side Story", where variations on a single melody were used to create many musical themes. Hardy was also inspired by the music of Shetland's Up Helly Aa fire festivals.

Manic Pixie Dream Girl

The Manic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG) is a stock character type in films. Film critic Nathan Rabin, who coined the term after seeing Kirsten Dunst in "Elizabethtown" (2005), describes the MPDG as "that bubbly, shallow cinematic creature that exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures". MPDGs are said to help their men without pursuing their own happiness, and such characters never grow up; thus, their men never grow up.
The "Manic Pixie Dream Girl" has been compared to another stock character, the "Magical Negro", a black character who seems to exist only to provide spiritual or mystical help to the (white) protagonist. In both cases, the stock character has no discernible inner life, and usually only exists to provide the protagonist some important life lessons.
Examples.
MPDGs are usually static characters who have eccentric personality quirks and are unabashedly girlish. They invariably serve as the romantic interest for a (most often brooding or depressed) male protagonist. An example is Natalie Portman's character in the movie "Garden State", written and directed by Zach Braff.
"The A.V. Club" points to Katharine Hepburn's character in "Bringing Up Baby" (1938) as one of the earliest examples of the archetype. Later examples include Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's", Goldie Hawn's characters in "Cactus Flower" and "Butterflies Are Free", and Barbra Streisand's in "What's Up, Doc?". Zooey Deschanel's role in "500 Days of Summer" has also typified the MPDG.
The Filmspotting podcast created a list of "Top Five Manic Pixie Dream Girls"; Nathan Rabin appeared as a guest and created his own, separate list of MPDGs. Among those included were Catherine (Jeanne Moreau) in "Jules and Jim", Jean (Barbara Stanwyck) in "The Lady Eve", Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) in "Some Like It Hot", and Gerry Jeffers (Claudette Colbert) in "The Palm Beach Story". Other examples of the MPDG the media has proposed include Jean Seberg's character in "Breathless", Belle in Disney's animated "Beauty and the Beast", Maude in "Harold and Maude", and Penny Lane in "Almost Famous".
Counterexamples.
Kate Winslet's character Clementine in "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" acknowledges the trope of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl and rejects the type, in a remark to Jim Carrey's Joel: "Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind; don't assign me yours." The title character of "Annie Hall" is also not a MPDG, although often called one, as she has her own goals independent of the male lead.
Criticism and debate.
In an interview with Vulture about her film "Ruby Sparks", actress and screenwriter Zoe Kazan criticized the term as reductive, diminutive, and misogynistic. She disagreed that Hepburn's character in "Bringing Up Baby" is a MPDG: "I think that to lump together all individual, original quirky women under that rubric is to erase all difference."
In a December 2012 video, AllMovie critic Cammila Collar embraced the term as an effective description of one-dimensional female characters who only seek the happiness of the male protagonist, and who do not deal with any complex issues of their own. The pejorative use of the term, then, is mainly directed at writers who do not give these female characters more to do than bolster the spirits of their male partners.

Sermersooq (, "Place of Much Ice") is a new municipality in Greenland, operational from 1 January 2009. It is home to Nuuk (formerly called Godthåb), the capital of Greenland, and is the most populous municipality in the country, with 21,868 inhabitants as of January 2013. The municipality consists of former municipalities of eastern and southwestern Greenland, each named after the largest settlement at the time of formation:
Geography.
The municipality is located in south-central and eastern Greenland, with the area of . It is the second largest municipality in the world by area, after Qaasuitsup. In the south, it is flanked by the Kujalleq municipality, with the border running alongside Alanngorsuaq Fjord. The waters flowing around the western coastline of the municipality are that of Labrador Sea, which to the north narrows down to form Davis Strait separating the island of Greenland from Baffin Island. 
In the northwest, the municipality is bordered by the Qeqqata municipality, and further north by the Qaasuitsup municipality. The latter border however runs north-south through the center (45° West meridian) of the Greenland ice sheet () − and as such is free of traffic. In the north the municipality is bordered by the Northeast Greenland National Park. In the east, near the settlement of Ittoqqortoormiit, the municipal shores straddle the Kangertittivaq fjord, which empties into the cold Greenland Sea. The southeastern shores are bordered by the waters of the Denmark Strait, which separates the island of Greenland from Iceland.
Transport.
Sermersooq is one of two municipalities straddling the western and eastern sides of the island, but is the only municipality where settlements on both coasts are connected via scheduled flights between Nuuk Airport and Kulusuk Airport operated year-round by Air Greenland.
Language.
"Kalaallisut", the West Greenlandic dialect is spoken in the towns and settlements of the western coast. Danish is also in use in the bigger towns. Tunumiit oraasiat, the East Greenlandic dialect, is spoken on the eastern coast.

Longford Hall, Derbyshire

Longford Hall is a 16th-century country house at Longford in Derbyshire. It is a Grade II* listed building
The Manor was built in the 16th century for the de Longford family. On the demise of the last of the de Longfords about 1620 the manor passed to Sarah Reddish who married Clement Coke, younger son of Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chief Justice of Holkham Hall, Norfolk. Their son Edward was created a baronet in 1641 ( see Coke baronets) and was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1646.
In 1727, with the extinction of the line descended from Clement Coke, the estate passed to the senior Coke line, the Cokes of Holkham Hall, and was inherited by Robert Coke, son of Sir Edward Coke and Cary Newton. When Robert Coke died in 1750, his nephew Wenman Roberts, son of Philip Roberts and Anne Coke (Robert's older sister), inherited Longford Hall. Under the will of Sir Edward Coke, third and last Baronet, Roberts assumed the surname and arms of Coke in order to inherit Longford Hall. In 1775, Wenman Coke also inherited Holkham Hall. 
The house was much altered in about 1762 by architect Joseph Pickford to a H-plan; two substantial three-storeyed, fifteen-bayed balustraded wings linked by a single-storey central block.
In 1776, at the death of Wenman Coke, his eldest son Thomas William Coke (created Earl of Leicester in 1837) inherited Holkham Hall and Longford Hall passed to his younger son, Edward Coke. At the death of Edward Coke in 1837, Longford Hall passed to Thomas William Coke, who visited it the same year and found it in a shocking state of disrepair. Coke wrote orders to the bailiff to do all that was necessary to make it habitable. The bailiff, mistakenly believing that the stonework was unsafe, pulled down the tower and the old banqueting hall which contained the carved gallery and stained glass windows bearing the arms of the Longford family from the time of the Conquest. During the last five years of his life, Coke visited Longford annually and returned the estate to its former splendor. In June 1842, Coke, sensing that he was in his last days, decided to pay his boyhood home one last visit. Shortly after his arrival, after dedicating two new bridges he had built over a mill stream that ran through the village, he took seriously ill and died on 30 June 1842, aged 88 years. 
A fire destroyed the central cross block and much of the upper storeys. It was restored in 1960 but the upper storey is now only a facade.

New York Times Building (41 Park Row)

41 Park Row, often called the New York Times Building, in the Civic Center neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, was the home of "The New York Times" from 1889 to 1903, when it moved to Longacre Square, now known as Times Square. The building stands as the oldest of the surviving buildings of what was once "Newspaper Row", and is owned by Pace University. A bronze statue of Benjamin Franklin holding a copy of his "Pennsylvania Gazette" stands in front of the building in Printing-House Square, currently known as 1 Pace Plaza.
History.
The newspaper's first building was located at 113 Nassau Street in New York City. In 1854, it moved to 138 Nassau Street, and in 1858 it moved to a five-story building designed by Thomas R. Jackson in the Romanesque Revival style at 41 Park Row, making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use. The original building constructed for the "Times" was a five-story structure in the Romanesque revival style, designed by Thomas R. Jackson, that occupied the site of the Brick Presbyterian Church. The 1851 building, located across from City Hall and dwarfing that of Horace Greeley's "New York Tribune", was described by the "Times" in 2001 as "a declaration that the newspaper regarded itself as a powerful institution in civic life... No politician standing on the broad steps of City Hall could fail to note the newspaper's presence. And after 1871, when The Times led the crusade against the Tweed Ring, no politician could afford to ignore it."
After Greeley's "Tribune" raised the stakes with a taller building of its own in the 1870s, the Times responded in 1889 with a commission for architect George B. Post to design a grander — and taller — building at 41 Park Row to replace the existing structure. The 13-story Romanesque building, with arches carved from Maine granite and Indiana limestone, was constructed around the core of the original building. The printing presses were kept in place, and the new building constructed around it as the old one was demolished – this space was later used by Pace University as a gym. The top floor was designated for use by the composing room to allow the printers access to more natural light. 
The paper was purchased by Adolph Ochs in 1896. Under Ochs' leadership, architect Robert Maynicke was retained to remove the original mansard roof and add three additional stories of offices.
The building was purchased by Pace University in 1951, and has been used for classrooms and offices. 41 Park Row was designated a New York City landmark in 1999.

Cookie (novel)

Cookie is a children's novel written by prolific author Jacqueline Wilson, published in October 2008 by Doubleday. It is illustrated, as are most of her books, by Nick Sharratt. The book was released on 9 October 2008.
The book was age-banded (as "9+") by the publisher, despite Wilson's opposition to the practice.
Plot.
Despite her name, Beauty Cookson is a plain, timid girl who is called Ugly by other girls at school, especially a mean girl called Skye. Worse than the teasing in the playground, though, is the unpredictable criticism from her father. She is frequently berated for breaking any of his fussy house rules, as well as for her lack of looks, confidence and friends, even though she lives in a large house and attends a private school. Beauty adores rabbits, although her father forbids her to have pets. Her favourite television show is "Rabbit Hutch", a show for young children about a man and his pet rabbit.
She has no friends at all at school. The only girl that is nice to her is Rhona, Skye's best friend. However, Rhona desperately wants to be friends with Beauty, which she reveals one day when Skye is at a dentist appointment. There is also another reasonably nice person at Beauty's school: Beauty's class teacher, Miss Woodhead. Finally, she is invited by Rhona to a birthday party she is holding. For the birthday party, Beauty's dad forces her to get corkscrew curls and Skye, Arabella and Emily (bullies) develop a new nickname for her: Ugly Corkscrew.
Beauty tells her mum, Dilys "Dilly" Cookson (who is a beautiful young woman) about the teasing and her mum decides to learn how to bake cookies, even though she is an awful cook, in the hope that Beauty will be given a new nickname, Cookie (a play on her surname, Cookson). Gradually, both Beauty and her mum get the hang of making cookies and become wonderous at it. Beauty's birthday is approaching and she is dreading it, however her father appears to turn a new leaf and act like a real dad. Her dad organises tickets for all of the girls in her class to see a stage show called 'Birthday Bonanza', with a chauffeur driven limousine to escort them there. Beauty invites all the girls, including Skye, and decides to give out cookies at the end of the party. The birthday starts to become unbearable when, at the show, Beauty is too shy to go onstage (the show is to celebrate people's birthdays), and he shouts at her in the limousine as well as ruining her cookies. Despite her humiliation, Beauty is determined to be called Cookie. 
However, when Dilly and Beauty learn that her father let the rabbit Rhona gave Beauty for her birthday out of its cage (and killed by a fox), Dilly decides she has had enough of her husband, tells him she is separating from him and goes away in her car taking Beauty with her. First of all, they go to the first Mrs. Cookson (Avril) who is very nice. She lets them stay for the night until they decide to go on holiday. The holiday resort they choose is called Rabbit Cove, Beauty chooses it due to her craze over rabbits. They find themselves in an idyllic seaside resort run by a man named Mike, who takes Dilly on as a breakfast chef.
Dilly decides to let her husband know where they are, despite Beauty's objections, but after he shouts at her and calls her a "useless aging dumb blonde" she terminates the call. He tracks them down, and yells at them in front of the customers at the cafe, even going as far as to accuse her of having an affair with Mike and punching him in the nose, before driving off. Even though Dilly is living with Mike and he hints that he wants to start dating, Dilly refuses for the time being, as she wants to be independent. He understands, as he is a kind calm, serene and understanding person.
Just before summer, Beauty is sent to a new school where she makes friends, and she still keeps in touch with Rhona by writing letters. Beauty is asked to go on 'Watchbox', a talent show that Skye really wanted to be on, due to the rise in popularity of her mother's cookies. As a treat, the producers of Watchbox invite Sam and Lily, who tells Beauty that Lily is pregnant with her own baby rabbits. Sam decides to give Beauty (now nicknamed Cookie at her new school) her own baby rabbit.
Audiobook.
A BBC audiobook was released in the same month as the novel, read by Finty Williams.

<doc id="19717354" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19717354" title="Acid test (gold)">
Acid test (gold)

An acid test is any qualitative chemical or metallurgical assay which uses acid; most commonly, and historically, the use of a strong acid to distinguish gold from base metals. Figuratively, acid test is any definitive test for some attribute, e.g. of a person's character, or of the performance of some product.
Chemistry.
Testing for gold with acid focuses around the fact that gold is a noble metal which is resistant to change by corrosion, oxidation or acid. The acid test for gold is to rub the gold-colored item on black stone, which will leave an easily visible mark. The mark is tested by applying aqua fortis (nitric acid), which dissolves the mark of any item that is not gold. If the mark remains, it is tested by applying aqua regia (nitric acid and hydrochloric acid). If the mark is removed, then this test dissolved the gold, proving the item to be genuine gold. More accurate testing of the item for its fineness or purity can be done through the use of differencing strengths of aqua regia and comparative testing of gold items of known fineness.
Figurative meanings.
The figurative meaning of the expression, where it is applied to tests of character, or definitive tests to other materials, became popular during and after the California Gold Rush, but was current before then, as shown by this quote from the Wisconsin paper "The Columbia Reporter", November 1845: "Twenty-four years of service demonstrates his ability "to stand the acid test", as Gibson’s Soap Polish has done for over thirty years."
Other examples of the figurative use of the phrase are the web sites Acid1, Acid2 and Acid3, which are designed to test web browsers for compliance with current web standards. Another example is the quick ratio method, nicknamed "acid test", used by financial analysts to assess the liquidity of a business.
The use of the term "acid test" for experiences with the psychedelic drug LSD was popularised by the Merry Pranksters, and derives from the drug's common name, "acid". Many users experience a dissolution between themselves and the "outside world".

They narrowly missed out on returning to the top division in 1989-90, when they finished third, level on points with second-placed Hapoel Tel Aviv, but with a goal difference which was two worse. The following season they were promoted, but were relegated at the end of the 1991-92 season, having finished second from bottom.
After a narrow escape in the 1996-97 season (in which they finished one place and one point above the relegation zone), Maccabi were relegated to Liga Alef (then the third tier) at the end of the 1997-98 season, in which they won only one match and gained eight points all season. Due to league restructuring, at the end of the following season they dropped into the fourth tier.
In 2000-01 Maccabi won the South Division of Liga Alef and were promoted back to Liga Artzit. However, they finished bottom of the league in 2001-02 and were relegated back to Liga Alef. In 2011–12 Maccabi beat Hapoel Asi Gilboa in the promotion playoff final and were promoted to Liga Leumit.

The Hermes libraries are available for download under the GNU Lesser General Licence Terms as a means of providing open-source software for the development of Computational Scientific Research. Hermes implementation of adaptive hp-FEM for improved convergence and accuracy in non-linear systems is featured in the software. The software and underlying numerical methods are developed by an international
hp-FEM group at
the University of Nevada at Reno (USA) and Institute of Thermomechanics in
Prague (Czech Republic). Hermes is based on space- and space-time adaptive multi-mesh hp-FEM algorithms working with highly irregular meshes. The mesh generation is designed using arbitrary-level hanging nodes.
Documentation.
The Documentation for the Hermes libraries is an extensive set of instructions, information and tutorials related to the use of Hermes and the Finite Element Method. Hermes includes instructions for the installation of collaborating Third Party Libraries (TPLs) as well as an introduction to the mathematics behind the hp-FEM method and detailed instructions on the use and modification of the code. Any user who wished to add to the capabilities of Hermes can find instructions on how to submit their work directly to the authors via GitHub.

Testicular sarcoidosis

Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown aetiology that results in the formation of non-caseating granulomas in multiple organs. The prevalence is higher among blacks than whites by a ratio of 20:1. Usually the disease is localized to the chest, but urogenital involvement is found in 0.2% of clinically diagnosed cases and 5% of those diagnosed at necropsy. The kidney is the most frequently affected urogenital organ, followed in men by the epididymis. Testicular sarcoidosis can present as a diffuse painless scrotal mass or can mimic acute epididymo-orchitis. Usually it appears with systemic manifestations of the disease. Since it causes occlusion and fibrosis of the ductus epididymis, fertility may be affected. Opinions differ on the need for histological proof, with reports of limited biopsy and frozen section, radical orchiectomy in unilateral disease and unilateral orchiectomy in bilateral disease. The peak incidence of sarcoidosis and testicular neoplasia coincide at 20–40 years and this is why most patients end up having an orchiectomy. However, testicular tumours are much more common in white men, less than 3.5% of all testicular tumours being found in black men. These racial variations justify a more conservative approach in patients of Afro-Caribbean descent with proven sarcoidosis elsewhere. Careful follow-up and ultrasonic surveillance may be preferable in certain clinical settings to biopsy and surgery, especially in patients with bilateral testicular disease.

1968 PGA Championship

The 1968 PGA Championship was the 50th PGA Championship played July 18–21 at Pecan Valley Golf Club in San Antonio, Texas. Julius Boros, age 48, won the third of his three major titles, one stroke ahead of runners-up Bob Charles and Arnold Palmer. Through 2013, Boros remains the oldest winner of a major championship. The tournament was played in very hot conditions, and Palmer had an putt to tie on the 72nd green, but it missed on the high side of the hole. It was the second of his three runner-up finishes at the only major he never won; he also tied for second in 1964 and 1970.
This was the final major tournament before the formation of the Tournament Players Division, later renamed the PGA Tour. The tour pros broke away from the PGA of America in August and formed an independent tour, the American Professional Golfers, Inc. (APG). A compromise was reached in December which brought the tournament players back to the PGA in a separate division with its own policy board and commissioner.
In his seventh PGA Championship, Jack Nicklaus missed his first cut in the event by a stroke; five of his six finishes were in the top three, with a victory in 1963 in Dallas.
This PGA Championship was played immediately after the Open Championship in Scotland, the fifth time during the 1960s which the final two majors were played in consecutive weeks. This PGA Championship was also the last held in July; it moved permanently to August in 1969 (except 1971 in February in Florida).

Count of Ourém

Count of Ourém (in Portuguese "Conde de Ourém") is a Portuguese title granted in 1370 by King Fernando I of Portugal, to "Dom" João Afonso Telo de Meneses, uncle of Queen Leonor Telles de Menezes. Later he also became the fourth Count of Barcelos.
The title subsequently passed to João Fernandes Andeiro (a Galician noble, lover of the Queen), but when King John I of Portugal seized the throne, his Constable, Nuno Álvares Pereira, inherited it.
When the Constable's daughter married the first Duke of Braganza, "Count of Ourém" became a subsidiary title of the House of Braganza.
In 1483, Fernando II, third Duke of Bragança, was condemned for treason by order of king John II of Portugal. The House of Braganza estates were confiscated and the Condado of Ourém was granted to Pedro de Menezes, 1st Marquis of Vila Real, a great-great-grandson of João Afonso Telo de Menezes, 1st Count of Ourém.
When king Manuel I inherited the Portuguese throne, he restored the Braganzas with all their previous honours, and from then on the Condado of Ourém was included in the Braganzas’ assets.

Sherri Lightner

Sherri Schuler Lightner (born 1950) is a San Diego, California politician and community activist. She is the councilmember for San Diego City Council District 1, elected to a four-year term in November 2008 and re-elected in November 2012. She is a Democrat, although council positions are officially nonpartisan per California state law. She and her husband live in La Jolla Shores.
According to the San Diego Association of Governments,
Lightner's district has a population of 188,625 people. Council District 1 includes the communities of Carmel Valley, Del Mar Heights, the North City Future Urbanizing Area (Black Mountain Ranch, Del Mar Mesa, Pacific Highlands Ranch, and Torrey Highlands), most of La Jolla and Bird Rock, Rancho Peñasquitos, Rose Canyon, the lower San Dieguito River Valley, Sorrento Hills, Sorrento Valley, Torrey Hills, Torrey Pines, University City, and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) campus.
Life and Career.
Lightner was born in western Pennsylvania in 1950 as Sherri Ann Schuler. She moved to San Diego during elementary school and graduated from Crawford High School in San Diego. Lightner then went on to UCSD where she received her B.A. in Mathematics and Sociology and her M.S. in Applied Mechanics and Engineering. She is licensed by the State of California as a Professional Mechanical Engineer.
Lightner worked in private industry as an engineer for 23 years. She started her professional career as an Engineering Aide at General Atomics (GA), hired by the High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor Division after graduating from UCSD. Lightner later earned an M.S. degree from UCSD and worked as an engineer in the Structural Engineering Department at General Atomics for eight years, and the company's Fusion Division for another five years. She then accepted a senior engineering position with the Structural Dynamics group at Rohr Industries to work on high velocity (ballistic) impact analysis. After five years at Rohr, Lightner returned to General Atomics to work on the New Production Reactor (NPR).
After another five years at General Atomics, Lightner retired from the engineering profession and formed with her husband a small technology hardware and software consulting firm. Lightner also took up public service work, serving as a volunteer for several San Diego nonprofit organizations. She was the president of the La Jolla Town Council and La Jolla Shores Association and secretary for the La Jolla Community Planning Association.
San Diego City Council.
Lightner was one of three candidates to represent San Diego City Council District 1 in the 2008 election. Lightner led the pack in the June primary, gaining 36.5 percent of the vote compared to her Phil Thalheimer's 33.8 percent and Marshall Merrifield's 29.5 percent. Since no candidate got a majority of the votes, Lightner and Thalheimer were forced into a runoff election. During the primaries, the three candidates spent just over $1 million, a record for City Council elections: between December 31, 2007 and June 30, 2008, Lightner spent $115,298, Thalheimer spent $359,678, and Merrifield spent $653,628. These amounts do not include any independent expenditure or "member communication" money from the Republican and Democratic parties.
Lightner won the San Diego City Council general election in November with 51.9 percent of the vote, compared to Thalheimer's 48.1 percent. Lightner replaced termed-out San Diego City councilmember Scott Peters on December 8, 2008. Lightner was elected to a four-year term.
Lightner is Council President Pro Tem. She is chair of the Rules and Economic Development Committee Land Use and Housing Committee. She also serves on the Land Use and Housing Committee and the Budget and Finance Committee.
She was re-elected in the 2012 election, surviving a strong challenge from Ray Ellis, who was part of a coordinated three-person slate supported by the local Republican Party in an attempt to gain a Republican majority on the nine-member board. Lightner was forced into a November runoff where she won re-election, 55% to 45%.
As council president pro tem, Lightner is performing the duties of the council president while Council President Todd Gloria serves as interim mayor.

Yde (Adelaide) Schloenbach, later Blumenschein by marriage, (26 May 1882, São Paulo – 14 March 1963, São Paulo) was a Brazilian poet and chronicler best known as Colombina. She also used the pen name Paula Brasil.
She started writing at the age of 13, and her first poems were published in "A Tribuna", a newspaper in the city of Santos. She wrote for magazines and newspapers such as "O Malho", "Fon-Fon", "Careta" and "Jornal das Moças".
In 1948, she founded the "Casa do Poeta Lampião de Gás", a literary society that initially met in her own home. This society published a monthly newspaper, "O Fanal", of which she was the publisher.
Her poetry is centered on the theme of love, usually treated in a quite innocent way, though some of her poems have a more erotic vein that caused some scandal at her time. Her last book, "Rapsódia Rubra - Poemas à Carne" ("Red Rapsody - Poems Dedicated to Flesh"), reflects this trend, and its highly erotic poetry was particularly polemical at the time of its publishing.

151st Pennsylvania Infantry

The 151st Pennsylvania Infantry was a Union Army regiment during the American Civil War. It was given the moniker of "The Schoolteachers' Regiment" because of the large enlistment of school instructors, predominately in Company D.
History.
Forming of the Regiment.
The regiment was recruited from across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the early fall of 1862, with companies raised from the following counties:
Harrison Allen, formerly major of the 10th Pennsylvania Reserves, was elected colonel of the regiment. George F. McFarland of Company D was elected lieutenant colonel. John W. Young of Company C was elected major.
Early Service.
The regiment was moved to Washington, D.C. at the end of November, and the following month to Union Mills, Virginia, where it fell into winter quarters with the Army of the Potomac. In mid-February, the regiment was formally assigned to the Third Division of the I Army Corps as part of a replacement for the departing Pennsylvania Reserves, which was recalled to the defenses of Washington.
Chancellorsville.
The 151st's first engagement occurred at Chancellorsville, where it maintained a picket line on the mostly inactive I Corps' right flank. The regiment guarded the crucial Rapidan River crossing at United States Ford, taking prisoners on a small incursion with Brig. Gen. Francis T. Nicholls Louisiana brigade of Lt. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson's corps.
Gettysburg.
The regiment next fought at the Battle of Gettysburg, with Lt. Col. McFarland still in command. The regiment defended the Union left on McPherson's and Seminary Ridges. Confederate attacks forced the I Corps to retreat through Gettysburg. During the fighting near the Seminary, the regiment took cover near a barricade and held off several more Confederate attacks. Lt. Col. McFarland was at the front of the regiment, leading his men. The gunsmoke was so thick that McFarland couldn't see the enemy through it. He crouched down to see under the smoke and track the Confederates' movements. It was then that a Rebel bullet went through one of his legs and through the other as he crouched down. A private of Co. F attempted to carry McFarland back to the Seminary for treatment, as it was then being used as a hospital. The private nearly lost his life when a bullet came so close that it sheared off one of the brass buttons on his cuff. McFarland was kept safely inside the Seminary for several months after the battle.
The regiment reformed on Cemetery Hill with only 113 officers and men left, with a captain in command. It was assigned a position on the left of the II Corps, where on July 3, it helped repulse the Confederate attack. During the battle, the regiment lost 367 out of 478 officers and men, a rate of nearly 75%. Allen arrived that day to re-assume command of the regiment, which then participated in the pursuit of the Confederate army. Following the conclusion of the campaign, it was sent to Harrisburg on the 19th and mustered out on the 27th.
Legacy.
The 151st is held in high regard in Juniata County where Company D was formed. A plaque across the street from the old McAlisterville Academy where Lt. Col. McFarland and other members of the regiment taught memorializes the regiment and its actions at Gettysburg.
A reenacting unit from Juniata County portrays Company D of the regiment.

Society for the Advancement of Material and Process Engineering

The Society for the Advancement of Material and Process Engineering (SAMPE) is an international professional member society. SAMPE provides a global forum for information, education and professional fellowship on materials and processes development.
History.
SAMPE was formed by nine Southern California aerospace professionals concerned with the lack of materials and need to economize. They formed a network of material and process engineers to provide a means for information exchange and to prevent the duplication of effort among companies working toward a common goal.
They formed the Society of Aircraft Material and Process Engineers in 1944. It was renamed as the Society of Aerospace Material and Process Engineers in the late 1950s as a result of the developing interest in space travel. SAMPE was later renamed as the Society for the Advancement of Material and Process Engineering in 1973, to reflect membership growth beyond the aerospace industry.
Outreach.
SAMPE sponsors an annual student leadership competition for student engineers. The SAMPE Student Leader Experience Award sends eligible students to the SAMPE International Spring Symposium & Exhibition to network and increase their understanding of the Materials and Processes community.
Through its website SAMPE offers information on educational resources, employment opportunities, and a list of global chapters.

Doll Domination Tour

Doll Domination Tour was the second concert tour by American girl group The Pussycat Dolls. It was launched in support of their second studio album, "Doll Domination" (2008). Doll Domination Tour consisted of fifty two shows in 2009 in four legs with concerts in Europe, North America and in Oceania. Before heading to the Oceania shows The Pussycat Dolls supported Britney Spears in the first leg of The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009). In July the group returned to England and Ireland headlining several festivals. The set list for the concerts included songs from "PCD" (2005) and "Doll Domination" (2008) as well a cover of Shirley Bassey's Big Spender.
Background.
On August 2008, in an interview with FemaleFirst.co.uk, Ashley Roberts said that their world tour would start January 2009 adding "we're gonna be hitting everywhere around the world and taking over." The tour was officially announced on October 7, 2009. Initial dates were confirmed in the UK with Ne-Yo tapped as a support act. The following month Lady Gaga was announced as an opening act in Europe and in Oceania which marked their first time touring there, while the US shows were to be announced shortly. On December 2, 2008, Britney Spears announced the first leg of twenty-five dates in the US for The Circus Starring Britney Spears with The Pussycat Dolls as the opening act. The tour kicked off on January 18 in Aberdeen, Scotland with the first leg ending in Belgrade, Serbia. Before heading to the Oceania shows, The Pussycat Dolls supported Spears on her tour visiting 27 venues in North America. Following Oceania, they visited Asia and North America and in July they visited England and Ireland for various festivals.
Development.
The stage screens for the tour were created by Stimulated, Inc. The videos included original design and animation looks for 25 songs. The company spent two months at its Burbank studio creating the visual content for the tour. The opening video sequence of the tour was filmed at a sound stage in Hollywood, California. The group were riding motorcycles against a green screen backdrop. Then, along with The Pussycat Dolls they traveled to Leeds, United Kingdom. Along with Robb Wagner and his team, the Dolls and their creative team, worked hand-in-hand polishing the media content. The Pussycat Dolls spent six days in the Litestructures Studios for a full production rehearsal. The stage was designed by Litestructures. It marked the fourth time that the company worked with The Pussycat Dolls. It measured 32ft(w) x 24ft(deep) and 8ft(tall) - made to fit on 60ft x 44ft house stage. It featured includes three custom-built staircases which were made of small aluminium frame with a makrolon top. The set list of the shows included songs from the standard and deluxe edition of "Doll Domination" (2008) as well songs from their debut studio album, "PCD" (2005). Big Spender by Shirley Bassey was covered by Melody Thornton, as well cover versions of other artists which were used as snippets to songs. During the performances, the group was backed by five male dancers and two percussionists. During the opening leg of the tour, each show was recorded live and then loaded to The Pussycat Dolls wristband that plugs into any USB port or compatible microSD phone. According to "Metro" The Pussycat Dolls were reportedly planning to make a behind-the-scenes movie about life on their tour. According to an insider the band had started filming for the movie which was described "as part documentary and part entertainment." Despite this no official recording has been released of the concert tour.
Critical response.
While reviewing the opening concert in Aberdeen, Colene McKessick of the newspaper "The Press and Journal" described it as a "roof-raising show." The writer praised the show for its "risque dance moves and infectious energy." She also commended Nicole Scherzinger's ability to carry most of the vocals and was impressed by her bandmates describing them as "talented singers too." Sally Hind of the "Evening Express" gave a positive revire of the opening night writing "the five foxy felines didn’t once pause for breath. They were on the move from the minute they appeared on stage on shiny motorbikes until they took their final bow." She also praised the costumes of the show that "kept everyone fixated."
Barbara Hodgson of "The Journal" Her only complaint was that "they screamed too much."
Setlist.
The following set list is representative of the show on February 24, 2008. It does not represent all concerts for the duration of the tour.

Nikolai Pavlovich Glebov-Avilov (; 11 October 1887, Kaluga, - 13 March 1937) was a prominent Bolshevik.
Glebov-Avilov was the son of a cobbler who started work in a printshop in Kaluga. He became a Bolshevik in 1904, and during the 1905 Revolution, he was active in Moscow Kaluga and the Urals working in underground printshops, being hidden by the All-Russian Union of Railway Workers. Nevertheless he was subject to continual arrest. Between 1913 and 1914 he worked for Pravda (Правда). He was a participant in the February Revolution, 1917 in Tomsk and Moscow. He became the first Commissar of Potel, the People's Commissariat for Post and Telegraph until December 1918.
In the summer of 1917 he participated in the Third All Russian Conference of Trade Unions (20–28 June) in Petrograd), where he presented the Bolshevik view that:
The Conference adopted the Menshevik position by 76 votes to 63, but contained some inconsistencies: In order to prevent the unions becoming involved in the control of production, they insisted that the factory committees take overall responsibility in this area. At the same time, however, they called on the unions to make the factory committees their supports ("opornye punkty") in the various locations, and to use them as implement their policies locally.
He was arrested on 19 September 1936 on charges of participating in a counter-revolutionary terrorist organization. He was accused of being a "wrecker". He was sentenced to be shot on 12 March 1937. He was rehabilitated on 7 July 1956.

Raid on Algiers

The Raid on Algiers took place on 11 December 1942, in the Algiers harbour. Italian manned torpedoes and commando frogmen from the Decima Flottiglia MAS were brought to Algiers aboard the "Perla"-class submarine "Ambra". The participating commandos were captured after setting limpet mines which sank two Allied ships and damaged two more.
The raid.
On 4 December 1942, the Italian submarine "Ambra" of the Italian Royal Navy ("Regia Marina") left the naval base of La Spezia, carrying three manned torpedoes and 10 commando frogmen. Air recoinnassance had discovered that the port of Algiers was crowded with Allied cargo ships, thus the Italian high command had decided to launch a combined operation involving both human torpedoes and combat swimmers carrying limpet mines. On the evening of 10 December, "Ambra" reached Algiers at a depth of . One of the swimmers was employed as scout on the surface, and he guided the submarine toward a position from the southern entrance to the harbour. He spotted six steamers at 21:45, and informed the presence of targets to "Ambra" by phone. The other swimmers and the manned torpedoes begun to emerge at 23:45 after some delay. The observer reported an intense reaction from the harbour defences. The submarine awaited to recover the operators until 03:00, an hour after the original time set. Then the scout swimmer was recalled on board and "Ambra" departed back to La Spezia. Meanwhile, at 05:00, the explosions started to rock the freighters. The "Ocean Vanquisher" (7,174 tons) and the Norwegian "Berta" (1,493 tons) sank, while the "Empire Centaur" (7,041 tons) and the "Armatan" (4,587 tons) were heavily damaged. The American landing ship "LSM-59" became stranded on the beach. Sixteen Italian divers were captured.

What Took You So Long? (The Courteeners song)

"What Took You So Long?" is the third single released by indie rock band The Courteeners, available on their debut studio album "St. Jude". It was released on 14 January 2008 on a CD single and 7-inch vinyl, reaching #20 in the UK Singles Chart. This song is often cited as the Courteeners best single to date, and broke them into the top 40 and to nationwide success. 
Lyrical meaning.
The song is a lyrical attack on bedroom exiles of the modern day with no experience of the real world and living their lives through internet forums and social networking sites, boasting their music taste being superior to that of people with real lives and real social tendencies due to liking a more obscure band. As Fray and Campbell put it in a 2008 interview for Channel 4:
The song also features the lyric "Do you know who I am? I'm like a Morrissey with some strings", which did little to disassociate the band with their Manchester roots, but shifted the focus from traditional Manchester "lad-rock" contingents such as Oasis and the Happy Mondays, to the more intellectual and acclaimed Smiths.
Chart performance.
The single was released on 18 January 2008 as a CD single and was also made available as a 7  inch vinyl. The single entered the UK Singles Chart at a peak of #20, beating the bands prior singles.
Uses of the Song.
The song was used for a series of television advertisements circa-Winter 2008 for the UK DCSF (Department for Children, Schools and Families) 'Science and Maths' campaign aimed at high school students aged between 11-16 year olds to showcase the interesting and exciting jobs taking Science and Maths in school, can lead young people to.

Constraint graph

In constraint satisfaction research of artificial intelligence and operations research, constraint graphs and hypergraphs are used to represent relations among constraints in a constraint satisfaction problem. A constraint graph is a special case of a factor graph, which allows for the existence of free variables.
Constraint hypergraph.
The constraint hypergraph of a constraint satisfaction problem is a hypergraph in which hypervertices correspond to the variables and the hyperedges correspond to the constraints. Two hypervertices are in the same hyperedge if the two variables occur in the same constraint.
A simple way to represent the constraint hypergraph is by using a classical graph with the following properties:
Properties 1 and 2 define a bipartite graph. The definition of the hypergraph is obtained by defining the hypervertices as the variable-vertices and the hyperedges as the sets of variable-vertices connected to each constraint-vertex.
Primal constraint graph.
The primal constraint graph or simply primal graph (also the Gaifman graph) of a constraint satisfaction problem is the graph whose nodes are the variables of the problem and an edge joins a pair of variables if the two variables occur together in a constraint. 
The primal constraint graph is in fact the primal graph of the constraint hypergraph. 
Dual constraint graph.
The set of variables involved in a constraint is called the constraint scope. 
The dual constraint graph is the graph in which the vertices are all possible constraint scopes involved in the constraints of the problem and two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding scopes have common variables.

Eugene Weingand

Eugene Weingand (April 1, 1934 – 1986) was a German-born American actor, known as Peter Lorre Jr.
Weingand was born in Karlsruhe, Germany and immigrated to the U.S. at age 20. Because of his resemblance to Peter Lorre he began calling himself Peter Lorie Jr. ("sic"). In 1963 he applied to have his name legally changed to Peter Lorie Jr., but Peter Lorre objected, as did American International Pictures, which had Lorre under contract. After a hearing the judge denied Weingand's petition, deciding he was merely trying to cash in on the name. Weingand was barred from using the name Peter Lorie Jr. without Lorre's permission. Lorre died a few months later and Weingand began calling himself Peter Lorre Jr ("sic"), and even began claiming to be the son of the actor. Under this name he made a handful of film and TV appearances in the 1960s and 70s, and subsequently dropped out of sight. He had an uncredited appearance in the Alfred Hitchcock movie "Torn Curtain" as a taxi driver.
He died in Houston, Texas.

1947–48 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1947–48 campaign was a dreadful season for Town under new manager George Stephenson, brother of Town legend Clem Stephenson. They would finish the season in 19th place in Division 1, but had to endure the humiliation of being knocked out of the FA Cup by Southern League side Colchester United.
Review.
Following David Steele's resignation, George Stephenson, brother of Town legend Clem was appointed as the new manager at Leeds Road. The previous season's 20th place finish needed to improve and Town made a bright start with 3 wins in the first 6 games, including a 5–1 win at Grimsby Town. A 5–1 win at Bolton Wanderers, the following month stopped a winless run of 6 matches, but Town only won 12 matches in the league all season and never won more than 2 matches in a row.
The main lowlight of a dreadful season, however, came in the FA Cup, when Town lost 1–0 to Southern League side Colchester United. It is still renowned as one of the most high-profile giant-killings in FA Cup history.

The Jeffersonian (newspaper)

The Jeffersonian was a weekly newspaper published on Thursdays, in Jeffersontown, Jefferson County, Kentucky. The Jeffersonian was first published on June 13, 1907, and was last published in 1965. 
History.
Beginning.
"The Jeffersonian" was founded by W. C. Barrickman and J.C. Alcock 
Alcock later bought out Barrickman and became the sole owner of the paper.
In 1913 Alcock bought half of the old Jefferson County Bank's lot and, later in 1913, constructed a new building for "The Jeffersonian". 
The new "Jeffersonian" building contained the offices and presses for the paper, In addition to "The Jeffersonian", "The St Matthews Sun" was also printed and distributed from this building. 
Although headquartered in, and focused on, Jeffersontown, Kentucky, "The Jeffersonian" reported on all of Jefferson County. "The Jeffersonian" reported from as far away as Bullitt and Spencer counties as well.
"The Jeffersonian" soon had upwards of forty reporters, much of "The Jeffersonian's" information came from a group of ladies, from various parts of Jefferson County, who gathered it up for the paper. 
Decline.
"The Jeffersonian" went into decline when the Kentucky statutes were changed to require that legal notices were to be printed in the newspaper of each county with the largest circulation. As "The Jeffersonian" was not the newspaper with the largest circulation in Jefferson County it lost a lot of advertising revenue that it had previously garnered from legal notices.
Demise.
In 1959 Alden J. Schansberg bought "The Jeffersonian". In 1965 Schansberg merged "The Jeffersonian" into the "St Matthews Voice".

Power management IC

Power Management ICs (PMICs) are integrated circuits (or a system block in a system-on-a-chip device) for managing power requirements of the host system.
A PMIC is often included in battery operated devices such as mobile phones and portable media players.
Overview.
Many modern electronic devices have multiple internal voltages and sources of external power.
Common voltages for electronics are 5 V, 3.3 V, 1.8 V, etc. Many modern gadgets also have various sources of power to charge their batteries including USB.
"Power management IC" is a generic term for a class of integrated circuits, that perform the various functions related to the power requirements.
A PMIC may have one or more of the following functions:
Features.
A PMIC may include battery management, voltage regulation, and charging functions. It may include a DC to DC converter to allow dynamic voltage scaling. Some models are known to feature up to 95% power conversion efficiency. Some models integrate with dynamic frequency scaling in a combination known as DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling).
It may be manufactured using BiCMOS process. They may come as QFN package. Some models feature I²C or SPI serial bus communications interface for I/O.
Some models feature a low-dropout regulator (LDO), and a real-time clock (RTC) co-operating with a backup battery.
A PMIC can use pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) and pulse-width modulation (PWM). It can use switching amplifier (Class-D electronic amplifier).
IC manufacturers.
Freescale Semiconductor, Dialog Semiconductor, International Rectifier, Intersil, Maxim Integrated Products, Linear Technology, Renesas Electronics, Rohm Semiconductor, and Texas Instruments are some of many manufacturers of PMICs.

Henry T. Waskow

Henry Thomas Waskow (September 24, 1918 – December 14, 1943) was a US Army captain memorialized in Ernie Pyle's dispatch "The Death of Captain Waskow," which in turn was faithfully portrayed in the movie "The Story of G.I. Joe". The column also publicized the documentary film "The Battle of San Pietro", by John Huston, depicting the action in which Waskow died.
Ernie Pyle wrote of Captain Waskow:
In this war I have known a lot of officers who were loved and respected by the soldiers under them. But never have I crossed the trail of any man as beloved as Capt. Henry T. Waskow of Belton, Texas.
Biography.
Childhood and adolescence.
Waskow was born in DeWitt County, Texas, the seventh of eight children, by children of German immigrants. His parents were cotton farmers, and moved around in various places in Texas until settling in Belton, Texas, when Henry was two years old. He attended the public schools and graduated from Belton High School in 1935, as president of the student council, receiving top grades and showing a particular aptitude for mathematics.
College and early military career.
He attended Temple Junior College on a scholarship, often commuting by foot from his parents' home, and taking on custodial duties on campus. During his college years, he enlisted in the Texas Army National Guard, in the 143rd Infantry Regiment, 36th Infantry Division with his two older brothers, John Otto Waskow, and August Waskow.
Following his two years in junior college, Waskow was offered a position as a teacher but turned it down to attend Trinity University, which was then in Waxahachie, Texas. He graduated with a bachelor's degree on June 5, 1939, and was offered a job at Belton High School. He turned it down, expecting to be called for full-time military duty.
World War II.
When President Franklin D. Roosevelt put the National Guard under federal control and activated the 36th Infantry Division, the Waskow brothers were transferred to Camp Bowie in January 1941. Waskow was given his commission as a lieutenant on March 14, 1941 and received training in Fort Benning before being assigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, 143rd Infantry Regiment.
As an officer, Waskow proved to be a principled and compassionate leader, giving those under his command individual attention. He attended various training programs throughout the country before rejoining his unit in Camp Edwards in Falmouth, Massachusetts. While there, he was promoted to captain.
In early April 1943, the 36th was shipped from New York harbor to Oran, Algeria, and was then stationed in Rabat in Morocco. The unit was kept in reserve until September 9, when it landed on Red Beach near the ancient city of Paestum in the Campania region of Italy as part of "Operation Avalanche". Waskow saw combat for the first time in the struggle to hold and enlarge the beachhead and for the Chiunzi Pass, where he commanded company B. His brother August was wounded during the battle and sent home.
Waskow and his men fought their way north past Naples, relieving the 3rd Infantry Division near Mignano and then marched on, largely on mountain trails to Monte Sammucro (Hill 1205), near San Pietro Infine. The battle for San Pietro was one of the worst in the Italian Campaign. After a week, Waskow's company had been reduced to the size of a platoon, but participated in the assaults. On the evening of December 12, on his way up from the treeline to launch an attack on a ridge known as Hill 730 (), his unit was attacked, and a shell hit near him and his men. Shrapnel caught him in the chest and killed him almost immediately.
Ernie Pyle.
Riley Tidwell, who had been Waskow's assistant throughout the war, left Waskow's body where he had died and went down from the mountain to notify Waskow's superiors that he had been killed. On the way, he encountered Ernie Pyle, the noted war reporter.
Pyle waited the three days it took to recover Waskow's body. It was when the body was unloaded from the back of the mule in the middle of the night along with several other casualties, and his men made their emotional farewells with their commander, that Pyle was inspired to write the dispatch that memorialized Waskow. Pyle published his column on January 10, and stacks of letters started arriving to Waskow's survivors in Belton afterwards. His sister released a photograph of Waskow taken while he was a lieutenant, after adding another bar to reflect his captain's rank when he died.
Following his wishes, Waskow was buried in Italy. His grave is at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery in Nettuno. His grave is on Plot G Row 6 Grave 33.
A memorial was held for him in his home town when his mother died a few months later, and he was posthumously awarded the Legion of Merit. He was also awarded the Purple Heart.
Legacy.
Pyle wrote the column about Waskow a few days after his death, in Caserta, where he had become depressed and was drinking heavily. He asked AP correspondent Don Whitehead to read the columns, exclaiming, "I’ve lost the touch. This stuff stinks. I just can’t seem to get going again." Whitehead recognized its tremendous value and urged its publication. It was first published a month later, after notification of the next of kin, in Scripps-Howard's home newspaper, the "Washington Daily News", which gave it front page billing, and sold out its entire edition. The entire column was read on the radio by Raymond Gram Swing and Arthur Godfrey. It was reprinted in "Time" magazine, and was used for a war bond drive.
In his last will and testament, Waskow wrote:
Pyle's story informed John Huston's documentary "The Battle of San Pietro "(released in 1945) and heightened interest in it. The character of Captain Bill Walker (played by Robert Mitchum) in William Wellman's motion picture "The Story of G.I. Joe" is partly based on Pyle's column about Waskow's death. The US Army insisted on changing the surname of Waskow to Walker in the film's screenplay
Henry T. Waskow High School in Belton and VFW Hall 4008 are named after Waskow.

Metrologists perform metrology work involving precision measurement and comparison of physical quantities such as mass, length, time, force, speed, voltage and current. They calibrate precision equipment which measures these physical units. They may also certify that outside standards of such quantities as mass and volume are correct. Congress has authorized the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to set the standards of all physical quantities in the United States. The NIST was formerly called the National Bureau of Standards. Highly skilled metrologists are essential to the work of NIST.

Leigh Haggerwood

Leigh Haggerwood is a contemporary composer based in Bath, UK. He specializes in songwriting, keyboards, singing, music production, audio engineering and sound-to-picture scoring. His credits include music for numerous TV shows and commercials which are broadcast around the world.
Along with chef Jamie Oliver, Leigh Haggerwood was a founding member of the band Scarlet Division, who released the single, "Sundial", in October 2000 through Sony Music.
Haggerwood also wrote several songs for Jamie Oliver's live shows which included the YouTube hit "Lamb Curry - Give It to Me Hot", "The Kiss of Summer and "Fish Stew". His TV credits include the ITV "Text Santa" Theme and incidental musical, "Oliver's Twist", Trinny and Susannah, "Jamie's School Dinners", "Petrolheads" on BBC Two and TV Land's "High School Reunion".
The Florin Street Band.
Haggerwood is best known for his Victorian-themed creation The Florin Street Band which he put together to record an original Christmas song he had written called "My Favourite Time of Year". Disappointed by the demise of Christmas song writing in the UK, Leigh set out to create a traditional-sounding song with epic production values and strong melodies. His idea included a music video set in 19th century England with snow-lined streets, lanterns, period costumes and snow-dusted rooftops. UK record companies would not fund such an ambitious idea as they did not consider it financially viable. So Leigh eventually decided to make it happen himself by employing session musicians to record the song and funding the music video with his life savings.
He produced the record at Trevor Horn's Sarm Studios and requested the services of 36 session musicians including The English Chamber Choir. The majority of Leigh's work is sung and performed by other artists, but Leigh decided to sing "My Favourite Time of Year" himself so that he could maintain the Victorian theme and make sure it would end up as he intended.
The period music video was the biggest challenge of the project, but after a long search, Leigh found talented British director, Nick Bartleet, who shared his vision and helped make it a reality. As the plans progressed, American cinematographer John Perez offered his services as Director of Photography, and the extraordinary video was shot at Blists Hill Victorian Town at Ironbridge in Shropshire. The song and video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H10f2w7T5CU] received an public response through social networking websites with many people describing it as a future classic. The song has won the UK Songwriting Contest.
Text Santa is a charity initiative first broadcast on UK television network, ITV, in 2011. The project aims to raise money and awareness for a number of charities during the festive season and is heavily promoted by ITV in the form of TV shows, radio and sponsorship by major brands. The producers were keen to use "My Favourite Time of Year" as the theme music to the appeal, which Leigh agreed to. With his experience as a media composer, he re-versioned the song and created other original music for the shows.
Since releasing "My Favourite Time of Year" in 2010, Leigh Haggerwood has created a Florin Street Christmas musical. In 2013 he decided to make another Victorian music video for one of the new songs entitled Winter Wonder, which is about a celebration that the towns-folk put on as Winter draws in. The music video featured 100 cast members including dancers and local children from the village of Englishcombe in Bath, UK where it was filmed at the 14th century Tithe barn. "Winter Wonder" with lyrics and music by Leigh Haggerwood, was released on 16 December 2013 with "My Favourite Time of Year" as the B-side track.

The Roads

The Roads is a neighborhood of Miami in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It is a triangular area located south of SW 11th Street, between SW 12th Avenue and SW 15th Road, just west of Brickell. 
The Roads is known for its old homes, historic public schools, and its tree-covered streets. The Roads is very close to Downtown and Brickell, but is a historically residential neighborhood. It is also off the normal Miami street grid, and thus all the streets in The Roads are named roads, instead of streets and avenues, as is the case in the rest of Miami. Since 1986, the Miami Roads Neighborhood Civic Association has worked on a variety of projects to support the neighborhood.
The Roads neighborhood is served by the Miami Metrorail at the Vizcaya station to the south and by the Brickell station to the north.
History.
The Roads, originally called "Brickell Hammock" was designed, platted and developed by Mary Brickell in January 1922 days before her death. Mary Brickell had designed the Roads as a pedestrian-friendly neighborhood, with wide streets with median parkways and roundabouts with native Miami plants. Mary Brickell gave the streets, parkways, sidewalks, and electric lighting to the City of Miami in 1922. All the properties were sold in a single day on February 1, 1923. 
Although the homes in the Roads were originally planned to be affordable for Miamians, homes in the Roads were popular early on and quickly became one of Miami's most prestigious neighborhoods. During the 1970s and 80s, the Roads is said to be the only inner-city neighborhood in Florida that did not fall to urban decay, and maintained its quality. Today, many of the residents in the Roads are urban professionals who work in neighboring Downtown Miami and Brickell.
Geography.
It is located at , with an elevation , making it one of the higher areas in the city.
The Roads is also an entire off-grid plan section of the city of Miami. The streets and avenues in Miami-Dade County are aligned to a grid, where streets run east-west and avenues run north-south. The roads that run from Broadway to SW 32nd Road are roughly 45 degrees out of alignment with the grid-plan. The avenues running perpendicular to these roads are also 45 degrees out of alignment with their respective avenues coming from the north. The avenues in this section run northeast-southwest rather than the standard north-south that the ones in the rest of the county follow. This causes an abrupt change in numerical designation as they cross SW 12th Avenue (SW 5th Avenue turns west and becomes SW 18th Street, SW 4th Avenue turns west and becomes SW 20th Street, SW 2nd Avenue turns west and becomes SW 22nd Street, etc.) The most well known example of this confusion is when historic Coral Way being SW 3rd Avenue, makes a 45 degree turn onto SW 22nd Street as it crosses over SW 12th Avenue.
Transportation.
The Roads is served by Metrobus throughout the area, and by the Miami Metrorail at: 
Metrorail has stops throughout Miami with service to Greater Miami and Miami International Airport, all Miami-Dade County bus lines, Tri-Rail and Amtrak. The main bus station in Downtown is located next to the Arsht Center at the Adrienne Arsht Center Station.

ALAS (Fundacion América Latina en Acción Solidaria) is a movement dedicated to the children in Latin America. The non-profit organisation is founded by Latin America's most influential artists, intellectuals and business leaders, and strives to launch a new social movement that will generate a collective commitment to comprehensive Early Childhood Development programs for the children in Latin America.
One of the well-known faces and founder of ALAS is the Colombian singer and UNICEF ambassador Shakira. Other known artists are Juanes, Alejandro Sanz and Miguel Bosé, among others. Honorary President is Nobel prize winner Gabriel García Márquez. Shakira's ex-fiancé Antonio de la Rúa is one of the Vice Presidents. De la Rúa recently rebutted the allegation that artists are leaving ALAS because of mismanagement.
Objectives.
Latin America has 54 million children age 5 and under and no less than 32 million of them are currently living in poverty. A catalyst for change, ALAS will work to improve the children's lives by creating a social movement that delivers effective health, education and nutritional programs during their most influential years of development through comprehensive Early Childhood Development.
Mega Concerts.
On 17 May 2008, for the first time, two concerts were held simultaneously in Argentina and Mexico. Shakira, Alejandro Sanz, Calle 13, Paulina Rubio, Gustavo Cerati and others artists performed in Buenos Aires, where 150 thousand people gathered. In Mexico City, Miguel Bosé, Ricky Martin, Chayanne, Lucero and Diego Torres were some of the artists on the stage list. Juanes did not participate in either concert. The Mexico concert was attended by no less than 200 thousand people. Both concerts were completely free and their only goal was to make the public aware of the problems around poverty of Latin-American children.
Problems with ALAS.
ALAS has changed leaders and missions since its inception on December 12, 2006. Its third executive director, Carlos Clemente, was indicted on corruption charges alongside Shakira lawyer/ALAS founding director José María Michavila. Its original mission including providing funding to programs that helped needy children. Its stated mission now is to be a social movement that does not fund programs. As a result, it has received millions of dollars from its funders for events like the May 2008 concerts but has not funded any programs.
Antonio de la Rúa has recently been answering charges that disappointment in the organization has caused many of the original artists to leave ALAS and that ALAS has not delivered on its promise to fund programs in Buenos Aires.

Best of You

"Best of You" is a song by American alternative rock band Foo Fighters, and the first single released from the band's fifth studio album, "In Your Honor" (2005). Dave Grohl notes that the song was written following appearances at 2004 American presidential candidate John Kerry's campaign trail and is "about breaking away from the things that confine you." To date, it is the band's only single to reach Platinum status in the US. The song holds the band's highest chart peaks in the US (#18), the UK (#4), and Australia (#5), and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song won the Kerrang! Award for Best Single. It also topped Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks and Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for seven weeks. Following the band's performance at Live Earth, the song again entered the UK charts at #38.
Background.
In an interview discussing the band's successful singles, Dave Grohl notes that: ""Best of You" is funny because we demoed so many songs for "In Your Honor", I'd kind of forgotten about it. Our manager came in and said, "What happened to that "Best of You" song?" So we pulled it out and worked on it a little more."
Music video.
The music video was directed by Mark Pellington, best known for his work on the video for "Jeremy" by Pearl Jam. He was inspired by the death of his wife a few months prior to the shoot, and was drawn to the song's notion of dealing with pain in life.
The video features the band playing on top of abandoned hospital, Linda Vista Community Hospital. Along with the band's scenes are clips that show pain, depression, or anger:
Anastacia version.
Anastacia covered the song for her fifth studio album "It's a Man's World". The song was released as album's second single, only in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.

The Mask

The Mask is a Dark Horse comic book series created by writer John Arcudi and artist Doug Mahnke, and based on a concept by publisher Mike Richardson. The series follows a magical mask which imbues the wearer with reality-bending powers and physical imperviousness, as well as bypassing the wearer's psychological inhibitions. It was adapted into the 1994 film "The Mask", starring Jim Carrey, which was followed by an voiced by Rob Paulsen and a sequel made in 2005, "Son of the Mask".
Overview.
In all versions the story initially revolves around a magical mask which gives any wearer limitless power and an altered appearance, characterized by a large set of teeth and a green head. The mask affects the personality of the wearer by removing all personal social inhibitions, causing the wearer to become insane. The book was inspired by a combination of earlier characters: The Joker and Steve Ditko's Creeper, as well as "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". In the original comic stories, characters who wore the Mask would become dangerous and cruel antiheroes with ultraviolent tendencies, even if this was not the wearer's original intention. When adapted into a film, the violence was toned down to make the Mask only as dangerous as its wearer. In both the 1994 film and animated television show, the main character Stanley Ipkiss was depicted as a benevolent yet mischievous superhero. The same is true of the 2005 sequel's main character Tim Avery, who is named after Tex Avery.
The title of the comic book originally referred to the mask itself and not the character it unleashed. In early stories, the character was referred to as Big Head; it was not until the films and television series that the character became known as The Mask.
The Mask (comic books).
The base concept of The Mask was created by Mike Richardson in 1982. It first saw life as a single sketch he made in 1985 for "APA-5", an amateur press publication created by writer Mark Verheiden. After starting Dark Horse Comics, Richardson pitched his concept to Marvel comic book writer/artist Mark Badger, which resulted in the Masque strip that ran in the early issues of "Dark Horse Presents". Badger's strips became increasingly political, and Richardson ended the strip in order to bring the character back to his original concept.
Artist Chris Warner was hired to revamp the character based on Richardson's original "APA-5" drawing and created the definitive look for the character. The character was given a new launch in 1989 in the pages of Dark Horse's "Mayhem" anthology. Aspiring writer John Arcudi and artist Doug Mahnke were hired to create the new adventures, which became the first very popular use of the character, "a combination of Tex Avery and The Terminator". The Mask stories from "Mayhem" #1-4 were later collected as the 1991 issue "The Mask #0" and in a trade paperback collection as well.
"Mayhem" was canceled after four issues, but in 1991 Arcudi and Mahnke continued with "The Mask" four issue limited series, which introduced one of the Mask's antagonists, a mute brutish hulk named Walter. This run was among Dark Horse's best sellers; following it, the company continued a succession of miniseries around the Mask, with various antagonists wearing the mask. These series concluded in 2000 with the DC Comics crossover "Joker/Mask", in which the magical Mask finds its way into the hands of Batman's arch-enemy The Joker. The first major storylines and the Joker/Mask crossover have all been collected in trade-paperback and in a limited edition hardcover box set.
Original ongoing series
The Mask (#0-4)
In an antiques shop, a weak, neurotic man named Stanley Ipkiss shops for a gift to give to his girlfriend, Kathy. At the store he purchases an old jade mask which begins to speak to him. When Stanley wears it, he is transformed into a wacky, superpowered being with an abnormally large, bald, green-skinned head and a mouthful of large teeth. After exploring his new abilities, Ipkiss goes on a rampage, taking revenge on personal grudges, and earns the nickname Big Head.
After taking the mask off, Stan begins to realize what has been happening. His acts as Big Head begin to take an emotional toll on him. He becomes verbally abusive toward Kathy. She kicks him out but keeps the mask since Stanley had bought it as a gift for her.
Later Stan breaks into her apartment to steal it back just as the police respond to their earlier domestic violence call. Deciding his only way out is as Big Head, Stan places the mask back on and kills 11 cops in his escape. He returns home as Big Head and takes off the mask only to be shot in the back and killed by Kathy, who has put two and two together and figured out the identity of Big Head, before putting the mask on herself.
Kathy takes the mask to Lt. Kellaway for safe-keeping. Kellaway, who had been struggling at both the recent Big Head murders and organized crime lords running loose through his city, disregards Kathy's warnings and tries on the mask thinking she is stressed, and not thinking well. Becoming Big Head, Kellaway sets out to take down the crime lords who have plagued his police career.
The city, not knowing of the magical mask, assumes Big Head is still the same killer but has moved his target list to high profile crime lords. Despite Kellaway's good intentions, the mask turns his methods increasingly more violent. Big Head encounters Walter, a behemoth-sized mob muscle-man who never speaks and has taken a vendetta against Big Head for killing his employers. Walter never shows pain and is the only one who can injure Big Head to any real degree.
While fighting off Walter's attacks, Lt. Kellaway, as Big Head, becomes the target of a police manhunt. Big Head fights off the police and tracks down the remaining mobsters. When Kellaway's partner attempts to stop Big Head, the mask-altered policeman nearly kills his friend and colleague. Kellaway, realizing what he has been doing, flees. He removes the mask, buries it away in his basement with cement, and vows never to let it be worn again. 
The first half of the story following Stan as Big Head was originally published in the four-issue anthology series "Mayhem" and was then collected as the first part of The Mask trade paperback.
The Mask Returns (#1-4)
The crime lords send men to Lt. Kellaway's home and attempt to kill him. Kellaway makes his way to the basement in an attempt to retrieve the mask but is wounded before he can put it on and is put into a coma. After the shooting, the men escape, taking the mask with them. One of them puts it on the wimpy driver, Nunzio, as a joke, but he then becomes Big Head. Big Head kills the thugs and kills all of the crime lords, and becomes the city's preeminent crime boss. Kathy, realizing the return of Big Head means Kellaway failed to hide the mask well enough, knows that it's up to her to stop him. She dresses as a hooker, and Big Head falls head over heels. She tricks him into taking off the mask, and she pulls out a gun, then Nunzio dives for the mask but is shot and killed. Kathy uses the mask to escape and decides to go after the real crime boss (who Big Head stole the office from while he was in Miami) Don Mozzo. When Don comes back from Miami, he knows Big Head is after him and so he goes for help from the one man who can help him, Walter.
The Mask Strikes Back (#1-5)
Four friends, named Rick, Ben, Hugo, and Archie, all fascinated by the Big Head murders, find that all their lives are at a dead end, until one of them finds the magical mask by the city pier and brings it home. Realizing this was the source of their hero's power, each of the four take turns trying it on. They attempt to use its power to fix their lives but only end up making things worse for themselves. By the end, Walter finds the mask in his hands and is unable to use it and, in frustration, throws it into the distance with tremendous force.
This was the last series in the original Mask storyline by Arcudi and Mahnke. It was also the first to be made after the success of "The Mask" film and as such the violence of the earlier stories was toned down and the Tex Avery aspects were more prominent than before.
The Mask: The Hunt for Green October (#1-4)
The Mask continues to find its way into the hands of unwitting wearers. Ray Tuttle, a loser film-buff and his daughter Emily discover its power, but Lt. Kellaway is looking to take it from them. The title parodies the title of the novel "The Hunt for Red October".
The Mask: World Tour (#1-4)
A new wearer of the magical mask finds his way traveling through the Dark Horse Comics universe.
The Mask: Southern Discomfort (#1-4)
In New Orleans, the mask ends up in the hands of Eric Martin who tries to find his sister, all while Lt. Kellaway looks to destroy it.

The Mask: Official Movie Adaptation
A two issue comic book adaptation of the 1994 film starring Jim Carrey. In addition to retelling the story of the first movie, this comic book version contains short moments of the story which were cut out of the final film. This includes the deleted scenes most often seen as extra features in video releases of "The Mask", most significantly, the death of supporting character Peggy Brandt. It also includes completely unseen moments such as Stanley Ipkiss' watch being stolen by the same group of thugs that he pays back with the balloon animal routine and dialog by the mechanics right before they are burst in on by The Mask. Some dialog is also changed. In this version, Stanley is more of the shy, clumsy version from the animated series.

Following the success of the first Mask movie, which led to the release of "", Dark Horse published this spinoff comic series which followed the continuity of the television cartoon. Like the television show, this title combined elements of both the original adult comics and the Jim Carrey movie. Elements from the film included The Mask as Jim Carrey portrayed him in the film: goofy and heroic with his trademark yellow suit. From the early comics were Walter, still Pretorius' Henchman, and a Lt. Kellaway more like his original counterpart than as depicted in film.
This series ran monthly from January 1996 until December of the same year.

Batman is able to trick the Joker into removing the Mask by claiming that the villain is no longer funny, and is relying on tired schtick and the power of the Mask instead of his own style. It is worth mentioning that the Joker himself had enough will power to "emerge" from the Mask's body (resulting in a two-headed being) in order to remove the mask on his own. Lt. Kellaway asks Batman to give him the Mask. Batman agrees and the Mask is last seen as Kellaway digs up Stanley Ipkiss' grave and buries the Mask there with his corpse.

"The Mask" (1994).
A film version of "The Mask" was released in the United States on July 29, 1994, starring Jim Carrey in the title role. Directed by Chuck Russell, the film co-starred Peter Greene as Dorian Tyrell, Peter Riegert as Lt. Mitch Kellaway, Orestes Matacena as Niko, Richard Jeni as Charlie Schumacher, Amy Yasbeck as Peggy Brandt, and Cameron Diaz, in her screen debut, as Tina Carlyle. Ben Stein has a cameo role as Dr. Arthur Neuman.
While there were early efforts to take the movie in the direction of horror (some at New Line Cinema saw it as a replacement for their fading "Nightmare On Elm Street" franchise), it was never completely intended as a ""dark horror"" picture. New Line had problems coming up with a script that could show violence that was comical, but had more success with a story that had comedy that was violent. Richardson always pushed in the direction of the Tex Avery concept which was eventually adopted, despite the efforts of several potential directors, including, initially, Chuck Russell, to make the move to horror. Richardson also resisted early attempts to attach both Martin Short and Rick Moranis to the lead role. Mike Deluca's suggestion of Jim Carrey for the lead, together with Mark Verheiden's ""Cuban Pete"" production number, set the final tone for the film.
The plot of the film was loosely based on the first half of the Arcudi/Mahnke comic book miniseries. It uses only a few scenes from the comic, including the scenes of the muffler mechanics and the street gang and balloon animals.
Mike Richardson's comic origin for the character came from the ancestor worship of ancient Africans that formed the basis for the voodoo that came centuries later. In the film, however, the Loki-based origin was grafted on in Chuck Russell's screenplay. A deleted scene is featured on the DVD, where a band of Vikings drag a chest containing the mask onto the shore of North America which was also depicted in the Dark Horse Comics two-part comic book adaptation of the film.
The movie also spin-off into a video game adaptation, released for the Super NES in 1995.
"The Mask: The Animated Series" (1995–1997).
The movie version of the character subsequently appeared in an animated TV series entitled ' (with Rob Paulsen as Stanley Ipkiss/The Mask) and his own short-run comic book series based upon the TV show, "Adventures of The Mask". John Arcudi wrote season one's "How Much is That Dog in the Tin Can" and season three's "The Goofalotatots" (a parody of Warner Bros.' "Animaniacs"). Much as with the "Beetlejuice" cartoon before it, The Mask TAS took many elements from the source movie but made numerous changes. Tina was absent, and reporter Peggy Brandt had become the main female character but not love interest. Also unlike in the movie, Ipkiss appeared to be able to use the mask in daytime as well as at night. The series also had a crossover with ', another animated series based on a Jim Carrey film.
Four VHS volumes of the series were released (an extra two were released in Australia), all of which are now out of print. Upon the initial DVD release of the "Son of the Mask", Wal-Mart stores sold an exclusive 2-pack of the movie with the pilot episode of the animated series ("The Mask Is Always Greener On Other Side" Parts 1&2). As of 2012, this is the only DVD release of the series.
"Son of the Mask" (2005).
Son of the Mask is the poorly received sequel to the 1994 comedy film, "The Mask", directed by Lawrence Guterman. The movie had a $84 million budget and a $17 million domestic box office gross, along with a $40 million foreign box office gross.
Director Chuck Russell, who helmed the original film, expressed his interest in a "Mask" sequel in his 1996 LaserDisc commentary. He was hoping Jim Carrey would come back as The Mask, along with Amy Yasbeck, who played Peggy in the original. Russell decided to cut scenes when Peggy dies and leave the character open for the sequel, which became this film. The concept was completely changed when Carrey decided not to return, focusing on another man (played by Jamie Kennedy) finding the Mask and unintentionally conceiving a child while wearing it- resulting in a son who possesses the powers of the Mask without needing to wear it-, at the same time as Loki (played by Alan Cumming), the Norse God and original creator of the Mask, searches the human world attempting to find it.
Ben Stein reprises his role of Dr. Arthur Neuman from the first film. He is involved in the movie to reestablish the relationship between the mask and its creator, Loki. He is the only actor to appear in both films as well as the Mask cartoon series.
Powers and abilities.
In the original comics, the mask has superhuman physical attributes and intelligence, a healing factor, the ability to look like other people, and the ability to create objects out of the air. A perfect example to The Mask almost omnipotent powers happened when The Mask managed to swallow whole an entire hulking alien mutant invader by shapeshifting his head and mouth to giantic sizes. The Alien found himself bounded by the chains in the cave like stomach system of The Mask and he encountered a cannibal caricature of The Mask, ready to devour him alive in his own stomach.
In the other media, the mask's reality warping powers are more powerful, and it has more cartoon physics-style abilities, such as:
The Mask also travels in a similar way to The Flash, by propelling himself to tornado speed. It is proven to be a devastating combination of brute force and speed that he instantly killed 11 cops when the tornado hit them.
His only weakness is also his strongest weapon, a very unstable condition of mind. The Masked individual completely goes insane after transformation and another person may persuade him to remove the mask.

The Starship

The Starship was a former United Airlines Boeing 720 passenger jet, bought by Bobby Sherman and his manager, Ward Sylvester, and leased to touring musical artists in the mid-1970s.
History.
"The Starship", N7201U (S/N: 17907), was the first Boeing 720 built. It was delivered to United Airlines on October 1960 and then purchased in 1973 by Contemporary Entertainment.
English rock band Led Zeppelin used the aircraft for their 1973 and 1975 North American concert tours. During the 1972 tour and in the early part of the 1973 tour the band had hired a small private Falcon Jet to transport its members from city to city, but these aircraft are comparatively light and susceptible to turbulence. After performing a show at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco in 1973 Led Zeppelin encountered bad turbulence on a flight back to Los Angeles. As a result, the band's manager Peter Grant resolved to hire "The Starship" for the remainder of the tour, at a cost of $30,000.
The aircraft was the same type as used by commercial airlines, but its owners allowed it to be specifically modified to suit the whim of their clients. Sherman and Sylvester invested $200,000 to reduce its seating capacity to forty and to install into the main cabin a bar, seats and tables, revolving arm chairs, a couch (running along the right hand side of the plane, opposite the bar), a television set and a video cassette player, complete with a well-stocked video library. An electronic organ was built into the bar, and at the rear of the craft were two back rooms, one with a low couch and pillows on the floor, and the other, a bedroom, complete with a white fur bedspread and shower room. The exterior of the plane was re-sprayed with "Led Zeppelin" emblazoned down the side of the fuselage. 
Flying on "The Starship", Led Zeppelin were no longer required to change hotels so often. They could base themselves in large cities such as Chicago, New York, Dallas and Los Angeles and travel to and from concerts within flying distance. After each show, the band members would be transported direct by limousine from the concert venue to the airport, as depicted in the Led Zeppelin concert film "The Song Remains the Same".
"The Starship" was used throughout Led Zeppelin's 1975 US concert tour, this time featuring a different red-and-blue paint scheme with white stars similar to the United States flag, and with a smaller "Led Zeppelin" logo on the fuselage. According to Peter Grant, at one point during this tour Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham sat in the co-pilot's seat and assisted in flying the plane all the way from New York to Los Angeles.
"The Starship" is included at the end of "Stairway to Heaven" on disc 2 of the "Led Zeppelin DVD" with both its 1973 and 1975 paint schemes.
English rock band Deep Purple hired "The Starship" for their 1974 U.S. Tour. They can be seen arriving in the jet with the band's name emblazoned on the jet in the DVD for the infamous California Jam rock festival, entitled "Live in California 74". In an interview with "Circus" magazine in 1974, Deep Purple's Jon Lord explained: "It's a 707 put together by a firm in L.A. that Sinatra, Dylan and The Band just used and Elton John uses. It has a lounge, a bedroom, a shower and a study. It's supposed to look as little as a plane as possible." 
The Rolling Stones, The Allman Brothers and Alice Cooper were "The Starship" clients. Peter Frampton was the last to charter "The Starship" in 1976. As early as Alice Cooper's 1974 tour the aircraft was beginning to show signs of engine difficulties, and for Led Zeppelin's 1977 US Tour, it was permanently grounded at Long Beach Airport. The band was forced to find a comparable alternative, and tour manager Richard Cole eventually chartered "Caesar's Chariot", a 45-seat Boeing 707 owned by the Caesars Palace Hotel in Las Vegas.
"The Starship" went through several ownership changes from 1977 through 1979 until it went into storage at Luton Airport. It was dismantled for parts starting in July 1982.

Tsitsishvili

The Tsitsishvili () is a Georgian noble family, with several notable members from the 15th century through the 20th. 
The Tsitsishvili family was a continuation of the medieval house of Panaskerteli, known in the province of Upper Kartli (Samtskhe) from the 12th century, who derived their name from the castle of Panaskerti in Tao-Klarjeti. They came into prominence with Zachariah of Panaskerti, who, together with some other nobles, put down in 1192 the revolt against Queen Tamar of Georgia and were eventually enfeoffed with the duchy of Tao. His descendant, T'aqa Panaskerteli, Duke of Tao, defeated the Turkomans invading Georgia in about 1302 at Tortomi Castle.
In 1442, the king of Georgia, Vakhtang IV, married Sitikhatun, daughter of Prince Zaza I Panaskerteli. Pressured by the princes of Samtskhe of the Jaqeli dynasty, Zaza removed in 1467 to Inner Kartli, where he obtained from King Constantine II the fiefs of Khvedureti and Kareli. These formed the basis of a new princedom of the Panaskerteli, later known as Satsitsiano. The name Satsitsiano derived from the patronymic of Tsitsishvili, which was borne by Zaza’s posterity, but must have been derived from an earlier member of the house called Tsitsi, and not, as has sometimes been supposed, from Zaza’s son, for the patronymic is found already in an undated charter of King Alexander I of Georgia (r. 1412-1442). 
The Tsitsishvili ranked as fifth among the six "undivided" princely houses of the kingdom of Kartli, a successor state of the already fragmented kingdom of Georgia. They intermarried with the royal dynasty and other nobility of Georgia and held several top hereditary offices at the court. In the 17th century, the house divided into the Upper and Lower branches, which entailed the loss of the family’s dynastic status. Upon the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, the house of Panaskerteli-Tsitsishvili was received into the princely nobility of the empire under the name of Tsitsianov (). Earlier, in 1724, a branch of this family, also known as Tsitsianov, was established in Russia by the expatriate Georgian nobleman Paata Tsitsishvili.

Islam in Sweden

Islam has, as of 2009, 106,327 officially registered adherents among citizens and residents of Sweden. Other sources set the figure at roughly 450,000 to 500,000, which accounts for around 5% of the total Swedish population, including people who would not really regard themselves as Muslims. 
History.
The first registered Muslim groups in Sweden were Finnish Tatars who emigrated from Finland and Estonia in the 1940s. Islam began to have a noticeable presence in Sweden with immigration from the Middle East beginning in the 1970s.
Most Muslims in Sweden are either immigrants or descendants of immigrants. The majority are from the Middle East, in particular Iraq and Iran. However, 5 out of 6 Iranians in Sweden consider themselves secular rather than Muslim and are in strong opposition to the Islamic Republic regime in their ancestral home. Most Iranians and Iraqis fled as refugees to Sweden during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988. The second-largest Muslim group consists of immigrants or refugees from former Yugoslavia, most of them are Bosniaks, who number 12,000. There is also a sizeable community of Somalis, who constitute the largest immigrant group during recent years, 40 165 had moved to Sweden by 2011. They have contributed the largest share of immigrants in recent years.
Sweden has a number of mosques providing the Muslim communities in Sweden places of worship.
The Malmö Mosque, built in 1984, was followed by the Uppsala Mosque in 1995. More mosques were built during the 2000s, including the Stockholm Mosque (2000), the Umeå Mosque (2006) and the Fittja Mosque (completed 2007), among others. The governments of Saudi Arabia and Libya have financially supported the constructions of some of the largest Mosques in Sweden.
As of the year 2000, an estimated 300,000 to 350,000 people of Muslim background lived in Sweden, or 3.5% of total population; thereby included is anyone who fits the broad definition of someone who "belongs to a Muslim people by birth, has Muslim origin, has a name that belongs in the Muslim tradition, etc." regardless of personal religious convictions.), of whom about 100,000 were second-generation immigrants (born in Sweden or immigrated as children). In Sweden registration by personal belief is not common and is normally against the law, thus only figures of practising Muslims belonging to an Islamic community can be reported. In 2009, the Muslim Council of Sweden reported 106,327 registered members.
Demography.
Although there are no official statistics of Muslims in Sweden, estimates count 200,000—250,000 people of Muslim background in 2000 (i.e. anyone who fits the broad definition of someone who "belongs to a Muslim people by birth, has Muslim origin, has a name that belongs in the Muslim tradition, etc. "), roughly estimated close to 100,000 of which are second-generation. Of the first-generation Muslims, 255,000 are thought to be Sunni, 5,000 Shi’ites, no more than 1,000 Ahmadiya, Alevi and other groups and probably no more than 5,000 converts – mainly women married to Muslim men. In 2009 a US report made a statement that there are 450,000 to 500,000 Muslims in Sweden, around 5% of the total population, and that the Muslim Council of Sweden reported 106 327 officially registered members. Swedish estimates are rather 350,000, including nominal Muslims and people from a Muslim background.
Such numbers do not imply religious beliefs or participation; Åke Sander claimed in 1992 that at most 40–50% of the people of Muslim background in Sweden "could reasonably be considered to be religious", and in 2004, based on discussions and interviews with Muslim leaders, concerning second-generation Muslims born and raised in Sweden that "it does not seem that the percentage they consider to be religious Muslims in a more qualified sense exceeds fifteen percent, or perhaps even less". Sander re-stated in 2004 that "we do not think it unreasonable to put the figure of religious Muslims in Sweden at the time of writing at close to 150,000". Professor Mohammad Fazlhashemi at Umeå University estimates "a good 100,000". About 25,000 are regarded as devout Muslims, visiting Friday prayers and practising daily prayers.
Conversion.
There are no official statistics on the exact number of Swedish converts to Islam, but Anne Sofie Roald, a historian of religions at Malmö University College, estimates the number of converts from the Church of Sweden to Islam to be 3,500 people since the 1960s. Roald further states that conversions are also occurring from Islam to the Church of Sweden, most noticeably by Iranians, but also by Arabs and Pakistanis, who have fled totalitarian regimes with strong religious oppression.
The first known convert to Islam was the famous painter Ivan Aguéli who was initiated into the Shadhiliyya order in Egypt in 1909. It was Aguéli who introduced the French metaphysician René Guénon to Sufism. Aguéli is more known among Sufis by his Muslim name Abdul-Hadi al-Maghribi. Other well-known Swedish converts to Islam are Tage Lindbom, Kurt Almqvist, Mohammed Knut Bernström and Tord Olsson. Lindbom, Almqvist and Olsson are also initiates into various Sufi orders. Bernström translated the Quran into Swedish in 1998.
Places of worship.
Several mosques have been built in Sweden since the 1980s, with notable ones in Malmö (1984) and Stockholm (2000). The Bellevue Mosque and the Brandbergen Mosque in the 2000s came to public attention as recruitment and propaganda centers for Islamist terrorism.
The following are some of the places of Islamic worship that can be found today in Sweden ("See also the list of mosques in Sweden):
Associations.
The beginning of national Islamic (Sunni) institutions in Sweden dates back to the creation of FIFS ("Förenade Islamiska Församlingar i Sverige") in 1973–1974. In 1982 and 1984 two splits, due to internal rivalries, cultural differences, personal conflicts and funding, brought to the creation of SMF ("Svenska Muslimska Förbundet") and ICUS, today IKUS ("Islamska Kulturcenterunionen i Sverige"). Others national institutions are BHIRF ("Bosnien-Hercegovinas Islamiska riksförbund"), founded in 1995 by Bosnian refugees, IRFS ("Islamiska Riksförbundet"), also since 1995, and SIA (Svenska Islamiska Akademin), founded in 2000 by the former ambassador Mohammed Knut Bernström, with the task of establishing in the future an Islamic university in Sweden, charged with imam education. SIA also publishes since February 2001 the periodical "Minaret" in Swedish.
On a lower level, specific Islamic organizations targeting specific groups have been created as well. SMUF, today SUM ("Sveriges Unga Muslimer"), is the greatest youth Muslim organization since 1986, but there exist also the women association IKF ("Islamiska Kvinnoförbund i Sverige"), the youth association IUF ("Islamiska Ungdomförbundet i Sverige") and the imam association SIR ("Sveriges Imamråd"). IIF ("Islamiska Informationföreningen") is a member association of FIFS aiming at providing information about Islam in Sweden; 1986–2000 it published "Salaam", whose editorial board has always been dominated by women, mainly Swedish converts.
National and target organization have also created umbrella organizations in order to simplify their relationships to the state. FIFS and SMF have created in 1990 SMR ("Sveriges Muslimska Råd"), of which SUM is also member. The IKUS umbrella organization is named IRIS ("Islamiska Rådet i Sverige") and includes also IKF, IUF and SIR. Above all, IS ("Islamiska samarbetsrådet") deals with financial issues with the Commission for state grants to religious communities (SST); it includes FIFS, SMF, IKUS, ISS and SIF.
The following are some of the Islamic associations in Sweden:
Controversies.
Muslim Council of Sweden.
Swedish social anthropologist Aje Carlbom and parliamentarian Abderisak Aden, who has founded the Islamic Democratic Institute (Islamiska demokratiska institutet), have both stated that they believe that at least part of the leading members of SMR support Islamist ideologies and are influenced by the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood.
The Muslim Council of Sweden (SMR), an umbrella organization for Swedish Muslim organizations, has been involved in several controversies. In 2006 Mahmoud Aldebe, one of the Board members of SMR, sent letters to each of the major political parties in Sweden demanding special legislation for Muslims in Sweden, including the right to specific Islamic holidays, special public financing for the building of Mosques, that all divorces between Muslim couples be approved by an Imam, and that Imams should be allowed to teach Islam to Muslim children in public schools. The request was condemned by all political parties and the government and the Swedish Liberal Party requested that an investigation be started by the Office of the Exchequer into the use of public funding of SMR. The Chairman of the Board of SMR subsequently stated that it supported the demands made by Aldebe but that it did not think that the letter had been a good idea to communicate them in a list of demands.
Although the Board of SMR did not condemn Aldebe the letter has caused conflict within the organization.
SMR has also been accused of being closely allied to the Swedish Social Democratic Party, which has been criticised both inside and outside the party.
Brandbergen Mosque.
The Brandbergen Mosque has been described by the FBI terrorism consultant Evan Kohlmann as a propaganda central for the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). According to Kohlmann, people connected to the mosque also participated in the financing of GIA:s bombing campaign in France in 1995.
In 2004 an Arabic-language manual, which carried the logo and address of the Brandbergen Mosque, was spread on the internet. The manual described the construction of simple chemical weapons, including how to build a chemical munition from an ordinary artillery round.
On December 7, 2006, the Swedish citizen Mohamed Moumou, who is described by the United States Department of the Treasury as an "uncontested leader of an extremist group centered around the Brandbergen Mosque in Stockholm", was put on the United Nations Security Council Committee 1267 list of foreign terrorists.
Investigative journalism uncovers discrimination against women.
The SVT program Uppdrag granskning "(Mission: Investigation)" visited 10 mosques once with a hidden camera and once with a visible camera. When the representatives were aware of being filmed, they stated that they supported values such as gender equality. However, when two undercover journalists posed as Muslim women with difficulties in their marriage, the answers from the majority of the visited imams were different. The imams told the women that they were expected to sleep with their husbands even if they did not want to, that they were to accept being beaten and strongly discouraged them to go to the police. Since about half of the visited mosques receive state or local funding, they are expected to promote basic values of Swedish society, such as equal rights between the gender and to counteract discrimination and violence.

Hovet (band)

Hovet is most known to be the backup band to Swedish singer/songwriter Lars Winnerbäck.
History.
The band was composed of musicians that Winerbäck had worked with through the years and was officially formed in 2003. The band toured with Winnerbäck during 2001 when he recorded his first live record ...Live för dig! and recorded Söndermarken with Winnerbäck in Denmark. When Lars announced to the band that he was planning to record the acoustic album Vatten under broarna Hovet decided to record an album on their own. 
The band moved out to a rented house in Kisa during the winter of 2004 and divided themselves in teams to write music. The band soon had thirteen songs which they brought to Stockholm to record. All of the songs were recorded live with the entire band playing together with very few overdubs. All of the bandmembers then divided the vocals between them, the whole album took five days to record. The records artwork was done by Winnerbäck and the record was released on their own label Hovet Records.
Hovet later joined up to record the Ep Stort liv and later recorded two new songs for Winnerbäcks dubbel disc compilation album Efter nattens bränder as well as tour in support of both records. In 2007 Winnerbäck announced that he was going to record his next album Daugava without Hovet, the only member to participate during the recording was Johan Persson. Winnerbäck claimed that he had to work with new musicians in order not to repeat himself and that he would like to work again with Hovet sometime in the future. Vocalist Idde Shultz also confirmed that it wasn't a permanent break up and that there was no hard feelings between Hovet and Winnerbäck.

<doc id="19718830" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19718830" title="VHF Data Link">
VHF Data Link

The VHF Data Link or VHF Digital Link (VDL) is a means of sending information between aircraft and ground stations (and in the case of VDL Mode 4, other aircraft). Aeronautical VHF data links use the band 117.975 – 137 MHz assigned by the International Telecommunication Union to "Aeronautical Mobile Services (Route)". There are ARINC standards for ACARS on VHF and other data links installed on approximately 14,000 aircraft and a range of ICAO standards defined by the Aeronautical Mobile Communications Panel (AMCP) in the 1990s. Mode 2 is the only VDL mode being implemented operationally to support Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC).
ICAO VDL Mode 1.
The ICAO AMCP defined this Mode for validation purposes. It was the same as VDL Mode 2 except that it used the same VHF link as VHF ACARS so it could be implemented using analog radios before VHF Digital Radio implementation was completed. The ICAO AMCP completed validation of VDL Modes 1&2 in 1994, after which the Mode 1 was no longer needed and was deleted from the ICAO standards.
ICAO VDL Mode 2.
The ICAO VDL Mode 2 is the main version of VDL. It has been implemented in a Eurocontrol Link 2000+ program and is specified as the primary link in the EU Single European Sky rule adopted in January 2009 requiring all new aircraft flying in Europe after January 1, 2014 to be equipped with CPDLC. 
In advance of CPDLC implementation, VDL Mode 2 has already been implemented in approximately 2000 aircraft to transport ACARS messages simplifying the addition of CPDLC. Networks of ground stations providing VDL Mode 2 service have been deployed by ARINC and SITA with varying levels of coverage. 
The ICAO standard for the VDL Mode 2 specifies three layers, the subnetwork, link and physical layers. The subnetwork layer complies with the requirements of the ICAO Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN) standard which specifies an end-to-end data protocol to be used over multiple air-ground and ground subnetworks including VDL. 
The VDL Mode 2 Link Layer is made up of two sublayers, a data link service and a media access control (MAC) sublayer. The data link protocol is based on the ISO standards used for dial-up HDLC access to X.25 networks. It provides aircraft with a positive link establishment to a ground station and defines an addressing scheme for ground stations. The MAC protocol is a version of Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA). 
The VDL Mode 2 Physical Layer specifies the use in a 25 kHz wide VHF channel of a modulation scheme called Digital 8-Phase Shift Keying providing a data rate of 31.5 kilobit/second. This is the highest data rate that can be achieved in a 25 kHz channel with a maximum range of 200 nautical miles. This required the implementation of VHF digital radios.
ICAO VDL Mode 3.
The ICAO standard for VDL Mode 3 defines a protocol providing aircraft with both data and digitized voice communications that was defined by the US FAA with support from Mitre. The digitized voice support made the Mode 3 protocol much more complex than VDL Mode 2. The data and digitized voice packets go in Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) slots assigned by ground stations. The FAA implemented a prototype system around 2003 but did not manage to convince airlines to install VDL Mode 3 avionics and in 2004 abandoned its implementation.
ICAO VDL Mode 4.
The ICAO standard for VDL Mode 4 specifies a protocol enabling aircraft to exchange data with ground stations and other aircraft. 
VDL Mode 4 uses a protocol (Self-organized Time Division Multiple Access, STDMA, invented by Swede Håkan Lans in 1988) that allows it to be self-organizing, meaning no master ground station is required. This made it much simpler to implement than VDL Mode 3.
In November 2001 this protocol was adopted by ICAO as a global standard. Its primary function was to provide a VHF frequency physical layer for ADS-B transmissions. However it was overtaken as the link for ADS-B by the Mode S radar link operating in the 1090 MHz band which was selected as the primary link by the ICAO Air Navigation Conference in 2003. 
The VDL Mode 4 medium can also be used for air-ground exchanges. It is best used for short message transmissions between a large number of users, e.g. providing situational awareness, Digital Aeronautical Information Management (D-AIM), etc.. 
European Air Traffic Management modernization trials have implemented ADS-B and air-ground exchanges using VDL Mode 4 systems. However on air transport aircraft the operational implementations of ADS-B will use the Mode S link and of CPDLC will use VDL Mode 2.

Also Koil is the old name for the city of Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh. Present day Kol Tehsil is a part of Aligarh city that adjoins the area of Grand Trunk Road.
Initial Kol covered not only the city but the entire district of Aligarh.
The origin of the name of Kol is obscure. In some ancient texts, Kol has been referred to in the sense of a tribe or caste, name of a place or mountain and name of a sage or demon.
Ibn Batutah the famous Arab geographer and traveler has written an account of Kol in his travelogue. This was the area where he was robbed of all his possessions and left unclad,

Kim Il-sung

Kim Il-sung (; born Kim Sŏng-ju; 15 April 1912 – 8 July 1994) was the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, commonly referred to as North Korea, from its establishment in 1948 until his death in 1994. He held the posts of Prime Minister from 1948 to 1972 and President from 1972 to his death. He was also the leader of the Workers' Party of Korea from 1949 to 1994 (titled as chairman from 1949 to 1966 and as general secretary after 1966). He invaded South Korea in 1950, and almost succeeded in overrunning the entire peninsula but for UN intervention. The Korean War, sometimes referred to as the Korean Civil War, was stopped with a cease-fire signed on 27 July 1953. As of now, the Korean War has technically not ended.
His tenure as leader of North Korea has often been described as autocratic, and he established an all-pervasive cult of personality. From the mid-1960s, he promoted his self-developed "Juche" variant of socialist organisation, which later replaced Marxism-Leninism as the ideology of the state. In the U.S. Library of Congress Country Study on North Korea in 2009, he was described as "one of the most intriguing figures of the twentieth century". He was in power during the terms of office of six South Korean presidents, seven Soviet leaders, ten U.S. presidents, ten UK Prime Ministers, twenty-one Japanese prime ministers, five popes of the Roman Catholic Church and coincided with the entire apartheid era of South Africa.
His son Kim Jong-il became his formal successor at the 6th WPK Congress, and he succeeded him in 1994. The North Korean government refers to Kim Il-sung as "The Great Leader" (위대한 수령, "widaehan suryŏng") and he is designated in the North Korean constitution as the country's "Eternal President". His birthday is a public holiday in North Korea and is called the "Day of the Sun".
Early life.
Many of the early records of his life come from his own personal accounts and official North Korean government publications, which often conflict with external sources. Nevertheless, there is some consensus on at least the basic story of his early life, corroborated by witnesses from the period.
Kim is reported by some to have been born in the small village of Mangyungbong (then called Namni) on 15 April 1912. Mangyungbong sits on a peak in the Rangrim Range of mountains near Pyongyang, Korea.Indeed, the name "Mangyungbong" means "All Seeing Peak". From Mangyungbong there is a panoramic view of the Daidong River far below, where small steamers can be seen carrying trade from the Western Sea to Pyongyang and back again. Born to Kim Hyŏng-jik and Kang Pan-sŏk, who gave him the name Kim Sŏng-ju; Kim also had two younger brothers, Ch’ŏl-chu (or Kim Chul Joo) and Yŏng-ju.
The exact history of Kim's family is somewhat obscure. According to Kim himself the family was neither very poor nor comfortably well-off, but was always a step away from poverty. Kim claims he was raised in a Presbyterian family, that his maternal grandfather was a Protestant minister, that his father had gone to a missionary school and was an elder in the Presbyterian Church, and that his parents were very active in the religious community. According to the official version, Kim’s family participated in anti-Japanese activities and in 1920 they fled to Manchuria. Like most Korean families, they resented the Japanese occupation of the entire Korean peninsula, which began on August 29, 1910. Another view seems to be that his family settled in Manchuria like many Koreans at the time to escape famine. Nonetheless, Kim’s parents, especially Kim's mother (Kang Ban Suk) played a role in some of the activist anti-Japanese struggle that was sweeping the peninsula. But, their exact involvement - whether their cause was missionary, nationalist, or both - is unclear. Still, Japanese repression of any and all opposition was brutal, resulting in the arrest and detention of more than 52,000 Korean citizens in 1912 alone. The repression forced many Korean families to flee Korea and settle in Manchuria. The whole Kim family fled to Manchuria in 1920.
Communist and guerrilla activities.
There is much controversy about Kim's political career before the founding of North Korea, with some sources indicating he was an imposter. Several sources indicate that the Kim Il-sung name had previously been used by a prominent early leader of the Korean resistance, Kim Kyung-cheon (김경천). Grigory Mekler, who is to have prepared Kim to lead North Korea, says that Kim assumed this name while in the Soviet Union in the early 1940s from a former commander who had died. According to Leonid Vassin, an officer with the Soviet MVD, Kim was essentially "created from zero". For one, his Korean was marginal at best; he'd only had eight years of formal education, all of it in Chinese. He needed considerable coaching to read a speech the MVD prepared for him at a Communist Party congress three days after he arrived.
However, historian Andrei Lankov has stated that the claim that the name Kim Il-sung was switched with the name of the "original" Kim is unlikely to be true. Several witnesses knew Kim before and after his time in the Soviet Union, including his superior, Zhou Baozhong, who dismissed the claim of a "second" Kim in his diaries. Historian Bruce Cumings argues that the assertion Kim was an imposter parallels the North's propaganda that he single-handedly defeated the Japanese. The official version of Kim's guerrilla life is believed to be heavily embellished as a part of the subsequent personality cult, particularly his portrayal as a boy-conspirator who joined the resistance at 14 and had founded a battle-ready army at 19.
The following details of his career are therefore disputed.
In October 1926, Kim founded the Down-With-Imperialism Union. Kim attended Whasung Military Academy in 1926, but when later finding the academy's training methods outdated, he quit in 1927. From that time, he attended Yuwen Middle School in Jilin up to 1930, where he rejected the feudal traditions of older generation Koreans and became interested in Communist ideologies; his formal education ended when he was arrested and jailed for his subversive activities. At seventeen, Kim had become the youngest member of an underground Marxist organization with fewer than twenty members, led by Hŏ So, who belonged to the South Manchurian Communist Youth Association. The police discovered the group three weeks after it was formed in 1929, and jailed Kim for several months.
In 1931, Kim joined the Communist Party of China. (The Communist Party of Korea had been founded in 1925, but had been thrown out of the Comintern in the early 1930s for being too nationalist.) He joined various anti-Japanese guerrilla groups in northern China. Feelings against the Japanese ran high in Manchuria, but as of May 1930 Manchuria was not occupied by the Japanese. On 30 May 1930 a spontaneous violent uprising in eastern Manchuria arose in which peasants attacked some local villages in the name of resisting "Japanese aggression". This unplanned reckless and unfocused uprising was easily put down by the authorities. Because of the attack, the Japanese began to plan an occupation of Manchuria. In a speech before a meeting of Young Communist League delegates on 20 May 1931 in Yenchi County in Manchuria, Kim warned the delegates against such unplanned uprisings as the May 30, 1930 uprising in eastern Manchuria.
Four months later, on 18 September 1931, the "Mukden Incident" occurred in which a relatively weak dynamite explosive charge went off near a Japanese railroad in the town of Mukden in Manchuria. Although no damage occurred, the Japanese used the incident to send armed forces into Manchuria and appoint a new puppet government. In 1935, Kim became a member of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, a guerrilla group led by the Communist Party of China. Kim was appointed the same year to serve as political commissar for the 3rd detachment of the second division, around 160 soldiers. It was here that Kim met the man who would become his mentor as a Communist, Wei Zhengmin, Kim’s immediate superior officer, who was serving at the time as chairman of the Political Committee of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. Wei reported directly to Kang Sheng, a high-ranking party member close to Mao Zedong in Yan'an, until Wei’s death on 8 March 1941.
In 1935 Kim took the name Kim Il-sung, meaning "become the sun".
Kim was appointed commander of the 6th division in 1937, at the age of 24, controlling a few hundred men in a group that came to be known as "Kim Il-sung’s division". It was while he was in command of this division that he executed a raid on Poch’onbo, on 4 June. Although Kim’s division only captured a small Japanese-held town just across the Korean border for a few hours, it was nonetheless considered a military success at this time, when the guerrilla units had experienced difficulty in capturing any enemy territory. This accomplishment would grant Kim some measure of fame among Chinese guerrillas, and North Korean biographies would later exploit it as a great victory for Korea. For their part the Japanese considered Kim to be one of the most effective and popular Korean guerrilla leaders. Kim was appointed commander of the 2nd operational region for the 1st Army, but by the end of 1940, he was the only 1st Army leader still alive. Pursued by Japanese troops, Kim and what remained of his army escaped by crossing the Amur River into the Soviet Union. Kim was sent to a camp near Khabarovsk, where the Korean Communist guerrillas were retrained by the Soviets. Kim became a Major in the Soviet Red Army and served in it until the end of World War II.
Return to Korea.
The Soviet Union declared war on Japan in August 1945. The United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima (6 August 1945) and Nagasaki (9 August 1945), and the Red Army entered Pyongyang with almost no resistance on 15 August 1945. Stalin had instructed Lavrenty Beria to recommend a Communist leader for the Soviet-occupied territories and Beria met Kim several times before recommending him to Stalin.
Kim arrived in the Korean port of Wonsan on 19 September 1945. In December 1945, the Soviets installed Kim as chairman of the North Korean branch of the Korean Communist Party. With backing from the Soviets, he became chairman of the Interim People's Committee on February 8, 1946, making him "the top Korean administrative leader in the North."
To solidify his control, Kim established the Korean People's Army (KPA), aligned with the Communist Party, and he recruited a cadre of guerrillas and former soldiers who had gained combat experience in battles against the Japanese and later against Nationalist Chinese troops. Using Soviet advisers and equipment, Kim constructed a large army skilled in infiltration tactics and guerrilla warfare. Prior to Kim's invasion of the South in 1950, which triggered the Korean War, Joseph Stalin equipped the KPA with modern, Soviet-built heavy tanks, trucks, artillery, and small arms. Kim also formed an air force, equipped at first with Soviet-built propeller-driven fighters and attack aircraft. Later, North Korean pilot candidates were sent to the Soviet Union and China to train in MiG-15 jet aircraft at secret bases.
WPK General Secretary.
Rise and start of cult of personality.
Despite United Nations plans to conduct all-Korean elections, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was proclaimed on 9 September 1948, with Kim as the Soviet-designated premier. In May 1948, the south had declared statehood as the Republic of Korea.
On 12 October, the Soviet Union recognized Kim's government as sovereign of the entire peninsula, including the south. The Communist Party merged with the New People's Party to form the Workers Party of North Korea (of which Kim was vice-chairman). In 1949, the Workers Party of North Korea merged with its southern counterpart to become the Workers Party of Korea (WPK) with Kim as party chairman.
By 1949, Kim and the Communists had consolidated totalitarian rule in North Korea and all parties and mass organizations were either eliminated or consolidated into the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, a popular front but one in which the Workers Party predominated. Around this time, the "cult of personality" was promoted by the Communists, the first statues of Kim appeared, and he began calling himself "Great Leader".
Korean War.
Archival material suggests that North Korea's decision to invade South Korea was Kim's initiative, not a Soviet one. Evidence suggests that Soviet intelligence, through its espionage sources in the US government and British SIS, had obtained information on the limitations of US atomic bomb stockpiles as well as defense program cuts, leading Stalin to conclude that the Truman administration would not intervene in Korea.
The People’s Republic of China acquiesced only reluctantly to the idea of Korean reunification after being told by Kim that Stalin had approved the action. The Chinese did not provide North Korea with direct military support (other than logistics channels) until United Nations troops, largely US forces, had nearly reached the Yalu River late in 1950. At the outset of the war in June and July, North Korean forces captured Seoul and occupied most of the South, save for a small section of territory in the southeast region of the South which was called the Pusan Perimeter. But in September, the North Koreans were driven back by the US-led counterattack which started with the UN landing in Incheon, followed by a combined South Korean-US-UN offensive from the Pusan Perimeter. North Korean history emphasizes that the United States had previously invaded and occupied the South, allegedly with the intention to push further north and into the Asian continent. Based on these assumptions, it portrays the KPA invasion of the South as a counter-attack. By October, UN forces had retaken Seoul and invaded the North to reunify the country under the South. On 19 October, US and South Korean troops captured P’yŏngyang, forcing Kim and his government to flee north, first to Sinuiju and eventually into China.
On 25 October 1950, after sending various warnings of their intent to intervene if UN forces did not halt their advance, Chinese troops in the thousands crossed the Yalu River and entered the war as allies of the KPA. There were nevertheless tensions between Kim and the Chinese government. Kim had been warned of the likelihood of an amphibious landing at Incheon, which was ignored. There was also a sense that the North Koreans had paid little in war compared to the Chinese who had fought for their country for decades against foes with better technology. The UN troops were forced to withdraw and Chinese troops retook P’yŏngyang in December and Seoul in January 1951. In March, UN forces began a new offensive, retaking Seoul and advanced north once again halting at a point just north of the 38th Parallel. After a series of offensives and counter-offensives by both sides, followed by a grueling period of largely static trench warfare which lasted from the summer of 1951 to July 1953, the front was stabilized along what eventually became the permanent "Armistice Line" of 27 July 1953. Over 1.2 million people died during the Korean war.
Chinese and Russian documents from that time reveal that Kim became increasingly desperate to establish a truce, since the likelihood that further fighting would successfully unify Korea under his rule became more remote with the UN and US presence. Kim also resented the Chinese taking over the majority of the fighting in his country, with Chinese forces stationed at the center of the front line, and the Korean People's Army being mostly restricted to the coastal flanks of the front.
Consolidating power.
Restored as the leader of North Korea, Kim returned to the country after war's end and immediately embarked on a large reconstruction effort for the country devastated by the war. He launched a five-year national economic plan to establish a command economy, with all industry owned by the state and all agriculture collectivised. The nation was founded on egalitarian principles intent on eliminating class differences and the economy was based upon the needs of workers and peasants. The economy was focused on heavy industry and arms production. Both South and North Korea retained huge armed forces to defend the 1953 Demilitarized Zone, although no foreign troops were permanently stationed in North Korea. All Chinese troops that fought alongside the North Korean army during the war were removed from North Korea by 1957.
Kim's hold on power was rather shaky. To strengthen it, he claimed that the United States deliberately spread diseases among the North Korean population. While Moscow and Beijing later determined that these charges were false, they continued to help spread this rumour for many years to come. He also conducted North Korea's first large-scale purges in part to scare the people into accepting this false account. Unlike Stalin's Great Purge, these took place without even the formalities of a trial. Victims often simply disappeared into the growing network of prison camps.
During the late 1950s, Kim was seen as an orthodox Communist leader, and an enthusiastic satellite of the Soviet Union. His speeches were liberally sprinkled with praises to Stalin. But Kim sided with China during the Sino-Soviet split, opposing the reforms brought by Nikita Khrushchev, who he believed was acting in opposition to Communism. He distanced himself from the Soviet Union, removing mention of his Red Army career from official North Korean history, and began reforming the country to his own radical Stalinist tastes. Kim was seen by many in North Korea, and in some parts elsewhere in the world, as an influential anti-revisionist leader in the communist movement. In 1956, anti-Kim elements encouraged by de-Stalinization in the Soviet Union emerged within the Party to criticize Kim and demand reforms. After a period of vacillation, Kim instituted a purge, executing some who had been found guilty of treason and forcing the rest into exile.
By the 1960s, Kim's relationship with the great communist powers in the region had become difficult. Despite his opposition to de-Stalinization, Kim never severed his relations with the Soviet Union. He found the Chinese unreliable allies due to the unstable state of affairs under Mao, leaving the DPRK somewhere in between the two sides. The Cultural Revolution in China prompted Kim to side with the Soviets, the decision reinforced by the policies of Leonid Brezhnev. This infuriated Mao and the anti-Soviet Red Guards. As a result, the PRC immediately denounced Kim's leadership, produced anti-Kim propaganda, and subsequently began reconciliation with the United States.
Later rule.
At the same time, Kim reinstated relations with most of Eastern Europe's communist countries, primarily Erich Honecker's East Germany and Nicolae Ceauşescu's Romania. Ceauşescu, in particular, was heavily influenced by Kim's ideology, and the personality cult that grew around him in Romania was very similar to that of Kim. Kim and Albania's Enver Hoxha (another independent-minded Stalinist) would remain fierce enemies and relations between North Korea and Albania would remain cold and tense up until Hoxha's death in 1985. Although not a communist, Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko was also heavily influenced by Kim's style of rule. At the same time, Kim was establishing an extensive personality cult. North Koreans were taught that Kim was the "Sun of the Nation" and could do no wrong. Kim developed the policy and ideology of Juche (self-reliance 주체 사상) rather than having North Korea become a Soviet satellite state.
In the mid-1960s, Kim became impressed with the efforts of North Vietnam's Hồ Chí Minh to reunify Vietnam through guerilla warfare and thought something similar might be possible in Korea. Infiltration and subversion efforts were thus greatly stepped up against US forces and the leadership that they supported. These efforts culminated in an attempt to storm the Blue House and assassinate President Park Chung-hee. North Korean troops thus took a much more aggressive stance toward US forces in and around South Korea, engaging US Army troops in fire-fights along the Demilitarized Zone. The 1968 capture of the crew of the spy ship USS "Pueblo" was a part of this campaign.
A new constitution was proclaimed in December 1972, under which Kim became President of North Korea. In 1980, he had decided that his son Kim Jong-il would succeed him, and increasingly delegated the running of the government to him. The Kim family was supported by the army, due to Kim Il-sung’s revolutionary record and the support of the veteran defense minister, O Chin-u. At the Sixth Party Congress in October 1980, Kim publicly designated his son as his successor.
From about this time, North Korea encountered increasing economic difficulties. The practical effect of "Juche" was to cut the country off from virtually all foreign trade to be entirely self-reliant. The economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping in China from 1979 onward meant that trade with the moribund economy of North Korea held decreasing interest for China. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, during 1989–1991, completed North Korea's virtual isolation. These events led to mounting economic difficulties as Kim refused to issue any kind of economic or democratic reforms.
As he aged, starting in the late 1970s, Kim developed a calcium deposit growth on the right-back of his neck. Its close proximity to his brain and spinal cord made it inoperable. Because of its unappealing nature, North Korean reporters and photographers, from then on, always shot and filmed Kim while standing from his same slight-left angle to hide the growth from official photographs and newsreels, which became an increasingly difficult task as the growth reached the size of a baseball by the late 1980s.
To ensure a full succession of leadership to his son and designated successor Kim Jong-il, Kim turned over his chairmanship of North Korea's National Defense Commission- the body mainly responsible for control of the armed forces as well as the supreme commandership of the country's now million-man strong military force, the Korean People's Army to his son in 1991 and 1993.
So far, the elder Kim remained as the country's president, general-secretary of its ruling communist Worker's Party of Korea and the chairman of the Party's Central Military Commission- the party's organization that has supreme supervision and authority over military matters.
In early 1994, Kim began investing in nuclear power to offset energy shortages brought on by economic problems. This was the first of many "nuclear crises". On 19 May 1994, Kim ordered spent fuel to be unloaded from the already disputed nuclear research facility in Yongbyon. Despite repeated chiding from Western nations, Kim continued to conduct nuclear research and carry on with the uranium enrichment program. In June 1994, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter travelled to Pyongyang for talks with Kim. To the astonishment of the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency, Kim agreed to stop his nuclear research program and seemed to be embarking upon a new opening to the West.
Death.
By the early 1990s, North Korea was isolated from the outside world, except for limited trade and contacts with China, Russia, Vietnam and Cuba. Its economy was crippled by huge expenditures on armaments, and the agricultural sector was unable to feed its population. At the same time, the state-run North Korean media continued to praise Kim.
On 8 July 1994, at age 82, Kim Il-sung collapsed from a sudden heart attack. After the heart attack, Kim Jong-il ordered the team of doctors who were constantly at his father's side to leave, and for the country's best doctors to be flown in from Pyongyang. After several hours, the doctors from Pyongyang arrived, and despite their efforts to save him, Kim Il-sung died. After the traditional Confucian Mourning period, his death was declared thirty hours later.
Kim Il-sung's death resulted in nationwide mourning and a ten-day mourning period was declared by Kim Jong-il. His funeral in Pyongyang was attended by hundreds of thousands of people flown from all over North Korea. Kim Il-sung's body was placed in a public mausoleum at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where his preserved and embalmed body lies under a glass coffin for viewing purposes. His head rests on a traditional Korean pillow and he is covered by the flag of the Workers' Party of Korea. Newsreel video of the funeral at Pyongyang was broadcast on several networks, and can now be found on various websites.
Personal life.
Kim Il-sung married twice. His first wife, Kim Jong-suk, gave birth to two sons and a daughter. Kim Jong-il was his oldest son. The other son (Kim Man-il, or Shura Kim) of this marriage died in 1947 in a swimming accident and his wife Kim Jong-suk died at the age of 31 while giving birth to a stillborn baby girl. Kim married Kim Sung-ae in 1952, and it is believed he had three children with her: Kim Yŏng-il (not to be confused with the former Premier of North Korea of the same name), Kim Kyŏng-il and Kim Pyong-il. Kim Pyong-il was prominent in Korean politics until he became ambassador to Hungary. Since 1998 he has been ambassador to Poland.
Kim was reported to have other illegitimate children, as he was well known for having numerous affairs and secret relationships. They included Kim Hyŏn-nam (born 1972, head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Workers' Party since 2002).
Cult of personality and legacy.
There are over 500 statues of Kim Il-sung in North Korea. The most prominent are at Kim Il-sung University, Kim Il-sung Stadium, Mansudae Hill, Kim Il-sung Bridge and the Immortal Statue of Kim Il-sung. Some statues have been reported to have been destroyed by explosions or damaged with graffiti by North Korean activists. "Yŏng Saeng" ("eternal life") monuments have been erected throughout the country, each dedicated to the departed "Eternal Leader", at which citizens are expected to pay annual tribute on his official birthday or the commemoration of his death. It is also traditional that North Korean newlyweds, immediately after their wedding, go to the nearest statue of Kim Il-sung to lay flowers at his feet.
Kim Il-sung's image is prominent in places associated with public transportation, hanging at every North Korean train station and airport. It is also placed prominently at the border crossings between China and North Korea. Thousands of gifts to Kim Il-sung from foreign leaders are housed in the International Friendship Exhibition.
According to R.J. Rummel, an analyst of political killings, Kim's regime perpetrated over 1 million democidal killings through concentration camps, forced labor, and executions.
Works.
Kim Il-sung was the author of many works which are published by the Workers' Party of Korea Publishing House, such as the 100-volume "Complete Collection of Kim Il Sung's Works" ("김일성전집") and his "Selected Works". These include new year speeches, and other speeches delivered on different occasions. Shortly before his death, he also published an autobiography entitled ""With the Century"" in 8 volumes.
According to official North Korean sources, Kim Il-sung was the original writer of "The Flower Girl", a revolutionary theatrical opera, which was adapted into a film in 1972.
Kim Il-sung hosted a radio broadcast called "Go All Out For Victory in the War".

Congregation B'nai Israel (Sacramento, California)

Congregation B'nai Israel (בני ישראל in Hebrew) is the oldest Jewish congregation in Sacramento, California. The congregation, which began as an Orthodox community, traces its history back to the gold rush of 1849, when Jewish settlers gathered to observe the high holy days. The congregation purchased its first building at 7th and L streets on September 2, 1852, making it the first congregationally owned synagogue west of the Mississippi River.
History.
Locations.
The congregation has survived the destruction caused by fires and floods throughout its history. In November 1852, fire destroyed its original location at 7th and L streets, and it met in congregants' homes until 1858. A Methodist congregation had constructed a building on their former lot during this time, and in 1858 B'nai Israel purchased this new building. Three years later, it too was destroyed by fire. In 1864, the congregation purchased a former Presbyterian concert hall on 6th street for use as their synagogue. In 1904, the congregation moved to 1421 Fifteenth Street, which also caught fire in 1912, and reopened after a year of renovations. This location was home to B'nai Israel until 1954, when the congregation moved to its current location at 3600 Riverside Boulevard. Through the next few decades, the campus expanded to include the Harry M. Tonkin Memorial Chapel, the Sosnick Library, and the Buddy Kandel education wing.
Roots of other synagogues.
Between 1858 and 1861, a splinter group, calling itself B'nai Ha'Shalom had formed due to differences of opinion. The groups reunited in 1861 following floods that damaged the Bet Shalom cemetery. In 1879, the congregation turned from Orthodoxy to Reform, affiliating with the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in 1885. The more Orthodox members left to form Sacramento's Mosaic Law Synagogue. In 1970, members left the congregation to form Temple Beth Shalom in protest to the firing of the congregation's cantor.
1999 fires.
On June 18, 1999, Sacramento congregations B'nai Israel, Beth Shalom and Knesset Israel Torah Center were set ablaze by Matthew Williams and Tyler Williams, causing over a million dollars in damages. B'nai Israel sustained over $800,000 in damage, the most of three synagogues, having damaged its sanctuary and destroyed its library. Undeterred, the congregation met at the Sacramento community center that same evening for Shabbat services, and days later held a rally that drew over 5,000 people from the larger community. The arsonists later murdered Gary Matson and Winfield Mowder on July 1, 1999. This was the second time that the congregation had been victim of a hate crime, as in 1993, the synagogue was firebombed by a 17 year old white supremicist.

Uncle Sam

Uncle Sam (initials U.S.) is a common national personification of the American government that, according to legend, came into use during the War of 1812 and was supposedly named for Samuel Wilson. The first use of Uncle Sam in literature was in the 1816 allegorical book ""The Adventures of Uncle Sam in Search After His Lost Honor"" by Frederick Augustus Fidfaddy, Esq. An Uncle Sam is mentioned as early as 1775, in the original "Yankee Doodle" lyrics of the Revolutionary War. It is not clear whether this reference is to Uncle Sam as a metaphor for the United States, or to an actual person named Sam. The lyrics as a whole clearly deride the military efforts of the young nation, besieging the British at Boston. The 13th stanza is:
Earlier personifications.
The earliest known personification of what would become the United States was "Columbia" who first appeared in 1738 and sometimes was associated with Liberty. With the American Revolutionary War came "Brother Jonathan" as another personification and finally after the War of 1812 Uncle Sam appeared.
Evolution.
The term Uncle Sam is reputedly derived from a Samuel Wilson, a meat packer from Troy, New York, who supplied rations for the soldiers. There was a requirement at the time for contractors to stamp onto the food they were sending, their name and where the rations came from. Wilson's packages were labeled “E.A – US.” When someone asked what that stood for, a coworker joked and said “Elbert Anderson (the contractor) and Uncle Sam,” referring to Sam Wilson, though it actually stood for United States.
As early as 1835 Brother Jonathan made a reference to Uncle Sam implying that they symbolized different things: Brother Jonathan was the country itself while Uncle Sam was the government and its power.
By the 1850s the name Brother Jonathan and Uncle Sam were being used nearly interchangeably to the point that images of what had been called "Brother Jonathan" were now being called Uncle Sam. Similarly, appearance of both personifications varied wildly. For example, one depiction of Uncle Sam in 1860 depicted him looking like Benjamin Franklin, (an appearance echoed in "Harper's Weekly'"s June 3, 1865 "Checkmate" political cartoon) while the depiction of Brother Jonathan on page 32 of the January 11, 1862 edition "Harper's Weekly" looks more like the modern version of Uncle Sam (except for the lack of a goatee).
However, even with the effective abandonment of Brother Jonathan (i.e. Johnny Reb) near the end of the Civil War, Uncle Sam didn't get a standard appearance until the well-known "recruitment" image of Uncle Sam was created by James Montgomery Flagg (inspired by a British recruitment poster showing Lord Kitchener in a similar pose). It was this image more than any other that set the appearance of Uncle Sam as the elderly man with white hair and a goatee wearing a white top hat with white stars on a blue band, a blue tail coat and red and white striped trousers.
The image of Uncle Sam was shown publicly for the first time, according to some, in a picture by Flagg on the cover of the magazine "Leslie's Weekly", on July 6, 1916, with the caption "What Are You Doing for Preparedness?" More than four million copies of this image were printed between 1917 and 1918.
While Columbia had appeared with either Brother Jonathan or Uncle Sam her use as personification for the USA had declined in favor of liberty and once she became the mascot of Columbia Pictures in the 1920s she was effectively abandoned.
Flagg's image also was used extensively during World War II during which the U.S. was codenamed 'Samland' by the German intelligence agency Abwehr. The term was central in the song "The Yankee Doodle Boy", which in 1942 was featured in the musical "Yankee Doodle Dandy".
There are two memorials to Uncle Sam, both of which commemorate the life of Samuel Wilson: the Uncle Sam Memorial Statue in Arlington, Massachusetts, his birthplace; and a memorial near his long-term residence in Riverfront Park, Troy, New York. Wilson's boyhood home can still be visited in Mason, New Hampshire. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery, Troy, New York.
In 1989, "Uncle Sam Day" became official. A Congressional joint resolution designated September 13, 1989 as "Uncle Sam Day" (birthday of Samuel Wilson).

Jacob Bright

[[File:Jacob Bright, Vanity Fair, 1877-05-05.jpg|thumb|"the Apostle to the Women". Caricature by Spy 
published in Vanity Fair in 1877.]]
Jacob Bright (26 May 1821 – 7 November 1899) was a British Liberal politician.
Life and career.
Bright was born at Green Bank near Rochdale, Lancashire. He was the fourth of eleven children of Jacob Bright and Martha Wood. His father was a Quaker and had established a cotton-spinning business at Fieldhouse. His elder brother, John Bright, was a radical politician, and his sister, Priscilla Bright McLaren, campaigned for women's rights. 
Jacob Bright was educated at the Friends School in York before entering the family business of John Bright & Brothers, cotton-spinners. Bright and his brother Thomas managed the firm, and by 1885 the business had expanded into carpet manufacture. He was also responsible for introducing the linotype machine to England.
Bright became involved in radical politics and supported Chartism. He was the first mayor of Rochdale on the town's incorporation as a municipal borough. He stood for election in 1865 in Manchester. Although unsuccessful on his first attempt, he won a by-election in 1867, and held his seat at the general election in 1868. He lost his seat at the 1874 general election, but was returned to parliament at the by-election in 1876. When the three-seat Parliamentary Borough of Manchester was divided into eight single-seat constituencies in 1885, Bright was selected as the Liberal candidate for the new Manchester South West constituency. He was defeated in 1885, but successful in the general election in 1886. As a member of parliament, Bright was considered an "advanced radical". He was a peace campaigner and supported women's suffrage. 
Bright remained as MP for South West Manchester until in 1895. Upon retirement, Bright was sworn into the privy council at the suggestion of Lord Rosebery.
In 1855, Bright married Ursula Mellor, daughter of a Liverpool merchant. Ursula Mellor Bright was a campaigner for women's rights. They had three children.
Jacob Bright died at midnight on 7/8 November 1899 at his residence, "Nunn's Acre", Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. He was cremated without a funeral service. The central committee of the Society for Women's Suffrage passed a resolution recognising his contribution to the movement.

National Register of Historic Places listings in Chisago County, Minnesota

This is a list of the National Register of Historic Places listings in Chisago County, Minnesota. It is intended to be a complete list of the properties and districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Chisago County, Minnesota, United States. The locations of National Register properties and districts for which the latitude and longitude coordinates are included below, may be seen in an online map.
There are 18 properties and districts listed on the National Register in the county. A supplementary list includes three additional sites that were formerly listed on the National Register.
History.
Chisago County's National Register properties reflect its role as an early focus of Euro-American settlement in Minnesota and its evolving land use. An intensive logging industry beginning in the 1830s gave way to agriculture, spurred by railroad access and increased European immigration—particularly Swedish immigration—by the 1870s. Several properties reflect the prosperity achieved by several individuals of this period in the county's booming trackside towns. Around the beginning of the 20th century, Chisago County developed a modest resort and tourism industry.

Bethmanns and Rothschilds

The House of Bethmann and the House of Rothschild were the two great banking dynasties of Frankfurt am Main. For several decades their affairs were closely intertwined while they carried on a vigorous rivalry. On occasion they would cooperate—as business partners but also, not least thanks to the pro-emancipation outlook of Simon Moritz von Bethmann, with the shared goal of enfranchising the Jews of Frankfurt.
Historical background.
Ever since the discriminatory Decretals of Pope Gregory IX in the High Middle Ages, Jews in the Holy Roman Empire had led a precarious existence, condemned to a status of perpetual servitude by Church doctrine and imperial decree, confined to narrow, unhealthy ghettos, and threatened by outbreaks of mob violence when the Jews came in handy as scapegoats. At long last this began to change towards the end of the 18th century. Besides the French revolution and its call for equality and freedom, liberalizing influences came from the changes agreed by the Vienna Congress. In Frankfurt, these were augmented by the 1820 constitution for the Grand Duchy of Hesse, and from the specific provisions concerning Jews in the supplement to the Frankfurt constitution and the Frankfurt council decree of 1824.
Similar traditions.
Both the Bethmann family and the Rothschilds could be said to "come from money". The Bethmanns had been tax collectors and involved in minting or managing money since their origins in 15th-century northern Germany. Mayer Amschel's father had been a foreign currency trader and pawnbroker and he first gained access to the Prince of Hesse by catering to his penchant for rare coins.
The rapid rise of the banking firm of "Gebrüder" (= Brothers) "Bethmann" after its founding in 1748 made the Bethmann family gulden millionaires – one of the richest families in Frankfurt during the second half of the 18th century. In a sense the brothers Bethmann – Johann Philipp, Simon Moritz and Johann Jakob – prefigured the model of "brothers co-operating internationally" perfected half a century later by the five sons of Mayer Amschel. The Rothschilds made up for their later start by becoming even richer and more powerful during the first half of the 19th century than the Bethmanns had ever been.
Together the two families provided the second major push of three that occurred over four centuries in Frankfurt's commercial history. The first – two centuries earlier – had been the influx of Calvinist refugees from the counter-reformation in the southern Netherlands, the third came after World War II when Germany's three biggest banks moved their headquarters to Frankfurt.
As seen by writers.
Egon Caesar Conte Corti.
Like snapshots, two quotes from Egon Caesar Conte Corti highlight the great strides made by the Rothschilds in a very short timespan. The first is a glimpse at the beginnings of the Rothschilds' rise. The year is 1794, but as yet "Gebrüder Bethmann" are too powerful for the upstart to break into the game.
The second, from 1820, shows what a difference a few decades make.
The shock of the bigoted burgomaster was shared by many of his contemporaries, who were unhappy with the advances minorities in Germany were making.
Johann Philipp Freiherr von Bethmann.
Following in the footsteps of his famous ancestor Simon Moritz, Johann Philipp Freiherr von Bethmann in 1994 praised Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his sons for their achievements. The occasion was Hans Sarkowicz' book "Die großen Frankfurter", in which well-known Frankfurt personages were invited to describe notable citizens of Frankfurt and their achievements.
In his essay for the book, Bethmann notes the initial rivalry between the two Houses as bankers to the Landgrave and Elector of Hesse, which however soon gave way to preferment of Rothschild. Simon Moritz von Bethmann at first found this setback hard to take and complained about the aggressive style of doing business exhibited by the Rothschilds.
Eventually, however, he came to express respect for Mayer Amschel's five sons: 
At the time of Mayer Amschel's birth, Frankfurt's Jews were still "serfs" in "slavery", as Ludwig Börne said, not mincing his words. Since the reign of Frederick II in the 13th century, they were "servants of the Imperial treasury". In spite of being restricted to a narrowly circumscribed range of retail, moneylending or pawnbrokerage businesses, a number of families managed to become prosperous by the end of the 18th century, foremost the "Speyer" family. Rothschilds had been small-scale peddlers, and Mayer Amschel himself had been a moderately successful retailer, a dealer in bills of exchange as well as a more traditional court Jew. When Mayer Amschel died in 1812 he was a fully enfranchised citizen of Frankfurt. The walls of the ghetto had come down and he had laid the groundwork for the rise of his family to world renown.
The speed and breadth of the Rothschilds' rapid rise is something that even historians today find difficult to explain.
Börne described Mayer Amschel thus: 
When Prince William became the sovereign in 1785, Mayer Amschel reinforced his activities in his direction, aided by his ally Buderus, the man who held the Landgrave's purse strings. Mayer Amschel's young sons supported him increasingly, aiding the House of Rothschild's rise to fortune. The two older sons Amschel Mayer and Salomon Mayer probably made partner in 1796. In 1800 they and their father, at the latter's request, became imperial court factors, based on their deliveries to the army. In 1802 Mayer Amschel attained the appointment of his sons as masters of the war payroll, and in 1803 he himself rose to the post of court agent in Kassel where he maintained a branch office.
The Landgrave (since 1803 Elector) was one of the richest rulers of the age thanks to the "English subsidies", i.e., the sale of his subjects as soldiers. He invested the profits by turning them into loans, for which he accepted interest from creditors in the form of bills of exchange. From 1801 Rothschild took an ever greater part in the dealings of the Landgrave. Trade in government bonds had now gained in importance; there were bond issues for Denmark, Hessen-Darmstadt, Kurbaden, and the Johanniterorden. But Mayer Rothschild also entered into financial transactions with the Princes of Ysenburg, Büdingen and Thurn und Taxis.
What boosted Rothschild's fortunes, however, was the managing of the exiled Elector's assets. Mayer Amschel transferred liquidity to Nathan in England who advised that the Elector's "getaway money" be invested in English government bonds. In 1807 finally Mayer Amschel was the sole banker to the Elector. In 1806 Karl Theodor von Dalberg became Prince primate of the Rheinbund and lord of Frankfurt, from 1810 as Grand Duke. Mayer Amschel quickly adapted and entered into a relationship with Dalberg. He lent him money for his extravagant lifestyle and financed his journey to Paris in 1810 to attend the wedding of Napoleon and Marie Louise. This earned his youngest son Jacob (James) a residency permit for Paris. In addition Dalberg warned Rothschild when his connection to the absconded Elector became a threat for Rothschild. At the same time Simon Moritz von Bethmann also maintained a most cordial relationship with Dahlberg.
Frankfurt's Jews had greeted Dalberg's instatement in 1806 with high hopes but at first they were disappointed. It was only in 1811 that they received the legal status of citizens. However, as Paul Arnsberg writes in his book, "Geschichte der Frankfurter Juden", 
For the Grand Duchy, emancipation meant that it would lose the annual protection money from the Jews, which it could ill afford. Therefore a "tax commutation payment" was determined, and the Jews of Frankfurt had to purchase their freedom with 440,000 gulden. The Israelitic Community nominated a committee of five men to handle the matter, one of them being Mayer Amschel. In addition Rothschild procured the cash amounts that the Community was unable to raise through the discounting of bills of exchange, including the second installment in the form of debentures with a term of ten years, a major tranche of which was handled by the "Gebrüder Bethmann" bank.
Rothschilds profited from the upheavals and political developments from 1792 onward. Economic policy, the needs of the military, societal reforms and the development of private capitalism all led to a need for more money, so that the function of a banker as debt intermediary and money procurer became more pronounced. In addition religious tensions decreased, and thus also prejudice against the Jews. However, the major advantage of Mayer Amschel and his sons was that they perceived new business areas quickly and were informed quickly, accurately and comprehensively. This could only be done based on joint action in a framework of mutual trust, which required joint deliberations before each operation. Moreover Mayer Amschel himself had always been very mobile, traveling great distances in postal carriages with secret compartments.
The Freiherr rounds out his account noting the charity of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, who gave to the needy regardless of their creed and was prepared at any time to travel and walk on behalf of those requiring his assistance.
Fritz Stern.
The quote below from Fritz Stern shows that in 1852, the House of Bethmann was still strong enough to be wheeled out as a credible threat when the occasion called for it. The House of Rothschild was then at the pinnacle of its power and influence throughout Europe. Of course, as private banks owned by personally liable shareholder-directors, both were about to be challenged and eventually eclipsed by the new joint-stock banking corporations, such as the Disconto-Gesellschaft.
Simon Moritz von Bethmann, in his own words.
One of the few times that the "Staatsrat" allowed himself to get "hot under the collar". The exasperation he expressed came from a feeling of being squeezed from two sides – his fellow Christians who resented him for working to remove their privileges vis-à-vis the Jews, and the Rothschilds in whom centuries of persecution had embedded suspicion and wariness.
Five years later, Bethmann expressed his thoughts in a less passionate manner in another letter.
Summary.
While the sources do not indicate that Bethmanns and Rothschilds were friends—and while the curiosity and appreciation the Bethmanns expressed for the Rothschilds were not reciprocated in equal measure—in the rough-and-tumble world of international finance, complicated further by the delicate state of Judeo-Christian relations and the burden of history, the keen rivals and (less frequently) gimlet-eyed business partners did manage, as far as can be told, to transform a grudging respect into a more cordial relationship.

United States House of Representatives elections in Indiana, 2006

The 2006 congressional elections in Indiana were elections for Indiana's delegation to the United States House of Representatives, which occurred along with congressional elections nationwide on November 7, 2006. Indiana played a key role in helping Democrats sweep Congress, when three Republican incumbents were defeated; (Chris Chocola, John Hostettler and Mike Sodrel), giving the Democrats a majority of the delegation again. Republicans held a majority of Indiana's delegation, 7-2, before the elections.
District 1.
This district is located in Northwest Indiana and borders Chicago. The district has been one of the most Democratic in Indiana.
District 2.
This district is centered on South Bend, Indiana and the Indiana portion of the Michiana region.
Chocola defeated Tony Zirkle, an attorney, Navy veteran, and frequent candidate, in the Republican primary on May 2, 2006 by 70% to 30%. Zirkle, who said he was "willing to debate the idea of returning the guillotine and lynch mob for those who prey on children under the age of 12", was unable to get Chocola to debate him on that or any other subject.
Donnelly raised about $1.5 million to Chocola's $3.2 million.
A poll released in mid-June by the Donnelly campaign showed Donnelly leading 48% to 38% with 14% undecided. The campaign did not release all of the poll findings.
On August 16, the "Cook Political Report" changed the rating for the race from "Lean Republican" to "Toss-Up", saying "Despite a significant fundraising advantage over Democrat Joe Donnelly, which has helped fuel a barrage of negative attack ads, incumbent GOP Rep. Chris Chocola looks more like an underdog than the frontrunner." Also in August 2006, Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball, a Web site run by the University of Virginia Center for Politics, added the race to their "Ferocious Forty" list of the 40 most competitive House races in the nation.
On November 7, 2006, Chocola lost his congressional seat to Democratic candidate Joe Donnelly, whom Chocola had defeated in 2004. The final tally showed Chocola losing by a 54-46 margin, almost an identical reversal of his fortunes in 2004. The election had a much lower turnout than the previous campaign, and the difference appeared to come in St. Joseph County. Historically a Democratic stronghold, Chocola lost it by only a few hundred votes while cruising to victory in 2004. In 2006, however, Donnelly won the county by nearly 14,000 votes, garnering 58% of the vote in what is by far the most populous county of the district.
District 3.
This district is located in the northeast corner of Indiana and has a large population center in Fort Wayne.
District 4.
This district is located in west-central Indiana. Located within the district is the city of West Lafayette and many suburban towns.
District 5.
This district located mostly north of Indianapolis, including the largest suburbs of Indianapolis in Hamilton County.
District 6.
This district takes in a large portion of eastern Indiana, including the cities of Muncie, Anderson, and Richmond.
District 7.
This election pitted five-term incumbent Democrat Julia Carson against Republican Eric Dickerson. 
Automobile dealer Eric Dickerson is a native of Detroit, Michigan and a graduate of Western Michigan University where he received his B.S. in engineering. Dickerson is a former U.S. Marine Corps officer and served with the HMA 269 Attack Squadron in Jacksonville, North Carolina. He later served in the Indiana National Guard.
Julia Carson had held this Congressional seat based in urban Indianapolis since 1997, and had always won by comfortable margins. Republicans hoped to take the seat in the 2006 elections after redistricting made the 7th slightly more Republican, though Democrats still held the advantage. 
Dickerson ran an aggressive grass-roots campaign, defeating the party-endorsed candidate, Ronald Franklin, and two other candidates in the Republican primary on May 2, 2006. He gained further support as the campaign progressed, with an October poll shocking observers of both parties when it showed Dickerson narrowly leading Carson 45% to 42%. Carson dismissed the poll, saying that she always polled more strongly than expected on election day. She was proven correct, winning her sixth term on November 7, 2006.
This district is in the heart of Central Indiana and encompasses most of Marion County/Indianapolis.
District 8.
Population centers of Evansville and Terre Haute are located within its limits along with numerous other small towns.
District 9.
This district is located in southeast Indiana. Suburbs of Cincinnati and Louisville are located within the district. The largest city is Bloomington followed by; Columbus, New Albany, Jeffersonville, and Clarksville.

St. Elizabeth Health Services

St. Elizabeth Health Services is a private Roman Catholic hospital in Baker City, Oregon, United States. It opened August 24, 1897 as St. Elizabeth Hospital. In 1912, a 115-bed facility was constructed at 2365 4th Street. The hospital moved to its current location on Pocahontas Road in April 1969.
History.
The Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia opened St. Elizabeth Hospital on August 24, 1897, as requested by Archbishop William H. Gross. The hospital was first operated by just three sisters and was located at the corner of Second and Church streets in the former St. Francis Academy, which had also been operated by the sisters. One group to which St. Elizabeth Hospital provided care was the local gold miners. A kind of health insurance was offered to the miners who paid one dollar a month to the hospital. In return, each miner received complete health care services, which made St. Elizabeth Hospital one of the earliest health maintenance organizations in the country. 
In 1912, construction began for a new 115-bed facility that was completed in 1915. During the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, many influenza patients were treated at the hospital, and sisters also went to people's homes to care for them.
National Register of Historic Places.
The Tudor Revival style Old St. Elizabeth Hospital (also known as St. Elizabeth Nursing Home and St. Elizabeth Towers) constructed in 1912 was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on February 21, 1987. Its reference number is 89000047. The building served as a nursing home from 1969 until 1987, when a new nursing home was constructed adjacent to the newer hospital on Pocahontas Road. The old hospital now serves as a condominium and vacation rental complex.
Sister hospitals.
St. Elizabeth was operated by Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI) of Colorado until April 1, 2010. At that time it became a part of Trinity Health and a member of the Saint Alphonsus Health System. Shortly thereafter the name was officially changed to Saint Alphonsus Medical Center - Baker City. Other Saint Alphonsus Health System hospitals include Saint Alphonsus Medical Center - Ontario (previously known as Holy Rosary Medical Center), Saint Alphonsus Medical Center - Nampa (previously named Mercy Medical Center), and Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise, Idaho.

Four Tops

The Four Tops are an American vocal quartet, whose repertoire has included doo-wop, jazz, soul music, R&B, disco, adult contemporary, and showtunes. Founded in Detroit, Michigan as The Four Aims, lead singer Levi Stubbs (born Levi Stubbles, a cousin of Jackie Wilson and brother of The Falcons' Joe Stubbs), and groupmates Abdul "Duke" Fakir, Renaldo "Obie" Benson and Lawrence Payton remained together for over four decades, having gone from 1953 until 1997 without a change in personnel.
Among a number of groups who helped define the Motown Sound of the 1960s, including The Miracles, The Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas, The Temptations, and The Supremes, the Four Tops were notable for having Stubbs, a baritone, as their lead singer; most groups of the time were fronted by a tenor. The group was the main male vocal group for the songwriting and production team of Holland-Dozier-Holland, who crafted a stream of hit singles, including two Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits: "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)" and "Reach Out I'll Be There". After Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in 1967, the Four Tops were assigned to a number of producers, primarily Frank Wilson. When Motown left Detroit in 1972 to move to Los Angeles, California, the Tops stayed in Detroit and moved over to ABC Records' Dunhill imprint, where they continued to have charting singles into the late-1970s. Since the 1980s, the Four Tops have recorded for, at various times, Motown, Casablanca Records and Arista Records. Today, save for the "Indestructible" album (owned by Sony Music Entertainment), Universal Music Group controls the rights to their entire post-1963 catalog (through various mergers and acquisitions), as well as their 1956 single, "Could It Be You".
A change of line-up was finally forced upon the group when Lawrence Payton died on June 20, 1997. The band initially continued as a three-piece under the name The Tops, before Theo Peoples (formerly of The Temptations) was recruited as the new fourth member. Peoples eventually took over the role of lead singer when Stubbs suffered a stroke in 2000 with Ronnie McNeir then joining the group. On July 1, 2005, Benson died of lung cancer with Payton's son Roquel Payton replacing him. Levi Stubbs died on October 17, 2008. Fakir, McNeir, Payton, and Harold "Spike" Bonhart, who replaced Peoples in 2011, are still performing together as the Four Tops. Fakir is now the only surviving founding member of the original group, and Payton is a second-generation member.
History.
Early years.
All four members of the group began their careers together while they were high school students in Detroit. At the insistence of their friends, Pershing High students Levi Stubbs and Abdul "Duke" Fakir performed with Renaldo "Obie" Benson and Lawrence Payton from Northern High at a local birthday party. The quartet decided to remain together, and christened themselves "The Four Aims". With the help of Payton's songwriter cousin Roquel Davis, The Aims signed to Chess Records in 1956, changing their name to "Four Tops" to avoid confusion with The Ames Brothers.
Over the next seven years, The Tops endured unsuccessful tenures at Chess, Red Top, Riverside Records and Columbia Records. Without any hit records to their name, The Tops toured frequently, developing a polished stage presence and an experienced supper club act. In 1963, Berry Gordy, Jr., who had worked with Roquel Davis as a songwriter in the late-1950s, convinced The Tops to join the roster of his growing Motown record company.
Joining Motown.
During their early Motown years, the Four Tops recorded jazz standards for the company's Workshop label. In addition, they filled in time by singing backup on Motown singles such as The Supremes' "Run, Run, Run." The Tops also did backing vocals for Martha and the Vandellas on the 1966 hit "My Baby Loves Me".
In 1964, Motown's main songwriting/production team of Holland-Dozier-Holland created a complete instrumental track without any idea of what to do with it. They decided to craft the song as a more mainstream pop song for the Four Tops, and proceeded to create "Baby I Need Your Loving" from the lyric-less instrumental track. Upon its mid-1964 release, "Baby I Need Your Loving" made it to #11 on the United States Billboard pop charts. However, the song proved to be much more popular on trend-setting radio stations in key U.S. markets; Baby I Need Your Loving was a strong top 10 hit on both WMCA in New York, and WKNR in Detroit—stations watched by radio people all over the country because these stations broke new artists and songs. After the single's success The Tops were pulled away from their jazz material and began recording more material in the vein of "Baby I Need Your Loving."
The first follow-up single, "Without the One You Love (Life's Not Worth While)", missed both the pop and R&B Top 40 charts by only three positions. "Ask the Lonely", released early in 1965, was a Top 30 pop hit and a Top Ten R&B hit, and the from there, the Tops' fortunes began to improve.
Success.
After scoring their first #1 hit, the often-recorded and revived "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)" in June 1965, the Four Tops began a long series of successful hit singles. Among the first wave of these hits were the Top 10 "It's the Same Old Song", "Something About You", "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)", and "Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever". Four Tops records often represented the epitome of the Motown Sound: simple distinctive melodies and rhymes, call-and-response lyrics, and the musical contributions of The Funk Brothers. Holland-Dozier-Holland wrote most of Levi Stubbs' vocals in a tenor range, near the top of his range, in order to get a sense of strained urgency in his gospel preacher-inspired leads. In addition, H-D-H used additional background vocals from female background vocalists The Andantes on many of these songs, to add a high end to the low-voiced harmony of The Tops, with "Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever" being one of the few exceptions ...
August 1966 brought the release of the Four Tops' all-time biggest hit, and one of the most popular Motown songs ever: "Reach Out I'll Be There", which hit #1 on the U.S. pop charts and soon became The Tops' signature song. It was almost immediately followed by the similar sounding "Standing in the Shadows of Love"; its depictions of heartbreak reflected the polar opposite of the optimism expressed in "Reach Out". It was another Top 10 hit for the Tops.
The Top 10 U.S. hit "Bernadette" centered around a man's all-consuming obsession with his lover, continued the Four Tops' successful run into April 1967, followed by the Top 20 hits "7-Rooms of Gloom", and "You Keep Running Away". By now, The Tops were the most successful male Motown act in the United Kingdom (in the United States, they were second to The Temptations), and began experimenting with more mainstream pop hits. They scored hits with their versions of Tim Hardin's "If I Were a Carpenter" in late 1967 (mid-1968 in the U.S.) and the Left Banke's "Walk Away Renée" in early 1968. These singles and the original "I'm In a Different World" were their last hits produced by Holland-Dozier-Holland, who left Motown in 1967 after disputes with Berry Gordy over royalties and ownership of company shares.
Late Motown period.
Without Holland-Dozier-Holland, the quality of the Four Tops' output began to decline and hits became less frequent. The group worked with a wide array of Motown producers during the late 1960s, including Ivy Hunter, Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson, Norman Whitfield and Johnny Bristol, without significant chart success.
Their first major hit in a long time came in the form of 1970's "It's All in the Game", a pop Top 30/R&B Top Ten hit produced by Frank Wilson. Wilson and the Tops began working on a number of innovative tracks and albums together, echoing Whitfield's psychedelic soul work with The Temptations. Their 1970 album "Still Waters Run Deep" was a forerunner of the concept album. It also served as an inspiration for Marvin Gaye's 1971 classic album "What's Going On", the title track of which was co-written by the Tops' Obie Benson.
In addition to their own albums, the Tops were paired with The Supremes, who had just replaced lead singer Diana Ross with Jean Terrell, for a series of albums billed under the joint title "" in 1970, and "The Return of the Magnificent Seven" and "Dynamite!" in 1971. Whilst the albums themselves did not perform well on the charts, "The Magnificent Seven" featured a Top 20 version of Ike & Tina Turner's "River Deep - Mountain High", produced by Ashford & Simpson.
The 1971 single "A Simple Game" featured backing vocals from members of The Moody Blues. The song did not fare well on the U.S. charts, but reached number three on the UK charts.
ABC Records and Casablanca Records.
The Motown company began to change in a number of ways during the early 1970s. Older acts such as Martha and the Vandellas and The Marvelettes were being slowly moved aside or dropped to focus on newer acts such as Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5, Rare Earth, and the now-solo Diana Ross. In addition, the company moved its operations from Detroit to Los Angeles, California, where Berry Gordy planned to break into the motion picture and television industries. In 1972, it was announced that the entire company would move west and that all its artists had to move as well. Many of the older Motown acts, already neglected by the label, opted to stay in Detroit, including The Funk Brothers studio backing band, Martha Reeves, and the Four Tops.
The Tops departed Motown for ABC-Dunhill, where they were assigned to writer-producers Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter and the label's head of A&R, Steve Barri as producer, with The Tops' own Lawrence Payton later also serving as a producer and writer. He also took over lead vocals duties on several tracks.
The group's first release on the new label, "Keeper of the Castle" was their first pop Top 10 hit since "Bernadette" in 1967. Follow-ups included the million-selling "Ain't No Woman (Like the One I've Got)", also a top 10 pop hit and their third R&B number 1, and the Top 20 hit, "Are You Man Enough", (from the movie "Shaft In Africa"). "Sweet Understanding Love"; "Midnight Flower"; and "One Chain Don't Make No Prison" all reached the R&B Top 10 between 1972 and 1974. Two ABC/Dunhill singles, 1974's "I Just Can't Get You Out Of My Mind" and 1975's "Seven Lonely Nights" have become popular tunes in the southeast Beach/Shag Club Dance circuit. 
After the release of "Catfish" (a top 10 R&B hit) in 1976, the hits started to dry up and the Tops left ABC after a largely unsuccessful album recorded in Philadelphia in 1978. The group disappeared from the recording scene until the early 1980s. Signing a deal with Casablanca Records, the Tops made a comeback in 1981 with the #1 R&B hit "When She Was My Girl", which just missed the Billboard Pop Top 10, peaking at # 11. The group also scored a UK Top 10 hit with the record and had another hit there with the follow-up, "Don't Walk Away".
Return to Motown.
By 1983, The Tops had rejoined Motown, and were featured on the company's television special "". One of the highlights of the show was a battle-of-the-bands between The Tops and The Temptations, patterned after similar competitions Berry Gordy had staged during the 1960s. Levi Stubbs and Temptation Otis Williams decided the Temptations/Tops battle would be a good one to take on the road, and both groups began a semi-regular joint tour; as of 2007, the two groups continue to play dates together.
The first of The Tops' albums under their new Motown contract was "Back Where I Belong". A whole side of the album was produced by Holland-Dozier-Holland, including the R&B Top 40 single "I Just Can't Walk Away." Only one more Top album would be released by Motown, 1985's "Magic". 1986's "Hot Nights" was canceled, as the group and the label began to disagree over marketing and musical direction. In 1987, the Four Tops decided to leave Motown again, this time for Arista Records, buying back several masters they had recorded for "Hot Nights". It's not clear how many songs from "Hot Nights" were used for "Indestructible". The 2001 box set "Fourever" only names "Indestructible" itself. Other songs that were intended for "Hot Nights" and appear on "Fourever" are the title track (released as a single), "Red Hot Love" and "The Four Of Us" (previously released outside the USA on a CD single of Loco in Acapulco).
The title track of 1988's "Indestructible" was the group's final Top 40 hit, reaching No. 35. It was also featured in the 1988 science-fiction cop film, "Alien Nation.". Another track "Loco In Acapulco" written and produced by British pop musician, Phil Collins and former Motown composer-producer, Lamont Dozier climbed into the UK Top 10. The Arista contract provided a unique opportunity to pair the group's popular lead singer Levi Stubbs with fellow Arista artist, legendary R&B vocalist Aretha Franklin, who was at the height of her own 1980s hit streak. This pairing resulted in the song "If Ever A Love There Was", which became a popular R&B and Adult Contemporary hit, as well as being featured on the soundtrack of the motion picture "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka."
In December 1988, the Tops had been scheduled to board Pan Am Flight 103 to return to the U.S. for Christmas after completing their European tour. However, they were late getting out of a recording session and overslept, causing them to miss the ill-fated flight which crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland, after a terrorist bomb was detonated on board.
In addition to their own recordings, the Four Tops also worked in the fields of television and motion pictures. The group as a whole performed a song for the 1982 film "Grease 2", and Levi Stubbs performed the vocals for the man-eating plant Audrey II in the 1986 musical film "Little Shop of Horrors"; and the voice of the evil Mother Brain on the Nintendo-based NBC Saturday morning cartoon "" from 1989 to 1991.
Later years.
Since the late-1980s, the Four Tops have focused on touring and live performances, only recording one album, 1995's "Christmas Here With You", released on Motown. On June 20, 1997, 59-year-old Lawrence Payton died as a result of liver cancer, after singing for 44 years with the Four Tops who, unlike many Motown groups, never had a single lineup change until then. At first, Levi Stubbs, Obie Benson, and Duke Fakir toured as a trio called "The Tops". In 1998 they recruited former Temptation Theo Peoples to join the act to restore the group to a quartet. By the turn of the 20th to 21st century, Stubbs had become ill from cancer; Ronnie McNair was recruited to fill in the Lawrence Payton position, and Peoples stepped into Stubbs' shoes as lead singer (Stubbs died on October 17, 2008, at his home in Detroit).
The group was featured in several television specials during this time, including "Motown 45", and several by PBS, including a 50th anniversary concert dedicated to the group (available on DVD). The concert turned out to be bittersweet; it featured a brief appearance of the wheelchair-bound Levi Stubbs, and a memorial to Lawrence Payton, announced by Obie Benson. Benson appeared on one more PBS special and died on July 1, 2005, from lung cancer. The final PBS special, titled "Motown: The Early Years", featured a message of Benson's passing following the credits. Lawrence Payton's son Roquel (real name Lawrence Payton, Jr.) replaced Benson as the new bass (Roquel could be seen in the pledge break interviews of "Motown: The Early Years"). Theo Peoples also left the Tops to form his own group and was replaced by Harold 'Spike' Bonhart as lead singer
The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked them #79 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.
The Four Tops Career Awards.
The Four Tops have won many awards during their long and distinguished career,including the following:
After similar releases in the Motown "Definitive DVD" series on The Miracles, The Temptations, The Supremes, and Marvin Gaye, The Four Tops' Motown Definitive DVD, "Reach Out," was finally released on November 11, 2008.
The Four Tops received "The Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award" as part of the 51st Annual Grammy Awards.
Speaking in January 2010 to noted UK soul writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Fakir confirmed plans for the current "new" Four Tops line-up to release a new album while revealing his personal feelings about the current line-up: "To me the new group is like an extension of the family, because we've all been very close for so many years... Which makes it easier for ME, because I truly miss Lawrence, 'Obie' AND Levi - I'd be lying if I said I didn't - and not one of them could EVER be replaced. But, you know, these new guys do perform well enough for the people to still enjoy the shows and still enjoy the music. So for me it kinda makes it bittersweet. Because, at the end of the day, the legacy is still going on, and I'm very pleased that it IS!"
The Four Tops sang the National Anthem before the start of game 5 for the 2011 ALCS between the Texas Rangers & Detroit Tigers on October 13, 2011 in Detroit, MI. When singing the last line of "The Star Spangled Banner", "...and the home of the brave", they quickly sang the words "Ain't No country Like the One I Got", before singing the last word, "brave". The Four Tops were honored with an induction into the R&B Music Hall of Fame at the Inaugural ceremony held at Cleveland State University's Waetejen Auditorium on Saturday August 17, 2013.

Bivalent chromatin

Bivalent chromatin is chromatin that contains both activating and repressing epigenetic modifications in the same area. Activating chromatin modifications increase the accessibility of the chromatin to RNA polymerase, where repressing modifications decrease the accessibility to RNA polymerase. Usually, these do not both occur at the same location, as it seems they would have countering effects; however in bivalent chromatin, they are both present. The repressing modifications usually take precedence, causing the gene to become inactivated. Once the repressing modifications are removed however, the activating modifications attract transcription machinery, and the gene becomes activated.
Bivalent chromatin is hypothesized to serve a role in genetic imprinting and in development.

Food for the Gods

Food for the Gods (often referred to online as FFTG) is a 2007 Canadian short, science fiction, romance film from award-winning writer/filmmaker H. Scott Hughes. The film stars Yvette Lu and Danny Dorosh as two star-crossed lovers in a plot reminiscent of stories of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith. The film is based on a short story by Patricia C. Hughes. It is set in the year 2057.
Plot.
In the protagonist role, Yvette Lu is "Sheenyana," a beautiful, mystic warrior and member of the fictional Kyontawa tribe—a post-Neolithic tribe of humans residing on a pristine forested world, presumably in the Alpha Centauri star system. In the story, the Kyontawa are the descendents of a highly advanced Asian civilization from Earth's forgotten history, which established a deep-space settlement on what is now Sheenyana's planet. Clearly, that high-tech civilization is no more and the Kyontawa's knowledge of it is limited to their religious mythology of "Bird Gods" who seeded their people from the sky. Their language (subtitled in the film) has similarities to Asian languages of Earth, particularly Japanese. After a NASA expedition lands in Sheenyana’s forest, Sheenyana saves the life of American astronaut Lt. Richard O’Conner (Danny Dorosh). Their connection is immediate and, before long, the two fall into a forbidden affair—the foundation of a cultural clash which will threaten to rip them apart. When Sheenyana’s psychic visions foretell a coming danger from Earth, they lead her to the anguishing conclusion that the only way to save her people may be to sacrifice an innocent man—and the love of her life.
Reception & Production.
Featuring a majority Asian cast, "Food for the Gods" premiered on Canadian cable, Shaw Multicultural Channel, Sunday, May 25, 2008, as part of SMC's and ExplorASIAN's (a Vancouver-based Asian heritage organization) salute to Canada's Asian Heritage Month, which takes place each May. It aired at approximately 10:00 PM Pacific Time as part of a two hour block, 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM (the Sunday Movie of the Week timeslot), under the program title, "Filmmakers Showcase: Roots & Passages"—an anthology of short films selected by ExplorASIAN and Shaw Multicultural Channel for their reflections on Asian history and culture (either historical or fictional). SMC aired an encore of the showcase at Midnight the following morning.
"Food for the Gods" has also been an Official Selection of the 2008 New Asia Film Festival in Richmond, British Columbia, an Official Selection of the 2008 Route 66 Film Festival in Springfield, Illinois, and an Official Selection of the Vancouver Asian Film Festival in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia on November 8, 2008. The film has garnered critical praise. During a May, 2008 Q&A session with three of the film's stars, Yvette Lu, Beverly Wu, and Yuki Morita, panelists at the New Asia Film Festival compared "Food for the Gods" to the romantic feature film, "2046", from acclaimed Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai. The New Asia Film Festival describes "Food for the Gods" on their official Website:
Although it takes place in an otherworldly setting, the film is rich in Asian themes, including a backstory referencing prehistoric Japan, and a fictional subtitled language that is loosely derived from Japanese and other Asian language influences.
It was popular among festival judges at the Route 66 Film Festival for its poignant beauty and musical score, co-composed by the film's director, H. Scott Hughes, and the film's star and postproduction producer, Yvette Lu. The soundtrack features actress and singers Yvette Lu and Beverly Wu, singing in the Kyontawa language, accompanied by Chinese "erhu" master Xu Qian of the University of British Columbia's Asian Music Studies Department. On September 18, 2008, "Food for the Gods" was the only Route 66 Film Festival selection to appear on the front cover of "A&E," a publication of The State Journal-Register of Springfield, Illinois. "Food for the Gods" first premiered October 19, 2007 at the Vancouver International Film Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia.
FFTG was shot on Super 16 film, using Arriflex Cameras and Lenses, digitized and color corrected by Technicolor Laboratories, under the supervision of Director of Photography Steven Ye and cinematography advisor Ricky Choi. It displays in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio in 5.1 surround sound, mixed by Doug Woods at the VFS Sound Design studios in Vancouver.
Continuity with "Crazy Old Woman".
This film takes place in the same fictional universe as "Crazy Old Woman", a previous short film written by H. Scott Hughes and directed by FFTG producer, Joe Fang. FFTG character Dr. Denise Hanson (Tara Pratt) is presumed to be granddaughter of Stewart and Terri Hanson, the characters featured in "Crazy Old Woman". Denise Hanson, in "Food for the Gods", also meets a fate somewhat similar to her one of her ancestors in the previous film, which is set in the present (fifty years prior). H. Scott Hughes, who directed "Food for the Gods" and also wrote both films, has referred to this as the Hanson Family Curse. The plots are, otherwise, unrelated.
"Megami: Legacy for the Gods" and "Megami: Search for the Gods" (Sequels).
Sees Far Pictures has announced the completion of principal photography of two separate sequel shorts, shot back to back, titled Megami: Legacy for the Gods and Megami: Search for the Gods, respectively. The release dates of both are currently unspecified. The producers refer to the independent short films as two separate "teasers" for a potential larger project, possibly a TV series, down the road. Both films, set seven years after events of the first film (placing the year at c.2064), again star Yvette Lu as protagonist "Sheenyana." Lu also serves as Executive Producer of both films, with H. Scott Hughes returning as Writer, Director, and Executive Producer. The teaser poster also gives above title billing to Beverly Wu, reprising her role as Princess Xionko, and Tomoko Hanawa in the title role as "Kyshiyo - the Megami." "Megami: Search for the Gods" introduces a new heroine from Earth, Canadian Air Force Maj. Denise Hinoki, played by Grace Chin.
Megami: Legacy for the Gods
"Megami: Legacy for the Gods" features international action star Stephen M.D. Chang, playing the film's primary villain, Kanukami. A brief synopsis on the film's website makes reference to Sheenyana anguishing over the actions she was forced to take at the end of the previous film—as she and Xionko must now secure technologies, including advanced weapons and a starship, left behind by the Earth astronauts. A rival tribe called the Tokono has amassed an army upon Kyontawa lands, led by Kanukami (Chang), the same man responsible for the deaths of Sheenyana's parents when she was a child. Kanukami's daughter, Shan'li (Caroline Chan), is the first to attack Sheenyana in an attempt to make a name for herself and find favor with her demanding father. Meanwhile, Sheenyana is also being psychically visited by a female ghost named "Kyshiyo" (Tomoko Hanawa) a beautiful "Megami," (Princess Goddess) who once ruled Sheenyana's planet when it was part of an advanced interstellar empire, 20,000 years ago. Danny Dorosh, Shaker Paleja, and Tara Pratt reprise their roles as the original "Eagle III" astronauts from "Food for the Gods." Also returning is Taka Hiro as the Kyontawa king, Shogoto. The poster's tag line reads, "On an Alien World... When a Goddess dies, who will replace her?" The plot synopsis, and participation of Stephen M.D. Chang, best known for his action roles in film and television implies a more action oriented plot for the sci-fi film, compared to the more romance driven plot of the previous film. "Megami: Legacy for the Gods" is co-produced by Rainfield Films, Inc. in Canada.
Set partly on Earth, "Megami: Search for the Gods" stars a new character named Maj. Denise Hinoki, M.D. (Grace Chin), a member of the Canadian Forces. While attempting to discover what became of her astronaut friends from the lost "Eagle III" mission seven years ago, Major Hinoki uncovers an international conspiracy, which somehow threatens Sheenyana's planet, as well as the Major's own life. Tara Pratt (who played Dr. Denise Hanson in both "Food for the Gods" and "Megami: Legacy for the Gods") returns to a different role, playing a villainous twin sister, Dr. Theresa Hanson, who will ultimately engage in a gun-slinging action showdown with the Major, according to the film's released production stills. Yvette Lu, Beverly Wu, Tomoko Hanawa, Taka Hiro, and Yuki Morita all return to their previous roles from "FFTG" and/or "Legacy." Nik Green, also a producer on the film, co-stars as a black ops mercenary, Codename: The Artist. The film's website specifically acknowledges the oddly similar names of Dr. Denise Hinoki and the previous Dr. Denise Hanson (from "Food for the Gods" and "Megami: Legacy for the Gods"), which may imply some sort of interwoven destiny yet to play out. "Megami: Search for the Gods" is co-produced by Global Authority Films in Canada.
Additional Revelations
Both sequels specifically name Sheenyana's planet as Alpla Centauri - Alpha II, which may mean the second planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A. Production stills from both films also display an "updated" look for members the Kyontawa tribe. While maintaining continuity with "Food for the Gods," both "Megami" films show a tribe that is less Pre-Columbian in appearance and attire and more reminiscent of early Asian medieval. For example, Sheenyana's prominent feathers from the first film are now subtly replaced with a single metallic feather symbol worn on a necklace to denote her faith in "Wakandan Tori" (the Bird Gods). She wears a Chinese-inspired leather armor and wields a Japanese style katana sword, instead of a wooden dagger. She does, however (according to the captions on a series of production stills), make an appearance in her original FFTG costume during a flashback sequence set during the era of the first film—and her original wooden dagger can seen on her belt along with her current katana. Other “updates” to the Kyontawa include the riding of horses and utilization of guns and advanced Earth technologies left behind by the "Eagle III" crew. Princess Xionko (once again played by Beverly Wu) appears to have made a dramatic shift from a spoiled and selfish teen-aged princess in "Food for the Gods" to a matured and heroic warrior in both "Megami" films.
Although not appearing in either "teaser" short, the producers maintain that future installments of "Megami/For the Gods" will feature appearances by Method Fest Best Supporting Actress Nominee Giovannie "Pico" Espiritu, best known to TV audiences as medical intern Ludlow on NBC's "ER", playing Sheenyana's late mother, Ichigo.

Patrick Lundborg

Patrick Lundborg (born 1967) is a writer on psychedelic culture and author of the books "Psychedelia" and "The Acid Archives". Lundborg has a bachelor of science degree in information science from Stockholm University, with additional studies in classic philosophy and the history of religion. Lundborg is an original member of the Lumber Island Acid Crew, a psychedelic artist collective which formed in Stockholm in the mid-1980s and remains active up to the present time.
Works.
Essays and monographs.
With special focus on psychedelic music and culture, Lundborg has written numerous magazine articles and CD liner notes within the field. Among his earlier works are "The Age Of Madness" (1992), a guide to 1960s garage compilations and 45s, and "13th Floor Elevators–The Complete Reference File" (1999, 2002). In recent years, Lundborg’s writings have also appeared in magazines such as "Ugly Things" (US), "Shindig!" (UK), "Flashback" (UK), "Misty Lane" (Italy), "Fenris Wolf" (Sweden) and "The Wire" (UK). The Lysergia website that he launched in 2001 and continues to maintain receives 10-15.000 visitors each month. Patrick Lundborg's non-music writings include essays on Ken Kesey and The Merry Pranksters, Terence McKenna, Mel Lyman, The Human Be-In, the heritage from Eleusis in Shakespeare's The Tempest and the Renaissance, Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" and Alan Watts.
"The Acid Archives".
"The Acid Archives", Lundborg’s first major work, went through four printings in the original 2006 edition. The book documents and reviews 4.000 underground LPs from the US and Canada, 1965–1982, and has been favorably reviewed in leading music magazines such as "Mojo" and "The Wire". In 2010, a Second Edition of "The Acid Archives" book (ISBN 9197652318) appeared, printed in color and expanded to 400 pages. The book is currently still in print, and now also available as a downloadable digital e-book.
"Psychedelia".
In 2012, Lundborg's latest and largest writing project was launched with the publication of "Psychedelia - An Ancient Culture, A Modern Way Of Life" (Lysergia 25-12, ISBN 9789197652322). Unlike Lundborg's earlier works, the "Psychedelia" book is expanded to cover a much wider field than music. Psychedelic culture is traced from its beginnings with the hallucinogenic celebrations at Eleusis 2500 years ago, acknowledging in parallel the ancient shamanic plant drug cultures of South America and Mexico. A permanent alternative spiritual culture of the West is outlined as Lundborg follows the impulse from Eleusis through the Neoplatonism and pantheism of the Middle Ages, the rise of hermeticism and esoteric alchemy during the Renaissance, up to the highly visible psychedelic scenes of the modern world. Certain representative works and artists are selected for detailed analysis, such as William Shakespeare's "The Tempest", Francis Coppola's "Apocalypse Now", William Blake, Eden Ahbez, the 13th Floor Elevators, the Mel Lyman Family, Terence McKenna, Grateful Dead, Philip K Dick, Father Yod & The Source Family, and several more. Broader cultural developments given close scrutiny include the ayahuasca religions of Amazonia, the rich hallucinogenic culture of the Aztec, the 1960s Haight-Ashbury scene, the 1970s interest in homegrowing psilocybin mushrooms, the Electronic Dance Music scenes of acid house, Goa PsyTrance and Psybient, and several more.
Psychedelic philosophy and the purposeless play.
A psychedelic philosophy drawn from classic Platonism and the modern phenomenology of Husserl and Merleau-Ponty is presented as a foundation for a modern psychedelic lifestyle. Lundborg links the German phenomenologist Eugen Fink's notion of life as 'play' with the 'purposeless play' advocated by John Cage and Alan Watts, thereby expanding the phenomenological stance into an approach to life in general. The higher spiritual world which emerges in the peak states of the psychedelic experience can be seen reflected in the joys and wonders of nature and everyday life. Repeat exposure will cause the development of a hedonistic-pantheistic lifestyle, where like-minded individuals congregate in enclaves or 'tribes' for shared psychedelic celebrations. This "double positive" of mundane joy and transcendental bliss is found expressed in many key psychedelic works. Lundborg puts this spiritual lifestyle in contrast with the Abrahamic religions that came to dominate the West as Plato's mystic individualism and the psychedelic initiations at Eleusis fell out of favor.
Unified Psychedelic Theory.
The last chapters of "Psychedelia" examine the need for and difficulties in mapping out the "Innerspace" of psychedelic experiences, and discusses several ways in which this could be done, along with the presentation of a generalized "trip model" that outlines the stages and thematic contents of a typical psychedelic journey. A speculative explanatory model for the bizarre, yet frequently recurring visionary experiences available via high-dose tryptamine drugs like DMT, ayahuasca and psilocybin is presented, based on the latest theories in neurophenomenology and bio-evolutionary research. Lundborg's Unified Psychedelic Theory (UPT) ties together the unbiased, phenomenological approach to psychedelic states with anthropologist Michael Winkelman's neuropsychological model of altered consciousness and Paul MacLean's triune brain, and adds a suggestion that several of the more enigmatic aspects of the higher psychedelic states can be explained via residuals of ancient evolutionary responses to genetic matter of a cosmic origin, what is known as panspermia. The UPT hypothesis solves several lingering questions around the recurring contents of the psychedelic experience, the tryptamine spectrum in particular.

<doc id="19719119" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19719119" title="Twink (gay slang)">
Twink (gay slang)

Twink is a gay slang term describing a young or young-looking man with a slender, ectomorph build, little or no body hair, and no facial hair. In some societies, the terms "fox", "plum", "chick", or "chicken" are preferred. The related term "twinkle-toes", which implies that a man is effeminate, tends to be used in a derogatory manner. The terms can be complimentary or pejorative.
Origin.
The term's namesake is the "golden-colored phallic-shaped snack cake" Hostess Twinkie, commonly regarded as the quintessential junk food: "little nutritional value, sweet to the taste and creme-filled." "Cream" is among the well-known food-related euphemistic terms for semen. In "Queering Pornography: Desiring Youth, Race and Fantasy in Gay Porn", essayist Zeb J. Tortorici notes that gay twink porn thrives on the production and performance of "consumable and visually/anally receptive masculinity."
A twink is "memorable for his outer packaging", not his "inner depth". The golden color also alludes to those who are excessively sun tanned. The tanned, "blond California surfer" had been popularized from the mid-1970s to the 1980s, which ushered in the notion of the gay male as physically muscular, clean-cut, and following a wellness-oriented lifestyle, concerned with nutrition, fitness, stress, and their environment.
The junk food reference has a number of connotations, including a perceived lack of intelligence and being ideal only for a short term, but not having lasting qualities or being very healthy. Most of these concerns no longer apply, as the definition of "twink" has broadened, and qualifiers (such as "muscle" or "femme") narrow the meaning to a more specific type of twink.
Usage.
Twinks are often clean-shaven to emphasize a youthful, fresh-faced appearance. The term has been used by bears in a derogatory and pejorative manner. In some cases, it is a neutral descriptive term, and can be contrasted with "bear". The term is often modified by various descriptors, e.g., "femme twink", "Euro twink" and "muscle twink". The term is often used in the gay porn industry.
There is a backronym that states that "twink" stands for "teenaged, white, into no kink", although these criteria are neither necessary nor sufficient to allow one to be classified as a twink.
Twink code.
Similar to other "codes", like the bear code, the "twink code" is a set of symbols using letters, numbers, and other characters commonly found on modern, Western computer keyboards, and used for the describing and rating of twinks. These codes are used in email, Usenet, and Internet forum postings to identify the physical type and preferences of the poster but have mostly fallen out of usage. The code includes physical traits such as "c" for color of hair (from blond to black), "l" for length of hair (from bald/clean-shaven to very long),
"h" for degree of hairlessness, "y" for youthful appearance, and "e" for endowment. It also includes personality traits such as "q" for "queeniness" and sexual preferences such as "k" for "the kinky factor".

<doc id="19719124" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19719124" title="Selim Aga">
Selim Aga

Selim Aga (born around 1826 in Taqali area of Sudan, died December 1875 in Liberia), a native of Sudan who was abducted by slave traders when he was eight years of age, was brought to Scotland in 1836, and raised and educated as a free man. Selim wrote an autobiography of his life as a slave, accompanied by his poetic "Ode to Britain" and printed in Aberdeen in 1846. He regularly lectured in Great Britain on the African topics, and in 1857 left with William Balfour Baikie for an expedition of the Niger River. Later he accompanied John Hawley Glover and Richard Francis Burton on their African expeditions. In late 1860s Selim relocated to Liberia, probably aspiring for presidency; he was killed by Grebo insurgents in 1875.
Childhood.
Selim Aga, according to his own account, was born in Taqali valley controlled by a chief whose main possessions were the "three" wells. The people of Taqali practised primitive agriculture and sheepherding, their faith combined Islam with pagan Sun worship. Selim, the oldest boy in the family, was prepared by the father to plow his own farmland; he was abducted by slaveholders when herding the livestock. He and his fellow prisoners were forced to march away from Taqali, relayed between numerous Sudanese, Arab and Turkish gangs of slaveholders. After six months' service to one exceptionally vicious slaveholder, Selim was taken over by a new owner (his seventh) who set up a caravan heading to Dongola. After a brief stay there, Selim was sold again; he ended up on a slave market in Cairo. His ninth master was a European (identified as "Mr. P" in Selim's book); his tenth was Robert Thurburn ("Mr. R. T."), British consul in Alexandria. The new owners taught Selim basic English, took him on a tour of the Cataracts of the Nile, and then prepared for the journey to Britain via Malta, Messina, Naples and the land route to Dover Strait.
Scotland and London.
Selim was placed in the custody of consul Thurburn's brother John in Peterculter near Aberdeen, baptised, educated at home and in a local school. In 1846 he published autobiographical "Incidents Connected with the Life of Selim Aga", written in "faultless idiomatic English"; it was reissued in 1850.
In 1875, the year of Selim's death, his memoirs published in the Geographical Magazine stirred up the public who did not believe that the book was written by an African and not an educated British gentleman. Richard Francis Burton came to his former steward's defence, confirming that Selim was, in fact, an African educated in Scotland, and capable of "... briefly anything... he took all the trouble of life off my hands."
His life between 1846 and 1857 remains scarcely documented, but it is known that he fathered at least one son with a local woman. Selim's living descendants from this affair have been traced in Scotland and the United States. After leaving the Peterculter home in 1846 Selim resurfaced as a lecturer on the "Panorama of the Nile" at the Great Exhibition of 1851; he petitioned Lord Palmerston for "Amelioration of Africa", promoted an idea of a trans-African east-west railroad to facilitate commerce, and was given an audience at the Foreign Office.
African expeditions.
In 1857 Selim Aga sailed with William Balfour Baikie on an expedition up the Niger River; he was placed under command of lieutenant John Hawley Glover and accompanied the latter on a dangerous journey to Lagos to help the survivors of a shipwreck. He attempted to lead a search-and-rescue for the vanished expedition led by Eduard Vogel, but was superseded by Baikie. Since 1860 Selim Aga was in the service of Richard Francis Burton, who regularly praised Selim's assistance and experience.
Death.
Selim Aga spent at least nine last years of his life, 1866–1875, in Liberia. He was engaged in searching for mineral resources, surveying the previously unknown Cavallo River valley. Selim's arrival in Liberia coincided with the beginning of clashes between inland native Africans and the coastal immigrants from the United States. In 1871 secretary of state, Edward Wilmot Blyden, was forced into exile; president, Edward James Roye, was deposed by the mob. Selim was murdered four years later, at a time when he served as an assistant surgeon and was not involved in active politics. According to an obituary published in "Liberian Independent" December 23, 1875, the Grebo mob leader allowed him time for a Christian prayer, then "chopped his body all over, cut off his head, which he took to his town, and threw the body with a gift a Bible into the field."

Teletubbies say &quot;Eh-oh!&quot;

'Teletubbies say "Eh-oh!"' is a hit single which was number one in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in December 1997. It remained in the Top 75 for 29 weeks after its first release and three weeks more after two re-releases and sold well enough to be certified as double-platinum. It is mostly a remix of the theme song from the hit BBC TV show, "Teletubbies". It was also a massive hit in the Republic Of Ireland, peaking at number two. The Teletubbies have not had another such hit, making them a one-hit wonder. The song also reached #13 in The Netherlands, remaining in the Dutch Singles Chart for 13 weeks. The song contains two nursery rhymes, the Teletubbies hum along to Baa, Baa, Black Sheep and the flowers from Teletubbyland sing Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary.
Christmas race.
There was considerable anticipation that it would be the Christmas number one in 1997 and it was the betting favorite at William Hill at odds of 6–4. This race was said to have been decided by the under-10 age group as the rival Spice Girls were popular with seven-year old girls while the Teletubbies were more popular with younger children. Siobhan Ennis, the singles manager at Tower Records' flagship store in Piccadilly Circus said, ""The race for the Christmas No 1 is really exciting. At this time of year, people aren't being so serious about their purchasing. We've taken a hell of a lot of the Teletubbies record. The singles market is driven by children, and not just at Christmas."" The Teletubbies were beaten by the Spice Girls' Too Much and so were just the Christmas number two. The outcome of this close race may be incorrectly recalled, however. For example, a year later, the BBC was embarrassed when its answer to a pop quiz had the Teletubbies as the Christmas number one.
Marketing.
BMG marketed the single in the UK while EMI managed it for the rest of Europe. A&R executive Simon Cowell made this deal with the BBC saying, ""I heard another record label were about to sign the Teletubbies, so I got the BBC in my office and told them I would give them £500,000 in advance. We knew a record like that would make over £2 million."" It then sold 317,000 copies in its first week to debut at number one; 1,103,000 copies by the end of the year and total UK sales were 1.3 million.
A rival single, "Tubby Anthem", was made by Yorkshire musician Vince Brown for the charity ChildLine. The BBC threatened legal action and so it was withdrawn.
Reception.
Teletubbies say "Eh-oh!" was number one in the UK singles chart for two weeks in December 1997. It remained in the Top 75 for 29 weeks after its first release and 3 weeks more after two re-releases. The single was shortlisted for the Novello songwriting award but others consider it to be an annoying tune—sickly and irritating. It has repeatedly placed high in polls of awful songs, such as that run by VH1 in which it placed third to The Millennium Prayer and Mr Blobby. As of November 2012, the song is currently the 83rd biggest selling single in UK singles chart history.

2000–01 Football League Cup

The 2000–01 Football League Cup (known as the Worthington Cup for sponsorship reasons) was the 41st season of the Football League Cup, a knockout competition for England's top 92 football clubs. The competition name reflects a sponsorship deal with Worthington Brewery.
The competition began on 22 August 2000, and ended with the final on 25 February 2001 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff as Wembley Stadium was in the process of being rebuilt.
The tournament was won by Liverpool, who beat Birmingham City 5–4 on penalties after a 1–1 draw after extra-time. Robbie Fowler put Liverpool in front after half an hour but a Darren Purse penalty salvaged the game for Birmingham in the final minute of normal time. This was the first of three trophies Liverpool would win during the season, the others being the UEFA Cup and the FA Cup.
First round.
The 70 First, Second and Third Division clubs compete from the First Round. Each section is divided equally into a pot of seeded clubs and a pot of unseeded clubs. Clubs' rankings depend upon their finishing position in the 1999–2000 season. Therefore, the clubs relegated from the Premier League in 2000, Wimbledon, Watford and Sheffield Wednesday, were the top seeds, and the club newly promoted to the Third Division, Kidderminster Harriers, were bottom seeds. The first legs took place on 22 and 23 August and the second legs on 5 and 6 September.
Second round.
The 35 winners from the First Round joined the Premier League clubs not participating in European competition. The ties were played over two legs, with the first legs from 19 to 20 September and the second legs on 26 and 27 September. Two second leg matches were played on 2 October.
Third round.
The 25 winners from the Second Round joined the Premier League clubs participating in European competition in Round Three. Matches were played on 31 October and 1 November.
Fourth round.
The eight matches were played on 28 and 29 November.
Fifth round.
The four matches were played on 12, 13 and 19 December.
Semi-finals.
The semi-final draw was made in December 2000 after the conclusion of the quarter finals. Unlike the other rounds, the semi-final ties were played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The first legs were played on 9 and 10 January and the second legs on 24 and 31 January 2001.
Second leg.
"Liverpool win 6-2 on aggregate."
"Birmingham City win 4–2 on aggregate
Final.
The 2001 Worthington Cup Final was played on 25 February 2001 and was contested between First Division side Birmingham City and Premier League team Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.

United States Senate election in Colorado, 2004

The 2004 United States Senate election in Colorado took place on November 2, 2004 alongside other elections to the United States Senate in other states as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell decided to retire instead of seeking a third term. Democratic nominee Ken Salazar won the open seat.
Background.
On March 3, 2004, incumbent Republican Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell announced that he would not seek reelection due to health concerns, having recently been treated for prostate cancer and heartburn. Before Campbell's retirement, no prominent Democrat had entered the race, with educator Mike Miles and businessman Rutt Bridges pursuing the Democratic nomination. After Campbell's retirement, many expected popular Republican Governor Bill Owens to enter the race, however he declined to run. Campbell's retirement and Owens' decision not to run prompted a number of prominent Democrats to reexamine the race.
Democratic primary.
Campaign.
On March 10, the same day Owens announced he would not run, U.S. Congressman Mark Udall entered the race. The next day, state Attorney General Ken Salazar entered the race, leading Udall to immediately withdraw and endorse him. Salazar lost to Mike Miles at the State nominating convention. In spite of this loss, the national Democratic Party backed Salazar with contributions from the DSCC and promotion of Salazar as the only primary candidate.
Republican primary.
Campaign.
The two candidates got into an ideological battle, as Schaffer attacked Coors because his company had provided benefits to the partners of its gay and lesbian employees, in addition to promoting its beer in gay bars. Coors defended himself by saying that he was opposed to same-sex marriage, and supported a constitutional amendment to ban it, although he noted that he supported civil unions for gay couples. According to the "Rocky Mountain News", Coors described his company's pro-LGBT practices as "good business, separate from politics."
Results.
Coors defeated Schaffer with 61% of the vote in the primary, with many analysts citing his high name recognition in the state as a primary factor. 
General election.
Campaign.
Pete Coors, Chairman of Coors Brewing Company, ran as a moderate conservative. However, Salazar was also a moderate and a highly popular State Attorney General. Coors is also a great-grandson of Adolph Coors, founder of the brewing company. His father is Joseph Coors, President of the company and founding member of the conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation. Salazar narrowly won the open seat. It was one of only two Democratic pickups in the 2004 Senate elections (Illinois was the other).
Finances.
According to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics (CPS), Coors gave his own campaign $1,213,657 and received individual donations of $60,550 from other Coors family members.
A state record total of over $11 million was raised during the election.

Pus

Pus is an exudate, typically white-yellow, yellow, or yellow-brown, formed at the site of inflammation during infection. An accumulation of pus in an enclosed tissue space is known as an abscess, whereas a visible collection of pus within or beneath the epidermis is known as a pustule or pimple.
Pus consists of a thin, protein-rich fluid, known as "liquor puris", and dead leukocytes from the body's immune response (mostly neutrophils). During infection, macrophages release cytokines which trigger neutrophils to seek the site of infection by chemotaxis. There, the neutrophils engulf and destroy the bacteria and the bacteria resist the immune response by releasing toxins called leukocidins. As the neutrophils die off from toxins and old age, they are destroyed by macrophages, forming the viscous pus.
Bacteria that cause pus are called suppurative, pyogenic, or purulent. If the agent also creates mucus, it is called "mucopurulent". 
Despite normally being of a whitish-yellow hue, changes in the color of pus can be observed under certain circumstances. Pus is sometimes green because of the presence of myeloperoxidase, an intensely green antibacterial protein produced by some types of white blood cells. Green, foul-smelling pus is found in certain infections of "Pseudomonas aeruginosa". The greenish color is a result of the bacterial pigment pyocyanin that it produces. Amoebic abscesses of the liver produce brownish pus, which is described as looking like "anchovy paste". Pus can also have a foul odor, particularly pus from anaerobic infections.
In almost all cases when there is a collection of pus in the body, the clinician will try to create an opening for it to evacuate - this principle has been distilled into the famous Latin aphorism "Ubi pus, ibi evacua"
Some common disease processes caused by pyogenic infections are impetigo, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and necrotizing fasciitis.
Pyogenic bacteria.
A great many species of bacteria may be pyogenic. The most commonly found include:

Biorepository

A Biorepository is a biological materials repository that collects, processes, stores, and distributes biospecimens to support future scientific investigation Biorepositories can contain or manage specimens from animals, including humans, and many other living organisms. Vertebrates, invertebrates, arthropods, and other life-forms are just a few of the many classes of living organisms which can be studied by preserving and storing samples taken.
Purpose.
The purpose of a Biorepository is to maintain biological specimens, and associated information, for future use in research. The Biorepository assures the quality, and manages the accessibility and distribution/disposition of the biospecimens in its collection.
Operations.
The four main operations of a Biorepository are; (i) collection (ii) processing, (iii) storage or inventory, and (iv) distribution of biological specimens.
(i) Collection or Accession is the first operation where samples are recorded as having arrived. Today this is typically performed by scanning the sample barcode with a barcode scanning device. Information about the sample is transferred into the laboratory information management system ("LIMS"). Typical data captured would be the origin of the sample and arrival data / time recording in the LIMS.
(ii) Processing of samples is normally a quality tested process that is performed the same way to each of the samples to minimize variation due to sample handling and prepare the sample for storage. The process is usually one that facilitates long-term storage of a particular sample type - for example DNA samples are processed into a salt buffer (aqueous solution) of proper pH to stabilize the DNA for storage.
(iii) Storage and Inventory are where all samples are held prior to being requested via a distribution request. The inventory system is composed of sample holding boxes and the boxes are stored in freezers of various types depending on the sample storage requirements.
(iv) Distribution is the process of retrieving one or more samples from the Biorepository inventory system.

Désert is a novel written by French Nobel laureate writer J. M. G. Le Clézio, considered to be one of his breakthrough novels. It won the Académie française's Grand Prix Paul Morand in 1980.
Plot summary.
Two stories are interwoven. The shorter, which begins and ends the book, is specifically set in 1910–1912 and tells of the last uprising of the desert tribes against the French protectorate of Morocco, mostly as observed by a small boy, Nour. The longer, the story of Lalla, is set in an indefinite time, but obviously after the Second World War. It describes her early life in a Shanty "city" on the edge of an unnamed Moroccan coastal town, and particularly her friendship with "the Hartani" who, like her, originates from the desert tribes. It narrates the time she spends in Marseilles and her eventual return to the shanty city, where she gives birth to the Hartani's child.

3rd Ohio Infantry

The 3rd Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry (or 3rd OVI) was an infantry regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It served in several important campaigns in the Western Theater in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama.
Three-months regiment.
With the outbreak of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to help put down the rebellion. Ohioans responded well, and several new regiments were enrolled for a term of three months, thought to be long enough to end the war. The 4th Ohio was organized at Camp Jackson in Columbus on April 25, 1861, under Isaac Morrow, Colonel, John Beatty, Lieut. Colonel, and J. Warren Keifer, Major. The regiment moved to newly constructed Camp Dennison near Cincinnati on April 28, and served on garrison duty there until June 12, at which time many of the men joined the newly reorganized a three-years' regiment with the same numerical designation. Those three months' men who elected not to join the three-years' regiment were mustered out on July 24.
Three-years regiment.
Early service.
The three-years 3rd OVI was organized at Camp Dennison on June 12, 1861. After a few days of training and drilling, it moved to Grafton, Virginia (now West Virginia) and then on to Clarksburg on June 20–25, where it was attached to the 1st Brigade, Army of Occupation, West Virginia, until September. The regiment saw action in the West Virginia Campaign, capturing the Confederate-held town of Beverly on July 12. They remained on duty in western Virginia through the balance of the year, fighting in several small skirmishes and battles, including the battles of Rich Mountain and Cheat Mountain.
In October, the 3rd OVI was shipped to Louisville, Kentucky, and served for the rest of the war in the Western Theater. After wintering near Elizabethtown, Kentucky, the regiment, then in the army of Ormsby Mitchel, was part of the general advance on Confederate-held Nashville, Tennessee, in February 1863. After occupying the city, the 9th moved toward Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in March. It took part in the Tullahoma Campaign and assisted in capturing the city of Huntsville, Alabama, on April 11. The 3rd Ohio remained in Alabama until late August when it was part of the Union forces that pursued Braxton Bragg's Confederate army during the Kentucky Campaign.
On October 8, 1862, the 3rd Ohio was heavily involved at the Battle of Perryville. Two weeks later, it marched back to Murfreesboro and remained there through the winter, participating in the Battle of Stones River at year's end. 
In April 1863, the regiment was part of Streight's Raid to Rome, Georgia from April 26 until May 3. It was involved in fights at Day's Gap, Sand Mountain, and Crooked Creek and Hog Mountain. Much of the regiment was captured on May 3 near Rome and taken as prisoners of war. The officers and men were sent to Belle Isle and Libby Prison. The captives were exchanged later that month and sent northward to Camp Chase in Columbus, Ohio, to reorganize.
In June, the 3rd Ohio helped quell the Holmes County Rebellion, and a month later was involved in the pursuit of Morgan's Raiders. On August 1, the 3rd OVI was transported to Nashville and then on to Bridgeport, Alabama, where it was on guard duty until October. Then, it was part of the Union expedition against Confederates under Nathan Bedford Forrest. On November 27, the regiment was sent to the rear lines to perform garrison duty at Chattanooga, Tennessee, until June 1864. It was then ordered back to Camp Dennison on June 9, where it mustered out June 23, 1864.
During its term of service, the 3rd Ohio lost 4 officers and 87 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 3 officers and 78 enlisted men by disease, for a total of 172 fatalities.

Adjacent to the falls on the north side lies the stone foundation of an 18th-century grist mill operated by the long-defunct Glendale Farm. The farm was established in the early 1770s by a future Revolutionary War veteran named John Rhoads. The initial success of the farm led to the construction of what is now Clark Wright Road, the sole means of accessing the falls by car. The farm was not successful for long however; by 1799 the property was sold and Rhoads was gone.

Wine tasting

Wine tasting (often, in wine circles, simply tasting) is the sensory examination and evaluation of wine. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as sommeliers or buyers for retailers) use a constantly evolving formal terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.
Tasting stages.
The results of the four recognized stages to wine tasting:
– are combined in order to establish the following properties of a wine: 
A wine's overall quality assessment, based on this examination, follows further careful description and comparison with recognized standards, both with respect to other wines in its price range and according to known factors pertaining to the region or vintage; if it is typical of the region or diverges in style; if it uses certain wine-making techniques, such as barrel fermentation or malolactic fermentation, or any other remarkable or unusual characteristics.
Whereas wines are regularly tasted in isolation, a wine's quality assessment is more objective when performed alongside several other wines, in what are known as tasting "flights". Wines may be deliberately selected for their vintage ("horizontal" tasting) or proceed from a single winery ("vertical" tasting), to better compare vineyard and vintages, respectively. Alternatively, in order to promote an unbiased analysis, bottles and even glasses may be disguised in a "blind" tasting, to rule out any prejudicial awareness of either vintage or winery.
Blind tasting.
To ensure impartial judgment of a wine, it should be served "blind" — that is, without the taster(s) having seen the label or bottle shape. Blind tasting may also involve serving the wine from a black wine glass to mask the color of the wine. A taster's judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, price, reputation, color, or other considerations.
Scientific research has long demonstrated the power of suggestion in perception as well as the strong effects of expectancies. For example, people expect more expensive wine to have more desirable characteristics than less expensive wine. When given wine that they are falsely told is expensive they virtually always report it as tasting better than the very same wine when they are told that it is inexpensive. French researcher Frédéric Brochet "submitted a mid-range Bordeaux in two different bottles, one labeled as a cheap table wine, the other bearing a grand cru etiquette." Tasters described the supposed grand cru as "woody, complex, and round" and the supposed cheap wine as "short, light, and faulty." 
Similarly, people have expectations about wines because of their geographic origin, producer, vintage, color, and many other factors. For example, when Brochet served a white wine he received all the usual descriptions: "fresh, dry, honeyed, lively." Later he served the same wine dyed red and received the usual red terms: "intense, spicy, supple, deep."
One of the most famous instances of blind testing is known as the Judgment of Paris, a wine competition held in 1976 where French judges blind-tested wines from France and California. Against all expectations, California wines bested French wines according to the judges, a result which would have been unlikely in a non-blind contest. This event was depicted in the 2008 movie "Bottle Shock".
Another well-publicized double-blind taste test was conducted in 2011 by Prof. Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire. In a wine tasting experiment using 400 participants, Wiseman found that general members of the public were unable to distinguish expensive wines from inexpensive ones. "People just could not tell the difference", said Wiseman, "between cheap and expensive wine".
Vertical and horizontal tasting.
Vertical and horizontal wine tastings are wine tasting events that are arranged to highlight differences between similar wines.
Tasting flights.
Tasting flight is a term used by wine tasters to describe a selection of wines, usually between three and eight glasses, but sometimes as many as fifty, presented for the purpose of sampling and comparison.
Tasting notes.
A tasting note refers to a taster's written testimony about the aroma, taste identification, acidity, structure, texture, and balance of a wine. Online wine communities like Bottlenotes allow members to maintain their tasting notes online and for the reference of others.
Serving temperature.
The temperature that a wine is served at can greatly affect the way it tastes and smells. Lower temperatures will emphasize acidity and tannins while muting the aromatics. Higher temperatures will minimize acidity and tannins while increasing the aromatics. 
WSET recommendations.
The Wine & Spirit Education Trust that administers the Master of Wine program uses the following recommendations for serving temperatures:
Glassware.
The shape of a wineglass can have a subtle impact on the perception of wine, especially its bouquet. Typically, the ideal shape is considered to be wider toward the bottom, with a narrower aperture at the top (tulip or egg shaped). Glasses which are widest at the top are considered the least ideal. Many wine tastings use ISO XL5 glasses, which are "egg"-shaped. Interestingly, the effect of glass shape does not appear to be related to whether the glass is pleasing to look at.
Wine color.
Without having tasted the wines, one does not know if, for example, a white is heavy or light. Before taking a sip, the taster tries to determine the order in which the wines should be assessed by appearance and nose alone. Heavy wines will be deeper in color and generally more intense on the nose. Sweeter wines, being denser, will leave thick, viscous streaks (called "legs" or "tears") down the inside of the glass when swirled.
Process.
There are five basic steps in tasting wine: color, swirl, smell, taste, and savor. These are also known as the "five S" steps: see, swirl, sniff, sip, savor. During this process, a taster must look for clarity, varietal character, integration, expressiveness, complexity, and connectedness. 
A wine's color is better judged by putting it against a white background. The wine glass is put at an angle in order to see the colors. Colors can give the taster clues to the grape variety, and whether the wine was aged in wood.
Characteristics assessed during tasting.
Varietal character describes how much a wine presents its inherent grape aromas. A wine taster also looks for integration, which is a state in which none of the components of the wine (acid, tannin, alcohol, etc.) is out of balance with the other components. When a wine is well balanced, the wine is said to have achieved a harmonious fusion. 
Another important quality of the wine to look for is its expressiveness. Expressiveness is the quality the "wine possesses when its aromas and flavors are well-defined and clearly projected. The complexity of the wine is affected by many factors, one of which may be the multiplicity of its flavors. The connectedness of the wine, a rather abstract and difficult to ascertain quality, describes the bond between the wine and its land of origin (terroir).
Connoisseur wine tasting.
A wine's quality can be judged by its bouquet and taste. The bouquet is the total aromatic experience of the wine. Assessing a wine's bouquet can also reveal faults such as cork taint, oxidation due to age, overexposure to oxygen, or lack of preservatives and wild yeast contamination due to "Brettanomyces" or acetobacter yeasts. Although low levels of "Brettanomyces" aromatic characteristics can be a positive attribute, giving the wine a distinctive character, generally it is considered a wine spoilage yeast.
The bouquet of wine is best revealed by gently swirling the wine in a wine glass to expose it to more oxygen and release more aromatic etheric, ester, and aldehyde molecules that comprise the essential components of a wine's bouquet. Sparkling wine should not be swirled to the point of releasing bubbles.
Pausing to experience a wine's bouquet aids the wine taster in anticipating the wine's flavors. The "nose" of a wine - its bouquet or aroma - is the major determinate of perceived flavor in the mouth. Once inside the mouth, the aromatics are further liberated by exposure to body heat, and transferred retronasally to the olfactory receptor site. It is here that the complex taste experience characteristic of a wine actually commences.
Thoroughly tasting a wine involves perception of its array of taste and mouthfeel attributes, which involve the combination of textures, flavors, weight, and overall "structure". Following appreciation of its olfactory characteristics, the wine taster savors a wine by holding it in the mouth for a few seconds to saturate the taste buds. By pursing ones lips and breathing through that small opening oxygen will pass over the wine and release even more esters. When the wine is allowed to pass slowly through the mouth it presents the connoisseur with the fullest gustatory profile available to the human palate. 
The acts of pausing and focusing through each step distinguishes wine tasting from simple quaffing. Through this process, the full array of aromatic molecules is captured and interpreted by approximately 15 million olfactory receptors, comprising a few hundred olfactory receptor classes. When tasting several wines in succession, however, key aspects of this fuller experience (length and finish, or aftertaste) must necessarily be sacrificed through expectoration.
Although taste qualities are known to be widely distributed throughout the oral cavity, the concept of an anatomical "tongue map" yet persists in the wine tasting arena, in which different tastes are believed to map to different areas of the tongue. A widely accepted example is the misperception that the tip of the tongue uniquely tells how sweet a wine is and the upper edges tell its acidity.
Scoring wine.
As part of the tasting process, and as a way of comparing the merits of the various wines, wines are given scores according to a relatively set system. This may be either by explicitly weighting different aspects, or by global judgment (although the same aspects would be considered). These aspects are 1) the appearance of the wine, 2) the nose or smell, 3) the palate or taste, and 4) overall. Different systems weight these differently (e.g., appearance 15%, nose 35%, palate 50%). Typically, no modern wine would score less than half on any scale (which would effectively indicate an obvious fault). It is more common for wines to be scored out of 20 (including half marks) in Europe and parts of Australasia, and out of 100 in the US. However, different critics tend to have their own preferred system, and some gradings are also given out of 5 (again with half marks).
Expectoration.
Because intoxication can affect the consumer's judgment, wine tasters generally spit the wine out after they have assessed its quality at formal tastings, where dozens of wines may be assessed. However, since wine is absorbed through the skin inside the mouth, tasting from twenty to twenty-five samplings can still produce an intoxicating effect, depending on the alcoholic content of the wine.
Visiting wineries.
Traveling to wine regions is another way of increasing skill in tasting. Many wine producers in wine regions all over the world offer tastings of their wine. Depending on the country or region, tasting at the winery may incur a small charge to allow the producer to cover costs.
It is not considered rude to spit out wine at a winery, even in the presence of the wine maker or owner. Generally, a spittoon will be provided. In some regions of the world, tasters simply spit on the floor or onto gravel surrounding barrels. It is polite to inquire about where to spit before beginning tasting.
Attending wine schools.
A growing number of wine schools can be found, offering wine tasting classes to the public. These programs often help a wine taster hone and develop their abilities in a controlled setting. Some also offer professional training for sommeliers and winemakers. It is even possible to learn how to assess wine methodically via e-learning.
Sensory analysis.
Tasting plays an important role in the sensory analysis (also referred to as organoleptic analysis) of wine. Employing a trained or consumer panel, oenologists may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. Difference tests are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.
Grape varieties.
Wine grape varieties are variously evaluated according to a wide range of descriptors which draw comparisons with other, non-grape flavors and aromas. The following table provides a brief and by no means exhaustive summary of typical descriptors for the better-known varietals.

These Days (Rascal Flatts song)

"These Days" is a song written by Jeffrey Steele, Steve Robson, and Danny Wells, and recorded by American country music group Rascal Flatts on their 2002 album "Melt". Released in June 2002 as that album's first single, the song became the group's first Number One hit on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts in November of that year.
Content.
This song is about a man who unexpectedly crosses paths with a former lover and they tell each other what has happened since they saw each other last. He tells her that since she has gone from his life, most of his time is spent thinking and dreaming about her.
Gary LeVox said of the song, "We knew this was a special song. We’d already completed the album but we dropped a song that we wrote to put this on our album."
Recording.
After the completion of recording for "Melt", the band learned there was money in the recording budget for several more songs. They then recorded "Love You Out Loud" and "These Days" and being so impressed by the latter they replaced a song they wrote from the album with it.
Chart performance.
"These Days" debuted at number 48 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of June 29, 2002.

SEPTA Route 103

SEPTA Trolley Route 103 is a former street car line and current bus route, operated by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) on the outskirts of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Route 103 runs between Ardmore, Pennsylvania and the 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, starting in 1902 as a streetcar line operated by the , then the (PSTC, doing business as "Red Arrow Lines") until converted bus operation to December 1966. SEPTA acquired PSTC and assumed operations of the Red Arrow Lines in January 1970.
Route.
The route begins at a loop around Suburban Square shopping center in Ardmore, then heads west along Montgomery Avenue where it turns left at Woodside Road, crossing under the Paoli/Thorndale Line near Ardmore (SEPTA station), which also serves Amtrak's Keystone Service. After Woodside it takes a left onto Lancaster Avenue While Route 103 is close to Ardmore station in this area, it doesn't have a direct connection to the station.
From Lancaster Avenue, Route 103 is divided. Southbound buses use Rittenhouse Place, East Athens Avenue, and Cricket Avenue to County Line Road. Northbound buses from County Line Road use Ardmore Avenue to Lancaster Avenue. Shortly after the split between Lancaster Avenue and County Line Roads, Route 103 makes a turn onto a private busway known as Hathaway Lane(a.k.a.; Ardmore Busway), where it immediately encounters County Line Road Station, which is little more than a shed. The road was originally right-of way for the trolley rails until it was paved over, which is why some of the old P&W/Red Arrow Line sheds still remain intact. The exception to this is the plexglass bus shelter at Belmont Avenue Station.
Although Hathaway Lane continues to serve as a private road strictly for the Route 103 bus south of Haverford Road, there are some sections that contain parallel roads for residents and the general public. Both the busway and West Hathaway Lane go under Norristown High Speed Line at Ardmore Junction (SEPTA station). Merwood Road Station contains residential parallel roads on both sides of the busway, in the form of both West Hathaway and East Hathaway Lane. East Hathaway is a dead-end street north of Merwood Road and a one-way street between Eagle and Merwood Roads. West Hathaway Lane moves away from the busway at the intersection of Huntington Lane.
Though the Ardmore Busway ends at the intersection of Darby Road & Eagle Road in Oakmont, a "Red Arrow" bus shelter can be found after the intersection on Darby Road. The former trolley right-of-way runs west of Darby Road while the current bus route runs down Darby until making a left turn at Brookline Boulevard in Havertown. From there, the bus heads east and makes a right turn onto Earlington Road as it runs south again through Penfield. When Earlington Road ends at Township Line Road the bus turns left then heads up to 77th Street, then turns right onto 77th Street (City Limits).
Route 103 buses took over SEPTA Route 105 routing from 77th Street & City Avenue to 69th Street Transportation Center. Route 103 then turns left onto Woodbine Avenue then a right onto 75th Street, travels down that street for about 4 blocks, then buses merge into Lansdowne Avenue then make a quick left onto Carrington Road/Victory Avenue. Buses make a left into SEPTA Private Bus Way to terminate at the North Terninal of the 69th Street Transportation Center, a terminal that did not exist when Route 103 was trolley and this is not the original termination point for Route 103 trolleys, they originally came into the West Terminal. The Line as a trolley & bus originally merge into West Chester Pike where it join its counterpartner Route 104 (West Chester Trolley Line), another Red Arrow Bus Lines converted from trolleys in 1954. A mural of a trolley station was painted on a building on the corner where the right-of-way used to exist. From this point both the Routes 103 and 104 buses continue eastward along West Chester Pike until reaching the 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby, the same location they reached when they were trolley lines. Today the North Terminal is also serve by 4 other SEPTA Routes; 30, 65 (Formerly Route E), 105 & 106. And West Terminal continues to serve trolley as the former Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company Media (SEPTA Route 101) & Sharon Hill (SEPTA Route 102) Trolley Lines.

Status paradox

A status paradox can be one of several paradoxes involving "status", in the meaning of either medical state or social status.
Status paradox of migration.
This type of status paradox describes how a migration of peoples can alter the status of these peoples, either higher or lower. It is related to economic inequality between world regions which creates incentives for transnational migrants to transfer resources earned in richer countries to poorer countries and, thereby, to gain buying power and social status. 
An example is a migration of laboring migrants from poorer countries, such as Mexico, Albania or Ghana. Their ability to work is considered qualified by the standards of their home country, but is much diminished in the new country they come to. This causes their social status to drop in their new country of living, while their level of education or training held them in a higher social circle in their country of origin. This type of status inconsistency creates the paradox of the migrants being qualified for two different social classes at the same time, but they can only use each class if they are within the boundaries of where it is relevant. Because of global inequalities in terms of wealth and buying power transnational migrants to which the status paradox applies challenge local middle classes in the sending countries. In several countries of the global south names have emerged to classify these migrants, such as Burgers (Ghana), Bengiste (Côte d'Ivoire) or Modou Modou (Senegal).
Wealth and HIV status paradox.
For higher classes with greater amount of wealth, it is naturally assumed that they will have less of a chance of acquiring infectious diseases because they have the money to stop the spread of such diseases. Meanwhile, lower classes with less wealth will not be able to afford treatments to stop the spread of diseases and might even not be knowledgeable about dangerous diseases that they might be catching, so they are at a higher likelihood of catching and spreading various diseases.
However, this is not the case in Africa with HIV. The upper class, instead, are the ones that have the highest percentage of HIV infection, specifically 15-29 year olds. This creates a type of status paradox, having a "disease of affluence", associated with differing class levels.
Gender and status paradox.
Gender, within the realm of economics and business, has long been a dividing factor in terms of wages and management. The use of humor by women in management is one method of relieving the tension created from women being in charge over men, which is seen as a status paradox.
Lifestyle-health status paradox.
For people in the United States, obesity has been a growing trend. The formation of a healthy lifestyle is a viewpoint that is generally not attributed to Americans. From such increases in weight, diabetes, asthma, and migraines have grown more common. However, offsetting this somewhat, the number of people contracting cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases has been dropping for the age range of Americans that are at a higher likelihood of being obese. This status paradox does not correlate with the evidence that shows such rates should be increasing, not decreasing.

Sicomac is an area in Wyckoff, New Jersey.
The first known human inhabitants of the area were the Lenni Lenape Native Americans who lived north of the Raritan River and spoke a Munsee dialect of Algonquian. Sicomac, said to mean "resting place for the departed" or "happy hunting ground", is an area of Wyckoff that, according to tradition, was the burial place of many Native Americans, including Chief Oratam of the Ackingshacys, and many stores and buildings there are named after the area's name, including Sicomac Elementary School. Most Native Americans had left by the 19th century, although a small group lived near Clinton Avenue until 1939.
It has also been interpreted as "black fish".

George LeMieux

George Stephen LeMieux (; born May 21, 1969) is an American politician who was a United States Senator from Florida from 2009 to 2011. He was Chairman of the Florida-based law firm of Gunster Yoakley & Stewart, P.A. and served as Chief of Staff to Governor Charlie Crist. He also served as Deputy Florida Attorney General and is credited with spearheading Crist's successful campaign for Governor. On August 28, 2009, Governor Crist announced that he would appoint LeMieux as senator, to replace Senator Mel Martinez, who weeks earlier announced he would resign as soon as Crist announced his successor. On April 5, 2011, LeMieux formally announced that he would run against incumbent Democratic Senator Bill Nelson in 2012, but dropped out of the race in June 2012.
Early life and education.
LeMieux was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the son of Karen Ann (née Huckestein) and George Harvey LeMieux, a building contractor and secretary to the company. He grew up in Coral Springs, Florida, and graduated in 1987 from Coral Springs High School. He enrolled at Emory University, where he majored in political science and graduated "magna cum laude", Phi Beta Kappa in 1991. He was Senior Orator that year. He went on to earn his J.D. cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center in 1994. He interned for Congressman E. Clay Shaw, Jr. and U.S. Senator Connie Mack III. In 1994, he joined the law firm of Gunster Yoakley & Stewart P.A. in its Fort Lauderdale office. LeMieux is an AV-rated attorney, and is board certified in business litigation. He continued his practice there for eight years, at which time he left to work in Tallahassee with the Republican Party.
Career.
Public service career.
LeMieux worked closely with Charlie Crist and is credited with being the “maestro” of Crist's campaign for Governor. His friendship with Crist began in the 1990s when Crist was a state senator from St. Petersburg and LeMieux was working to expand the role of the Republican Party in Broward County, which is strongly Democratic.
In 1998, LeMieux ran for the state House, pitted against four-term incumbent Democrat Tracy Stafford. According to the "St. Petersburg Times", during the campaign, he went to more than 10,000 doors in a district drawn to protect a Democrat. He campaigned for better health insurance, leaner bureaucracy and smaller class sizes. ""I remember sitting in classrooms in Broward County with 40 kids in them"", the St. Petersburg Times quoted him as saying. He also backed a $100 limit on the amount of money out-of-state companies could give to Florida candidates as a way of allowing working people to have a bigger impact in the system. Ultimately, he lost the race, but became head of the Republican Party in Broward County.
In 2002, Crist, then attorney general, asked LeMieux to be his chief of staff in the Attorney General’s office, and LeMieux left the firm of Gunster Yoakley to take the position. In 2006 LeMieux was chief of staff for Crist’s campaign for governor, and the Republican team defeated rival Tom Gallagher by 32 points to win the GOP nomination. After winning the nomination, LeMieux, as campaign chief of staff, hired staff members and shaped Crist's message and made key strategic moves. He is credited with demanding lecterns for the second TV debate with Democratic opponent Jim Davis instead of a conference table, and also for deciding that Crist would not accompany President Bush on the day before the election. When asked why Crist was not attending the President's visit to Florida, Karl Rove responded ""just ask George LeMieux"". He also advised Crist regarding the selection of Jeff Kottkamp as a running mate. Crist defeated Davis, and political writers and Crist himself have called LeMieux the “maestro” of the campaign. While in public service, LeMieux assembled a long list of successes, including managing more than 400 lawyers as Deputy Attorney General, leading the compact negotiations with the Seminole Tribe of Florida as Chief of Staff to the Governor, and overseeing all aspects of the Executive Office of the Governor including the Governor’s legislative agenda, policy initiatives and the management of the agencies that report to the Governor. Shortly before leaving public office, he took on the role as Governor Crist’s liaison to the Council of 100, a non-partisan group of high-powered business leaders, noting that Crist wanted him to work with the council to find ways of helping businesses.
Returning to the private sector.
In January 2008, LeMieux returned to the law firm of Gunster Yoakley, residing in both its Fort Lauderdale office and its newer Tallahassee office. Within three months of rejoining, LeMieux was named Chairman of the firm. LeMieux worked as a lobbyist for Florida Power & Light during their push for a $1.3 billion rate hike in 2010.
2012 United States Senate election.
On April 15, 2011, LeMieux announced his candidacy for the United States Senate seat held by Bill Nelson. While running for the seat, LeMieux campaigned on a platform of fiscal responsibility until announcing on June 20, 2012, his decision to drop out of the Florida Senate race. He subsequently endorsed Republican Representative Connie Mack IV.
The LeMieux Center for Public Policy.
On December 7, 2012, LeMieux and Palm Beach Atlantic University President William M.B. Fleming, Jr. announced the creation of the LeMieux Center for Public Policy. According to the University president's announcement, "The LeMieux Center will provide students with opportunities to engage with state and national officials, journalists, authors, academics and other notable thought leaders on issues important to Florida, the United States and the world. The LeMieux Center will host an annual interactive lecture series featuring notable speakers on issues of public policy and servant leadership." According to the University, the LeMieux Center will also offer an independent study program to two PBA upperclassmen starting in the fall semester of 2013. On December 6, 2010, LeMieux announced Palm Beach Atlantic University's Warren Library would house his senatorial papers and memorabilia from his service in the U.S. Senate.
The LeMieux Report.
In February 2008, LeMieux launched "The LeMieux Report", an electronic newsletter in text form and video courtesy of YouTube, offering analysis and commentary on key legal, business and political issues that impact the state’s economy and business community. The report was sent out to a list of corporate movers and shakers on a weekly basis. His last video posted on August 25, 2009 ironically focused on the governor's appointee to the Senate, a pick unbeknownst to LeMieux himself who eventually became Mel Martinez's successor.
""Our goal is to examine the hottest issues of the week that impact Florida business ... s the Governor's Chief of Staff I briefed him every day on the most important issues facing Florida. Now I can share that analysis with Florida's leaders."" LeMieux said he will be able to help readers navigate through important and sometimes complex issues, offering clarity and context. He added ""Business executives are busy people. They don’t have the time to sift through all of the information that inundates today's professional to determine what is most important to their interests. "The LeMieux Report" boils it down and gives them the information they need in a format that’s easy to digest.""
He was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1994 and was board certified in business litigation in 2004. Other court admissions include the United States Supreme Court, United States District Court - Southern District of Florida, Middle District of Florida, Northern District of Florida; the United States Court of Appeals-Eleventh and Federal Circuits.

Among his civic and charitable commitments, LeMieux was the Chairman of the Broward County Republican Party, Chairman of the Jeb Bush Re-election campaign, Republican nominee for the Florida House of Representatives – District 92, and served on the City of Fort Lauderdale Beach Redevelopment Advisory Board. He has been a director for Goodwill of Broward County, as well as Riverwalk, Inc., and a trustee for the Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce. In 2002 he was named one of the 50 Most Powerful People in Broward County by Gold Coast Magazine, and 20 People on the Fast Track by Fast Track Magazine. LeMieux received the prestigious "Pollie" award from the American Association of Political Consultants as the nation's "MVP" in a Republican campaign for 2006. LeMieux served as the Executive Director of the Crist/Kottkamp transition team, and went to lead the Executive Office of the Governor as the Governor's Chief of Staff in 2007.
Senate career.
Senator LeMieux proposed “the 2007 Solution,” a plan to eliminate the deficit by 2013 and cut the national public debt nearly in half by 2020.<br> 
On Thursday, May 13, 2010, the Senate adopted an amendment to the then-pending Financial Regulatory Reform that was authored by LeMieux and Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington. An editorial in the "Wall Street Journal" applauded the LeMieux amendment saying its reforms would "destroy the government-created ratings cartel" and that "Mr. LeMieux wants institutions to do some actual due diligence on the assets they hold instead of simply complying with the law by holding assets with a high rating from S&P." 
LeMieux was involved in the high-profile blockage of President Barack Obama's nominee for U.S. Ambassador to Brazil, Thomas Shannon, who has since been confirmed.
During his time in the Senate, LeMieux was recognized for his record on pro-business and tax reform. He has received several awards including a 93% rating from the National Taxpayer Union and the “Spirit of Enterprise” award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Former Senator LeMieux has sat at the candy desk.
