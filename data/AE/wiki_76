1663 Charlevoix earthquake

The 1663 Charlevoix earthquake occurred on February 5, 1663 in the Canadian province of Quebec, and was assessed to have a moment magnitude of between 7.3 and 7.9. The earthquake occurred at 5:30 p.m. local time and was estimated to have a maximum perceived intensity of X ("Intense") on the Mercalli intensity scale. The main shock epicentre is suggested to have occurred along the Saint Lawrence River, between the mouth of the Malbaie River on the north and the mouth of the Ouelle River on the south. A large portion of eastern North America felt the effects. Landslides and underwater sediment slumps were a primary characteristic of the event with much of the destruction occurring near the epicentral region of the St. Lawrence estuary and also in the area of the Saguenay Graben.
The event occurred during the early European settlement of North America and some of the best recorded first hand accounts were from Catholic missionaries that were working in the area. These records were scrutinized to help determine the scale of damage and estimate the magnitude of the quake in the absence of abundant records from that time period.
Tectonic setting.
The Charlevoix Seismic Zone (CSZ) lies along the St.Lawrence River, northeast of Quebec City. Although eastern Canada has relatively infrequent earthquakes, due to its location away from active plate boundaries, the CSZ is its most active part, with five earthquakes of estimated magnitude of 6 or greater since historical records began. Focal mechanisms for earthquakes in this zone are consistent with rupture on both reverse faults and strike-slip faults of varied orientation. The main structures of the area are faults of the Saint Lawrence rift system that run parallel to the river, formed during the break-up of the supercontinent Rodinia in the late Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic. The greatest seismicity occurs where the rift is overprinted by a ~300 Ma meteorite crater, the Charlevoix impact structure. Most CSZ earthquakes have hypocenters within the Grenvillian basement at depths between 7 and 15 km. Many of the smaller earthquakes do not appear to be located on the rift faults, but within the volumes of rock between them. Larger events lie outside the impact structure and have inferred nodal planes consistent with reactivation of the rift faults. The relatively weak impact structure is interpreted to cause a perturbation of the regional stress field, affecting the stability of the rift faults.
The estimated length of the most active portion of the CSZ was and the fault area was put at . By comparison, the 7 February 1812 New Madrid event, which was thought to have taken place on the Reelfoot fault and was the largest event in that series, had a rupture zone that was less than that of the Charlevoix earthquake and caused chimney damage at distances of more than . These things together suggest that the Charlevoix earthquake was similar in size to the largest of the New Madrid earthquakes and was at least a magnitude 6.8 event. The estimation of the earthquake's intensity was based on the condition of the soil where the damage occurred. A lower magnitude range would be preferred if the soil in the area was soft and loosely compacted and a range based on firm ground or bedrock would be proportionately higher.
Effects.
The earthquake was felt sharply in New England, though the date recorded for the event was 26 January 1663, as New England was using the Julian calendar at the time. A church record entry made by Reverend S. Danforth from Roxbury, Massachusetts (~ 600 km from the CSZ) indicated the initial shock was felt around 6 pm that evening and several more shocks followed the next morning. On the shores of Massachusetts Bay, the tops of chimneys were broken on houses and pewter (a malleable metal alloy) was jarred from shelves. This level of damage is consistent with a modified Mercalli intensity of VI though this may have been because the early colonials had the capability of producing only relatively weak mortar. Using this MMI value and the distance from the epicenter one can estimate the magnitude of the earthquake using published intensity-attenuation relations. In a June 2011 report on the earthquake that was published in the "Bulletin" of the Seismological Society of America, John E. Ebel, a professor and researcher at Boston College, used these known relations that apply to earthquakes in northeastern North America and determined the magnitude to be 7.3 – 7.9.
Great landslides along the Saint Lawrence, Saint-Maurice, and Batiscan Rivers made these rivers muddy after the shock, with the waters of the St. Lawrence being affected for up to one month. Near Trois-Rivières several waterfalls were transformed by these landslides, and one waterfall on the St. Maurice River near Les Grès was said to have been nearly leveled. At Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec, there was a large earthflow landslide in a sensitive clay, interpreted to have been caused by the 1663 earthquake. In 1971 this was the site of another much smaller earthflow that destroyed 41 houses and killed 31 people.
Multibeam bathymetry data and high resolution seismic reflection data acquired in the Saguenay Fjord has been used to identify a series of landslide deposits that were probably triggered by the 1663 earthquake. The Saguenay region is the site of a geological graben and has been subject to several natural disasters since the turn of the seventeenth century. In 1996 it was the site of the largest flood in 20th-century Canadian history, which led to the investigation of the fjord bottom using bathymetric data to determine slope stability.
Historical records.
The inhabitants of the land were the Algonquin and Iroquois people as well as several thousand French settlers. Religious groups like the Ursulines (a Roman Catholic religious institute for women) and the Augustinians left good records of the event. These groups accredited the earthquake to God as a retaliation for disobedience. Some very detailed, though inconsistent, summaries were given by several Jesuits, most notably Jérôme Lalemant who provided relatively reserved written accounts of the strong effects of the earthquake back to his superiors in Europe. Lalemant was said to have been a disciplined priest with diverse experience and following his time in Canada was brought back to France to be posted the provincial superior of the Society of Jesus. Father Charles Simon, on the other hand, was said to have limited training and some written records of his were not received as readily or without hesitation. Father Simon seemed to not be of the same mind as the bulk of the devoted, saying "...the Earthquake was rather a Scheme of Divine Mercy than a scourge of Justice,— especially since, in so great a confusion of affairs and perturbations of the elements, no one lost life or fortune. Fear came to all, penalty to none."
Aftermath.
Immediately after the earthquake, the missionaries, once it had become clear that no lives had been lost, regarded the earthquake not only as a timely warning to the population of New France for their sinfulness, but also as a sign of God's protection. They described it as "miraculous" rather than a disaster, regarding the date of the earthquake as particularly important, coming on the last day of the carnival, just before Mardi Gras. They were pleased to see all the colonists attending church regularly in the following days and that even the traffickers in wine and brandy appeared to repent. These effects were short-lived and Lalemant and other missionaries were soon left wishing for another great earthquake to help them in their cause.

USS Relief (1904)

The fifth USS "Relief" was a lightship that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919. 
"Relief" was built in 1904 as a light vessel for the United States Lighthouse Service, a part of the United States Department of the Treasury. She was employed as one of ten reserve vessels designated "relief", assuming the name of the station lightship she replaced when on station.
This vessel was acquired by the U.S. Navy on 29 August 1918 for World War I service and assigned to the 6th Naval District for service as a lightship.
She was returned to the U.S. Lighthouse Service on 30 August 1919, remaining on its registers through the 1920s.

Toothed seadevil

The toothed seadevil, spiny seadevil or netbeard seadevil, "(Neoceratias spinifer)", is a rarely seen deep-sea anglerfish found in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones of the western central Pacific Ocean. It is the only species in the family Neoceratidae, and is unique amongst the deep-sea anglerfish in lacking an illicium and esca (the "fishing rod" and "lure"), and in having large teeth placed on the outside of its jaws.
Description.
Adult female toothed seadevils have slender, elongate bodies up to long. They are dark red-brown to black in color, with naked skin. The mouth is large and extends well past the small eye; the jaws have an inner row of short, straight, widely spaced, immobile teeth. On the outside of the jaws, there are prominent conical outgrowths that bear 2-3 straight teeth, the longest of which reach almost 15% the length of the entire body. Each of these teeth is hinged at the base, with well-developed musculature and a tiny hook at the end. The illicium, or lure, is absent, along with the trough in which it rests in other deep-sea anglerfishes. There are a pair of prominent nasal papillae on the snout; nostrils and olfactory lamellae are absent.
Both the males and larvae differ from other deep-sea anglerfish in having slender bodies. Mature males are only known from parasitic specimens already attached to the females. The largest known specimen is 18 mm long. They are lighter in color than the females and have semitranslucent skin. They are attached to the females by outgrowths of the snout and lower jaw; the olfactory organs are absent and the eyes are degenerate and covered with skin. The larvae are 4-10 mm long, with well-developed olfactory organs and no sexual dimorphism.
Biology.
With no bioluminescent lure and an unusual tooth arrangement, it is unclear what the toothed seadevil feeds upon and how. It has been suggested that their external jaw teeth serve to entangle soft-bodied invertebrates. The males are fully parasitic, using tooth-bearing denticles at the tips of their jaws to attach to the female and their tissues and blood vessels becoming fused with that of the female.

Quinta Vergara Amphitheater

The Quinta Vergara Amphitheater is an open-air amphitheater within the Parque Quinta Vergara located in Viña del Mar, Chile. The amphitheater is the site of the Viña del Mar International Song Festival held yearly in February. The venue is owned by the Viña del Mar Municipality.
History.
After the success of the first Viña del Mar International Song Festival that took place in 1959, is was accorded to build a stage more stable than the stage which occupied the site at the time. In 1963 the architect Hernando López began the construction of the venue, which would be a wood structure that was like an ¨acoustic shell¨ that helped the artist to project the sound to the audience and to protect the artist from the elements.
In 2002 the Amphitheater was renovated by replacing the wooden shell structure with a concrete structure. This structure is the one that is currently standing. With this renovation, the capacity of the Amphitheater was upgraded from 15,000 to 20,000 (which is the current capacity).

Lewis Charlton (slave)

Lewis Charlton was an American slave who founded a school after his emancipation.
Early life.
Lewis Charlton was born in 1814 on a farm in Frederick County, Maryland. The farm was located between Frederick and Point of Rocks, Maryland. His mother and father were both slaves. His father was sold shortly after the child's birth to a man living in Georgia.
Charlton's first owner was Ignatius Davis who owned Charlton's mother. Davis' wife treated her slaves with severity. She whipped them until they passed out, would wash their wounds with salt water, and have them return to work in the fields. For 14 months, she locked Lewis in a quarter house early each morning until late each night without food, water, companionship, or clothing. Reportedly, on one cold night he kicked his blankets away from his feet, and when his mother returned she found her son’s feet had frozen. Although she replaced the blanket, his toes froze that night and fell off with the blanket the next morning.
When Charlton was seven, Davis died and he was sold to a man who intended to teach him to be a cooper, but before he could begin learning the trade, his new master’s wife died and he was sold again. He was sold to a Mr. Fornistock who was a mean, particularly when he was drunk. Fornistock was a tanner by trade. He had Charlton spread hides that were so heavy he was in danger of falling into the vats. If that occurred be beaten. Eventually Fornistock’s land was sold at a Sheriff's sale.
Lewis was then sold to a Mr. Getinger who expected his slaves to work at all hours of the day, and every day of the week. After 3 years with Getinger, Charlton injured his legs when he was left out in the cold cutting logs for an extended period. Subsequently he was unable to walk for 9 months, and once he was mobile he was sold immediately to a James Davis. Charlton was still only 15 years old.
As Davis’ slave, Lewis endured three years of field labor. His legs were damaged to the point that they bled frequently into his shoes. Three years later, Charlton was sold to a Mr. Richardson. For the first time in his life he was separated from his sister, with whom he had been fortunate to stay with. Charlton remained with Richardson until he 28 years old.
Emancipation.
At 28 he became emanicipated, however, unsure of his future, he chose to live with a stonecutter named George Burroughs. A year later, Charlton moved to Hartford County, Maryland. Here Charlton worked with Isaac Rogers, a large iron manufacturer. Charlton found that he was treated as badly as he had been while a slave, but he continued his employment with Rogers for 16 years. He then moved to the home of William Gladding. He worked as a farmhand for three years, earning a wage of $16 a month, which included the cost of housing. Charlton continued working for Gladding until his marriage. Gladding owed Charlton $235 which he was unable to secure, despite an attempt to sue for his wages in court. Charlton was forced to go return to work. In 1862 Lewis moved to a town named Westminster, where he worked as a mason.
School teacher.
At this point Charlton wanted to educate the young black youth in the surrounding area. Because he lacked the funds to build a school he travelled to Baltimore to raise money. In Baltimore he had a cold reception, so in 1866 he traveled to Boston to raise funds. Here he acquired nearly $1000 and a teacher, named Mr. Whitmore, who was willing to travel to Westminster and teach black children. Finally Charlton established the first Black schoolhouse and church in Westminster. The school prospered for 4 years; for 2 years with Whitmore as teacher, and for 2 years as a woman named Mary Cleveland as teacher. When Charlton's funds were depleted he attempted to raise more but he was unsuccessful. At that point the school was closed.

Marion Downs Sanctuary, a former cattle station, is a nature reserve in the Kimberley region of north-west Western Australia. 
The once privately owned cattle station that occupied an area of had to sell following years of financial hardship and a change in local government boundaries that increased the rates by 800%. Phil Stoker and his partners sold the property for just over 4 million after owning it for 22 years.
It is currently owned and managed by the Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC), by which it was purchased in 2008 with funds from private donors and a 1.8 million grant from the Australian Government. It lies in the Central Kimberley Bioregion and adjoins Mornington Sanctuary, already owned by the AWC. The two sanctuaries combined will form a protected area extending over from north to south, and will be one of the world’s largest privately owned reserves.
Landscape and climate.
The landscape of the reserve is similar to that of Mornington, a mix of tropical savanna woodlands and grasslands, with rugged sandstone escarpments and deep river gorges in the catchment of the Fitzroy River. The climate is tropical and monsoonal with distinct wet (November-April) and dry (May-October) seasons.
Wildlife.

Daye, Hubei

Daye () is a city of eastern Hubei province, People's Republic of China. Administratively, it is a county-level city of Huangshi City.
Before the adoption of the Hanyu Pinyin, the name of the city was often transcribed in English as Tayeh.
As it is usually the case with county-level cities, Daye includes both an urban core and a fair amount of rural land in all directions, with smaller townships ("zhen") such as Dajipu (大箕铺). According to the Fifth Population Census of China (2000), the entire county-level city of Daye had 813,600 residents, with a population density of 558 people per square kilometer.
The Daye Lake south of Daye's urban core is surrounded by parks and fishing ponds, and is a popular place for recreation.
For a traveler who goes on G316 from Wuhan toward the south-east, Daye appears as a border between the more urban and more rural parts of the province. Daye sits on the south-eastern border of the heavily industrialized Wuhan/Ezhou/Huangshi metropolitan area; south of it, the much more rural Yangxin County begins.
Economy.
Daye is an industrial city, a center of mining and metallurgy, both ferrous and non-ferrous; its name means 'Big Smeltery'. 
According to archaeologists, copper mining and smelting was conducted at Daye's Tonglüshan Mine (铜绿山, ) as early as the Spring and Autumn period (6th century B.C.E.), if not earlier. Tonglüshan Mine is located just southwest of the modern city, and now has a museum.
Although such copper-containing minerals as malachite and azurite are found here, the local ores are actually richer in iron than in copper, and the modern Daye is better known for its iron ore mining and processing.
Among the major employers is Huangshi Daye Non-ferrous Metals Co., Ltd.
Transportation.
Daye was the junction of the Wuhan-Daye Railway (completed in 1958) and Daye-Shahejie Railway (completed in 1987), which merged in 1989 to form the Wuhan–Jiujiang Railway. Huangshi Railway Station, which is the main passenger station for the entire Huangshi metropolitan area, is actually located within Daye's administrative borders, about 6 km north of downtown Daye (). It has fairly frequent service, with travel time to Wuhan being typically around 1 hour on a high-speed D-series train, or 1.5 hours on a "conventional" passenger train.
Daye will be served by the Wuhan–Huangshi Intercity Railway, part of the future Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway, which is scheduled to open in 2014. The new Daye North Railway Station will be that line's terminal.
Daye is also served by the China National Highway 106 (which coincides in this area with China National Highway 316).
History.
Daye County existed on and off for centuries; as recently as the WWII period, it included much of today's prefecture-level city of Huangshi. This means that pre-1949 references to a location in "Daye" or "Tayeh" may actually refer to anywhere within today's Huangshi.
Daye County was re-established on June 1, 1962, on a rather smaller scale, as part of Huangshi City. On February 18, 1994 Daye was converted into a county-level city, still within the prefecture-level city of Huangshi.
Dialect.
The speech of Daye and the adjacent counties farther south (toward the Jiangxi border) has been traditionally characterized as the Daye dialect, part of the Datong dialect group of Gan Chinese.

Military humor

Military humor is humor based on stereotypes of military life. Military humor portrays a wide range of characters and situations in the armed forces. It comes in a wide array of cultures and tastes, making use of burlesque, cartoons, comic strips, double entendre, exaggeration, jokes, parody, gallows humor, pranks, ridicule and sarcasm.
Military humor often comes in the form of military jokes or "barracks jokes". Military slang, in any language, is also full of humorous expressions; the term "fart sack" is military slang for a bed or sleeping bag. Barrack humor also often makes use of dysphemism, such as the widespread usage of "shit on a shingle" for chipped beef. Certain military expressions, like friendly fire, are a frequent source of satirical humor.
Notable cartoonists of military humor include Bill Mauldin, Dave Breger, George Baker, Shel Silverstein and Vernon Grant.
Comic strips.
The best-known comic strip about military life is Mort Walker's long-run "Beetle Bailey", set in a United States Army military post where a number of inept characters are stationed. Also notable are George Baker's "Sad Sack" and Dave Breger's "Private Breger". When Roy Crane created the "Buz Sawyer" Sunday strip, he put the emphasis not on Sawyer but on his comedic sidekick Sweeney. "Half Hitch", Hank Ketcham's strip of Navy humor, was distributed by King Features Syndicate from 1970 to 1975.
Military humor in comic books includes the "All Select Comics" comic book feature "Jeep Jones" by Chic Stone.
Films.
Among the oldest military comedies in film are the Flagg and Quirt films. Comedy films about World War II include "Buck Privates" (1941), "Stalag 17" (1953), "Mr. Roberts" (1955), "Kelly's Heroes" (1970) and "Catch-22" (1970). The film "Forrest Gump" (1994) offers a glimpse of military humor when portraying Gump as a soldier in training and later fighting in Vietnam.
Television.
Some comedies, like the "Don't Call Me Charlie" (1962-63) TV series (about a young veterinarian drafted into the Army and stationed in Paris), are totally devoted to the military theme. The fourth series of the British sitcom "Blackadder", known as "Blackadder Goes Forth", revolves around the life of Edmund Blackadder in the trenches of World War I.
Books.
Notable books include Shel Silverstein's "Grab Your Socks" (1956), Jaroslav Hašek's "The Good Soldier Švejk" (1923) and "Catch 22" by Joseph Heller. "Reader's Digest'"s "Humor in Uniform" (1963) is a collection of short true anecdotes depicting amusing experiences in the armed forces. In 1941, according to editor Harold Hersey, there were about 350 Army camp newspapers. Three years later, when they had expanded to "hundreds and hundreds", he compiled his collection of camp newspapers cartoons, "More G.I. Laughs" (1944).
In 2002, Hyperion published "Kilroy Was Here: The Best American Humor from World War II" by Charles Osgood. "Publishers Weekly" reviewed:
Magazines.
Widely circulated on military bases during the 1950s, "Charley Jones Laugh Book" was an outgrowth of earlier military humor publications. During World War II, Jones sold "Latrine Gazette" on Army bases, so successful that he recycled the material into another publication, "HEADliners", aimed at Navy men, and then launched "Charley Jones Laugh Book" as a nationally distributed magazine in 1943. "Captain Billy's Whiz Bang" began in a similar fashion after World War I.
Humour in the former South African Defence Force.
Military humour in the SADF was to be found less in jokes than in humorous expressions and comments. It is sometimes difficult to express their force, since most of it is in Afrikaans, and the play on words does not always translate into English without explanation. SADF humour can be very vulgar, but is never blasphemous. Much of it is to be found in the mouths of Instructor Corporals addressing trainees:
Plays on words were also popular, for example:
Like any other army, there were also standard slang terms for equipment and uniforms:
The various corps had humorously insulting names for each other. Amongst others:
There were also soft-covered cartoon books satirizing army life. An example is one based on the old SADF adage, “There are only two sizes in the SADF; too big and too small.” It shows a squad of new recruits, all wearing uniforms and boots far too big or small. In the middle is a soldier with perfectly fitting gear. The Corporal is shouting at him: “What’s the matter with you, soldier? How come everything fits so perfectly?”

I Am... Sasha Fierce

I Am... Sasha Fierce is the third studio album by American recording artist Beyoncé. It was released on November 14, 2008, by Music World Entertainment and Columbia Records. In its initial release, the album was formatted as a dual disc, intending to market Beyoncé's contrasting facets of artistry. The first disc, "I Am...", contains slow and midtempo pop and R&B ballads, while the second, "Sasha Fierce" (named after Beyoncé's on-stage alter ego), focuses on more uptempo beats that blend electropop and Europop genres. In composing the songs' lyrics, Beyoncé worked with many writers, with each session accompanied by live orchestration.
Beyoncé credited both her husband, rapper Jay-Z, and jazz singer Etta James for inspiring her to push the limits of her songwriting and artistry. Musically, "I Am..." drew inspiration from folk and alternative rock, while blending acoustic guitar elements into contemporary ballads. The tracks on the first disc were written and produced by Beyoncé, during collaborative efforts with Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds, Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, Terius "The-Dream" Nash and Ryan Tedder. "Sasha Fierce" boasted production from Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins and Sean "The Pen" Garrett. Critically, the album was met with generally lukewarm reviews from professionals. Many commented on the album's failure to properly differentiate the double-discs contrasts and goals.
"I Am... Sasha Fierce" debuted at number one on the "Billboard" 200 chart, with first-week sales of 482,000 units, earning Beyoncé her third consecutive US number-one solo album. The album earned at least seventeen platinum and one diamond certifications in separate worldwide markets. As of March 2011, "I Am... Sasha Fierce" had sold over seven million copies worldwide, with its digital tracks accounting for an additional 30 million units. The album garnered eight Grammy Award nominations at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, eventually collecting a record setting six wins—the most awards won in one night. The only other singer who was able to win six awards in one night was singer Adele in 2012. To promote the album, Beyoncé made several award show and televised appearances across Europe and America and embarking on the worldwide I Am... World Tour (2009–10).
The album spawned several singles; some served as international and stateside releases, while others were purely for promotional purposes. The two lead singles from "I Am... Sasha Fierce", "If I Were a Boy" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", both charted highly internationally. The former topped the charts in over eight countries and reached number three on the "Billboard" Hot 100, with the latter becoming her fifth number one single on the Hot 100 chart. "Diva" and "Ego" were released as US-only singles, while "Halo" and "Sweet Dreams" were promoted internationally as the third and fourth singles respectively. "Broken-Hearted Girl" was released internationally as the fifth single, while "Video Phone" was released in November 2009 and "Why Don't You Love Me" was released in July 2010.
Development.
In a letter addressed to her fans, Beyoncé revealed that she worked on "I Am... Sasha Fierce" for nearly one year, taking time to "create her sound ... Something that says who I am at this stage in my life. I have poured my heart and soul into it." It was project on which she spent the longest period of time since her first records at 14 years old as a member of Destiny's Child. She began working on "I Am... Sasha Fierce" in December 2007; Beyoncé felt that she had to show artistic growth on the record, "Even though I've been very successful and very fortunate, I want to still be challenged." Beyoncé was inspired by her husband Jay-Z and Etta James, whom she played in the 2008 musical biopic "Cadillac Records"; James' boldness inspired Beyoncé to express herself directly and honestly, and explore musical genres and styles that she had not experimented with previously. Beyoncé had already started producing material for "I Am... Sasha Fierce", but in the middle of recording signed on for "Cadillac Records". After studying of the life of James and her work on "Cadillac Record", the production of "I Am... Sasha Fierce" resulted in new dramatic range once Beyoncé had finished the film; the direction of the album was altered. Beyoncé was willing to take risks and redefine who she was. She hoped to reach out for a wider audience, including people who buy records by American singers John Mayer and Carrie Underwood. She explained in an interview:
The music I made before and after the movie were very different. I was a lot more bold and fearless after I played Etta James, because of course some of the character stays with you. Some of the music I would have been afraid to make, I wasn’t. I got more guts, more confidence as a human being. I think that’s why I love doing movies so much, because it’s not just an art form. It changes my life and my music and the way I look at things. When you’re a pop star, it’s a little conservative, you always have to stay in a box. You have fans that are 5 and fans that are 65, there are so many people that want so many things. But Etta James was the queen of rock ’n’ roll, soul, R&B, jazz — she did it all, and she always made it her own. After playing her and singing her songs, I thought, it’s time for me to challenge myself and do whatever I’m inspired to do. I know you have to make a transition into being legendary, and I knew that it was time.
Production and recording.
The recording of the album took place over an eight-month period, beginning in December 2007. Beyoncé recorded the album in sessions at Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta; Chung King Studios, Electric Lady Studios, Strawberrybee Productions in New York; GAD Studios in Ibiza, Spain; Mansfield Studios and The Campground in Los Angeles; South Beat Studios in Miami Beach; and The Boom Boom Room in Burbank, California. Beyoncé either co-wrote or co-produced all material on "I Am... Sasha Fierce". She collaborated with several record producers and songwriters, including Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds, Stargate (a production duo composed of Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen), Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, Terius "The-Dream" Nash, Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins, Sean Garrett, Solange, Jim Jonsin, Rico Love, Ryan Tedder, Shondrae "Bangladesh" Crawford, Ian Dench, Dave McCracken, Wayne Wilkins and Elvis Williams. Beyoncé also collaborated with some musicians she had never worked with in the past, including Toby Gad and BC Jean on "If I Were a Boy", and Amanda Ghost on "Disappear".
For the "I Am..." disc, Beyoncé was influenced by folk and alternative rock genres, while incorporating other instruments she had not normally used previously, such as the acoustic guitar. Tedder specifically assisted Beyoncé with crafting the album's balladry. The ballads were crafted in a way to combine "the best elements" of pop and soul music, while simultaneously "expanding the possibilities of both genres". Beyoncé attempted something different as people had strong expectations from her; she experimented with stronger lyrics. Beyoncé worked with Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's "Ave Maria" after having co-written "Disappear" in London. Ghost told "The Daily Telegraph" that they were both inspired by their then-recent marriages and had walked down the aisle to "Ave Maria".
During the eight-month period, Beyoncé recorded over 70 songs and decided during the editing process that she did not want to reconcile the two approaches into one disc. She explained, "There's my personal life, my sensitive side, and then me as a performer, sexy and energized and fun ... Artistically it was more fulfilling recording and writing the "I Am..." disc." If a song was meaningless to her, she cut them off during the process of elimination for the final track-listing.Beyoncé later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to make the final cut.-->In the months leading up to the release of the album, Beyoncé released a statement on her official website giving details about the nature of the album and what could be expected from it. She said: "I am in a different place right now and I want people to see the many sides of me. The music is upbeat for the dance, fun side and it is reflective, passionate and serious for the personal side. It's me and I am so excited to share it with the world on November 18." Making comparisons to a magazine, Beyoncé further elaborated that the record was a double album and that it had two covers. The black-and-white artworks for the standard, deluxe and platinum editions of "I Am... Sasha Fierce" were all shot by German photographer Peter Lindbergh.
Composition.
In an interview for "Billboard" magazine, Beyoncé described "I Am... Sasha Fierce" as a double album. She said, "One side has songs that are more mainstream and another has my more traditional R&B songs for my fans who've been there the whole time. Some of it sounds like Barbra Streisand, Karen Carpenter and The Beatles around the 1970s." In another interview with MTV News, Beyoncé said: "Half the record, I Am..., is about who I am underneath all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama. And Sasha Fierce is the fun, more sensual, more aggressive, more outspoken side and more glamorous side that comes out when I'm working and when I'm onstage. The double album allows me to take more risks and really step out of myself, or shall I say, step more into myself, and reveal a side of me that only people who know me see." Music writer Andy Kellman of Allmusic viewed its first disc as, "essentially a small set of adult contemporary ballads. Acoustic guitars, pianos, strings, contemplative soul searching, and grand sweeping gestures fill it out, with more roots in '70s soft rock than soul."
The second disc, "Sasha Fierce", contains consistent electro influences, which are displayed in songs like "Radio" and "Sweet Dreams". Kellman said in his review that "Diva" resembles "B'Day'"s "Freakum Dress" or "Ring the Alarm" in terms of audacity. Despite being on the "Sasha Fierce" disc, "Ego", "Why Don't You Love Me" and "Scared of Lonely" were noted to be a meeting ground between the album's halves. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, they resemble "Sasha Fierce" musically, but thematically and lyrically, they are vulnerable like Beyoncé on the "I Am..." disc. The album formally introduces Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce. She revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her 2003 hit single "Crazy in Love". In an interview with Emmet Sullivan of "People" magazine, Beyoncé affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage, with the editor describing Sasha Fierce as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego.
Music and lyrical content.
"If I Were a Boy", the first single of "I Am...", stands as the only song on either disc that Beyoncé did not co-write. BC Jean, who wrote most of the song's lyrics, took inspiration from the product of a poor relationship. Beyoncé explained in "Essence Magazine" that "If I Were a Boy" is different from her previous songs in the sense that it is not a traditional R&B song. Music critics remarked that the song seemed to be a mixture of Beyoncé's 2006 hit "Irreplaceable", Fergie's 2007 single "Big Girls Don't Cry", and Ciara's 2007 single "Like a Boy". Ann Powers of the "Los Angeles Times" saw the song's theme of female empowerment as an expansion on that of "Irreplaceable". Musically, "Single Ladies" is an upbeat-dance-pop and R&B song, and features dancehall and bounce influences. According to Jonah Weiner of "Blender", the song makes a clear reference to marriage while Greg Kot of the "Chicago Tribune" felt that the lyrics had a connection with "post-breakup". "Halo", composed by Ryan Tedder and Evan Bogart, was initially intended for Beyoncé but was almost recorded by Leona Lewis due to Beyoncé's schedule. According to Christian Williams of "Billboard", "Halo" has a mainstream pop sound, with subtle R&B undertones. Critics noted "Diva" as a variation on Lil Wayne's "A Milli" and coined it as its female counterpart. "Diva" carries a stuttering beat, accompanied by a slow-rolling, bass-pumping groove. In the song, the female protagonist speaks and sings about the positive definition of a diva, explaining "diva is a female version of a hustler", and makes frequent references to her millions of dollars, even fanning herself with dollar bills.
"Sweet Dreams" was critically acclaimed for its use of electronic bassline, which was compared to Michael Jackson's "Beat It", and for its electropop sound. "Sweet Dreams" is derived from contemporary R&B and incorporates influences from the classic 1980s funk. "Broken-Hearted Girl" is a midtempo piano ballad. Its production and melody is backed by strings and a drum machine beat. According to Spence D. of IGN Music, "Hello" comes off like another ballad that "populatethe first part of the album." It contains the "Jerry Maguire" line – "You had me at hello" – as part of its chorus. It essentially consists of "sweet guitar-picking and delicate harmonies." According to critics, "Video Phone" contains lyrics that are in reference to "a celebration of Skype sex and putting on a solo show, on camera, for a guy you just met at the club". The remixed version featured both Beyoncé and Lady Gaga trading verses with one another. Musically the song consists of simple lyrics, with hidden innuendos, and is backed by thin-spread beats; Beyoncé and Gaga uttering gasps and groans while singing the song. The album also contains several reworked songs including "Smash into You", which was previously recorded by Jon McLaughlin as "Smack into You". The song was re-worked and re-recorded by Beyoncé, earning her minimal song writing credits for changing "Smack" into "Smash". It was subsequently used for the soundtrack of "Obsessed", a 2009 film in which the Beyoncé had a lead role. "Disappear" consists of "sweet guitar-picking and delicate harmonies". "That's Why You're Beautiful" is a slow-tempo soft rock and rock power ballad, which consists of a "grungy" guitar riff and stuterring drums. Critics compared the song with the materials by Alice in Chains and Jill Scott. The platinum edition of the album also included a cover version by Beyoncé of the 1979 Billy Joel song "Honesty".
Release.
The deluxe edition of the album was released simultaneously with the standard edition. Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé's father and then manager, held a listening party for the album in New York on October 22, 2008. On June 16, 2009, "Above and Beyoncé: Video Collection & Dance Mixes" was released as a combined CD and DVD. The release included a CD of dance remixes to the singles of the album (including the "Ego" remix with rapper Kanye West) and the DVD features videos previously released for these singles.

The deluxe edition of the album was re-issued in the United States on November 23, 2009, including all of the previously released songs in addition to the new songs "Poison", "Why Don't You Love Me", and the remix of "Video Phone" with Lady Gaga.
An EP titled "I Am...Sasha Fierce – The Bonus Tracks" was released on November 23, 2009, in several countries featuring these new tracks. Following the album's digital release, "Ave Maria" debuted at number 150 on November 29, 2008 on the UK Singles Chart. Beyoncé also covered a version of the song "Honesty" (a 1979 song by Billy Joel) and included it as a bonus track for the platinum edition of the album. It gained some attention in Japan where it charted at number 79 in 2009. After the release of "I Am... Sasha Fierce – The Bonus Tracks" a new song "Poison", which featured on the EP, became very popular in Korea and reached the top position of the Korean Singles Chart during the week ending February 7, 2010. In February 2010 a bonus track from the album's multiple re-releases "Why Don't You Love Me", which served as a promotional single, climbed up the US Hot Dance Club Songs, eventually taking the top spot and becoming Beyoncé's thirteenth number-one dance hit. On May 4, 2010, a full-length music video appeared online. After its release as a promotional single, "Why Don't You Love Me" peaked at number fifty-one on the UK Singles chart and at number fourteen on its R&B chart.

Critical reception.
"I Am... Sasha Fierce" received generally lukewarm reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 24 reviews. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote that the album's "strength" is "its individual songs ... a testament to Beyoncé as one of today's most reliable singles artists", but felt that "the real disparity is her inability to reconcile the adult-contemporary schmaltz of "I Am" with the more modern, edgy sounds of "Sasha Fierce"." Adam Mattera of "The Observer" felt that both discs lack depth, observing that the first is "too busy chasing radio formats to expose any genuine soul", and criticizing the second disc's "succession of independent woman anthems such as 'Single Ladies' and 'Diva', which will no doubt inspire drag queens the world over but leave most others bemused." Pitchfork Medias Ryan Dombal viewed it as a regression from "B'Day" and stated, "Nobody wins the Beyoncé vs. Sasha battle— often, the listener loses." Allmusic's Andy Kellman called its double-disc "gimmick" "flimsy" and favored its second disc's "decent, if easily forgettable, upbeat pop." He expressed that on the "I Am..." disc, "Beyoncé "feels" each line to the fullest extent, which almost rescues the set's staidness." MSN Music's Robert Christgau named it the "dud of the month" with a "B" grade, indicating "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought". He found its "split-personality bit" to be "deeply vapid", only observing "three good songs on this 11-track artifact".
Jonah Weiner of "Blender" commented that "Beyoncé is still a beauty-shop feminist, quick with the smack-downs, and she still describes the rattling rush of love with preternatural poise". Matos Michaelangelo of "The A.V. Club" found both discs "pretty uneven." Stacey Anderson of "Spin" commented that its first disc "meanders over [...] down-tempo cuts" and called "... Sasha" "an intriguing but diluted direction". "The Village Voice"s Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond felt that the "I Am..." disc lacks cohesion, but complimented ""Sasha Fierce" as "brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty," and stated, "each incendiary track challenges you to leave your inhibitions at coat-check." Christian Hoard of "Rolling Stone" noted that its slow songs are "full of bland self-affirmation and saggy lines", but wrote that "the "Sasha" disc boasts Beyoncé's most adventurous music yet". Colin McGuire of PopMatters called the album "a little rough around the edges at times" and viewed its "Sasha Fierce" disc as "a far more compelling trip down dance-lane". Leah Greenblatt of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that the album offers "two compelling sides" of Beyoncé and stated: "The collection might have been better served had she edited it down to one disc, rather than belabor what ultimately seems like a marketing gimmick. And while fans will surely speculate, there's little in the lyrics that feels more revealing than previous emotional fire-starters." Sasha Frere-Jones of "The New Yorker" found the album to be "something of a mess", mostly because the alter ego "trips on th idea of redefinition".
Accolades.
Leah Greenblatt of "Entertainment Weekly" ranked "I Am… Sasha Fierce" at number two on his list of the 10 Best Albums of 2008, stating that "'If I Were a Boy' and 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)' are undoubtedly album highlights; still, the surprise here is how consistently satisfying the rest of it is – even the less showy tracks blossom on repeated listening." Mark Edward Nero of About.com ranked it at the ninth place on his list of the Best R&B Albums of 2008. Christian Gerard of NBC Washington placed "I Am... Sasha Fierce" on his list of "Honorable Mentions" while writing the list for the Best Albums of 2008. Agence France-Presse, as reported by ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs, recognized the album as the twelfth best selling one of 2008. On the second anniversary of the debut of the album on the US "Billboard" 200 albums chart, Kyle Anderson of MTV News wrote an article on December 6, 2010, about Beyoncé's alter ego, titled "Beyoncé's Alter-Ego Tops The Charts: Wake-Up Video" in which the production and composition of "I Am... Sasha Fierce" were praised and said to be Beyoncé's "best and boldest" work yet. On "The Village Voice" Pazz & Jop year-end lists, "I Am... Sasha Fierce" was ranked at numbers 333 and 580 in 2008 and 2009 respectively. The album was ranked number twelve on the list of Best Albums of the Decade in "Rolling Stone"s Reader's Poll.

Eleanor Power

Eleanor Power (died 11 October 1754) was the first English woman to be executed in what is today Canada. Power was hanged for the murder of William Keen, a justice of the peace in St. John's, Newfoundland.
The crime.
Power, her husband Robert Power, and seven other men were convicted of murdering Keen in a burglary attempt of Keen's summer home on 9 September 1754. There had been ten accomplices who initially broke into Keen's house and stole a chest and some silver spoons. When the chest was found to contain only alcohol, Eleanor Power and one of the male accomplices left the scene. The eight who remained behind decided to make another burglary attempt. When Keen awoke in his bed during the second attempt, he was beaten by two of the accomplices with a scythe and the butt of a musket. Keen died of his injuries on 29 September 1754.
Trial and execution.
On 8 October 1754, nine of the accomplices, including Eleanor Power, were brought to trial for murder before the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Newfoundland. The tenth accomplice, Nicholas Tobin, was the only Crown witness against the nine defendants. Undefended by lawyers, the nine defendants were convicted of murder by a jury after 30 minutes of deliberation and sentenced to death by hanging. Two of the male accomplices were executed on 10 October 1754; the following day, Eleanor and Robert Power followed and became the first married couple to hang together in present-day Canada. Eleanor Power was also the first non-Native American woman to be executed by British authorities in present-day Canada.
After years of imprisonment in St. John's, the five remaining defendants were eventually pardoned on condition that they leave Newfoundland and never return.
Modern analysis.
Modern commentators have suggested that Eleanor Power might have escaped execution had she been represented by a qualified lawyer at her trial. This is because while Power could have legitimately been convicted of burglary, she was likely not guilty of murder since she had abandoned the conspirators after the first break-in and played no role in Keen's death. The same commentators have also suggested that the court that convicted the nine defendants was illegally constituted because the English law that governed the Colony of Newfoundland mandated that capital trials for offences committed in Newfoundland had to be tried by courts in England.

Brock Gap

Brock Gap (variant Brock’s Gap) is a natural pass across Shades Mountain in Hoover, Alabama, most notable as being the location used by the South & North Railroad (S&N) to reach the Birmingham area in the late 19th century from the mineral deposits to the south, spurring economic development in the area.
Geographic description.
Brock Gap is located at an elevation of 518 feet (158 meters) above mean sea level, the surrounding Shades Mountain is over 700 feet in elevation.
Historical rail use.
John Milner was tasked by the State of Alabama in 1858 to survey a route across Shades Mountain for the S&N Railroad. The S&N was intended to connect the mineral resources south of Shades Mountain, coal, limestone, and iron ore, with the developing industries in the area of Jones Valley that would become Birmingham around the junction of the S&N Railroad and the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad. Brock Gap was selected and the rail line north was constructed between 1858 and 1871, interrupted by the Civil War. At Brock Gap, workers used nitroglycerin to blast a cut 75 feet deep through limestone bedrock.
Current rail use.
Today, the 19th century cut is actively used by the CSX Lineville Subdivision, made up of part of the former Atlanta, Birmingham and Atlantic Railway, in its route from Birmingham to Atlanta, Georgia and Florida via Manchester, Georgia. The direct successor of the S&N Railroad, the CSX S&NA South Subdivision, is carried through a more recently constructed tunnel slightly east of the 19th century cut.

SS Orcades (1937)

RMS "Orcades" was a British passenger ship that Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd of Barrow-in-Furness built as an ocean liner in 1937. Her owner was Orient Line, which operated her between Britain and Australia 1937–39, and also as a cruise ship. The Admiralty then requisitioned her and had her converted into a troopship.
In 1942 the attacked her off South Africa. "Orcades" crew and gunners fought to fend off the submarine and save their ship, and it took "U-172" two and a half hours and seven torpedoes to sink her. "Orcades" Master, Charles Fox, was decorated by the Crown and Lloyd's of London for his bravery and leadership.
Civilian service.
"Orcades" is the Latin name for the Orkney Islands. She was the second of two sister ships; having been completed in July 1935. At each, "Orion" and "Orcades" were the two largest liners in Orient Line's fleet. Each had a speed of . The New Zealand-born modernist architect Brian OʼRorke designed the interiors of both ships.
"Orion" and "Orcades" were registered in London and their homeport was Tilbury. Their route took them "via" Gibraltar, Palma, Toulon, Naples, Port Said, Suez, Aden, Colombo, Fremantle, Adelaide and Sydney to Brisbane. When not operating their liner route, "Orion" and "Orcades" provided cruises to Scandinavia, the Baltic Sea, Mediterranean, Adriatic Sea and Atlantic islands.
Loss.
On 9 October 1942 "Orcades" left Cape Town for Liverpool carrying 741 passengers, 3,000 tons of general cargo and 2,000 bags of mail. She was making about , and zigzagging to make her harder attack. On 10 October at 10:28 hrs she was about south-west of the Cape Town when , commanded by Kapitänleutnant Carl Emmermann, hit her port side with two torpedoes: one forward in her no. 1 and 2 holds and the other aft in her no. 6 hold. Her steering gear and port engine were disabled but she remained afloat, so most of her crew and passengers were able to prepare to abandon ship.
At 10:45 hrs "U-172" hit her amidships with a third torpedo and she began to settle in the water, on an even keel but slightly down by the bow. She continued to make way with her starboard engine, and despite a heavy sea launched 20 lifeboats. One capsized but its occupants were rescued. Another became swamped; drifted away and its occupants were not seen again. A skeleton crew of 56 men remained aboard to try to save the ship, although she was making only and running in circles. At 10:54 hrs "U-172" fired a fourth torpedo but it missed. "Orcades" engineers restarted her port engine, her speed increased to and by steering with her screws she started to make for the coast.
"U-172" surfaced in order to increase speed and overtake her, but "Orcades" gunners opened fire and the submarine had to dive again. At 12:49, 12:50 and 12:54 hrs "U-172" hit the ship with three more torpedoes on her starboard side, breaking her back. She listed heavily to starboard and sank at about 13:00 hrs. 55 of her skeleton crew abandoned ship by launching her last four lifeboats and her liferafts, but her Chief Engineer, William Johnston, went down with the ship. A total of 45 people were lost. "U-172" remained at periscope depth but shortly afterwards an Allied aircraft attacked her and drove her away, which prevented her from questioning survivors.
"Orcades" had transmitted distress signals, and the destroyers and were sent in response. "En route" the destroyers encountered and engaged another submarine, , but after she crash-dived they broke off the engagement to continue to "Orcades". A few hours after the liner's sinking a Polish merchant ship, Gdynia America Line's , reached "Orcades" boats. Despite the risk of further submarine attack, "Narwik" spent several hours rescuing 1,022 survivors and searching for three missing lifeboats until 03:30 hrs on 11 October. She then made for the South African coast, and after 10 hours "Nizam" and "Foxhound" joined her and escorted her into port.
"Orcades" Master, Captain Charles Fox, was made a CBE and awarded Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea.

Moogy Klingman

Mark "Moogy" Klingman (September 7, 1950 – November 15, 2011) was an American musician and songwriter. He was a founding member of Todd Rundgren's band Utopia, and later became a solo recording artist, bandleader and songwriter. He released two solo recordings, and his songs have been covered by artists as wide ranging as Johnny Winter, Carly Simon, James Cotton, Thelma Houston, Eric Clapton, Barry Manilow and Guns N' Roses. He played on stage with Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, Luther Vandross, Lou Reed, Jeff Beck and Allan Woody & Warren Haynes of the Allman Brothers and Gov't Mule. Other than Rundgren, his longest musical association may have been with Bette Midler, whom he served as band leader and who adopted for her signature song "(You Gotta Have) Friends", composed by Klingman and William "Buzzy" Linhart. 
Life and career.
"Moogy" Klingman's nickname was not from the musical instrument, but from his baby sister's pronunciation of "Marky" as "Moo-Gee." He did later play Moog synthesizers, but his nickname was already well established..
Klingman grew up in the Long Island suburb of Great Neck, New York. By age 10 he was collecting comic books and gramophone records, playing DJ in his basement. Through his older sister, he got an access pass to attend the 1965 Newport Folk Festival performance where Bob Dylan "went electric," meeting Dylan before and after the concert. Back home, his band The Living Few was signed to a demo deal by producer Dick Glass and recorded a demo of Dylan songs and original tunes.
At 16, he joined Jimmy James and the Blue Flames with Jimi Hendrix and Randy California. His jug band performance with schoolmate Andy Kaufman in a controversial civil rights concert resulted in his expulsion from high school in 1966, after which he went to Quintano's School for Young Professionals in New York City. By then, his band Glitterhouse had made records with the star producer Bob Crewe, as well as Crewe's soundtrack to the 1968 Roger Vadim film "Barbarella" with Jane Fonda.
Klingman's association with Todd Rundgren commenced in 1968 when they met outside the Cafe Au Go Go in Greenwich Village. In Klingman's Manhattan loft, he and Rundgren constructed the Secret Sound recording studio where Rundgren produced his "A Wizard, A True Star", "Todd", and other albums. Moogy was the original keyboardist for Todd Rundgren's Utopia, and Klingman's band Moogy & the Rhythm Kings (John "Willie" Wilcox, Ralph Schuckett, John Seigler) formed the core of the original Utopia. He played on ten Todd Rundgren solo albums, as well as several Utopia albums.
When Lou Reed found himself in 1972 with an acclaimed album, "Transformer", but no backing musicians to support it on tour, he tried hiring an inexperienced bar band called The Tots, but ultimately fired them mid-tour. With barely a week's notice, Klingman came up with a new five-member backing band, and completed the tour.
Klingman played keyboards and produced Bette Midler's duet with Bob Dylan "Buckets of Rain" - which appeared on Midler's 1976 album, "Songs for the New Depression". He became her musical director, taking over from Barry Manilow. Klingman collaborated with William "Buzzy" Linhart in co-writing "(You Gotta Have) Friends", which became Bette Midler's de facto theme song.
Klingman had solo albums out on Capitol and EMI records, as well as on his own label. Songs from his solo albums were covered by Johnny Winter, Eric Clapton, Barry Manilow, Bette Midler, Todd Rundgren and others. His song "Dust in the Wind" (not to be confused with the hit song of the same name by Kansas) was covered by Todd Rundgren on his album "Something/Anything?" and has been performed live in concert by Guns N' Roses.
Klingman became the executive producer and musical director of the "Music From Free Creek" "supersession" project when Rundgren's agent Albert Grossman wanted too much money on his behalf, and Rundgren passed the job on to his friend. The sessions featured the participation of Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Keith Emerson, Mitch Mitchell, Harvey Mandel and Linda Ronstadt.
Klingman also performed live at many venues with various groups, playing for Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, Buzzy Linhart and then in the 1990s, with members of the Allman Brothers/Gov't Mule, and a summer tour with Bo Diddley. He was the co-founder of the band The Peaceniks, along with Barry Gruber. Klingman also played in the Moogy/Woody Band with Allman Brothers alumni Allan Woody, and Warren Haynes. In 1979 he had a show on Manhattan Cable Channel J called "Manhattan Alley".
A benefit concert was held in January 2011, to help pay Klingman's medical expenses, and saw the original Todd Rundgren's Utopia, featuring Ralph Schuckett, Kevin Ellman, John Siegler and Klingman, reunite on stage for the first time in over thirty years.
Klingman died of bladder cancer in New York on November 15, 2011, at the age of 61.

<doc id="19707357" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19707357" title="Prevalence of rabies">
Prevalence of rabies

Almost all human deaths caused by rabies occur in Asia and Africa. There are an estimated 55,000 human deaths annually from rabies worldwide.
Dog licensing, killing of stray dogs, muzzling, and other measures contributed to the elimination of rabies from the United Kingdom in the early 20th century. More recently, large-scale vaccination of cats, dogs and ferrets has been successful in combating rabies in many developed countries.
Rabies is a zoonotic disease, caused by the rabies virus. The rabies virus, a member of the Lyssavirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae family, survives in a diverse variety of animal reservoirs, including bats, monkeys, raccoons, foxes, skunks, wolves, coyotes, dogs, mongoose, weasels, cats, cattle and other domestic farm animals, groundhogs, bears and other wild carnivores. However, in Asia, parts of America and large parts of Africa, dogs remain the principal host. Mandatory vaccination of animals is less effective in rural areas. Especially in developing countries, pets may not be privately kept and their destruction may be unacceptable. Oral vaccines can be safely distributed in baits, and this has successfully reduced rabies in rural areas of Canada, France and the United States and elsewhere, like in Montreal where baits are successfully used among raccoons in the Mount Royal park area.
Asia.
An estimated 31,000 human deaths occur annually from rabies in Asia, including about 20,000 in India, which has the highest rate of human rabies in the world primarily due to stray dogs. Because of a decline number of vultures due to acute poisoning primarily due to the anti-inflammatory diclofenac, animal carcasses are no longer being sufficiently cleared—as the vultures were in competition with feral dogs for these carcasses as food-source, the dogs breed unfettered and produce a larger pool of carriers for the rabies virus. Another reason for the great increase in the number of stray dogs is the 2001 law that forbade the killing of dogs.
, Vietnam had the second-highest rate, followed by Thailand; in these countries, the virus is primarily transmitted through canines (feral dogs and other wild canine species). Another source of rabies in Asia is the pet boom. In 2006 China introduced the "one-dog policy" in Beijing to control the problem.
The island of Bali in Indonesia has been undergoing a severe outbreak of canine rabies since 2008, that has also killed about 78 humans as of late September 2010. Unlike predominantly Muslim parts of Indonesia, in Bali many dogs are kept as pets and strays are tolerated in residential areas. Efforts are under way to vaccinate pets and strays, as well as selective culling of some strays, to control the outbreak. As Bali is a popular tourist destination, visitors are advised to consider rabies vaccinations before going there, if they will be touching animals.
Africa.
Approximately 24 000 people die annually in Africa a rate of approximately 23 per million population.
South Africa.
In South Africa between 10 to 30 cases of human rabies are confirmed every year and it is particularly widespread in the north-eastern regions of the Eastern Cape, the eastern and south-eastern areas of Mpumalanga, northern Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal. Dogs are the main vector (especially in the east of the country)for the disease but also wildlife including the bat-eared fox, yellow mongoose and black-backed jackal. The death rate of 13 per annum over the decade 2001-2010 is a rate of approximately 0.26 per million population. This is approximately 30 times the rate in the United States but 1/90th of the African average. The number of cases per province over the last decade are as follows:
United States.
Southern United States.
Rabies was once rare in the United States outside the Southern states, but raccoons in the mid-Atlantic and northeast United States have been suffering from a rabies epidemic since the 1970s, that is now moving westwards into Ohio.
Midwestern United States.
In the midwestern United States, skunks are the primary carriers of rabies, composing 134 of the 237 documented non-human cases in 1996. The most widely distributed reservoir of rabies in the United States, however, and the source of most human cases in the U.S., are bats. Nineteen of the twenty-two human rabies cases documented in the United States between 1980 and 1997 have been identified genetically as bat rabies. In many cases, victims are not even aware of having been bitten by a bat, assuming that a small puncture wound found after the fact was the bite of an insect or spider; in some cases, no wound at all can be found, leading to the hypothesis that in some cases the virus can be contracted via inhaling airborne aerosols from the vicinity of bats. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned on May 9, 1997, that a woman who died in October, 1996 in Cumberland County, Kentucky and a man who died in December, 1996 in Missoula County, Montana were both infected with a rabies strain found in silver-haired bats; although bats were found living in the chimney of the woman's home and near the man's workplace, neither victim could remember having had any contact with them. Similar reports among spelunkers led to experimental demonstration in animals. This inability to recognize a potential infection, in contrast to a bite from a dog or raccoon, leads to a lack of proper prophylactic treatment, and is the cause of the high mortality rate for bat bites.
On September 7, 2007, rabies expert Dr. Charles Rupprecht of Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that canine rabies had disappeared from the United States. Rupprecht emphasized that the disappearance of the canine-specific strain of rabies virus in the US does not eliminate the need for dog rabies vaccination as dogs can still become infected from exposure to wildlife.
Europe.
Several countries in Europe have been designated rabies-free jurisdictions: Austria, United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Greece, Malta, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Czech Republic, and Iceland.
Spain.
The first case of rabies since 1978 was confirmed in the city of Toledo, Central Spain, on 5th June 2013. The dog had been imported from Morocco. No human fatalities have been reported, although adults and children were reported to have been bitten by the animal.
Germany.
Nine deaths from rabies were reported in Germany between 1981 and 2005. Two were caused by animal bites within Germany (one fox, one dog), and four were acquired abroad. In the remaining three cases, the source was a transplant from a donor who had died of rabies. On 28 September 2008, the World Organisation for Animal Health declared Germany as free of rabies.
Ireland.
In 1897 the Disease of Animals Act included provisions to prevent the spread of rabies throughout Ireland. There have been no indigenous cases reported since 1903. In 2009, four people in Dublin received rabies vaccination therapy after being bitten by an imported kitten, although subsequent examination of the kitten yielded a negative result for rabies.
United Kingdom.
The UK was declared rabies free in 1902 but there were further outbreaks after 1918 when servicemen returning from war smuggled rabid dogs back to Britain. The disease was subsequently eradicated and Britain was declared rabies-free in 1922 after the introduction of compulsory quarantine for dogs.
Since 1902, there have been 26 deaths in the UK from rabies (excluding the European bat lyssavirus 2 case discussed below). A case in 1902 occurred shortly before the eradication of rabies from the UK, and no details were recorded for a case in 1919. All other cases of rabies caused by rabies virus acquired the infection while abroad. Sixteen cases (62%) involved infections acquired in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh.
Since 2000, four deaths from rabies have occurred; none of these cases had received any post-exposure prophylactic treatment. In 2001, there were two deaths from infections acquired in Nigeria and the Philippines. One death occurred in 2005 from an infection acquired by a dog bite in Goa (western India). A woman died on 6 January 2009 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. She is believed to have been infected in South Africa, probably from being scratched by a dog. Prior to this, the last reported human case of the disease in Northern Ireland was in 1938. The most recent case was a woman who died on 28 May 2012 in London after being bitten by a dog in South Asia.
A rabies-like lyssavirus, called European bat lyssavirus 2, was identified in bats in 2003. There has been one case of a bite from an infected bat, but the victim showed no symptoms of the virus and was vaccinated quickly as a precaution. In 2002, there was a fatal case in a bat handler involving infection with European bat lyssavirus 2; infection was probably acquired from a bite from a bat in Scotland.
Benelux.
The Netherlands has been designated rabies-free since 1923, Belgium since 2008. Isolated cases of rabies involving illegally smuggled pets from Africa, as well as infected animals crossing the German and French borders do occur.
[[File:Rabies Free Countries.svg|thumb|right|300px|Rabies-free jurisdictions, as of January 2006:
Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Fiji, Guam, Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Japan, and Taiwan/ROC.]]
Middle East.
Israel.
Since 1948, 29 people have been reported dead from rabies in Israel. The last death was in 2003, when a 58-year-old Bedouin woman was bitten by a cat and became infected. She was not inoculated and later died.
Rabies-free jurisdictions.
Many countries and territories have been declared to be free of rabies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the following list based on countries and political units that reported no indigenous cases of rabies (excluding bat rabies) during 2009.
New Zealand and Australia have never had rabies. However, in Australia, the Australian bat lyssavirus occurs normally in both insectivorous and fruit-eating bats (flying foxes) from most mainland states. Scientists believe it is present in bat populations throughout the range of flying foxes in Australia. Rabies has also never been reported in Cook Islands, Jersey in the Channel Islands, mainland Norway, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Vanuatu.

Rabies in animals

Rabies is a viral zoonotic neuroinvasive disease which causes inflammation in the brain and is usually fatal. Rabies primarily infects mammals and is caused by the rabies virus. Animals with rabies suffer deterioration of the brain and tend to behave bizarrely and often aggressively, increasing the chances that they will bite another animal or a person and transmit the disease.
Stages of disease.
Three stages of rabies are recognized in dogs and other animals. 
Mammals.
Bats.
The problem of bat-transmitted rabies is found over most of North and South America but it was first closely studied in Trinidad in the West Indies. This island had a known reputation for bat rabies, which took a significant toll of livestock and humans alike. In the 10 years from 1925 and 1935, 89 people and thousands of livestock had died from it—“the highest human mortality from rabies-infected bats thus far recorded anywhere.” 
In early 1931, Dr. H. Metivier, a Veterinary surgeon, established the connection between the bites of bats and paralytic rabies. In September 1931, Dr. Joseph Lennox Pawan of Trinidad in the West Indies, a Government Bacteriologist, found Negri bodies in the brain of a bat with unusual habits. In 1932, Dr. Pawan first discovered that infected vampire bats could transmit rabies to humans and other animals. In 1934 the Trinidad and Tobago Government began a program of vampire bat control, shooting, netting, trapping, dynamiting nesting colonies and poisoning, while encouraging the screening off of livestock buildings and free vaccination programs for exposed livestock.
After the opening of the Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory in 1953, basic research on bats and rabies progressed rapidly under the able direction of Arthur Greenhall, who demonstrated that at least 8 species of bats in Trinidad had been infected with rabies - particularly the Common Vampire Bat, "Desmodus rotundus" (which “will attack any warm blooded creature”), the rare White-winged Vampire Bat, "Diaemus youngi", (which “appears to have a special preference for birds and goats”), as well as two abundant species of Fruit Bats: the Seba's Short-tailed Bat or Short-tailed Fruit Bat, "Carollia perspicillata", which commonly roosts with Vampires, and the Jamaican Fruit Bat, "Artibeus jamaicensis".
Non-bite transmission of rabies in people has been reported by the CDC, and experimentally demonstrated with a high efficiency in susceptible animals placed in bat-proof and insect-proof cages in a cave with bat colonies by Constantine in Frio Cave, Texas, as early as 1960. In 1967, rabies virus was isolated from the air in the same cave, presumably passed by the bats urinating, potentially forming a source for infection of other susceptible animals, and presenting a hazard to researchers and spelunkers. While the risks may be low, they are deserving of further study and monitoring.
The United Kingdom, which has stringent regulations on the importation of animals, had also been believed to be entirely free from rabies until 1996 when a single Daubenton's bat was found to be infected with a rabies-like virus usually found only in bats: European Bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBL2). There were no more known cases until September 2002 when another Daubenton's bat tested positive for EBL2 in Lancashire. A bat conservationist who was bitten by the infected bat received post-exposure treatment and did not develop rabies.
Then in November 2002 David McRae (1947–2002), a Scottish bat conservationist from Guthrie, Angus was bitten on the ring finger of his left hand by a bat, thereby becoming the first human to contract rabies in the United Kingdom since 1902. He subsequently died in hospital from EBL2 rabies on November 24, 2002.
In November 2004, Jeanna Giese, a fifteen-year old girl from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, became one of only six humans known to have survived rabies after the onset of symptoms, and the first known instance of a human surviving rabies without vaccine treatment. Giese's disease was already too far progressed for the vaccine to help, and she was considered too weak to tolerate it. Doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Wauwatosa, a suburb of Milwaukee, achieved her survival with an experimental treatment that involved putting the girl into a drug-induced coma, and administering a cocktail of antiviral drugs. Giese had symptoms of full-blown rabies when she sought medical help, thirty-seven days after being bitten by a bat. Her family did not seek treatment at the time because the bat seemed healthy. Jeanna regained her weight, strength, and coordination while in the hospital. She was released from the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin on January 1, 2005.
On May 12, 2006, Harris County, Texas Health Department officials reported that a teenage boy, Zachary Jones of Humble, Texas, had died of rabies at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, Texas. Zachary had contracted the disease after a bat flew in his bedroom and bit him in his sleep. He was unaware he had been bitten and was not hospitalized until he developed symptoms several weeks later. He died at Texas Children's Hospital after an attempt to cure the disease through a drug-induced coma, similar to that of Jeanna Giese.
On November 2, 2006 a 10-year-old girl in Bourbon, Indiana, America died of rabies. The "Indianapolis Star" reports that she was bitten by a bat in June 2006.
In August 2006, a 73 year old rural resident located east of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada was bitten by a bat while he slept. He ignored the bite and became symptomatic in January 2007. Diagnosed with rabies in March 2007, he was treated with the Milwaukee protocol, but died April 26, 2007.
On August 6, 2006, 950 Girl Scouts were urged to receive rabies shots by the Girl Scouts of the USA. The nine hundred and fifty girls had attended a camp in Virginia, U.S.A. in July, and had reported seeing bats in their cabins. Even though infections were relatively unlikely, the GSA offered to pay for the shots, at a cost of nearly two million dollars. The Centers for Disease Control reports 27 cases of human rabies caused by the bat variant rabies virus in the United States from 1990 to 2002.
On December 8, 2007, a 34-year-old Dutch medical doctor died from rabies. According to Dutch media, the woman, who worked at the Amsterdam Academic Medical Center (AMC), had been attacked by a small bat while on holiday in Kenya the previous October. The attack, which occurred at a camping site somewhere between Nairobi and Mombasa, resulted in some bleeding scratches on her nose. She was infected with Duvenhage virus and succumbed to severe brain infection.
On August 8, 2008, it was reported that over the course of a year, 38 villagers of Delta Amacuro, Venezuela had died during a suspected outbreak of rabies spread by vampire bats.
In August 2010, a migrant worker died in a Louisiana hospital from a rabid vampire bat bite that occurred while the man was in Mexico.
Dogs.
Rabies has a long history of association with dogs. The first written record of rabies is in the Codex of Eshnunna (ca. 1930 BC), which dictates that the owner of a dog showing symptoms of rabies should take preventive measure against bites. If a person was bitten by a rabid dog and later died, the owner was fined heavily.
Three stages of rabies are recognized in dogs. The first stage is a one- to three-day period characterized by behavioral changes and is known as the prodromal stage. The second stage is the excitative stage, which lasts three to four days. It is this stage that is often known as "furious rabies" due to the tendency of the affected dog to be hyperreactive to external stimuli and bite at anything near. The third stage is the paralytic stage and is caused by damage to motor neurons. Incoordination is seen due to rear limb paralysis and drooling and difficulty swallowing is caused by paralysis of facial and throat muscles. Death is usually caused by respiratory arrest.
Opossums.
Experimental studies of rabies infection in the Virginia opossum have shown the importance of the mode of transmission. Opossums became infected when exposed to air-borne virus but were found to be fairly resistant to intramuscular inoculations. The aerosol transmission of rabies in opossum was investigated following the death from rabies of two men who had visited the Frio Caves, Texas, and did not remember any direct contact with bats.
Rabies cases in the Virginia opossum are spillover cases from other wildlife species such as bats, skunks and the raccoon epizootic in the eastern United States. Cases have been reported across the United States from California to New York. In New York state, laboratory confirmed rabies cases in opossums occurred five of the ten years between from 1989 to 1998.
Skunks.
In the U.S., there is currently no USDA-approved vaccine for the strain of rabies that afflicts skunks. When cases are reported of pet skunks biting a human, the animals are frequently killed in order to be tested for rabies.
Humans exposed to the rabies virus must begin post-exposure prophylaxis before the disease can progress to the central nervous system. For this reason, it is necessary to determine whether the animal, in fact, has rabies as quickly as possible. Without a definitive quarantine period in place for skunks, quarantining the animals is not advised as there is no way of knowing how long it may take the animal to show symptoms. Destruction of the skunk is recommended and the brain is then tested for presence of rabies virus.
Skunk owners have recently organized to campaign for USDA approval of both a vaccine and an officially recommended quarantine period for skunks in the United States.
Wolves.
Under normal circumstances, wild wolves are generally timid around humans, though there are several reported circumstances in which wolves have been recorded to act aggressively toward humans. The majority of fatal wolf attacks have historically involved rabies, which was first recorded in wolves in the 13th century. The earliest recorded case of an actual rabid wolf attack comes from Germany in 1557. Though wolves are not reservoirs for the disease, they can catch it from other species. Wolves develop an exceptionally severe aggressive state when infected and can bite numerous people in a single attack. Before a vaccine was developed, bites were almost always fatal. 
Today, wolf bites can be treated, but the severity of rabid wolf attacks can sometimes result in outright death, or a bite near the head will make the disease act too fast for the treatment to take effect.
Rabid attacks tend to cluster in winter and spring. With the reduction of rabies in Europe and North America, few rabid wolf attacks have been recorded, though some still occur annually in the Middle East. Rabid attacks can be distinguished from predatory attacks by the fact that rabid wolves limit themselves to biting their victims rather than consuming them. Plus, the timespan of predatory attacks can sometimes last for months or years, as opposed to rabid attacks which end usually after a fortnight. Victims of rabid wolves are usually attacked around the head and neck in a sustained manner.
Foxes.
Recently (probably from the late 90s, by mentions in press) new symptoms of rabies of wild animals have been observed, namely in foxes. Probably at the beginning of the prodromal stage foxes, who are extremely cautious by nature, absolutely lose wild instincts. Animals come into settlements, reach for people, and behave as if tame. How long such "euphoria" lasts is not known. But even in such status the animal is extremely dangerous, as its saliva and excretions still contain the virus. In an August 2008 blog article, one author observed and photographed such a subject.
Monkeys.
Monkeys, like humans can get rabies. However, they tend to die more quickly than humans. In one study, 9 of 10 monkeys developed severe symptoms or died within 20 days of infection.
Other small mammals.
The most commonly infected terrestrial animals in the U.S.A. are raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. Any bites by such wild animals must be considered a possible exposure to the rabies virus.
Most cases of rabies in rodents reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S.A. have been found among groundhogs (woodchucks). Small rodents such as squirrels, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rats, and mice and lagomorphs like rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and are not known to transmit rabies to humans.
In the United States, the most commonly reported rabid animal is the domestic cat. In every year since 1990, reported cases of rabies in cats have outnumbered cases of rabies in dogs.
Transport of pet animals between countries.
Rabies is endemic to many parts of the world, and one of the reasons given for quarantine periods in international animal transport has been to try to keep the disease out of uninfected regions. However, most developed countries, pioneered by Sweden, now allow unencumbered travel between their territories for pet animals that have demonstrated an adequate immune response to rabies vaccination.
Such countries may limit movement to animals from countries where rabies is considered to be under control in pet animals. There are various lists of such countries. The United Kingdom has developed a list, and France has a rather different list, said to be based on a list of the "Office International des Epizooties" (OIE). The European Union has a harmonised list. No list of rabies-free countries is readily available from OIE.
In recent years, canine rabies has been practically eliminated in North America and Europe due to extensive and often mandatory vaccination requirements. However it is still a significant problem in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. Dogs are considered to be the main reservoir for rabies in developing countries.
However, the recent spread of rabies in the northeastern United States and further may cause a restrengthening of precautions against movement of possibly rabid animals between developed countries.

The Shods

The Shods are a punk band from Lowell, Massachusetts who have released five albums and an EP to date. The Shods have a loyal regional following, and remain well known in their home state. 
Origins.
The Shods formed in 1993 in Lowell, MA with musicians Scott Pittman, Roy Costa, and music mainstay Kevin Stevenson, whose other projects included Formicide, Only Living Witness, and Duck Duck. Within a week of forming, the band produced a debut EP titled "I'm in Lowell, MA". In 1995, the band released its debut full-length album "Here Come The Shods" on a self-created label called Poorhouse Records.
Tours.
After recruiting F.J. Ventre on Bass, and Dave Aarnoff on second guitar, work began at Fort Apache Studios on what was intended to be their major label release on MCA. This deal, however, fell through and the band shelved the project until 2001. Also during this time, the band toured around the northeast with fellow Bostonians, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and Stevenson began playing in what became known as the Rivers Cuomo Band.
Health issues.
After many lineup changes during the recording of "Bamboozled" and "Thanks for Nuthin'", The Shods were threatened to come to an end when lead guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Kevin Stevenson learned he was battling multiple sclerosis. Following the tragic news, the band pushed forward by releasing "Tippy" in 2003. Although activity has been mostly stagnant in recent years, past members have returned with founders Kevin Stevenson and Scott Pittman for reunion shows including one in support the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Dropkick Murphys in 2007.

Species.
There are currently two recognized species in this genus: 
"B. dinema" originates from Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. This species grows up to about 100.0 centimetres (39.4 in) TL. "M. dinema" occurs in medium to large-sized rivers and is found from middle depths to the surface in deeper parts of large rivers. This species feeds on smaller fish near the water surface. It is an excellent game fish which can be caught using hook and line. Presently, large numbers are being taken near Stung Treng in Cambodia by explosives. It is marketed fresh or dried and salted.
"B. truncatus" is known from the Mekong and Chao Phraya River basins. This species grows up to 60.0 cm (23.6 in) SL. "B. truncatus" migrates upstream through the Khone Falls in June to July with other silurids and enters the flooded forest in July to October, where it feeds heavily on cyprinids of the genus "Henicorhynchus".

Rumali Roti

Rumali Roti (Hindi: रूमाली रोटी; Urdu: رومالی روٹی) is a thin flatbread popular in South Asia. It is enjoyed with Tandoori dishes and as a traditional element in Mughlai cuisine. The word "rumal" means handkerchief in Urdu and Hindi, and the name "rumali roti" means "handkerchief bread". The bread is extremely thin and supple, and the fact that it is usually served folded like a handkerchief are the probable sources of the name. During the Mughal period, the roti was used like a cloth to wipe off the excess oil off the hands after the completion of an oil-rich food laden with meat and fat. The rumali roti also occupied a unique place in the emblem of the royalty of Oudh under the control of Mughals.
The bread is usually made with a combination of whole and white wheat flours ("atta" and "maida" respectively) and best cooked on top of (on the convex side of) an inverted Indian griddle (kadhai).

Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission

Japan's is a commission established within the Cabinet of Japan as an independent agency to play the main role in nuclear safety administration. Commissioners are appointed by the Prime Minister of Japan on Diet approval. The commission has stronger authority than any other ordinary advisory committees, in that the Commission can make recommendations to relevant agencies in the name of the Prime Minister if it is necessary.
The Nuclear Safety Commission reviews safety inspections conducted by regulatory agencies, such as the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency.
In 2007 the independence of the Nuclear Safety Commission was questioned by seismologist Professor Katsuhiko Ishibashi, after a senior Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency official appeared to rule out a new review of the NSC's seismic design standards.
Madarame Haruki, as Chairman of the Nuclear Safety Commission (2010-2012), was an ardent pro-nuclear advocate. However, his inquiry testimony in the Diet in February 2012, showed that he had become critical of the Commission's approach. He said that "Japan's atomic safety rules are inferior to global standards and left the country unprepared for the Fukushima nuclear disaster last March". There were flaws in, and lax enforcement of, the safety rules governing Japanese nuclear power companies, and this included insufficient protection against tsunamis. He said the nuclear power industry had strenuously opposed adopting stricter international safety standards. He spoke of officials ignoring nuclear risks and said, "We ended up wasting our time looking for excuses that these measures are not needed in Japan". 
Madarame also asserted that Japan’s safety monitoring technology is outdated, while acknowledging that the Nuclear Safety Commission had, "…succumbed to a blind belief in the country’s technical prowess and failed to thoroughly assess the risks of building nuclear reactors in an earthquake-prone country". Regulators and the utilities missed many opportunities to improve operating safety standards and warned that safety regulations are fundamentally inadequate and minimally enforced. He also asserted that regulatory capture was an issue, where regulators had little power and were often subsumed by utility interests. In Madarame’s view, there has been a collective heedlessness about safety and inadequate risk management. 
It was reported that the government plans to merge the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency with the Nuclear Safety Commission, to create a new nuclear safety agency, under the environment ministry, by April 2012. The Nuclear Regulation Authority was created on September 19, 2012.

Tamim al-Dari

Tamim bin Aws al-Dari () (died 661) was a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. 
Biography.
Originally a priest Christian, al-Dari lived in southern Palestine and belonged to the Bani al-Dar—a clan of the Banu Lakhm tribal confederation. His first contact with Muhammad was in 628 CE when he led a delegation of ten other Bani al-Dar members. Previously Muhammad granted Bani al-Dar a part of the revenues of conquered land after the Muslim victory at the Battle of Khaybar. Al-Dari confronted Muhammad to receive the revenues and after meeting him, al-Dari embraced Islam and settled in Medina.
After his conversion, al-Dari became an adviser to Muhammad, particularly on public worship. His advice included the introduction of oil lamps in mosques. In addition to being an adviser, he is traditionally considered to be the first narrator of Islamic religious stories. Many of his stories included ones on the end of the world, beasts and the coming of the Antichrist. His wife thought he was dead a and married to another man. The matter was communicated to Caliph Umar, and he referred it to Ali who said that the Prophet has foreseen all that would happen to Tamim and left the wife to have her own choice between the two husbands. The wife however decided to go back to Tamim al-Dari. 
Prior to Muhammad's death, al-Dari was granted a large fief for control of Hebron, Beit Einun and the surrounding area, although at that time Palestine was still under Byzantine control. The deed was written up by Ali and when the caliph Umar and his Rashidun army conquered Palestine, al-Dari acquired the territory. Since, he had only one daughter and no sons, after al-Dari's death, the heirs of the Hebron fiefdom would be the descendants of his brother Nu'aim. Originally, al-Dari's role as the ruler of the fiefdom was to collect land taxes. He was forbidden to enslave any of the locals or sell their property. In 655 CE, al-Dari left Medina to reside in his native Palestine where he died in 661. According to tradition, he is buried in the town of Bayt Jibrin (in the vicinity of Hebron), destroyed by Israel in 1948.

Henrietta Montalba

Henrietta Skerrett Montalba (1856 – 14 September 1893) was a British sculptor, born into a renowned family of artists. She studied art at what was to become the Royal College of Art with fellow-student The Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll. The Princess painted a portrait of her which today hangs in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada. She first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1876, and her work was often seen at the Grosvenor Gallery in London. Montalba was rarely separated from her family, residing in later days chiefly at the family home in Venice, Italy. She died in Venice, on September 14, 1893, and was buried near her father in the cemetery of San Michele. One of her sculptures, a bronze titled Boy Catching a Crab, is in collection of The Victoria and Albert Museum.
Early life.
Henrietta Montalba was born in 1856, the youngest of four daughters of Anthony Rubens Montalba and Emeline (née Davies), all of whom would attain considerable success as artists. She was born in London. The 1871 British census shows Anthony Montalba living at 19 Arundel Gardens, Notting Hill, London, with four daughters, all artists. Montalba studied first at what was to become the Royal College of Art in South Kensington, and then in the Accademia di Belle Arti at Venice. Later she became a pupil of Jules Dalou, the French sculptor, during his residence in London.
Career.
Montalba first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1876, and her work was often seen at the Grosvenor Gallery, the New Gallery, and elsewhere.
She mainly devoted herself to portrait or fancy busts; some executed in marble, like those of Doctor Mezger of Amsterdam (Grosvenor Gallery, 1886), and Dr. Schollander, the Scandinavian artist; others in bronze, like that of the Marquess of Lorne; but the greater part of her work was executed in terra cotta, as in the case of her bust of Robert Browning (Grosvenor Gallery, 1883). Other works worthy of note were "A Dalecarlian Peasant Woman" and "The Raven," representing a raven seated on a bust of Pallas, from the poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Her last work was of a more ambitious nature, being a life-size figure of "A Venetian Boy Catching a Crab," executed in bronze, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1893, and at the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, in the same year.
Her bronze bust of Richard Burchett, headmaster of the South Kensington Schools, has been transferred to the new building of the Royal Academy of Art, along with its setting designed by George Clausen.
Royal favour.
She was on terms of friendship with her fellow-student Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, who painted a portrait of her and presented it to the Canadian Academy of Arts in Ottawa (now in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada). Both Henrietta and her sister Clara spent time with the Princess in Canada, painting landscapes.
Montalba was rarely separated from her family, residing in later days chiefly at Venice, Italy, and making frequent visits with them in Italy, Sweden, and elsewhere. Besides her artistic gifts she possessed great linguistic talent.
Death and legacy.
In 1892 her health began to fail her, and after a lingering illness she died in Venice, on September 14, 1893, and was buried near her father in the cemetery of San Michele.
One of her sculptures, a bronze titled "Boy Catching a Crab", is displayed in The Victoria and Albert Museum. Her bronze bust of her principal at college, the heavily-bearded painter Richard Burchett, set in an elaborate bronze memorial frame designed by George Clausen, has followed the Royal College of Art to its new Darwin Building on Kensington Gore, where it is installed in a courtyard.

At 19 years old, Jenks moved into an assisted living facility, starring, directing, and producing the feature film "Andrew Jenks, Room 335". While a sophomore at New York University, HBO bought the rights to the film and released the documentary on January 15, 2008. The film premiered in Australia and Europe. The film received mostly positive reviews, Variety calling it 'a lovely and genuine account of generational understanding'.
Andrew Jenks, Room 335 is an example of  a participatory documentary. Jenks' connection to his subjects makes an impact on him as well as them.
"The Zen of Bobby V".
When he was 21 years old, ESPN Films financed Andrew's second film, "The Zen of Bobby V". The film received good reviews after premiering at the TriBeca Film Festival.
Jenks said of the pitch process 'It was me and my two friends - 21 years old, telling ESPN, the 'Worldwide Leader in Sports' that this was a story that had to be told -that it was their duty. I think we left every meeting unsure if we were acting our age, or just showcasing our passion'.
Acclaim as a young director.
At the International Documentary Film Festival at Amsterdam, Jenks was widely acclaimed as one of the next great American filmmakers.
In a review for Jenks' first film, The New York Post said "It's almost impossible to believe that a kid could produce a documentary like this. It's a gorgeous, hilarious, sad, wonderful, unblinking look at the joy of life - even at the end of it...Bravo Andrew Jenks. Brilliant."
At the Phoenix Film Festival in 2006 Jenks said of his documentary celebrity, "When you have characters like Bill and Tammy it's hard for your first film not to be a hit. I am lucky."
"World of Jenks".
In January 2010, MTV signed Jenks to do a documentary-series titled "World of Jenks". Jenks claimed his inspiration behind "World of Jenks" was that "I also want to tell the stories of my generation. I want to be a filmmaker that is able to capture what my generation thinks, how they act and what they ultimately stand for." In each episode, Andrew will move in with a new stranger to experience a week in their life, from random people, such as a homeless woman, a man with autism, a rapper, MMA fighter, a professional poker player, an NFL cheerleader, a female-fronted band, etc. The series premiered September 12, 2010 on MTV. Kid Cudi allowed this show to use his song 'Soundtrack 2 My Life' as its theme song.
Season 2 of “World of Jenks” expanded to hour long episodes and continued to be a ratings hit. MSN remarked, "’Jenks -- like Chad, Kaylin and D-Real -- has overcome the odds and consistently triumphed in its timeslot.”
The award winning show was dubbed as a show unlike any other on MTV. U.S. News & World Report said, “The only way to understand someone else's life is to live it. That's the premise behind documentary filmmaker Andrew Jenks's World of Jenks… The result: a raw, intimate look at daily struggles and victories, and what it means to be a young person today.” USA Today said, “MTV's World of Jenks is one of the few unscripted shows that's actually snark-free and helpful to people … I do like how this series gives a voice to all kinds of teens, not just the pretty ones in fashionable clothes.” 
Jenks was the face MTV’s 2012 election coverage, both producing and hosting. He interviewed or asked questions to nearly all of the candidates, including Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama.
"It's About a Girl".
Jenks is the creator of "It's About a Girl", a magic realism YouTube web series premiered July 9, 2013. He plays a man who pursues the girl of his dreams, played by Taryn Southern.

Activism.
Jenks has teamed up with DKMS and DoSomething to promote teens and college students to join the bone marrow donor registry. He will be participating in college speaking tours where he will try to raise awareness and involvement. He also did a PSA for Do Something with a five-year-old leukemia patient about the importance of "getting swabbed".
Author.

He even autographs some of the books and takes photos.
Future Projects.

Goke, Body Snatcher from Hell

Plot.
Air Japan flight JA307 is en route from Tokyo to Osaka. As stewardess Kuzumi Asakura (Tomomi Sato) announces the flight plan, the pilot notices an unusual red color to the sky around them.
The passengers also see bloody birds flapping their wings against the plane's windows. The pilot (Hiroyuki Nishimoto) receives a radio message stating there may be a bomb aboard and is ordered to return home. Co-pilot Sugisaka (Teruo Yoshida) checks each passenger's bags, saying that a bag with confidential documents may have mistakenly been loaded on this flight. All the bags are cleared but one man (Hideo Ko) had no bag. Kuzumi notices an unaccompanied suitcase under a bench. He opens it and finds a rifle. The man suddenly pulls a gun on Sugisaka and orders the pilot to fly to Okinawa. To show he means business, he shoots out the plane's transistor radio, just as it was breaking the news about a UFO over Japan with Japanese and US Air Force fighters in pursuit. Suddenly, a luminous object appears directly in front of the airplane. It passes overhead but knocks out the airplane's controls, causing an engine fire. The plane crashes on an uncharted desert isle.
Sugisaka wakes up to find the pilot and hijacker are both dead. He and Kuzumi check for more survivors. They find Mrs. Neal (Kathy Horan), an American widow; Senator Mano (Eizo Kitamura) of the Constitutional Democratic Party; weapons exporter Tokiyasu (Nobuo Kaneko) and his wife Noriko (Yuko Kusunoki); Psychiatrist Momotake (Kazuo Kato); space biologist Professor Sagai (Masaya Takhashi); and a young man who called in the bomb threat (whom they lock in the cockpit). Taking stock, they find that they are out of water or food and don’t know where they are.
The hijacker suddenly sits up, grabs Kuzumi and runs out into the jungle. When the others pursue him they come upon the luminous spaceship. Kuzumi hides, but the hijacker steps into a clearing. Suddenly, he goes blank and start shuffling toward the spaceship. A dark blob oozes towards the hijacker, who’s forehead is suddenly split wide open, causing Kuzumi to scream and pass out.
Sugisaka finds the unconscious Kizumi and carries her back to the plane. Dr. Momotake later hypnotizes her to help her tell them what happened. She saw the dark blob crawled into the hijacker's skull through the split in his forehead. Tokiyasu doesn't believe her, but Dr Momotake assures him that Kuzumi is telling the truth. Sagai points out that it could be a flying saucer. Suddenly, the kid who called in the bomb threat goes berserk. He attacks Dr Momotake, who falls off the cliff. Waiting at the bottom is the hijacker. He bites Momotake on the neck and sucks out his blood, turning Momotake bright blue.
Later, the survivors discuss finding water in the morning. Suddenly, there is a knock at the door. Mano and Tokiyasu don't want to open it, but Sugisaka does anyway. As he descends the stairs, he sees the hijacker lying on the ground with a big scar on his forehead. Mrs Neal rushes to the hijacker and begs for the others to help him. Against their better judgement, they carry the hijacker inside and dress his wound.
Mano has become extremely thirsty. When Mano wants a drink of water from Tokiyasu's canteen, he refuses. Mano and Tokiyasu have been helping each other illegally, Tokiyasu funding Mano's campaign and Mano promising to pressure the committee to accept Tokiyasu's weapons bid, a promise that Mano des not intend to keep. Tokiyasu then uses the rifle to force everyone out of the plane and locks himself safely inside, except for the hijacker.
Tokiyasu's screams can be heard outside. Suddenly, they stop and the door swings open. Everyone rushes inside to find Tokiyasu dead, all the blood drained away. Noriko begins to laugh, happy to be free from his abuse, but she starts to cry when she thinks about the way he died. The hijacker later comes out of hiding and carries Noriko off to the spaceship. When they notice her missing, the others go in search of her.
At sunrise Noriko is seen standing on a ridge. She starts to speak, but it is not her voice. It is the Gokemidoro speaking. They have come to invade the earth and to exterminate humanity. The Gokemidoro have no more need for Noriko's body, so she plunges off the cliff. By the time the others get to her, she has disintegrated into a shriveled cadaver.
Once again, the passengers argue about whether extraterrestrials would invade the earth. Professor Sagai theorizes that the hijacker was turned into a vampire. Mano challenges them to prove there are vampires. They decide to sacrifice someone to the Goke. Mano suggests Mrs Neal, because a foreigner will be less problems later, but she’s against the idea. Sugisaka is against all o fit. The kid knocks from the cockpit door, asking for water, so they let him out. Mrs Neal grabs a rifle and locks Sugisaka and Kuzumi into the cockpit. Mano and Saiga shove the kid outside. They watch the hijacker slowly advance. The kid pulls out the bomb he's been hiding and threatens to blow up the plane unless they let him back in. They don't and the bomb goes off, killing the kid and blowing a large opening in the side of the airplane.
It's now evident that the plane no longer provides cover and the bomb blast wounded Professor Sagai. Mano runs off with Mrs. Neal following him. When the hijacker catches up with them, Mano pushes Mrs. Neal to the hijacker to save himself. Neal shoots several times but misses. Finally, the hijacker grabs her, bites her neck and sucks her dry.
Back in the airplane, Sugisaka and Kuzumi are packing up supplies while Sagai bemoans faith in humanity. As Sugisaka assures him there is human goodness, they hear a shout. It is Mano and the hijacker is not far behind. They go to help Mano, but he runs past them, locking the plane door behind him. While Mano watches from inside the plane, Sugisaka tosses a bucket of airplane fuel at the hijacker, then sets him on fire.
The Gokemidoro crawls out of the burning hijacker, creeps in through the bomb hole in the plane and enters Professor Saiga's forehead. Saiga drains Mano, then turns to Sugisaka and Kuzumi, who try to run. Saiga follows until he is swept off a hill by a landslide. Sugisaka and Kuzumi keep running, while Saiga goes back to the spaceship. Once there, the Gokemidoro crawls out, reducing Saiga to dust.
Sugisaka and Kuzumi keep running until they find a highway. Everyone in the cars and nearby city are dead. The Gokemidoro inform them that nothing will be spared.
Epilogue: Sugisaka and Kuzumi are wandering on rocky terrain. In orbit around Earth a whole fleet of Gokemidoro spaceships await.
Influence.
The film is perhaps best known in the United States for its influence on Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill: Volume 1": in the scene where The Bride flies to Japan, the deliberately artificial shots of the airliner flying in front of the backdrop of an orange sky were based on images from "Goke".

He became interested in rocknroll in the late 1950s as a teenager, after hearing artists such as Tommy Steele, Cliff Richard and The Drifters on Radio Luxembourg, which was a usual source for music information of the Yugoslav youths of the time. In the following years, throughout the early 1960s he became a fan of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, and an avid record collector, although, bizarrely, he didn't have a record player yet. He purchased his first one in 1964 together with a group of friends, who were also rock music fans and with whom he participated in his hometown's rock subculture. Although they faced occasional problems with the authorities, they were permitted to use the publicly owned youth cultural centre, such as all major towns in Yugoslavia had, for their musical and artistic activities. There emerged art collectives, youth magazines and a writing workshops led by Glišić, and several local bands were formed, such as Čivije, Slatki Limunovi and Baš Čelik, while concert was held by the prominent group Siluete from Belgrade. Ivan Glišić's favourite artists at the time included: The Who, Pretty Things, The Kinks, The Animals, The Troggs and Them. He was impressed by "the 1960s" social revolution, but gradually became disilusioned with it. His heroes, The Beatles, received MBE by the Queen, and during a certain period, went into what he perceived as escapism under Maharishi's influence, instead of supporting the then vibrant student movement, especially active during the global protests of 1968, which also took place in Yugoslavia, leaving strong impressions on Glišić.
Songwriter.
In the early 1970s, Ivan Glišić became involved in the pop and rock music scene of Zagreb, then Socialist Republic of Croatia, where he cooperated with the notable group Roboti, whose bassist was Rajmond Ruić. As a tandem consisting of Glišić as a songwriter, and Ruić as a composer and arranger, they were active in writing songs for the prominent Croatian pop and rock artists: Josipa Lisac, Time, Darko Domjan and Dalibor Brun, achieving great prominence not only in Croatia, but also in the wider Yugoslav pop and rock scene.
Glišić became so successful that the biggest former Yugoslav major label, the Zagreb-based Jugoton employed him, paying him weekly round trip-airline tickets from Belgrade to Zagreb, providing him accommodation in the most prestige hotels and best recording schedules. Glišić went to Zagreb every Sunday and returned to Šabac every weekend.
Some of his successful hits included "Ulica jorgovana" and "Laku noć, Katarina" performed by Darko Domjan. Glišić also participated in many domestic and international music festivals and was awarded on several occasions.
He joined Nikola Karaklajić, one of the first Yugoslav rock DJ's, who ran a famous radio show on Radio Belgrade called "Veče uz radio" ("An Evening by the Radio"). Glišić wrote the lyrics for the show's "anthem" which was recorded jointly by the groups S.O.S. and Zajedno. The former included Miša Aleksić, also a co-author of the song, while the latter, Bora Đorđević. They both later formed the prominent Serbian rock act Riblja Čorba. The second co-author was Laza Ristovski, the keyboardist of the Bosnian and Yugoslav cult band Bijelo dugme.
During the 1970s, Glišić wrote lyrics for various rock bands, such as: the aforementioned S.O.S., Rondo, Tetrapak, and others. After finishing his university studies, he became a school teacher, and also wrote lyrics for the rock band Mudra sova consisting of his pupils, early teenagers. Initially, the band was successful, it released its first single promoted with a well attended live gig and recorded the material for its first LP. However some media criticised Glišić, claiming that he abused his position for manipulating children, therefore he abandoned the whole thing. Unusually, although he was into pop and rock music, Glišić also began writing songs for pop folk acts as well, including Lepa Brena and her backing band Slatki greh who became very popular across Yugoslavia in the 1980s.
Glišić and Jugoton had a fruitful co-operation, and his royalties were regularly received on his bank account, however as the break-up of Yugoslavia was evidently approaching, he was suggested by Jugoton, which was located in Croatia, to withdraw his payments and transfer them into a bank in his homeland Serbia. Glišić followed the advice, but during the 1990s economic and political turmoil in Milošević's led Serbia, he lost them all.
Literature.
Ivan Glišić is an author of many literary works, some published as books, some in the press, including poetry, prose, essays etc. He also received several literary awards. His works include (Serbian language titles): "Jer znala je mama, mene će skrckati levi elementi", "Zdravo Kolumbo, ovde Amerika", "Plastično lice", "Rock and roll Warriors", "Dogfucker", "Ura, ura, matura", "Loši dečaci", "Ponoćni očajnik", "Čizme slobode", "Mars, punk struggle for life", "La džungla ili Niža rasa", "Diler – Život u svetlosti", "Bure i osame Miloša Crnjanskog", "Mikelanđelo – avanture tela i duha", "Ključ od sebe ili Isidora Sekulić", the series of books titled "Gorila" and many others. He also finished and redacted the posthumous autobiography "Zub šestica" by Dušan Savković. Unusually, Glišić never held a public book promotion, as a result of a bad experience from the early 1970s, when his first poetry book "Svadbarenje" was widthdrawn from the book stores and its promotion was banned. The reason for this was that the book reviewer was Mika Antić, its cover was designed by Milić od Mačve, while the poetry reader at the event should have been Zoran Radmilović, all of whom the communist regime considered suspicious and somewhat dissident at that moment. After becoming affiliated with the punk subculture in the late 1970s, Glišić became one of the first punk writers in Yugoslavia.
Punk.
After graduating university studies and becoming a school professor, Ivan Glišić went to London, UK in the late 1970s on an excursion with his students. There he got acquainted himself with punk rock, new wave and the skinhead subculture, and had an opportunity to watch The Adverts performing live, but also he witnessed the violent clashes between punks and teddy boys. He embraced punk as it reminded him of his youth's music and rebellion, and after returning home, he formed a band called N.T. (an abbreviation for Novi Talas, meaning in Serbian: "New Wave") consisting of some of his students who accompanied him in London, and himself as vocalist. Soon before it recorded its first single, the Mudra sova event described before repeated itself. The group split as the student's parents forbade them from hanging around with Glišić any more, and he was expelled from his workplace. He heavily involved himself in the Yugoslav Punk and hardcore punk scene, publishing D.I.Y. punkzines featuring his punk literature and punk visual art. His favourite groups included: The Damned, Generation X, Dead Kennedys, The Lurkers, Magazine, UK Subs, Rich Kids, The Exploited and others.
During this period Glišić became close friend with Satan Panonski, the controversial punk musician, poet and body artist from Vinkovci area, Socialist Republic of Croatia, notorious not only for his excessive behaviour, stage performance, transvestitism and homosexuality, but also because he was serving in a psychiatric hospital following a homicide he committed. After a mail correspondence, the two met each other on several occasions, whenever the latter was permitted to leave the institution on a time off for socialisation for a good behaviour. One of the meetings took place on a concert performed by the prominent British band Charged GBH. After the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars broke out, they maintained the contact although under very harsh circumstances using the Red Cross as a mediator. According to some media reports, Satan Panonski, embraced nationalist chauvinism, although he was previously known to be uncompromisingly against it. After learning about this, Glišić tried to reach him by phone from Budapest, in neighbouring Hungary, where he went on a Nick Cave concert. He succeeded to find him, and during the conversation, Satan Panonski denied the allegations. However, reportedly, he joined the Croatian forces during the War in Croatia, and he was murdered under still unclear circumstances.
Ivan Glišić opposed the war and supported the opposition represented by "Otpor!" against Slobodan Milošević who ruled the then so called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The struggle resulted with Milošević's fall during the Bulldozer Revolution in 2000. Currently, Glišić is still an active participant in the cultural life of Serbia, including literature, art exhibitions, literary contests etc.

2009 State of Origin series

The 2009 State of Origin series was the 28th time that the annual three-game series between the Queensland and New South Wales representative rugby league football teams was played entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. Queensland won their first two matches to retain the shield and to record 14 series wins, as well as the first time in Origin history that a state had won the series for four consecutive years. Maroon centre Greg Inglis was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as player of the series.
Game I.
For the first time game one of the series was played in Melbourne. The stakes were high for New South Wales in the face of the genuine possibility of a four consecutive series defeat – never yet suffered since the introduction of the three match series format. Blues selectors opted for eight debutantes, dropping fourteen of the seventeen players who appeared in game I of 2008. The new faces were McManus, Jennings, Stewart, Campese, Farah, Creagh, Weyman and Poore.
With abundant talent and experience to choose from, Queensland selectors opted for the international backline who had represented Australia in April against New Zealand, meaning Slater at fullback dislodged incumbent Maroon fullback Hunt to the interchange bench. The entire Queensland squad had previous Origin experience with thirteen of them having represented on six or more occasions.
New South Wales took a 2–0 lead after an early penalty goal but then in the eighth minute an apparent try to their winger Hayne was controversially, though correctly, disallowed after a long video-referee deliberation, as Hayne had clipped the touch line on his way to score. This appeared to rock the confidence of the young Blues squad and soon after Queensland took a commanding lead with a succession of tries to Slater, Inglis and then Thurston. Creagh crossed for the Blues before half-time picking up a pass from Hayne after he had chased a kick. The scoreline was 18–6 at the break.
As the second half kicked off, Inglis struck quickly with a spectacular try from long range to take the score to 24–6 and his tally to two. New South Wales from that point found some structure and the game played more like the traditional origin arm wrestle till Craig Wing made his entrance from the Blues interchange bench at the 53 minute mark. Two minutes later, off a deflected kick, Wing scored to bring New South Wales within twelve and the Blues dummy halves – Wing and Farah double tagging in the role – began to find gaps in amongst the tiring Queensland forwards. In the 69th minute, another lucky kick deflection, this time off Maroons prop Steve Price and into the hands of Farah which was then passed to Hayne, resulted in Hayne's second try and a 24–18 scoreline with 10 minutes to go. However, in the 78th minute, following a handling error from Blues fullback Kurt Gidley, Darius Boyd crossed in the corner after the scrum, to seal Queensland a 28–18 victory and first blood in the series.
The game was watched by a national audience of 3.48 million people which was a record.
Game II.
Despite seven players being struck by a virus 24 hours before kick-off, for Queensland the only change was Willie Tonga who was selected to replace the injured Justin Hodges and to make his first Origin appearance since 2004. Neville Costigan was put on stand-by as 18th man instead of Matthew Scott. This was also the first time ever that every club in the NRL provided a player for State of Origin.
Game III.
Injuries saw Queenslanders Hannant and Civoniceva replaced by Scott and Shillington. Neville Costigan moved from 18th man in game II to an interchange spot replacing Nate Myles.
New South Wales selectors made a number of changes. Kimmorley was brought in to replace Wallace, making the Blues' halves combination the oldest in Origin history. Morris was brought in for Lyon and Ennis brought in for Farah.
Perry, Waterhouse and White, all experienced Origin campaigners, made a return to the side at the expense of Weyman and O'Donnell. Jennings and Poore returned from injury, replacing Monaghan and Kite.
The Blues also took a leaf out of Queensland's book by having past New South Wales Origin players join the pre-match camp to help the team prepare.
Game III saw New South Wales looking down the barrel of not just a fourth straight series win to Queensland, but a clean sweep series. Sam Thaiday and Ashley Harrison were approved to play for Queensland in spite of carrying injuries into the game. The heroes for NSW were Kurt Gidley, playing injured and who hadn't been potent in attack in the first two games, Brett Kimmorley making his first Origin return since game II of 2007 and Anthony Watmough who was tireless in attack and defence.
Queensland took the lead in the 13th minute with a try to Dallas Johnson before Ben Creagh powered over the line six minutes later for the Blues off a short-pass from Watmough. In the 34th minute New South Wales winger David Williams was awarded a try after juggling the ball picked up from a Trent Barrett kick. Thurston lashed out with his boot in desperate defence and kicked Williams in the mouth as he attempted to score. The Blues were thus awarded the first eight-point try in Origin history.
The match was memorable for its hard hitting nature and ferocious defence. All game Watmough, Creagh and Price were hitting the smaller men as they passed or kicked the ball. Kimmorley ran down Greg Inglis with a beautiful tackle that took the giant centre across the touchline and stopped a certain Queensland try and moments later Kurt Gidley did likewise to a runaway Darius Boyd.
The tension was high right to the death. In the 78th minute Jarryd Hayne crossed but the try was disallowed since in the previous play Steve Price had been illegally concussed. After being knocked out by a Brett White punch, Price was "blindsided" on his way down by Trent Waterhouse; he(Price) was then medi-cabbed off several minutes later in a state of severe concussion. Queensland players became particularly incensed by the actions of Justin Poore who appeared to pick up and then let fall to the ground the concussed Price. This act was labelled by some Queensland players as 'a dog act'. Waterhouse became the first Blues player in Origin history to be sent off while Justin Hodges challenged Brett White to a one-on-one fight. White accepted the challenge by way of a nod and can be seen in several alternate angles (as shown on The Footy Show) responding "Come on!", shortly after licking the blood from his lips in a provocative manner. Hodges then signalled for White to come to him and fight, in an attempt to goad White into precipitating a new fight and get sent off, however White ultimately did not accept. Queensland were then awarded a penalty and kicked the ball to New South Wales full back Kurt Gidley who was swamped by Johnathan Thurston, Sam Thaiday, Neville Costigan and Karmichael Hunt. Creagh then pushed Hodges who had come in as support and quickly backpedaled behind his teammates, precipitating a new altercation. Both Creagh and Thaiday were sin binned although the officials were criticised for allowing White, Hodges and Price's replacement to remain on the field. When the fight was finished and Gidley played the ball Williams took the game's final hit-up tackled by Johnathan Thurston which then sparked Michael Crocker to try to fight Blues hooker Michael Ennis before Referee Shayne Hayne broke up their melee and ended the match.

Plays.
Coffin also translated and adapted Milan Uhde's play "Ave Maria, Played Softly" for the stage. This was performed at Performance Network Theatre in Ann Arbor, c. 1985.
Readings and Performances.
Coffin has given many readings in Tbilisi, Georgia and Bucharest, 2012; Kuala Lumpur, Ann Arbor, Boston and the Seattle area, most notably as part of the Its About Time Writing Series, Seattle Public Library, Ballard branch on Nov. 10, 2011 (# 265) with Mac McClure, Mitra Lotfi Shemirani + Bill Carty, and Dec. 10, 2009 (#244) with Oliver De La Paz and Matt Briggs.
Style and Literary Influences.
Coffin's work is characterized by its focus on interpersonal relationships, specifically romantic relationships between men and women and relationships between family members. In his introduction to "Crystals of the Unforeseen", Laurence Goldstein says that her writing, like that of other women writers, often describes "survival and (less often) victory in the war between the sexes."
Coffin is a versatile writer, drawing on multiple genres, and has been recognized for the wide diversity of her works. Her pieces tend to be short; many of the plays are one act in length, and Coffin has written flash fiction and haiku. She clearly enjoys playing with structure—she has written sonnets, acrostics, sestinas, and villanelles—as well as language; her pieces are filled with puns, "one-liners", and a multiplicity of metaphors. Here, Goldstein calls attention to her notable wordsmithing:
"That's what it all comes back to – the timbre of speech, the astonishing succession of tropes that capture our attention. Aristotle said that the talent for figures of speech is the one kind of rhetoric that cannot be learned. And what a pleasure it is to read an author with such mastery over metaphors. The writing sparkles with them:
"You know where you’re headed after you arrive –"
"an empty station where a wind like"
"the desert sighing drifts in one door and"
"out the other, and the remains of windows"
"are glass daggers stuck like teeth in wooden gums…"
After we arrive at the end of the poem, we appreciate better the thematic function of such images, how they form a network that articulates a capacious vision of human experience. But in the process of reading we simply enjoy them for their originality, their superiority to the quotidian language confronting us on the street, in the office, in front of the TV. And the fiction and plays offer us the same pleasures: "a Slavic accent that had clearly been through a British wringer;" "At night he plies on blankets. I’m keeping you under wraps, he says." "I bet you can’t name me a single red-blooded American guy who had even a fraction of a childhood." One could quote forever the one and two-liners that punctuate Coffin's "Crystals of the Unforeseen"."
Coffin's writing is sprinkled with literary allusions (the result no doubt of her graduate education and a career spent teaching English). She has said that she "love to muck around in the loam of language" and that she sometimes prefers to begin with "the 'edges' of a poem fixed" by confining herself to a particular form.
Coffin's work contains intimate (and sometimes uncomfortable) revelations and is chiefly focused on inward perception and self-exploration—if not of the author herself, certainly of her characters. Literary influences would include Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, but also the confessional poets such as Anne Sexton. Coffin's pieces are frequently autobiographical, drawing on personal experience. In a review for the back of "Crystals", Alice Fulton calls attention to "the veracity with which pursues her demons and delights." 
The recurring themes to be found in Coffin's writing of death, sex, and mental illness are also typical of the confessional school. For example, in "Me and Me", Coffin describes a suicide:
Looking only in the glass, I put knife to
flesh as pen to paper, drawing a fine line
from shoulder blade to shoulder blade and then
another down the spine. A thin cross of blood
sprang into view and I relaxed, knowing
police would soon be dancing blue attendance.
Coffin's pieces contain many dark notes. Pain is often paradoxically mixed with humor or conveyed in a sing-songy, deceptively childlike voice that is reminiscent of Sylvia Plath. In "Amelia Mealy Mouth", Coffin writes:
When I dreamed, I dreamed I was a doll.
She knew my whole story but she'd only
tell me the start. This is you, she said, You're in
bed. This is Amelia--She looks like me.
You love Amelia for her bright red hair, and
feel sad, but Amelia feels nothing at all.
The images and tone of voice in Coffin's poem "Zombie" are also Plathlike:
...My zombie blood, slick
with oil, sometimes caught fire and burned all night.
I spoke in riddles, and was known to mutter
to myself. At meals, I kept pats of butter
cooling on my tongue like lozenges.
Goldstein writes that Coffin "reads the tradition as one that virtually excludes a woman writer like herself... the situation of the woman writer... is something like the position of women in poems and stories... it is precarious, contingent, often dependent on men for favors." Coffin usually portrays events and people from a woman's perspective, and her work has been featured in an anthology of women's voices.
There is less emphasis placed on plot in Coffin's writing; or, rather, the plot is principally psychological and verbal. There are rarely more than two (central) characters in her poems, stories, and plays, and most of these are driven by interior monologues and searching dialogue or witty banter rather than physical action.

Latham, Western Australia

Latham is a small town in the Mid West region of Western Australia.
The town is named after a large granite rock, Latham Rock, that is located close to the townsite. The rock was named after an early pastoralist in the region who established a watering place for stock being droved through the area.
The townsite originated as a result of the planned construction of the railway from Wongan Hills to Mullewa in 1913. The Public Works department decided that the area would be suitable as a railway station and a townsite. The railway opened for service in 1915 and the townsite was gazetted in 1917.
The bulk wheat bin was opened in November 1936.
The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.

Carrington College California

Carrington College California, formerly known as Western Career College, is a privately held, for-profit institution of higher education. Carrington College California, along with co-operating division Carrington College, is operated by Carrington Colleges Group, Inc., a subsidiary of DeVry Inc. Carrington College focuses on training students for work in the health care industry and the college and states it closely watches industry trends to determine which skills and specialties are in demand. It has seven campuses in the state of California.
History.
The institution was founded in 1967 in Sacramento, California, as the Northwest College of Medical Assistants and Dental Assistants. The college was established to meet the education needs of the local healthcare community.
In 1969, the College was purchased and underwent its first name change, to "Western College of Allied Health Careers – A Bryman School." The Education Corporation of America (“EdCOA, Inc.”) purchased the college in 1983 and changed its name to Western Career College (WCC). In 1986, WCC opened a second campus in the Bayfair Center in San Leandro, California. The third campus opened in 1997 in Pleasant Hill, California.
WCC earned accreditation by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges in June 2001. In December 2003, U.S. Education Corporation, a California-based company, acquired WCC. WCC expanded in August 2005 by incorporating the operations and programs of Silicon Valley College. SVC was owned by U.S. Education and was nationally accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology (ACCSCT). This merger expanded college locations to Antioch (originally in Walnut Creek), Emeryville and San Jose. The Fremont location of SVC was merged with the WCC San Jose location shortly after the college merger. In September 2008, U.S. Education Corporation was acquired by DeVry Inc.
In 2010, Western Career College changed its name to Carrington College California. This was a rebranding intended to better reflect its health care programs and to align it with Apollo College, also owned by DeVry, which was simultaneously rebranded as Carrington College. DeVry announced the name changes in March 2010; they took effect on June 30, 2010.

<doc id="19709145" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19709145" title="SKUD 18">
SKUD 18

The SKUD 18 is a class of racing sailing boat. It is a lead-assisted skiff with a tube-launched asymmetrical and a modern high performance stayed rig. The boat was created for trials held by the International Association for Disabled Sailing who were looking for a new two person boat for an additional medal allocated to sailing for the 2008 Paralympics.
Background.
The class is an elegant examples of Universal Design and provide a pathway, within the mainstream, for entry level sailors right through to elite competition. Allowing both able-bodied and disabled athletes alike to enjoy this keelboat. More severely disabled sailors will welcome the ability to compete on an equitable level. 
History.
Created as a concept for International Association for Disabled Sailing selected trials for a new boat for new two-person Paralympic competition in Beijing, the SKUD 18 is a strict one design class. Sailors are seated on the centerline for Paralympic events, but the boat can be sailed with or without either of the seats and configured to suit different sailors’ needs. Perfect for training younger sailors before they move into high performance skiffs or dinghies, the SKUD18 is also ideal for those not-so-young sailors who cannot hike like they used to but still want the excitement of high performance racing.
Design.
The SKUD 18 is a result of collaboration between Chris Mitchell of Access Sailing and Julian Bethwaite of Bethwaite Design, both in Australia, along with Argentine naval architect Martin Billoch. By combining Mitchell's unique experience and ideology of ‘sailing for everyone’ with 20 years of Bethwaite research and technology, the result is an innovative lead assisted skiff (LAS), the SKUD 18.
"“The design evolved as a 5.8m LAS, capable of carrying weight whilst maintaining a high level of performance and control. Cost has been kept low, is easy to stack and containerize, requires simple maintenance and offers ease of use. The boat will be a challenge for able-bodied and disabled sailors alike. The SKUD 18 has been designed from a performance basis to offer scintillating, crisp and snappy response to sailors regardless of their mobility.”" - Julian Bethwaite, designer of the Olympic class 49er skiff
"“The SKUD 18 is very versatile and can be handled by a variety of crew configurations. The helmsperson can transfer manually and be steering with tillers, or be in a fixed seat on the centreline using a manual joystick, push/pull rods, or a servo assist joystick with full control of all functions. The forward crew can either be seated on the centreline, transferring manually, or on trapeze. As the name reflects, the SKUD 18 is a SKiff of Universal Design and can be sailed for fun or serous competition by people of all levels of physical ability.”" - Chris Mitchell, designer of a range of accessible sailcraft
Universal Design.
Universal Design is related to ""inclusive design"", ""design for all"" and "“accessible design”". Universal Design differs from accessible design as accessible design means products and buildings that are accessible and usable by people with disabilities. Universal design means products and buildings that are accessible and usable by everyone—older people as well as young, women as well as men, left-handed persons as well as right-handed persons. It acknowledges disability, aging, and other differences as a part of everyday life.
SKUD 2P in Paralympic format.
Adaptations for Disabled people.
"“The purpose of servo systems is to allow the more severely disabled people to sail and to level up the playing field.”" - Chris Mitchell, SKUD 18 servo assist system developer
Servo motors sailboats are generally used to allow people with mobility problems to enjoy the freedom and independence of sailing by themselves, sailing solo, something that many don’t achieve in any other aspect of their lives. On two-person boats like the SKUD 18, the helmsperson may be a severely disabled sailor (SDS) so needs servo assisted steering, while the crew would generally control the sheets. But it is achievable to have a full servo system so that the SDS helmsperson can adjust sheets and other controls like the cunningham and outhaul as well. Access Sailing Systems servo assist equipment can easily be converted for manual use by disengaging the steering winch clutch and winding out all but a few inches of sheet and then hauling in the sheets by hand. On the SKUD 18, sheets are double ended and can be readily adjusted in either mode.
With its debut in the 2008 Paralympics, this was the first of the 3 keelboat classes to use a spinnaker, as well as the first Paralympic class to specify a severely disabled sailor and a female in the crew, with both sailors secured (with quick release) to their centerline seats for safety purposes. With its 140 kg bulb and 1.7m draft, the 2-person SKUD 18, even with both crew on the centerline, has exceptional stability and is fail safe. Important considerations in being fail safe with a Severely Disabled Sailor (SDS) aboard in the worst situation, i.e., where the boat is broached/ lying on its side in wild conditions:
SKUD Manufacturers.
The SKUD 18 is built by Extreme Sailing Products in Batam, Indonesia for Access Sailing Systems. Run by two Australian boatbuilders, Tim Ross and Paul Paterson, XSP also produce the 49er, 29er, Tasar, Byte, 420, Optimist and a number of other classes. XSP were selected for their consistent high standards of workmanship and their efficient distribution location via Singapore.
Access Class Association.
The SKUD is managed by the Access Class Association which also administers the Access 2.3, Access 303 and the Access Liberty
Events.
Paralympics.
Sailing has been part of the Paralympic Games since 1996 and detailed information on each sailing event can be found on the following pages.
For the SKUD 18 class it debuted in Qingdao, China during the 2008 Summer Paralympic Games. Eleven nations competed on the 2-person keelboat, namely host country China, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Portugal, Sweden, and the United States.
The entries criteria require at least one member of the crew to be female. This led to the first three women who've won Paralympic medals in sailing. Sailing competition athletes and full results.
""I'm very pleased to be the first woman ever to win a gold medal in Paralympic sailing.""
- Maureen McKinnon-Tucker

Plot.
The story is set in the beginning of the 19th century, an era that Hasseåtage thought was very much like the 1960s.
A gang of people from the upper classes has withdrawn to a place in the country were they plan to live for a couple of days, listening to Schubert music and simply enjoy life. 
The plan goes very wrong however, when most of the things go wrong and the company runs out of food and drinks in a couple of days. 
Music.
All music in the show were based on music already written by Franz Schubert with new lyrics written by Hans Alfredsson and Tage Danielsson. 
The songs used in the show are as follows:
First Act.
(Die Forelle, D. 550).
Second Act.
(Nr. 3, from 3 Klavierstücke, D 946).
(Waltz nr six from Twelve Waltz, op. 18, D. 145).
(6:th Symphony, Second Movement).
(First and Second waltz from Twelve Waltz, op. 18, D. 145).
(Ouvertyr from Rosamunda).
(Theme from the "unfinished" 8th Symphony, First movement).
Reception.
The stageplay, although popular by the public, got very bad reviews from the press. The TV-version however gave the show recognition among both public and critics. Those who had been negative about the stageplay and written harsh reviews on it gave very positive response to the other version of the show.

New South Wales X100 class locomotive

The X100 class were a group of rail tractors built by Chullora Railway Workshops in 1962 and operated by the New South Wales Government Railways of Australia.
History.
A need existed for a small shunting unit that could handle the requirements at the smaller junction marshalling yards, larger intermediate stops and the workshop needs. To resolve this, the X100, and later X200s, was designed and built entirely in the system's own workshops from the early 1960s.
X100 class were two 0-4-0 centre-cab diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotives built at the New South Wales Government Railways' Chullora Railway Workshops.
They were delivered in 1962 as the 80 class locomotives, but were re-classified as Shunting Tractors and renumbered X101 and X102 before being allotted to Wauchope and Coffs Harbour.
Originally painted in a crimson red and cream colour scheme, they were later repainted in the standard Indian red with chrome lining.
Photos dated 1977 and 1983, show X102 in an all-over chrome yellow paint scheme and working in the Sydney area. X101 was in an all-over Indian-red scheme in 1979 and working at Wauchope.
X101 is now part of the State Rail Authority Heritage Fleet and is being restored by the Historic Electric Train Society at Eveleigh Carriage Workshops. X102 finished its service at the Petersham Training School and is now preserved at the Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum.
They were confined to yard limits due to a lack of a "train brake" and as such could not be operated in the same way as regular locomotives. This limitation, and a need for greater tractive effort, lead to the development of the larger and more power X200 class.

In the essay, Le Clézio conducts an inquiry into the brutal disappearance of the indigenous cultures of Mesoamerica in the 16th century, particularly the end of the Mexican civilization at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors.
The author analyses the personalities of characters such as Hernán Cortés, La Malinche, Moctezuma II, Cuauhtémoc, and other key players in the conquest of Mesoamerica. He refers extensively to the descriptions offered by Bernal Díaz del Castillo in his "Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España" in analysing the events. He imagines what might have happened if the native populations had not been reduced to silence by brutality, and what their impact on western civilization might have been. Understanding that the West holds both economic and cultural sway over the contemporary world because of the colonization of America, he wonders how the cultural life of Mesoamerica – particularly that of the Aztecs – would have evolved if the arrival of the Europeans had not decimated the indigenous socieites through war, disease and slavery.

Joan FitzGerald, Countess of Carrick

Joan FitzGerald, Countess of Carrick (c. 1282 – before 2 May 1320) was an Irish noblewoman, and the wife of Edmund Butler, Earl of Carrick, Justiciar of Ireland (1268 – 13 September 1321). She was the mother of James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond.
Family.
Joan FitzGerald was born in Fermoy, Co. Cork, Ireland, in about 1282, the daughter of John FitzThomas FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare, Baron of Offaly, and Blanche de La Roche. She had two brothers, Gerald (died 1303), and Thomas FitzGerald, 2nd Earl of Kildare (died 5 April 1328), who married Joan de Burgh (c. 1300 – 23 April 1359), daughter of Richard Og de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster and Margaret de Burgh of Lanvalley, by whom he had issue. Joan had one sister, Elizabeth, who married Nicholas Netterville, by whom she had issue.
Joan FitzGerald's paternal grandparents were Thomas FitzMaurice FitzGerald and Rohesia de St. Michael, and her maternal grandparents were John de La Roche, Lord of Fermoy, and Maud de Waleys (Walsh). The latter was a daughter of Henry le Waleys (The Welsh).
Marriage and issue.
In 1302, Joan married Sir Edmund Butler, Earl of Carrick, the son of Theobald le Botiller (1242–1285) and Joan FitzJohn (FitzGeoffrey) (died 4 April 1303). The marriage produced two sons:
In 1307, Sir Edmund and Joan's father dispersed rebels in Offaly who had burnt the town of Leix and destroyed the castle of Geashill.
In 1315, Sir Edmund Butler was appointed Justiciar of Ireland.
That same year, in July, Joan's husband and her father led the Munster and Leinster contingent of armed forces who were allied with the combined armies of Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster and Felim mac Aedh Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht against the Scottish and Irish troops of Edward Bruce who had been crowned King Of Ireland at Carrickfergus. They were repelled by Bruce, at the River Bann near Coleraine and forced to retreat. Sir Edmund, due to lack of supplies, returned to Ormond.
Edward Bruce was later killed in 1318, at the Battle of Faughart.
On 1 September 1315, for services against the Scottish raiders and Ulster rebels, Edmund Butler was granted a charter of the castle and manor of Karryk Macgryffin and Roscrea to hold to him and his heirs "sub nomine et honore comitis de Karryk". However, the charter, while creating an Earldom, failed to make Edmund Butler's issue Earls of Carrick.
Joan's father, John FitzThomas FitzGerald, died a year later on 10 September 1316, several months after being created Earl of Kildare by King Edward II.
Death.
Joan FitzGerald died on an unknown date sometime before 2 May 1320 in Laraghbryan, Co. Kildare. She was the ancestress of the Earls of Ormond, the queen consort Anne Boleyn, her sister Mary Boleyn and Diana, Princess of Wales.

14&quot;/45 caliber gun

The 14"/45 caliber gun, known initially as the Mark 1, 2, 3, and 5, and later as the Mark 8, 9, 10, and 12, were the first 14-inch guns to be employed with the United States Navy. They were installed aboard the United States Navy's , , and s as the primary armament for each battleship in the class. The gun also saw service in the British Royal Navy, where it was designated the BL 14 inch gun Mk II.
History.
The design of the 14"/45 caliber dates to about 1910, and they entered service in 1914 aboard . At the time of their introduction they were intended to fire 1400 lb armor-piercing (AP) projectiles containing a bursting charge of explosive D. Propellant charge was four silk bags of smokeless powder, each of which weighed 105 lb. At a 15 degree angle, the guns could fire a shell out to 23,000 yards. Each individual gun weighed 140,670 lbs without the breech and measured 642.5 inches in length.
Each of the original Mark 1 built-up guns consisted of a tube without liner, jacket, eight hoops and a screw box liner. To compensate for the problem of gun drooping, four hoop-locking rings were added to the guns. The Mark 3 added three hoop locking rings and contained a longer slide, while the Mark 5 had five hoops total. Owing to the interchangeability of the guns, the battleships fitted with the 14"/45 caliber guns often had guns of various Marks installed on each turret.
Service.
The guns on the two ships of the ( and ), the first ship of the () and the first ship of the () saw service in World War II in the role of shore bombardment. "New York" bombarded North Africa during landings in 1942, "Pennsylvania" took part in the Aleutian Islands Campaign and "Texas" and "Nevada" shelled Normandy during Operation Overlord in 1944. Throughout 1944 and 1945, "Pennsylvania" hit many different Pacific islands during their invasions, while "New York", "Texas" and "Nevada" all took part in the invasion of Iwo Jima and the invasion of Okinawa in 1945.
Due to the attack on Pearl Harbor, both and never fired their main batteries in anger. However, the 14"/45 caliber guns salvaged from the number 2 turret aboard "Arizona" were removed and installed aboard "Nevada" in the fall of 1944.
United Kingdom service.
Eight US-Navy standard 14-inch 45 caliber guns, complete with mountings, built by Bethlehem Steel, were supplied to the United Kingdom in World War I. They were mounted on monitors under the British service designation BL 14 inch gun Mk II.

In his 2008 volume "Revolutionary Spirits: The Enlightened Faith of America's Founding Fathers" (BlueBridge Publishing), Kowalski sought to show that the Founding Fatherss of the United States were neither devout Christians nor secularists but that their views combined religion with the new scientific and intellectual discoveries of the Enlightenment.
A graduate of Harvard College and the Harvard Divinity School, Kowalski was the senior minister of Burlington's First Unitarian Universalist Society for over 20 years. While there, he performed about 25 marriage ceremonies each year, including same-sex marriages because Kowalski said that the church should support all long-term, mutually committed relationships.

Campeonato Regional Centro

Campeonato Centro (also known as Trofeos Mancomunados from 1932 to 1936) was the most important regional football competition for clubs based in the community of Madrid in the first half of the 20th century. 
History.
The competition was originally founded in 1903 and ran by the local Madrid Football Federation ( or FMF). From 1903 to 1913 it was referred to as "Campeonato de Madrid" and was open to clubs based in the community of Madrid.
In 1913 the Royal Spanish Football Federation ( or RFEF) was established to govern competitions at the national level and the FMF was re-established as one of its regional branches, named "Federación Castellana de Fútbol" (FCF). As part of the country-wide reorganisation the competition was also re-established as "Campeonato Regional de Madrid". In the following years it was one of the four regional competitions used as a qualifying phase for the Spanish Cup (which acted as the national championship of Spain until the foundation of La Liga in 1929). The four regional competitions were territorially organized as follows:
With minor changes in territorial organization and several renamings (see below), these four regional competitions were contested until 1940 when it was disbanded during Franco's dictatorship.
Format changes.
From 1903 to 1913 the competition was contested by clubs from Madrid. From the 1913–14 season onwards it expanded to include teams from six neighboring provinces (Ávila, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara, Segovia and Toledo). The territorial format remained largely unchanged until the last season in 1939–1940, with minor changes listed below.

The Gun is a novel by C.S. Forester about an imaginary series of incidents involving a single eighteen-pound cannon during the Spanish Peninsular War (1807-1814) against Napoleon Bonaparte. It was first published in 1933.
As the story begins, the huge bronze cannon is abandoned by the remnants of a Spanish army retreating after their defeat in Battle of Espinosa. The local people employ it in their rebellion against the French, but are eventually forced to hide it away beneath a pile of stone to prevent its capture. Years later, a group of guerrilleros learn of its location and conscript the locals to outfit it with carriage and train. Over time, the gun is used in battle with ever-increasing success. It falls under the control of a series of guerrilla leaders; each achieves strong leadership through his connection to the gun, and each is eventually killed in some way (captured and executed, killed in battle, killed by rival leaders), until the gun finally comes under the control of the 18-year-old Jorge, who emerges as an untrained but naturally gifted leader and tactician. The exploits of the Spanish irregulars under Jorge eventually lead to the diversion of a large body of French troops from their fight against Wellington and thus help win the war.
The book vividly portrays the violence of combat and the brutality displayed by both sides in the Peninsular War.

Leges palatinae

The Leges palatinae ("Palatine Laws") were the laws governing the functioning of the royal court of the Kingdom of Majorca, promulgated by James III at Palma on 9 May 1337. The "Leges" were probably conceived to lend weight to James's position as an independent king. The "Leges" are preserved in an illuminated manuscript with colourful images by an Italian artist of the court officers about their duties. The "Leges" were translated from Latin and revised as the Catalan "Ordenacions de cort" by Peter IV of Aragon, after he conquered Majorca, in 1344. 
The original manuscript was brought with James III to France when he fled Peter's invasion. He there gave it to King Philip VI. It was later given to Philip the Bold and ended up in the Bibliothèque Royale in Brussels. A facsimile edition by Joan Domenge i Mesquida, with an introduction in English describing the artistic value of the manuscript, was published by Indiana University Press in 1994. 
The "Leges" are divided into seven sections and are "the most elaborate set of ordinances to survive from this period. Much of the text is spent explaining the roles of the four great officers of state: the majordomo (or "maître d'hôtel"), great chamberlain (or "camerlingue"), the chancellor, and the "maestre racional" (also "maître des comptes" or "maître rational"). The lesser officers included the butler, marshal, and constable. The majordomo was in charge of maintaining court protocols and oversaw the king's table, much like the later "grand maître d'hôtel" in Valois Duchy of Burgundy. The chancellor, the vice-chancellor, and the scribes of the chancery were accorded the right to issue documents pertinent to their offices without the prior permission of the king. The subsection "De mimis et joculatoribus" ("On actors and entertainers") prescribes two trumpeters, a drummer, and two other performers permanently at court. They played when the king arrived at dinner, when he left the table, and at the end o the meal; an early version of "Tafelmusik".

The Ashland Academy of Art

The Ashland Academy of Art was an art school located in Ashland, Oregon, United States. The Ashland Academy of Art was a classically based, independent school. The Academy's program was mainly based on the Russian Academic System. This system followed the artistic achievements of the Renaissance, developed and practiced by European academies until the end of 19th century.
The Ashland Academy's curriculum combined academic art education with the latest advancements in psychology of visual perception. The Academy's drawing curriculum was rooted in the Construction Method. This analytical method emphasizes a sculptural approach to form, by studying comparative measurements, structure, planes, function, and perspective. 
History.
After the advancement of 20th century modernism, traditional art was rejected by European and American art schools. During this time, Soviet-Russian Art Academies built their program on the best features of classical European academies, adding a tremendous body of theoretical work, uniquely developed by Russian artists-teachers of eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, continued and expanded into the twentieth century.
Preserving this unique academic system, Semyon Bilmes, founder of Ashland Academy of Art, brought this knowledge directly to his students. Semyon Founded the Bilmes Art School in 1990 in Medford, Oregon. In 2003, Semyon Bilmes founded The Ashland Academy of Art.
In 2004, the Ashland Academy was listed as one of Art Renewal Center Approved Ateliers.
The school was located in the former Temple Emek Shalom synagogue.
In late 2009, the Bilmes Family announced that the Ashland Academy of Art would close its doors in October 2010, with the faculty and some of the students relocating immediately to a then unspecified facility in Portland, Oregon, where the school's classes would continue, uninterrupted.
In February 2010, Semyon Bilmes announced that instead of moving to Portland, Oregon, he would relocate to Hawaii and take only ten students with him. According to the Ashland Academy of art website, "With a new name and a new location, Atelier Maui will bring superior classical European instruction in painting and drawing to a lush tropical paradise."

Breeding in the aquarium.
Though Peacock Gudgeons are peaceful, take care that during breeding, there is enough room in your aquarium or males and females become aggressive. A minimum of 10 gallon (or 40 liter) tank is recommended for a group of 4-5 at maximum.
With Peacock Gudgeons, males have a pronounced forehead or a bump as some may call it. Females have a black stripe at the edge of the dorsal and anal fin. Feeding them live food such as Grindal Worms and White Worms should induce them to spawning mood. Putting PVC pipes as breeding spots will help the male with its guarding.

Martha Colburn

Martha Colburn is a filmmaker and artist. She is best known for her animation films, which are created through puppetry, collage, and paint on glass techniques. She has made over forty films since 1994. Colburn has also been fervently involved in playing music. One out of numerous groups she has been a part of is The Dramatics, a band she formed in Baltimore with Jason Willett. Recently in her career, Colburn has made sculptural/video installation work and experimented with integrating her films with musical performance. Yet music and film have always shared a deep connection within Colburn’s work. She is represented by Horton Gallery in New York City.
Biography.
In 1990, Colburn left the Appalachians to attend the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore. Her primary focus in school was visual arts, yet she also began to become involved in the Baltimore experimental music scene. Although disillusioned by the time she graduated in 1994, Colburn nevertheless decided to stay in Baltimore and further immerse herself in the city’s artistic community.
It was around the time of finishing college that Colburn first began to work with film. Her motivation to work with film arose partially from finding 16mm reels of old educational movies. "Acrophobic Babies" and "Feature Presentation" are two early examples of Colburn working within this process. By scratching, tinting, and splicing the film itself, Colburn made her first filmic pieces through her manipulation of appropriated imagery.
After discovering Super-8 in 1995, Colburn switched from 16mm to 8mm. Her initial explorations in puppetry and animation are simultaneous with her shift in film formats. "Caffeine Jam" is one of her first animated films, while "Killer Tunes" is animation using marionettes. Colburn continues to develop and enrich her animation to an even greater complexity of form, materials, and concepts. During an interview with "Metropolis M Magazine", Colburn asserted her love for animation: “animation is magical, it’s making gold out of glitter.”
After ten years of living in Baltimore, Colburn moved to Amsterdam in 2000 after being offered a two-year residency at the Rijksakademie. During her residency, Colburn made numerous films including "Skelehellavision", an animated and hand-colored film mixing images of female pornography stars and skulls, and "Big Bug Attack", a film whose soundtrack was a collaborative piece between Colburn and German techno artist Felix Kubin. Once finishing up her residency, Colburn spent another three years in Holland making films until returning to the United States in 2005.
Once settling between Long Island City, New York and Amsterdam, NL, Colburn began work on films that dealt more closely with American history and its relationship to the country’s foreign and domestic policies. "Destiny Manifesto" incorporates images of the American frontier with depictions of the conflict in the Middle East. "Meet Me in Wichita" is a parody of The "Wizard of Oz" in which Osama Bin Laden substitutes for all of Oz’s characters aside from Dorothy, the story’s heroine. “I am making films that work with ideas of the loss of faith, obsession with spectacle, self destructiveness, compulsion for violence,” Colburn said in Metropolis M Magazine about her work of most recent years. “Inhibition and fear characterize my work, as uninhibited and fearless they may appear.” As far as the effects of returning to her native country after spending time in Europe, Colburn believes her work has gotten increasingly concerned with political issues facing the world today.
Colburn has also used animation for music videos. She created pieces to accompany the San Francisco-based band Deerhoof’s song “Wrong Time Capsule” in 2005 and Serj Tankian’s “Lie, Lie, Lie” in 2007. Yet these projects come as no surprise given the strong relationship Colburn has always had with music. She even created animation for the 2005 documentary about the musician Daniel Johnston entitled The Devil and Daniel Johnston. Colburn’s latest film, Myth Labs, has not just been screened, but also presented as panels of which the film is composed.
Collage work.
Colburn’s style of collage fuses pop culture and political imagery with an aesthetic that is simultaneously fantastical, painterly, and punk rock. Many of her appropriated images are painted over with a diverse variety of paints which integrate them with the drawings and textures that are completely her own. Colburn animated by facing the camera directly downward at the collaged panels below. The “hands-on,” non-technological quality that defines her process keeps her films at a personal and intimate level. Color is another very important aspect of Colburn’s films. Although her 2006 film Meet Me in Wichita deals with disconcerting subject matter, Colburn still chooses bright colors to define the film’s color scheme. It is these types of contradictions in Colburn’s work which deepen her visual and conceptual complexity. Colburn was featured in the April 2011 issue of Art In America.

Hollywood Hotel (film)

Hollywood Hotel is a 1937 American romantic comedy film, directed by Busby Berkeley. It stars Dick Powell, Rosemary Lane, Lola Lane, and Ted Healy. Ronald Reagan, Benny Goodman and Harry James (a member of Goodman's band) also appear. 
It is best remembered for the featured song and opening number "Hooray for Hollywood" by Johnny Mercer and Richard A. Whiting, sung in the film by Johnnie Davis and Frances Langford, accompanied by Benny Goodman and his orchestra. The song has become a standard part of the soundtrack to movie award ceremonies, including the Academy Awards. Mercer's lyrics contain numerous references, often satirical, to the movie industry and the path to film stardom.
Plot.
Saxophone player and singer Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell), is on his way to Hollywood, having been signed to a ten-week contract by All Star Pictures. At the airport, his former employer, Benny Goodman, and his band give him a big sendoff, performing "Hooray for Hollywood". 
In Hollywood, temperamental star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) becomes furious when she learns that another actress has landed the part she desperately wanted. As a result, she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest movie. Publicist Bernie Walton (Allyn Joslyn) convinces studio boss B. L. Falken (Grant Mitchell) to substitute a double. After looking over a number of women, Bernie chooses Virginia Stanton (Rosemary Lane), who has already worked as a stand-in for Mona. For her escort, Bernie chooses an unsuspecting (and starstruck) Ronnie.
The charade works. Everyone, from Ronnie to Louella Parsons to the radio host at the premiere (an uncredited Ronald Reagan in his second film appearance), is fooled. Things take an unexpected turn when Ronnie and Virginia begin to fall in love, wading in a fountain pond and singing "I'm Like a Fish Out of Water". 
The next day, Bernie takes Ronnie to lunch at the restaurant where Virginia is working as a waitress, to break the news of his date's real identity. Ronnie and Virginia begin dating.
When Mona reads in the newspaper that "she" was at the premiere with Ronnie, she forces Falken to release the young man from his contract. Photographer Fuzzy Boyle (Ted Healy) appoints himself Ronnie's agent, and they make the rounds, trying to get his acting career started without success. The two end up employed at a drive-in. When Ronnie sings during work, director Walter Kelton (William Davidson) is impressed and offers him a job. Ronnie is disappointed to learn, however, that he will not be acting (in Mona's next picture). Kelton only wants him to dub the singing for Mona's longtime screen partner, Alex Du Prey (Alan Mowbray).
Du Prey's "singing" impresses the audience at the preview. When Louella Parsons invites Du Prey to perform on her radio program, he accepts without thinking. Desperate, All Star Pictures pays Ronnie an exorbitant fee to sing for the actor. However, Ronnie has his own ideas. Virginia (posing as Mona) picks up Du Prey in a limousine driven by Fuzzy. The pair drive him out into the countryside so he misses the program. Ronnie substitutes for Du Prey and is a hit. Falken decides to resign him, at a much larger salary.
Production.
Louella Parsons, a famous gossip columnist, created the concept of "Hollywood Hotel" and appears in the film as herself. Ronald Reagan began to know Parsons on the set.

The concept of the arborloo toilet is collect feces feces in a pit, and subsequently grow e.g. a fruiting tree in this very fertile soil.
The arborloo works by temporarily locating the slab and superstructure above a shallow pit while this fills. When the pit is nearly full (3/4) superstructure and slab is relocated to newly dug pit and the old pit is covered and left to compost. The old site used a bed for fruit tree or other, this is preferable planted during rainy season.
The arborloo can be considered a simple form of composting toilet. In using the nutrient rich soil of a retired pit the arborloo in effect treat feces as a resource rather than a waste product. In this the arborloo both addresses issues with sanitation and provide increase crop output.

The defecation pit may be circular or square and this may depend on the slap and superstructe. It is worth noting that a circular pit is less likely to collapse. The pit of the arborloo is shallow (between 1-1.5 meter).
If the pit is dug by hand it must have a diameter/width of at least 0.9 meters to accommodate effective digging. The pit should not be wider than the slab and must allow for 0.1 meter bearing around the edge.

Club Regent Casino

Club Regent Casino is a casino located in Winnipeg, Manitoba. It is one of two casinos in the city (the other being the McPhillips Street Station Casino), both are owned and operated by the Manitoba Lotteries Corporation, and in turn, the Government of Manitoba. The casino opened in 1993, after an assessment regarding the distribution of gambling revenue, was released. Connected to the casino is the Canad Inns Club Regent Hotel.
The casino and hotel are located in the Winnipeg neighborhood of Transcona on Regent Avenue, and is 15 km (25 minute drive) from the Winnipeg International Airport. The casino contains a McDonald's restaurant, as well as a concert stage, on which regular comedy, and musical performances are scheduled. The casino claims its decorative style is Caribbean, but some of the interior decorations would be more accurately attributed to Aztec, Mayan, or other Mesoamerican locations. The exterior of the building is surrounded in artificial palm trees.
Casino.
The gaming area of the casino is divided into two main areas. The first area (which is entered from the south or east entrance), contains a large amount of VLT machines, slot machines, a McDonald's restaurant, as well as a large stage for bingo (which also doubles as the concert stage). The first area of the casino is connected to the second area via an Aquarium tunnel, which contains many exotic salt-water fish. 
The second area of the casino contains another section of VLTs, slot machines, and a Table Game area. The table games include Blackjack, Red Dog, Texas Hold'em Bonus Poker, Roulette, Baccarat, Pai gow poker, and Let it ride. Three card poker was offered until early 2009, when it was replaced with Red Dog. Next to the Table Game area is a large Poker area, which contains multiple 10-seat poker tables.
In this second area of the casino, there is a large bamboo-styled spiral staircase, which leads downstairs. Before 2007, the Poker area was located downstairs, before being moved upstairs next to the Table Games. This allowed for additional poker tables, and more room. While the poker area was downstairs, the Manitoba Gaming Control Commission only allowed the casino to run Fixed-Limit poker games. Shortly after this move, the Manitoba Gaming Control Commission approved the casino to run No-Limit poker games. Currently the poker area runs $1/$2 No limit Texas hold 'em games, but higher limits are available upon player request. Aside from the cash poker games facilitated, the casino also runs regular Poker Tournaments.
Hotel.
The Club Regent Casino Hotel is owned an operated by Canad Inns, a Winnipeg hotel chain. The hotel contains 146 guest rooms, as well as an indoor pool. The hotel has a 3-diamond rating from AAA/CAA, and a 4-star rating from Canada Select. The hotel also has a 3-Green Key rating from the Hotel Association of Canada's Green Key Eco-Rating Program.

Worlds chat

Worlds Chat is an on-line virtual reality based chat program introduced in April 1995 by the company Worlds Inc. and as of February, 2014 is still running. At the time of Worlds Chat's release, Worlds Inc. was in its second year of existence and already a leader in creating virtual workspace environment having created virtual meeting spaces for clients such as Sprint, Intel, and UB Networks. Worlds Chat was the first program they made available to the general public and it was offered free of charge for download to from their website. The popularity of the program and Worlds Inc.'s other successes, such as Tamiko Thiel's work with Steven Spielberg to create Starbright World (a virtual world for seriously ill children), allowed Worlds Inc. to procure a minority investment of $5.6m from Pearson plc in June 1995.
User Interface.
The Worlds Chat user was allowed to choose from a gallery of existing three-dimensional avatars to be their representation in the virtual world. The gallery, like the rest of the game, was presented in a fashion similar to that of a first person shooter, less the hands and weapon in the view port. Once an avatar was chosen, the user was then placed in a central hub of a virtual space station. The user could see representations of the other online users who were in the same area of the "space station". Users could exit a platform, through sliding doors, travel through halls and find other platforms with groups of people to interact with. The screen was split into several areas including one for messages from the software program itself, a window with a Doom (video game) like 3d interface, a window for chat messages and a space station map indicating which platform the user currently inhabited. Both a keyboard and mouse were integral parts of the user interface.
Technical Challenges.
The first release of the VRML, a standard for defining virtual reality environments, was less than six months old when Worlds Chat was released. This meant that World's Inc. needed to discover and define its own best practices while creating Worlds Chat. The additional speed of dial-up Internet connections naturally placed limitations on the amount of information that could be transmitted to and from the Worlds Inc. servers. An increasing number of users and expanding virtual world increased these pressures. 
Tamiko Thiel, a creative director and producer and Worlds Inc. from 1994 to 1996, wrote an article entitled "Cyber-Animism and Augmented Dreams" describing the history of virtual worlds, in which she wrote::
"In the virtual worlds and avatar communities in the mid 1990's we thought we all would start parallel, virtual, online existences in which we could create ourselves anew and realize our personal dreamworlds. The technology however was too awkward, the processors and the Internet connections too slow, and the user base for our worlds never extended beyond a small dedicated community. By 2002 the virtual communities of the first generation all went bankrupt or looked for other ways to earn money."

Nicholas Gruner

Nicholas Nightingale Gruner (born May 4, 1942) was a Roman Catholic priest and is a promoter of the message of Our Lady of Fatima, an apparition of the Virgin Mary at Fatima, Portugal in 1917.
Biography.
The fifth of seven children, Gruner was born in Montreal, Canada, to Malcom and Jessie (née Mullally) Gruner. His paternal grandmother claimed the family was related to Florence Nightingale. He is a graduate of McGill University with post-graduate degrees in theology from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome. Gruner was ordained at Avellino, Italy on August 22, 1976 by Bishop Pasquale Venezia. In 1978, he launched a periodical dedicated to Our Lady of Fatima, which was a journal mostly dedicated to praying the rosary, until Gruner became focused particularly on the consecration of the Soviet Union controversy.
Gruner was ordained in the diocese of Avellino, Italy. In 1996 he was suspended from his priestly functions by the Bishop of Avellino, Italy, and appealed the suspension. The appeal was unsuccessful. In September 2001, the Congregation for the Clergy, stated that Father Gruner's suspension was "confirmed by a definitive sentence of the supreme tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura." 
Gruner and the "Fatima Crusader".
In 1929, Lúcia dos Santos, one of the three children entrusted with alleged revelations from the church-sanctioned Marian apparition at Fatima, Portugal, revealed that the Virgin Mary had requested that Russia should be consecrated to Her Immaculate Heart. If that did not happen, Sister Lúcia explained, communist "errors" would triumph, the Catholic Church would be persecuted, the Papacy would enter a period of tribulation, faithful Catholics would be martyred and whole nations would be destroyed.
In accord with Sister Lúcia's avowal, Pope Pius XII consecrated the entire world (including Russia, but not mentioning it specifically) to the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1942. However, that proved, at least initially, to be insufficient for Sister Lúcia, who indicated that the Pope and all the bishops of the Church should make the Consecration simultaneously. In 1984, Pope John Paul II followed his predecessor in consecrating the entire world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, but without specifically mentioning Russia, and again without the bishops joining in. Father Gruner has dedicated his life not only to publicizing Fatima's message of world peace, but urging his readers to petition the Catholic Church for all bishops to participate in the Consecration of Russia.
Gruner held that John Paul II was held by the consent of his predecessor, Pope John XXIII, to an alleged Vatican/Moscow concordat, which had been signed between His Holiness and then-Premier Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union. This was primarily because the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, also supported this alleged concordat. Throughout the 1980s, the Fatima Crusader made further frequent allegations that the Vatican had been infiltrated and subverted, and that the Soviet Union was engaging in deliberate deception when it depicted Mikhail Gorbachev and perestroika as initiators of internal communist reform after the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. In 1988, he urged a letter writing campaign against arms control talks.
When the Soviet Union finally disintegrated in 1991, Fatima pietist groups, like the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima and Fatima Family Apostolate, rejoiced, regarding this as evidence of the efficacy of the dedication of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary that John Paul II had conducted nine years beforehand, but which Gruner and the "Fatima Crusader" discount based on the lack of evidence of a spiritual conversion in Russia.
Gruner initiated a radio and television campaign for his message, leading his organization's claimed membership to reach an estimated four hundred thousand by the early nineties. Since then, the "Crusader" has continued to argue for the Consecration of Russia and maintained that such action is urgent.
On October 23, 2012 Gruner, along with Catholic attorney and ally Christopher Ferrara, appeared at the headquarters of the European Union in Strasbourg, France to speak in support of a motion for a declaration by the EU Parliament calling upon Pope Benedict XVI to carry out the Consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Gruner and Ferrara were invited to speak by the sponsors of the motion, MEPs Mario Borghezio and Lorenzo Fontana.

Hartley Mauditt

Hartley Mauditt is a hamlet in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England. It is south of the village of East Worldham, and 2.6 miles (4.1km) southeast of Alton, just east of the B3006 road and south of West Worldham. The nearest railway station is northwest of the village, at Alton.
Geography.
Hartley Mauditt is still an agricultural parish of some with several large farms but the population numbers are low, although the medieval village was much larger but has now shrunk down to the parish church of St. Leonard and a handful of cottages. The few remaining houses include an attractive 17th century thatched cottage, an elegant old rectory, and the converted village school on the parish boundary adjoining West Worldham.
History.
Hartley Mauditt was first documented in the Domesday Book as "Herlege" (meaning hartland or woodland); "Hartley" signifies a pasture for deer. The manor had been granted to William de Maldoit (by corruption rendered Mauditt) by William the Conqueror. Later, it was in the possession of John of Gaunt, the Duchy of Lancaster, the Crown, and then the Stuarts.
In 1790 the Stuarts sold the manor to Henry Bilson-Legge whose son pulled down the manor house in 1798. After the demolition of the house the hamlet of Hartley Mauditt declined, and eventually left the church as the only remaining building in the site of the hamlet, although there are houses elsewhere in the parish.

Fort Amiel Museum

Fort Amiel Museum is in Newcastle KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
Fort Amiel was constructed in 1876 by Major Charles Frederick Amiel and soldiers of the 80th Staffordshire Volunteers. It was built as a fort and "look-out post", for the British during the run up to the annexation of the former Transvaal and the Zulu War, although it really never served that purpose.
During the First Boer War it was used as a garrison for the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster).
Fort Amiel served as a commissariat depot, transit camp and hospital. Many wounded soldiers were taken there, to recover from their wounds. The fort is positioned on a knoll overlooking the original wagon drift across the Ncandu River. It has majestic views of the Drakensberg mountain range and the town of Newcastle.
Major Charles Frederick Amiel was born on 2 August 1822, in Hanover Square, London, England. He was christened on 2 August 1822 in St Peter, Chertsey, Surrey, England. Major Amiel died on 10 September 1885 at London, England. He was buried at St Peter, Westminster, London. Amiel never married.
The fort and surroundings, including a graveyard below the knoll fell into disuse for many years. In 1979 the site was declared a National Monument and restoration work began after the discovery of the original plans for the fort were discovered during this period in a London Museum. The restoration work was undertaken by the visionary Newcastle Town Council and in conjunction with the Natal Museum Services.
Today, Fort Amiel houses an historic/cultural museum. Military displays of the two Anglo-Boer Wars. There is a wonderful cookhouse re-construction, this shows a typical British Army Base found in the 1880s.
An addition to the fort and museum is a Zulu umuzi (hut) with a detailed interior.

<doc id="19712504" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19712504" title="High-altitude platform">
High-altitude platform

A high-altitude platform (HAP) is a quasi-stationary aircraft that provides means of delivering a service to a large area while staying thousands of feet above in the air for long periods of time. A HAP differs from other aircraft in the sense that it is specially designed to operate at a very high altitude (17–22 km) and is able to stay there for hours, even days. The new generation of HAPs, however, will expand this period to several years.
Limitation due to power.
A HAP can be a manned or unmanned aeroplane, balloon, or an airship. All require electrical power to keep themselves and their payload functional. While current HAPs are powered by batteries or engines, mission time is limited by the need for recharging/refueling. Therefore, alternative means are being considered for the future. Solar energy is one of best options currently being used for under trial HAPs (Helios, Lindstrand HALE).
Laser propulsion (Lightcraft) might be useful as an additional ground based power source.
Altitude selection for HAPs.
Whether an airship or an aeroplane, a major challenge is the ability of the HAP to maintain stationkeeping in the face of winds. An operating altitude of between 17 and 22 km is chosen because in most regions of the world this represents a layer of relatively mild wind and turbulence. Although the wind profile may vary considerably with latitude and with season, a form similar to that shown will usually obtain. This altitude (> 17 km) is also above commercial air-traffic heights, which would otherwise prove a potentially prohibitive constraint.
Comparison to satellites.
Since HAPs operate at much lower altitudes than satellites, it is possible to cover a small region much more effectively. Lower altitude also means much lower link budget (hence lower power consumption) and smaller round trip delay compared to satellites. Furthermore, deploying a satellite drains significant time and monetary resources, in terms of development and launch. HAPs, on the other hand, do not cost much and are rapidly deployable. Another major difference is that a satellite, once launched, does not allow for full maintenance, while HAPs do.
Applications.
One of latest uses of HAPs has been for wireless communications. Research on HAPs is being actively carried largely in Europe, where scientists are considering them as a platform to deliver high speed connectivity to users, over areas of up to 400 km. It has gained significant interest because HAPs will be able to deliver bandwidth and capacity similar to a broadband wireless access network (such as WiMAX) while providing a coverage area similar to that of a satellite. 
One of the best examples of a high-altitude platform used for surveillance and security is RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV used by the US Air Force. It has a service ceiling of 20 km and can stay in the air for continuous 36 hours. It carries a highly sophisticated sensor system including radar, optical, and infrared imagers. It is powered by a turbofan engine and is able to deliver digital sensor data in realtime to a ground station.
Another future use which is currently being investigated is monitoring of a particular area or region for activities such as flood detection, seismic monitoring, remote sensing and disaster management.
Perhaps the most common use of high-altitude platforms is for environment/weather monitoring. Numerous experiments are conducted through high-altitude balloons mounted with scientific equipment, which is used to measure environmental changes or to keep track of weather. Recently, NASA in partnership with The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has started using Global Hawk UAV to study Earth's Atmosphere.
Due to the height more than 90% of atmospheric matter is below the HAP. This reduces atmospheric drag for starting rockets.
"As a rough estimate, a rocket that reaches an altitude of 20 km when launched from the ground will reach 100 km if launched at an altitude of 20 km from a balloon."
It also allows the usage of (long) mass drivers for launching goods or humans into orbits.

After brief spells with Cheltenham Town and Exeter City (on a non-contract basis), he then moved to Stockport County and Doncaster Rovers, for whom he played seven and nine matches respectively. He then played six games for Preston North End alongside future Everton manager David Moyes. He had brief spells at Bromsgrove Rovers and Limerick, with whom he was player-coach between September and November 1994.
He then moved to Hong Kong, where he played for the Sing Tao Sports Club, as well as for a Hong Kong league All-Star team and although he never represented the official Hong Kong national side, he did take on the likes of Sampdoria, Inter Milan and the Yugoslavian national side in unofficial matches. He finished off his career by playing professional football in Singapore with clubs such as Jurong, Balestier Khalsa and Tanjong Pagar United.
Post-retirement career.

Pontiac Firebird (third generation)

The third generation Pontiac Firebird was introduced in late 1981 alongside its twin, the Chevrolet Camaro for the 1982 model year. These were also the first Firebirds with factory fuel injection, four-speed automatic transmissions, five-speed manual transmissions, four-cylinder engines, 16-inch wheels, and hatchback bodies.
1982.
The 3rd Generation of Firebirds took flight with three models: Firebird, Firebird S/E, and Firebird Trans Am. The Firebird was the base model, equivalent to the Camaro Sport Coupe; the Firebird S/E was the luxury version; and the Trans Am, the high-performance version. For 1982, the new Firebird and Camaro had been completely restyled, with the windshield slope set at a dramatic, wind cheating 62 degrees, (about 3 degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), flush mounted side glass, and for the first time, a large, glass-dominated rear hatchback. Electronically controlled retractable headlamps, and a rounded hoodline and front fenders were the primary characteristics that distinguished the Firebird from its Camaro sibling and its previous Firebird incarnations. The Firebird would retain hidden headlamps until the end of all production in 2002. Pontiac had also hoped to drop the "Trans Am" moniker from the redesigned cars to save royalties paid to the SCCA for use of the name. Early promotional cars were marked "T/A" as an alternative, however it was decided that doing so might cause more problems than it was worth and the "Trans Am" nameplate remained. Still, with its dimensions reduced, wheelbase shortened, and weight reduced, the Third Generation Firebird was also the closest yet in size to the original 1967 model. It won "Best Sports GT" category in the $11,000 to $14,000 range (also along with the Camaro). Road & Track called the fuel-injected Trans Am "a dramatic improvement on its predecessors," accelerating from 0–60 in 9.2 seconds.
The new Firebird shrank to a 101-inch wheelbase, losing more than 8 inches in overall length, measured about an inch narrower, and weighed nearly less than its 1981 predecessor. It also was the most aerodynamic production Firebird to date with a drag coefficient of 0.33. The new Trans Am took things a bit further, with a coefficient of .32. The Trans Am body would continue to improve aerodynamically over the years, and by 1985 would be the most aerodynamic vehicle to ever be released from General Motors with a 0.29 coefficient of drag. Wind tunnels were used to form the 3rd Gen F-Body's shape, and these aerodynamic developments were fully taken advantage of by Pontiac's design team. The sleek new car had a low slung front end which featured split grilles. They fed some air to the radiator but most of the air came from an air dam underneath the front bumper. Every piece of the car was designed to reduce drag. The newly designed side view mirror housings, made of light alloy metal, were almost cone shaped, with the point facing the wind. The windshield wipers were hidden under the hood with the air intake for the climate control system. It made for a smooth flow of air over the windshield. The retractable headlamps popped up from the leading edge of the hood. The cars tended to outlive the plastic gears for the headlight doors, and since the dealers charged several hundred dollars for the repair, it was common to see Firebirds driving around with one or both headlights stuck open during the day. Smooth wheelcovers were available on the Trans Am, attached to turbine finned alloy wheels. A frameless, flush mounted, compound curved rear glass hatchback decklid provided . of cargo space with the rear seats folded, and an optional wiper. It provided no disturbance to the airflow over the back of the car. All of these features combined together to provide a low coefficient of drag.
Up front, power disc brakes were now made standard on all Firebird models. Taking styling cues from the 1981 design, the new car had full width tail lights, complete with a bird emblem in the center. The all-new suspension design was more advanced and aggressive than anything Detroit had offered previously, easily rivaling the Corvette's handling abilities, (but not its sophistication). The front suspension utilized MacPherson struts, with inboard mounted coil springs and lower front control arms. Out back, rear coil springs and shocks were positioned between the body and solid rear axle, with twin rear lower control arms/trailing links and a torsion bar, replacing the old-fashioned leaf springs design used previously in the 2nd Gens. A huge torque arm was mounted from the transmissions tailshaft to the rear axle center to further stabilize the axle's tendency to twist.
The interior now featured aircraft inspired details and gauges, using both fake and real Torx head screws that fastened the dash and console trim panels. The large round gauges, black with white numerals, were very legible. The main controls were all within easy reach of the steering wheel, and with the optional Recaro seats, you could drive several hundred miles at a time without fatigue. The 1981 non-Formula 3 spoke steering wheel was re-used and featured a clear Firebird logo mounted in the center of the horn pad, with optional leather grip. Many power options could be had. Special Viscount "PMD" bucket seats were optional, featuring a small opening in the headrest and a PMD logo in the center of the backrest. Leather seats were also available on both the standard seats and Viscount "PMD" seats. A standard locking rear glovebox was mounted on the rear driver"s side of the cargo area, a mini spare tire was hidden behind the opposite panel on the passenger side. A lockable cargo door on the rear floor area and a retractable cargo area privacy shade were also available as options on all Firebirds.
The Firebird lineup was available with several engines: 
The Firebird came standard with 14-inch steel wheels, with several wheel options available unique to the base model. 14-inch turbo cast aluminum wheels were standard on the S/E and Trans Am models and featured smooth plastic hubcaps with a Pontiac "Arrowhead" in the center. The WS6 performance package option, available on the S/E and Trans Am, included 4-wheel disc brakes, P215/65R15 Goodyear Eagle GT radials with 15-inch cast aluminum wheels, stiffer springs, thicker 32 mm front & 21 mm rear sway bars, a 12.7:1 quick-ratio steering box, and limited slip rear differential. Also available was the WS7 option, which was the same as RPO WS6, but utilized rear drum brake. This option was created due to a shortage of rear disc brake components.
The Firebird S/E was Pontiac's attempt to lure buyers interested in more luxurious accommodations. It could be had with the basic fuel saving "Iron Duke" I-4 drivetrain, but was loaded up with almost every option as a Trans Am. Even the Trans Am's WS6 suspension was available on the S/E. It was delineated from the base Firebird model by "S/E" script on the sail panels, in place of the standard Firebird decals, and the Trans Am's dark tinted tail lights. The interior featured color-coded plastics to match the exterior/interior paint scheme. On S/E models equipped with the 14-inch or 15-inch "Turbocast" rims, with "Bowling Ball" hubcaps were color-coded to match the car's exterior paint.
The Trans Am came standard with a new incarnation of its traditional "Air Extractors" on the fenders. A dark-tinted version of the base Firebird's tail lights were fitted to the rear of the car and also featured a Silver or Gold "Screaming Chicken" between them. Rubber "Mini-Spats", aka stone deflectors, were mounted just before the front and rear wheels, and were much toned down from the macho 70's design used on the earlier 2nd Gen Trans Am. Styled loosely after the earlier '80/'81 Turbo Trans Am, an optional "Turbo Bulge" hood was available on the Trans Am. In fact, plans had originally been made to use a refined version of Pontiac's Turbo 4.9L engine. It was scrapped at the last minute, leaving many to speculate as to what could have been, had the engine been allowed to survive like its Turbo kin, the Buick Turbo 3.8L V6. Despite this, the Turbo Bulge hood remained on the option list. On the Crossfire V-8, it was made functional, and even a lightweight aluminum version of this hood, "RPO T45", was available on the option list. It was a beautifully curved piece of pressed steel, and would be used in later years as the centerpiece of the Formula option. A new, smaller "Screaming Chicken" was placed upon the Turbo Bulge hood or upon the nose of flat hood equipped T/A's. The Trans Am came standard with one of the two 305 Chevy V8's. The well worn Borg-Warner four-speed manual transmission came mated only to the weak 145 bhp LG4 305ci, while the Crossfire-injected LU5 305ci rated at 165 hp came with the TH-200c automatic 3-speed transmission. 
The new version of the Trans Am Pontiac's infamous "RPO Y84" Black and Gold Trans Am S/E, made famous by Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason in 1977's "Smokey and the Bandit", carried on into 1982 as the limited edition "Recaro T/A". The package added about 25% to the price of a Trans Am. Standard with a host of options, some features included charcoal Parella cloth Recaro seats, t-tops, a black exterior with gold trim, and black "Bowling Ball" hubcaps with special Gold Pontiac Arrowhead emblems on its center, mounted on gold-painted 15-inch aluminum wheels.
Another Special Trans Am also returned, the Daytona 500 Pace Car Edition. These cars do exist, albeit quite rare, and much is still unknown about how many were built or how they were optioned. All were Bright Red, with all of the prerequisite special NASCAR decals, similar to both the 1981 Daytona Pace Car and the 1983 Daytona Pace Car... 15" Aero Rims adorned with Black Bowling Ball hubcaps and a WS6 suspension. All had a Black Interior, but it is not currently known if they included Black Recaro seats. Seeing as it was Pontiac's debut of the still-fresh 3rd Generation 1982 Trans Am, it can reasonably be thought that they would have been optioned with many of Pontiac's best amenities, however few are known to still exist at this time so it is hard to discern what options they actual came with. These cars are also observable in the 1982 Daytona 500 race footage and in various advertisements.
A modified black 1982 Firebird Trans Am appeared in the new for 1982 television series "Knight Rider" as KITT, voiced by William Daniels. For the reunion movie "Knight Rider 2000", KITT underwent a makeover and became the "Knight Industries 4000," a vehicle resembling the Pontiac Banshee concept car.
1983.
The Firebird remained basically unchanged from the previous model year. All automatic transmission Firebirds now received a T-handle shifter knob, and the shift indicator changed for the Automatic Overdrive 700-R4. Midyear, the L69 high output 305 was introduced. This carbureted 190 hp V8 was virtually identical to the L69 engine in the Camaro Z28, but used a different air cleaner assembly (instead of the Camaro's dual-snorkel air cleaner, the Trans Am received yet another functional cold air intake, designed to utilize the bulged hood).
The S/E Firebirds remained primarily the same outside of some color changes from the 1982 model year.
The RPO "Y84" Recaro Edition Trans Am or "Recaro T/A", was revised for 1983. It was now built to the owner's tastes, including many more, or less options, and RPO "Y81" returned as the Recaro Edition Trans Am S/E without T-Tops. The LG4 was standard as was the WS6 package. The exterior remained virtually the same, except now the Firebird logo decals on the sail panels were replaced with Gold-plated Black and Gold Firebird Logo Medallions. The interior now featured Tan leather Recaro seats, carpeting, side panels, and the headliner.
In its second year, the third generation Trans Am was again selected as the Daytona 500 Pace Car, and Pontiac offered a total of 2,500 Daytona Pace Car replicas through their dealerships. 
The exterior was painted with a two-tone white/charcoal paint scheme, "Official Pace Car" decals on the doors, "NASCAR" decals on the rear quarter panels, and "PONTIAC" decals on the front windshield and rear glass. 
Decorating the front fenders just above the "TRANS AM" script were "25th ANNIVERSARY DAYTONA 500" emblems. 
A new graphic adorned the power bulge of the pace car's hood, and these limited-edition cars were the first to feature a special RPO W62, full-body ground-effects package that extended around the entire car and molded plastic panels.
"TRANS AM" script appeared on the right-hand panel, in place of the standard Firebird nose grilles. 
Two different set of wheels were offered: 1) 15-inch "AERO" wheels with White "Bowling Ball" hub caps, or 2) silver-finned wheels.
The interior featured red gauge lighting, leather clad steering wheel, shifter knob, and brake handle, a special dash plaque, "Daytona 500" floor-mats, and two-tone grey leather/suede Recaro seats.
1,980 of these pace cars came with the LU5 Crossfire-injected 305 mated to the new 700R4 4-speed overdrive automatic; 520 had the carbureted LG4 305, mated to the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed manual.
1984.
Total production for Firebird models increased to 128,304 units, making this the best-selling year of the 3rd Generation Firebird.
The Firebird's interior options and design remained virtually unchanged for 1984, the only exceptions being a slightly revised dashpad, with screwed-in speaker grilles, an optional driver's knee pad bolster on the left side of the center console for manual cars, the T-tops were also redesigned to use a pin-mounting arrangement, rather than the earlier latch-based setup, and a new 1 piece horncap embossed with the Firebird logo replaced the earlier medallion version. Base model Firebird production increased to 62,621 units.
The S/E Firebirds also remained virtually unchanged as well, with 10,309 units built.
The Trans Am's basic layout was very similar to the earlier 1983 Trans Am, except they were now available with the optional RPO W62 ground effects package, previously used on the 1983 Daytona Pace Car Edition. Another new for 1984 option was the "High-Tech" 15-inch, 20-slot, concave aluminum wheels, painted Gold or Silver, with Black plastic centercaps containing a Gold or Silver Firebird logo. The only drivetrain changes made for the 1984 model year were the deletion of the Trans Am only EFI Crossfire 305, a hydraulic clutch was now used on the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed transmission, and on L69 equipped cars, a lightweight flywheel and an aluminum belhousing were employed. L69 equipped Trans Ams also received a 8000 RPM tachometer, an 80 PSI oil pressure gauge, a high output single electric fan, a functional cold-air induction hood, a higher output mechanical fuel pump, and a secondary electric fuel pump to help prevent vapor lock. Trans Am production increased to 55,374 units.
The RPO "Y84" & "Y81" Recaro Edition Trans Am S/E's were slightly revised. The H.O 305 L69 engine was now the only available engine. The exterior still featured a Black painted body, but gone was the Gold paint on the lower half of the body. All now featured Black painted, RPO W62 Aero package ground effects, the special "RECARO T/A" door handle inserts, the 1983 style Gold-plated Black and Gold Firebird Medallions on the sail panels, Gold painted High Tech 15-inch rims with a Black plastic center cap and Gold Firebird logo, WS6 package, functional cold air induction "Turbo Hood", with a Gold "fade" decal and Gold "5.0 Liter H.O." script on the turbo hood's bulge, Gold "TRANS AM" decals on the fenders and right side of the rear bumper, a special 3-row Gold pinstripe that wrapped around 98% of the lower area of the car, extending up, around the wheelwells, (similar to the 2nd Generaration Y84 S/E Trans Am's pinstripes). The interior still featured its namesake Tan leather Recaro seats. Sadly, this was to be the swan song year for Pontiac's storied Black and Gold RPO "Y84" Trans Am S/E's... a mere 1321 Recaro T/A's were produced.
For the 15th Anniversary of the Trans Am, Pontiac released a stunning, White and Blue Trans Am, following in the original 1969 Trams Am's striking color scheme for $3499 over the base $10,699, and limited to just 1500 units. It also only utilized the H.O. 305 L69, with 1000 automatics and only 500 with the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed. The exterior featured a White painted body, T-tops, White painted RPO W62 ground effects, special Blue "TRANS AM" decals on the lower rear half of the doors, Blue pinstripes similar to the Recaro T/A except they extend around the entire body, special Blue and White 15th ANNIVERSARY medallions on the sail panels, a functional cold air induction "Turbo Hood", with a Blue "fade" decal and Blue "5.0 Liter H.O." script on the turbo hood's bulge. The Black tinted Trans Am tail lights featured White paint on the horizontal bars, and a stunning Blue on White Firebird logo on the tail light center panel. Another special item featured only on the 15th Anniversary cars was the all new "Aero-Tech" 16-inch convex aluminum wheels, (front/rear specific). They wheels were painted White, with Blue pinstripes around the clear coated polished lip's outer perimeter, and were shod with Goodyear P245/50/VR16 "Gatorback" uni-directional tires (the new wheel/tire combo was very similar to the Corvette's P255/50/VR16 arrangement), marking the first appearance of 16 by 8-inch wheels on any F-body and a first for Pontiac. The WS6 package was standard with a 15th Anniversary Only 25 mm rear sway bar, (as opposed to the ordinary WS6's 23 mm bar). Interior features included: Off-White leather with grey cloth inserts Recaro seats with repeating "TRANS AM' script on the center portions, a special Off-White Leather-wrapped steering wheel with a special Blue and White 15th medallion inset in an Off-White Horn Button, Off-White leather shifter knob and parking brake handle, and Off-White pass-side map pocket w/ a Blue Firebird logo and Blue "TRANS AM" script.
1985.
All Firebird models underwent redevelopment to boost sales as a number of power train improvements were introduced. The Firebird received a restyled nose with Black wrap-around inserts known as "bumperettes" to replace the grille inserts; wrap-around "bumperettes" were also added to the rear bumper. The tail lights remained unchanged from the previous "louvered" style design. The carbureted V6 was replaced with a new, multi-port fuel-injected 2.8L V6 making 135 hp. The interior evolved with a new dash design containing redesigned gauges that used a graph-patterned background, a slightly refined dashpad, new T-handle shifter for automatics; a padded and more ergonomic center console design, updated stereo and HVAC faceplates, and an optional version of the previous year's more ergonomic 15th Anniversary's steering wheel.
The Firebird S/E underwent some changes as well. It too used the new for '85 nose and rear bumper, but it now included some new items to set it apart. It received a new special hood, similar to the new Trans Am hood except with only the front vents, the new Trans Am tail light design, color-coded Firebird logo medallions on the sail panels, (similar to the '83/'84 Recaro version), and a color-coded rear Firebird logo on the center section of the tail lights. Cloth Recaro seats were also now available.
The Recaro T/A was no longer available, but cloth Recaro seats were optional on the Trans Am.
The Trans Am also underwent changes. The LG4 & L69 continued on, but a new fuel-injected 305ci was now available in the Trans Am. The LB9 Tuned Port Injection (TPI) 305 was released, using a tuned runner design. The LB9 produced 210 hp, which brought it suitable attention from buyers despite being unavailable with a manual transmission. The "Turbo Bulge" hood was discontinued in favor of a new flat hood with twin louvered vents or "nostrils" that were functional, with heat exhaust vents on the rear edges. The Trans Am also received a restyled nose, integral fog lights, and newly redesigned ground effects. It utilized new "low density" taillight lenses with a grid-style pattern rather than the "louvered" pattern in use since 1982. The Trans Am came standard with the "High Tech" 15-inch concave aluminum wheels from the previous year, but it was also now available with the a version of the 15th Anniversary's WS6 suspension and its "Aero Tech" 16-inch aluminum wheels, but in finished Natural Silver. A Borg-Warner 9-bolt differential was made available for the first time, and was said to be stronger than the standard corporate 10 bolt axle. Further attempts to put the Trans Am into higher regard included overhead console from the Camaro lineup, which included several manually adjusted reminder wheels, a positionable map light, a removable flashlight with "FIREBIRD" script, and a small pocket for a garage door opener or sunglasses. The standard rear spoiler from previous years was still standard, but an optional wrap-around "Aero Spoiler" was now available in black and gave the car a new more modern look, (it is unique for 1985 & 1986 as it had a texture). The Trans Am drag coefficient was measured at 0.32 but was as low as 0.29 with the standard Aero wheels instead of the High-Tech turbo aluminum wheels. At the time, it was the most aerodynamically efficient car GM ever produced.
1986.
All Firebirds received center, high-mounted stop lamps to comply with Federal legislation; these were placed on top of the back hatch window. New tail light lenses were now introduced on the base Firebird, completing the replacement of the "slit" or "louvered" taillight lenses that had been a Firebird signature since 1967. The 2.5L 4-cylinder engine was dropped, replaced by the multi-port fuel-injected 2.8L V6 as the standard engine. The Firebird S/E model was discontinued at the end of the year. The rubber–vinyl wrap-around rear wing became standard on Trans Am (available only in black; as these wings aged, these and those offered on subsequent model-year vehicles would suffer from cracking and splitting problems), the Wing spoiler was a credit option on the Trans Am, and mandatory if the louvered rear window was ordered. Midyear, Pontiac introduced a new light-weight, cross-lace wheel, available for the Trans Am.
Only 26 Trans Ams with the 305 H.O L69 were built in 1986; it was discontinued because of fuel vapor lock (boiling) problems. Some sources indicate the 305 TPI engine output was decreased from 210 hp to 190 hp, while others maintain it stayed at 210 hp. Paint RPO's were changed to reflect the new base-coat/clear-coat paint process. American Sunroof (ASC), licensed by Chevrolet to build the 1987 Camaro convertible, also built three 1986 Trans Am convertibles as a "design exercise".
In spite of rumors abound there were NO L98 (350ci TPI) cars made in 1986 according to Pontiac. 11
1987.
The Firebird body remained basically unchanged. All center, high-mounted stop lamps were relocated to a new position between the spoiler and the rear deck lid, and the large Firebird hood emblem disappeared forever. All V8's now received factory roller camshafts, and faced with consumer demands for more power, GM officially released the new 5.7L with tuned port fuel injection. Available only with an automatic transmission, it produced 210 hp and takes the top performance seat from the 5.0L TPI. L69 production is stopped, leaving the LG4 as the only remaining carbureted V8 used in the F-body. Trans Am GTA (Gran Turismo Americano) was introduced, available with the LB9 305 TPI engine (which was returned to 215 hp) or the L98 350 TPI. Gold 16-inch, flat-mesh, diamond-spoke wheels were standard on GTA, with 16-inch, 20-slot wheels standard on Trans Am.
Firebird Formula was re-introduced, available with a choice of V8's (LG4, LB9 305 TPI, or L98 350 TPI), 16-inch convex wheels, and the earlier Trans Am "Turbo Bulge" hood. The wrap-around wing was updated and now standard on Trans Am and Formula; the regular, flat-surfaced spoiler from earlier Trans Am models was now made standard on Firebird. Trans Am and Formula were also offered with an optional 140 mph speedometer.
WS6 was standard equipment on the Formula and GTA from 1987 to 1992, and optional on the Trans Am. WS6 from 1987 thru 1992 included 36 mm front sway bars, 24 mm rear sway bars, quick ratio steering box, gas filled struts and 16" Wheels with 235/50R16 Tires. Later WS6 cars used ZR rated tires.
The Trans Am GTA was Pontiac's pride and joy with a standard 5.7L 350 Tuned Port Injection (TPI). Many people like to say, incorrectly, that the engine itself was pulled directly out of the C4 Corvette, which itself began using the engine in 1985, but the heads on the Corvette were aluminum whereas the Firebird heads were cast Iron, although it did give the GTA performance numbers comparable to GM's flagship performance platform from whence it came. The GTA came with a standard TH-700R4 (4L60) automatic transmission, A/C, new seats with inflatable lumbar and side bolsters, special door panels, epoxy-filled emblems, body-colored ground effects, a special GTA horn button, and the legendary WS6 performance handling package. All of these options were packaged into the Trans Am under the RPO code Y84, and the model was produced until the end of Third Generation F-body production in 1992.
Dealerships could finally order a Firebird Convertible from a recognized coach builder that was already converting other GM products (though more than a dozen other companies had been converting F-bodies into convertibles since 1982 for Pontiac & Chevrolet dealers). ASC (American Sunroof Company, Later "American Specialty Cars") (of ASC McLaren fame) offered Pontiac Dealerships a Firebird/Formula/Trans Am/GTA convertible. ASC was contracted to convert all of the official Camaro Convertibles from 1987 to 1992. However due to fuel economy restrictions mandated by the EPA, a convertible Firebird would have been assessed a $1200 Gas Guzzler Tax because the LB9 & L98 when paired with a Trans Am or GTA would have been lower than 22.5 average MPG. For this reason Pontiac did not directly offer a convertible through dealers like the Camaro. However these were not an official Pontiac offering, they are considered coach convertibles. The conversion of the Firebird was identical to the "Factory" Camaros of the same model year. The exception was the obvious cosmetic changes, the rear quarter caps, spoiler (Which was a Base spoiler Wing cut off) and the high mount 3rd brake light were Firebird convertible specific.
To order a Firebird Convertible the dealership would order a T-top Firebird and have it Drop shipped to ASC, One Sunroof Center, Southgate, MI 48195 for the conversion alongside "Factory" Camaros. Once complete, ASC would ship the now Firebird convertible to the participating dealership for delivery. This remained the procedure for dealerships through the 1989 model year. According to ASC they did not convert any Firebirds for the 1990 model year. As popularity increased and car became lighter & more aerodynamic for the 1991 model year the process was simplified as Pontiac offered a convertible through normal dealer ordering channels via RPO's. A Total of 173 Firebird Convertibles were reported by ASC for 1987.
1988.
The Firebird remained basically unchanged. The 170 hp LG4 carbureted 5.0L V8 was dropped in favor of the new 170 hp L03 5.0L V8 with throttle body injection. All V8 engines received serpentine belt systems and the A/C compressors were moved to the passenger's side of the engine, de-cluttering the engine compartment. The Firebird Formula received new high tech 16x8-inch aluminum wheels with distinctive silver "WS6" center caps. The GTA wheels were slightly restyled, and the convex 16-inch wheels were dropped as all Trans Ams received the 16x8" diamond-spoke aluminum wheels, available in different colors (white, red, charcoal, and black) in addition to the GTA's gold. The GTA received a new steering wheel with integral radio controls. The Trans Am was made available with body-colored ground effects like those on the GTA.
The optional convertible model also carried over, and now optional on the GTA was a new "notchback" hatch: rather than the large, glass hatchback that had been common to the Third Generation Firebird, the optional notchback consisted of a fiberglass trunk lid with a small, flat, vertical glass window. The notchback also incorporated redesigned rear seatbacks with integral headrests. The notchback became popular with onlookers, who often assumed the notchback-equipped GTA was a Ferrari, thereby encouraging some owners of the type to dub their GTA the "Ferrari Back." Many Trans Am owners were unaware that the $800 notchback option was even available, and for those who were, the vehicle typically had to be ordered from the factory, on a six-month waiting list, as the notchback was retrofitted to the vehicle. In rare instances, a dealership would get a notchback-equipped GTA on their lot. Another reason for the relative obscurity of the notchback is that the sales information was not very well disseminated to Pontiac salespeople, so many of them had no idea it was available as an option. As attractive as the notchback was, GTA owners were constantly plagued with structural and cosmetic issues with the design. The fiberglass would blister, causing surface bubbles resembling a bad case of acne. The Pontiac repair solutions were simply to sand the notchback down and repaint it, but the problem would always return, and GTA owners could expect multiple trips in order to achieve a final repair of the problem, or to have a new notchback installed. The notchback was intended to carry over and be standard-issue on the 1989 20th Anniversary GTA, but the plan never materialized; the aforementioned quality control issues apparently caused GM not to carry it over to the next year..
ASC continued to offer a Convertible for dealerships in 1988. A total of 104 Firebird Convertibles are reported from ASC for Pontiac Dealerships.

1989.
1989 was the biggest year for Pontiac with respect to press coverage, promotions, and performance. It was not well known at the time, but in 1989, Pontiac produced the quickest and fastest American production car. The "Excitement Division" was also asked to provide a car to pace the 73rd running of the Indianapolis 500; sadly, it would be the final time a Pontiac would ever receive that honor. The Trans Am model was now 20 years old, and it was time for another anniversary edition, with this special 20th Anniversary Trans Am to be based on the existing Trans Am GTA. Through a unique partnership between Pontiac and an engineering firm called Prototype Automotive Services (PAS), the Trans Am GTA was equipped with a more powerful version of the turbocharged Buick 3.8L V6, originally developed for the Buick Regal Grand National, and the Turbo Trans Am (TTA) became the vehicle Pontiac supplied to pace the Indianapolis 500. Ultimately, 1,555 TTA replicas, rated at 250 hp, were produced for sale, five of those being test cars. But after "Car and Driver" magazine tested the car, logging a 0–60 mph run in 4.6 seconds, and a standing quarter-mile in 13.4 seconds at 101 mph, they called the 250 hp rating "exceedingly modest," estimating the actual output to be "closer to 300 hp." They also subsequently reported that it was the "quickest 0–60 sprinter available in any US production-car showroom – at any price." The "Car and Driver" evaluation produced the best acceleration performance of any main stream publication to test a regular TTA press car from the Pontiac fleet, partly because "Car and Driver" realized that the turbo boost must be "preloaded" to get maximum performance figures. But short-distance sprinting was not all this car could do well. Early in 1989, "Motor Trend" ran their top speed test article "Flat-out Fastest American Cars II-the Sequel." During this test, the TTA did 162 mph, and was the fastest production car evaluated in the test. However, "Motor Trend" declared the winner to be a 1989 Corvette ZR-1, which went much faster, but was not a production car (it was a prototype that Chevrolet intended to release for production in 1989, but did not come out until 1990). So by a slight technicality, the TTA could be called the flat-out quickest (0–60 4.6 sec.) and fastest (162 mph) American production car in 1989. It is interesting to note that the only constraint on the top speed of 162 mph was that the TTA was being limited by the engine redline and automatic transmission (with which all TTA's were equipped). When PAS installed a ZF 6-speed manual transmission into one of the cars, they were able to reach 181 mph. Perhaps more importantly than the performance tests provided by the industry magazines was the fact that these cars were capable of much faster acceleration times – with minimal modifications. In fact, with $300 in new parts installed, 12.5-second quarter-mile runs were achievable – without manually shifting gears or the need to trailer the vehicle to the track! Because of this, the TTA has gained a cult following among amateur racing enthusiasts.
Pontiac sub-contracted the job of engineering the TTA engine modifications to PAS. The narrow engine bay of the Trans Am required the use of different cylinder heads, which happened to have better flow characteristics than the old Buick heads. Special stainless steel headers were made specifically for the project as well. The heads, headers, along with more refined tuning of the boost and fuel curves, all added up to a more powerful package than the older Buicks. PAS was also in charge of testing and assembling the engines. Most TTA's came with T-tops and leather interior, but there were also hardtops and cloth-interior cars. And every TTA had an automatic transmission – the TH200-4R, equipped with overdrive and a torque converter clutch. The three actual pace cars were randomly selected from the production run, and sent to Indianapolis to pace the race. Thus, the pace car replicas were closer to the actual pace cars than any replica previously offered; the only difference between the replicas and the three actual pace cars was the addition of strobe lights and safety equipment to the latter. In addition, the TTA was relatively economical to drive; it returned 24 mpg on the highway, while the only cars (besides the Lotus Esprit Turbo SE) that could approach its performance at the time (Ferraris, Lamborghinis, etc.) were far more costly, and providing only around 10 to 12 mpg. As has been proven to be the case in subsequent years, relying on a small engine for cruising, and a turbocharger for power, provides an exciting driving experience while returning impressive fuel mileage.
The rarest 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Ams are the hardtops and convertibles. Only 40 hardtops were made. Only three convertible TTA's were built by ASC, one of which was bought by the president of PAS, with the other two falling into private hands. Only two are generally known to exist, however, as the ASC order log shows records for only two TTA convertibles. The five test TTA's, because they were for pre-production use, were pulled off of the assembly line without regard to color, and therefore were not necessarily white. At least two of these test cars were sold to private individuals, so there are at least two extremely rare, non-white, factory TTA's in existence; in fact, one is known to be red.
As for the rest of the Firebird line, GM made a new dual catalytic converter exhaust system (RPO code N10) available, freeing up 13% more power from some LB9- and L98-equipped Formulas and Trans Ams; so equipped, LB9 engine output was increased to 225 hp while the L98 increased to 235 hp. The N10 option remained available throughout the balance of the Third Generation production run, however the L98 powerplant was only available with an automatic transmission, whereas the LB9/N10 combination could only be coupled to a 5-speed manual (RPO code MM5) and a limited-slip differential (RPO code G80) using a 3.45 performance axle ratio (RPO code GM3). According to a March 1990 (Vol. 35, No. 9) "Car and Driver" article, when the latter set of options were combined into the relatively unassuming (and 300-pounds-lighter) Formula body, which shared the same WS6 suspension with the top-end Trans Am GTA, it created a "sleeper" Firebird that could out-perform the heavier Trans Am GTA (even when equipped with the L98 engine) – at a roughly 30% lower sticker price. "Car and Driver" also reported that (aside from the TTA, offered only in 1989) these "sleeper" Formulas were the fastest Third-Generation Firebirds – capable of accelerating from 0–60 mph in under 7 seconds and boasting a top speed of more than (quite impressive for the day). Although not an exhaustive comparison, these claims would seem to be supported by a simple examination of the weight-to-power ratios of both models: a 225 hp Formula at a curb weight of versus a 235 hp Trans Am GTA at a curb weight of ; the weight-to-power ratio for the Formula is 14.67 lb/hp compared to 15.32 lb/hp for the Trans Am GTA. According to the same "Car and Driver" article, very few of these "sleeper" Formulas hit the streets; only about 50 were built each model year, as almost all LB9-equipped Formulas came with an automatic transmission – which disqualified them from receiving the high-performance N10 and GM3 options.
Firebirds optioned with T-tops received new acrylic plastic tops made by Leximar for GM. The new tops were lighter in weight and tinted darker, but were more dome shaped and aged rapidly. GM replaced many sets with tops made of glass under warranty, but the acrylic tops continued as standard-issue through 1992. All Firebirds optioned with rear disc brakes now received PBR brake calipers and larger brake rotors, which resolved issues encountered with previous-model rear discs and increased stopping power. Introduction of GM's Vehicle Anti Theft System (VATS) or PASS-Key made all Firebirds more theft-resistant. The system was adapted from GM's higher-end Corvette and Cadillac vehicles in response to an escalating trend among car thieves to target the Camaro and Firebird. VATS incorporated a small resistor into the ignition key shaft which was read by a sensor when the key was inserted. VATS-equipped cars also displayed anti-theft system warning decals in the lower rear corners of the side windows. A new CD player was offered, shoulder belts were added in the back seat, and the convertible model carried over.
TTA production figures:
ASC continued to make Convertibles for Pontiac dealerships. A total of 330 Convertibles were reported by ASC. A portion of those were 350 powered Convertibles. NOTE: 1989 was the First year a US Dealership could order T-top and a 350 Engine in a firebird. Since all Convertibles started as a CC1 (T-Top) car and converted by ASC 1989 would also be the only year to get a 350 powered third generation Firebird convertible.

As a side note there are a known 4 L98 Powered Camaros made in 1987, making the total number of L98 Powered Firebird and Camaro Convertibles produced some of the rarest and sought after third Gens made with a total of under 200 produced for both lines all years combined.
1990.
A driver’s side air bag was made standard. The Firebird interior again received a re-design, this time the changes were much less drastic: the lower dash and under-dash panels were altered, and accessory switches were moved to a new panel above the heater and radio controls. The deluxe contoured interior door panels that were standard in GTAs and available in Trans Ams were no longer available. All models would have to make do with the rather crude, flat, carpeted door panels, although if leather seats were ordered, they put genuine perforated leather above the armrest on the basic door panels. In GTAs the cheap door panels looked very out of place next to the exotic looking articulating seats. The console got a new shift indicator. This time, there was actually a needle to indicate what gear you had selected. Previously, you just had to line up the shifter handle with the markings. Steering wheel mounted radio controls disappeared from the GTA (due to the addition of the airbag), and the L98 engine was no longer offered in the T-top cars due to fuel economy regulations. The LB9 and L98 platforms were updated with new speed density fuel injection, and the elimination of the MAF sensor reduced production costs and supposedly improved performance. All L98-equipped cars now received the N10 dual catalytic converters as standard, which technically was a mid year change for 1989.
Like the Camaro, the 1990 Firebird only received a half-year production run, as Pontiac labored to release the re-styled 1991 model. Production ceased on December 31, 1989.
ASC reported making no Firebird Convertibles for 1990.
1991.
All Firebirds received re-styled noses loosely fashioned after the "Banshee IV" show car while Pontiac was developing the all-new Fourth Generation platform. The Trans Am's ground effects were re-styled as well, and were made available on the base model Firebird, but NA on the Formula. The Trans Am and Firebird Formula received a new fiberglass-constructed, flat, wrap-around wing, The Trans Am and GTA received updated two-piece tail lights with "PONTIAC" scripted in orange across the panels, and the center, high-mounted stop lamps were moved to inside the top edge of the rear hatch.
The FORMULA was the only third Gen F-body to get to T-tops with a 350 Engine starting in MID year 1991 & 1992, to get a FORMULA 350 T-top car the black cross laced wheels (as installed on the Trans AM) were mandatory.
Due to its lighter weight and improved aerodynamics the Firebird Convertible was finally available through GM's normal ordering procedures. ASC still converted T-top cars into convertibles but the ordering process was simplified and dealers would no longer need to have the cars drop shipped to ASC in Michigan. The Convertibles were offered with one of three engine options: LHO 3.1L V6, the L03 5.0L V8 for the base Firebird, or the LB9 5.0L V8 Trans Am only.
An improvement on the T-top cars was introduced mid year on all F-bodies. T-top cars now came with new seals which greatly reduced leaks into the passenger compartment.
Beginning in 1991, SLP (Street Legal Performance) modified a factory-built Formula into what they called the "Firehawk". Once a Formula had been ordered or purchased, this limited-availability option (RPO code B4U) could be specified, and the vehicle was sent to SLP to be modified. No two cars SLP produced were alike; they all were special orders. SLP had anticipated making 250 of these special Firebird Formulas, but in fact, only 27 were ordered; and of those, only 25 were ever built (numbered 1–25 for hardtops – with numbers 18 and 23 never being built – and the only Firehawk Convertible was numbered 27 which was the only non-formula). Of those 25 Firehawks, 21 were "Mandatory" Red, 1 Aqua, 1 White, 1 Blue, and 1 Green; 11 had the Competition Package, 3 came with Aluminum Engine Blocks, 1 had T-Tops, and 1 was a Convertible.

1992.
This marked the final production year for the Third Generation platform. Release of the Fourth Generation model was imminent, and Pontiac made few changes to the 1992 Firebird. The special edition Formula Firehawk that appeared in 1991 was still available, although a lot of dealers were unaware of its existence. Lack of awareness and a sky high price tag conspired to keep the sales figures down on the special Firehawk. As for the rest of the line, new exterior colors were available, including a bright "Jamaica Yellow". One interior color was changed, from the camel colored beechwood to a greyish beige. Convertibles were still available. One improvement made on all 1992 f-bodies was the addition of some extra bonding agents to stiffen the structure of the cars. The extra bonding was an attempt to correct squeaks and rattles that some owners had complained about. This also allowed GM to experiment with some of the new technologies which were to be implemented on the fourth generation cars. Mid-year, TPI-equipped cars only received blank throttle body plates rather than ones that had been marked "TUNED PORT INJECTION" on similar engines in prior model years; and black-painted valve covers replaced the silver components from previous years. As use of the L98 in the Corvette had come to an end, rough-cast runners found their way into L98-equipped Firebirds, and some cars received special rubber snubbers on the rear hatch frame that were designed to make the hatch more stable. This would be the last year for the light weight deep dish cross-laced wheels that had been available since 1987, and had been styled to look like expensive aftermarket rims. It would be the last year for the GTA, the last year for concealed windshield wipers, and the last year for the aerodynamic body with the long hood and low roofline. It was also the last year for full leather covering on the front seats. Some GTA's ended up with drum brakes on the rear, presumably because of a shortage of disk brake parts. Buyers were compensated for the downgrade. Ultimately, very few Trans Ams, GTA's, and Formulas were produced in this model year, as most buyers were waiting for the next-generation models.

Bowsprit tortoise

The bowsprit tortoise ("Chersina angulata"), known in southern Africa as the angulate tortoise or rooipens, is a species of tortoises found in dry areas and scrub forest in South Africa. This tortoise in the only known member of the genus Chersina.
Name and taxonomy.
This species is highly distinctive and is now classified by itself, in the monotypic "Chersina" genus. While it differs considerably from all other tortoise species, its closest relatives, according to phylogenetic studies, are the tiny "Padloper" ("Homopus") tortoise species, with which it shares its southern African habitat.
Internationally it is known by the two names of "Angulate" and "Bowsprit" tortoise. Locally in southern Africa however, it is uniformly known as the "Angulate tortoise" in English, and as the "Rooipens skilpad" ("Red-bellied tortoise") in Afrikaans.
Description.
Identification.
A small, shy tortoise with a relatively variable shell, they can often be distinguished by their prominent "bowsprits", which are protrusions of the "gular" shields, from their plastrons under their chins. 
These are used by males to fight for territory or females. Uniquely, this species has only one gular shield under its chin; all other southern African tortoises have a divided/double scaled gular. Angulate specimens have 5 claws on their front legs and 4 on each back leg. They also, like most other southern African tortoises, have a nuchal scute.
Regional variation.
There is considerable regional variation in this species of tortoise. Individuals from the west coast of southern Africa tend to have a reddish colour, especially on the underside of their shell (from where their Afrikaans name of ""Rooipens"" or "red-belly" comes). Inland specimens from the Karoo region are often darker, and some are known to be uniformly black. To the east of their range, individuals are typically smaller and have a lighter colour. Such tendencies can be diluted by admixture however, and in all populations individuals tend to assume a uniform brown colour in old age.
Sexual dimorphism.
This species shows considerable difference between male and female individuals. 
The males tend to be larger, to have concave bellies, and to have a longer, thinner, "peanut" shape. They also have enlarged and extended gular scutes under their chins, which they use for sparring with each other. 
The females tend to be smaller and rounder, with a flat or slightly convex belly. 
Natural range.
Their natural habitat is the "fynbos, karoo, albany thickets" and coastal scrub (""Strandveld"") vegetation of the south-western part of South Africa. This is an area of semi-arid and mediterranean climate, with winter-rainfall. Within this climatic range however, the bowsprit tortoise is a tough and very adaptable species. 
Geographically, this natural range extends across the Cape Floristic Region, as far north as the southern part of Namibia. In addition, small colonies have been introduced by tourists to domestic gardens in Swakopmund and Walvis Bay, even further north, in central Namibia. To the east, its range extends along the Cape's southern coast as far as East London. 
There is also an especially dense colony on Dassen Island, off the South African coast.
Throughout its range, this tortoise usually occurs in the greatest numbers near the coast. Inland it occurs at lesser densities, though smaller populations are even found in parts of the Karoo.
Human interaction and captivity.
The bowsprit tortoise is commonly kept as a garden pet in South Africa. However the species is classified as "Protected Wild Animal" in the "Nature Conservation Ordinance No. 19 (2000)", and it is therefore strictly illegal to remove this animal from the wild. It may also not be transported, possessed, imported or exported without a permit. 
A commonly reported problem is that, when a tortoise is spotted crossing rural roads, drivers tend to stop, pick it up and take it home - away from its habitat in the wild. This is illegal and traumatic for the tortoise. Instead drivers are encouraged to stop and, if they wish, assist it crossing the road in the direction that it was going. 
Nonetheless, there is a legal and regulated pet trade in this tortoise, especially for captive-bred specimens. However it is absolutely imperative to attain a permit when buying, selling or keeping this species.
Diet.
If kept in a garden, these tortoises need a sizable warm, dry area with a diverse range of possible plant foods. 
They naturally eat a wide variety of indigenous South African plants and, if kept in a garden, they require a similarly wide range of edible plants available, on which to feed. They will not stay healthy if fed only one food type, such as lettuce. 
Domestic dangers.
If the garden is suburban, then it should be securely walled, so that the tortoise does not wander into the nearby streets and traffic. 
The property should also not have a swimming pool, as the bowsprit tortoise cannot swim (unlike many larger tortoise species), and will drown if it falls into deep water. 
Domestic dogs are a threat to captive tortoises, which are often badly injured or killed after being severely chewed on. 
If kept in groups, females never clash, however males are fiercely territorial and will fight each other at any opportunity. Males should therefore ideally be kept separately from other males. 
Sun and temperature.
This tortoise, like most reptiles, also needs to be able to regulate its own temperature, by moving between sunny and shady spots. It therefore needs a large garden where it can move about, so as to seek both natural sunlight, as well as shade, when necessary. It needs a dry habitat, as constant moisture is particularly bad for it. 
Illegal trade and exports.
Like many species of tortoises, the bowsprit is increasingly threatened by illegal collecting for the pet trade. When transported outside of their natural range and climate, these tortoises usually die. This is partly because they are adapted to the warm, dry, Mediterranean-type climate of the Cape, but also because they require a wide range of plant foods, which they typically do not receive when they are kept as pets by inexperienced keepers. 
Internationally, the species is regulated by the CITES, or "Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora" (Appendix II), as well as other legislation on their international trade.

Dry Doddington

Dry Doddington is a small village in the north-west of the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated approximately south-east from Newark, approximately north-west from Grantham, and just over to the east from the A1 road.
Geography.
The village, on a small hill called Lincoln Hill, is surrounded by the River Witham to the west and south. The village of Claypole is to the north and Westborough and Long Bennington 1 mile to the south. The East Coast Main Line passes 1 mile to the north-east.
History.
Dry Doddington means the "dry estate of a man called Dodda". There was a deserted medieval village called 'Stocking' or 'Stockyng' associated with Dry Doddington in the early 14th century; its precise location is unknown. 
Dry Doddington CE School was built as a National School in 1872, but was closed between 1926 and 1929, after which it re-opened as a primary school. It closed for the last time in 1961. 
Today, the village forms part of the civil parish of Westborough and Dry Doddington, which had a population of 335 in 2001. Before 1931 Dry Doddington was a separate parish. 
The village public house is The Wheatsheaf Inn on Main Street.
The Church of St James.
The parish church is dedicated to St James, which has a west-ward leaning tower.
It is a Grade II* listed building dating from the 12th century, with an early 14th-century tower. It was restored in 1876.
The church contains a memorial to a No. 49 Squadron RAF Avro Lancaster that crashed near the village on 26 November 1944. The aircraft, called 'O-Oboe', was piloted by F/O Le Marquand (PB432). It had only been in the air for a few minutes before it crashed, laden with bombs and fuel. Whilst five members of the crew survived, Norman Langley, the wireless operator and air gunner, and Edward Blake, the mid-upper gunner, were killed.

Hypocalymma robustum

Hypocalymma robustum (Swan River Myrtle) is a species of shrub in the myrtle family Myrtaceae. It is endemic to the south west region of Western Australia.
It usually grows up to between 0.4 and 1 metre in height. 
Pink flowers are produced between June and November (early winter to late spring) in its native range.
The species was initially given the name "Leptospermum robustum" without description, and later formally described by botanist John Lindley in "Edward's Botanical Register" in 1843. 
Cultivation.
Its attractive flowers and compact size make it a desirable garden plant. However, it does need a climate where the summers are dry.
It requires good drainage and prefers a sunny or partially shaded position and has moderate frost resistance. Propagation is from semi-mature cuttings or seed.

Luigi Pasinetti

Luigi L. Pasinetti (born September 12, 1930) is an Italian economist of the Post-Keynesians school. Pasinetti is considered the heir of the "Cambridge Keynesians" and a student of Piero Sraffa and Richard Kahn. Along with them, as well as Joan Robinson, he was one of the prominent members on the "Cambridge, UK" side of the Cambridge capital controversy. His contributions to economics include developing the analytical foundations of Neo-Ricardian economics, including the theory of value and distribution, as well as work in the line of Kaldorian theory of growth and income distribution. He has also developed the theory of structural change and economic growth, structural economic dynamics and uneven sectoral development.
Biography.
Luigi Lodovico Pasinetti was born on September 12, 1930, in Zanica, near Bergamo, in the north of Italy. He began his economics studies at Milan's Università Cattolica, where he obtained his “laurea” degree in 1954. The thesis that he presented dealt with econometric models applied to the analysis of the trade cycle. As a brilliant student, he won several scholarships for graduate studies which gained him access to University of Cambridge, England (1956 and 1958), Harvard University, USA (1957) and Oxford University, England (1959) for his graduate studies. In 1960 Oxford's Nuffield College granted him a Research Fellowship that he enjoyed until 1962, the year in which he left the University for Cambridge, called there by the prestigious economist Lord Richard Kahn.
In those years,
Years later, Pasinetti, remembering Kahn in a Memorial Service held at King's College Chapel, University of Cambridge on 21 October 1989, recalled that:
Richard Goodwin was also part of this brilliant group of Cambridge economists, and exerted the first important influence on Pasinetti. In conveying the intellectual debt he owed him, Pasinetti writes:
In 1960-1961 Pasinetti became a Fellow of King's College. Twelve years later in 1973, he was appointed Reader at the Cambridge, a post that he kept until his return to the Università Cattolica Milano in 1976. In March 1963 he was awarded his doctorate degree from Cambridge University with a Ph. Dissertation on "A Multi-sector Model of Economic Growth." This thesis was the core of what came to be in 1981 one of his most complete books, "Structural Change and Economic Growth". In 1964 he was appointed Professor of Econometrics at the Università Cattolica and in 1981 full Professor of Economic Analysis. Trips between Cambridge and Milan were very frequent during this period. In 1971 and 1975 he was appointed Visiting Research Professor at Columbia University as well as in 1979 at the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta and the Delhi School of Economics.
Back at his "Alma Mater", Università Cattolica Milano, he was appointed Chairman of the Faculty of Economics from 1980 to 1983, Director of the Department of Economics (1983–1986) and later Director of the Joint Economics Doctoral Program (comprising three Milanese Universities: Università Cattolica, Bocconi University and University of Milan) from 1984–86 and again from 1995-98.
The list of academic distinctions and honours he has received till now is long. The most prominent ones are: St. Vincent prize for economics (1979), President of the "Società Italiana degli Economisti" (1986–89), President of the "European Society for the History of Economic Thought" (1995–1997), Member of the "Executive Committee of the International Economic Association", Member of the "Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei", "Doctor Honoris Causa" at the University of Friburg (1986), "Invernizzi" Prize for Economics (1997). At present Pasinetti is also Honorary President of: the "International Economic Association", the "European Society for the History of Economic Thought", the "International Economic Association, the European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy", the "Italian Association for the History of Political Economy" and the "Italian Association for the History of Economic Thought".
He has also provided valuable contributions to several major economic journals such as editorial advisor to: the "Cambridge Journal of Economics" (since 1977), the "Journal of Post Keynesian Economics" (since its founding in 1978), "Kyklos" (1981), "Structural Change and Economic Dynamics" (since 1989), and "PSL Quarterly Review" (2009) to name a few.
Pasinetti is currently Emeritus Professor at the Università Cattolica Milano.
Theoretical contributions.
A mathematical formulation of the Ricardian system.
Pasinetti’s first major contribution to economics was probably "the mathematical formulation of the Ricardian system", published in 1960 in a paper now considered classical. In such work Pasinetti presented a very concise and elegant (and pedagogically effective) analysis of the basic aspects of classical economics.
At that time, Piero Sraffa had just published "The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo", one of the most masterful editorial works ever to be published in economics; and scholars were wondering how Sraffa’s remarkable work could clarify and enrich the interpretation of "Classical economics". Pasinetti’s mathematical formulation provided a rigorous and clear answer to that question, in particular with "reference" to two major Classical problems: the "theory of value" and the "theory of income distribution".
On this subject, a major stimulus came from a famous paper written by Nicholas Kaldor, in 1956, where Kaldor presented a review of the history of several theories of distribution, covering the period from Ricardo to Keynes. Although Ricardo's theory (in Kaldor's paper) was without equations, it was the starting point after which economists began to explicitly see the Ricardian model as a coherent whole, susceptible to mathematical formalization.
Another influence came directly from Sraffa and concerned the relative prices of goods produced in the economic system made to depend only on the amount of labour embodied in them – the well known "labour theory of value". In fact, an early draft of Pasinetti’s paper was read by Sraffa, who gave his approval to almost the entire paper:
Pasinetti explains that"“the more constructive approach is taken of stating explicitly the assumptions needed in order to eliminate the ambiguities”" in the Ricardian model, hence, the reason for the mathematical formulation.
In this view, the most straightforward mathematical Ricardian model that can be formulated, with "minimal economic" complications, is the one in which only one commodity is produced (‘corn’ for instance), and where there are three social classes: capitalists who earn profits, workers who earn wages and landowners whose income comes from the rent of land. This is the way to express Kaldor’s model mentioned above. Although the Pasinetti model is more general and comprises two sectors (agriculture and manufacturing), it is illuminating to start with the simplest version –a one-commodity model expressed by the following equations:
Equation "(1.1)" shows that output, "Y", depends only on the number of workers, "N", engaged to work on the land. Three conditions "(1.1a)" are necessary and help to restrict the meaning of "(1.1)". Specifically, the first displays that land, when workers are not employed, can produce something or nothing at all. The second condition shows that the marginal product to kick start the cultivation of land must be greater than "μ", the subsistence wage; otherwise the system will never start working. The third condition shows the diminishing returns of labour. The following equations show the determination of the quantities of different categories of income:
where "W" are the total wages," x" is the wage per worker, "K" is the capital of the economy, "R" is the total rents perceived by landowners and "B" are the total profits that go into the hands of capitalists. The latter are represented as a residual income once the rents and wages have been paid. In these models all the capital is working capital; it is assumed to be composed entirely of advances to workers as wages. Notice, moreover, that expression "(1.4)", supplemented by technical conditions "(1.1a)", expresses what still today is called the Ricardian theory of rent.
Hitherto we need two more equations to close the model. They are:
Equation "(1.6)" shows that long-term wages tend to subsistence level. Equation "(1.7)" shows the stock of capital at the beginning of the year. Throughout the construction of his model, Pasinetti insists that he is interested in "natural solutions" of the Ricardian model, i.e., those to which the system tends to in the long term.
Thus, equation "(1.6)" does not preclude short-termwage deviations with respect to its natural level. Eventually, note that "μ" is the only magnitude which is determined from outside the system: it is an amount set by customs and habits of society. This means that the number of workers employed (proportional to population), is determined by the system itself, unlike what happens in modern theories of economic growth, where the rate of population growth is taken as exogenously given.
The previous model allows us to see the basic features of Ricardo’s distribution theory. However, no reference can be made to anything about the theory of value, since all the magnitudes are measured in terms of ‘corn’. As Pasinetti says: "“where any question of evaluation has not yet arisen, corn being the single commodity produced”". However, by enlarging the model to a two-sector model, more remarkable features of Ricardian economics emerge. The two sectors include: the basic goods sector (wage goods called ‘corn’) and a luxury goods sector (called ‘gold’). The whole new model appears as:
Equations "(2.1)" to "(2.7)" are identical to those of the single sector model, but now they bear added subscripts to differentiate the production of ‘corn’ from that of ‘gold’. Equation "(2.8)" presents the gold production function which, unlike the ‘corn’ production function, exhibits constant returns to scale. The parameter is the physical amount of ‘gold’ produced by a worker in a year. The next two equations show in monetary (nominal terms) the wage rate (‘corn’) per worker and the rate of profit:
where "p1" and "p2" represent the price of ‘corn’ and the price of ‘gold’ respectively. Pasinetti supposes that the wage rate and the rate of profit are identical in both sectors thanks to free market competition. Note also from "(2.10)" that only "p1" (the price of corn) enters wage determination, since it is assumed that workers in both sectors only receive only 'corn' as wages; in a terminology later developed by Sraffa, ‘corn’ is the only basic commodity produced in the system. The same consideration can be made, from the opposite view, looking at "(2.11)", since the only capital involved is represented by advances in the form of ‘corn’. Hence "K" appears as multiplied by "p1". The following two equations are Ricardo's implicit assumptions -that the "natural price" of any good is given by its cost of production:
Equation "(2.12)" allows the determination of the total monetary profits of the gold industry. Equation "(2.13)" is much more important. It shows that on balance, the value of output per worker is the same in both sectors. It should be noted that the product of sector 1 (agriculture) is considered free of rents. To achieve this result, both the wage rate and the rate of profit have been considered homogeneous in both sectors, and the capital/labour ratio must also be considered as identical.
Pasinetti closes the model with two further equations:
Relationship "(2.14)" simply adopts the amount of ‘gold’ as numeràire; hence, it is equal to unity. Relation "(2.15)" displays the income distribution between the different social classes. Ricardo supposes that workers spend their entire wages to buy 'corn', capitalists reinvest their profits in capital accumulation, and landowners spend all their rents on luxury goods. The simplicity of this argument about consumption functions for each social class enables Pasinetti to close the whole circuit of income distribution with a single equation. Specifically, "(2.15)" shows that landowners spend all their income received as rents, "p1R", in the buying of luxury goods, "p2X2". There is no need for more equations, since "“the determination of the demand for one of the two commodities (gold in our example) also determines, implicitly, the demand for the other commodity (corn), since total output is already functionally determined”".
The system presented above (15 equations with 15 unknowns) displays the natural solutions of the Ricardian economic system, i.e. those solutions attained in the long term and corrected for market distortions and imbalances in the short term. Ricardo did not deny the existence of such deviations, but for his analysis, they were not the relevant issues. These solutions, furthermore, as demonstrated mathematically by Pasinetti exist, they are unique, and, moreover, their steady state solutions are stable. On the other hand, it can be demonstrated that if we take the partial derivatives of all variables with respect to "K", (because the process of capital accumulation is what matters for the dynamics of the model) the evolution of the variables is consistent with the conclusions which Ricardo reached; especially with the tendency of the whole economic system in the long run towards a stationary state.
The above model has several outstanding aspects. The foremost of which is a theory of income distribution entirely independent of the theory of value. The inclusion of a new sector -and consequently the whole structure of relative prices- have not even slightly changed the way income is distributed among landowners, workers and capitalists. At the same time, prices though of course not equal to, are exactly proportional to the quantity of labour embodied in each commodity. This is a perfectly clear "labour theory of value".
The attentive reader may notice that the two major results (on income distribution and on value respectively) depend on two assumptions that are implicit in the formulation of the model, i.e. of the above set of equations, namely: 1) that capitalists appropriate the whole surplus of the economic system, after paying rents to landowners, and conventional wages to workers; and 2) that the proportion of labour to capital is exactly the same in all sectors. These two assumptions have given rise to endless discussions on value and distribution ever since.
Further work undertaken by Pasinetti’s has been concerned with reversing the causal chain of the first assumption and in rendering the second assumption superfluous.
The Cambridge equation and the Pasinetti’s Theorem.
Kaldor´s 1956 article already mentioned above (“Alternative Theories of Distribution”) was at the origin of another ‘seminal’ paper written by Pasinetti. Kaldor had reviewed the major theories of distribution throughout the history of economics from Ricardo to the Marginalists and even to Kalecki. But then, he added a theory which he named the Keynesian theory of income distribution. This was a surprise because these issues were never treated by Keynes in an explicit way. Kaldor baptized his theory as ‘Keynesian’ because it succeeded in catching a few important concepts both from Keynes’s Treatise’s widow's cruise allegory and from Kalecki’s profits equation.
In any case, in this paper Kaldor reached remarkable results. Starting from a closed economic system, without government, and in which there are capitalists and workers, starting from the saving-investment identity, Kaldor came to the following identity between investments and savings:
where "Y" is the national income, "P" is the volume of total profits, "sw" is the workers propensity to save, "sc" is the capitalists propensity to save and "I" is investment. If we suppose that workers do not save ("sw=0"), divide both members by "K" and remember that in dynamic equilibrium "I/K = gn", we get:
where "gn" is the natural rate of growth and "k" is the capital/output ratio. Finally, note that these two expressions only have economic significance in the range:
This interval excludes equilibrium with negative shares, either by the workers (first inequality) or by the capitalists (second inequality).
The expressions "(3.1)" and "(3.2)" are those that have subsequently formed the core of the post-Keynesian distribution theory; but only after an extremely hard-fought debate. Equation "(3.1)" shows that the share of profits in total output depends positively on the natural rate of growth and the capital/output ratio and negatively on the propensity to save of the capitalist class. The second of these relations, "(3.2)", better known as the “Cambridge equation”, shows that the profit rate is solely determined by the ratio of the natural rate of growth and the propensity to save of capitalists.
The importance of these expressions became clear only after an intense debate. These expressions were achieved with an additional assumption that was heavily criticized. Kaldor’s assumption was that the workers propensity to save was zero. Specifically, if you eliminate this assumption, the above formulas lose their conciseness, depending on the propensity to save of workers. This assumption was explicitly criticized because, whatever justification it might have had in the early days of industrialization, it appeared to have no sense in contemporary times. If you eliminate this assumption, the above formulas lose not only their conciseness, but also their applicability to the industrial systems of our own days.
Pasinetti went into this debate with his 1962 paper. With his now famous Pasinetti Theorem, he achieved the result of re-stating Kaldor’s original equations without the need to rely on Kaldor’s much criticized assumptions. It is worth quoting the first time that Pasinetti presented his views about these issues to an audience:
In his 1962 paper, Pasinetti showed that Kaldor had fallen into a "logical slip". He implicitly assumed that the total profits only came from the capitalists and he neglected the workers. In other words, ""By attributing all profits to the capitalists it has inadvertently but necessarily implied that worker's savings are always totally transferred as a gift to the capitalists"". That is to say the saving function of Kaldor's model ought to be modified so as to include both workers profits and capitalist profits, i.e.:
Under this assumption the Investment = Savings identity becomes:
If this expression is cleared as before, we see that formal results are similar to "(3.1)" and "(3.2)", but now they only refer to that part of profits that accrue to the capitalists. Specifically, the modified Cambridge equation would take this peculiar form:
Note that the preceding equation now shows not the profit rate of the economy, "P/K", but a ratio, "Pc /K", which has no economic significance if taken as such. To fix this anomaly, Pasinetti added "Pw /K", to both sides of the equality:
To complete the formulation, Pasinetti simply assumes that, in the long-term, the variable "i", representing the interest rate earned by workers when they lend their savings to capitalists, is equal to the profit rate, "P/K". Taking that into account and simplifying, we obtain:
i.e., exactly the preceding "(3.2)" equation. In other words, we obtain the “Cambridge equation” again, but this time without the assumption "sw = 0". By a similar procedure Pasinetti shows that the share of total profits in total income again emerges the same as "(3.1)"; i.e., the Pasinetti Theorem proves that in the long run, the propensity to save of the workers has no effect on the determination of the overall profit rate of the economy, and also has no effect on the determination of the share of the total profits in the national income. At the same time, however, the propensity to save of the workers determines the distribution of profits between workers and capitalists.
With these outcomes, the truly important point is that Kaldor’s original formulae are much more general than was previously believed. As Pasinetti says, “the irrelevance of worker’s propensity to save gives the model a much wider generality than was hitherto believed. Since the rate of profit and the income distribution between profits and wages are determined independently of sw, there is no need for any hypothesis whatever on the aggregate savings behaviour of the workers." 
The conclusions obtained from Pasinetti’s Theorem led to a huge number of scientific works and papers, with the purpose of clarifying the nature of the Theorem and its more important implications. Specifically, in 1966, Paul A. Samuelson and Franco Modigliani, the MIT economists, wrote a detailed and widely quoted paper where they tried to minimize the consequences of the Pasinetti Theorem and to lessen the generality of its conclusions.
The argument centred on the inequality shown above, crucial to the solution of the Cambridge equation, namely on:
Samuelson and Modigliani proposed that the following inequality (which they called anti-Pasinetti’s inequality) was also reasonable, and claimed that it would endow the model with greater generality:
Such inequality, however, requires that the workers' propensity to save becomes so high as to allow them to accumulate capital at a greater speed than capitalists. If this were to happen, in the end the total capital of the economy would entirely be owned by the workers, while the capitalists would disappear.
The formulation of the anti-Pasinetti range and all theoretical justification (and some empirical exercises) proposed by Samuelson and Modigliani was challenged by Pasinetti and in a much more critical way by Kaldor and Joan Robinson.
Kaldor founded his criticism on the lack of realism of the assumptions made by Samuelson and Modigliani, while performing a remarkable study on the empirical values of the saving propensities of workers and capitalists (based on data from National Accounts for United States and United Kingdom). Kaldor concluded that, "“unless they make a more imaginative effort to reconcile their theoretical framework with the known facts of experience, their economic theory is bound to remain a barren exercise.”" 
Pasinetti preferred, with his reply to Samuelson and Modigliani, to remain at a higher level of analysis – by pointing out the weaknesses of the logical analysis of the two MIT economists. Nonetheless Pasinetti joined Kaldor’s critique concerning the highly restrictive assumptions made by the neoclassical economists:
For Pasinetti, the principal issue of the debate is the way in which technology is defined. If "sw<gnK/Y" the Cambridge equation would still stand, regardless of which assumption is made about the technology (i.e., whatever the form of the production function), while if "sw>gnK/Y", the shape of technology does play a crucial role, so that "“The Meade-Samuelson-Modigliani’s marginal productivity results only follow on particular and unacceptable assumptions on technology.”"
Pasinetti went on to argue that, even with the particular and unacceptable assumptions on technology, the Samuelson-Modigliani range of applicability would hardly have any practical significance. In fact, even though the Cambridge equation might not exactly determine the rate of profits, it would nevertheless determine its upper limit. First, the rate of profit (whatever way it is determined) cannot be higher than "gn/sc". Secondly, the rate of profit cannot be lower than gn (for, if it were, that would mean that individuals would contribute more to economic growth than they receive in exchange for profits, which is patently an absurdity).
So, even if in the range of Samuelson and Modigliani the rate of profit were to be determined by the marginal productivities (and not by the Cambridge equation as in the general case), its scope would be extremely limited, being confined to a quasi knife-edge range:
The Cambridge equation with the public sector.
Already in the 70's the debate of the original Pasinetti Theorem, and hence the Samuelson-Modigliani's interval, took a turning point, by reaching a second phase in which "“many authors proceeded to relax assumptions, trying out new hypotheses and introducing complications of all sorts”". Indeed, already in the 60s some economists, inspired by Kaldor's paper of 1966, began to introduce in the Cambridge model some issues related to financial assets, interest rates and the functioning of financial markets and big corporations. All these contributions, as well as those which were made later in the 1970s and 1980s, were made in order to give the Cambridge model a wider applicability and more "explicit realism".
It was in 1972, thanks to a remarkable paper by Steedman, that the public sector was explicitly included in the Cambridge equation. Though 16 years had elapsed since the original paper by Kaldor, no formal attempt had been made in that period to introduce the government sector and its ensuing complications. The case is more striking if one considers that Kaldor was an expert adviser on tax issues, tax theory and public finance. This is due to the aforementioned fact that throughout that period the economists were mainly concerned about the analytical properties of the outcome of the Pasinetti Theorem.
In fact, Steedman's 1972 paper was an original and very constructive way to resolve the theoretical dispute between Pasinetti and Samuelson-Modigliani. Steedman showed that if the public sector was considered, under the assumption of budget equilibrium, the long run solutions were consistent with Pasinetti’s solutions, and never with the "dual" solutions of Samuelson-Modigliani. This means that the introduction of the public sector meant that the profit rate remained independent of the workers propensity to save and of the capital-output ratio (technology).
The "enlarged Cambridge equation", which Steedman arrived at was:
where "tp" is the tax rate (average and marginal) on profits. In the case that "tp=0" (there are no taxes on profits), we obtain the original Cambridge equation. As it can be easily seen, neither the workers' propensity to save, nor technology, nor even the tax rate on wages affect to the rate of profit of the economy, and hence they do not affect to the distribution between wages and profits.
Pasinetti entered the debate again in 1989 showing that -whether the government’s budget was in deficit or surplus- the main results of the Cambridge equation hold. If the government budget was not balanced, the Cambridge equation would take the following form:
where "s’c" is a “propensity to save of capitalists corrected”, meaning that it takes into account both the direct taxation on profits and the indirect taxation, "ti" (on capitalists' consumption) as well as the government propensity to save, "sT", i.e.:
Although the expression of the capitalists’ propensity to save is not as simple as the original, the truly remarkable thing is that no matter what hypothesis are adopted about the government budget, the Cambridge equation continues to hold, by depending on the natural rate of growth divided by the capitalists' propensity to save, independently of workers' propensity to save and the technology.
Equation "(4.1)" - and "(4.2)" - can be viewed from another point of view: they can be expressed in terms of profit after taxes:
The long-run rate of profits is given by the natural growth rate divided by the capitalists’ propensity to save, independently of anything else. That is to say, "the original Cambridge equation can be said to refer to the rate of profit net of taxes", not to "the rate of profit before taxes".
The most important conclusion to be drawn from this analysis is that if we consider two identical economies (with the same natural rate of growth and saving propensities), if the first has a higher tax rate on profits, the second economy will enjoy a higher rate of profits before taxes (and also a higher share of profits in total income). That is to say, the presence of government has a redistributive effect per se in favour of profits and against wages. This important and surprising conclusion should not sound new, for, as stated by Pasinetti:
The Controversy on the theory of Capital.
Alongside the contributions made to the Cambridge model of growth and income distribution, in the 1960s, Pasinetti joined what has become known in economic literature as the controversy on capital theory between the two Cambridges: i.e., Cambridge (United Kingdom), whose most prominent scholars were Joan Robinson, Luigi Pasinetti, Piero Sraffa and Nicholas Kaldor and Cambridge, Massachusetts (U.S.A) whose members were Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow, David Levhari and Edwin Burmeister.
Controversies over the nature and importance of capital were not new. In the early 20th century, the economist John Bates Clark, in an effort to refute Marx’s surplus theory, suggested that wages and profits (or rather interest, as they were called by Neoclassical economists, owing to their assumption that rate of profit and rate of interest coincide) were simply considered as prices, obtained from the marginal productivity of the factors of production; a theory synthesized by J.B. Clark’s famous statement, that "what a social class gets is, under natural law, what it contributes to the general output of industry". In this debate, Veblen and Böhm-Bawerk were also involved, proposing slightly different, but basically similar, theories to that of J. B. Clark.
In 1930 Hayek re-opened the debate by linking lower interest rates with more indirect methods of production, i.e., with higher capital/labor ratios. Since the interest rate was for Hayek the price of capital, it was clear that Hayek (as all Neoclassical economists) thought that lower interest rates would lead to more capital-intensive production methods. With the outbreak of the Great Depression, the debates around capital theory were abandoned, and it was not until 1953, due to a paper by Joan Robinson, that the topic was again given prominence.
Robinson opened the controversy with a now famous statement, with which she exposes the main problems of the traditional concept of capital as follows:
Although initially the debate was focused on the measurement of capital, more basic questions quickly began to emerge concerning the validity of the neoclassical production functions. If capital could be measured in some way, and if one assumed constant returns to scale, diminishing marginal productivities, given technology, competitive equilibrium and the production of a single good, the production function allowed getting three noteworthy conclusions:
The assumption of the production of a single good was crucial, as it allowed the measurement of capital in physical units while no valuation problem arose. However, in a model with many goods (heterogeneous capital), the possibility of aggregation could not be avoided and always remained very problematic.
In 1962 Paul Samuelson wrote an important paper, which preceded and in fact provoked the subsequent debate. He proposed to solve the problem of the aggregation of capital through a new concept, the "surrogate production function". "“What I propose to do here is to show that a new concept, the ‘surrogate production function’, can provide some rationalization for the validity of the simple J. B. Clark parables which pretend there is a single thing called ‘capital’ that can be put into a single production function and along with labor will produce total output.”" 
The problem is that in this way, in order to add capital and put it into an aggregate production function, one must assess the capital as a stream of discounted monetary flows to be produced in the future; which implies an interest rate. The possibly adverse effects of changes in interest rates on capital value are basically two: the re-adoption of earlier discarded techniques ("reswitching") and "capital reversing".
"Reswitching" is basically the possibility that the same method of production may became most profitable one at more than one rate of profit, i.e., a production method may become the most profitable one both at low and at high rates of return, even when in the medium range it is dominated by other methods.
"Capital-reversing" occurs when moving from one technique to another, the technique chosen at a lower level of the rate of profit requires less capital value while earlier it required more capital value.
Pasinetti published a famous article in the "Symposium" of the "Quarterly Journal of Economics" in 1966, which was actually an adaptation and expansion of an article that was presented to the "First World Congress of the Econometric Society" in Rome one year earlier. Pasinetti set out to show that the theorem stated a year earlier by David Levhari and Paul Samuelson, which was supposed to demonstrate the impossibility of "reswitching" at the aggregate level, was false. Although in 1960 Sraffa had shown that "reswitching" was a possibility, no one had considered in depth such contribution. As Pasinetti said at the beginning of his 1966 article:
Later he adds: "“This result, owing to its theoretical implications, has been rather worrying; and there has been a general reluctance to consider it.”" 
The paper begins by setting a numerical example that shows -by constructing two alternative techniques- that even satisfying all Levhari and Samuelson hypotheses, "reswitching" is a possibility at the aggregate level. Then Pasinetti set up a theoretical analysis to find out where the error was in Levhari's proof. Clearly, if the numerical example above refuted the theorem –as it did-, "“It means that their logical arguments must have gone wrong at some stage”".
The conclusions of the article were truly remarkable, for if a monotonic relationship between profit rate and capital-labour ratio could not hold, the production function concept was meaningless. Therefore he concluded that:
The other major contribution of Pasinetti to the debate on capital theory was a 1969 paper titled "“Switches of Technique and the ‘Rate of Return’ in Capital Theory”". In this paper, Pasinetti showed that the concept of the rate of return on capital, introduced by Irving Fisher, and resumed and used by Solow in 1967 as a means of rescuing the neoclassical capital theory, had no economic significance.
Whichever of the two definitions given by Fisher on the rate of return was accepted, one of them was an accounting expression and in the other (in order to say anything on interest) would entail accepting a rather "unobtrusive postulate" in order to avoid the problem of "reswitching". That is, the concept of “rate of return”, which Solow thought was the central concept of the theory of capital, had no autonomous theoretical content. The conclusion of the article is an illuminating summary of the results concerning the debate on the theory of capital:
Lectures on the Theory of Production.
"Lectures on the Theory of Production" first appeared in Italian in 1975. Already in 1956 some parts of the book circulated in the form of lecture notes in several Italian universities. The insistence of students to give these notes a more structured and compact form prompted Pasinetti to compile these lectures, enlarging them and then bringing them to the form in which the book appeared.
This is the main reason why the "Lectures on the Theory of Production" turned out to be the most successful of his publications didactically (translated in French, Spanish, German and Japanese). The English version, appeared two years later, in 1977 and maintained the character and the structure of the Italian version, although Pasinetti added some enlargements, in the form of more sections and new appendices.
At a theoretical level, "Lectures on the Theory of Production" is a book dedicated to the analysis of the theory of production, that is, the way in which societies produce wealth and then how it is distributed. It is curious to notice the unusual way in which Pasinetti introduced his "Theory of Production". He begins Chapter I by contrasting two possible definitions of wealth:
In fact, the understanding of wealth as a stock can be useful for investigations at the level of single individuals; but at the macroeconomic level, it is wealth as a flow that is the most relevant concept. Therefore, Pasinetti considers it as a great contribution – made already by the Physiocratic school of 18th century France – to have concentrated on the concepts of surplus and economic activity presented as a circular flow in the "Tableau Economique", devised by François Quesnay. The Physiocratic ideas were developed by the Classical economists in Scotland and England and then by Marx. All of them saw the importance of production and wealth as a flow concept and further developed the Physiocratic ideas. Curiously enough, the Marginalist revolution of the late 19th century preferred to go back to study the concept of wealth as a stock, thus largely de-emphasizing the problems of production and distribution, and to focus on models of "pure exchange".
From this point onwards, Pasinetti develops and presents, in a terse way, a truly Classical theory of production. This book became a book from which a whole generation of Italian students (and in some Universities also non-Italian students) have learnt the theoretical scheme of Piero Sraffa, expressed in matrix notation (with a mathematical appendix devoted to the basic elements of matrix algebra) and the Input-Output analysis of Wassily Leontief.
In chapters 4, 5, and in an Appendix to Chapter 5, Pasinetti respectively deals with the Leontief model, with the Sraffa system, and Marx's transformation problem. He shows how, although the Leontief model and the Sraffa system were designed for different purposes, the former as an empirical tool and the latter as a theoretical framework, both have their basis in Physiocracy and Classical economics. The greatest theoretical achievement of the Sraffa system, Pasinetti says at the end of chapter 5, is that:
The last two chapters are useful summaries of problems Pasinetti has dealt with extensively throughout his career. Chapter 6 explains some of the controversies on capital theory, the problem about reswitching and its implications for traditional economic analysis. In an appendix to chapter 6, Pasinetti also touches on linear programming. He points out that "“unfortunately, linear programming was all too quickly constrained within the limits of traditional marginal analysis and lost its driving force”".
Chapter 7 is an introduction to dynamic production models and their implications for the theory of distribution. Pasinetti exposits his own contributions to this field as a summary of the Von Neumann model, showing both its merits and limitations. For the sake of brevity Pasinetti does not present here his contributions to the field of structural change. But, this last chapter can be considered a proper introduction to his book "Structural Change and Economic Growth", where all the problems of structural dynamics are widely discussed.
Structural Change and Economic Growth.
In 1981 “Structural Change and Economic Growth” appeared. It was a book that had been in gestation since 1963, when Pasinetti presented his PhD thesis at Cambridge on "A Multi-Sector Model of Economic Growth". Five of the nine chapters of the thesis had earlier been published in a long article in 1965. Afterward, Pasinetti rewrote and added some chapters to reach the total of 11 chapters with which the book appeared.
This book is a theoretical investigation on the long-term evolution of industrial systems. According to Pasinetti, such work surged from:
Leaving aside for a moment the technical aspects, we can say that overall the book is completely new for three reasons. To begin with, this was the first book to offer a unifying framework and a consistent alternative to that proposed by the Neoclassical theory. The latter strand of theory, which began in 1870, tried to explain the economic reality from a simpler view (exchange) under assumptions and analytical tools that were very restrictive, although its authors had the advantage that, “they have always clearly presented their arguments around a unifying problem (optimum allocation or scarce resources) and a unifying principle (the rational process of maximization under constraints).
It was therefore natural that contributions made in isolation and apart from Neoclassical economics were either discarded or transformed, doctored to fit into the neoclassical model. Pasinetti's purpose is therefore to offer an alternative paradigm and unify these theories in a new and solid set, which incorporates the contributions of Keynes, Kalecki, Sraffa, Leontief, the macrodynamics models of Harrod and Domar and the distribution theory of the post-Keynesian economists in Cambridge: the whole lit and dotted with some of the theories, ideas and concerns of the classical economists.
The second important point is that it is the first work in which Pasinetti does not solve a specific problem in isolation, but tries to offer a global vision of the economic process and integrates all the contributions he had made before. In this book we can find his ideas about Classical economics, income distribution, capital theory and the theory of joint production, all of them sorted out and assembled in order to explain the dynamics of industrial societies.
The third point is of a methodological nature, and is probably the most important of all. Following the Classical economists, Pasinetti thinks that it is possible to frame the study of "natural economic systems", i.e., economic systems free of institutions. In these natural systems it is possible to deduce a series of characteristics, principles and general laws, which are independent of the institutions that have to be introduced in later stages of investigation. These institutions are the ones that shape the features of real economic systems: for instance, a capitalist system or a socialist system. As he says, "“is a distinctive feature of the present theoretical scheme to begin by carrying out the whole analysis at a level of investigation which the Classical economists called ‘natural’, that is to say, at a level of investigation which is so fundamental as to be independent of the institutional set-up of society”".
Despite the high degree of abstraction of analysis, this method can provide answers to many real-world practical problems:
The six first chapters of the book provide the analytical core of the work. In them, Pasinetti sets the conditions for an economy with neither unemployment nor idle production capacity. Pasinetti's analysis always runs from the simple to the more general models. Thus - after studying the equilibrium conditions in the short run in chapter 2 - in chapter 3 he analyzes the most simplest of all growth models: population grows at a steady percentage rate, while technical, and demand coefficients (i.e., consumer preferences) remain constant over time.
With these assumptions, two types of conditions are necessary to reach the full employment of resources: the first one is a macroeconomic condition: total expenditure must be equal to total income; and the second is a set of sectoral conditions: each sector must have a rate of accumulation of capital sufficient to cover demand growth. Roughly, this is a series of "‘Harrod- Domar equations’": a specific Harrod- Domar equation must be satisfied in each particular sector.
The most important outcome of this analysis is that Pasinetti shows that, under such assumptions, it does not matter whether the analysis is carried out in macroeconomic terms or -in a more disaggregated way- in sectorial terms. As the system expands, while its proportions remain constant, the analysis does not lose any generality if carried out in aggregate terms. So, this is the case to which macroeconomic models of growth can be correctly applied. "“If the whole structure of the economic system were really to remain constant through time, any disaggregated formulation would not provided us with particularly useful insights, besides those that are provided already by the corresponding, much simpler, macroeconomic formulations.”"
Chapters 4 and 5 are devoted to the elaboration of a really relevant general multi-sector dynamic model. While chapter 5 is devoted to the exposition of such a model, in chapter 4 Pasinetti displays one of the most important ideas of the whole book: not only does technical progress affect the production methods of the economy, it also generates changes in the composition of demand. The way in which Pasinetti introduces the dynamic behaviour of demand over time is an up-dated resumption of Engel's Law, which when generalized states that higher and higher levels of income lead to constantly changing consumption patterns.
This way of looking at the demand side allows Pasinetti to reach three notable findings. The first is that learning is an individual characteristic which is more basic and more realistic than the rational behaviour postulated by traditional economics. If income changes over time -and thus consumer preferences also change- consumers must continually be learning about new goods to consume. This implies that, "“we can never expect each consumer to make the best possible consumption decisions”".
The second finding is that because of changing consumer preferences over time, it is inevitable that (short term) sectorial imbalances will arise due to the changing structure of the demands for goods. Therefore, this will be a permanent source of disequilibrium in the system.
The third finding is that demand is going to play a major role in determining the structure of the main macroeconomic variables over time. Even through the formation of long-term prices, demand has a vital role to play in shaping the production quantities:
The second part of the book, from chapters 7 to 11, develops all the consequences derived from the dynamic model of chapters 4 and 5. The long term evolution of the major variables is explained in its composition: employment, wages, profits and capital/output and capital/labour ratios. Chapter 8 also provides a drastic distinction between the interest rate and the profit rate; and this closes the theoretical framework of the entire book and makes it particularly complete and compact.
The last chapter (11) takes the conclusions and the scheme of the model in chapter 5 and applies them to international economic relations. This chapter appears as slightly different from the rest of the book, because it is devoted to analyzing economic systems with international trade and economic relations in general. It is a chapter that deals with open economies that not only trade with other economies, but try to import knowledge and "know-how". Pasinetti argues that the main benefits of international relations are in fact not so much those that derive from trade as those that derive from the international learning process between countries. Developing countries can strongly benefit from international relations if they succeed in imitating production methods from the developed countries. This is an encouraging possibility but has its limitations. Developing countries may not always be prepared to absorb all the technical methods of the developed countries because their lower levels of per capita income cause (according to Engel's law) the goods demanded in these countries to be different from those that are demanded in developed countries. The latter generally are not only much more sophisticated, but such as to require facilities that are not yet available in developing countries. In addition, Engel's law may require a strict order in consumption decisions.
The last paragraph of the book gives an excellent summary of the contents and the tone of Pasinetti’s book:
In 1993, Pasinetti returned to the problems of structural dynamics with a beautifully compact book ("Structural economic dynamics – a theory of the economic consequences of human learning"). Scant attention has been paid thus far to this book. The book explores the complex inter-relations between the structural change of production, of prices and of employment as a necessary consequence of human learning, by carrying out the whole analysis in terms of a “pure labour model”, i.e., a model in which labour, to be intended as human activity in general, is the only factor of production. This book has (incorrectly) been interpreted as an extreme simplification of the process of structural dynamics, and this may explain why it has been neglected so far. But in fact, it goes to the very heart of the complex movements that are taking place in post-industrial societies as an effect of the accumulation and diffusion of knowledge. When these aspects will be fully understood, it may well emerge as containing the most fundamental of all the theoretical concepts thus far conceived by Pasinetti to interpret the basic economic features of the newly shaped world in which we live.
Vertically integrated sectors and their importance for the dynamic analysis.
The deep study developed by Pasinetti in "Structural Change and Economic Growth" on the dynamics of growth of industrial systems led to the development of an entirely new analytical tool: the concept of "vertically integrated sectors".
In fact, in the 1965 paper, from which "Structural Change" was later developed, the notion of "vertically integrated sector" was already present, though more as a simplifying assumption than as a really important analytical concept. The publication of Sraffa's book "Production of commodities by means of commodities" in 1960 motivated Pasinetti to reflect on the importance of such a concept. As pointed out by Pasinetti:
In 1973 Pasinetti published a paper, ""The Notion of Vertical Integration in Economic Analysis"", which would be a milestone for the development of all the analytical implications of the concept and its relation to the inter-industry theoretical schemes of Input-Output type.
The concept of vertically integrated sector is implicitly contained in the work of many economists. Most macroeconomic models, in order to avoid the analysis of intermediate goods, use that notion. The question then is why the use of the concept of a "vertically integrated sector" is much more advantageous for the dynamic analysis that, for instance, the classic Input-Output models.
A vertically integrated sector is, above all, a purely theoretical construction. Each of these sectors is constructed behind each of the final goods production processes, so that these can be decomposed into two clearly distinguishable elements: an amount of labour and a quantity of capital goods. “In a vertically integrated model, the criterion is the process of production of a final commodity, and the problem is to build conceptually behind each final commodity a vertically integrated sector which, by passing through all the intermediate commodities, goes right back to the original inputs”.
The great advantage of this abstract construction is that, besides being much more relevant to the dynamic analysis, it can be easily converted by algebraic operations into an Input-Output scheme. The coefficients of production of a "vertically integrated model" are basically a linear combination of the coefficients of production of an Input-Output model. This means that it is possible to obtain empirical values of the "vertically integrated coefficients" for an economy. We need only to obtain the values of the production coefficients on each industry (as it is commonly done by the different national account agencies) as well as the capital data at current prices; then we take the transposed inverse matrix of the estimated coefficients and we multiplied it by the vector of capital stocks. This allows us to obtain the vector of "vertically integrated capital stock" of an industry, a vector that can be seen as a kind of composite good involved in the production of the final commodity considered, which Pasinetti calls unit of "vertically integrated productive capacity". A similar procedure is applied with respect to the coefficients of labour. Thus, each final good is summarized in a vertically integrated labour coefficient and a unit of vertically integrated productive capacity.
The importance of this algebraic manipulation is notable because it allows linking a measurable and observable magnitudes (corresponding to the Input-Output analysis) with more compact magnitudes which have a deeper economic significance for the dynamic analysis. Thus, both methods (Input-Output and vertical integration) are essentially different points of view to perceive the same thing.
Nonetheless, this relationship between the contribution of Pasinetti and Input-Output models, valid for a static analysis, vanishes in a dynamic analysis. The matrix of technical coefficients, i.e., the link between the two methods of analysis, evolves over time due to technical change and change of production methods in the economy. That is, we would require an Input-Output table at each point in time for the dynamic analysis of an economy. However, the movement of vertically integrated coefficients can be analyzed over time, as these relationships include the expressions of technical change. This is the reason why the analysis in terms of vertically integrated coefficients is most appropriate for dynamic analysis. We can go back, however, to an inter-sectoral analysis (Input-Output) with reference to any given point in time when we are interested in it.
As Pasinetti says:
The result that the vertically integrated technical coefficients can be set up independently of the vagaries of technical change is a result of such importance that it could lead us to reconsider much of the work on structural economic dynamics:
Keynes and the Cambridge Keynesians.
"Keynes and the Cambridge Keynesians" (2007) is the latest book published by Pasinetti. Therein, Pasinetti proposes to consider Keynesian economics as an alternative paradigm to Neoclassical economics, emphasizing the contributions of the Cambridge Keynesians as well as future development lines on these issues.
Probably, Pasinetti -recognized as the heir of the Cambridge economists-, is the most suitable economist to talk about that ambience, because, as he himself acknowledges:
The gestation period of the book, as is usual for Pasinetti's books, was long: about 15 years. In fact, with the notable exception of part three, the book is a collection of writings that Pasinetti had prepared years ago. Part three, on the other hand, is new and presumably the most important part of the book. That is, "Keynes and the Cambridge Keynesians" is composed of three parts or, more properly, of three Books.
Book I is a summary of what has been known as the "Keynesian Revolution". It is taken from set of lectures delivered by Pasinetti in memory of the Italian economist Federico Caffé, in October 1994 at La Sapienza University, Rome. In this Book, Pasinetti makes a chronological overview of the outbreak of the "Keynesian Revolution", from the first attempts of Keynes in the early 1930s, to the evolution of Keynesian thinking and the subsequent misinterpretation of his theory by the economists of the “Neoclassical synthesis”. Book I also contains some reflections on the progress of knowledge in economics and the rise and fall of scientific paradigms based on the work of the famous epistemologist Thomas Kuhn. The conclusions of Book I also advocate the revival of Keynesian economics with a touch of hope for future generations of economists:
Book II, entitled "The Cambridge School of Keynesian Economics" is by far the longest part of the book. It is composed of, in this order, by the biographies of Richard Kahn, Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Piero Sraffa and Richard Goodwin. All of them had already appeared in various places several years earlier, although for this book Pasinetti re-arranged them. The chapter on Kaldor, for example, is a synthesis of two articles written on different occasions. In terms of space, Sraffa is the economist treated in greatest detail by Pasinetti, dedicating to him three, quite independent biographical essays.
Besides the importance of each one of the biographies, the purpose of all of them is:
Book II ends with some suggestions, nine in total, which according to Pasinetti are at the heart of the "Keynesian Revolution". The issues involved are:
Finally, Book III is a conclusion, not only of the previous chapters of this volume, but also of the whole conception of how Pasinetti would like economic analysis to be carried out. He asserts the need to rise above and go beyond Neoclassical economics through a genuine resurgence of a Classical-Keynesian paradigm, which can be rescued and strengthened and developed by the methodology that Pasinetti has pursued during the whole of his life, made explicit for the first time in his "Structural Change and Economic Growth". Basically, he argues for the possibility of formulating, at a first level of investigation, a pure economic theory, independently from the institutional framework of society, and then, at a second level of investigation, of developing an analysis of the relevant institutions, thus achieving a theoretical framework that may allow us to understand the basic features of the monetary production economies in which we live today.

Saulius Mykolaitis (January 15, 1966 – February 18, 2006) was a Lithuanian director, actor, and singer-songwriter (bard).
Life.
Saulius Mykolaitis was born in Ramygala, a small city in Lithuania. His parents died while he was still studying at school. Saulius was raised by two older brothers Sigitas and Darius who bought him his first guitar when he was just seven years old.
Saulius Mykolaitis started singing and creating songs at school. After graduating he entered Music Academy of Lithuania in Vilnius. Initially he studied singing, but soon moved to acting.
From 1988 to 1992, Saulius Mykolaitis studied at the Music Academy of Lithuania under Professor Dalia Tamulevičiūtė and received Bachelors degree in Scene Art (Acting). In 1995 he decided to study for Masters degree and in 1996 acquired qualification as theatre director.
Mykolaitis committed suicide in 2006 in Vilnius, Lithuania.
Theatrical career.
From 1992 to 1994, Mykolaitis worked in Vilnius' National Mažasis (The Small) Theatre. From 1994 until the end of his life Saulius Mykolaitis was a member of Lithuanian National Drama Theatre and also collaborated with Oskaras Koršunovas Theatre.
Through the years Mykolaitis created over 20 roles. The most famous were Mercutio in K. Antanėlis' musical "Love and Death in Verona" (director Eimuntas Nekrošius), Roberto Zucco in Bernard-Marie Koltès' eponymous play (director Oskaras Koršunovas), Azzazelo in Mikhail Bulgakov's "The Master and Margarita" (director Oskaras Koršunovas), The Painter in Howard Barker's "Europeans" (director Lary Zappia).
Directed Plays.
Mykolaitis wasn't only performing in other directors' plays. He directed - and received renown for - several productions himself, the most important being (in which he also played leads), "Stop Machine" and "The City".
"Stop Machine" was based on Russian satirist's Daniil Charms' life and short stories, a performance that combined physical and psychological theatre.
"Once Petrushevsky broke his watch and asked to call Pushkin. Pushkin came, took a look at Petrushevsky's watch and put it back on the chair. "So what do you say, brother Pushkin?" - asked Petrushevsky. "Stop machine," - said Pushkin." (Anecdotes from the life of Pushkin)
Film and Music.
Aside from theatre, Mykolaitis had three supporting film roles. The last one was in "Dievų Miškas" (Forest of the Gods) (2005), a feature directed by Algimantas Puipa.
Saulius Mykolaitis also wrote and performed songs in the genre of sung poetry, playing the guitar. His first album "Nieko Nepasakyta" ("Nothing's Said") was released in autumn 2005. Posthumously his songs for children's plays were collected in an album called "Nupiešti Pasaulį" ("To Draw the World") (2006), followed by a compilation "Debesys" ("The Clouds") (2007), consisting of non-professional live recordings.

James Smetham

James Smetham (9 September 1821 – 5 February 1889) was an English Pre-Raphaelite painter and engraver, a follower of Dante Gabriel Rossetti.
Smetham was born in Pateley Bridge, Yorkshire, and attended school in Leeds; he was originally apprenticed to an architect before deciding on an artistic career. He studied at the Royal Academy, beginning in 1843. His modest early success as a portrait painter was stifled by the development of photography (a problem shared by other artists of the time). In 1851 Smetham took a teaching position at the Wesleyan Normal College in Westminster; in 1854 he married Sarah Goble, a fellow teacher at the school. They would eventually have six children. 
Smetham worked in a range of genres, including religious and literary themes as well as portraiture; but he is perhaps best known as a landscape painter. His "landscapes have a visionary quality" reminiscent of the work of William Blake, John Linnell, and Samuel Palmer. Out of a lifetime output of some 430 paintings and 50 etchings, woodcuts, and book illustrations, his 1856 painting "The Dream" is perhaps his best-known work but his signal work is "The Hymn of the Last Supper" a very ambitious subject for him to undertake but one which worked out magnificently. His choice of subject was sometimes somewhat bizarre; one of his best paintings is "The Death of Earl Siward" which depicts the dying earl, dressed in full armour, standing up and being supported by his servants as 'He did not wish to die lying down like a cow'.
He was also an essayist and art critic; an article on Blake (in the form of a review of Alexander Gilchrist's "Life of William Blake"), which appeared in the January 1869 issue of the "Quarterly Review", influenced and advanced recognition of Blake's artistic importance. Other Smetham articles for the "Review" were "Religious Art in England" (1861), "The Life and Times of Sir Joshua Reynolds" (1866), and "Alexander Smith" (1868). He also wrote some poetry.
Smetham was a devout Methodist, and after a mental breakdown in 1857, the second half of his life was marked by a growing religious mania and eventual insanity. "In one of his notebooks he attempted to illustrate every verse in the Bible." (Smetham habitually created miniature, postage-stamp-sized pen-and-ink drawings, in a process he called "squaring." He produced thousands of these in his lifetime.) He suffered a final breakdown in 1877 and lived in seclusion until his death.
Smetham's letters, posthumously published by his widow, throw light upon Rossetti, John Ruskin, and other contemporaries, and have been praised for their literary and spiritual qualities. His surviving journals and notebooks show that Smetham practiced an almost stream of consciousness type of writing that he called "ventilating," as a method of religious self-analysis. These writings delineate the depression that came to dominate Smetham's outlook.

Elek Benedek

Elek Benedek (or in Hungarian Benedek Elek) (30 September 1859 – 17 August 1929) was a Hungarian journalist and writer, more widely known as "the great folk-tale teller" of Hungarian fairy tales. 
Biography.
Born in Kisbacon, Transylvania (today Băţanii Mici, Romania), he studied in Székelyudvarhely (Romanian: Odorheiu Secuiesc) and later in Budapest. He went as a student with Job Sebesi to collect folklore elements. The result was a collection of Transylvanian tales, which was met with so much positive critique, that the young Elek Benedek cut short his studies. He worked at first as a journalist for "Budapest Hírlap" ("Budapest Newspaper") and for other newspapers.
He was a member of Parliament between 1887 and 1892. In his speeches he engaged in youth literature, folk poetry, folk language and public education.
In 1889 he founded, together with Lajos Pósa, the first Hungarian literary magazine for young people, "Az Én Újságom" ("My Magazine"). He was the editor of "Jó Pajtás" ("Good Fellow") with Zsigmond Sebők. He also edited a series of books for youth, called "Kis Könyvtár" ("Small Library"); this later appeared as "Benedek Elek Kis Könyvtára" ("Small Library of Benedek Elek"). In 1900 he joined the Kisfaludy Group, a group of famous Hungarian writers and poets. He also wrote poems, dramas, novels and historical fiction books, but the most famous were his fairy tales.
In 1885 the "Székely Tündérország" ("Szekler Fairy-land"), which contains the first original fairy tales from tha authors, appeared. Six years later, in 1891, the "Székely mesemondó" ("Szekler Storyteller") appeared. Benedek's biggest challenge was the "Magyar mese- és mondavilág" ("World of Hungarian Tales and Legends"), which appeared in 5 volumes between 1894 and 1896. This book was dedicated to the Hungarian Millenia.
Next to the original stories he made translations, including many tales from "Grimm's Fairy Tales" and "Arabian Nights" to Hungarian.
After the Treaty of Trianon (which transferred sovereignty over Transylvania to Romania), he went back to his native village, Kisbacon, where he edited the youth magazine "Cimbora" ("Friend") until he died.

The Secrets of Harry Bright (novel)

The Secrets of Harry Bright is the seventh novel written by former Los Angeles Police Department detective Joseph Wambaugh. Published in 1985, the book continues a pattern of Wambaugh crime fiction beginning with "The Choirboys" that uses black humor to explore the psychological effects of prolonged stress on veteran police officers. As with all his novels, "The Secrets of Harry Bright", set in November 1984, is contemporaneous with the time frame in which it was written and includes numerous allusions and references to events and personalities of the time.
"The Secrets of Harry Bright" also continued Wambaugh's satirization of the mores and extravagances of the Southern California "rich and famous" lifestyle that began with "The Black Marble", in addition to its focus on police work. The novel, set in and around Palm Springs, California, savages a wealthy "occasional home" mentality characterized by golf, excessive drinking and drug use, and discriminatory country clubs. Wambaugh draws contrasts by depicting the fictional Mineral Springs, a small wind-swept desert town populated not just by blue-collar tourist industry workers, but "ex-cons, bikers, crank dealers, Palm Springs burglars, nudists, robbers and pimps, horny kite pilots, dopers and drunks."
"The Secrets of Harry Bright" first appeared on the "New York Times" best seller list on October 6, 1985, ranked 15th, and rose as high as 5th. It spent a total of 17 weeks on the list.
Themes.
As with his other novels beginning with "The Black Marble", Wambaugh spins his tale from numerous points of view, but has as its central character and protagonist a competent, middle aged but dissipated detective sergeant whose age and police experience mirror that of Wambaugh himself, and where he likely would have been had he not resigned from the LAPD.
Wambaugh introduces a new psychological theme in "The Secrets of Harry Bright", that of the relationship of fathers and sons, exploring it as a sub-theme to those of burnout and police suicide that characterized his previous novels. He uses as a vehicle for this what he describes as the "unnatural perversion" of sons dying before their fathers, which has affected three key figures in his story. Although a murder whodunit, the plot is secondary to the gradual revelation of its central character, Sidney Blackpool. The title persona, Harry Bright, is seen only through the descriptions of others until the dénouement of the novel, when he becomes a crucial clue to Blackpool's fate.
Plot.
Paco Pedroza is chief of police in Mineral Springs, California, a small nondescript desert town near Palm Springs. The Los Angeles Police Department informs him that they have developed a new lead in a notorious, unsolved Palm Springs homicide in which the body was found in Solitaire Canyon, a notorious biker hangout within Mineral Springs. While Paco unenthusiastically prepares for a visit by an LAPD homicide team, desert rat drunkard Beavertail Bigelow, the object of a prank by one of Paco's cops, stumbles across an antique ukelele in the desert that will become a key piece of evidence in the renewed investigation.
On election day 1984 in Los Angeles, LAPD Sgt. Sidney Blackpool is invited to the corporate office of high tech industrialist Victor Watson, whose son Jack was the victim in the Palm Springs homicide. Over drinks, Watson tells Blackpool he pulled strings with LAPD to arrange for Blackpool to investigate a new lead that tenuously ties the case to Blackpool's jurisdiction in Hollywood. Blackpool suspects that the lead is a pretext to draw in the resources of LAPD after both Palm Springs and the Federal Bureau of Investigation failed to solve the case. Watson knows that Blackpool's son died at approximately the same time, and using that to engage his sympathies, persuades Blackpool to work the case as part of an expenses-paid golf vacation for himself and his partner, Otto Stringer, in Palm Springs. His inducement is a suggested promise of a retirement job for Blackpool as head of security for Watson Industries.
During the search for the missing Jack Watson, Officer O.A. Jones of Mineral Springs PD became lost in the desert, where he accidentally became a witness in the investigation, and in finding the lost O.A. Jones, other officers found the victim's body in a burned out car. While O.A. Jones tries to unravel his delerium recollections of a song he overhead being sung at the crime scene, other officers confiscate the ukelele, which Bigelow has sold to another desert rat, as the weapon used in a domestic violence case.
Blackpool and Stringer check into a posh Palm Springs hotel with $10,000 in $500 bills ("President McKinleys") as expense money. Their investigation starts slowly, as both are more interested in vacation amenities than work. After a visit to the Watson house, where they interview the live-in "houseboy", Harlan Penrod, and then a phone call to the Palm Springs PD, the investigation picks up speed as both conclude that a kidnapping was highly unlikely and try to figure out why Jack Watson would have gone to Solitaire Canyon.
Harlan provides a photo of Jack with a possible suspect. The investigation, with rounds of golf sandwiched in between, takes them to the Mineral Springs PD, the Eleven Ninety-nine Club (a cop bar in Mineral Springs), a gay bar in Palm Springs, a biker's shack in Solitaire Canyon, the Thunderbird Country Club, and a nursing home in Indio. The ukelele and the LAPD cops intersect at the cop bar, where Blackpool makes the connection linking it to O.A. Jones's memory. As suspects are investigated and eliminated as possibilities, Sidney Blackpool and Otto are forced to confront the possibility that either of two sergeants of the Mineral Springs PD, Harry Bright or Coy Brickman, might be Jack Watson's killer.
A tryst with Harry Bright's ex-wife provides the final clues for Sidney Blackpool, who confronts Paco Pedroza with his suspicions. After a heated confrontation, Pedroza agrees to cooperate in arranging ballistics tests of his officers' pistols but before that can take place, fate intervenes. Blackpool and Otto confront Coy Brickman, who reveals a hypothetical solution to the case to avoid implicating himself, tying off all loose ends raised by the investigation. Blackpool demands to see for himself proof of Harry Bright's invalid condition, which is far worse than he had considered. Afterwards, Otto washes his hands of the case and returns to Los Angeles without Sidney Blackpool, who takes the information to Victor Watson. When the interview shatters Blackpool, Sidney returns to Mineral Springs and finally discovers Harry Bright's secret.
Lampoons.
Wambaugh's novels are noted for numerous quirky but incidental characters, stereotypical lampoons of police officer "types" he either observed personally or the subjects of anecdotes related to him by officers. In "The Secrets of Harry Bright" the officers of the small, fictional Mineral Springs Police Department fill this role. The common thread linking them is their status as misfits elsewhere, and that all were recommended by Sgt. Harry Bright for hiring. Wambaugh expands his lampoons in "The Secrets of Harry Bright" to include two episodes depicting wealthy retired country clubbers, Archie Rosenkrantz and Fiona Grout, encountered by Blackpool and Stringer on golf courses.

Mixed martial arts clothing

MMA clothing refers to the sportswear worn in mixed martial arts (MMA) competition and training, and branded fashion clothing related to the mixed martial arts scene. As MMA becomes a mature sport, brands dedicated to it have worked toward specializing clothing that improve an MMA athlete's training and competition.
Overview.
MMA gloves and MMA shorts (similar to the shorts worn in boxing and Muay Thai) are the only piece of clothing allowed to be worn during professional MMA competitions. This type of clothing is often referred to as fightwear to differentiate it from MMA fashion clothing which includes t-shirts, hoodies, caps and hats. 
However, Amateur MMA, regulated by FILA, requires head guards, knee pads and shin-instep.
There are various types of MMA fightshorts, including board shorts, shorts which extend halfway down the thigh, shorts which extend only slightly down the thigh and gladiator shorts which feature slits in the sides of the legs. Common brands include Fifth Round Clothing, Bad Boy, Venum, TapouT, Sprawl, Silver Star, Hayabusa, TCB Fightwear, Jaco, POSS-MMA, Hitman Fight Gear, Dethrone Royalty and RYU.
Several clothing brands have developed their own lines of MMA apparel including Affliction Clothing, No Fear, Ecko Unlimited and Emerson Brand Apparel.
Mixed Martial Arts Shorts.
The Unified Rules of MMA provide clear guidelines around the shorts used during professional and amateur MMA bouts. These rules have provided a benchmark for apparel companies to design and develop training and competition shorts for mixed martial arts and related sports. MMA shorts have now evolved from regular board shorts or biking shorts. They now much more specialized and provide several features to improve comfort, range of motion and flexibility, and additional characteristics that improve a fighter's ability during practice and competition.
Mixed Martial Arts Shirts.
Most MMA fighters used specialized compression shirts, called Rash guards, to train. Rash guards are not regular compression shirts. Ground training techniques have required that these shirts provide reinforced seems and stitching, with additional panels to support the additional stress placed on the shirt during training while continuing to provide the benefits provided by regular compression shirts.
In addition to rash guards, several promotions like the UFC, regularly provide sponsors with the ability to advertise their brands using t-shirts during the weigh-in events and competition. These shirts have been title as "Walk-out" shirts by many, because they are used by a fighters while being presented for their fight as they walk towards the cage. These shirts are sold to the public as a means for the fans to support their favorite fighters.
Volume.
The overall revenues of sales of MMA clothing come to hundreds of millions of dollars a year, with both TapouT and Affliction recording sales in excess of $100 million.

Thompson Cooper

Thompson Cooper (8 January 1837, Cambridge – 5 March 1904, London) was an English journalist, man of letters, and compiler of reference works. He became a specialist in biographical information, and is noted as the most prolific contributor to the Victorian era "Dictionary of National Biography", for which he wrote 1423 entries.
Life.
Thompson Cooper was the son of Charles Henry Cooper, a Cambridge solicitor and antiquarian. Educated privately in Cambridge, Cooper was nominally articled to his father, and joined him in his antiquarian pursuits. He became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries aged 23, and at some point converted to Roman Catholicism.
As a young man, he was a parliamentary reporter, and developed an interest in shorthand. His "Parliamentary Short-Hand" was published in 1858. Cooper became sub-editor on the "Daily Telegraph" in 1861, and the paper's parliamentary reporter in 1862. In 1866 he began a long connection with "The Times": he was the paper's parliamentary reporter 1866-1886, its summary-writer for the House of Commons 1886-98, and from 1898 its summary-writer for the House of Lords.
Reference works.
With his father Charles Henry Cooper he compiled "Athenae Cantabrigienses", a biographical work covering alumni of the University of Cambridge.
The "Register and Magazine of Biography" (1869) was a short-lived periodical venture for John Gough Nichols, covering contemporary biography only, and lasting six months. "A New Biographical Dictionary" appeared in 1873, and was subsequently developed under various titles.
"Men of Mark: A Gallery of Contemporary Portraits" was a series of photographic portraits, accompanied by short biographies from Cooper. It was published from 1876 to 1883.
Cooper therefore brought considerable experience to the "DNB" when it launched in the 1880s. He played a general editorial role as "compiler of the lists of names to be treated under B and future letters", but his speciality as a contributor was "Roman Catholic divines and writers". He was also a prolific contributor to the Catholic Encyclopaedia. 
He was buried in Norwood Cemetery.

The 1928 Australian Grand Prix was a motor race held on the Phillip Island road course, on Phillip Island, Victoria, Australia on 31 March 1928. Although now known as the first Australian Grand Prix, the 1928 race was actually staged as the 100 Miles Road Race and it did not assume the Australian Grand Prix title until some years later.
The race was originally to be held on Monday 26 March however rain forced postponement until Saturday 31 March. It was open to "light" cars of up to 2 litre capacity and it attracted 30 entries, of which 17 started. The event was conducted as two separate races, with the first held in the morning for Class B (750cc to 1100cc) and D (1500cc to 2000cc) entries, and the second held in the afternoon, for Class A (up to 750cc) and C (1100cc to 1500cc) cars. The competitor setting the fastest time was to receive a £100 trophy donated by Mr CB Kellow and would be regarded as "Champion of the Day".

Headley Down

Headley Down is a village within the civil parish of Headley in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England surrounded on two sides by National Trust land. It is south west of London and 2.9 miles (4.6 km) east of Bordon. Nearby are the villages of Grayshott and Churt.
History.
The area was called Headley Down on maps as early as 1801, and from about the 1870s houses began to be built by people wishing to live or holiday in the healthy environment for which the Hindhead area was notable. It was also described as Headley Common on a map (of about 1868) of the large Wishanger Manor Estate.
The side-roads in Headley Down were laid out in a grid system at least as early as 1909, rather than radiating out from a central point such as a church.
The Land of Nod estate predates Headley Down, possibly established in the early 18th century; an owner of the estate believed its name derived from an earlier incumbent by the name of Cane or Keyne, an excommunicant, and is a reference to the biblical story of Cain's banishment. The estate lies mainly to the north of the village. Kelly's Directory of 1895 lists J Henry Christian as a private resident of the Land of Nod.
Headley Down was formally named in March 1923 when the Post Office proclaimed that "the official name of the Telephone Call Office which has been established on Stone Hill will be Headley Down". A Post Office was built in the 1960s in Carlton Road and remained open until it was incorporated into Whittle's store (now Londis) in Eddeys Lane.
During the Second World War the area was home to several camps for Canadian soldiers. Headley Down's camp was a military detention centre named Erie, and was built on the Land of Nod estate owned by Major L Whitaker. Erie Camp was designated by the War Office as a "Military Prison and Detention Barracks" from at least 1946 to 1948. The camp was subsequently demolished.
From early April 1944, 107 Regiment (King's Own) Royal Armoured Corps trained with Churchill tanks on Headley Down in preparation for the invasion of Normandy.
In the 1950s Alfred Whittle opened a general store, butcher's and coal merchant in Eddeys Lane to accommodate Headley Down's increasing post-war population.
"Penryn" was a home for children, mainly from London, in the post-war period until the 1980s when it was replaced by private housing, now called Penryn Drive.
Most side-roads in Headley Down remained unpaved until the 1960s when there was a considerable increase in permanent housing in addition to replacing or upgrading the numerous temporary holiday homes.
In the 1970s, 350 community housing homes were built on the site of the former Erie Camp and named Heatherlands. The estate houses approximately one fifth of the Headley parish population. In 2006 Heatherlands/Headley Down was considered to be the most deprived ward in East Hampshire, and East Hampshire District Council expressed the view that Headley's Parish Plan was not sufficiently inclusive of the whole parish. The Parish Council set out to explore ways to improve social inclusion and in 2007 produced a report with recommendations for action.
Amenities.
Transport.
The main through road is the B3002 (Beech Hill/Grayshott Road) connecting Headley Down to the A333 (the old A3) at Hindhead via Grayshott to the east, and to the A325 at Bordon, via Headley and Lindford to the west.
The nearest railway station is 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the village, at Liphook.
The bus route serving Headley Down is Stagecoach 18 that runs between Aldershot and Haslemere (via Farnham and Bordon).
Education.
There is no school in Headley Down; the nearest for up to 11 year olds is The Holme Church of England Controlled Primary School in Headley village.
Environment.
Ludshott Common, adjoining the eastern and southern boundary of the village, is one of the largest remaining areas of heathland in East Hampshire. It covers 285 ha (705 acres) and is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Protection Area (SPA) due to the number of endangered species, including woodlark, nightjar and Dartford warbler. There are also a great variety of spider and butterfly species, including the silver-studded blue, grayling and green hairstreak.
Pond Road is so named for a pond that existed up until the 1970s when it was drained and subsequently attracted fly-tipping. Local residents remembered it had previously contained fish and attracted kingfishers. With the aid of local and county council grants it was re-established in 2003 and is now known as Fuller's Vale Wildlife Pond.

National Highway 58 (India)

National Highway 58 (NH 58) is a national highway in India. It links Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh near New Delhi with Badrinath and Mana Pass in Uttarakhand near Indo-Tibet border. This highway starts from Mana village near Indo-Tibet border north of Badrinath temple and passes through Badrinath, Joshimath, Chamoli, Vishnuprayag, Nandaprayag, Karnaprayag, Rudraprayag, Srinagar, Devprayag, Rishikesh, Haridwar, Roorkee, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Modinagar and ends at Ghaziabad near the border with Delhi.
Of its total length, the NH 58 traverses in Uttar Pradesh and in Uttarakhand.
The highway is constructed and maintained by National Highway Authority of India from Delhi to Rishikesh and Border Roads Organisation (BRO) of Indian Army from Rishikesh, where the plains end and the mountains start, to its northernmost end. The highway bypasses Meerut city that was a big bottleneck. Bypasses at Roorkee and Muzaffarnagar are being constructed. However no bypass is planned for Modinagar that remains a big bottleneck.
Importance of NH58.
Religious.
It is an important route for Hindu pilgrims as it connects the national capital New Delhi with religious pilgrim centres, Haridwar and Rishikesh in the plains of Uttarakhand, and then with the hill cities and temples of Uttarakhand. The most important pilgrimage circuit in Uttarakhand is called Chhota Char Dham (Four Pilgrimage Centres) comprising Yamunotri (where Yamuna river originates), Gangotri (where Ganga river originates), Kedarnath temple and Badrinath temple. The pilgrims visit Haridwar and Rishikesh in the plains the entire year but more so during the winter. The pilgrim season in the hills starts with melting of the snow at the end of April or in the beginning of May and continues until the onset of monsoon rains in late June. Buses and vehicles packed with pilgrims and tourists throng the highway during the summer months.
The highway is packed with pilgrims and tourists during pilgrimage season or during important festivals. When pilgrims bring holy water from Ganga river and carry it to their villages and homes walking on foot all the way during one fortnight, one lane of the highway is reserved for these pilgrims who walk on foot and vehicles have to use only one lane for about two weeks in a year.
Strategic and military.
The highway connects with the border with Tibet. It is built and maintained by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) of Indian Army from Rishikesh, where the plains end and the mountains start, to its northernmost end. Earlier it was built only up to Chamoli and has over the years gradually been extended to Joshimath, Badrinath and finally to Mana Pass near the border with Tibet. The army is one of its major users.
Development.
As of December 2013, the Meerut to Muzzaffarnagar stretch is 4-laned on toll basis including bypasses at Khatauli and Muzaffarnagar. The Muzaffarnagar to Haridwar stretch has been awarded for similar development with scheduled completion by February 2013, but has been delayed due to problems such as land acquisition, tree felling and inadequate mobilization by the Concessionaire. Also, a flyover at Mohan Nagar, a 4710 m long viaduct at Modinagar and a 1710 m long viaduct at Murad Nagar are proposed.

<doc id="19712939" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19712939" title="G.718">
G.718

G.718 is an ITU-T recommendation embedded scalable speech and audio codec providing high quality narrowband (250 Hz to 3.5 kHz) speech over the lower bit rates and high quality wideband (50 Hz to 7 kHz) speech over the complete range of bit rates. In addition, G.718 is designed to be highly robust to frame erasures, thereby enhancing the speech quality when used in internet protocol (IP) transport applications on fixed, wireless and mobile networks. Despite its embedded nature, the codec also performs well with both narrowband and wideband generic audio signals.
The codec has an embedded scalable structure, enabling maximum flexibility in the transport of voice packets through IP networks of today and in future media-aware networks. In addition, the embedded structure of G.718 will easily allow the codec to be extended to provide a superwideband (50 Hz to 14 kHz) and stereo capability through additional layers which are currently under development in ITU-T Study Group 16. The bitstream may be truncated at the decoder side or by any component of the communication system to instantaneously adjust the bit rate to the desired value without the need for out-of-band signalling. The encoder produces an embedded bitstream structured in five layers corresponding to the five available bit rates: 8, 12, 16, 24 & 32 kbit/s. 
The G.718 encoder can accept wideband sampled signals at 16 kHz, or narrowband signals sampled at either 16 or 8 kHz. Similarly, the decoder output can be 16 kHz wideband, in addition to 16 or 8 kHz narrowband. Input signals sampled at 16 kHz, but with bandwidth limited to narrowband, are detected by the encoder.
The output of the G.718 codec is capable of operating with a bandwidth of 50 Hz to 4 kHz at 8 and 12 kbit/s and 50 Hz to 7 kHz from 8 to 32 kbit/s. 
The high quality codec core represents a significant advance in quality over currently available codecs, providing 8 kbit/s wideband clean speech quality equivalent to G.722.2 at 12.65 kbit/s whilst the 8 kbit/s narrowband codec operating mode provides clean speech quality equivalent to G.729 Annex E at 11.8 kbit/s.
The codec operates on 20 ms frames and has a maximum algorithmic delay of 42.875 ms for wideband input and wideband output signals. The maximum algorithmic delay for narrowband input and narrowband output signals is 43.875 ms. The codec may also be employed in a low-delay mode when the encoder and decoder maximum bit rates are set to 12 kbit/s. In this case the maximum algorithmic delay is reduced by 10 ms.
The codec also incorporates an alternate coding mode, with a minimum bit rate of 12.65 kbit/s, which is bitstream interoperable with ITU-T Recommendation G.722.2, 3GPP AMR-WB and 3GPP2 VMR-WB mobile wideband speech coding standards. This option replaces Layer 1 and Layer 2, and the layers 3-5 are similar to the default option with the exception that in Layer 3 few bits are used to compensate for the extra bits of the 12.65 kbit/s core. The decoder is further able to decode all other G.722.2 operating modes. G.718 also includes discontinuous transmission mode (DTX) and comfort noise generation (CNG) algorithms that enable bandwidth savings during inactive periods. An integrated noise reduction algorithm can be used provided that the communication session is limited to 12 kbit/s.
The underlying algorithm is based on a two-stage coding structure: the lower two layers are based on Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) coding of the band (50–6400 Hz) where the core layer takes advantage of signal-classification to use optimized coding modes for each frame. The higher layers encode the weighted error signal from the lower layers using overlap-add modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) transform coding. Several technologies are used to encode the MDCT coefficients to maximize performance for both speech and music.
G.718 was developed in ITU-T Study Group 16 as part of an open consortium of 9 organizations; Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson, Texas Instruments, VoiceAge Corporation, Panasonic, Huawei, France Telecom, Qualcomm.
G.718 is officially described as "Frame error robust narrowband and wideband embedded variable bit-rate coding of speech and audio from 8-32 kbit/s".

Aleksandrs Dibrivnijs

Aleksandrs Dibrivnijs (born 28 August 1969 in Jēkabpils) is a former Latvia international footballer, a four-time champion of Latvia.
In his very first senior season in 1987 Dibrivnijs won the Latvian Cup with VEF Rīga. In the cup final against Torpedo Rīga Dibrivnijs came on as a substitute and scored the winning penalty in the aftermatch penalty shootout. Dibrivnijs spent two years with VEF but in 1988–1989 he had to start his military service in the Soviet Army. During the first months in the army Dibrivnijs still was allowed to play football with VEF, then he was assigned to play with RAF Jelgava, however as he didn't make the first-squad selection of RAF, he mostly played with Junioru izlase. After Dibrivnijs had expressed an interest in joining FC Baltika Kaliningrad, Dibrivnijs was sent to continue his service far from Latvia – in Irkutsk. There he played football with the local army squad and attracted interest from the management of FC Zvezda Irkutsk. He participated in some trainings with the club but wasn't allowed to play for it.
After completing his military service and returning to Riga Dibrivnijs received transfer papers for joining Zvezda Irkutsk, but he stayed in Riga and joined Pārdaugava Riga which was then coached by Jānis Gilis. In 1991 Dibrivnijs joined Skonto Riga for which he played until the summer of 1994, winning the Latvian Higher League all these four years. In 1993 Dibrivnijs played his single official match for Latvia national football team as it beat Estonia national football team to win the Baltic Cup.
In the middle of the 1994 season Dibrivnijs left Skonto, as after an injury he got very little playing practice. He joined Olimpija Rīga which had won the silver medals of the Latvian league the previous year but was already on a decline in 1994 and in 1995 finished in the 9th place in the Latvian League and went bankrupt. After that Dibrivnijs spent one year Skonto/Metāls. In his last season in the Latvian Higher League in 1997 Dibrivnijs played with Daugava Rīga which under the management of Jurijs Popkovs won the silver medals of Virslīga.
After leaving FC Daugava Dibrivnijs continued playing football with several Latvian First League clubs, however his preferences switched to futsal in which he also represented the Latvia national team, and in later years also took up coaching. As of October 2008 he is the playing head coach of the strongest Latvian futsal club – Nikars Rīga.
