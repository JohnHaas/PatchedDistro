Myitnge River

Myitnge River ( or Dokhtawaddy River () is a major tributary of Ayeyarwady River (Irrawaddy) in Myanmar (Burma). The name Myitnge in Burmese and Dokhtawaddy in Pali both mean "little river" in comparison with the Ayeyarwady or "big river".
Source, course and outflow.
It has its source in Yunnan province of China, courses down northern Shan Plateau of eastern Burma where it is known as Namtu River, and it flows into the Ayeyarwady at Innwa (Ava). The old capital of the kingdom of Ava was built between its two branches, Myittha River which it gives off to the west and the eastern stream which retains the name Myitnge before it enters the Irrawaddy.
History.
The famous Shwe Sar Yan Pagoda on its north bank, built in 1053 by the Shan princess Sao Mon Hla on her journey home after wedding and later leaving King Anawrahta (1044–1077) of Bagan in central Burma, holds its annual festival starting just before the full moon of Tabaung (March). Anawrahta constructed an irrigation system consisting of weirs and canals on the Panlaung and the Zawgyi rivers but found the Myitnge too wild to tame. Three centuries later Thadominbya (1364-8) built Ava as his capital at the confluence of Myitnge and Ayeyarwady rivers within easy reach of the rice granary at Kyaukse.
Bridges.
During the Second World War starting from New Year Day 1943 through to late April, several bombing raids were carried out by B-25s and B-24s of the USAAF to destroy the bridge over the Myitnge River carrying the main railway line from Mandalay to Rangoon. They returned the following December to bomb the bridge and the rail yards at nearby Paleik. Two years later it was the turn of the RAF Thunderbolts to attack the bridge.
Myitnge River is today spanned by a new bridge, 700 feet long and 27 feet wide for motor traffic flanked on each side by a footpath 6 feet wide, and was opened in 1999.
Dams.
A 790 megawatt hydroelectric power plant called Yeywa Dam Project, with assistance from China, is under way on the Myitnge River southeast of Mandalay.

Hurricane Rosa (1994)

Hurricane Rosa was the only Pacific hurricane to make landfall during the above-average 1994 Pacific hurricane season. It killed at least 4 people in Mexico. Moisture from the hurricane was a factor in widespread flooding in the U.S. state of Texas that killed 22 people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage in October 1994. The pre-Rosa tropical depression formed on October 8 before degenerating the next day. It reformed on October 10 and steadily strengthened as it approached Mexico. Ultimately peaking as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale right before landfall, Rosa was the final hurricane, nineteenth tropical storm, and second-last tropical cyclone of the 1994 Pacific hurricane season.
Meteorological history.
On October 8, a circulation associated with an area of disturbed weather acquired convection and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen-E. Upon formation, the depression was forecast to dissipate because of strong wind shear. Moving little, its development was constantly hindered by wind shear. The depression had difficulty organizing, and on October 9, it became so disorganized that advisories were discontinued.
The depression's remnants moved eastward and interacted with an area of disturbed weather. This regenerated the convection, and the depression regenerated on October 10, possibly with a new center of circulation. However, the National Hurricane Center's preliminary report does not indicate that the depression ever dissipated or regenerated. Moving little in a favorable environment, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Rosa on October 11, and to hurricane status a day later. At the time it was about south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Rosa continued drifting slowly for another day and a half. Then, a trough caused Rosa to begin moving and accelerate north-northeastward. On October 14, Rosa peaked in intensity as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of and a central pressure of . A few hours later, Rosa made landfall near La Concepción about south-southeast of Mazatlán. Rosa's circulation weakened over the mountains, and it dissipated on October 15.
Preparations, impact, and aftermath.
On October 12, a hurricane watch was issued for the coast from Culiacán to Manzanillo and the Baja California Peninsula south of latitude 24°N. At the same time, a tropical storm warning was issued from Manzanillo to Tepic. On October 14, a hurricane warning was issued for the coast between Culiacán and Cabo Corrientes, and a tropical storm warning south of Cabo Corrientes to Manzanillo. All watches and warnings were lifted later that day.
On October 13 and 14, two ships, the "London Spirit" and the "Marie Maersk", encountered winds of tropical storm or hurricane force. The "Marie Maersk" was located especially close to the eye, and its observations were useful to forecasters.
In Nayarit and Durango, two people drowned, while in Sinaloa, four people were pronounced missing. More than 100,000 people in Nayarit had their homes damaged. Rosa's winds damaged many telephone poles, power lines, and houses in Sinaloa. Rainfall between caused many landslides in mountainous areas. Mudslides forced the evacuation of 400 people from two coastal villages in Jalisco. Rosa dumped rain over parts of coastal and inland Mexico; the highest rainfall total was at Mesa de Pedro Pablo.
Rosa sent moisture into the United States, which, in combination with humidity drawn north from the Gulf of Mexico, caused heavy thunderstorms and flooding in parts of thirty eight Texas counties on October 15 to 19. The flooding was worst around the San Jacinto and Trinity River basins, and in coastal areas. Rainfall totals ranged from to more than . The rain levels caused 100-year floods at nineteen stations. Several records were broken, some of which had stood since 1940. In the case of the Lavaca River near Edna, it broke a record set in 1936. The flooding destroyed 3069 homes, heavily damaged 6560, and damaged 6148 others. Railbeds and roads sustained damage, while broken gas and oil pipelines caused spills and environmental damage in the Lower San Jacinto River and Galveston Bay. Twenty-two people died due to effects from the storm. In total, the flooding in southeastern Texas caused 700 million (1995 USD) in damage. On October 18, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declared the worst-affected areas a disaster area. After the declaration, FEMA received 26,000 applications for disaster assistance and approved 54 million (1995 USD) in aid.

A game of "Alteil" usually lasts between fifteen and twenty minutes. Since the internet allows players to use virtual gameplay techniques, players are able to do things which they couldn't do using physical cards. For instance, players can have the same card from their deck in multiple files (files are groupings of cards that are used in a match), choose cards to use from the entire deck rather than drawing cards from the deck and using them a hand, and complex mathematics can be implemented without disrupting the pace of the game. Players in the game are referred to as .

Hay and Hell and Booligal

Hay and Hell and Booligal is a poem by the Australian bush poet Banjo Paterson. Paterson wrote the poem while working as a solicitor with the firm of Street & Paterson in Sydney. It was first published in "The Bulletin" on 25 April 1896. The poem was later included in Paterson's collection "Rio Grande's Last Race and Other Verses", first published in 1902.
The poem is about the western Riverina town of Booligal; then and now a remote, isolated locality. It compares Booligal unfavourably with the nearby town of Hay and even Hell, recounting a litany of problems with the town—heat, sand, dust, flies, rabbits, mosquitos, snakes and drought—with humorous intent. "Hell" may also refer to a nearby property called "Hell's Gate". The Oxford Literary Guide to Australia places "Hell" at nearby One Tree, on the stock route between Hay on the Murrumbidgee River and Booligal on the Lachlan River.
The poem concludes with the lines: 
Booligal was indeed the victim of many natural disasters around this time. As well as the usual droughts and floods, in 1890 the town was victim to a rabbit plague. Despite poisoning and "drives" killing hundreds and thousands of rabbits, the pasture was severely depleted. This was quickly followed by another plague; this time of grasshoppers who ate everything that grew, including the produce in the Chinese gardens. Nevertheless, the description of the town was not popular with Booligal residents:
The phrase "Hay and Hell and Booligal" or its variant "Hay, Hell and Booligal" has become part of Australian folklore. In 1897, one year after the poems' publication "The Age" in Melbourne reported:
The author and folklorist Bill Wannan titled his collection of Australian bush humour "Hay, Hell and Booligal".

<doc id="19563261" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19563261" title="Syriac versions of the Bible">
Syriac versions of the Bible

Syria played an important or even predominant role in the beginning of Christianity. Here is where the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of Luke, the Didache, Ignatiana, and the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas were written. Syria was the country in which the Greek language intersected with the Syriac, which was closely related to the Aramaic dialect used by Jesus and the Apostles. That is why Syriac versions are highly esteemed by textual critics.
Scholars have distinguished five or six different Syriac versions of all or part of the New Testament. It is possible that some translations have been lost. The majority of the manuscripts are now held in the British Library and in other European libraries. They came from countries like Lebanon, Egypt, Sinai, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Georgia, India, and even from China. This is good evidence for the great historical activity of the Syriac church.
Diatessaron.
This is the earliest translation of the gospels into Syriac. Syriac is a Greek word for the language spoken by the Syrians. It was an Aramaic dialect spoken in Syria. The earliest translation of any New Testament text from Greek seems to have been the Diatessaron, a harmony of the four canonical gospels (perhaps with a non-extant fifth text) prepared about AD 170 by Tatian in Rome. Although no text of the Diatessaron survives, its foremost witness is a prose commentary on it by Ephrem the Syrian. Although there are many so-called manuscript witnesses to the Diatessaron, they all differ, and, ultimately only witness to the enduring popularity of such harmonies. Many medieval European harmonies draw on the Codex Fuldensis.
The Old Syriac version.
The Old Syriac version of the four Gospels is preserved today in only two manuscripts, both with a large number of gaps.
The Curetonian Gospels consist of fragments of the four Gospels. The text was brought in 1842 from the Nitrian Desert in Egypt, and is now held in the British Library. These fragments were examined by William Cureton and edited by him in 1858. The manuscript is dated paleographically to the 5th century. It is called Curetonian Syriac, and designated by Syrc.
The second manuscript is a palimpsest discovered by Agnes Smith Lewis in the Saint Catherine's Monastery in 1892 at Mount Sinai, called Sinaitic Syriac, and designated by Syrs. This version was known and cited by Ephrem the Syrian, thus suggesting a date of composition at the end of the 2nd century. It is a representative of the Western text-type.
These two manuscripts represent only Gospels. The text of Acts and the Pauline Epistles has not survived to the present. It is known only from citations made by Eastern fathers. The text of Acts was reconstructed by F. C. Conybeare, and the text of the Pauline Epistles by J. Molitor. They used Ephrem's commentaries.
In early February 2009, a third book was found in the possession of suspected antiquities smugglers in northern Cyprus. It appears to be a Syriac Bible dating from about 2000 years ago. The manuscript contains Bible excerpts written on vellum in gold lettering. One page has a drawing of a tree, and another eight lines of Syriac script. It was loosely strung together. Experts are divided over this manuscript, and whether it is an original or a fake.
Peshitta.
The term Peshitta was used by Moses bar Kepha in 903 and means "simple" (in analogy to the Latin Vulgate). It is the oldest Syriac version which has survived to the present day in its entirety. 
It contains the entire Old Testament, most (?) of the apocryphal books, as well as 22 books of the New Testament, lacking the shorter General epistles (2-3 John, 2 Peter, Jude, as well as John 7:53-8:11). 
It was made in the beginning of the 5th century. Its authorship was ascribed to Rabbula, bishop of Edessa (411-435). The Syriac church still uses it to the present day.
More than 350 manuscripts survived, several of which date from the 5th and 6th centuries.
In the Gospels it is closer to the Byzantine text-type, but in Acts to the Western text-type. It is designated by Syrp.
The earliest manuscript of the Peshitta is a "Pentateuch" dated AD 464. There are two New Testament manuscripts of the 5th century (Codex Phillipps 1388).
Later Syriac versions.
The Philoxenian was probably produced in 508 for Philoxenus, Bishop of Mabbug in eastern Syria. This translation contains the five books not found in the Peshitta: 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and the Apocalypse. This translation survived only in short fragments. It is designated by syrph. Harclensis is designated by syrh. It is represented by some 35 manuscripts dating from the 7th century and later; they show kinship with the Western text-type.
According to some scholars the Philoxenian and Harclensis are only recensions of Peshitta, but according to others they are independent new translations.
About AD 500 a Palestinian Syriac version in was made the Palestinian dialect. It contains 2 Peter, 2-3 John, Jude, and Apocalypse. It is a representative of the Caesarean text-type and is a unique translation different from any other which was made into Syriac. These are among the manuscripts used by John Gwynn in 1893 to complete his edition of the Catholic Epistles. 
In 1892 Agnes Smith Lewis discovered the manuscript of the Palestinian Syriac lectionary in the library of Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai. It is designated by Syrpal.

Lioré et Olivier LeO H-47

__NOTOC__
The Lioré et Olivier LeO H-47 was a flying boat airliner built in France in 1936. It was designed to operate passenger services over the South Atlantic, but the outbreak of the Second World War caused the type to be used by the French Navy as a maritime patrol aircraft.
Development and design.
In 1934, the French air ministry issued a specification for a long-range flying boat to be used by Air France to operate services over the South Atlantic between Dakar in Senegal and Natal in Brazil. As such, the specification required that the new transport be capable of flying at a speed of 250 km/h (155 mph) while carrying a payload of 1,000 kilogrammes (2,200 lb). Lioré et Olivier received an order for a prototype of its design to meet this specification, the LeO H-47 on 10 August 1935.
The H-47 was a conventional, high-wing design with the cabin and flight deck fully enclosed within a streamlined hull. The four engines were mounted in two tractor-pusher pairs on the upper wing.
The prototype H-47 first flew from Antibes on 25 July 1936, and was destroyed in a crash in May 1937 that was attributed to a wingtip float breaking away whilst the aircraft was in flight. Nevertheless, Air France went ahead with the purchase of five similar (though strengthened) machines, designated H-470, which were put into service as mail planes. These machines were impressed into the French Navy at the outbreak of the Second World War.
The four remaining aircraft remained in use with the Vichy French Navy following the French Armistice, being used for transport between France and Tunisia, before being transferred to Dakar in Senegal in June 1941. The last H-470 was scrapped in August 1943 when stocks of spares ran out.

The King Blues

The King Blues were a ukulele punk rock band from London, England, credited for fusing ska and folk together with influences from punk rock and hardcore punk. Tariq Ali described the band's sounds as 'rough, radical music that should unsettle the rulers of this country. A new generation of musicians are challenging war-monger politicians and their courtiers'. Influences include Public Enemy, The Clash, The Specials, Black Flag and Minor Threat. Their third full length album, "Punk and Poetry", was released on 17 April 2011. Lead singer Jonny 'Itch' Fox describes the music as 'a mixture of reggae, hip hop, folk, doo wop, punk rock.' 
They announced their breakup on the 3rd of April, 2012.
History.
The King Blues began as a two man ska outfit, consisting of Jonny 'Itch' Fox on vocals and ukulele and Jamie Jazz on acoustic guitar and additional vocals. The band later expanded to include a second acoustic guitarist and bassist, before again expanding to include two full-time percussion members. Their sound was initially described as "soulful ska with raw folk and a punk rock attitude". or "conscious rude boy ska"
In 2004, they self-released a demo EP titled "All Fall Down" featuring 5 tracks recorded by Itch on guitar and vocals. The cover and CD body art was a stencil of a fuse bomb and the band's logo; each one was hand sprayed.
"Under The Fog" (2006/07).
In June 2006 their debut album, "Under the Fog", was released on Household Name Records, and coincided with increased gigging. In November of the same year, "Mr Music Man" was released as a CD single, also on Household Name. The single was enhanced with a video chronicling the band's attempt to play more gigs in a 24-hour period than Status Quo's record-breaking four gigs in one day. The King Blues managed seven. Their single "Mr Music Man" was voted Best Punk Song of 2006 by BBC Radio 1.
A 12" vinyl version of Under The Fog was released on Tartan Records [http://www.tartanrex.co.uk] in 2007. Limited to 1000 copies with the added bonus track of "If Genghis Khan, then Why Can't I", the vinyl was a hefty 180gms and hand printed. In true punk rock spirit the vinyl was split equally with the band and label. 
In 2007, the band was signed to Field Recordings, a label co-owned by Rollo Armstrong and backed by Island Records. "Under the Fog" was partly re-recorded and re-issued in March 2008, and was preceded by two singles, "Come Fi Di Youth" and a new version of "Mr. Music Man".
In 2007, Johnny 'Itch' Fox provided additional vocals for And Now We're Even's first single "Youmii, Hawaii".
"Save The World, Get The Girl" (2008).
In May 2008, the band released a single from their forthcoming second album called "Let's Hang the Landlord" to those signed up to their email list. The lyric is autobiographical, detailing Itch's life as a teenage punk. The track was also released on a split 7" single, alongside "Mayday", the debut UK single by Flobots.
Save the World. Get the Girl was released on October 20, 2008 in the UK. The album was produced by Peter Miles, who produced "Under the Fog", and Clive Langer (producer of Elvis Costello, Madness, Dexy's Midnight Runners, Morrissey, Teardrop Explodes, Bush and The Holloways). The album received positive reviews.
"My Boulder" was released as a single on October 13, 2008 in the UK. Zane Lowe played this track several times on BBC Radio 1 and recommended it on air to Noel Gallagher. "My Boulder" includes an excerpt from a reading of the poem "The Pied Piper of Hamlyn" by Robert Browning. Other tracks from the album, including What If Punk Never Happened, received airplay on Radio 1, from Rob da Bank, Mike Davies, and Zane Lowe, and on the Xfm punk show ("X Punk") hosted by Pete Donaldson and Phil Clifton.[http://xfm.co.uk/punk]
The band have also received considerable airplay in Australia courtesy of Triple R's punk program "Bullying the Jukebox".
"I Got Love" was released on 4 May 2009 as the final single from the album; its first air-time was on BBC Radio 1. The band also performed a cover of Dizzee Rascal's "Bonkers" on Radio 1's "Live Lounge" in June 2009.
Post "Save the World, Get the Girl" (2009/10).
Over late 2009 and early 2010, The King Blues continued to tour their second album, adding new songs such as "Headbutt", "Sore Throat" and "Five Bottles of Shampoo" to their setlist.
In mid 2010, The King Blues were dropped from Field Recordings. This coincided with the departure of band members Fruitbag, Johnny Rich, Al Gunby and Jim Parmley. A controversial message explaining the departures was posted on the Punktastic forum by Fruitbag. However, the band quickly found a new record label, Transmission Recordings, and new members. Only a few weeks later, the new King Blues line-up went on tour supporting Enter Shikari.
On 23 March, Zane Lowe aired a new single, "Headbutt", as his "hottest record in the world" on his Radio 1 show, and Itch stated on the show that the band had completely finished recording 5 or 6 new songs. On their UK tour it was announced that "Headbutt" would be released on 16 May 2010 and that Rou Reynolds of Enter Shikari had remixed the track for free download. 
The King Blues departed on their "London Brawling tour" (10 April until 5 May) along with four different support bands: Mouthwash (all gigs), Moral Dilemma, The Meow Meows and Dirty Revolution. Most nights of the tour the band invited a speaker on stage, including Sophie Lancaster's mum speaking for the S.O.P.H.I.E. foundation. (The King Blues had S.O.P.H.I.E. bands available on this tour.) The band also played gigs for Love Music Hate Racism. On August 8, 2010 they played at the Hevy Music Festival near Folkestone. During this time, the band showcased new songs planned for the forthcoming album "Punk & Poetry". However, much of this material, such as "Kissing Frogs" and "We Will Never Grow Old" was shelved due to the band finding new inspiration from the UK's anti-cuts protests and riots, and the Arab Spring, which led to them writing new material such as "I Want You", "We Are Fucking Angry" and "Set The World On Fire".
On 29 August, The King Blues released their new single "Holiday" along with "I Got Hate" and an acoustic version of the previous single "Headbutt" as B-sides. On the same day, the King Blues played the main stage at Reading Festival.
"Punk & Poetry" (2011).
On 21 January 2011, The King Blues posted a 40 second preview of a new song, "We Are Fucking Angry". It received radio play on Mike Davies' Radio 1 Punk Show and a few days later the band posted a free download link to the song on the internet.
"Set The World On Fire" debuted on Mike Davies' Punk Show on 7 February, receiving more plays on the same show and Zane Lowe's show over the next few weeks. On 26 February, the official music video for the song was posted online. It was released on the 10 April on digital download with a Dr Meaker remix version of the song as the b-side. On 1 March, Itch co-hosted Mike Davies' Radio 1 Punk Show, previewing new songs "The Future's Not What It Used To Be" and "Five Bottles of Shampoo". On 5 March, the track-listing for "Punk and Poetry" was announced, and the album was released on 18 April to further positive reviews. It reached the Top 40 of the UK Album Chart, just missing the Top 30.
The band sent a copy of "Set the World On Fire" to the Daily Mail, who responded by pulling every article, webpage and reference to The King Blues from everything they own. In rebuttal to this the music video for "Set the World On Fire" has vocalist Itch burning a copy of the Daily Mail. 
On 12 February 2012, the fourth single from the current album, "Does Anybody Care About Us?" was released as a digital download, backed with a live recording of "Five Bottles of Shampoo".
"Long Live The Struggle" (2012).
At the 2011 Leeds Festival, The King Blues announced the commencement of work on the follow up album to "Punk & Poetry", and debuted new song "Power to the People", which was also played on their subsequent debut European tour. At The Roundhouse in November 2011 they debuted another new song "Modern Life Has Let Me Down". 
On 6 March 2012, Itch again co-hosted Mike Davies' Radio 1 Punk Show, previewing new song "Tear Us Apart".
In a review in Stencil Magazine, the artwork and tracklisting was revealed.
Tracklisting is as follows:
Politics.
The King Blues have "a commitment to politics and resistance". Itch has written for "Last Hours" magazine which generally focuses on resistance politics and protest. Several songs on "Under the Fog" are overtly political, including "Chimp in a 3 Piece Suit" and "Duck and Cover". The band's website states that "Save the World, Get the Girl" features "a much more personalized take on social ills" than "Under the Fog". Nonetheless, overtly political lyrics did feature in two live favourites that appeared on the album. The title track includes the lyric "Going to war to prevent war was the most stupid thing I ever heard", while "The Streets Are Ours" includes references to Indymedia and Tiananmen Square. "Smash EDO Dub", the B side to the re-release of "Mr. Music Man", features an interview with a campaigner from the Smash EDO movement. The links on The King Blues' official website are almost exclusively political. On his Formspring profile, Itch states that he is probably an anarchist.
Promoting their latest single in February 2012, Itch made the following statement: "There's no fucking future for anyone but the privileged anymore, education needs to be for everyone, we need jobs, houses, and all they want us to do is pay our taxes, shut the fuck up and gratefully eat X-Factor. It makes me sick to my gut. Banker bonuses and politicians claiming thousands for their fucking duck ponds while they sweep the homeless off the streets and hose down where they're sleeping, taking away benefits while two and a half million people are unemployed, leaving empty houses to rot and trying to outlaw squatting during a homeless crisis.
There's a battle going on and we're part of it whether we like it or not. Cameron says, 'in this together', easy to say if you're sitting on £30,000,000! He has no idea what life is like for the people he condemns, for the people he makes it most difficult for. He's a fucking scumbag and I've had enough of it, I know I ain't the only one either. I look around and I see resistance on every level. Call us what you like, striking workers, protesting students, rioting kids, the 99%, we are who we are, a product of a broken Britain being torn apart and yes, we are fucking angry - is anybody gonna fight back?"
Breakup.
On the 3rd of April, 2012, Itch announced officially the breakup of the band. He released this official statement :
Jonny "Itch" Fox has confirmed that he has started a solo project and is releasing music under the name "Itch". His first EP, "Manifesto Pt. 1: How to Fucking Rule at Life" was released online on November 26, 2012.
Jamie Jazz also has started a new project with guitarist Paul Mullen (, The Automatic), Charlie Elliot and Invisible Frank. Bleach Blood signed with The King Blues previous record label Transmission Recordings and released their first release, a four track EP 'The Young Heartbreaker's Club' in November, 2012. The EP was met with critical acclaim and they played their debut show to a packed Water Rats in Kings Cross.
The band have spent the last two months in and out of the studio. Their first single, 'Anything, Anything', featuring vocals from Linda Harrison was released on the 24th of March 2013. The single has had heavy rotation on radio stations BBC Radio 1, Kerrang radio and XFM.

Martin Grech

Martin Grech (born 1982) is a Maltese-English singer, songwriter and musician from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.
Career.
He first achieved critical acclaim after his falsetto track, "Open Heart Zoo" (written when he was 15 years old) was featured on a Lexus advert on British television in 2002. A debut album of the same name (produced by Andy Ross) quickly achieved cult status, with the record being compared, in places, to the work of The Cure, Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails and Jeff Buckley. The accompanying UK tour saw Grech gain a larger following and further critical support.
2005 saw the arrival of Grech's second album, "Unholy". It dealt with much darker, and more disturbing themes than his debut record, including such lyrical topics as insanity, heresy and death. As before, reviews were positive and his fan base expanded. The "Unholy" art work created by Stephen Kasner was hung as a backdrop to his concerts.
Grech split with Island Records shortly after the release of "Unholy", but Grech's MySpace page announced the arrival of the new album, "March of the Lonely". The first single from the album, "The Heritage", was released as a CD single on 30 March 2007 on Grech's own record label, 'Martin Grech Songs' via the online label, Burning Shed. "March of the Lonely" took a completely different approach from his previous CDs, and was much more acoustic, more guitar-based, with a thinner texture and softer atmosphere. "March of the Lonely" was released on 4 June 2007 in the UK via Genepool Records.
After moving to California, Grech began working on new material under the name 'Meatsuit'. Demos on MySpace revealed a development of a heavier gothic sound, but in December 2008 Grech announced that his Meatsuit project had been terminated.
In April 2011, Grech released a collection of demos under the title 'Meta'. Also on his BandCamp page, Grech announced his fourth album would be titled "The Watcher".
Other work.
In 2003 Grech was invited to play at the Jeff Buckley tribute concert by Buckley's mother Mary Guibert, at the Garage, Highbury alongside Ed Harcourt and Jamie Cullum. In 2005, Adam White sampled "Open Heart Zoo" for his trance track "Ballerina". In 2008 Grech created the film score to the Adam Mason film, "Blood River".
As well as his solo releases, Grech has performed vocals on the album "First Chance I Get I'm Out Of Here" (2005) by fellow Aylesbury musician, Zealey. He drummed for the four-piece rock band Ophelia Torah between early 2006 and April 2007.
Grech has also been involved in a collaboration project, organised by , called 'Print is Dead'. Along with Bloc Party, Graham Coxon, Tom Vek, Reuben and Biffy Clyro, he worked with yourcodenameis:milo, in their recording studio, to write a song in one day. The track was called "We Hope You Are What You Think You Are".

List of sets of four countries that border one another

This is a list of sets of at least four countries that border one another. In the typical case, three countries that border one another form a ring around a landlocked fourth. Examples of states in the centers of such configurations include Burundi, Luxembourg, Malawi and Paraguay.
No more than four contiguous countries can share borders since the complete graph is not planar. On the other hand, non-contiguous countries that have exclaves (sometimes in the form of dependent territories) may form sets of five or more. Also, when regarding point borders as borders (e.g. Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado at the Four Corners in the U.S.), theoretically any number of regions may meet at one point and all may be considered as bordering one another.
As of the 2006 breakup of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, there are at least twelve four-country sets in the world in which each country shares a boundary (land or fresh water) with the others (thirteen when including states with limited recognition).
South America.
Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia.
This set has existed since the early-mid 19th century. In the early 19th century all that existed was the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata and the Portuguese colony of Brazil. With the independence of Argentina (revolution in 1810, fully achieved 1816) and Paraguay (1811) the four-border set began to emerge, and was consolidated by the Brazilian and Bolivian independence (1822 and 1825, respectively).
Northeastern and Eastern Europe.
Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia.
This set has existed since the 1991 Dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Russian Kaliningrad Oblast, an exclave on the Baltic Sea, creates a Russian border with Lithuania. Belarus and Latvia share boundaries with both mainland Russia and Lithuania.
Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Russia.
This set has existed since the 1991 Dissolution of the Soviet Union.
The Russian Kaliningrad Oblast, an exclave on the Baltic Sea, creates Russian borders with both Lithuania and Poland. Belarus does not border Kaliningrad, but has borders with mainland Russia, Lithuania, and Poland.
Belarus, Poland, Russia, Ukraine.
This set has existed since the 1991 Dissolution of the Soviet Union.
The Russian Kaliningrad Oblast, an exclave on the Baltic Sea, creates a Russian border with Poland.
Western Europe.
Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, France.
This set has existed since the 1830 Independence of Belgium. Even though the German lands have had many territorial changes, Prussia's Rhine Province and later the various unified German states have always bordered the other three countries.
The only land boundary between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and France is on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, where the Dutch constituent country of Sint Maarten meets the French Overseas Collectivity of Saint Martin.
Luxembourg, France, Germany, Belgium.
This set has existed since the 1839 independence of Luxembourg.
Southeastern Europe.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia.
This set has existed since the 2006 independence of Montenegro.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has 20 km of coastline on the Adriatic Sea while Croatia borders Montenegro only through the non-contiguous southern portion of the Dubrovačko-neretvanska county, which is an exclave connected to the rest of Croatia only by territorial waters.
Caucasus.
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey, Iran.
This set has existed since the 1991 Dissolution of the Soviet Union. Azerbaijan has a border with Turkey through its exclave of Nakhichevan.
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Turkey.
This set has existed since the 1991 Dissolution of the Soviet Union. Azerbaijan has a border with Turkey through its exclave of Nakhichevan.
Africa.
Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of the Congo.
This set has existed since the 1962 change of the united Belgian colony of Ruanda-Urundi into the independent states of Burundi and Rwanda. The Democratic Republic of the Congo had achieved independence in 1960 and was followed the next year by Tanganyika, which would later merge with Zanzibar to form Tanzania. The border between DR Congo and Tanzania is entirely aquatic; the two countries are separated by Lake Tanganyika.
Rwanda, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania.
By the time of Ugandan independence in 1962, all of the borders of this set were already established. DR Congo and Tanzania are separated by Lake Tanganyika.
Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Tanzania.
This set has existed since the 1964 independence of Zambia and Malawi. Mozambique became independent from Portugal in 1975.
Sets involving states with limited recognition.
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Iran, Nagorno-Karabakh.
This de facto set has existed since the 1992 Nagorno-Karabakh declaration of independence.
The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is claimed in whole by Azerbaijan and not recognised as independent by any UN member state or observer state.
Near misses.
If one includes states with limited recognition, the following near misses also exist:
Former border sets of at least four countries.
The first two sets below include boundaries shared by former colonial empires (specifically territorial claims in South America, Africa, India, Europe, and the East and West Indies), and thus do not reflect continuous areas of land. In the third one it is referred to Nazi Germany after its annexation of Austria.

Al Jolson

Al Jolson (born Asa Yoelson; May 26, 1886 – October 23, 1950) was an Lithuanian-born American singer, film actor, and comedian. At the peak of his career, he was dubbed "The World's Greatest Entertainer".
His performing style was brash and extroverted, and he popularized a large number of songs that benefited from his "shamelessly sentimental, melodramatic approach". Numerous well-known singers were influenced by his music, including Bing Crosby David Bowie, Bob Dylan and others, Dylan once referred to him as "somebody whose life I can feel". Broadway critic Gilbert Seldes compared him to the Greek god Pan, claiming that Jolson represented "the concentration of our national health and gaiety."
In the 1930s, he was America's most famous and highest-paid entertainer. Between 1911 and 1928, Jolson had nine sell-out Winter Garden shows in a row, more than 80 hit records, and 16 national and international tours. Although he is best remembered today as the star of the first 'talking picture', "The Jazz Singer" (1927), he later starred in a series of successful musical films throughout the 1930s. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Jolson became the first star to entertain troops overseas during World War II. After a period of inactivity, his stardom returned with "The Jolson Story" (1946). Larry Parks played Jolson, with the singer dubbing for Parks. The formula was repeated in the sequel, "Jolson Sings Again" (1949). In 1950 he again became the first star to entertain GIs on active service in the Korean War, performing 42 shows in 16 days. He died just weeks after returning to the U.S., partly owing to the physical exertion of performing. Defense Secretary George Marshall afterward awarded the Medal of Merit to Jolson's family.
According to the "St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture", "Jolson was to jazz, blues, and ragtime what Elvis Presley was to rock 'n' roll." Being the first popular singer to make a spectacular "event" out of singing a song, he became a “rock star” before the dawn of rock music. His specialty was performing on stage runways extending out into the audience. He would run up and down the runway and across the stage, "teasing, cajoling, and thrilling the audience," often stopping to sing to individual members; all the while the "perspiration would be pouring from his face, and the entire audience would get caught up in the ecstasy of his performance." According to music historian Larry Stempel, "No one had heard anything quite like it before on Broadway." Author Stephen Banfield agreed, writing that Jolson's style was "arguably the single most important factor in defining the modern musical..."
He enjoyed performing in blackface makeup, a theatrical convention since the mid 19th century. With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music, such as jazz and blues, he was later credited with single-handedly introducing African-American music to white audiences. As early as 1911 he became known for fighting against anti-black discrimination on Broadway.
Early life.
Al Jolson was born as Asa Yoelson () in the Jewish village of Srednik () now known as Seredžius, near Kaunas in Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire. He was the fifth and youngest child of Moses Reuben and Naomi (Cantor) Yoelson; his four siblings were Rose, Etta, another sister who died in infancy, and Hirsch (Harry). Jolson did not know the date of his birth, so he later chose to celebrate it as May 26, 1886. In 1891, his father, who was qualified as a rabbi and cantor, moved to New York to secure a better future for his family. By 1894, Moses Yoelson could afford to pay the fare to bring Naomi and his four children to America. By the time they arrived, he had found work at the Talmud Torah Synagogue in the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where the family was reunited.
Hard times hit the family when his mother, Naomi, died in late 1894. Following his mother's death, young Asa was in a state of withdrawal for seven months. Upon being introduced to show business in 1895 by entertainer Al Reeves, Asa and Hirsch became fascinated by the industry, and by 1897 the brothers were singing for coins on local street corners, using the names "Al" and "Harry.". They would usually use the money to buy tickets to shows at the National Theater. Asa and Hirsch spent most of their days working different jobs as a team.
Stage performer.
Blackface.
In 1904, while playing an engagement at Keeney's Theatre in Brooklyn, Al started performing in blackface, supposedly at the suggestion of veteran blackface comedian James Francis Dooley. Working behind a burnt cork mask gave Al a sense of freedom and spontaneity he had never known before. The act became a surefire laugh-getter, and was soon booked on vaudeville's Orpheum circuit.
Burlesque and vaudeville.
In the spring of 1902, he accepted a job with Walter L. Main's Circus. Although Main had hired Jolson as an usher, Main was impressed by Jolson's singing voice and gave him a position as a singer during the circus's Indian Medicine Side Show segment.
By the end of the year, the circus had folded and Jolson was again out of work. In May 1903, the head producer of the burlesque show "Dainty Duchess Burlesquers" agreed to give Jolson a part in one show. Asa gave a remarkable performance of "Be My Baby Bumble Bee" and the producer agreed to keep him for future shows. Unfortunately, the show closed by the end of the year. Asa was able to avoid financial troubles by forming a vaudeville partnership with his brother Hirsch, now a vaudeville performer known as Harry Yoelson. The brothers worked for the William Morris Agency.
Asa and Harry soon formed a team with Joe Palmer. During their time with Palmer, they were able to gain bookings in a nationwide tour. However, live performances were falling in popularity as nickelodeon theaters captured audiences; by 1908, nickelodeon theaters were dominant throughout New York City as well. While performing in a Brooklyn theater in 1904, Al decided on a new approach and began wearing blackface makeup. The conversion to blackface boosted his career, and he began wearing blackface in all of his shows.
In the fall of 1905, Harry left the trio following a harsh argument with Al. Harry had refused Al's request to take care of Joe Palmer, who was in a wheelchair, while he was dating. After Harry's departure, Al and Joe Palmer worked as a duo but were not particularly successful. By 1906 the two agreed to separate, and Jolson was on his own.
Al became a regular at the Globe and Wigwam Theater in San Francisco, California, and remained successful nationwide as a vaudeville singer. He took up residence in San Francisco, saying the earthquake-devastated people needed someone to cheer them up. In 1908 Jolson, needing money for himself and his new wife, Henrietta, returned to New York. In 1909, Al's singing caught the attention of Lew Dockstader, the producer and star of Dockstader's Minstrels. Al accepted Dockstader's offer and became a regular blackface performer.
Broadway playhouses.
Winter Garden Theater.
According to "Esquire" magazine, "J.J. Shubert, impressed by Jolson’s overpowering display of energy, booked him for "La Belle Paree", a musical comedy that opened at the Winter Garden in 1911. Within a month Jolson was a star. From then until 1926, when he retired from the stage, he could boast an unbroken series of smash hits."
On March 20, 1911, Jolson starred in his first musical revue at the Winter Garden Theater in New York City, "La Belle Paree", greatly helping to launch his career as a singer. The opening night drew a huge crowd to the theater, and that evening Jolson gained audience popularity by singing old Stephen Foster songs in blackface. In the wake of that opening night, Jolson was given a position in the show's cast. The show closed after 104 performances, and during its run Jolson's popularity grew greatly. Following "La Belle Paree", Jolson accepted an offer to perform in the musical "Vera Violetta". The show opened on November 20, 1911 and, like La Belle Paree, was a phenomenal success. In the show, Jolson again sang in blackface and managed to become so popular that his weekly salary of $500 (based on his success in La Belle Paree) was increased to $750.
After "Vera Violetta" ran its course, Jolson starred in another musical, "The Whirl of Society", propelling his career on Broadway to new heights. During his time at the Winter Garden, Jolson would tell the audience, "You ain't heard nothing yet" before performing additional songs. In the play, Jolson debuted his signature blackface character, "Gus." The play was so successful that Winter Garden owner Lee Shubert agreed to sign Jolson to a seven-year contract with a salary of $1,000 a week. Jolson would reprise his role as "Gus" in future plays and by 1914 achieved so much popularity with the theater audience that his $1,000-a-week salary was doubled to $2,000 a week. In 1916, "Robinson Crusoe, Jr." was the first musical in which he was featured as the star character. In 1918, Jolson's acting career would be pushed even further after he starred in the hit musical "Sinbad".
It became the most successful Broadway musical of 1918 and 1919. A new song was later added to the show that would become composer George Gershwin's first hit recording—"Swanee". Jolson also added another song, "My Mammy," to the show. By 1920, Jolson had become the biggest star on Broadway.
Jolson's own theater.
His next play, "Bombo", would also take his career to new heights and became so successful that it went beyond Broadway and held performances nationwide. It also led Lee Shubert to rename his newly built theater, which was across from Central Park, as Jolson's Fifty-ninth Street Theatre. Aged 35, Jolson became the youngest man in American history to have a theatre named after him.
But on the opening night of "Bombo", and the first performance at the new theatre, he suffered from extreme stage fright, walking up and down the streets for hours before showtime. Out of fear, he lost his voice backstage and begged the stagehands not to raise the curtains. But when the curtains went up, he "was standing in the wings trembling and sweating." After being physically shoved onto the stage by his brother Harry, he performed and received an ovation that he would never forget: "For several minutes, the applause continued while Al stood and bowed after the first act." He refused to go back on stage for the second act, but the audience "just stamped its feet and chanted 'Jolson, Jolson', until he came back out." He took thirty-seven curtain calls that night and told the audience, "I'm a happy man tonight."
In March 1922, he moved the production to the larger Century Theater for a special benefit performance to aid injured Jewish veterans of World War I. After taking the show on the road for a season, he returned in May 1923, to perform "Bombo" at "his first love", the Winter Garden. The reviewer for "The New York Times" wrote, "He returned like the circus, bigger and brighter and newer than ever. ... Last night's audience was flatteringly unwilling to go home, and when the show proper was over, Jolson reappeared before the curtain and sang more songs, old and new."
"I don’t mind going on record as saying that he is one of the few instinctively funny men on our stage," wrote reviewer Charles Darnton in the "New York Evening World". "Everything he touches turns to fun. To watch him is to marvel at his humorous vitality. He is the old-time minstrel man turned to modern account. With a song, a word, or even a suggestion he calls forth spontaneous laughter. And here you have the definition of a born comedian."
Performing in blackface.
Performing in blackface makeup was a theatrical convention of many entertainers at the beginning of the 20th century, having its origin in the minstrel show. Working behind a blackface mask "gave him a sense of freedom and spontaneity he had never known." According to film historian Eric Lott, for the white minstrel man "to put on the cultural forms of 'blackness' was to engage in a complex affair of manly mimicry... To wear or even enjoy blackface was literally, for a time, to become black, to inherit the cool, virility, humility, abandon, or gaité de coeur that were the prime components of white ideologies of black manhood."
As metaphor of mutual suffering.
Jazz historians have described Jolson’s blackface and singing style as metaphors for Jewish and black suffering throughout history. Jolson’s first film, "The Jazz Singer", for instance, is described by historian Michael Alexander as an expression of the liturgical music of Jews with the "imagined music of African Americans," noting that "prayer and jazz become metaphors for Jews and blacks." Playwright Samson Raphaelson, after seeing Jolson perform his stage show "Robinson Crusoe", stated that "he had an epiphany: 'My God, this isn’t a jazz singer,' he said. 'This is a cantor!'" The image of the blackfaced cantor remained in Raphaelson’s mind when he conceived of the story which led to "The Jazz Singer".
Upon release of the film, the first full-length sound picture, film reviewers saw the symbolism and metaphors portrayed by Jolson in his role as the son of a cantor wanting to become a "jazz singer":
According to Alexander, East European Jews were uniquely qualified to understand the music, noting how Jolson himself made the comparison of Jewish and African-American suffering in a new land in his film "Big Boy": In a blackface portrayal of a former slave, he leads a group of recently freed slaves, played by black actors, in verses of the classic slave spiritual "Go Down Moses." One reviewer of the film expressed how Jolson’s blackface added significance to his role:
Many in the black community welcomed "The Jazz Singer", and saw it as a vehicle to gain access to the stage. Audiences at Harlem's Lafayette Theater cried during the film, and Harlem's newspaper, "Amsterdam News," called it "one of the greatest pictures ever produced." For Jolson, it wrote: "Every colored performer is proud of him."
Relations with African-Americans.
Jolson first heard African-American music, such as jazz, blues, and ragtime, played in the back alleys of New Orleans, Louisiana. He enjoyed singing the "new" jazz-style of music. Often performing in blackface, especially in the songs he made popular, such as "Swanee", "My Mammy", and "Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody". In most of his movie roles, however, including a singing hobo in "Hallelujah, I'm a Bum" or a jailed convict in "Say It With Songs", he chose to act without using blackface. In the film "The Jazz Singer" (1927), he performed only a few songs, including "My Mammy", in blackface, but the film is concerned in part with the experience of "donning a mask" that the young Jewish singer embraces in performing popular songs onstage.
As a Jewish immigrant and America's most famous and highest-paid entertainer, he may have had the incentive and resources to help break down racial attitudes. For instance, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) during its peak in the early 1920s, included about 15% of the nation's eligible voting population, 4-5 million men. While D. W. Griffith's movie "The Birth of a Nation" glorified white supremacy and the KKK, Jolson chose to star in "The Jazz Singer", which defied racial bigotry by introducing American black music to audiences worldwide.
While growing up, Jolson had many black friends, including Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, who later became a prominent tap dancer. As early as 1911, at the age of 25, Jolson was already noted for fighting discrimination on the Broadway stage and later in his movies:
Jolson once read in the newspaper that songwriters Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, neither of whom he had ever heard of, were refused service at a Connecticut restaurant because of their race. He immediately tracked them down and took them out to dinner "insisting he'd punch anyone in the nose who tried to kick us out!" Subsequent to their meeting, according to biographer Al Rose, Jolson and Blake became friends. Rose writes:
Film historian Charles Musser notes that "African Americans' embrace of Jolson was not a spontaneous reaction to his appearance in talking pictures. In an era when African Americans did not have to go looking for enemies, Jolson was perceived a friend."
Jeni LeGon, a black female tap dance star, recalls her life as a film dancer: "But of course, in those times it was a 'black-and-white world.' You didn't associate too much socially with any of the stars. You saw them at the studio, you know, nice—but they didn't invite. The only ones that ever invited us home for a visit was Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler." Brian Conley, former star of the 1995 British play "Jolson", stated during an interview, "I found out Jolson was actually a hero to the black people of America. At his funeral, black actors lined the way, they really appreciated what he’d done for them." Noble Sissle, then president of the Negro Actors Guild, represented that organization at his funeral.
Jolson's physical expressiveness also affected the music styles of some black performers. Music historian Bob Gulla writes that "the most critical influence in Jackie Wilson's young life was Al Jolson." He points out that Wilson's ideas of what a stage performer could do to keep their act an "exciting" and "thrilling performance" was shaped by Jolson's acts, "full of wild writhing and excessive theatrics." Wilson felt that Jolson, along with Louis Jordan, another of his idols, "should be considered the stylistic forefathers of rock and roll."
According to the "St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture": "Almost single-handedly, Jolson helped to introduce African-American musical innovations like jazz, ragtime, and the blues to white audiences... paved the way for African-American performers like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters... to bridge the cultural gap between black and white America." Jazz historian Amiri Baraka wrote, "the entrance of the white man into jazz...did at least bring him much closer to the Negro." He points out that "the acceptance of jazz by whites marks a crucial moment when an aspect of black culture had become an essential part of American culture."
In a recent interview, Clarence 'Frogman' Henry, one of the most popular and respected jazz singers of New Orleans, said: "Jolson? I loved him. I think he did wonders for the blacks and glorified entertainment."
Movies.
"The Jazz Singer".
In the first part of the 20th century, Al Jolson was without question the most popular performer on Broadway and in vaudeville. Show-business historians regard him as a legendary institution. Yet for all his success in live venues, Jolson is possibly best remembered today for his numerous recordings and for starring in "The Jazz Singer" (1927), generally considered the first feature film that included synchronized sound dialogue sequences as well as music and sound effects.
Jolson had actually starred in a talking film "before" "The Jazz Singer": a 1926 short subject entitled "A Plantation Act". This simulation of a stage performance by Jolson was originally presented in a program of musical shorts, demonstrating the Vitaphone sound-film process. The soundtrack for "A Plantation Act" was considered lost in 1933, but was found in 1995 and restored by The Vitaphone Project. The short was included in Warner's 80th Anniversary release of "The Jazz Singer" on DVD.
Warner Bros. had originally picked George Jessel for the role, as he had starred in the Broadway play. When Sam Warner decided to make "The Jazz Singer" a musical with the Vitaphone, he knew that Jolson was the star he needed to put it over. He told Jessel that he would have to sing in the movie, and Jessel balked, allowing Warner's to replace him with Jolson. Jessel never got over it and often said that Warner's gave the role to Jolson because he agreed to help finance the film.
The movie premiere.
Harry Warner's daughter, Doris Warner, remembered the opening night, and said that when the picture started she was still crying over the loss of her beloved uncle Sam, who was planning to be there but died suddenly, at the age of 40, the day before. But halfway through the 89-minute movie she began to be overtaken by a sense that something remarkable was happening. Jolson's "Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet..." provoked shouts of pleasure and applause. After each Jolson song, the audience applauded. Excitement mounted as the film progressed, and when Jolson began his scene with Eugenie Besserer, "the audience became hysterical."
According to film historian Scott Eyman, "by the film's end, the Warner brothers had shown an audience something they had never known, moved them in a way they hadn't expected. The tumultuous ovation at curtain proved that Jolson was not merely the right man for the part of Jackie Rabinowitz, alias Jack Robin; he was the right man for the entire transition from silent fantasy to talking realism. The audience, transformed into what one critic called, 'a milling, battling mob' stood, stamped, and cheered 'Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!'"
At the end of the film, Jolson rose from his seat and ran down to the stage. "God, I think you're really on the level about it. I feel good" he cried to the audience. Stanley Watkins would always remember Jolson signing autographs after the show, tears streaming down his face. May McAvoy, Jolson's costar remembered that " police were there to control the crowds. It was a very big thing, like "The Birth of a Nation"."
Introduction of sound.
The film was produced by Warner Bros., using its new Vitaphone sound process. Vitaphone was originally intended for musical renditions, and "The Jazz Singer" follows this principle, with only the musical sequences using live sound recording. The moviegoers were electrified when the silent actions were interrupted periodically for a song sequence with real singing and sound. Jolson's dynamic voice, physical mannerisms, and charisma held the audience spellbound.
Costar May McAvoy, according to author A. Scott Berg, could not help sneaking into theaters day after day as the film was being run. "She pinned herself against a wall in the dark and watched the faces in the crowd. In that moment just before 'Toot, Toot, Tootsie,' she remembered, 'A miracle occurred. Moving pictures really came alive. To see the expressions on their faces, when Joley spoke to them ... you'd have thought they were listening to the voice of God.'" "Everybody was mad for the talkies," said movie star Gregory Peck in a "Newsweek" interview. "I remember " 'The Jazz Singer,' " when Al Jolson just burst into song, and there was a little bit of dialogue. And when he came out with 'Mammy,' and went down on his knees to his Mammy, it was just dynamite."
This opinion is shared by Mast and Kawin:
Jewish meanings.
Cultural historian Linda Williams notes that ""The Jazz Singer" represents the triumphs of the assimilating son over the old-world father ... and present impediments to an assimilating show-biz success... when Jakie's father says, 'Stop', the flow of "jazz" music (and spontaneous speech) freezes. But the Jewish mother recognizes the virtue of the old world in the new and the music flows again." According to film historian Robert Carringer, even the father eventually comes to understand that his son's jazz singing is "fundamentally an ancient religious impulse seeking expression in a modern, popular form". Or as the film itself states in its first title card, "perhaps this plaintive, wailing song of jazz is, after all, the misunderstood utterance of a prayer."
Film historian Scott Eyman also describes the cultural perspective of the film:
Other feature films.
With Warner Bros., Al Jolson made his first "all-talking" picture, "The Singing Fool" (1928) — the story of a driven entertainer who insisted upon going on with the show even as his small son lay dying, and its signature tune, "Sonny Boy," became the first American record to sell one million copies. The film was even more popular than "The Jazz Singer", and even though there was still a relatively small number of theaters across the country capable of showing the picture with sound, it held the record for box-office attendance for 11 years, until broken by "Gone With the Wind" a decade later.
Jolson continued to make features for Warner Bros., very similar in style to "The Singing Fool", "Say It with Songs" (1929), "Mammy" (1930), and "Big Boy" (1930). A restored version of "Mammy", which includes Jolson in some Technicolor sequences, was first screened in 2002. (Jolson's first Technicolor appearance was in a cameo in the musical "Show Girl in Hollywood" (1930) from First National Pictures, a Warner Bros. subsidiary.) The sameness of the stories, Jolson's large salary, and changing public tastes in musicals contributed to the films' diminishing returns over the next few years. As a result of this, Jolson decided to return to Broadway, and starred in a new show entitled "Wonder Bar", which was not very successful.
"Hallelujah, I'm a Bum/Hallelujah, I'm a Tramp".
Despite these new troubles, Jolson was able to make a comeback after performing a concert in New Orleans after "Wonderbar" closed in 1931. Warners allowed him to make one film with United Artists, "Hallelujah, I'm a Bum", in 1933 (the film had to be retitled "Hallelujah, I'm a Tramp" in the UK and other English-speaking countries where "bum" means "butt" and where the slang word for a vagrant is "tramp" rather than "bum"). It was directed by Lewis Milestone and written by screenwriter Ben Hecht. Hecht was also active in the promotion of civil rights: "Hecht film stories featuring black characters included "Hallelujah, I'm a Bum", co-starring Edgar Connor as Al Jolson's sidekick, in a politically savvy rhymed dialogue over Richard Rodgers music."
A direct response to the Great Depression, it contains messages to his vagabond friends equivalent to "there's more to life than money" and "the best things in life are free". "The New York Times" reviewer wrote, "The picture, some persons may be glad to hear, has no Mammy song. It is Mr. Jolson's best film and well it might be, for that clever director, Lewis Milestone, guided its destiny... a combination of fun, melody and romance, with a dash of satire..." Another review added, "A film to welcome back, especially for what it tries to do for the progress of the American musical..."
"Wonder Bar" (1934).
In 1934, he starred in a movie version of his earlier stage play, Wonder Bar, and co-starred Kay Francis, Dolores del Río, Ricardo Cortez, and Dick Powell. The movie is a "musical Grand Hotel, set in the Parisian nightclub owned by Al Wonder (Jolson). Wonder entertains and banters with his international clientele."
Reviews were generally positive: ""Wonder Bar" has got about everything. Romance, flash, dash, class, color, songs, star-studded talent and almost every known requisite to assure sturdy attention and attendance... It's Jolson's comeback picture in every respect."; and, "Those who like Jolson should see Wonder Bar for it is mainly Jolson; singing the old reliables; cracking jokes which would have impressed Noah as depressingly ancient; and moving about with characteristic energy." Returning to Warners, Jolson bowed to new production ideas, focusing less on the star and more on elaborately cinematic numbers staged by Busby Berkeley and Bobby Connolly. This new approach worked, sustaining Jolson's movie career until the Warner contract lapsed in 1935. Jolson co-starred with his actress-dancer wife, Ruby Keeler, only once, in "Go Into Your Dance".
"The Singing Kid" (1936).
Jolson's last Warner vehicle was "The Singing Kid" (1936), a parody of Jolson's stage persona (he plays a character named Al Jackson) in which he pokes fun at his stage histrionics and taste for "mammy" songs—the latter via a number by E. Y. Harburg and Harold Arlen titled "I Love to Singa", and a comedy sequence with Jolson doggedly trying to sing "Mammy" while The Yacht Club Boys keep telling him such songs are outdated.
According to jazz historian Michael Alexander, Jolson had once griped that "People have been making fun of Mammy songs, and I don't really think that it's right that they should, for after all, Mammy songs are the fundamental songs of our country." In this film, he notes, "Jolson had the confidence to rhyme 'Mammy' with 'Uncle Sammy'", adding "Mammy songs, along with the vocation 'Mammy singer', were inventions of the Jewish Jazz Age."
The film also gave a boost to the career of black singer and bandleader Cab Calloway, who performed a number of songs alongside Jolson. In his autobiography, Calloway writes about this episode:
"The Singing Kid" was not one of the studio's major attractions (it was released by the First National subsidiary), and Jolson did not even rate star billing. The song "I Love to Singa" later appeared in Tex Avery's cartoon of the same name. The movie also became the first important role for future child star Sybil Jason in a scene directed by Busby Berkeley. Jason remembers that Berkeley worked on the film although he is not credited.
"Rose of Washington Square" (1939).
His next movie—his first with Twentieth Century-Fox—was "Rose of Washington Square" (1939). It stars Jolson, Alice Faye and Tyrone Power, and included many of Jolson's best known songs, although a several songs were cut to shorten the movie's length, including "April Showers" and "Avalon". Reviewers wrote, "Mr Jolson's singing of "Mammy", California, Here I Come and others is something for the memory book." and "Of the three co-stars this is Jolson's picture ... because it's a pretty good catalog in anybody's hit parade." The movie was released on DVD in October 2008. Twentieth Century-Fox hired him to re-create a scene from "The Jazz Singer" in the Alice Faye-Don Ameche film "Hollywood Cavalcade". Guest appearances in two more Fox films followed that same year, but Jolson never starred in a full-length feature film again.
"The Jolson Story".
After the success of the George M. Cohan film biography, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (1942), Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky believed that a similar film could be made about Al Jolson—and he knew just where to pitch the project. Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia Pictures, loved the music of Al Jolson.
Skolsky pitched the idea of an Al Jolson biopic and Cohn agreed. It was directed by Alfred E. Green, best remembered for the pre-Code "Baby Face" (1933), with musical numbers staged by Joseph H. Lewis. With Jolson providing almost all the vocals, and Columbia contract player Larry Parks playing Jolson, "The Jolson Story" (1946) became one of the biggest box-office hits of the year.
Larry Parks wrote, in a personal tribute to Jolson:"Stepping into his shoes was, for me, a matter of endless study, observation, energetic concentration to obtain, perfectly if possible, a simulation of the kind of man he was. It is not surprising, therefore, that while making "The Jolson Story", I spent 107 days before the cameras and lost eighteen pounds in weight."From a review in "Variety":"But the real star of the production is that Jolson voice and that Jolson medley. It was good showmanship to cast this film with lesser people, particularly Larry Parks as the mammy kid... As for Jolson's voice, it has never been better. Thus the magic of science has produced a composite whole to eclipse the original at his most youthful best."Parks received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Although Jolson was too old to play himself in the film, he persuaded the studio to let him appear in one musical sequence, "Swanee", shot entirely in long shot, with Jolson in blackface singing and dancing onto the runway leading into the middle of the theater. In the wake of the film's success, Jolson became a top singer among the American public once more. Decca Records signed Jolson and he recorded for Decca until his death.
Critical observations.
According to film historian Krin Gabbard, "The Jolson Story" goes further than any of the earlier films in exploring the significance of blackface and the relationships that whites have developed with blacks in the area of music. To him, the film seems to imply an inclination of white performers, like Jolson, who are possessed with "the joy of life and enough sensitivity, to appreciate the musical accomplishments of blacks". To support his view he describes a significant part of the movie:
"While wandering around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club where a group of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows just make it up as they go along. They pick it up out of the air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances ... Jolson's success is built on anticipating what Americans really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero."
This has been a theme which was traditionally "dear to the hearts of the men who made the movies." Film historian George Custen describes this "common scenario, in which the hero is vindicated for innovations that are initially greeted with resistance ... he struggle of the heroic protagonist who anticipates changes in cultural attitudes is central to other white jazz biopics such as "The Glenn Miller Story" (1954) and "The Benny Goodman Story" (1955)". "Once we accept a semantic change from singing to playing the clarinet, "The Benny Goodman Story" becomes an almost transparent reworking of "The Jazz Singer" ... and "The Jolson Story"."
"Jolson Sings Again" (1949).
A sequel, "Jolson Sings Again" (1949), opened at Loew's State Theatre in New York and received positive reviews: "Mr. Jolson's name is up in lights again and Broadway is wreathed in smiles", wrote Thomas Pryor in "The New York Times". "That's as it should be, for "Jolson Sings Again" is an occasion which warrants some lusty cheering...". Jolson did a tour of New York film theaters to plug the movie, traveling with a police convoy to make timetables for all showings, often ad libbing jokes and performing songs for the audience. Extra police were on duty as crowds jammed the streets and sidewalks at each theater Jolson visited. In Chicago, a few weeks later, he sang to 100,000 people at Soldier Field, and later that night appeared at the Oriental Theatre with George Jessel where 10,000 people had to be turned away.
In Baltimore, Maryland, he took his wife Erle to see St Mary's Catholic School where he was confined for a while as a boy and treated for tuberculosis. He introduced her to the same priest, Father Benjamin, who watched over him. That night, Jolson took over two hundred of the church's kids to see "Jolson Sings Again" at the Hippodrome Theatre. A few weeks later, the Jolsons were received by President Harry Truman at the White House.
Radio shows.
Jolson had been a popular guest star on radio since its earliest days, including on NBC's "The Dodge Victory Hour" (January 1928), singing from a New Orleans hotel to an audience of 35 million via 47 radio stations. His own 1930s shows included "Presenting Al Jolson" (1932) and "Shell Chateau" (1935), and he was the host of the "Kraft Music Hall" from 1947 to 1949, with Oscar Levant as a sardonic, piano-playing sidekick. Despite such singers as Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Perry Como being in their primes, Jolson was voted the "Most Popular Male Vocalist" in 1948 by a poll in "Variety".
The next year, Jolson was named "Personality of the Year" by the Variety Clubs of America. When Jolson appeared on Bing Crosby's radio show, he attributed his receiving the award to his being the only singer not to make a record of "Mule Train," which had been a widely covered hit of that year (four different versions, one of them by Crosby, had made the top ten on the charts). Jolson even joked that he had tried to sing the hit song "I got the clippetys all right, but I can't clop like I used to."
Television work.
When Jolson appeared on Steve Allen's KNX Los Angeles radio show in 1949 to promote "Jolson Sings Again", he offered his curt opinion of the burgeoning television industry: "I call it smell-evision." Writer Hal Kanter recalled that Jolson's own idea of his television debut would be a corporate-sponsored, extra-length spectacular that would feature him as the only performer, and would be telecast without interruption. In 1950, it was announced that Jolson agreed to appear on the CBS television network. However, he died before production could be initiated.
World War II and Korean War tours.
World War II.
Japanese bombs on Pearl Harbor shook Jolson out of continuing moods of lethargy due to years of little activity and "... he dedicated himself to a new mission in life... Even before the U.S.O. began to set up a formal program overseas, the excitable Jolson was deluging War and Navy Department brass with phone calls and wires. He demanded permission to go anywhere in the world where there is an American serviceman who wouldn’t mind listening to ‘Sonny Boy’ or ‘Mammy’... early in 1942, Jolson became the first star to perform at a GI base in World War II".
From a "New York Times" interview in 1942: "When the war started... felt that it was up to me to do something, and the only thing I know is show business. I went around during the last war and I saw that the boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, so I told the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army." Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, volunteering "to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he "would work without pay... would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose". A few weeks later, he received his first tour schedule from the newly formed United Services Organization (USO), "the group his letter to Early had helped create".
He did as many as four shows a day in the jungle outposts of Central America and covered the string of U.S. Naval bases. He paid for part of the transportation out of his own pocket. Upon doing his first, and unannounced, show in England in 1942, the reporter for the "Hartford Courant" wrote, "... it was a panic. And pandemonium... when he was done the applause that shook that soldier-packed room was like bombs falling again in Shaftsbury Avenue."
From an article in the "New York Times": "He has been to more Army camps and played to more soldiers than any other entertainer. He has crossed the Atlantic by plane to take song and cheer to the troops in Britain and Northern Ireland. He has flown to the cold wastes of Alaska and the steaming forests of Trinidad. He has called at Dutch‑like Curaçao. Nearly every camp in this country has heard him sing and tell funny stories." Some of the unusual hardships of performing to active troops were described in an article he wrote for "Variety," in 1942: "In order to entertain all the boys ... it became necessary for us to give shows in foxholes, gun emplacements, dugouts, to construction groups on military roads; in fact, any place where two or more soldiers were gathered together, it automatically became a Winter Garden for me and I would give a show." After returning from a tour of overseas bases, the Regimental Hostess at one camp wrote to Jolson, "Allow me to say on behalf of all the soldiers of the 33rd Infantry that you coming here is quite the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to us, and we think you're tops, not only as a performer, but as a person. We unanimously elect you Public Morale Lifter No. 1 of the U.S Army."
Jolson was officially enlisted in the United Service Organizations (USO), the organization which provided entertainment for American troops who served in combat overseas. While serving in the USO, he received a Specialist rating due to his age, which would permit him to wear a uniform and have the same standing as an officer. During his time entertaining troops he caught malaria and lost a lung.
In 1946, during a nationally broadcast testimonial dinner in New York City, given on his behalf, he received a special tribute from the American Veterans Committee in honor of his volunteer services during WWII. And in 1949, the movie "Jolson Sings Again" recreated some scenes showing Jolson during his war tours.
Korean War.
In 1950, according to Jolson's biographer Michael Freedland, "the United States answered the call of the United Nations Security Council ... and had gone to fight the North Koreans. ... rang the White House again. 'I'm gonna go to Korea,' he told a startled official on the phone. 'No one seems to know anything about the USO, and it's up to President Truman to get me there.' He was promised that President Truman and General MacArthur, who had taken command of the Korean front, would get to hear of his offer. But for four weeks there was nothing. ... Finally, Louis A. Johnson, Secretary of Defense, sent Jolson a telegram. 'Sorry for delay but regret no funds for entertainment-STOP; USO disbanded-STOP.' The message was as much an assault on the Jolson sense of patriotism as the actual crossing of the 38th Parallel had been. 'What are they talkin' about', he thundered. 'Funds? Who needs funds? I got funds! I'll pay myself!'"
On September 17, 1950, a dispatch from 8th Army Headquarters, Korea, announced, "Al Jolson, the first top-flight entertainer to reach the war-front, landed here today by plane from Los Angeles..." Jolson traveled to Korea at his own expense. "nd a lean, smiling Jolson drove himself without letup through 42 shows in 16 days."
Before returning to the U.S., General Douglas MacArthur, leader of UN forces, gave him a medallion inscribed "To Al Jolson from Special Services in appreciation of entertainment of armed forces personnel ‑ Far East Command”, with his entire itinerary inscribed on the reverse side. A few months later, an important bridge, named the "Al Jolson Bridge", was used to withdraw the bulk of American troops from North Korea. The bridge was the last remaining of three bridges across the Han River and was used to evacuate UN forces. It was demolished by UN forces after the army made it safely across in order to prevent the Chinese from crossing.
Alistair Cooke wrote, "He had one last hour of glory. He offered to fly to Korea and entertain the troops hemmed in on the United Nations precarious August bridgehead. The troops yelled for his appearance. He went down on his knee again and sang 'Mammy', and the troops wept and cheered. When he was asked what Korea was like he warmly answered, 'I am going to get back my income tax returns and see if I paid enough.'"
Entertainer Jack Benny, who went to Korea the following year, noted that an amphitheater in Korea where troops were entertained, was named the "Al Jolson Bowl."
Just 10 days after he returned from Korea, he had agreed with R.K.O. producers Jerry Wald and Norman Krasna to star in a new movie, "Stars and Stripes for Ever", about a U.S.O. troupe in the South Pacific during World War II. The screenplay was to be written by Herbert Baker, writer of the 1980 version of "The Jazz Singer" starring Neil Diamond. The film was to costar singer Dinah Shore.
But just two weeks after the agreement, Jolson died suddenly of a heart attack in San Francisco, due partly to the physical exertions he had made in Korea. He was survived by his wife and their two recently adopted children. A few months after his death, Defense Secretary George Marshall presented the Medal for Merit to Jolson, "to whom this country owes a debt which cannot be repaid". The medal, carrying a citation noting that Jolson's "contribution to the U.N. action in Korea was made at the expense of his life", was presented to Jolson's adopted son as Jolson's widow looked on. Columbia too had been thinking about a third Jolson musical, and this time Jolson would play himself. The project, tentatively entitled "You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet", was to dramatize Jolson's recent tours of military bases. The film was never made.
Personal life.
Politics.
Jolson was a political and economic conservative, supporting both Warren G. Harding in 1920 and Calvin Coolidge in 1924 for president of the United States. As "one of the biggest stars of his time, worked his magic singing "Harding, You're the Man for Us" to enthralled audiences ... [and was subsequently asked to perform "Keep Cool with Coolidge" four years later. ... Jolson, like the men who ran the studios, was the rare showbiz Republican." He was unlike most other Jewish performers, who supported the losing Democratic candidate, John William Davis. Jolson however did, like some Republicans, publicly campaign for Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932. By 1936 he was back to supporting Republican Alf Landon and would not support another Democrat for president during his life.
Married life.
In 1906, while living in San Francisco, Jolson met dancer Henrietta Keller, and the two engaged in a year-long relationship before marrying in September 1907. In 1918, however, Henrietta—tired of what she reputedly considered his womanizing and refusal to come home after shows—filed for divorce. In 1920, Jolson began a relationship with Broadway actress Alma Osbourne (known professionally as Ethel Delmar); the two were married in August 1922. Alma divorced Jolson in 1928.
Ruby Keeler.
In the summer of 1928, Jolson met tap dancer, and later successful actress, Ruby Keeler at Texas Guinan's night club and was dazzled by her on sight; at the club, the two danced together. Three weeks later, Jolson saw a production of George M. Cohan's "Rise of Rosie O'Reilly", and noticed she was in the show's cast. Now knowing she was going about her Broadway career, Jolson attended another one of her shows, "Show Girl", and rose from the audience and engaged in her duet of "Liza". After this moment, the show's producer, Florenz Ziegfeld, asked Jolson to join the cast and continue to sing duets with Keeler. Jolson accepted Ziegfeld's offer and during their tour with Ziegfeld, the two started dating and were married on September 21, 1928. In 1935, Al and Ruby adopted a son, whom they named "Al Jolson Jr." In 1939, however—despite a marriage that was considered to be more successful than his previous ones—Keeler left Jolson, and later married John Homer Lowe, with whom she would have four children and remain married until his death in 1969.
Erle Galbraith.
In 1944, while giving a show at a military hospital in Hot Springs, Arkansas, Jolson met a young X-ray technologist, Erle Galbraith. Jolson became fascinated by her and—over a year after meeting—was able to track her down and hired her as an actress while he served as a producer at Columbia Pictures. After Jolson, whose health was still scarred from his previous battle with malaria, was hospitalized in the winter of 1945, Erle visited him and the two quickly began a relationship. They were married on March 22, 1945. During their marriage, the Jolsons adopted two children, Asa Jr. (born 1948) and Alicia (born 1949), and remained married until his death in 1950.
After a year and a half of marriage, his new wife had actually never seen him perform in front of an audience, and the first occasion came unplanned. As told by actor comedian Alan King, it happened during a dinner by the New York Friars' Club at the Waldorf Astoria in 1946, honoring the career of Sophie Tucker. Jolson and his wife were in the audience along with a thousand others, and George Jessel was emcee. He asked Al, privately, to perform at least one song. Jolson replied, "No, I just want to sit here." Then later, without warning, during the middle of the show, Jessel says, "Ladies and gentlemen, this is the easiest introduction I ever had to make. The world's greatest entertainer, Al Jolson." King recalls what happened next:
Closeness with his brother Harry.
Despite their close relationship growing up, Harry did show some disdain for Al's success over the years. Even during their time with Jack Palmer, Al was rising in popularity while Harry was fading. After separating from Al and Jack, Harry's career in show business, however, sank greatly. On one occasion—which was another factor in his on-off relationship with Al—Harry offered to be Al's agent, but Al rejected the offer, worried about the pressure that he would have faced from his producers for hiring his brother as his agent. Shortly after Harry's wife Lillian died in 1948, Harry and Al became close once again.
Death and commemoration.
The dust and dirt of the Korean front, from where he had returned a few weeks earlier, had settled in his right lung and he was close to exhaustion. While playing cards in his suite at the St. Francis Hotel at 335 Powell Street in San Francisco, Jolson collapsed and died of a massive heart attack on October 23, 1950. His last words were said to be "Boys, I'm going." He was 64.
After his wife received the news of his death by phone, she went into shock, and required family members to stay with her. At the funeral, police estimated upwards of 20,000 people showed up, despite threatened rain. It became one of the biggest funerals in show business history. Celebrities paid tribute: Bob Hope, speaking from Korea via short wave radio, said the world had lost "not only a great entertainer, but also a great citizen." Larry Parks said that the world had "lost not only its greatest entertainer, but a great American as well. He was a casualty of the war." Scripps-Howard newspapers drew a pair of white gloves on a black background. The caption read, "The Song Is Ended."
Newspaper columnist and radio reporter Walter Winchell said,
Friend George Jessel said during part of his eulogy,
He was interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. According to "Cemetery Guide", Jolson’s widow purchased a plot at Hillside and commissioned his mausoleum to be designed by well-known black architect Paul Williams. The six-pillar marble structure is topped by a dome, next to a three-quarter-size bronze statue of Jolson, eternally resting on one knee, arms outstretched, apparently ready to break into another verse of “Mammy”. The inside of the dome features a huge mosaic of Moses holding the tablets containing the Ten Commandments, and identifies Jolson as “The Sweet Singer of Israel” and “The Man Raised Up High”. On the day he died, Broadway dimmed its lights in Jolson's honor, and radio stations all over the world were paying tributes. Soon after his death, the BBC presented a special program entitled "Jolson Sings On". His death unleashed tributes from all over the world, including a number of eulogies from friends, including George Jessel, Walter Winchell, and Eddie Cantor. He contributed millions to Jewish and other charities in his will.
In October, 2008, a new documentary film, "Al Jolson and The Jazz Singer", premiered at the 50th Lübeck Nordic Film Days, Lübeck, Germany, and won 1st Prize at an annual film competition in Kiel
a few weeks later. In November, 2007, a similar documentary, "A Look at Al Jolson", was winner at the same festival. Jolson's music remains very popular today both in America and abroad with numerous CDs in print.
Jolson has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame:
In 2000, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.
Forty-four years after Jolson's death, the United States Postal Service honored him by issuing a postage stamp. The 29-cent stamp was unveiled by Erle Jolson Krasna, Jolson's fourth wife, at a ceremony in New York City's Lincoln Center on September 1, 1994. This stamp was one of a series honoring popular American singers, which included Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, Ethel Merman, and Ethel Waters. And in 2006, Jolson had a street in New York named after him with the help of the Al Jolson Society. 
Legacy and influence.
According to music historians Bruce Crowther and Mike Pinfold: "During his time he was the best known and most popular all-around entertainer America (and probably the world) has ever known, captivating audiences in the theatre and becoming an attraction on records, radio, and in films. He opened the ears of white audiences to the existence of musical forms alien to their previous understanding and experience ... and helped prepare the way for others who would bring a more realistic and sympathetic touch to black musical traditions." Black songwriter Noble Sissle, in the 1930s, said "e was always the champion of the Negro songwriter and performer, and was first to put Negroes in his shows". Of Jolson's
"Mammy" songs, he adds, "with real tears streaming down his blackened face, he immortalized the Negro motherhood of America as no individual could."

Pomona Envisions the Future

Pomona Envisions the Future is a mural created through a community-based project named "Envisioning the Future" (E.T.F), which took place in the Pomona Arts Colony from 2002 to 2004 and included over 80 artists. The mural is 140' x 42' acrylic on prepared concrete substrate on the west side of the Union Block building. It consists of four walls at right angles to each other. The Envisioning the Future project was led by artist Judy Chicago, photographer Donald Woodman and Cal Poly Pomona. The mural was painted by lead artist and mural project facilitator Kevin Stewart-Magee, and Envisioning the Future artists/participants Lief Frederick, Sandra Gallegos, Cori Griffin-Ruiz, Rupert Hernandez, Lynne Kumra, Yolanda Londono, Amy Runyen, Chris Toovey, Mary Kay Wilson, Erin Campbell, Athena Hahn, Joy McAllister and Fred Stewart-Magee. Artists Magu (Gilbert Luján) and Judy Baca consulted on the project. Cheryl Bookout was the Envisioning the Future project coordinator.
Susan Krieg led the painting effort.
It depicts the history of the City of Pomona from its pre-European past, through its agricultural and industrial ages into its bright future which restores the land in balance with humans. The mural was restored and finally finished in 2008 with funds from the City of Pomona Board of Parking Place Commissioners. A bronze plaque from the Downtown Pomona Owners Association was added on October 4, 2008 at the re-dedication ceremony. The mural is located at the intersection of Thomas and Second Streets in downtown Pomona, California in the Pomona Arts Colony.
Description.
The main wall of the E.T.F. mural is 140 feet wide by 42 feet high. There are four individual contiguous walls. The under painting of this mural coincides with the colors of the stained concrete walkway in the Thomas St. Plaza. It begins by depicting the pre-European landscape with the indigenous Tongva people in the dark sepia color palette. The image of a by-gone natural open landscape rounds the corner (north to south, right to left), and transitions into the historic past of rolling hills and open land erased and replaced by the familiar citrus groves established by the first European settlers. The color palette remains a restrained monochromatic blue-green. This is atypical of the traditional portrait of time as depicted in the multitudes of idyllic brightly colored packing house labels. Instead the muted colors signal the coming Industrial Revolution and environmental dark days to come. As a locomotive approaches the end of the first section of the wall the landscape ends in trees that wrap around the corner of the reveal wall and the narrative picks up with a nod to Mexican muralists shown as a Diego Rivera influenced trompe l'oeil relief of laborers supporting a bowl containing the fruits of labor. The trompe l'oeil figures take on a formalist "x" configuration representing the indomitable strength of labor. The fruit bowl contains varieties of fruit that were traditionally harvested by predominately Latino migrant workers.
At the reveal wall recesses to the main wall the decline of the citrus industry is represented by dead citrus trees that stop abruptly with the landscape at the twenty-four foot figure of the Goddess Pomona, the city's namesake. Pomona, originally the Roman Goddess of orchards, was selected as the contest-winning name for the city in the late 19th century. The Goddess' likeness traditionally has been more western European. The Goddess in the E.T.F. mural has been given a more pan-Latin appearance to coincide with the city's cultural demographics. Specifically, the model for the goddess is Chicano and is an instructor at the local charter high school. The Goddess's arms are outstretched as doves leave her hands in flight towards a hopeful future. The background behind the goddess figure is turbulent, murky and orangey-brown. The landscape turns to a congested urban-suburban sprawl of industrial pollution and over crowded housing tracts. As the narrative moves along to the right, mountains and blue sky emerge from the bleak present and the misty outskirts of a glowing city at the portal of a new age. In the foreground is a school of the future. Students are seated on a luminous ring or "learning circle" which hovers over serene and lush rolling hills in an environment that has been restored to near primordial conditions. In the distance is a vision which is millions of years away from the actual event, the galaxy Andromeda is seen in the morning sky as it approaches our own Milky Way.
Throughout the mural along the bottom is an undulating wave representing subterranean strata. The wave contains artifacts and objects that represent the ages up to a time where the human species has achieved balanced health and harmony, with a vision of the future which encompasses the universe.
Process.
Most of the people seen in the mural are local residents from the Pomona area. Many of the people sitting around the ring are friends and family of the artists. 
The mural was left unfinished in 2004 due to financial and political issues. It was finally cleaned, finished and clear coated in late 2008 before the rededication ceremony.

Carols in the Domain

Carols in the Domain is an annual Christmas concert event held in the Domain Gardens in Sydney. It began in 1983. It is broadcast around Australia on the Seven Network and simulcast on Smooth FM. The free event is held on the last Saturday before Christmas, and has become one of Australia's largest free Christmas events.
In 2013, Carols in the Domain was held on Saturday 21 December. It was presented by Matt White and Melissa Doyle. It is estimated to draw about fifty thousand people although previous Carols events have brought over a hundred thousand.
It is a major supporter of The Salvation Army's OASIS Youth Support Network.
History.
Carols in the Domain was started by Robyn Anne Hobbs, who observed Christmas carol events in Australia and wanted to develop one for Sydney. In an article with the "Sydney Morning Herald", she said "I suppose I started Carols in the Domain from a purely selfish point of view because I'm an only child and Christmas and birthdays were always wonderful occasions to celebrate and yet Sydney didn't really have a major Christmas celebration." She had worked with Qantas and chose The Salvation Army as the charity. The first Carols event was held in 1983 and was attended by 15,000 people.
Hobbs was awarded an Order of Australia Medal (OAM - General Division) in 2009 for services to the community in founding Carols in the Domain and her fundraising efforts for the Salvation Army
The main sponsor is designated with Naming Rights. In 1989, the main sponsor was Esso. In 1996, the main sponsor was Pacific Power, however, because the government had split up the company, they could not fund the sponsorship, but the state government stepped in to sponsor the event, pledging over AUS$300,000. The event was televised for the first time to New Zealand on TVNZ and Southeast Asia on Australia Television. The Sydney Morning Herald also became a sponsor for the event.
In 1997, the naming rights sponsor was RAMS Home Loans. In 2004, the event was called "The Good Guys Good Kid Carols in the Domain". In 2005, the naming rights were assumed to be The Good Guys again, but Woolworths acquired the naming rights and renamed the event to "Woolworths Carols in the Domain", and has retained the name since.
Charity.
Carols in the Domain supports both The Salvation Army and The Salvation Army OASIS Youth Support Network through the sale of candle bags during the performance. Oasis seeks to assist homeless youths aged between 16-24 in the inner city of Sydney with emergency housing, case management and training.
Major Sponsors.

US-1 Trucks

In 1981 Tyco Toys began selling HO scale, or 1/87 scale slot trucks. Similar to HO Scale racing sets, it had two lane track with various lengths and shapes available, and, unlike its racing counterparts, the vehicles traveled in the normal fashion employed on American roads. As to suit the driving style, the controllers were not hand-held, but were intended to resemble the dashboard of a truck, with a steering wheel (to control the speed) and a shifter mounted to the side (to control the direction). Some trucks pulled trailers, some (like the dump truck) did not. The line was unique because of the ability to pick up and deliver the loads, doing so with help from various accessories including a pipe loader, and a gravel loader, all without intervention from the operator.
The trucks were produced until 1986.

Robert Charleton (justice)

His Worship Sir Robert Charleton SL JP (d. 1395/6) was an English Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and a member of several parliaments.
Biography.
Charleton is first recorded in July 1375, when he was made a commissioner of the peace for Wiltshire and Somerset; from here on his appointments were spread over much of England, including a September 1377 investigation in Wiltshire examining men who claimed to be exempt from work under the Domesday Book, one of three investigations created as a response to the surge of peasant unrest in Wiltshire, Devon and Surrey due to the 'great rumour'. When the Peasants' Revolt broke out in 1381 Charleton was one of the justices tasked in June 1381 of punishing rebels in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, and was appointed to a similar commission in March 1382, this time just for Gloucestershire, tasked with punishing rebels and also breaking up large gatherings of peasants with the county militia.
In January 1383 he was appointed a Serjeant-at-law, and from this point served regularly on commissions of Assize and gaol delivery, continuing to be appointed to commissions of the peace and similar in Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Shropshire. In November 1385 he was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Herefordshire, Oxfordshire, Bristol and Wiltshire, and in August 1386 he served on a commission of the peace in Staffordshire, as well as another one in June 1384 investigating the state of embankments in the Thames Valley. On 30 January 1388 Charleton was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; a remarkable achievement considering he had no previous experience in the Court of Common Pleas.
Charleton is not known to have been close to the Lords Appellant, who at that point controlled the government, but he was apparently close to William of Wykeham, which is the most likely explanation for his unexpected promotion. Charleton managed to stay relatively safe in the difficult early half of 1388; despite, due to his position, being involved in the Merciless Parliament which executed most of Richard II's court and senior advisers, but when Richard reasserted his authority in May 1389 Charleton was made a Knight banneret.
Charleston attended at least seven of the eight Parliaments between February 1388 and January 1395, with the records for that in September 1388 not surviving, and on each occasion served as a Trier of Petitions. He served actively as Chief Justice until Michaelmas 1395, dying some time between 12 November 1395 and 15 January 1396, when his successor as Chief Justice was appointed.

Alpha-1-microglobulin

Alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M, α1-microglobulin, sometimes also called Protein HC) is a microglobulin, a small globular protein. It is found in all vertebrates, including humans, and is distributed in blood plasma and extravascular tissues of all organs. It is synthesized in most cells of the body, but mainly in the liver from a gene that codes for the alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor.
Structure.
Human A1M is composed of a 183-amino-acid peptide carrying three carbohydrate chains. It belongs to a protein family, the lipocalins, all members of which are shaped as a basket built from eight beta-strands of the peptide chain. A cysteine residue on one of the loops at the open end of the basket is of central importance for the function.
Function.
A1M binds and degrades heme, is a radical scavenger as well as a reductase. A model has been proposed in which A1M is described as a circulating “waste bin” which continuously removes free radicals and oxidizing agents, particularly heme, from the tissues. It is subsequently transported to the kidneys, where it is broken down. The protein is therefore believed to protect cells and tissues against the damage that is induced by abnormally high concentrations of free hemoglobin and/or reactive oxygen species (also called “oxidative stress”). 
A1M is also immunoregulatory: the immune response of lymphocytes and neutrophils is partly suppressed by A1M.
Role in diagnosis.
A1M can be used as an indicator of proteinuria. The test can be regarded as positive when the ratio of A1M (in milligrams) and creatinine in millimoles in the urine is over 0.7 mg/mmol.
A test for preeclampsia, where A1M serves as the diagnostic marker, has been proposed. It is based upon the fact that oxidative stress in the placenta tissue triggers the endogenous synthesis and plasma concentration of the protein.
Therapeutic potential.
A1M is a candidate for a number of therapeutic applications which includes the treatment or alleviation of preeclampsia, tissue damage caused by bleeding in brain, and chronic leg ulcers.

Alan Hunt (born 1925 Aston, England - died 2 February 1957) was an international motorcycle speedway rider who qualified for the Speedway World Championship final four times.
Career.
Hunt attended Tiger Stevensons training school in the winter of 1946-47 and impressed so much he was given the reserve berth with the Cradley Heath Cubs for the 1947 season who were competing in the National League Division Three. After his fourth season with the Heathens, Hunt was averaging over ten points per meeting and it was not surprising that he was attracting the attention of top flight teams. 
In 1951, the Harringay Racers thought they had a deal with the Heathens to sign Hunt on a full transfer but at the last moment the Birmingham Brummies promotion took over the Heathens and transferred Hunt to them.
In his first season at Birmingham he qualified for the World Final but only manage two points. It signalled the start of his dislike of the Wembley track although it was similar to the Cradley Heath track he learnt his speedway skills on. 
Hunt was also selected to ride for England, the highlight being a six ride, six win maximum against Australia in 1956.
Death.
On 1 February 1957 Hunt was riding in a meeting in South Africa, where he was planning on emigrating and only living in the UK during the speedway season, when he fell and was hit by the machine of the following rider, fracturing his skull. He was rushed to hospital but died in the early hours of 2 February. He was only thirty one years old.

Lorraine, Virginia

Lorraine was an unincorporated community in Henrico County, Virginia.
Lorraine was named for Edward Lorraine who was the 19th century chief engineer of the James River and Kanawha Canal. According to the Library of Virginia, he was born in 1818. In 1842, he first worked as a rod man doing surveying work on the James River and Kanawha Canal, beginning a career of over 30 years. He was promoted to assistant engineer, and finally appointed chief engineer of the canal succeeding Walter Gwynn. Lorraine served in this position until his death from smallpox in December 1872. 
Lorraine became a station stop of the Richmond and Allegheny Railroad which was built on the defunct canal's right-of-way in the 1880s. Soon after completion, the railroad was acquired by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. It became a major conduit for transportation of coal from southern West Virginia to the coal pier on the harbor of Hampton Roads at Newport News. Almost 100 years later, the line became the James River line of CSX Transportation, and still sees a heavy volume eastbound coal traffic .
Once a moderately busy passenger and freight station on the railroad, Lorraine was discontinued by the C&O in the mid 20th century.

Over the next three years, Coetzer notched a dozen victories; including wins against Larry Frazier, Eddie "Young Joe Louis" Taylor, and Alfredo Evangelista. He then faced Puerto Rican Ossie Ocasio, who had won the , and who had defeated boxers such as Jimmy Young, Dwight Muhammad Qawi, and Robbie Williams. On 6 March 1988, they had their first match at the Good Hope Centre in Cape Town. Ocasio won the ten-round bout on points, which gave Coetzer his first loss since the South African Heavyweight Title. However, after defeating Tim Anderson (USA) and Manoel De Almeida (Brazil), Coetzer faced Ocasio in a rematch at the Standard_Bank_Arena#Standard Bank Indoor Arena, and won the ten-round bout on points. He also won his rematch bout with Bernard Benton on 28 September 1987, when he knocked him out in the first round.
After six more wins, Coetzer faced local heavyweight Johnny du Plooy, who had won 196 of his 200 amateur fights, and who had scored 17 knockouts in his first 20 professional fights. They met on 4 August 1990 at the Sun City , in a bout billed “Once and For All.” Du Plooy cut Coetzer with his first right punch, and had him down towards the end of the first round, but Coetzer dropped Du Plooy twice in the second round and won the fight by TKO.
Coetzer went on to earn a number-one contender spot for Evander Holyfield's IBF world title, but was made to fight a WBA Heavyweight Title Eliminator, scheduled for 12 rounds, against the number-two contender, Riddick Bowe. The bout took place on 18 July 1992 in Las Vegas, Nevada. During the fight, Bowe was ahead in scoring, although Coetzer disagreed. In the sixth round, Bowe hit Coetzer below the belt, for which the referee Mills Lane had deducted a point. In the seventh round, Bowe hit Coetzer with what appeared to be a right-handed low blow. Coetzer turned away, and anticipated that Lane would warn Bowe, however, he left his hands down, and Bowe delivered a jolting right uppercut. Bowe then followed with a left and right that drove Coetzer into the ropes, which caused Lane to step in and end the match with a TKO. "It definitely shouldn't have been stopped," said Coetzer. "It was a low blow."
Coetzer fought Frank Bruno from London, England. The referee stopped the fight in the eighth round and Bruno was awarded a TKO. His final career bout was against George Foreman; he was knocked down briefly in the fourth round, but eventually lost by TKO when he was knocked again in the eighth.

Fenor GAA

Fenor GAA is a Gaelic Athletic Association club based in the small east Waterford, Ireland village of Fenor. The club enters teams in both Gaelic football and hurling each year, both of which compete in their respective junior championships.
Fenor's greatest achievement was winning the Waterford Senior Football Championship in 1932. Fenor also collected countless junior hurling titles in 90's and 00's but they never gained promotion to intermediate status.
Fenor4Junior is Fenor GAA's version of "The American Dream". It was set up in 2010 to instil the belief that Fenor could go all the way in the Waterford Junior Hurling Championship for the first time in the club's history. However, a number of poor performances that year caused the dream to be shattered. In 2011, a large number of injuries, along with exams and retirements, meant Fenor made no impact on the championship. The belief has spread to many places near and far; Tramore CBS have numerous 'Fenor4Junior' Tipp-Ex markings in many classrooms and on many chairs. The common phrase can also be heard by a number of touists in Fenor's hinterland during the summer months.

Alan Knicely

Alan Lee Knicely (born May 19, 1955) is a former professional baseball catcher. He played all or part of eight seasons in Major League Baseball from 1979 until 1986. He served mainly as a backup catcher for four different teams during that time, while also playing some first base and outfield.
Playing career.
Astros organization.
Early career.
Knicely was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 3rd round of the 1974 Major League Baseball Draft as a pitcher. He slowly moved up through their farm system as far as Double-A, reaching that level in 1977. After going 1–5 with an ERA over 5 with the Columbus Astros, his conversion to a position player commenced. The next season, back at Columbus, he played mostly shortstop, but by 1979 he was playing mostly behind the plate.
1979: Breakout season.
Knicely played for Coumbus once again in 1979, and he put up prodigious offensive numbers, hitting 33 home runs and batting .289. He shared the Southern League Most Valuable Player award with fellow Astros prospect Danny Heep, and for that he was rewarded with a taste of the big leagues. Knicely saw action in seven games down the stretch, mostly as a pinch hitter, but also playing parts of three games at catcher and one at third base. However, he went 0-for-6 at the plate.
Early 1980s with the Astros.
Knicely was bumped up a level for the 1980 season, playing for the Triple-A Tucson Toros. He continued to hit well, batting .318 with 105 RBI, but the Astros had Alan Ashby and Luis Pujols ahead of him, and Knicely's defense was not up to par. He was called up once again in September, but his action was limited to a single pinch-hitting appearance.
In 1981, it was back to the Triple-A Toros for Knicely. His defense improved, as he cut his errors in half, and he once again had a good season with the bat, hitting .306 with 96 RBI. Once again, however, major league time would wait until September's roster expansion. On September 17, he got his first major league hit, a single against John Urrea of the San Diego Padres. Even then, he did not appear in another game until the final two games of the season. Given a chance, he went 4-for-6 in those two games, with a pair of solo home runs.
Finally, in 1982, Knicely would break camp with the big club, making the roster out of spring training as a right-handed hitter off the bench for the Astros. While Ashby and Pujols were still seeing the lion's share of the playing time at catcher, Knicely played 23 games there as well as 17 in the outfield. Unfortunately for Alan, his minor league batting prowess did not translate to success in the major leagues, as he batted just .188 with 2 home runs in 133 at bats. The following spring, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for a pair of prospects, reliever Bill Dawley and outfielder Tony Walker.
Mid-1980s with the Reds.
Like 1982, Knicely spent all of 1983 in the major leagues. With Johnny Bench winding down his career as a third baseman, the Reds employed three catchers that season, and Knicely was the third, behind Dann Bilardello and Alex Treviño. Playing in 59 games, Knicely improved his batting average, but only up to .224. He again hit just 2 home runs in 98 at bats.
After a second disappointing season, Knicely would open the 1984 season back in the minor leagues, this time with the Wichita Aeros of the American Association. In what proved to be the Aeros' final season, Knicely showed that he still had no difficulty mastering minor league pitching. He batted .333 with 33 home runs and 126 RBI in winning the AA's Most Valuable Player award, his second such award in the minors. For his efforts, he was named Minor League Player of the Year by The Sporting News, and was given another chance by the Reds that September. However, he managed just four hits in 29 at bats, although he did drive in five runs.
In 1985, Knicely got yet another chance. The Reds, tired of Bilardello's lack of hitting ability, sent the light-hitting catcher to the minors and brought Knicely back to the majors to split time behind the plate with Dave Van Gorder. Knicely responded by setting career bests in most categories, including a .253 batting average, 5 home runs, and 26 RBI. All this earned him, however, was an August trade to the Philadelphia Phillies for veteran catcher Bo Díaz. The Phillies shipped Knicely back to the minors, calling him up for just 7 hitless at bats in September.
Later career.
Knicely was released by the Phillies the following spring. Four days later, he joined the St. Louis Cardinals, once again starting the season in the minor leagues. He was called up to the majors in June to play first base as part of an attempt to fill in for the injured Jack Clark. In 34 games, Knicely batted just .195 with a single home run and 6 RBI. He was released on October 31, and after a season in the minor leagues with the Texas Rangers organization, Knicely retired at age 32.

Viola betonicifolia

Viola betonicifolia, commonly known as the Arrowhead Violet, Showy Violet or Mountain Violet, is a small perennial herbaceous shrub of the "Viola", which contains pansies and violets. It occurs from India and Pakistan in southern Asia throughout eastern Australia and Tasmania. It grows in shaded habitat in forests.
Taxonomy.
"Viola betonicifolia" was originally described by English botanist Sir James Edward Smith in 1817. 
Description.
This species is distinguished by long, slender arrow-shaped leaves grow from the base of the plant, which has no stem as such, and are up to 6 cm (2.4 in) long with a v-shaped sinus at the base, and are usually rather bright, fresh green. Its striking bright purple flowers are 1-1.5 cm in diameter and occur in spring and summer.
Flowers are followed by small pale brown pods with tiny blackish seeds.
Distribution and habitat.
"Viola betonicifolia" is found in Tasmania and eastern mainland Australia from South Australia through Victoria and New South Wales, and into Queensland. It also occurs in Asia westwards to India and Pakistan. It grows in shady areas in forest.
Ecology.
The caterpillars of the Laced or Indian Fritillary ("Argynnis hyperbius") feed upon this plant, and the flowers are pollinated by the Large- or Common Grass Yellow ("Eurema hecabe"). Coastal swamps where "Viola betonicifolia" grows have been drained in New South Wales, endangering the status of the Laced fritillary in that state.
Cultivation.
"Viola betonicifolia" is an easy plant to grow, and adaptable to different soil types as long as it get sufficient moisture and at least half shade or more in a garden situation. It is good for rockeries. It can be quite vigorous in heavier, moisture retentive soils and forms clumps to about 30 cm (12 in) diameter. It is self-seeding.

Protodioscin is a steroidal saponin compound found in a number of plant species, most notably in the "Tribulus", "Trigonella" and "Dioscorea" families. It is best known as the putative active component of the herbal aphrodisiac plant "Tribulus terrestris". 
Extracts from "T. terrestris" standardised for protodioscin content have been demonstrated to produce proerectile effects in isolated tissues and aphrodisiac action in several animal species. The mechanism for these effects has not been clearly established, and while protodioscin has been demonstrated to trigger release of nitric oxide in corpus cavernosum tissue, and also to produce statistically significant increases in the levels of the hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone in animal studies, but studies in humans have failed to show efficacy and its use remains controversial.

List of German wine regions

German wine regions are classified according to the quality category that the wine falls into - "Tafelwein, Landwein, Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete" (QbA) and "Prädikatswein". The wine regions allowed to produce QbA and Prädikatswein are further subdivided into four categories, in descending order of size - "Anbaugebiet" (a major wine region), "Bereich" (a district within the wine region), "Großlage" (a collection of vineyards within a district) and "Einzellage" (a single vineyard). A small number "Einzellagen" do not belong to a "Großlage" and are called "großlagenfrei", but all belong to a Bereich and Anbaugebiet.
The 13 major wine regions ("Anbaugebiete") are Ahr, Baden, Franconia, Hessische Bergstraße, Mittelrhein, Mosel, Nahe, Palatinate, Rheingau, Rheinhessen, Saale-Unstrut, Saxony, and Württemberg. With the exceptions of Saxony and Saale-Unstrut, most of Germany's major wine regions are located in the western part of the country. As of 2010, there were 41 "Bereiche", 160 "Großlagen" and 2,632 "Einzellagen".

<doc id="19564541" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19564541" title="Glutamate-glutamine cycle">
Glutamate-glutamine cycle

In biochemistry, the glutamate-glutamine cycle is a sequence of events by which an adequate supply of the neurotransmitter glutamate is maintained in the central nervous system. Neurons are not able to perform new synthesis of the neurotransmitter glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from glucose. Discoveries of glutamine and glutamate pools within intercellular compartments led to suggestions of the glutamate-glutamine cycle working between neurons and astrocytes. The glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle is a metabolic pathway that describes the release of glutamate or GABA from neurons and then taken up into astrocytes(star shaped glial cells). In return, astrocytes release glutamine to be taken up into neurons for use as a precursor to the synthesis of glutamate or GABA. 
Production.
Glutamate.
Initially, in a glutamatergic synapse, the neurotransmitter glutamate is released from the neurons and is taken up into the synaptic cleft. Glutamate resident in the synapse must then be removed rapidly. There are three possibilities, as follows: 
Postsynaptic neurons remove little glutamate from the synapse. There is active reuptake into presynaptic neurons, but this mechanism appears to be less important than astrocytic transport. Astrocytes could dispose of transported glutamate in two ways. They could export it to blood capillaries, which about the astrocyte foot processes. However, this strategy would result in a net loss of carbon and nitrogen from the system. An alternate approach would be to convert glutamate into another compound, preferably a non-neuroactive species. The advantage of this approach is that neuronal glutamate could be restored without the risk of trafficking the transmitter through extracellular fluid, where glutamate would cause neuronal depolarization. The latter approach appears to have been favored by evolutionary processes. Astrocytes readily convert glutamate to glutamine via the glutamine synthetase pathway and released into the extracellular space. The glutamine is taken into the presynaptic terminals and metabolized into glutamate by the phosphate-activated glutaminase (a mitochondrial enzyme). The glutamate that is synthesized in the presynaptic terminal is packaged into synaptic vesicles by the transporter VGLUT, also known as glutamate transporters. Once the vesicle is released, glutamate is removed from the synaptic cleft by excitatory amino-acid transporters (EAATs). This allows synaptic terminals and glial cells to work together in order to maintain a proper supply of glutamate.Glutamate can also be produced by transamination of 2-oxoglutarate, an intermediate in the Citric acid cycle. Recent electrophysiological evidence suggests that active synapses require presynaptically localized glutamine glutamate cycle to maintain excitatory neurotransmission. 
GABA.
At GABAergic synapses, the cycle is called the GABA-glutamine cycle. Here the glutamine taken up by neurons is converted to glutamate, which is then metabolized into GABA by glutamate decarboxylase. Upon release, GABA is taken up into astrocytes via GABA transporters and then catabolized into succinate by the joint actions of GABA transaminase and succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Glutamine is synthesized from succinate via the TCA cycle including a condensation reaction of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA forming citrate. After that, the synthesis of α-ketoglutarate and glutamate occurs. Glutamate is converted by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) to GABA. The supply of glutamine to GABAergic neurons is less significant, as these neurons exhibit a larger proportion of reuptake of the released neurotransmitter compared to their glutamatergic counterparts 
Ammonia Homeostasis.
One of the problems of both the Glutamate-Glutamine cycle and the GABA-Glutamine cycle is ammonia homeostasis. When one molecule of glutamate or GABA is converted to glutamine in the astrocytes, one molecule of ammonia is absorbed. Also, for each molecule of glutamate or GABA cycled into the astrocytes from the synapse, one molecule of ammonia will be produced in the neurons. This ammonia will obviously have to be transported out of the neurons and back into the astrocytes for detoxification, as an elevated ammonia concentration has detrimental effects on a number of cellular functions and can cause a spectrum of neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms (impaired memory, shortened attention span, sleep-wake inversions, brain edema, intracranial hypertension, seizures, ataxia and coma). 
Transportation & Detoxification.
This can basically happen in two different ways; ammonia itself might simply diffuse (as NH3) or be transported (as NH4+) across the cell membranes in and out of the extracellular space or a shuttle system involving carrier molecules (amino acids) might be employed. Certainly, ammonia can diffuse across lipid membranes and it has been shown that ammonia can be transported by K+/CI– co-transporters.
Amino Acid Shuttles and Transporting Ammonia.
As diffusion and transport of free ammonia across the cell membrane will affect the pH level of the cell, the more attractive and regulated way of transporting ammonia between the neuronal and the astrocytic compartment is via an amino acid shuttle, of which there are two: leucine and alanine. The amino acid moves in the opposite direction of glutamine. In the opposite direction of the amino acid a corresponding molecule transported; for alanine this molecule is lactate, and for leucine the molecule is α-ketoisocaproate.
Leucine.
The ammonia fixed in the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction in the neurons is transaminated into α-ketoisocaproate to form leucine, which is exported to the astrocytes. In the astrocytes, the process is reversed. α-Ketoisocaproate is transported in the other direction.
Alanine.
The ammonia produced in neurons is fixed into α-ketoglutarate by the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction to form glutamate. Then transaminated by alanine aminotransferase into lactate-derived pyruvate to form alanine which is exported to astrocytes. In the astrocytes this process is then reversed, and lactate is transported in the other direction.
Disorders and Conditions.
Numerous reports have been published indicating that the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle is affected in a variety of neurological disorders and conditions. Biopsies of sclerotic hippocampus tissue from human subjects suffering from epilepsy have shown decreased glutamate-glutamine cycling. Another pathology in which the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle might be compromised is Alzheimer's disease, NMR spectroscopy showed decreased glutamate neurotransmission activity and TCA cycling rate in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Hyperammonemia in the brain, typically occurring as a secondary complication of primary liver disease and known as hepatic encephalopathy, is a condition that has an impact on glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycling in the brain.
Potential Drug Targets.
In the treatment of epilepsy, drugs targeting both GABA transporters and the GABA metabolizing enzyme GABA-transaminase (vigabatrin) have been marketed, providing proof of principle for the neurotransmitter cycling systems as pharmacological targets. However, with regard to glutamate transport and metabolism no such drugs have been developed This is because glutamatergic synapses are abundant and the neurotransmitter glutamate is an important metabolite in metabolism, making interference capable of adverse effects. So far, most of the drug development directed at the glutamatergic system seems to have been focused on ionotropic glutamate receptors as pharmacological targets, although G-protein coupled receptors have been attracting increased attention over the years.

John F. Cotton Corporate Wellness Center

The John F. Cotton Corporate Wellness Center or John F. Cotton Hospital Center for Corporation Wellness, formerly known only as the John F. Cotton Hospital (JFCH), is a privately owned hospital located inside the compound of MERALCO, a major electric company in the Philippines. 
Being a private facility, it is situated inside the Meralco Center at Ortigas Avenue in Pasig City. The transformation of the JFCH into an integrated corporate wellness center made the Manila Electric Company the first corporation in the Philippines to institutionalize the implementation of such a program.
History.
Beginnings.
For 40 years since its conception as a private hospital, the John F. Cotton Hospital had been labeled as the healthcare custodian of Manila Electric Company employees. It was a tertiary hospital that catered medical and health care needs to employees. Its fair market value was estimated to be at P5,519,190 in March 2003.
Transformation.
The JFCH was formally transformed into a Corporate Wellness Center (CWC) on September 16, 2004 in order to continue securing the welfare and well being of Meralco’s 5,000 employees. The change was enacted by Manuel M. Lopez, the chairman and chief executive officer of Meralco, and was designed to prolong the vision of Lopez’s father, Eugenio Lopez, Sr. (first Filipino owner of Meralco), and is in line with the company's policy of securing the welfare and well-being of its personnel. The change also put into use a new concept in employee healthcare, which is preventive rather than curative. The edifice of the new Corporate Wellness Center was officially inaugurated on July 20, 2005.
Implementation.
The result of the implementation of the change resulted to the outsourcing of John F. Cotton Hospital’s in-patient services to The Medical City, a hospital in close proximity to the Meralco headquarters. This outsourcing of in-patient services to The Medical City, allowed the center to place more attention on preventive measures rather than curative programs, resulting to decreased health care costs and increase in company productivity. Despite the change, the center still focuses on medical services that include outpatient services and the promotion of healthy living among employees. The goals of the center also include the promotion of lifestyle changes, efficient health maintenance, and the provision of an integrated and holistic approach to total health care and promotion, which also covers nutrition, medical, physical, spiritual and social, and psychological and emotional aspects of employee wellness.
Facilities.
Its support facilities include diagnostic instruments, X-ray equipment, a clinical laboratory, a fitness center. In addition to this, the company itself operates 42 canteens throughout its franchise area. The current set-up as a corporate wellness center provides well-rounded healthcare program for Meralco’s staff which includes programs for occupational health disease prevention and control, wellness promotion and education. Its services are compartmentalized into three major areas: basic corporate health, corporate wellness, and corporate social responsibility.
Facilitators.
A core care team was formed and currently leads and coordinates the delivery of integrated wellness programs to employees. The physician who is currently in charge of the overall management and administration of the John F. Cotton center, including the provision of medical care, is Dr. Efren R. Vicaldo, who is also the head the Congenital Heart Disease section of the Philippine Heart Center and the Cardiology section of the FEU NRMF Medical Center. The medical director is Dr. Angelito P. Obillo, and another administrator is Dr. Rafael B. Agra.

Print-Painting

Print-Painting is a transfer painting technique developed by New York artist Sam Glankoff. 
Print-Painting.
New York artist, Sam Glankoff (1894–1982), developed an innovative transfer painting technique in the last decades of his life using principles of woodcut, printing and painting to make unique large multi-paneled works on Japanese paper. "Print-Painting," was the term advanced by Elke Solomon, former curator at The Whitney Museum of American Art, in 1974 when Glankoff described his technique as that of "using a printing method to make a painting." 
In the cover story for Print Review 20: Sam Glankoff and Print-Painting, Jeffrey Wechsler, Assistant Director of the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum, Rutgers University, and Marilyn Kushner, now Curator of Prints at the New York Historical Society, previously Print Curator at the Brooklyn Museum, state that “ Glankoff’s greatest contribution to contemporary art is that of creating and perfecting an art-making procedure that, while based on printmaking, can fairly safely be considered a new technique. 
Because of the nature of Glankoff’s method, it is difficult to place his late art within traditional categories of painting or printmaking. It is not difficult however, to contend that it is neither painting nor printing in the purest sense. Once Glankoff ceased to incise into the wood panels in the early 1970s his art no longer met the basic criteria of a woodcut. Because each piece is unique, it is tempting to classify his works as monotypes, yet there are several reasons why they cannot be so categorized. Once a monotype is printed, most of the initial design on the inked surface is obliterated. Usually only one impression (at most two or three) can be printed from a monotype surface. With Glankoff’s method, many impressions of the composition could be made without sacrificing the original design, because it was permanently affixed to the boards. Although each panel was approached as an original and the board was always re-inked, the essential fact is that the original image was never lost. Finally, Glankoff’s method is not painting. He did paint on to masonite boards and the texture of the brushstrokes was transferred to the paper, but Glankoff’s method remained an indirect process... By reason of the artist’s development of a complex methodology to produce specific visual effects otherwise unattainable, the process, now called “print-painting,” permits extremely rich color and, owing to the integration of (water soluble) pigment with (glycerine and casein), interesting textural qualities...This tremendous color saturation is achieved by multiple inkings and translucent overlays.”
"Like monotypes, they are unique transfer prints but, as in painting, there is an excessive importance associated with the application of the pigment," states David Kiehl, former Assistant Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York now Print Curator at The Whitney Museum of American Art. “Since the original image was never lost, Glankoff’s art transcends monotypes but remains nevertheless a printing process because the works were made using a transfer technique. They are printed paintings using the monotype method.”
"'Print-Painting' is really an invention of Glankoff's," writes Jeffrey Wechsler, curator of Sam Glankoff's museum retrospective exhibition held in 1984. "It's rather remarkable that in the late 20th century an artist could really come up with an entirely new technique. Certainly it was based on other techniques. But it had specific qualities and characteristics which Glankoff, through his great experience with the medium, realized had to come together in an entirely new form."

Musical Futures

Musical Futures is a movement to reshape music education - driven by teachers, for teachers. At its heart is a set of pedagogies that bring non-formal teaching and informal learning approaches into more formal contexts, to provide engaging, sustainable and relevant music making activities for all young people.
Background.
Funded and managed by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, the initial aim of Musical Futures was to devise new and imaginative ways of engaging young people, aged 11–19, in music activities. Following a year of consultation in 2003, the Paul Hamlyn Foundation identified the following objectives:
After inviting applications from consortia of local music education providers, three Pathfinder Local Authority Music Services – in Leeds, Nottingham and Hertfordshire - were commissioned to explore new approaches and structures which might ensure that more young people participate in better quality musical experiences for longer.
Learning models.
Informal Learning in the Music Classroom.
A programme of informal learning, drawing on the real-life learning practices of popular musicians, developed by Lucy Green, Institute of Education and Hertfordshire Music Service. It involves students in self-directed, independent learning, in friendship groups, working on a series of musical tasks.
The Whole Curriculum Approach.
A programme developed by Nottingham City Music Service that aims to develop school music beyond the classroom confines for Year 7-8 students, and involve them in real musical activity, in genuine musical situations and environments. It aims to draw together good practice from classroom, instrumental and extra-curricular music into an integrated package for students.
Personalising Extra-Curricular Learning.
An approach by Education Leeds Artforms to empower young people to make positive, informed choices about the music they engage with beyond the classroom.
All classroom resources for the Personalising Extra-Curricular Learning model can be downloaded from http://www.musicalfutures.org.uk/teachers_pack_leeds_resourcepack.html
NUMU.
NUMU is a safe online community for young people to showcase their music; collaborate, compete and develop their talent. Schools can join NUMU and establish their own school record label, and enable their students to create an online portfolio of work.
Who is Musical Futures for?
Musical Futures was initially designed for secondary schools, with a particular focus on 12–14 yr old students, as this has long been an age at which students seem to lose interest in music learning in school. However, teachers in primary and tertiary education have successfully adopted Musical Futures approaches. We have also seen these approaches tailored to work with students in challenging circumstances (for example students with special educational needs, or in Young Offenders Institutes and Pupil Referral Units).

Josh Keyes

Josh Keyes (born August 17, 1969 in Tacoma, Washington) is an American contemporary artist who makes paintings and prints. He currently works out of Portland, Oregon. His work has been described as "a satirical look at the impact urban sprawl has on the environment and surmises, with the aid of scientific slices and core samples, what could happen if we continue to infiltrate and encroach on our rural surroundings." 
Josh Keyes' style is reminiscent of the diagrammatic vocabulary found in scientific textbook illustrations that often express through a detached and clinical viewpoint an empirical representation of the natural world. Assembled into this virtual stage set are references to contemporary events along with images and themes from his personal mythology. Josh Keyes' work is a hybrid of eco-surrealism and dystopian folktales that express a concern for our time and the Earth's future. Josh Keyes was born in Tacoma, Washington. He received a BFA in 1992 from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and an MFA in 1998 from Yale University. Keyes currently lives and works in Portland Oregon.
Biography.
Keyes earned a bachelor's degree from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and a master's degree in painting and printmaking from Yale University.

Willam R. Belknap School

The Willam R. Belknap School is a former school building in the Belknap neighborhood of Louisville, Kentucky USA. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
It was designated as a local landmark by the Louisville Metro Landmarks Commission in 2001.
The school takes its name from the developer of the surrounding neighborhood. In 1995, the Belknap neighborhood association took a geometric motif from the school building for its logo.
Description.
The building and its grounds originally took up an entire city block. The building has about of indoor space.
The Belknap School is a two-story building on a raised basement. The building has a central projecting entry bay and projecting end wings. The central projecting entrance contains double doors with a single transom. The panes have geometric mullions. This entrance is encased in a stone surround with an arched tympanum lined with exaggerated dentils. Within the tympanum is a central lamp with the words "LUX ET VERITAS, light and truth," above an open book with a fig branch. In the lintel is a band of exaggerated dentils. In the stone surround; the school name, WILLIAM
R. BELKNAP SCHOOL, is located above the doors, flanked by applied decorative terra cotta motifs. 
On the second floor is a pair of windows with vertical mullions in both sash, and crosshatch mullions in the upper portion of the upper sash. Flanking the windows are applied, terra cotta torch motifs. The inside walls of this projecting bay contain three stepped windows on the first level and paired windows on the second with the flanking torch motifs. The fenestration of the recessed facade plane which flanks the entrance bay consists of five basement-story windows and five
windows on both the first and second floors.
The basement-story windows have six-over-six lights. A stone band divides the basement-story from the first floor. The first and second floor windows contain unusually patterned geometric lights. Pilasters rise from the sill of the first floor windows to the lintels of the second floor windows, with tapestry-like terra cotta panels on the pilasters between the second: floor windows.
A stone band divides the second floor from the large parapet wall with a stone coping. 
On the inside walls of each wing are three basement-story windows and two first and second floor windows with the same mullion patterns found on the recessed front facade windows. Applied tapestry-like panels are found on the second floor. The ends of the wings contain no fenestration and are the most decorative planes of the structure. The same tapestry-like panels found on the other facade planes are also located here, on both sides of a central, slightly recessed plane which contains banding and brickwork which comprise another tapestry-like design. The stone band which divides the basement-story from the first floor is interrupted by an elongated arch with a
medallion containing an old city of Louisville emblem. 
On every outside corner of the building at the parapet level is a band of exaggerated dentils with projecting ends. On the right side of the building is an entrance for the boys and on the left side is an entrance for the girls. The entrance is within a stone surround with the tapestry-like applied motifs on each side of the entrance. The name BOYS and GIRLS is located in the lintel. There are small paired windows above the entrance and another larger pair on the second level. The rest of the fenestration on the side walls of the building is the same as that found on the front. The windows on the rear of the building have nine-over-nine lights.
The polygonal smokestack contains some of the same decorative elements found on the school building. Every door knob on the interior is a bust of William R. Belknap. In 2000 a cellular antennae was added atop the smokestack, but was quickly altered to hide the antennae within the smokestack after neighbors complained.
It is not clear what material was used in the surrounds and applied motifs and banding on this building. It is terra cotta, stone or cement - most likely a combination of all three. Assumptions were made as to the material used in the context of the description. If and when terra cotta was used, it is unglazed.
Architecture.
The Belknap School is an example in Louisville of the eclectic styles of the early twentieth century. The craftsmanship displayed in the terra cotta ornamentation on the building's exterior make it one of the city's finest examples of Sullivanesque detailing.
The Belknap School was designed in an eclectic style. The plan is typical of the Neo-Elizabethan style schools of the period, but the decorative elements are both classical and Sullivanesque. The main entrance is ar example of the combination of the decorative motifs. Exaggerated dentils line the arched panel above the double doors. This panel also contains a lamp, symbolic of enlightenment, hope, window and truth, an open book, symbolic of intellectual attainment, and a fig branch from the tree of knowledge. The remaining elements are stylized foliate patterns, typical of Sullivanesque detailing.
The projecting end wings of the building also contain geometric and foliate stylized panels, described in a 1916 article from the Courier-Journal as tapestries.
History.
The Belknap School was the last of seven schools built with a local bond issue from
1914 to 1916. J. Earl Henry was architect for schools and also designed Louisville Male High School and Brandeis Elementary School, both of which are also on the National Register of Historic Places.
Henry was in partnership with Brinton B. Davis before becoming school architect, and assisted Davis in the plans for the Broadway School. Henry is known particularly for his use of classical and mythical symbolism, as well as his ingenuous eclectic designs. The Belknap School remained a neighborhood school until 1978 when it was closed. 
Jefferson County Public Schools sold the building to a private company which reopened the school building as office space in 1983. A portion was used by the Christian Academy of Louisville from 1994 to 1998. Vineyard Christian Church held services in the building in 2002 until 2006.
In 2006, the school building was converted into 20 condominium units. As a part of the plant, a new condo building was built on the school lot just south of the original building. The new building was built to roughly resemble the original building and have a similar footprint.

Angelo Oliviero Olivetti

Angelo Oliviero Olivetti (1874 – 17 November 1931) was an Italian lawyer, journalist, and political activist.
Olivetti was born in Ravenna, Italy. In 1892 while a student at the University of Bologna he joined the Italian Socialist Party. Following accusations of subversive activity, he fled to Switzerland in 1898. There he eventually met Benito Mussolini. Finding only limited support for his views within the socialist movement, in 1906 he began publishing "Pagine Libre", a journal devoted to revolutionary syndicalism. He was expelled from Switzerland in 1912.
On 5 October 1914, Olivetti published the manifesto of the "Fasci d'Azione rivoluzionaria internazionalista". Mussolini shortly thereafter joined and assumed leadership of this fascio.
In March 1925, Olivetti was one of only three Jewish speakers at the Congress of Fascist Culture. He joined the faculty of the University of Perugia in 1931 as professor of political science, and died soon after in Spoleto, Italy.
Revolutionary syndicalists like Olivetti sought to change society while preserving the nation. Mussolini combined this syndicalism with strains of nationalism into his fascism.

<doc id="19564847" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19564847" title="California Proposition 7 (2008)">
California Proposition 7 (2008)

California Proposition 7, would have required California utilities to procure half of their power from renewable resources by 2025. In order to make that goal, levels of production of solar, wind and other renewable energy resources would more than quadruple from their current output of 10.9%. It would also require California utilities to increase their purchase of electricity generated from renewable resources by 2% annually to meet Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements of 40% in 2020 and 50% in 2025. Current law AB32 requires an RPS of 20% by 2010.
The 42 page measure, 7 pages of which is new law, is an initiated state statute that had qualified for the November 2008 ballot in California, and was disapproved by voters on November 4 of that year.
Provisions in the initiative.
Estimated fiscal impact.
The California Legislative Analyst's Office, the nonpartisan state agency charged with providing a neutral estimate about the fiscal impact on the state of ballot initiatives and state legislative bills, has arrived at the following summary of Prop. 7's estimated costs:
Supporters.
The official committee supporting Prop 7 is called Californians for Solar and Clean Energy. 
For the full list of supporters, see: List of Proposition 7 supporters
Donors who support Prop. 7.
The primary financial backer of the initiative is Peter Sperling. 
As of September 18, two donors have contributed $5,000 or more to support Prop. 7. They are:
Campaign consultants.
Jim Gonzalez, founding partner of the political consulting firm Jim Gonzalez & Associates in Sacramento, is the initiative's chief spokesperson.
Opponents.
The official committee opposing Prop. 7 is called Californians Against Another Costly Energy Scheme. 
See also: List of Proposition 7 opponents.
Donors who oppose Prop. 7.
As of August 2, three donors are listed as having given $5,000 or more to defeat this initiative. They are:
Campaign consultants.
The opposition coalition as of July 14, 2008 had paid about $175,000 to the campaign consulting firm of Townsend, Raimundo, Besler & Usher.
Polling information.
A poll released on July 22, 2008 by Field Poll showed Proposition 7 with 63% support and 24% opposition. 82% of those surveyed had no initial awareness of Proposition 7.
Path to the ballot.
The petition drive to qualify the measure for the ballot was conducted by Progressive Campaigns, Inc. at a cost of $1.367 million.
Lawsuits over ballot language.
Supporters and opponents of Proposition 7 filed lawsuits in Sacramento Superior Court regarding the wording of ballot arguments that voters will see in the official voter's guide.
The lawsuit filed by proponents of Proposition 7 claimed that the opposition’s ballot arguments contained false and misleading statements that should have been deleted. Specifically, proponents sued over the opponents' claim that small renewable providers would be shut out of the market. Noting that there is no language in the measure that states that, Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Michael Kenny refused to take sides on the issue.
The lawsuit filed by opponents of Proposition 7 wanted the removal of three statements in the voter's guide:
The opponent's petition was denied in its entirety, with Judge Kenny stating that the opponents had not sufficiently established that those statements were misleading.
Greenwashing.
The campaign against Proposition 7 has drawn questions about the ties between Pacific Gas & Electric, Sempra, and Southern Cal Edison, and the main environmental groups that have come out against the measure. Articles from the late nineties and 2000-2001 linking the Natural Resources Defense Council to the passage of electricity deregulation, leading to the energy crisis over which Governor Gray Davis was recalled, have resurfaced, leading some to question the veracity of the environmental opposition.[http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/2003Q3/enviros.html. Still more question the independence of groups like the CA League of Conservation Voters (CLVC), the Sierra Club,and Acterra, which have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from either the utilities funding the No on Prop 7 campaign or other major energy companies, and have overlapping board memberships with the utilities.[http://confusedinsolarcalifornia.blogspot.com/2008/08/ca-league-of-conservation-voters.html 
Opponents to Proposition 7 deflect the charge of greenwashing by pointing to the California Green Party's opposition.[http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/cnoble/prop_7_is_bad_for_renewable_en.html]

Health information technology

Health information technology (HIT) provides the umbrella framework to describe the comprehensive management of health information across computerized systems and its secure exchange between consumers, providers, government and quality entities, and insurers. Health information technology (HIT) is in general increasingly viewed as the most promising tool for improving the overall quality, safety and efficiency of the health delivery system (Chaudhry et al., 2006). Broad and consistent utilization of HIT will: 
Risk-based regulatory framework for health IT
September 4, 2013 the Health IT Policy Committee (HITPC) accepted and approved recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) working group for a risk-based regulatory framework for health information technology. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC), and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) kicked off the FDASIA workgroup of the HITPC to provide stakeholder input into a report on a risk-based regulatory framework that promotes safety and innovation and reduces regulatory duplication, consistent with section 618 of FDASIA. This provision permitted the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to form a workgroup in order to obtain broad stakeholder input from across the health care, IT, patients and innovation spectrum. The FDA, ONC, and FCC actively participated in these discussions with stakeholders from across the health care, IT, patients and innovation spectrum.
HIMSS Good Informatics Practices-GIP is aligned with FDA risk-based regulatory framework for health information technology.
GIP development began in 2004 developing risk-based IT technical guidance. Today the GIP peer-review and published modules are an excellent tool for educating Health IT professionals
Interoperable HIT will improve individual patient care, but it will also bring many public health benefits including: 
According to the article published by the Internal Journal of Medical Informatics,Health information sharing between patients and providers helps to improve diagnosis, promotes self care, and patients also know more information about their health. The use of electronic medical records (EMRs) is still scarce now but is increasing in Canada, American and British primary care. Healthcare information in EMRs are important sources for clinical, research, and policy questions. Health information privacy (HIP) and security has been a big concern for patients and providers. Studies in Europe evaluating electronic health information poses a threat to electronic medical records and exchange of personal information.
Concepts and Definitions.
Health information technology (HIT) is “the application of information processing involving both computer hardware and software that deals with the storage, retrieval, sharing, and use of health care information, data, and knowledge for communication and decision making” (Brailer, & Thompson, 2004). Technology is a broad concept that deals with a species' usage and knowledge of tools and crafts, and how it affects a species' ability to control and adapt to its environment. However, a strict definition is elusive; "technology" can refer to material objects of use to humanity, such as machines, hardware or utensils, but can also encompass broader themes, including systems, methods of organization, and techniques. For HIT, technology represents computers and communications attributes that can be networked to build systems for moving health information. Informatics is yet another integral aspect of HIT.
Informatics refers to the science of information, the practice of information processing, and the engineering of information systems. Informatics underlies the academic investigation and practitioner application of computing and communications technology to healthcare, health education, and biomedical research. Health informatics refers to the intersection of information science, computer science, and health care. Health informatics describes the use and sharing of information within the healthcare industry with contributions from computer science, mathematics, and psychology. It deals with the resources, devices, and methods required for optimizing the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in health and biomedicine. Health informatics tools include not only computers but also clinical guidelines, formal medical terminologies, and information and communication systems. Medical informatics, nursing informatics, public health informatics, and pharmacy informatics are subdisciplines that inform health informatics from different disciplinary perspectives. The processes and people of concern or study are the main variables.
Implementation of HIT.
The Institute of Medicine’s (2001) call for the use of electronic prescribing systems in all healthcare organizations by 2010 heightened the urgency to accelerate United States hospitals’ adoption of CPOE systems. In 2004, President Bush signed an Executive Order titled the President’s Health Information Technology Plan, which established a ten-year plan to develop and implement electronic medical record systems across the US to improve the efficiency and safety of care. According to a study by RAND Health, the US healthcare system could save more than $81 billion annually, reduce adverse healthcare events and improve the quality of care if it were to widely adopt health information technology.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, signed into law in 2009 under the Obama Administration, has provided approximately $19 billion in incentives for hospitals to shift from paper to electronic medical records. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has set aside $2 billion which will go towards programs developed by the National Coordinator and Secretary to help healthcare providers implement HIT and provide technical assistance through various regional centers. The other $17 billion in incentives comes from Medicare and Medicaid funding for those who adopt HIT before 2015. Healthcare providers who implement electronic records can receive up to $44,000 over four years in Medicare funding and $63,750 over six years in Medicaid funding. The sooner that healthcare providers adopt the system, the more funding they receive. Those who do not adopt electronic health record systems before 2015 do not receive any federal funding.
While electronic health records have potentially many advantages in terms of providing efficient and safe care, recent reports have brought to light some challenges with implementing electronic health records. The most immediate barriers for widespread adoption of this technology have been the high initial cost of implementing the new technology and the time required for doctors to train and adapt to the new system. There have also been suspected cases of fraudulent billing, where hospitals inflate their billings to Medicare. Given that healthcare providers have not reached the deadline (2015) for adopting electronic health records, it is unclear what effects this policy will have long term.
Types of technology.
In a recent study about the adoption of technology in the United States, Furukawa, and colleagues (2008) classified applications for prescribing to include electronic medical records (EMR), clinical decision support (CDS), and computerized physician order entry (CPOE). They further defined applications for dispensing to include bar-coding at medication dispensing (BarD), robot for medication dispensing (ROBOT), and automated dispensing machines (ADM). And, they defined applications for administration to include electronic medication administration records (EMAR) and bar-coding at medication administration (BarA).
Electronic Health Record (EHR).
A main problem in HIT adoption is mainly seen by physicians, an important stakeholder to the process of EHR. The Thorn et al. article, elicited that emergency physicians noticed that health information exchange disrupted workflow and was less desirable to use, even though the main goal of EHR is improving coordination of care. The problem was seen that exchanges didn't address the needs of end users, e.g. simplicity, user-friendly interface, and speed of systems. The same finding was seen in an earlier article with the focus on CPOE and physician resistance to its use, Bhattacherjee et al.
Clinical point of care technology.
Computerized Provider (Physician) Order Entry (CPOE).
Prescribing errors are the largest identified source of preventable errors in hospitals. A 2006 report by the Institute of Medicine estimated that a hospitalized patient is exposed to a medication error each day of his or her stay.
Computerized provider order entry (CPOE), formerly called Computer physician order entry, can reduce total medication error rates by 80%, and adverse (serious with harm to patient) errors by 55%. A 2004 survey by Leapfrog found that 16% of US clinics, hospitals and medical practices are expected to be utilizing CPOE within 2 years. In addition to electronic prescribing, a standardized bar code system for dispensing drugs could prevent a quarter of drug errors. Consumer information about the risks of the drugs and improved drug packaging (clear labels, avoiding similar drug names and dosage reminders) are other error-proofing measures. Despite ample evidence of the potential to reduce medication errors, competing systems of barcoding and electronic prescribing have slowed adoption of this technology by doctors and hospitals in the United States, due to concern with interoperability and compliance with future national standards. Such concerns are not inconsequential; standards for electronic prescribing for Medicare Part D conflict with regulations in many US states.
And, aside from regulatory concerns, for the small-practice physician, utilizing CPOE requires a major change in practice work flow and an additional investment of time. Many physicians are not full-time hospital staff; entering orders for their hospitalized patients means taking time away from scheduled patients.
Technological Innovations, Opportunities, and Challenges.
Handwritten reports or notes, manual order entry, non-standard abbreviations and poor legibility lead to substantial errors and injuries, according to the Institute of Medicine (2000) report. The follow-up IOM (2004) report, "Crossing the quality chasm: A new health system for the 21st century", advised rapid adoption of electronic patient records, electronic medication ordering, with computer- and internet-based information systems to support clinical decisions. However, many system implementations have experienced costly failures (Ammenwerth et al., 2006). Furthermore, there is evidence that CPOE may actually contribute to some types of adverse events and other medical errors.(Campbell et al., 2007) For example, the period immediately following CPOE implementation resulted in significant increases in reported adverse drug events in at least one study (Bradley, Steltenkamp, & Hite, 2006) and evidence of other errors have been reported.(Bates, 2005a; Bates, Leape, Cullen, & Laird, 1998; Bates; 2005b) Collectively, these reported adverse events describe phenomena related to the disruption of the complex adaptive system resulting from poorly implemented or inadequately planned technological innovation.
Technological Iatrogenesis.
Technology may introduce new sources of error Technologically induced errors are significant and increasingly more evident in care delivery systems. Terms to describe this new area of error production include the label technological iatrogenesis for the process and e-iatrogenic for the individual error. The sources for these errors include:
Healthcare information technology can also result in iatrogenesis if design and engineering are substandard, as illustrated in a 14-part detailed analysis done at the University of Sydney.
Revenue Cycle HIT.
The HIMSS Revenue Cycle Improvement Task Force was formed to prepare for the IT changes in the U.S. (e.g. the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (HITECH), Affordable Care Act, 5010 (electronic exchanges), ICD-10). An important change to the revenue cycle is the international classification of diseases (ICD) codes from 9 to 10. ICD-9 codes are set up to use three to five alphanumeric codes that represent 4,000 different types of procedures, while ICD-10 uses three to seven alphanumeric codes increasing procedural codes to 70,000. ICD-9 was outdated because there were more codes than procedures available, and to document for procedures without an ICD-9 code, a paper-work process of modifiers and supplemental documentation was used. Hence, ICD-10 was introduced to simplify the procedures with unknown codes and unify the standards closer to world standards (ICD-11). One of the main parts of Revenue Cycle HIT is charge capture, it utilizes codes to capture costs for reimbursements from different payers, such as CMS.
International Comparisons through HIT.
International health system performance comparisons are important for understanding health system complexities and finding better opportunities, which can be done through health information technology. It gives policy makers the chance to compare and contrast the systems through established indicators from health information technology, as inaccurate comparisons can lead to adverse policies.

Kieler Yacht-Club

Kieler Yacht-Club ("Kiel Yacht Club") is one of the oldest yacht clubs in Germany. It is located in the harbor city of Kiel. 
This club is well known for some of the yacht racing events it organizes. The main one is the yearly Kieler Woche (Kiel Week), which is perhaps the biggest sailing event in the world. 
In 1972, when the Olympic Games were held in Munich, the Olympic sailing competitions took place in the Kiel Bay and this yacht club had a major role in their organization.
Historical background.
A club for military personnel, the "Marine-Regatta-Verein" ("Naval Regatta Club"), was established in 1887 in Kiel by officers of the Imperial German Navy. Prince Heinrich of Prussia, a yachting enthusiast and German Emperor's Wilhelm II's younger brother, was its patron. In 1891 Wilhelm II became the club's commodore, bringing his own yacht "Meteor I" (the former "Thistle") to the club's marina in Kiel. The same year the club changed its name to "Kaiserlicher Yacht Club" (Imperial Yacht Club), among other changes introduced, the club allowed civilian members to join. 
In 1914, the German Emperor got the fateful news of the assassination of Austro-Hungarian heir to the throne Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, while he was competing on a regatta organized by the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club. During World War I the Kiel Week regatta had to be called off. 455 members of the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club died and its club house was transformed into a Lazaretto. After these difficult years the club almost went bankrupt. William II remained as honorary commodore of the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club, even after the Treaty of Versailles that brought the German monarchy to an end and forced him to live in exile in Doorn, the Netherlands. 
During Nazi rule the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club was manipulated by the propaganda machine of the state that made wide use of sports in order to harden the German spirit. This yacht club took part in the organization of Hitler's 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1937 the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club was forcefully merged with other yacht clubs to form a massive entity, the "Yacht-Club von Deutschland" (YCvD), "Yacht Club of Germany", to instill unity among German youth. The club's name "Kaiserlicher Yacht Club", deemed by the Nazis not to be in tune with "the spirit of the times", became history and exiled and ailing former Emperor William was stripped of the honorary commodore's title. During World War II sailing activities were discouraged, the club house was seized by the government and many members of the yacht club died in the war.
Establishment of Kiel Yacht Club.
In the postwar years Kiel was under British occupation, and regulations imposed by the new rulers made yacht clubs in Kiel no longer operative. British officers ran a "British Kiel Yacht Club", who even revived the Kiel Week regattas in 1946 and 1947, but German citizens were excluded from this military yacht club. 
In 1948, Kiel Yacht Club was allowed to be established and during the following decades it experienced a steady growth. After its recovery it became again one of the most prestigious yacht clubs of Germany. In 1982 the celebrations for the Kieler Woche's 100th birthday are organized with a large windjammer parade to close the event.
In 2007 Kiel Yacht Club ran into serious financial difficulties and had to sell its club house to the ThyssenKrupp Company.

Hypoxic Training Index

The Hypoxic Training index (HTi) provides an objective measure of the hypoxic stress delivered during the Intermittent Hypoxic Training (IHT) session, compared to simple recording the inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2). HTi provides a figure (index) of dosage received by the individual at the end of the session. Knowledge of HTi can therefore be used to alter the training regime for different individuals, compensating for individual variability, and can be used in scientific studies to ensure that subject exposure was correctly controlled.
Tissue hypoxia develops only when arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) drops to 90% or below. This is due to the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve. Saturations above 90% produce very little effect or decrease of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2). In order to obtain consistent and comparable values of HTi for different individuals the following conditions should be stipulated:
Calculation.
The resulting formula for calculating HTi is:
formula_1
where: <br>
HTi : Hypoxic Training index,<br>
t : period of time, and <br>
SpO2 (t) : SpO2 (%), arterial oxygen saturation value measured at one-second intervals.
This image shows a typical SpO2 curve during a full biofeedback-controlled IHT session. (FiO2 is altered automatically using biofeedback controlled hypoxicator to attain and sustain the desired SpO2 target value.)
Software to calculate Hypoxic Training Index.
Advanced biofeedback controlled hypoxicators are capable of adjusting the oxygen concentration in the inhaled hypoxic air automatically. This automatic biofeedback control allows targeting of the desired SpO2, compensating for individual variability. Software is also available to calculate HTi based on readings from a USB connected Pulse Oximeter.

USS Kanawha (1896)

The second USS "Kanawha" was a screw-powered steamer that served in the United States Navy in 1898 during the Spanish-American War.
"Kanawha" was built in 1896 by Charles L. Seabury and Company, Nyack on Hudson, New York. The U.S. Navy purchased her from John P. Duncan on 7 June 1898 for use in the Spanish-American War and armed her. She commissioned as USS "Kanawha" at the New York Navy Yard, New York, New York, on 26 July 1898, Lieutenant Frank F. Fletcher in command.
"Kanawha" steamed out of New York Harbor on 5 August 1898 and called at Port Royal, South Carolina, and Key West, Florida, before arriving at Gibara, Cuba, on 21 August 1898. She operated in Cuban waters supporting occupation forces until departing Gibara on 12 September 1898. After calling at Port Royal and Charleston, South Carolina, and at Hampton Roads, Virginia, she returned to New York on 29 September 1898.
"Kanawha" decommissioned on 8 October 1898 and was loaned to the Rhode Island Naval Militia on 12 December 1898. She was returned to the U.S. Navy on 12 August 1899 and transferred to the U.S. Department of War.

<doc id="19565386" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19565386" title="Cochinchina Campaign">
Cochinchina Campaign

The Cochinchina campaign (; ; ; 1858–1862), fought between the French and the Spanish on one side and the Vietnamese on the other, began as a limited punitive campaign and ended as a French war of conquest. The war concluded with the establishment of the French colony of Cochinchina, a development that inaugurated nearly a century of French colonial dominance in Vietnam.
Background.
The French had few pretexts to justify their imperial ambitions in Indochina. In the early years of the 19th century some Frenchmen believed that the Vietnamese emperor Gia Long owed the French a favour for the help French troops had given him in 1802 against his Tây Sơn enemies, but it soon became clear that the Gia Long felt no more bound to France than he did to China, which had also provided help. Gia Long felt that as the French government did not honour their agreement to assist him in the civil war—the Frenchmen who helped him were volunteers and adventurers not government units—he was not obliged to give them favours. Certainly, he and his successor Minh Mạng flirted with the French. Although the Vietnamese soon learned to reproduce the elaborate Vaubanesque fortresses that had been built at the end of the 18th century by French engineers, and no longer needed French technical assistance in the art of fortification, they were still interested in buying French cannon and rifles. But this limited contact with the French counted for little. Neither Gia Long nor Minh Mạng had any intention of coming under French influence. 
But the French were not prepared to be brushed off quite so easily. As so often during the era of European colonial expansion, religion offered an excuse for intervention. French missionaries had been active in Vietnam since the 17th century, and by the middle of the 19th century there were perhaps 300,000 Roman Catholic converts in Annam and Tonkin. Most of their bishops and priests were either French or Spanish. Most Vietnamese disliked and suspected this sizeable Christian community and its foreign leaders. The French, conversely, began to feel responsible for their safety. Harassment of the Christians eventually provided France with a respectable pretext for attacking Vietnam. The tension built up gradually. During the 1840s, persecution or harassment of Catholic missionaries in Vietnam by the Vietnamese emperors Minh Mạng and Thiệu Trị evoked only sporadic and unofficial French reprisals. The decisive step towards the establishment of a French colonial empire in Indochina was not taken until 1858.
In 1857, the Vietnamese emperor Tự Đức (r. 1848–83) executed two Spanish Catholic missionaries. This was neither the first nor the last such incident, and on previous occasions the French government had overlooked such provocations. But this time, Tự Đức's timing was inopportune, as it coincided with the Second Opium War. France and Britain had just despatched a joint military expedition to the Far East to chastise China, with the result that the French had troops on hand with which to intervene in Annam. In November 1857, Napoleon III of France authorised Admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly to send a punitive expedition to Vietnam. In September 1858, a joint French and Spanish expedition landed at Tourane (Da Nang) and captured the town.
Tourane and Saigon.
The allies expected an easy victory, but the war did not at first go as planned. The Vietnamese Christians did not rise in support of the French (as the missionaries had been confidently predicting they would), Vietnamese resistance was more stubborn than had been expected, and the French and Spanish found themselves besieged in Tourane by a Vietnamese army under the command of Nguyễn Tri Phương. The Siege of Tourane lasted for nearly three years, and although there was little fighting disease took a heavy toll of the allied expedition. The garrison of Tourane was reinforced from time to time, and occasionally mounted local attacks against the Vietnamese positions, but was unable to break the siege.
In October 1858, shortly after his capture of Tourane, Rigault de Genouilly cast around for somewhere else to strike the Vietnamese. Realising that the French garrison at Tourane was unlikely to achieve anything useful, he weighed up the possibility of action in either Tonkin or Cochinchina. He considered and rejected the possibility of an expedition to Tonkin, which would require a large-scale uprising by the Christians to have any chance of success, and in January 1859 proposed to the navy ministry an expedition against Saigon in Cochinchina, a city of considerable strategic significance as a source of food for the Vietnamese army.
The expedition was approved, and in early February, leaving "capitaine de vaisseau" Thoyon at Tourane with a small French garrison and two gunboats, Rigault de Genouilly sailed south for Saigon. On 17 February 1859, after forcing the river defences and destroying a series of forts and stockades along the Saigon river, the French and Spanish captured Saigon. French marine infantry stormed the enormous Citadel of Saigon, while Filipino troops under Spanish command threw back a Vietnamese counterattack. The allies were not strong enough to hold the citadel, and on 8 March 1859 blew it up and set fire to its rice magazines. In April, Rigault de Genouilly returned to Tourane with the bulk of his forces to reinforce Thoyon's hard-pressed garrison, leaving "capitaine de frégate" Bernard Jauréguiberry (the future French navy minister) at Saigon with a Franco-Spanish garrison of around 1,000 men.
The capture of Saigon proved to be as hollow a victory for the French and Spanish as their earlier capture of Tourane. Jauréguiberry's small force, which suffered substantial losses in a surprise attack on a Vietnamese fortification to the west of Saigon on 21 April 1859, was forced to remain behind its defences thereafter. Meanwhile, the French government was distracted from its Far Eastern ambitions by the outbreak of the Austro-Sardinian War, which tied down large numbers of French troops in Italy. In November 1859, Rigault de Genouilly was replaced by Admiral François Page, who was instructed to obtain a treaty protecting the Catholic faith in Vietnam but not to seek any territorial gains. Page opened negotiations on this basis in early November, but without result. The Vietnamese, aware of France's distraction in Italy, refused these moderate terms and spun out the negotiations in the hope that the allies would cut their losses and abandon the campaign altogether. On 18 November 1859 Page bombarded and captured the Kien Chan forts at Tourane, but this allied tactical victory failed to change the stance of the Vietnamese negotiators. The war continued into 1860.
During the second half of 1859 and throughout 1860, the French were unable to substantially reinforce the garrisons of Tourane and Saigon. Although the Austro-Sardinian War soon ended, by early 1860 the French were again at war with China, and Page had to divert most of his forces to support Admiral Léonard Charner's China expedition. In April 1860, Page left Cochinchina to join Charner at Canton. Meanwhile, in March 1860, a Vietnamese army around 4,000 strong began to besiege Saigon. The defence of Saigon was entrusted to "capitaine de vaisseau" d'Ariès. The Franco-Spanish force in Saigon, only 1,000 men strong, had to support a siege by greatly superior numbers from March 1860 to February 1861. Realising that they could not hold both Saigon and Tourane, the French evacuated the garrison of Tourane in March 1860, bringing the Siege of Tourane to an inglorious end.
Ky Hoa and Mỹ Tho.
Although the French had evacuated Tourane, they successfully held out in Saigon for the remainder of 1860. But they were not strong enough to break the Vietnamese siege of Saigon. The military stalemate was only broken in early 1861, as a result of the ending of the war with China. Admirals Charner and Page were now free to return to Cochinchina and resume the campaign around Saigon. A naval armada of 70 ships under Charner's command and 3,500 soldiers under the command of General de Vassoigne were transferred from northern China to Saigon. Charner's squadron, the most powerful French naval force seen in Vietnamese waters before the creation of the French Far East Squadron on the eve of the Sino-French War (August 1884–April 1885), included the steam frigates "Impératrice Eugénie" and "Renommée" (Charner and Page's respective flagships), the corvettes "Primauguet", "Laplace" and "Du Chayla", eleven screw-driven despatch vessels, five first-class gunboats, seventeen transports and a hospital ship. The squadron was accompanied by half a dozen armed lorchas purchased in Macao.
With this powerful reinforcement, the allies eventually began to gain the upper hand. On 24 and 25 February 1861, the French and Spanish in Saigon successfully assaulted the Vietnamese siege lines, defeating marshal Nguyễn Tri Phương's besieging Vietnamese army in the battle of Ky Hoa. The Vietnamese fought bitterly to defend their positions, and allied casualties were considerable.
The victory at Ky Hoa allowed the French and Spanish to move to the offensive. In April 1861, Mỹ Tho fell to the French. An assault force under the command of "capitaine de vaisseau" Le Couriault du Quilio, supported by a small flotilla of gunboats, advanced on Mỹ Tho from the north along the Bao Dinh Ha creek, and between 1 and 11 April destroyed several Vietnamese forts and fought its way along the creek to the environs of Mỹ Tho. Le Couriault de Quilio gave orders for an assault on the town on 12 April, but in the event the assault was not necessary. A flotilla of warships under the command of Admiral Page, who had been sent by Charner to sail up the Mekong River to attack Mỹ Tho by sea, appeared off the town on the same day. Mỹ Tho was occupied by the French on 12 April 1861 without a shot being fired.
In March 1861, shortly before the capture of Mỹ Tho, the French again offered terms to Tự Đức. This time the terms were considerably harsher than those offered by Page in November 1859. The French demanded the free exercise of Christianity in Vietnam, the cession of Saigon province, an indemnity of 4 million piastres, freedom of commerce and movement inside Vietnam and the establishment of French consulates. Tự Đức was only prepared to concede on the free exercise of religion, and rejected the other French terms. The war went on, and after the fall of Mỹ Tho the French raised their territorial claims to include Mỹ Tho province as well as Saigon province.
Unable to confront the French and Spanish forces in battle, Tự Đức resorted to guerilla warfare, sending his agents into the conquered Vietnamese provinces to organise resistance to the invaders. Charner responded on 19 May by declaring Saigon and Mỹ Tho provinces to be in a state of siege. French columns roved through the Cochinchinese countryside, fanning popular resistance by the brutality with which they treated suspected insurgents. Charner had ordered them not to offer violence to peaceful villagers, but these orders were not always obeyed. The Vietnamese guerillas on occasion posed a serious threat to the French. On 22 June 1861 the French post at Gò Công was attacked, unsuccessfully, by 600 Vietnamese insurgents.
Bien Hoa and Vĩnh Long.
The Capture of Mỹ Tho was Charner's last military success. He returned to France in the summer of 1861, and was replaced in command of the Cochinchina expedition by Admiral Louis-Adolphe Bonard (1805–67), who arrived in Saigon at the end of November 1861. A mere fortnight after his arrival in Saigon, in reprisal for the loss of the French lorcha "Espérance" and all her crew in an ambush, Bonard mounted a major campaign to overrun Đồng Nai Province. Biên Hòa, the provincial capital, was captured by the French on 16 December 1861.
The French followed up their victory at Biên Hòa by capturing Vĩnh Long on 22 March 1862, in a brief campaign mounted by Admiral Bonard in reprisal for Vietnamese guerilla attacks on French troops around Mỹ Tho. In the most serious of these incidents, on 10 March 1862, a French gunboat leaving Mỹ Tho with a company of infantry aboard suddenly exploded. Casualties were heavy (52 men killed or wounded), and the French were convinced that the gunboat had been sabotaged by insurgents directed by the governors of Vĩnh Long Province.
Ten days later, Bonard anchored off Vĩnh Long with a flotilla of eleven despatch vessels and gunboats and a Franco-Spanish landing force of 1,000 troops. In the afternoon and evening of 22 March, the French and Spanish assaulted the Vietnamese batteries entrenched before Vĩnh Long and captured them. On 23 March they entered the citadel of Vĩnh Long. Its defenders retreated to a fortified earthwork at My Cui, 20 kilometres to the west of Mỹ Tho, but two allied columns pursued them and drove them from My Cui while a third cut off their retreat northwards. Vietnamese casualties at Vĩnh Long and My Cui were heavy.
The fall of Vĩnh Long, coming after the loss of Mỹ Tho and Bien Hoa, disheartened the Court of Huế, and in April 1862 Tự Đức let it be known that he was willing to make peace.
In May 1862, following preliminary discussions at Huế, the French corvette "Forbin" sailed to Tourane to receive Vietnamese plenipotentiaries charged with concluding peace. The Vietnamese were given three days to produce their ambassadors. The sequel was described by Colonel Thomazi, the historian of the French conquest of Indochina:
On the third day, an old paddlewheel corvette, the "Aigle des Mers", was seen slowly leaving the Tourane river. Her beflagged keel was in a state of dilapidation that excited the laughter of our sailors. It was obvious that she had not gone to sea for many years. Her cannons were rusty, her crew in rags, and she was towed by forty oared junks and escorted by a crowd of light barges. She carried the plenipotentiaries of Tự Đức. "Forbin" took her under tow and brought her to Saigon, where the negotiations were briskly concluded. On 5 June a treaty was signed aboard the vessel "Duperré", moored before Saigon.
The peace.
By then the French were not in a merciful mood. What had begun as a minor punitive expedition had turned into a long, bitter and costly war. It was unthinkable that France should emerge from this struggle empty-handed. Tự Đức's minister Phan Thanh Giản signed a treaty with Admiral Bonard and the Spanish representative Colonel Palanca y Gutierrez on 5 June 1862. The Treaty of Saigon required Vietnam to permit the Catholic faith to be preached and practised freely within its territory; to cede the provinces of Biên Hòa, Gia Định and Định Tường and the island of Poulo Condore to France; to allow the French to trade and travel freely along the Mekong River; to open Tourane, Quảng Yên and Ba Lac (at the mouth of the Red River) as trading ports; and to pay an indemnity of a million dollars to France and Spain over a ten-year period. The French placed the three southern Vietnamese provinces under the control of the navy ministry. Thus, casually, was born the French colony of Cochinchina, with its capital at Saigon.
Aftermath.
In 1864 the three southern provinces ceded to France were formally constituted as the French colony of Cochinchina. Within three years, France's new colony doubled in size. In 1867 Admiral Pierre de la Grandière forced the Vietnamese to cede the provinces of Châu Đốc, Hà Tiên and Vĩnh Long to France. The Vietnamese emperor Tự Đức initially refused to accept the validity of this cession, but eventually recognized French dominion over the six provinces of Cochinchina in the 1874 Treaty of Saigon, negotiated by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre after the military intervention of Francis Garnier in Tonkin.
The Spanish, who had played a junior role in the Cochinchina campaign, received a share of the indemnity but made no territorial acquisitions in Vietnam. Instead, they were encouraged by the French to seek a sphere of influence in Tonkin. Nothing came of this suggestion, however, and Tonkin ultimately fell under French control also, becoming a French protectorate in 1883.
Perhaps the most important factor in Tự Đức's decision to make peace was the threat posed to his authority by a serious uprising in Tonkin led by the Catholic nobleman Le Bao Phung, who claimed descent from the old Lê Dynasty. Although the French and Spanish rejected Le's offer of an alliance against Tự Đức, the insurgents in Tonkin were able to inflict several defeats on Vietnamese government forces. The end of the war with France and Spain allowed Tự Đức to overwhelm the insurgents in Tonkin and restore government control there. Le Bao Phung was eventually captured, tortured and put to death.

Neal E. Boyd

Neal E. Boyd (born November 18, 1975) is an American pop opera singer. He is best known as being the winner of the third season of "America's Got Talent".
Early life.
Neal E. Boyd, known as "The Voice of Missouri", grew up in Sikeston, Missouri. He discovered operatic music in junior high school when his older brother was forced to do a school project involving classical music and brought home a CD of the Three Tenors. His brother had little appreciation for classical music, but Neal was so enamored by the passion and skill of the famous trio that he started learning to sing in Luciano Pavarotti's and Plácido Domingo's operatic styles. A creative seed was planted, and Neal went on to study Speech Communications, Political Science, and Vocal Music at Southeast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau, MO, and the University of Missouri in Columbia, MO, graduating from both universities simultaneously in May 2001. He was the winner of the Music Teachers National Association (MTNA) Vocal Collegiate Championship in 2000 while in the voice studio of Professor Ann Harrell of the UM-Columbia. This national win led to his solo debut at New York City's famed Carnegie Hall in March 2001. After teaching music for a year in his hometown of Sikeston, MO, he later attended the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, MA to study opera — which led to a lead role as the slave "York" in Michael Ching's World Premier Opera "Corps of Discovery, A Musical Journey," commissioned by MU.
Boyd was his high school's student body president in 1993 and 1994 and the president of the Student Senate at Southeast Missouri State University, where he was also a member of Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity. He has a bachelor's degree in speech communications from Southeast Missouri State University, a Bachelor's degree in music from the University of Missouri-Columbia, and a Master’s degree in management from the University of Phoenix. In 2001, he had planned to attend Yale University, but plans changed when he decided to study with another professor at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston.
In 2000, he sang at the memorial service for former Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan who died in a plane crash during his U.S. Senate run against then Senator and later U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft. In 2005, he sang the National Anthem at the inauguration of Missouri Governor Matt Blunt. While in college, Boyd interned at the capitol in Jefferson City, Missouri. Various Missouri state and local officials nicknamed Boyd "The Voice of Missouri" due to his appearances at many prominent statewide events.
"America's Got Talent".
Boyd was the winner of "America's Got Talent" in 2008, and was awarded the $1-million prize and a headline show in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Post "Talent".
Neal was awarded the $1-million prize and a headline show in Las Vegas, Nevada, hosted by Jerry Springer.
On October 2008, Neal's hometown declared the month of October "Neal E. Boyd Month."
Neal signed to Decca Records and released his debut album, "My American Dream," on June 23, 2009, the day of the fourth season premiere of "America's Got Talent." It debuted at #195 on the Billboard 200 and #3 on the Top Classical Albums Chart.
On March 10, 2010, Neal performed for the current U.S. President Barack Obama while visiting Missouri. Since 2000, Boyd has also performed for Presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.
Neal is the co-owner of Cox & Boyd, an insurance agency with locations in St Louis and Sikeston Missouri, and the Vice President of sales for Voluntary Benefit Services which is located in St. Louis, Missouri.
Politics.
Boyd is a Republican. He ran for a seat in the Missouri House of Representatives in 2012, but lost to Democrat Steve Hodges by 66 to 34%. On September 5, 2013 Boyd announced that he would again seek to be elected to the Missouri House of Representatives from the 149th district in 2014. Hodges, his Democratic opponent in 2012, is term-limited by Missouri law and cannot run again. 
On August 28, 2012, Boyd performed Lee Greenwood's "God Bless the USA" at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida.

One-seventh area triangle

In plane geometry, a triangle ABC contains a triangle of one-seventh area of ABC formed as follows: the sides of this triangle lie on lines p, q, r where
The proof of the existence of the one-seventh area triangle follows from the construction of six parallel lines:
The suggestion of Hugo Steinhaus is that the (central) triangle with sides p,q,r be reflected in its sides and vertices. These six extra triangles partially cover ABC, and leave six overhanging extra triangles lying outside ABC. Focusing on the parallelism of the full construction (offered by Martin Gardner through James Randi’s on-line magazine), the pair-wise congruencies of overhanging and missing pieces of ABC is evident. Thus six plus the original equals the whole triangle ABC.
According to Cook and Wood (2004), this triangle puzzled Richard Feynman in a dinner conversation; they go on to give four different proofs. De Villiers (2005) provides a generalization and an analogous result for a parallelogram.
A more general result is known as Routh's theorem.

Baron Rodolphe Hottinguer

Baron Rodolphe Hottinguer was the first-born son of Jean-Henri. He was born in Paris in 1835 and died there in 1920. Like his father, Rodolphe at the age of 18 left Paris on a journey to England. He returned to Paris for a very short period before he took off on another voyage, the destination this time was America. When he returned, he would achieved a vast success in the financial world. His first stop would be Constantinople, where he linked Hottinger & Cie with all the great banking families in Europe. During this time founded the Ottoman Bank. For this he was personally thanked by the sultan and made grand Vizier. 
During his time, the Hottinger banking house played an important role in major development projects in France and elsewhere in Europe: creation of major manufacturing and services companies, the co-founding of banking and insurance companies and the first railways—Baron Rodolphe was Vice Chairman of Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée, and his portrait, next to that of Sarah Bernhardt, still forms part of the fresco depicting numerous personalities of the time at the famous Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon in Paris.
The Work of Baron Rodolphe during this time was to safeguard the Hottinguer Bank during the agitated times of the war of 1870 and the Great War. When he reached the age of 83 he entrusted the Bank to his son Henri Hottinguer.

<doc id="19565741" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19565741" title="Dryolestoidea">
Dryolestoidea

Dryolestoidea is an extinct clade of Mesozoic mammals that only contains two orders. It has been suggested that this group contained the ancestors of modern therian mammals.
Characteristics.
Dryolestids are mostly represented by teeth, fragmented dentaries and parts of the rostrum. The Jurassic forms retained a coronoid and splenial, but the Cretaceous forms lack these. Another primitive feature is the presence of a Meckelian groove (the Cretaceous forms have a reduced version).
Tooth enamel evolved differently in marsupials and eutherians. In a first phase, during the late Triassic and Jurassic, prisms separated from the interprismatic matrix, probably independently in several Mesozoic mammal lineages. More derived enamel types evolved in a second phase, during the Tertiary and Quaternary, but without replacing the old prismatic enamel, instead forming various combinations of three-dimensional structures (called schmelzmuster). Dryolestid dentition is thought to resemble the primitive mammalian dentition before the marsupial-eutherian differentiation and dryolestids are candidates to be the last common ancestor of the two mammalian subclasses.
Distribution.
Dryolestoids are known from the Jurassic through Early Cretaceous of the northern hemisphere (North America, Eurasia, and North Africa) and from the Late Cretaceous through Paleocene of South America. Drylestoids are very rarely found in the Cenozoic, as are the few other Mesozoic mammals with later descendants, such as multituberculates, monotremes, and gondwanatheres.
The oldest undisputed fossils of "Dryolestidae" were found in the Guimarota coal mine near Leiria, Portugal, the largest known deposit of Jurassic mammals. The tooth pattern of these fossils — 8–9 mesiodistally compressed molars with small, cusp-like talonids — distinguish them from tribosphenic mammals, and they form a sister group of the latter and "Peramus" together with "Amphitherium", Paurodontidae, and Henkelotheriidae.
The youngest fossil in the northern hemisphere is "Crusafontia cuencana" from early Cretaceous of Uña and Galve, Spain, though a fragmentary lower molar from the late Cretaceous Mesaverde Formation in Wyoming has been attributed to Dryolestidae. In South America, dryolestids survived until the late Cretaceous when they underwent a remarkable radiation.

Miles Gloriosus (play)

Miles Gloriosus is a comedic play written by Titus Maccius Plautus (c. 254–184 B.C.). It is also known as "The Swaggering Soldier". His source for "Miles Gloriosus" was a Greek play, now lost, called Alazon or The Braggart. Although the characters in "Miles Gloriosus" speak Latin, they are Greeks, with Greek names, clothing, and customs. The action takes place in Ephesus, a Greek city on the coast of Asia Minor, famous for its Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
Plot summary.
The Back-story and prologue.
The play commences with the entrance of Pyrgopolynices, looking heroic and posing in a pompous manner. Behind him is his “parasite”, Artotrogus, who earns his meals by flattering the soldier excessively, and several minions who carry his monstrous shield. At these opening moments we get a sense for Pyrgopolynices' true nature. He constantly boasts about his accomplishments and portrays himself as a fantastic military hero. In reality, his accomplishments are far smaller—hence the play's title. 
 After he leaves the stage we meet one of the main characters of the play, Palaestrio, who formerly served a young Athenian, Pleusicles. His former master had a girlfriend named Philocomasium who was kidnapped from Athens and taken by Pyrgopolynices. When Palaestrio tried to reach his master with this bad news, the slave was seized by pirates and given, by chance, to the same soldier. Both he and the girl have been living in the soldier’s house in Ephesus, but Palaestrio has sent a letter secretly to his former master telling him where they are. Now Pleusicles has come to Ephesus and is staying with Periplectomenus, who lives next door to the soldier, and the wise Palaestrio has cut a hole in the wall so the two lovers can see one another.
Palaestrio’s Trickery.
 
Periplectomenus, an old man of Ephesus, then enters, worried because he has caught one of Pyrgopolynices' slaves on the roof between the two houses, looking in through the skylight. This slave claims he was chasing a monkey, but Periplectomenus is sure that Philocomasium has been seen kissing her gentleman friend (Pleusicles). 
Palaestrio comes up with a plan to tell Pyrgopolynices that Philocomasium has a twin sister, Honoria, who is visiting Ephesus with her lover and mother and staying with Periplectomenus. Should Sceledrus make accusations, then Palaestrio will just refute the claim, and say it’s her twin. Periplectomenus goes back inside to tell Philocomasium what has happened and to tell her the plan. Meanwhile, Philocomasium goes through the hole in the wall back into Pyrgopolynices' house, emerging from it shortly afterwards with Palaestrio and Sceledrus. Philocomasium tells Sceledrus that she had a dream that her twin sister had arrived from Athens. Sceledrus has his doubts, so Philocomasium goes back into Pyrgopolynices' house, then through the hole in the wall and comes out of the other house as her twin sister Honoria. Meanwhile, Sceledrus stands guard outside Pyrgopolynices' house. Meanwhile, Philocomasium comes out of Periplectomenus' front door, giving orders to slaves inside. She challenges Sceledrus when he addresses her as Philocomasium, and her manner is that of a free woman. She says her name is Honoria and that she has arrived the previous night from Athens, and wants to try to find her twin sister Philocomasium. Sceledrus is now convinced. He promises Palaestrio that he will not speak of this again. Just then Periplectomenus comes out and is furious at Sceledrus and how he has treated his “lady guest.” He threatens to whip him but gets over it right away. Sceledrus who still thinks he’s been tricked, and thinks that there is a plot to get Pyrgopolynices to sell him to another master, decides to say nothing for the moment.
The Plan to fight the Braggart.
Palaestrio, Periplectomenus, and Pleusicles all emerge from the house and Palaestrio has come up with yet another plan to bring down Pyrgopolynices and get back Philocomasium. On request, Periplectomenus hands his ring to Palaestrio, who then explains his plan. He needs Periplectomenus to find an accomplished and beautiful woman, who can act the part of Periplectomenus' wife and can claim to be desperate to leave Periplectomenus for Pyrgopolynices. He also stipulates that this woman should have a maid. Periplectomenus knows just the woman - Acroteleutium - who has a maid called Milphidippa. He brings both back to his house, having explained the plot and their role in it. Meanwhile, Palaestrio tells Pyrgopolynices all about Periplectomenus' 'wife' and gives him the ring. Pyrgopolynices agrees to meet her but doesn’t know what to do with Philocomasium. Palaestrio tells him to let her go but to also let her keep all the gold and jewels that he got her, just so she would not be upset.
 Pyrgopolynices follows Palaestrio’s advice and runs inside to tell her. Moments later, he comes back and tells the audience he has succeeded. He gave her everything that she wanted, and he even gave her Palaestrio! At this time, Acroteleutium has come out of the house, and begins to describe what she is feeling for the soldier. How she can’t take it anymore, and how her eyes will cut off her tongue when she catches a glimpse of him. The two meet, and Acroteleutium tells Pyrgopolynices to come to her husband’s house. Pyrgopolynices is hesitant in this, but she explains that it was in her dowry that she gets to keep the house. The soldier tells her to wait inside for him; just then Pleusicles comes in dressed as a sailor to help gather Palaestrio and Philocomasium.
The end of the Play and the Braggart.
The soldier says his final good-byes to Palaestrio and Philocomasium, and goes back inside to meet Acroteleutium. Just then he is ambushed by Periplectomenus, and his cook Cario. The two men begin to beat him for trying to make advances on a married woman. Pyrgopolynices begs them to stop; eventually giving the men a hundred drachmae to halt their punches. The men leave the beaten soldier to his own accord; suddenly Sceledrus enters and lets the soldier know what really happened. Pyrgopolynices realized he has been tricked, but does not seem upset about the whole ordeal. The play comes to an end when he tells the audience to applaud.

Victoria Seals

The Victoria Seals were a professional baseball team based in Victoria, British Columbia. The Seals were a member of the North Division of the independent Golden Baseball League, which is not affiliated with either Major League Baseball "or" Minor League Baseball. They joined the GBL on October 1, 2008. The Seals played their home games at Royal Athletic Park, a multipurpose stadium in Victoria which is also used for soccer, softball and football. On November 10, 2010, team owners Russ and Darren Parker announced that the team would be ceasing operations immediately after being unable to reach an agreement with the City of Victoria on the condition of the ballpark and the instability of the Golden Baseball League.
The rights to the franchise were purchased by Westpro Productions and will be relocated to Fort McMurray, Alberta. 
Attendance.
The Seals inaugural season boasted impressive attendance figures, with an average draw of 2,388 per game, good enough for second best in the GBL. Furthermore, average capacity was 53%, which was the highest overall capacity total in the league. By contrast, these numbers were higher than the GBL's other Canadian teams, the Calgary Vipers and the Edmonton Capitals, in both capacity percentage and total attendance. The Seals also missed a sellout by only 19 people on their final game of the 2009 season, with 4228 fans in attendance. They drew 10,045 fans on their final (three-game) home-stand, bringing their total attendance for 2009 to 93,691 fans.
Attendance improved in 2010 and the Seals drew 116,872 fans in 45 home dates at Royal Athletic Park. Their average attendance (2,597 per game) was third best in the ten-team league. The single-game attendance record for the franchise was set on Tuesday July 27, 2010 when 4,753 fans turned out to see Eri Yoshida pitch.
Ownership.
The Seals are owned by Russ Parker and his son Darren. Russ is the former owner of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League's Calgary Cannons (now the Albuquerque Isotopes). He is also the long-time owner of the Regina Pats hockey team of the Western Hockey League.
On-field staff.
On November 25, 2008, the Seals named former Major League infielder Darrell Evans as their first manager. Before joining the Seals, Evans was the first manager of the Long Beach Armada from 2005 to 2007, and last served as batting coach for the Orange County Flyers, who won the GBL title in 2008. On March 4, 2010, Evans was fired as manager of the Seals after being discovered to have "solicited employment with another team". That team is believed to be the Palm Springs Chill of the California Winter League.
On March 8, 2010, the Seals announced the hiring of former Major League All-Star Bret Boone as their new manager. Boone is no stranger to the Pacific Northwest, having played for the nearby Seattle Mariners for several seasons during his major league career.
Joining Bret Boone in 2010 as members of the Seals' on-field staff are former major-leaguer Kip Gross as pitching coach, and second-year Seals catcher Josh Arhart, who along with regular playing duties will also serve as bench coach.
On May 27, 2010, the Seals announced that Bret Boone had resigned from his position as field manager in order to deal with a personal family issue. Boone managed the team to a 3-2 record during his short stint with the club. It was further announced that pitching coach Kip Gross took on Boone's duties as field manager. Infielder Brian Rios also took on duties as a player/coach.

<doc id="19566160" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19566160" title="Ker's WingHouse">
Ker's WingHouse

Ker's WingHouse is a restaurant franchise based primarily in the Southeastern United States, founded by former National Football League player Crawford Ker.
Investment.
When Ker was playing for the Denver Broncos, he purchased part interest in the "Frat House", a restaurant in Gainesville, Florida. The eatery failed, due to numerous underage drinking busts, and Ker lost his entire investment. It was an expensive lesson about absentee ownership.
Opening.
In 1992, Ker retired from the NFL and took a job selling cars at a local dealer. In 1994, he purchased half interest in a Largo, Florida wing restaurant called, ""Knockers"" that imitated Hooters. This time, he wasn't an absentee owner, but Ker's business partner handled the management. After losing $30,000 a month for the first quarter, Crawford was certain he could do a better job, so he bought out his partner and handled the day-to-day operations, learning as he went along. The restaurant was re-opened as Ker's WingHouse, and the atmosphere was toned down to make it more family friendly. 
The restaurant did well and two additional locations were opened in the Tampa Bay area in the following three years.
Lawsuit.
Ker won a $1.2-million jury award from Hooters in late 2004, which had sued him for trademark violations for allegedly using their uniforms and decor. After a three-week trial in which lawyers discussed hula hoops, surfboards, scrunchy socks, pantyhose and something called "vicarious sexual recreation", the jury ruled that no trademark infringement existed and Hooters was penalized for their frivilous lawsuit.
Hooters appealed the decision, but in June, 2006, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta upheld the verdict.
Expansion.
As of 2007, the company had 1,700 employees at 22 locations with revenue of nearly $60 million. Ker attended, and the company participated in, the 2007 National Buffalo Wing Festival and placed first in the "traditional x-hot sauce" category and gained some national recognition.
Franchising.
On June 4, 2008 the company announced the launch of its national franchise program. In mid-2008 the chain operated 19 locations in Florida and Texas and expected to add six franchises by the end of 2008, and 48 by 2011. The initial focus was for franchises in the Southeastern US. 
WingHouses feature several amenities that differ from other wing restaurants, including Hooters. There is a full liquor bar in every store, sports memorabilia line the walls instead of NASCAR and most locations include a game room.
Charity.
Super Bowl XLIII in Tampa, Florida attracted the rich and famous; Ker's WingHouse hosted three events to raise money for charity

1994 Philadelphia Eagles season

The 1994 Philadelphia Eagles season was their 62nd in the league. On May 6, 1994, the NFL approved the transfer of majority interest in the club from Norman Braman to Jeffrey Lurie. The team failed to improve upon their previous output of 8–8, winning only seven games and failing to qualify for the playoffs.
Rich Kotite's fate as Eagles head coach was sealed after a seven-game losing streak to end the season knocked Philly from the top of the NFC at 7–2 all the way to fourth place in the Eastern Division. One key injury was the season-ending broken leg suffered by linebacker Byron Evans, who was lost in game #10 against Cleveland.
The epitome of this collapse came on Christmas Eve at Cincinnati, when the 2–13 Bengals scored six points in the final seconds – thanks in part to the recovery of a fumbled kick return – to steal a win.
The high point of the '94 season occurred on October 2 at Candlestick Park, when the Eagles steamrolled the eventual Super Bowl winning 49ers by a 40–8 count.

With a record of 7 and 9, and despite starting the season at 7 and 2, the Eagles failed to make the 1994 NFL Playoffs.
Post Season.
Shortly after the season ended Head coach Rich Kotite was fired. There was rumors that the Eagles new owner, Jeffrey Lurie would not keep him on as coach. His fate was sealed when after a 7 and 2 start the Eagles lost the last 7 games off the season and missed the playoffs.
During the few weeks the Eagles would interview outside the organization for a replacement. They had to wait to until the Super Bowl was played to talk to candidates from the teams in the playoffs. Less than a week after Super Bowl XXIX won by the San Francisco 49ers the Eagles hired their Defensive Coordinator, Ray Rhodes.

<doc id="19566434" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19566434" title="Stroke Belt">
Stroke Belt

Stroke Belt or Stroke Alley is a name given to a region in the southeastern United States that has been recognized by public health authorities for having an unusually high incidence of stroke and other forms of cardiovascular disease. It is typically defined as an 11-state region consisting of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. 
Although many possible causes for the high stroke incidence have been investigated, the reasons for the phenomenon have not been determined.
Geographic scope.
The stroke belt is typically defined to include the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. In 1980 these eleven states had age-adjusted stroke mortality rates more than 10% above the national average. 
Some investigators also consider northern Florida to be a part of the stroke belt, based on a stroke mortality rate higher than several states included in the region. East Texas also is characterized as a stroke belt.
History of observations.
The stroke belt was first identified in 1962 by Centers for Disease Control (CDC) researchers who noted a concentration of high stroke death rates in the Atlantic coastal plain counties of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Similar high stroke rates were later observed in the Mississippi Delta region as well. 
Analysis by the CDC of U.S. mortality statistics from the period 1991 to 1998 found that for both blacks and whites the counties with the highest stroke death rates were in the southeastern states and the Mississippi Delta region. Stroke death rates for states ranged from a high of 169 per 100,000 in South Carolina to a low of 89 per 100,000 in New York. While most observational studies have focused primarily on stroke incidence in adults, in 2004 researchers reported that children in the eleven stroke belt states also have an increased risk of death from ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke compared with children in other states. 
Glymour et al. (2007) reported that adults who had resided in the stroke belt during childhood and had moved outside the region had higher stroke risk at ages 50 and older than adults who grew up in areas with lower stroke incidence. A study reported in 2011 found that people over age 45 living in the eight "stroke belt" states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee had an 18 percent higher incidence of cognitive decline than people in other U.S. regions. Another researcher noted that, "Stroke by itself is a major contributor to cognitive impairment and dementia." Other researchers have made similar observations. 
In 2011, CDC researchers mapped the occurrence of diabetes in the U.S. by county, finding that highest prevalence of diabetes is in a "diabetes belt" that has extensive overlap with the stroke belt.
Hypotheses on causation.
The causes of the elevated incidence of stroke in the stroke belt region have not been determined. Numerous possible contributing factors have been identified, including hypertension, low socioeconomic status, diet, cultural lifestyle, quality of healthcare facilities, smoking, and infections. Among the specific factors that have been proposed or studied are the following: 
Public health initiatives to reduce stroke incidence in the region.
The U.S. federal government has conducted public health programs specifically aimed at reducing stroke incidence and mortality in the stroke belt. In the 1990s the Stroke Belt Initiative operated in eleven stroke belt states, providing nutrition education, blood pressure screening, smoking cessation programs, weight loss programs, and other health promotion and public education initiatives targeted at stroke risk factors. 
In 2004, the Stroke Belt Elimination Initiative of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded grants aimed at reducing the high incidence of stroke and high rates of stroke death and disability in the seven states with the highest rates of stroke (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee).
Origins.
The term "stroke belt" is modeled after similar terms used for U.S. regions such as "snowbelt" and "Sun Belt", which extend the analogy to the belt as an article of clothing. The coastal plain counties of the Carolinas and Georgia — where the stroke belt phenomenon was first described, and where stroke incidence is highest — are sometimes called the "buckle of the stroke belt".

Nerepis River

The Nerepis River is a river approximately 25 miles long, located in New Brunswick, Canada. A popular river for canoeists and anglers, it is a tributary of the Saint John River. The river has been subjected to significant environmental stress over many years.
The river meets the Saint John River at Westfield, part of the Town of Grand Bay-Westfield, where it feeds a fresh water marsh. Towards the headwaters, it passes through the communities of Nerepis, Blagdon, Bayard, Welsford (where a tributary, Douglas Creek, tumbles into the river over a 15 metre waterfall), Fowlers Corners, Petersville, and New Jerusalem. The river also passes the 13th hole of the Welsford Golf Course. Most of the land it passes through is undeveloped although there has been extensive clear cutting in the upper reaches. The Nerepis River Watershed also drains part of CFB Gagetown.
Settlement.
The land came to be settled by Loyalists following the American Revolution. Lands were granted to those who had pleased the British. Among the recipients was Maj. John Coffin, a half-pay officer of the New York Volunteers and later a member of the Assembly in New Brunswick.
Water quality concerns.
Over many years, military practice manoeuvres at CFB Gagetown have degraded the water quality and affected fish habitat in the river and its tributaries. Since 1996, the base has been actively working to remedy the situation by hardening fords and stream approach routes. Perhaps more insidiously, the river was also exposed to dioxins from the use of Agent Orange and Agent Purple during secret tests in 1966 and 1967. Herbicides have also been sprayed on the base since 1952. However, a 2006 report found that “exposures to dioxin in soil, sediment and surface water in the Nerepis River area do not represent a potential concern for illness for the angler.”
The Nerepis Marsh, a fresh-water body of approximately one square mile in size, lies near the confluence of the Nerepis and the Saint John rivers.

The Marc Pease Experience

The Marc Pease Experience is a 2009 comedy film directed by Todd Louiso and written by Louiso and Jacob Koskoff. Shot primarily in and around Wilmington and New Hanover County, North Carolina in early 2007, the film is centered around Marc Pease, a man living in the past, when he was the star of his high school's musicals. The film stars Jason Schwartzman as Pease, Ben Stiller as Pease's former mentor, and Anna Kendrick as his love interest.
Plot.
In high school, Marc Pease (Jason Schwartzman) ran out on his performance as the Tin Man in a production of "The Wiz", succumbing to his stage fright despite his mentor Mr Gribble's (Ben Stiller) encouragement. Eight years later, he is dating Meg Brickman (Anna Kendrick), a high school senior who is bitter about being in the chorus and not having a principal role in Gribble's latest production of "The Wiz". Marc is keen for Gribble to produce the demo tape for his a cappella singing group Meridian 8 (which has already lost four of eight original members). Gribble, however, tries to avoid Marc, frustrated that Marc refuses to leave him alone because of the friendly advice he gave Marc eight years ago.
While tidying Meg's bedroom, Marc finds a tape labelled "Meg singing", but discovers after he listens to it that she is singing with Gribble, and at the end of the song, their noises suggest that they are having sex. Meg, meanwhile, begins to doubt Gribble's sincerity when he tells her what a terrific singer she is when she realizes that she is always in the chorus. Questioning whether she even enjoys singing, she decides to quit. Marc drives to a performance with Meridian 8, where the only way he can keep the group from splitting up is to lie that Gribble has given them the chance to record in a studio. After insisting that he should sing his Tin Man's song, he starts crying on stage, and is later forced to admit that Gribble has not yet responded to his request to produce the demo. That night, the opening night of "The Wiz", Marc is working as a chauffeur for a high school prom couple. After dropping them off and cutting off his frequently ridiculed ponytail, he arrives at the show in the interval. He unsuccessfully tries to discuss Meridian 8's demo with Gribble, who brushes him off, then learns from another bandmate that they are losing another member.
After hearing the Tin Man's song from outside the auditorium, Marc goes inside and drags Gribble out into an empty classroom. Marc confronts him about his empty promises for Meridian 8 to record in a studio. Gribble tells Marc that he is still living as if he were in high school, and an angered Marc threatens to play Meg's tape to the school principal and expose Gribble's affair with a student. As they fight, Marc accuses Gribble of denying Meg a main role as a means of revenge on him, and destroys the tape for Meg's sake. He then goes backstage and breaks up with Meg because she is too young for him. Seeing that the actor of the Wiz has injured himself, Marc takes his cape, runs onto the stage and sings the Wiz's song. Meg runs away but decides that she loves singing and returns to the stage. Marc's performance is met with cheers from the audience, and he is overjoyed.
One year later, having left exorcised his "Wizard of Oz" demons, Marc is working as a professional singer under the title "The Marc Pease Experience".
Production.
"The Marc Pease Experience" is Todd Louiso's second directorial project, having previously directed "Love Liza" (2002) and acted in minor roles in "High Fidelity" (2000), "Thank You for Smoking" (2006) and "Snakes on a Plane" (2006). Jason Schwartzman was signed to star in the film by February 2007, with Ben Stiller in talks. Final funding from Paramount Vantage and producer Michael London was received in early February, with production slated to start in March. Anna Kendrick's role in the film was announced in mid-April, after filming had begun.
Principal photography began on March 12, 2007 in the state of North Carolina, where the entirety of the film was shot. Various locations around Wilmington and New Hanover County were used for filming, including Wilmington's Eugene Ashley High School and the school's auditorium. Filming continued through March and into April. On the last day of shooting at Eugene Ashley High, Stiller presented the school's morning announcements.
A number of student interns from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington's Film Studies Department were actively involved in "The Marc Pease Experience"s production as part of their internship program. After principal photography was completed, during post-production Louiso "realized we needed to go back and add some stuff". The 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike began at this time, however, and so there was a delay of six months before the extra scenes could be scripted and filmed.
Release.
Due to the consolidation of Paramount Vantage into Paramount Pictures, its parent studio, in June 2008, "The Marc Pease Experience" had a limited release into ten U.S. markets on August 21, 2009. The film opened in San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami, Dallas, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Seattle, Sacramento, and Boston in what was described by Drew Taylor of "The Playlist" as only "an obligation by the studio to release the film theatrically".
Box office.
The film grossed US$3,000 from ten screens on its opening weekend with a per-screen average of only $300. By the end of its domestic run, the film had grossed $4,033 and an international addition of $386,551, totaling $390,584.
Critical reception.
Before the film's release, Alex Billington of FirstShowing.net dubbed it "the next "Rushmore"" — which also starred Jason Schwartzman in the lead — based on the similar character elements. 
In spite of this early buzz, however, critical response was overwhelmingly negative. Roger Ebert called it "badly written and inertly directed, with actors who don’t have a clue what drives their characters". The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin, in a "D+" review, asked, "Who could have guessed a concept as promising and long overdue as a musical Jason Schwartzman vehicle would lead to such a regrettable little nothing?"
"The Marc Pease Experience" currently holds a 17% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

<doc id="19566778" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19566778" title="Niketas Stethatos">
Niketas Stethatos

Niketas Stethatos (, ; c. 1005 – c. 1090) was a Byzantine mystic and theologian who is considered a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church. He was a follower of Symeon the New Theologian and wrote the most complete biography of Symeon, "Life of Symeon".
Life.
Niketas Stethatos was born c. 1005 and entered the Monastery of Stoudios in Constantinople at age fourteen. He became a close disciple of Symeon the New Theologian, eventually writing the most complete biography of his teacher, the "Life of Symeon". Niketas later became abbot of the Monastery of Stoudios. The sobriquet "Stethatos", meaning "courageous," was given to Niketas due to his speaking out against Constantine IX Monomachos having an illicit mistress.
Niketas Stethatos is credited with defending Symeon the New Theologian's teachings on hesychast prayer, which were considered subversive even by some eastern church authorities. Niketas gained the support of the Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius, who eventually won Symeon's canonization. Niketas later supported Michael Cerularius in 1054, taking part in the conflict that became the East-West Schism, writing anti-Latin treatises criticizing the use of unleavened bread, Sabbath fasting, and the celibacy of priests.
Writings.
Niketas' "Vita", or "Life of Symeon", is the most complete biography of Symeon the New Theologian—Niketas also acted as editor of Symeon's own writings and talks. An edition of Symeon's works was distributed by Niketas following a vision he had of Symeon. Niketas' personal works include polemical writings and treatises on the soul, on paradise, on the meaning of hierarchy, and on the limits of human life. He wrote an unpublished "hypotyposis" on the private spiritual life expected of the Stoudios monks. 
Another widely read work is his treatise on ascetic practices which are contained in the fourth volume of the English editions of the "Philokalia", the three "Centuries on Practical, Physical and Gnostic Chapters". The titles describe three main stages on the spiritual path: "praktiki" (practice of the commandments); "physiki" (meditation on the essence of creation); "gnosis" (the direct knowledge of God). Niketas wrote about many of the same themes as his teacher, Symeon, including: the experience of God as divine light; the importance of having a spiritual father; love for others being more important than prayer; the responsibility of those who have direct experience of God's grace to share it with others. He also wrote that a spiritual life is possible no matter one's outer circumstances—that one doesn't have to physically withdraw from the world, and that true renunciation is an inner practice. Niketas' attitude to the spiritual life is fundamentally positive, and that true sanctity is only a return, through grace, to man's natural condition. 
His most well known writings are on mystical theology—in addition to the writings in the "Philokalia", they include "On the Soul, On Paradise" and "On the Hierarchy". In his letters, he supports the views of his teacher Symeon, writing that any monk or priest who had the gift of spirit was the equal of a bishop. He also wrote a treatise "Against those who accuse the saints", speaking out against a current of belief during that time which said that it was no longer possible to become a saint.
Quotes.
"The rays of primordial Light that illumine purified souls with spiritual knowledge not only fill them with benediction and luminosity; they also, by means of the contemplation of the inner essences of created things, lead them up to the noetic heavens. The effects of the divine energy, however, do not stop here; they continue until through wisdom and through knowledge of indescribable things they unite purified souls with the One, bringing them out of a state of multiplicity into a state of oneness in Him."
— From the "Philokalia". "On Spiritual Knowledge, Love and the Perfection of Living", #21.
"The Spirit is light, life and peace. If consequently you are illumined by the Spirit your own life is imbued with peace and serenity. Because of this you are filled with the spiritual knowledge of created beings and the wisdom of the Logos; you are granted the intellect of Christ (cf. 1 Cor. 2:16); and you come to know the mysteries of God's kingdom (cf. Luke 8:10). Thus you penetrate into the depths of the Divine and daily from an untroubled and illumined heart you utter words of life for the benefit of others; for you yourself are full of benediction, since you have within you Goodness itself that utters things new and old (cf. Matt. 13:52)."

Pierre Bossier Mall is an enclosed shopping mall located at the intersection of Interstate 20 and Airline Drive (Louisiana Highway 3105) in Bossier City, Louisiana. The mall, as is the city it is located in, is named after early settler Pierre Bossier. The mall was purchased by General Growth Properties, who built and sold it in the 1980s, for $26 million in October 1998. It is currently owned and managed by Rouse Properties, one of the largest mall owners in the United States. Its anchor stores are J. C. Penney, Sears, Dillard's, and Stage (formerly Beall-Ladymon).
The mall banned smoking on June 1, 1994. 
In 2005, Shreveport newspaper "The Times" reported that Pierre Bossier Mall was one of two local malls to increase sales, bucking the national trends toward the decline of traditional enclosed malls. The mall faced increased competition from newer outdoor shopping centers such as the Louisiana Boardwalk but the hot, humid Louisiana summers helped to drive shopper to the air conditioned indoor mall. In mid-2012, Virginia College moved into an anchor spot vacated by Service Merchandise in 1999.
For mall walkers, a lap around the Pierre Bossier Mall including all the niches is a half mile.

Cruel Zinc Melodies

Cruel Zinc Melodies is the twelfth novel in Glen Cook's ongoing Garrett P.I. series. The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett.
Plot introduction.
Garrett is a hardboiled detective living in the city of TunFaire, a melting pot of different races, cultures, religions, and species. When people have problems, they often come to Garrett for help, but trouble has a way of finding Garrett on its own, whether he likes it or not.
Plot summary.
It's winter in TunFaire, and life has slowed down for Garrett (meaning work seldom intrudes to interrupt his beer drinking and lounging about), until a parade of lovely ladies led by his favorite fiery red-head makes its way through his door. The red-head in question is none other than Tinnie Tate, Garrett's girlfriend, and she's accompanied by Alyx Weider, sultry temptress and daughter of the local beer baron, and several other friends. It turns out the girls have aspirations to become an acting troupe for a new theater that Alyx's father, Max Weider, is building to keep his youngest daughter happy and to have a new vehicle for moving more of his product.
The trouble is that Max needs some help. It seems that construction of his theater, The World, is beset by ghosts, bugs, and break-ins. Garrett figures that this is pretty much a security job, and ends up bringing in some of the usual crew including Saucerhead Tharpe and even Winger.
Right off the bat, Garrett wraps up the break-in problem, as it seems that a gang of kids was trying their hand at the racketeering business. The ghosts and bugs present a bit more of a problem. It turns out that the bugs are of sorcerous origin and the result of some sorcerous experimentation by a group of kids from the Hill, led by Kip Prose. Worse yet, the bugs have been disturbing the sleep of a large entity from a bygone age that has been slumbering for eons beneath the ground that The World is being built upon.
With Garrett's knack for finding trouble, he ends up attracting attention from the Guard, Prince Rupert, and several nasty sorcerous types from The Hill. In the end, with the help of the The Dead Man, John Stretch and his telepathically controlled rats, and a smoldering hot sorceress called the Windwalker Furious Tide of Light, Garrett eliminates the bugs and makes contact with the dormant creature (through the ghostly form of Eleanor), convincing it to be careful of the humans and creatures living above it.

Fleurs Aerodrome was a parent aerodrome built on behalf of the Royal Australian Air Force near Penrith, New South Wales, Australia during World War II.
Construction started on the aerodrome in 1942 and was still under construction in 1944 as part of a proposal to base a United States Navy Fleet Air Wing in Sydney should the need arise. Initially planned with three runways, No.1 (5000 ft) and No. 3 (6000 ft) runways were serviceable, however construction of No. 2 runway (5000 ft) was abandoned. A total of eight aircraft dispersal hideouts were constructed and accommodation was a farm house and a former Civil Constructional Corps camp.
In 1969, Fleurs was considered as a site of the second airport for Sydney. The aerodrome is now utilised as precision ground-reflection antenna range operated by the University of Sydney, known as the Fleurs Radio Observatory.

<doc id="19566859" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19566859" title="Fort Jefferson, Florida">
Fort Jefferson, Florida

Fort Jefferson is a massive but unfinished coastal fortress. It is the largest masonry structure in the Americas, and is composed of over 16 million bricks. The Dry Tortugas are part of Monroe County, Florida, United States. The fort is located on Garden Key in the lower Florida Keys within the Dry Tortugas National Park, about west of the island of Key West.
Geography.
It is located at , its elevation .
History.
Construction.
In late December 1824 and early January 1825, about five years after Spain sold Florida to the United States for $5 million, U.S. Navy Commodore David Porter inspected the Dry Tortugas islands. He was on the lookout for a site for a naval station that would help suppress piracy in the Caribbean. Unimpressed with what he saw, he notified the Secretary of the Navy that the Dry Tortugas were unfit for any kind of naval establishment. He reported that they consist of small sand islands a little above the surface of the ocean, have no fresh water, scarcely enough land to place a fortification, and in any case are probably not solid enough to bear one.
While Commodore Porter thought the Dry Tortugas were unfit for a naval station, others in the U.S. government thought the islands were a good location for a lighthouse to guide ships around the area's reefs and small islands. A small island called Bush Key, later called Garden Key, was selected as the site for the lighthouse, which became known as Garden Key Light. Construction began in 1825 and was completed in 1826. The 65-foot lighthouse was constructed of brick with a whitewashed exterior. A small white cottage for the lighthouse keeper was constructed beside the lighthouse.
In May 1829, Commodore John Rodgers stopped at the Dry Tortugas to evaluate the anchorage. Contrary to Commodore Porter's experience, Rogers was delighted with what he found. The Dry Tortugas, he reported, consisted of 11 small keys and surrounding reefs and banks, over which the sea broke. There was an outer and an inner harbor. The former afforded a safe anchorage at all seasons, and was large enough to let a large number of ships ride at anchor. Of more importance, the inner harbor combined a sufficient depth of water for ships-of-the-line, with a narrow entrance of not more than 120 yards. Rogers said that if a hostile power should occupy the Dry Tortugas, United States shipping in the Gulf would be in deadly peril, and "nothing but absolute naval superiority" could prevail. However, if occupied and fortified by the U.S., the Dry Tortugas would constitute the "advance post" for a defense of the Gulf Coast.
A series of engineering studies and bureaucratic delays consumed the next 17 years, but the construction of Fort Jefferson (named after the third President, Thomas Jefferson) was finally begun on Garden Key in 1846. The new fort would be built so that the existing Garden Key lighthouse and the lighthouse keeper's cottage would be contained within the walls of the fort. The lighthouse would continue to serve a vital function in guiding ships through the waters of the Dry Tortugas Islands until the current metal light tower was installed atop an adjacent wall of the fort in 1876. The original brick lighthouse tower was taken down in 1877.
Design.
The design called for a four-tiered six-sided 1000 heavy-gun fort, with two sides measuring 415 feet, and four sides measuring 564 feet. The walls met at corner bastions, which are large projections designed to allow defensive fire along the faces of the walls they joined. The heavy guns were mounted inside the walls in a string of open casemates, or gunrooms, facing outward toward the sea through large openings called embrasures. Fort Jefferson was designed to be a massive gun platform, impervious to assault, and able to destroy any enemy ships foolhardy enough to come within range of its powerful guns.
Living quarters for soldiers and officers, gunpowder magazines, storehouses, and other buildings required to maintain the fort were located on the parade ground inside the fort's massive brick walls. The Army employed civilian machinists, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, general laborers, the resident prisoner population, and slaves to help construct the fort. By 1863, during the Civil War, the number of military convicts at Fort Jefferson had increased so significantly that slaves were no longer needed. At the time, there were 22 black slaves employed on the project.
Fort Jefferson's peak military population was 1,729. In addition, a number of officers brought their families, and a limited number of enlisted personnel brought wives who served as laundresses (typically four per company). There were also lighthouse keepers and their families, cooks, a civilian doctor and his family, and others. In all, there were close to 2,000 people at Fort Jefferson during its peak years.
In order to support such a large population in an area lacking fresh water, an innovative system of cisterns was built into the walls of the fort. Sand-filled columns were placed at regular intervals in the inner walls, spanning their height from the roof to the foundation. The columns were intended to filter rainwater from the rooftop for long-term storage in a series of underground chambers. However, the system was never used in practice, as the enormous weight of the outer walls caused them to subside; this created cracks in the cisterns, allowing seawater to contaminate the fresh water supply.
Active use: 1860s–1930s.
The fort remained in federal hands throughout the Civil War. With the end of hostilities in 1865, the fort's population declined to 1,013, consisting of 486 soldiers or civilians and 527 prisoners. The great majority of prisoners at Fort Jefferson were Army privates whose most common transgression had been desertion, while the most frequent transgression for the civilian prisoners was robbery. However, in July 1865 four special civilian prisoners arrived. These were Dr. Samuel Mudd, Edmund Spangler, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen, who had been convicted of conspiracy in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Construction of Fort Jefferson was still under way when Dr. Mudd and his fellow prisoners arrived, and continued throughout the time they were imprisoned there and for several years thereafter, but was never completely finished. Mudd provided much-praised medical care during a yellow fever epidemic at the fort in 1867 (which killed many prisoners including O'Laughlen), and was eventually pardoned by President Andrew Johnson and released. By 1888, the military usefulness of Fort Jefferson had waned, and the cost of maintaining the fort due to the effects of frequent hurricanes and the corrosive and debilitating tropical climate could no longer be justified. In 1888, the Army turned the fort over to the Marine Hospital Service to be operated as a quarantine station.
Park designation.
On January 4, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who visited the area by ship, designated the area as Fort Jefferson National Monument. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 10, 1970. On October 26, 1992 the Dry Tortugas, including Fort Jefferson, was established as a National Park. The islands still do not exhibit any standing fresh water or even seasonal streams, hence the name "dry". Owing to the potential difficulties of survival in such conditions, one of these islands was used as the location for filming a military survival film used to train aircraft personnel.
Accessibility.
Fort Jefferson can be reached by a daily ferry from Key West, as well as by chartered seaplane and private yacht. As a national park, camping is permitted on the beach. Visitors by ferry typically spend 4 hours on the island, which is enough time for a guided tour of the fort, lunch on the boat, and a swim (snorkel equipment provided) on the reef. The island has a gift shop but no food is available for visitors.

CT Chamaeleontis

CT Chamaeleontis (CT Cha) is a T Tauri star in the constellation of Chamaeleon. It has an apparent visual magnitude which varies between 12.31 and 12.43.
In 2006 and 2007, a faint companion was observed 2.7 arcseconds away from CT Chamaeleontis, using the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory. Since the object shares common proper motion with CT Chamaleontis, it is believed to be physically close to the star, with a projected separation of approximately 440 astronomical units. It is estimated to have a mass of approximately 17 Jupiter masses and is probably a brown dwarf. The companion has been designated "CT Chamaeleontis b".

Ten Sleep Mercantile

Ten Sleep Mercantile, also known as Ten Sleep Hardware, is an example of a typical small-town general store. Located in Ten Sleep, Wyoming, it has been the focal point of the town since it was built in 1905 by H.T. Church. Upon Church's death in 1918 the property was bought by Buffalo businessman and rancher Alex Healy in an agreement that brought the store under the control of Paul Frison. Frison, who later served as mayor of Ten Sleep and as a Wyoming state legislator, operated the store from 1918 to 1943.
Ten Sleep Mercantile is an example of the tall, narrow and deep commercial buildings commonly found in small American towns. The two story balloon frame building is the best preserved building of its kind in Ten Sleep. The building is clad in wood clapboards. The front facade features a rod-supported shed roofed porch sheltering display windows and a recessed double door. The second floor has three double-hung windows, while the top of the facade is capped with a simplified bracketed cornice. The side elevations feature a stepped parapet following the single-pitched main roof as it rises from the rear to the front. On the east side a covered stairway climbs to the second floor.
The interior is well preserved with a large, deep main room and a pressed tin ceiling and plastered walls. A row of arched columns support the second floor. The second floor originally comprised two large rooms for the live-in owners, now subdivided. An unfinished basement underlies all.
Paul Frison was significant as a local historian who was instrumental in promoting the Black and Yellow Trail, a tourist route on US 14 from Chicago to Yellowstone National Park running through Ten Sleep. The trail's name was derived from the fact that it linked the Black Hills and Yellowstone. Established in 1912, the route featured Ten Sleep Canyon, just to the east of the town.

Smyrna Public Library

The Smyrna Public Library is the only independent, city-operated library in the state of Georgia. It is located at 100 Village Green Circle in downtown Smyrna, Georgia. It is the only public library in the county which has not joined the Cobb County Public Library System.
The Smyrna Women's Club and the Smyrna Men's Club provided the original financing and co-sponsored the first library, which officially opened on September 15, 1936 with little more than 600 books. Most of the books were collected by young boys pulling their wagons from door to door asking for books. Some of these books remain part of the library collection and are on display. 
A single bookshelf in the Woman's Club located at the corner of Atlanta Road (old U.S. 41 and Georgia 3) and Powder Springs Street (old Georgia 5) was the home of Smyrna's first library collection. By 1938, 1,400 volumes were housed in their clubhouse, and in 1939 the Men's Club added a room to the Women's Clubhouse to accommodate the growing collection. This "new" library was located in the back of the Women's Club House. A part-time librarian administered the collection, and ongoing funding was a joint venture of local citizens' support, the city of Smyrna, and the U.S. federal government. 
The city council secured Works Projects Administration funds to help finance the project. The monthly income was 30 dollars: 20 from the WPA and five dollars from each of the clubs. This contract was renewed each year until the WPA was abolished in the 1940s. 
At that time the city of Smyrna, with help from the state and county boards of education continued to finance the library. The library was governed by a seven-member board of directors, and it continued to grow and have a prominent role in the community. In 1961 the city assumed full responsibility for funding the library and built a new library facility located on King Street. 
By 1986, the library was seriously overcrowded and the mayor and the city council recognized the need for a new facility. A new library was recognized as an integral part of the first phase of the city's downtown revitalization program. In 1991, the city opened a new facility. This nationally recognized building is based on the colonial Virginia capitol in Williamsburg. It features an open floorplan with large windows that provides a warm inviting atmosphere to 250,000 annual visitors. 
An educational and cultural resource for the residents, the library offers a wide variety of services to the community. The library collection has grown to over 130,000 items in a wide variety of formats. Books, audio books, DVDs, videotapes, music CDs, and government documents can all be checked-out by cardholders. There is free Internet access, and the library is a Wi-Fi hotspot. 
The library's reference collection has grown to over 8,000 volumes with special collections on military and genealogy. Access is also provided to over 200 computer databases through online subscriptions or on CD-ROM. The children's department presents more than 40 programs a month and was the recipient of the 2005 Georgia Library Association Eason Associates Program Award. 
The Friends of the Smyrna Library is one of the largest "Friends" groups in Georgia. They raise money for library activities and sponsor monthly adult speaker programs, a book discussion group, art exhibits, an annual dinner theatre and the Murder Goes South Mystery Festival.

<doc id="19567054" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19567054" title="Choi Jin-sil">
Choi Jin-sil

Choi Jin-Sil (December 24, 1968 – October 2, 2008) was a popular South Korean actress. She was considered one of the best actresses in South Korea, nicknamed "The Nation's Actress". She played leading roles in 18 movies and 20 television dramas and appeared in 140 commercials. She committed suicide by hanging on October 2, 2008, at her home in Seoul.
Early years.
Choi was born as the first child to her parents Choi Guk-Hyeon and Jeong Ok-Suk on 24 December 1968 in Seoul. Her mother separated from her father since 1985 and divorced him in 1998. She had a younger brother, Choi Jin-yeong who was an actor and singer. 
Her family was so poor that her mother once managed the household by running a pojangmacha (a small street stall selling foods). She dreamed of becoming a star to escape from the poverty. She said in talk shows her nickname during her school days was "Choisujebi" because she used to eat "sujebi" (a dumpling soup) instead of ordinary meals due to the home environment. Although she later became a high-paid model and actress, she was known for frugality, even receiving awards for her savings activity and frugality.
Career.
In 1987, Choi graduated from Seonil Girls' High School. She began in Korea's entertainment circles as an advertising film model. She began to gain celebrity in an advertising campaign for Samsung Electronics in which she acted as a newly wedded housewife.
Personal life.
In 1994, her former manager Bae Byeong-Su, who was an influential figure in the entertainment field, was murdered by her road manager. She was called in as a witness. The incident shocked the Korean public.
In 2000, her marriage to Cho Sung-Min received widespread attention in South Korea. Cho was a professional baseball player with the Yomiuri Giants of Japan. They first met on a television show in 1998. Choi gave birth to a son Hwan-Hee (2001) and a daughter Joon-Hee (2003).
In November 2002, Cho physically attacked Choi, who was then pregnant with their second child. In August 2004, Cho again assaulted her. In September 2004, Choi divorced him.
Choi took the parental rights and child custody over the children on condition of exempting Cho's debt to her mother and brother as well as dropping several charges against Cho. Cho could only visit his children regularly according to the mutual agreement.
In January 2008, the South Korean family register ("hoju") was changed. As a result, children could use their maternal family name when the family members wanted it. According to the changed register, her children changed their surname from "Cho" (paternal family name) to "Choi" (maternal family name).
After Choi's death, her mother managed the inheritance and took custody of the children.
Allegations of domestic violence.
In August 2004, Choi Jin-sil came forward and declared herself a victim of domestic violence. Subsequently the advertiser, Shinhan Engineering and Construction, claimed she did not keep her contractual obligation to "maintain dignity" because she disclosed to the public her bruised and swollen face which was caused by the violence of her then husband.
On June 4, 2009, the Supreme Court reversed a high court ruling that decided in favour of Choi in a compensation suit filed by the advertiser in 2004 against the actress, who was the model for its apartments. In handing down its ruling, the Supreme Court censured Choi for coming forward and declaring herself a victim of domestic violence, saying it constituted a failure to maintain proper "social and moral honour". Her two children became defendants as heirs.
On 9 June 2009, Korean Womenlink, the Korea Women's Hot Line, and the Korea Women's Association United issued a joint statement lambasting the ruling. Women's groups censured the Supreme Court for not realising the suffering of domestic violence victims, which included Choi. As to the ruling, the groups claimed that revealing the results of domestic violence was not a matter of "dignity" but a matter of "survival". "When a person is suffering, he or she needs to restore their dignity and social honour by disclosing the damage and seeking proper legal help as Choi did," a director of Korean Womenlink said.
Death.
Choi Jin-Sil committed suicide by hanging on 2 October 2008, at her home in Seoul. Her suicide was confirmed by the police. She was survived by her two children, her mother and younger brother Choi Jin-Young, who committed suicide a year and a half later. 
Choi's suicide triggered a temporary 70% increase in suicide in South Korea for about a month after her death; police recorded 700 more suicides in that month than would have been typical statistically.
Cause.
On 8 September 2008, Ahn Jae-hwan, the husband of popular comedian Jeong Sun-Hee, was found dead in his car. Ahn committed suicide apparently due to distress over mounting debts. Jeong and Choi had been close friends for a long time; at his funeral Choi appeared deeply shaken. Shortly after, rumours circulated on the web that Choi, as a loan shark, had lent a large sum of money to Ahn. On 22 September 2008, Choi sought a police probe into the source of the rumours, calling them groundless. On 28 September 2008, police arrested a securities company employee for spreading the rumours.
Choi came under greater stress amid rumours circulating on the Internet that she was involved in the suicide of fellow actor Ahn Jae-Hwan.
In response to Choi's death, the South Korean government tried to strengthen a legal push to regulate Internet postings. Politicians have reacted by proposing legislation that would impose a more rigorous real name registration requirement on the Internet and more heightened punishment for libelous statements.
Press reaction.
The news of her death was widely reported and large number of reporters rushed to Choi's house to cover the event. On the other hand major portal web sites blocked online users from leaving replies for articles concerning Choi, for fear that some users might leave malicious comments.
"Almost 80 percent of South Korea's households have broadband access, fostering active online interactions. Most Web sites here have bulletin boards where users can post uncensored, anonymous comments, and nearly all young people run their own blogs, updating via cellphone. Such sites were a major avenue for rumors about the possible dangers of dropping a ban on American beef that fed enormous street protests and political upheaval earlier this year. Major Web portals have in recent years doubled the number of monitors to screen out online character assassination and respond more quickly to complaints of malicious rumors. But many victims still complained that vicious rumors spread so fast their reputations were ruined virtually overnight," "The New York Times" commented on her death on October 2, 2008.
"She was more than South Korea's Julia Roberts or Angelina Jolie. For nearly 20 years, Choi was the country's cinematic sweetheart and as close to being a "national" actress as possible. But since her body was found on Oct. 2, an apparent suicide, she has become a symbol of the difficulties women face in this deeply conservative yet technologically savvy society. Incessant online gossip appears to have been largely to blame for her death. But it's also clear that public life as a single, working, divorced mom — still a pariah status in South Korea — was one role she had a lot of trouble with," "Time commented on her death on October 6, 2008.
Theft of urn.
On August 15, 2009, Choi's ashes were stolen from her burial site. The police hunt for a suspect was aided by surveillance camera images showing a man carrying out the theft. On August 25, 2009, the police arrested him and Choi's ashes were found in his home.
A small memorial park for Choi Jin-Sil has been built in a cemetery in Gyeonggi Province. Choi's ashes were placed in the new tomb in the park in the Gapsan Park Cemetery in Yangpyeong on September 28, 2009. Security devices have been installed to prevent a recurrence of the theft, with the tomb specially manufactured in China and more surveillance cameras placed around the tomb.
Choi Jin-sil Foundation.
Choi was the "big sister" who led the so-called "Choi Jin-Sil Association". It was a friendly group of close celebrities that included the comedians Lee Young-Ja and Jeong Sun-Hee, the models Hong Jin-Kyung and Lee So-Ra, and the actresses Choi Hwa-Jung and Uhm Jung-hwa. After Choi's death, they founded "The Choi Jin-Sil Foundation" for charity.
Drama synopsis.
The drama synopsis "As Life Goes On" (사노라면) which Choi Jin-Sil had written was found in her home after her death.

His father is Professor James E. Krier, a well-known legal scholar at the University of Michigan Law School and co-author of the widely used Dukeminier & Krier Property casebook.
In 1993, when he was 14, Andrew joined the band Slam, later to be called Reverse Polarity. His first public recording, "Mr. Surprise", came out on a compilation released by the Westside Audio Laboratories label (now known as Ypsilanti Records) out of Ypsilanti, Michigan. Over the next 5 years he was in many bands in Michigan such as Lab Lobotomy, The Pterodactyls, Music Band, Mr. Velocity Hopkins, Kathode, The Portly Boys, Kangoo, The Beast People, Stormy Rodent, a later iteration of Scheme, the Malt Lickers, Isis and Werewolves, and Sucking Coeds. In 1994 he also started a group called Ancient Art of Boar, later making it a solo project titled AAB, which ended in 1998, when Andrew moved from Ypsilanti to New York City.
Later in 1998, his first official solo record as Andrew Wilkes-Krier, titled "Room To Breathe", was released on the Brighton (later Ann Arbor) label Hanson Records. The release was cassette-only and only 35 copies were made. Another tape, titled "You Are What You Eat" was supposed to be released shortly after, but the masters went missing. That same year, he appeared on the Hanson Records compilation "Labyrinths & Jokes". The track appearing on the compilation was a portion of the soundtrack Andrew made for "Poltergeist", a movie made by Aaron Dilloway and himself. The whole soundtrack also went missing for over 10 years, but it too has recently re-surfaced.
In 2000, he released his first EP, "AWKGOJ" on Bulb Records, which would be the first solo release under the Andrew W.K. name (he appeared under the name on a Wolf Eyes EP earlier that year). He released one more EP on this label, "Party Til You Puke", before moving on to Island Def Jam.
Music career.
Andrew released his first album "I Get Wet" in 2001 on Island Records. The album is known for its cover art: a photo of Andrew W.K. with a stream of blood running from his nose onto his chin and neck. "I Get Wet" soon rose to the #1 position on Billboard's 'Heatseekers' list. Andrew W.K. joined Ozzy Osbourne's Ozzfest that summer. The track "Party Hard" was featured as the lead track for EA Sports video game "Madden NFL 2003" and on the "Girls Gone Wild Music Volume 1" CD, and is the subject of a popular internet meme (its repetition of the words "party hard" ad nauseam made it an ideal caption for animated .gif images). The opening track, "It's Time To Party", was featured in commercials for the video game "NASCAR Thunder 2004", Hotwire.com, Coors Beer, Expedia.com, and several movie and TV soundtracks. The song "Fun Night" was used in the Will Ferrell movie Old School. "She Is Beautiful" was used in the movies "Freaky Friday", ' and "Out Cold", as well as in early Nintendo GameCube advertisements. His track "Don't Stop Living in the Red" is featured in a Target commercial. The song has been played at the kickoff of every Saint John's football game since 2003 and whenever the Allen Americans of the Central Hockey League score a goal at home. It was also featured during KSDK-TV's coverage of the St. Louis Cardinals in 2005. In 2002, he and Alec Rominger re-recorded his song "We Want Fun" from "AWKGOJ" for the soundtrack of ' that also had a video made, filmed and directed by Jeff Tremaine with additional camera work by Spike Jonze.
In late 2003, W.K. released "The Wolf". The album featured Andrew playing all the instruments on the recording (he had his full live band play on "I Get Wet"). It spawned the singles "Tear it Up" and "Never Let Down" in the US (both had videos made, but only "Tear It Up" had a full retail single released) and the song "Long Live the Party" was a minor hit in Japan. "The Wolf" has many overdubbed instrument parts.
"The Wolf" was not as commercially successful as "I Get Wet". On tour for "The Wolf", Andrew was injured on stage and broke his foot. After the concert, he signed autographs from the ambulance. Not wanting to let his fans down, he performed the remainder of the tour in a wheelchair.
A live-concert DVD entitled "Who Knows?" was released in February 2006. Similar to his audio recording the DVD combined many sources into single events – a technique Andrew refers to as "Synch Stacking". Andrew presented five screenings of the movie in New York City and Hollywood, in February and April, 2006. He also attended a screening of the movie at the University of Michigan Law School, presented by his father.
In March 2006, during an episode of Sex Pistols' guitarist Steve Jones' radio show, "Jonesy's Jukebox", Andrew W.K. debuted a new song, "I'm A Vagabond". A different version of the song was eventually released as a square 7" single (with the songs, "Doing Andrew W.K." and "Let's Go on a Date" – released by BSM on February 15, 2010). "I'm A Vagabond" was also included on the "Mother of Mankind" rare and unreleased album (February, 2010).
On November 26, 2008, Universal Music released three new Andrew W.K. collections. The first CD was brand new album of J-Pop covers entitled, "The Japan Covers". The second CD is a Greatest Hits Compilation entitled, "The Very Best So Far", which includes a previously unreleased song, "Party (You Shout!)". Both new releases are also available as a combined 2-disc package entitled, "Premium Collection".
On September 9, 2009 Andrew W.K. released a Japan-only album called "Gundam Rock". The album consists of covered music from the legendary Gundam anime TV series to celebrate its 30th Anniversary in Japan.
On the same date, he also simultaneously released "55 Cadillac", an album of improvised piano pieces. Writing about the release of "55 Cadillac" Andrew wrote, "I wanted this new 55 CADILLAC album to sound like freedom. The sound of a piano being played by a free man – nothing more, nothing less."
On March 23, 2010, Andrew released a two disc set, "Close Calls With Brick Walls / Mother of Mankind". The two albums contain 39 tracks total, and come packaged in a slipcase. The "Close Calls With Brick Walls" album had originally been released in 2006, but only in Japan (by Universal Music Group), and in South Korea (by Dope Entertainment). A limited edition gatefold double vinyl LP version of "Close Calls With Brick Walls" was released in 2007 by the US label, Load Records. The "Mother of Mankind" album features rare and unreleased tracks spanning the years 1999 to 2010.
To accompany this set, it was announced he would be featured as a headliner at the 2010 Warped Tour for the entire tour. It will be his first time to do so, since 2002.
In June 2010 Andrew released a music video for the single "I Want To See You Go Wild" off the "Close Calls With Brick Walls" album. The video was made by director Peter Glantz. Later that year he appeared in A Day to Remember's video for "All I Want."

He accepted invitations to speak at Yale University, New York University, the University of Wisconsin, Carnegie Mellon University, the Cooper Union, Missouri Western State University, and Northeastern University.
During 2007, Andrew performed a series of unpredictable happenings as part of his "One Man Show" tour. Each event began with Andrew improvising on the piano alone on a stage before they frequently evolved into giant parties, with most of the audience dancing on stage with Andrew, themselves playing the piano and singing the lyrics.
In March 2007, "The New York Times" put Andrew on the front page of its Arts section, in a feature article on Andrew's lectures. In 2008, Andrew's self-help work led to his second appearance as a sit-down guest on "Late Night with Conan O'Brien". In November 2008, "Time" magazine called him "truly cute."
In June 2012, W.K. announced that he would be appearing at the "" fan convention Canterlot Gardens.

In September 2013, Andrew announced that his first book about partying, "The Party Bible," will be published by Simon & Schuster. The announcement, first broken on The A.V. Club, is accompanied by a video of the “Party Hard” rock icon’s physical and mental preparation for the literary task.
In January 2014, The Village Voice announced a new weekly advice column from Andrew called "Ask Andrew W.K." The column appears in the print edition of the paper, as well as Village Voice online.

Andrew is a frequent guest on the Fox News late-night program, "Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld".
Andrew has also been a featured interviewer and guest on "The Daily Show", "DirecTV", and mobile telephone network, GoTV.
Andrew also appears on the vocal-instructional DVD "The Zen of Screaming".
In the summer of 2009, the Cartoon Network announced that Andrew would be hosting and creating music for a new live-action TV program called, "Destroy Build Destroy". The show features Andrew working with two teams of teenagers, competing to "blow stuff up and use the wreckage to build amazing machines". The show premiered on June 20, 2009. The second season premiered on Wednesday, February 24, 2010 at 8:30PM, ranking #1 in their timeslot among boys 6–11 on all television. In early 2011, Cartoon Network confirmed they were beginning production on a third season of the show., which began airing on Wednesday, June 1, in its traditional 8:30pm time-slot.
Cartoon Network also used Andrew W.K. in a music video about the network's new live-action shows. The song and video, "Hearing What I Say" (adapted from Andrew's 2006 song, "Not Going to Bed") aired extensively on Cartoon Network and was available on YouTube. Later the clip was replaced by another bumper. In 2011, Andrew was part of a pyrotechnic stunt with motocross superstar Robbie Maddison performing a backflip on his motorcycle while Andrew presented the event for Cartoon Network's Hall of Game Awards.
Andrew had a cameo on Cartoon Network's "Mad", in the episode "Kung Fu Blander / Destroy Bob the Builder Destroy," which spoofed "Bob the Builder" and "Destroy Build Destroy".

Andrew also starred in "Lil BUB's Special Special" on Animal Planet alongside Lil Bub herself and Amy Sedaris. The TV special premiered on Saturday, February 8th at 9:00pm right after the "Too Cute" show.
Music producer.
In addition to producing his own music on the albums "I Get Wet", "The Wolf" and "Close Calls with Brick Walls", Andrew has continued to expand his musical output to include producing and mixing music for other artists as well as working on special commercial and corporate music projects. These include the production of music exclusively for commercial use on television and radio.
In 2008, Andrew gained new notoriety for recording a song called "The McLaughlin Groove", based on an exchange between Pat Buchanan and John McLaughlin on the political television show "The McLaughlin Group". The song was commissioned by the Public Radio International show "Fair Game", on which Andrew has appeared for interviews.
In 2004, Andrew recorded a television jingle for Kit Kat candy bars, and rewrote their trademark "Give Me A Break" slogan into a new song. The recording appeared in a variety of 30 second, 45 second, and 1 minute commercials, broadcast on television worldwide.
"I avoided working with other people for many years, partly out of paranoia, and partly out of an earnest desire to stand on my own. After a while, I got tired of thinking that way, and it just seemed natural to do the opposite of what I had done before. I like making music with other people. I can still make music by myself too.".
Andrew's earliest external production work was with the group Wolf Eyes, on their now out-of-print 12" EP "Fortune Dove". The last track on that album, "what kind of band?" features Andrew W.K. on vocals explaining why he enjoys listening to Wolf Eyes. Since then, he's chosen to work on a select and seemingly random set of projects. Most recently, he completed production and mixing on the album, "Through The Panama", by Brooklyn, NY based three-piece art rock band, Sightings. The album was jointly released by Load Records and Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace! label in October 2007.
At the end of 2007 Andrew accepted an invitation to produce a new album, "Repentance", for veteran reggae artist Lee "Scratch" Perry. The two had met when Andrew interviewed Perry for DirecTV. "Repentance" was nominated for "Best Reggae Album" in the 2009 Grammy Awards.
On February 20, 2008, Andrew released an exclusive ringtone commissioned by Universal Music Japan for the Japanese mobile phone market. The song is called, "Sonnna no Kankei Ne Rock", which celebrates a then popular catch-phrase by a TV Talent, "Sonna no Kankei Ne, Hai Oppappi!" This translates to, "I Don't Give A Damn, Yes Oppappi!" The ringtone was first announced on a Japanese national T.V. program called "Music Station" and had over 3,500 downloads that day. Cumulative sales of ringtone are over 20,000. Andrew's song debuted at No.1 in Label Mobile's International daily ringtone chart. Label Mobile is the biggest mobile retailer in Japan.
Nightclub and live music venue.
In Spring of 2008, Andrew and three partners opened a multi-level nightclub and live concert hall in downtown Manhattan, New York City. The venue is named Santos Party House, and features of dance floor and concert facilities, and over 150 loud-speakers. The space is designed for disco dancing and live music. It was one of the few new venues in New York City to be granted a liquor license and a cabaret license. The cabaret license means people can legally dance until 4am. Since opening, Santos Party House has received numerous awards, including: The People's Choice Award for Best Night Club, Best New Club, Best DJ Night (from Paper Magazine), Best New Dance Floor (from The Village Voice), and many more. In May 2009, Andrew and his work with Santos was the subject of an extensive four-page article in New York Magazine. In 2010, the world famous Zagat Survey rated Santos Party House the
"Top Dance Club" in all of New York City.
Record label.
In February 2009, Andrew found a loophole in his contractual constraints and formed the record label, "Skyscraper Music Maker", based in London, England and Manhattan, New York City, United States. The label is manufactured and distributed exclusively by the UK based, Cargo Records. The first release for the label was the promotional compilation CD, "DAMN! The Mixtape Vol. 1", featuring Andrew's work as a producer for Skyscraper Music Maker artists, Bad Brilliance, Aleister X, and Cherie Lily and music by New York producer, DJ B-Roc. The CD was released in the UK on May 25, 2009, and on digital download sites like iTunes and Amazon.
The second release on the Skyscraper Music Maker label was Andrew's album of "spontaneous solo piano improvisations", entitled "55 CADILLAC", on September 9, 2009. This was Andrew's first album made "by himself", as he told the UK newspaper, The Guardian.
The third release on the label was the debut 12" EP from artist, Aleister X. The EP was called "Bangers & Beans", and featured four songs written by Aleister X and produced by Andrew W.K. The EP was released on November 10, 2009. In May 2010, it was announced that Aleister X would be releasing a second EP, "The Git".
In late 2009, the Louise Harland Corporation (LHC) went into heated negotiations with Andrew's management and the owners of the first "Andrew W.K. record label", Skyscraper Music Maker, based in London, England. LHC fought to take control of the label, after Skycraper released Andrew's 2009 solo piano album, "55 Cadillac" – which was recorded with their involvement – but sold without their permission. LHC demanded credit on each future Skyscraper release, among other financial stipulations. As a result, the Skyscraper Music Maker label name was changed to "STEEV MIKE".
In March, 2010, the newly named STEEV MIKE label presented its first official release: the repackaged 2-disc version of Andrew's 2006 album, "Close Calls With Brick Walls". In September, 2010, it was announced that Cherie Lily would be releasing her debut EP "WERK", on the STEEV MIKE label, which features her original song and six remixes.
"Steev Mike" accusation.
Rumors suggest that another person, known as "Steev Mike", is behind Andrew W.K.'s music. The rumors began in late 2001 with the release of Andrew's first album, "I Get Wet", when music critics and industry insiders like Gary Mullholand (of the Guardian) and Ryan Schreiber (of Pitchfork) accused Andrew W.K. of being a corporate construction.
In late 2000, an article in UK magazine "Dazed & Confused" featured a full-page story on "Steev Mike", but showed a photo and discography of "Andrew W.K.". In April 2001, Bulb records (who had released the first AWK record), made a page with lots of references to Steev Mike where it would later be changed to "Andrew WK". The name, "Steev Mike" was listed as "Executive Producer" on Andrew's first album "I Get Wet" in 2001, and again in 2006 on Andrew's DVD "Who Knows" and third album, "Close Calls With Brick Walls". Steev Mike was not credited on the second album, "The Wolf", released in 2003.
A series of websites appeared in November 2004, supposedly created by someone calling himself "Steev Mike", consisting of easily decipherable coded messages. These messages included references to the Creative Artists Agency, a casting agency, and promises to reveal something. In the final message, a letter addressed directly to Andrew W.K., "Steev Mike" stated: "You know how much I believe in you and all that you stand for, because I stood for it first. You know how much I love your music, because I created it. You know that I love the way you look and act and talk and sing and dance because it was born in my brain." The message goes on to say: "Your recent efforts to exclude me from the 3rd album material will not be tolerated. I did not work for the last year on these new songs in order to have you break promises." and later: "If you refuse to comply, I will have no choice but to let the world know that you’re a backstabbing fraud."
Andrew W.K.'s official website also appeared to have been hacked during the same period, with someone leaving the same coded messages, taunting and insulting users.
It is unclear who was behind these messages, but they provoked a statement by Andrew himself, addressing the confusion, posted on his official website. In the statement, addressed "Dear everyone", he wrote, "PLEASE DON'T BELIEVE STEEV MIKE. I USED TO CALL MYSELF STEEV MIKE A LONG TIME AGO AND IT'S NOTHING NOW. Someone is trying to confuse you and make me look bad."
In May 2009 Andrew discussed the "Steev Mike" rumors once in an interview with British magazine, "Front". In the interview he stated, "Steev Mike is the executive producer on my first album. The nature of how we presented my initial offerings caused some confusion, even though I tried to make it as straightforward as possible". He also added, "most of what you've heard is exaggerated but the parts that are true may be more disturbing than you'd hoped".
According to corporate records filed with the Secretary of State of Michigan, "Andrew W.K. Inc." filed a certificate of assumed name on May 28, 2010 to transact business under the name "Steev Mike." Also according to corporate filings in Michigan, Andrew Wilkes-Krier is the president and sole officer of "Andrew W.K. Inc." and has been since the corporation's first annual report was filed in April 2000 if not earlier. "Andrew W.K. Inc." was formed in December 1999.
In an interview with MTV in January 2010, Andrew WK did his best to explain who "Steev Mike" is, noting that legal restraints prevent him from revealing everything: "The best way I can answer is Steev Mike is a name given to a group of people who don't want to be named."
Although Andrew W.K. has several accusations posed against him arguing that he is a fake entity, Wilkes-Krier has repeatedly denied these claims, frequently posting to social media outlets.
Legal disputes.
In September 2009, writing in the British newspaper, "The Guardian", Andrew apparently acknowledged the "Steev Mike" website hacking: "At the end of 2004, an old friend of mine got in some business trouble and basically decided to take it out on me. To cut a long story short, this person is someone I worked very closely with and had a formal and family business relationship with. Due to various complaints this person had with me, they were able to turn my life and career upside down. I wasn't allowed to use my own name within certain areas of the US entertainment industry and we were in a debate about who owned the rights to my image, and who should get credit for "inventing" it. This made my life complicated and intense for a few years, but I kept working and doing whatever I could to keep moving forward."
Andrew WK's third album, "Close Calls with Brick Walls" apparently suffered from legal problems, possibly relating to the ones mentioned above, and was only released in 2010, despite being ready for release in 2006.
In December 2009, a lecture recorded at Madame Jojo's in London in September 2008 was published online. During the lecture Andrew W.K. apparently addressed these claims, jokingly stating that the Andrew W.K. persona was created by a committee including himself, his father, and other individuals, and that he was the "next person playing Andrew W.K." Claiming, "I'm not the guy you've seen from the "I Get Wet" album... I'm not that same person. I don't just mean that in a philosophical or conceptual way. It's not the same person at all."
He went further on to say: "Andrew W.K. was created by a large group of people. They met, and I was there, and we talked about how we could come up with something that would move people. It was done in the spirit of commerce. It was done in the spirit of entertainment, which usually goes hand in hand with commerce. I was auditioned, along side many other people, to fill this role of a 'great frontman', 'a great performer'. On the one hand it may be a little scary to admit this to you all, that I may not be exactly who you thought I was, and that the guy who was, in fact, first hired as Andrew W.K. is a different person than the guy sitting here on the stage tonight. I'm the next person who is playing Andrew W.K."
Finally, in an interview before the performance he said, "I thought it would be more interesting if my secret history was revealed after the fact rather than as a precursor".
On January 3, 2010, apparently in response to criticism to his previous statements, Andrew W.K. published an article on his official website declaring, "I am a real person who thinks for himself and am not the victim of anyone or group of people trying to influence my career or life. I take responsibility for everything in my life, including who I work for and what happens to me because of it. Just because a person has mentors or advisers doesn't mean they don't have their own brain and soul. And just because I work with other people who advise me doesn't mean that I am a puppet for an evil cult or have some sort of master plan."

The Assembly of Gods is a fifteenth-century dream vision poem by an unknown author (it was originally attributed to John Lydgate, but scholars now agree that is unlikely that he wrote it). The poem, which includes many of the standard allegorical forms of its day, was quite popular when it was first published in printed form by Wynken de Worde, but has since fallen out of favor.
Summary.
"The Assembly of Gods" is composed of 301 seven line stanzas which have the standard "ababbcc" rhyme pattern of the rhyme royal. The meter, as critics have noted, is irregular. It can be broken into five main sections: an introduction, three distinct but connected narrative episodes and a conclusion.
In the introduction, the poet establishes the setting using conventional astrological and geographical references which place the poem within the traditional framework of a dream poem and introduces the dreamer who sits “all solytary alone besyde a lake,/ Musyng on a maner how that I myght make/ Reason & Sensualyte in oon to acorde” (1). But, before he can think through his puzzle he is overcome by sleep. Morpheus comes and escorts him to the court of Minos which is being held at the estate of Pluto. There the dreamer watches as Diana and Neptune accuse Aeolus of flouting their authority and discrediting them in the eyes of their worshippers. Before the trial can be concluded a messenger comes from Apollo, asking Minos to hold off on the judgement and inviting all the gods to his palace for a banquet. In Apollo’s palace, Diana’s complaint is resolved and the dreamer describes each of the gods and goddesses as they sit down to eat. The gods won’t allow Discord into their feast, but as she is leaving she meets with Atropos and sends him to stir things up. Atropos goes to the gods and complains that while the gods claim to have given him power to bring death to any who disobeyed or despised them, there is one person who has escaped his power. He threatens to leave their employ if they don’t make good on their promise to him and give him power over this person. All the gods agree that they will bring down this one who defies Atropos. They quickly resolve the dispute between Neptune and Aeolus to ensure that the offender will not be able to escape in the sea or air and then ask who it is that has defied them. When Atropos tells them that it is Virtue, Pluto says he knows him well and the only thing that can harm Virtue is Vice, Pluto’s bastard son. Vice is called for, and he assembles his host for battle. Morpheus warns Virtue of the impending battle and Virtue prepares his host and heads to the field of Microcosm, hoping to arrive before Vice and thus have the advantage. The descriptions of the assembly of these armies are made up long lists of characters representing various vices and virtues and types of people under the influence of Vice and Virtue.
The second narrative episode of the poem is a psychomachian battle between the hosts of Virtue and Vice for the field of Microcosm, which is possessed by Freewill. As the battle heats up, Freewill joins forces with Vice and they begin to drive Virtue and his host from the field. Perseverance comes and rallies Virtue’s troops, defeats Vice and wins the field. Freewill goes through a process of cleansing and is made a vassal of Virtue. Reason and Sadness are given control of Microcosm and set about cleansing it of the weeds planted there by Sensuality. A disgusted Atropos determines to leave the service of the “counterfete” gods saying, “For oo God ther ys that can euery dell / Turne as hym lyst, bothe dry & whete, / In to whos seruyce I shall assay to gete” (39). He goes in search of the Lord of Light and is told by Righteousness that the Lord of Light has been his master all along. Atropos’ name is changed to Death and he is sent to Microcosm. Priesthood and the sacraments are sent to the field to prepare it for the coming of Death who causes the grass to wither and shuts the gates on the field. 
The third episode of the poem takes place in the arbor of Doctrine where the dreamer is taken to be instructed in the meaning of the vision he has seen. The walls of the arbor are painted with images of people from the history of the world which Doctrine uses to explain the meaning of the dream and the genesis of the pagan deities and to encourage the dreamer in the right way of life. When she is done, the dreamer remembers his question about the accord of reason and sensuality and he asks her to “determyne that doute” (56). She is surprised that he has not figured it out yet, and with that, Death appears. As the dreamer hides in fear of Death, Reason and Sensuality appear and agree that people should fear death. 
After Doctrine explains this accord to the dreamer he is taken back to his spot by the lake. He awakens and writes his dream, exhorting those who read it, hear it read or see it to learn from it and asking the blessings of heaven on those who do.
Authorship and date.
The authorship and the exact date and of the poem are unknown though both questions have enjoyed considerable speculation. In his first printing of the poem, de Worde added the colophon ‘Thus endeth this lytyll moralized treatyse compiled by dan Iohn Lydgat somtyme monke of Bury on whose soule have mercy.’ He removed the colophon in later printings, but early catalogers of the poem perpetuated the attribution of the poem to Lydgate (Lydgate "Assembly" xi). Triggs argued for Lydgate’s authorship in his introduction, but scholars since that time have challenged the attribution so convincingly that the poem is no longer considered part of the Lydgate canon.
The belief that Lydgate was the author of the poem heavily influenced early attempts to fix a date for the writing of the poem, as scholars speculated about which period of Lydgate’s writings the poem seemed most likely to have come from. More recent attempts to fix the date of the poem suggest that it was probably written after Lydgate’s death, in the second half of the fifteenth century.
Manuscripts.
"The Assembly of Gods" exists in two early manuscripts, which Triggs calls Text A and Text B, and in several early printed versions of which the first was done in 1498 by Wynken de Worde. Differences between versions suggest that Text A was the source for the printed versions and that Text B was copied from one of them. The multiple printings of the poem at the end of the 15th and into the 16th centuries indicate the early popularity it enjoyed.
Title.
Text A originally contained no title for the work. Each printing and cataloguing seems to have used a slightly different title for the poem, including "The Assemble of Goddis and Goddesses", "The Interpretation of the names of Goddes and Goddesses", "Banket of Gods and Goddesses with a discourse on Reason and Sensualitie", and "Discord between Reason and Sensualitie" (Lydgate x-xi). Since the publication of Triggs' edition, "The Assembly of Gods" has been the title used most commonly for the work, though some recent scholars have used the title "The Assembly of the Gods".
Critical response.
J. Schick seems to have aroused a renewed modern interest in the poem toward the end of the nineteenth century. In his introduction to Lydgate’s "Temple of Glas" (1891) he mentions "The Assembly of Gods" in his “Chronology of Lydgate’s Writings” (cix-cx) and in his discussion of sources that Lydgate drew on in his works (cxvii). He raises the question of whether Lydgate wrote the poem or not, talks briefly about the manuscript and printings and connects the poem with Prudentius’ "Psychomachia". It is his work that encouraged Oscar Lovell Triggs to make his edition of the poem for the Early English Text Society.
Triggs’ 1896 edition of "The Assembly of Gods" provides the most thorough discussion of the poem. He addresses questions of manuscripts (vii-x), title (x-xi), authorship and date (xi-xiv), meter (xiv-xx), rhyme (xxi-xxix, xxx-xxxiv), alliteration (xxix-xxx), language (xxxv-xxxvii) and thematic elements and motifs (xxxvii-lxxvi). His notes (62-94) serve primarily to connect phrases and ideas from the poem with other literature of the time. His work also includes catalogues of characters (95-105), a glossary (106-114) and a collection of special phrases and proverbs found in the poem (115-16). His discussion of the poem focuses on the way that it fits into the history of English literature and its use of common motifs and techniques. Triggs’ belief that the poem was written by Lydgate directly influences many of his arguments, but his work on the formal elements of the poem is valuable and his discussion of the conventional motifs is interesting and insightful. 
In 1897, Frederick Klaeber wrote a review of Triggs’ book which is generally positive with regard to Dr. Triggs and negative with regard to the merits of the poem. He briefly discusses some formal elements of the poem.
Albert Rudolph wrote a short work in 1909 that compares the style of "The Assembly of Gods" with that of works by Lydgate and argues that Lydgate was not the author of "The Assembly of Gods". 
In "The Allegory of Love" (1936) C. S. Lewis briefly describes "The Assembly of Gods" as “a psychomachia with trimmings” (260). He writes of the vivacity of the poem and of the “clumsy, honest poet; who was certainly not Lydgate if we judge by his metre” (262). The discussion of the poem is brief, focuses on the second episode and doesn’t address the main themes of the poem in any depth.
In "The Seven Deadly Sins" (1952) Morton Bloomfield mentions the poem and connects the description of the gods in the first section with alchemy, but still focuses his attention on the second section of the poem. He concludes his discussion of the poem, “Although the poetry is weak, the Assembly on Gods is historically a very important example of the psychomachia theme. The battle theme . . . is handled by the author with a deftness and attractiveness which even the limping poetry and long lists of sub sins cannot entirely mar” (228). 
Spivack also briefly mentions the poem in connection with psychomachia literature and the morality plays of the late Middle Ages (1958). This connection is referenced in Potter’s important work on morality drama (1975), but neither author talks about the poem in any detail. 
Curt F. Bühler wrote an article in 1967 for "English Language Notes" that connects the poem’s use of the goddess Othea with Christine de Pisan’s "Epître d’Othéa". He notes some similarities in the way that the two works describe and explain the pagan deities they include. 
In 1971 Pamela Gradon used "The Assembly of Gods" as an example in her discussion of the way that late medieval literature relied on shallow, static visual images and contrasts it directly with the depth and immediacy of the characters in the "Psychomachia" and the depth of meaning of the beasts in the opening of Dante’s "Divine Comedy" (62-63). She also compares the way that the poem uses visual representations to "The Romance of the Rose" and Dante’s "Purgatorio" (369-373).
Philippa Tristram (1976) briefly mentions the poem’s treatment of the question of predestination (144-145) and the relationship between Death and Nature (179). 
Alain Renoir and C. David Benson (1980) included "The Assembly of Gods" in their list of Lydgate’s works. They include a plot summary and say that the poem “reflects most of the conventions of its genre as well as reflecting a typical Christian attitude toward the ancient gods” (1817). 
In 1988, Jennifer O’Reilly included "The Assembly of Gods" in her discussion of the development of the medieval treatment of the virtues and vices. She reasserts the connection to the "Psychomachia" (59-61) and uses "The Assembly of Gods" as an example of the importance of penance and perseverance in late medieval works (304-305). 
A. S. G. Edwards and C. M. Meale make brief mention of the transmission of the manuscript in their article on medieval book marketing (123-124). 
In 1999, Jane Chance edited an edition of "The Assembly of Gods" with extensive notes and a thorough introduction. A review of the work by Roberta Davidson suggests that Chance's introduction focuses on what she sees as feminine elements in the poem and on the connection to Christine de Pisan’s "Epître d’Othéa".

The Lions of Lucerne (novel)

The Lions of Lucerne is a spy novel published in 2002 and written by American novelist Brad Thor. 
Plot.
The work is Thor's first novel with the character of Scot Harvath, an ex-Navy SEAL and current U.S. Secret Service agent. Harvath survives an attack which leaves 30 of his fellow agents dead and the president of the United States kidnapped. He begins a search for those responsible and attempts to rescue the president.
Reviews.
Reviews for the book were mixed. Publishing industry trade magazines were generally negative. "Publishers Weekly" wrote "it's hard to get past the novel's many graceless shortcomings, cliched language [...], cartoonish scenes and a protagonist whose superhero character desperately needs fleshing out." A reviewer for "Kirkus Reviews" called Thor's prose "tangled" at times.
Other media, notably regional titles, were more positive. "The Anniston Star" wrote that Thor had recreated "a genre that has been firmly in the grasp of Tom Clancy for so long is not an easy feat. Fortunately for military intrigue devotees, Brad Thor has done just that — and on his first time out too." The "Tacoma Reporter" wrote "this book is one of the best entries into the military thriller genre since the early works of Tom Clancy" and that Harvath "will definitely take a place beside Cussler's Dirk Pitt and Clancy's Jack Ryan."

Hemavati (raga)

Hemavati (pronounced hēmavati) is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 58th "Melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music.
It is called Simhāravam or Deshi Simhāravam in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music. It is said to be borrowed into Hindustani music from Carnatic music, especially with instrumentalists.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 4th rāgam in the 10th "chakra Disi". The mnemonic name is "Disi-Bhu". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ri gi mi pa dhi ni". Its structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
As it is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "prati madhyamam" equivalent of "Kharaharapriya", which is the 22nd "melakarta".
"Janya" rāgams.
"Hemavati" has a few minor "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See List of "janya" rāgams to view all rāgams associated with "Hemavati".
Compositions.
Here are a few common compositions sung in concerts, set to "Hemavati".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Hemavati's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 3 other major "melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Keeravani", "Vakulabharanam" and "Kosalam". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam.

Pangea Resources

Pangea Resources Australia Pty Ltd was a company notable for a controversial proposal for an international high-level radioactive waste repository in Australia.
Pangea Resources was a joint venture of British Nuclear Fuels Limited, Golder Associates and Swiss radioactive waste management entity Nagra.
In 1998-1999 it put forward a proposal for a high level radioactive waste repository to be built in remote central Australia. The proposal was highly controversial, and elicited opposition from Australian state and federal parliaments. This included actions by two parliaments to prevent the progress of such a proposal. These were the Western Australian Parliament's passage of the "Nuclear Waste Storage (Prohibition) Act 1999", and the South Australian Parliament's implementation of the "Nuclear Waste Storage Facility (Prohibition) Act 2000".
The anti-nuclear movement in Australia lobbied against the idea of such a facility. When the federal minister responsible for the issue, Minister for Industry Science and Resources Senator Nick Minchin, indicated that ‘the Pangea proposal will go nowhere’, Pangea ultimately abandoned its advocacy.

Nintendo DSi

The Nintendo DSi () is a dual-screen handheld game console released by Nintendo. The console launched in Japan on November 1, 2008, and worldwide beginning in April 2009. It is the third iteration of the Nintendo DS, and its primary market rival is Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP). The fourth iteration, entitled Nintendo DSi XL, is a larger model that launched in Japan on November 21, 2009, and worldwide beginning in March 2010. Development of the DSi began in late 2006, and the handheld was unveiled during an October 2008 Nintendo conference in Tokyo. Consumer demand convinced Nintendo to produce a slimmer handheld with larger screens than the DS Lite. Consequently, Nintendo removed the Game Boy Advance (GBA) cartridge slot to improve portability without sacrificing durability.
While the DSi's design is similar to that of the DS Lite, it features two digital cameras, supports internal and external content storage, and connects to an online store called the Nintendo DSi Shop. Nintendo stated that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles. Its new functionality was intended to facilitate personalization, so as to encourage each member of a household to purchase a DSi. The handheld supports exclusive physical media in addition to DS games with DSi-specific features and standard DS titles. The only exception to its backward compatibility are earlier DS games that required the GBA slot. As of June 2013, Nintendo had sold over 41 million DSi and DSi XL units combined.
Reviews of the Nintendo DSi were generally positive; although IGN and "bit-tech" decried the console's lack of exclusive software and removal of the GBA cartridge slot, its added functionality caused many journalists to recommend it to those who had not purchased a previous DS model. Numerous critics were disappointed with the limited resolution of DSi's cameras, though others such as Ars Technica and GameSpot agreed they were adequate for the handheld's display. CNET and "PCWorld" considered the DSi Shop to be the most important buying incentive for current DS owners. Some critics believed the DSi XL was not an essential upgrade. "GamePro" and "Wired UK", on the other hand, praised the DSi XL's larger screens for improving the gaming experience and revitalizing older DS games.
History.
Development.
Development of the Nintendo DSi started at the end of 2006. It was the first time Masato Kuwahara of Nintendo's Development Engineering Department served as a hardware project leader. Work went at a quick pace to meet deadlines; his team had to devise a theme for the new DS in time for a late December presentation, and by February 2007, most specifications for a chipset had to be completed. Kuwahara reported that his team had difficulty determining the potential market for the handheld during the design process; he said of their goal, "We have to be able to sell the console on its own games at launch. It also has to be able to meld into the already-existing DS market." The console's digital cameras were considered early in development: Nintendo president and Chief Executive Officer Satoru Iwata described the touchscreen as the Nintendo DS's sense of touch, and the microphone as its "ears"; a co-worker suggested that it should have "eyes". Kuwahara's team originally wanted one camera with a swivel mechanism, but this was abandoned due to concerns of reliability, cost, and the need of a thicker console. Owing to consumer demand, Nintendo also improved the handhelds' volume and audio quality and made it slimmer with larger screens compared to the Nintendo DS Lite. However, to improve portability without sacrificing durability, the GBA cartridge slot present on earlier models was removed. To compensate, Nintendo continued to support the DS Lite as long as there was consumer demand for it.
The DSi's size was changed midway through development, delaying its release. Its original design included two DS game card slots, because of demand from both fan communities and Nintendo employees, which consequently made it larger. When the console's designs were unveiled to Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development producers in October 2007, it was met with lukewarm reception due to its size. However, Iwata and Kuwahara's own hopes resulted in the creation of a prototype. A quick hands-on investigation led them to abandon the dual-slot design, which made the DSi approximately slimmer. Ever since the handheld's in-company unveiling, its internal designs were finished along with assembly and durability specifications. Iwata described having to resize the console so close to manufacturing as being essentially the same as making another handheld.
Yui Ehara, designer of the DS Lite and DSi's original casing, had to redesign the revised case. He advocated changing the six speaker apertures, as their circular perforations were redundant to the rest of the handheld's interface. He believed that this alteration also signaled a clearer distinction between the DSi and its predecessors while keeping the unit "neat" and "simple". Ehara hoped the DSi's added features would not interfere with his desired iconic image of the Nintendo DS product line: two rectangles, one on top of the other, with each half containing another rectangle inside. This model was publicly revealed at the October 2008 Nintendo Conference in Tokyo, along with its Japanese price and release date. While the DS product line's worldwide yearly sales figures consistently surpassed those of its primary market rival, Sony's PlayStation Portable, demand for it in Japan was decreasing; Nintendo's launch of the DSi was intended to stimulate sales. The company was less concerned with releasing the DSi in other territories, where DS Lite market demand remained high.
Development of a large DS Lite model in 2007 eventually led to the DSi XL (known in Japan as the ). Nintendo had designed a large DS Lite model with screens, compared to the standard screens; development of this new handheld advanced far enough that it could have begun mass production. However, Iwata placed the project on hold due to consumer demand for the DS Lite and Wii. He later pitched the idea of simultaneously releasing large and small versions of the DSi instead, but Nintendo's hardware team was incapable of developing two models concurrently. After finishing work on the DSi, Kuwahara started the DSi XL project and became project leader. The DSi XL, a DSi model with screens, was announced on October 29, 2009. Various names for it were considered, including "DSi Comfort", "DSi Executive", "DSi Premium", "DSi Living", and "DSi Deka" (Japanese for "large"). "Mario" creator Shigeru Miyamoto insisted on "DSi Deka". The handheld has an improved viewing angle over its predecessor, which allows onlookers to see the screen's contents more easily. This feature was absent from the large DS Lite model due to cost issues at the time, which also limited LCD screen size. The cost of LCD screens is determined by how many pieces are cut from a single large glass sheet. To keep these costs within a certain threshold, Nintendo set a screen size limit of approximately , which was later increased to .
Launch.
On November 1, 2008, the DSi was released in Japan; on April 2, 2009, in Australia and New Zealand, and on April 3 in Europe, all with a black and white casing. It launched in the United States and Canada on April 5, alongside the game "Rhythm Heaven". It was the first DS console to launch with multiple colors in North America—black and blue. iQue released a Chinese DSi model in black and white, with a pre-installed version of "Nintendogs", in December 2009; the "Nikkei Sangyo Shimbun" reported that the Chinese and Korean models featured improved security, to combat piracy. On April 15, 2010, the DSi was launched in South Korea in white, black, blue, and pink, alongside the game "MapleStory DS". "MapleStory DS" was also bundled with a red limited-edition DSi, which had characters from the game printed around its external camera. Other countries the DSi was released in include Brazil, Russia, and Turkey.
Nintendo had shipped 200,000 units for the DSi's Japanese launch, and during its first two days on sale, over 170,000 units were sold—the remaining units were either unclaimed pre-orders or reserved for sale on Culture Day. By the end of the month, the DSi sold 535,000 units, in comparison to 550,000 DS Lites sold in its launch month. In the two-day launch period, Europe and North American sales totaled 600,000 units combined. North American first week sales almost doubled the DS Lite's 226,000 units by selling 435,000. In the UK, the console totaled 92,000 sales within two days of release, which GfK/Chart-Track data showed to be the fourth-best opening weekend ever in the region—higher than previous records set by other DS iterations.
DSi launch events were held on the western and eastern coasts of the United States. Nintendo sponsored an official launch event at the Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles and the Nintendo World Store in New York City. The LA midnight launch party featured several events, including merchandise handouts, signings and art galleries from iam8bit, parkour demonstrations, and performances by Gym Class Heroes. Hundreds attended and over 150 stayed until midnight to purchase a unit at GameStop. A human-sized Lego DSi by artist Sean Kenney was on display at the Nintendo World Store.
The Nintendo DSi XL was released in Japan on November 21, 2009, in bronze, burgundy, and white. The former two colors were available for its European launch on March 5, 2010, and its North American launch on March 28. The console launched in Australia on April 15, 2010, in bronze and burgundy. The DSi XL was released in other countries including Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey. Over 100,500 units were sold during the console's first two days on sale in Japan, and 141,000 units were sold during its first three days in the United States.
The 2011 release of the Nintendo 3DS, the successor to the Nintendo DS series of handhelds, was announced on March 23, 2010, to preempt impending news leaks by the Japanese press and to attract potential attendees to the Electronic Entertainment Expo. According to industry analysts, the timing drew attention from the North American launch of the DSi XL. M2 Research senior analyst Billy Pigeon argued the "XL is old news ... in Japan – and Nintendo is a very Japan-centric organization. This is just the corporate parent in Japan maybe not acting in the best interest of Nintendo of America." Iwata dismissed any significant impact when speaking to concerned investors, "those who are eager to buy Nintendo 3DS right after the announcement generally tend to react quickly to anything new on the market, and those who are purchasing a Nintendo DS today tend to react relatively slowly."
Demographic and sales.
Nintendo targeted a wider demographic profile with the first Nintendo DS (2004) than it had with the Game Boy line. Comparing 2008 life-to-date DS and DS Lite sales to the best-selling game console, Sony's PlayStation 2, showed potential in further expanding the Nintendo DS gaming population—particularly in Europe and the United States. To further promote the product line while expanding its gaming population, Nintendo created the DSi. Iwata has said that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles, so to encourage each family member to buy an individual handheld, Nintendo added personalization features to the DSi.
The "i" in DSi symbolizes both an individual person (I) and the handheld's cameras (eyes); the former meaning contrasts with the "i"'s in Wii, which represent players gathering together. Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime said, "If Wii was about gaming for the masses, then think of DSi as creativity for the masses." Iwata has said that the DSi is meant to be a first camera for children, and a social networking device for adults. In response to media commentary following the DSi's announcement, Iwata insisted that its new audio and camera capabilities are not meant to compete with mobile phones, the iPod, or the PSP. He explained their role in the marketplace:
The DSi helped maintain strong sales for Nintendo's handheld product line. The DSi accounted for 40 percent of its product line's 2009 UK sales and frequently topped weekly sales charts in Japan during its first year of availability. In the United States, the console's initial three-month sales surpassed those of the DS, DS Lite, and Wii. Average weekly sales of the Wii and Nintendo DS declined slightly in March; Nintendo DS hardware sales stabilized at over 200,000 units for seven months after the DSi's April launch, while Wii sales diminished. Gamasutra estimated that, in October 2009 and February 2010, 50 percent of Nintendo DS unit sales were DSi consoles. In an October 2009 interview, Fils-Aime announced that the DSi had sold 2.2 million units in the United States. He said, "If you give the consumer great value in terms of what they pay, they're willing to spend, and we say based on the experience of launching the DSi". The United States had its highest yearly DS sales in 2009 with 11.22 million units sold. The DSi and DSi XL accounted for 16.88 million of the 27.11 million units sold worldwide of its product line for Nintendo's 2009 fiscal year beginning April 1, 2009 and ending March 31, 2010.
In Gamasutra's United States hardware sales estimate for July 2010, the DSi and DSi XL each outsold the DS Lite. The website reported DSi sales of approximately 300,000 units in July 2009 and February 2010, which remains consistent for July 2010 if combined with DSi XL sales. As a result, the average price consumers were spending on the Nintendo DS hardware family rose to over $165 (in 2004 dollars, $ adjusted for inflation as of 2010), which is over $15 more than the November 2004 launch price of the original Nintendo DS. Nintendo made its first DSi price cuts in Europe on June 18, 2010, for DSi and DSi XL consoles in Japan on June 19, and in North America on September 12. The DSi and DSi XL accounted for 14.66 million of the 17.52 million units sold worldwide of its product line in fiscal year 2010.
In a United States hardware sales estimate for July 2011 by Gamasutra following the DS Lite's price drop a month earlier, about 60 to 70 percent of approximately 290,000 DS units sold were DSi and DSi XL consoles. Lackluster 3DS sales forced Nintendo to drop its price to match the DSi XL in the United States on August 12. Japan and Europe had similar price reductions. Gamasutra speculated potential DS buyers in the United States opted for the 3DS as a result; DS sales for August 2011 decreased by 45 percent, while it combined with 3DS sales remained steady compared to the previous month. Nintendo made its second DSi and DSi XL price cuts in North America on May 20, 2012. Gamasutra called these price cuts the DS product line's "final send-off" and expects "by this time next year its contributions to the market will be minuscule. After Christmas, Nintendo will effectively be a single-handheld system company, putting all of portable software efforts into the Nintendo 3DS."
Hardware.
The Nintendo DSi's design is similar to that of the second DS iteration, the Nintendo DS Lite. It is approximately 12 percent shorter () than the Nintendo DS Lite when closed, but slightly wider and lighter. The DSi has two TFT-LCD screens— larger than those of previous models—that are capable of displaying 262,144 colors. The touch sensitive lower screen accepts input from the included stylus. The handheld features four lettered buttons (X, Y, A, B), a directional pad, and Start, Select, and Power buttons. Two shoulder buttons, a game card slot, and a power cable input are placed under the console's hinge. The included AC adapter is not compatible with any other DS model.
Unlike previous models, the handheld has two VGA (0.3-megapixel) digital cameras. The first is on the internal hinge and points toward the user; the second is on the outer casing and faces away from the user. The SD card slot is also new, set behind a cover on the right side. While the DS Lite used a switch, the DSi, like the original Nintendo DS, features a button to power on or off. The button has extra functions and unlike the original's power button, it is located on the bottom-left side of the touchscreen. Brightness and volume controls are on the left side; five brightness settings—one more than on the DS Lite—are available. The headset port is on the bottom.
The DSi has a matte surface to hide fingerprints. It is available in numerous colors, but color selection varies by region. For example, lime green is exclusive to Japan, while red is available in Europe and North America. North America also received a different shade of blue. Numerous special-edition models and bundles have been released, including those for ', ', and the 2009 Black Friday shopping day.
Technical specifications.
The DSi has more RAM and a faster CPU than the DS Lite. Developers reported the console has a native mode, which runs software specifically designed for its hardware, access to the system's extra processing and memory resources. The inclusion of a codec integrated circuit (a microchip) amplifies sound signals and converts them from digital to analog. This increases audio output, and depending on the mode, higher audio quality. Unused space on the motherboard was removed; the CPU was relocated, and the battery housing was expanded.
The camera's resolution is two-and-a-half times higher than the handheld's screens. However, their resolution is considerably lower than contemporaneous digital cameras and mobile phones. This was done to help keep their price reasonable and to maintain a preferable response time for viewing photos in quick session, particularity since numerous applications will use them.
Larger model.
The Nintendo DSi XL features larger screens, and a greater overall size, than the original DSi. It is the fourth DS model, the first to be available as a pure size variation. Iwata said that cost restraints had, until then, limited the screen size and multiplayer aspects of portable game consoles, and that the DSi XL offers "an improved view angle on the screens", which makes it the first "portable system that can be enjoyed with people surrounding the gamer." He argued that this introduces a new method of playing portable video games, wherein those "surrounding the game player can also join in one way or the other to the gameplay." While the original DSi was specifically designed for individual use, Iwata suggested that DSi XL buyers give the console a "steady place on a table in the living room," so that it might be shared by multiple household members.
The DSi XL is the longest, widest and heaviest DS model. The console features two wide-viewing-angle LCD screens with the same resolution as the smaller model. It has improved battery life over the DSi on all brightness settings; for example, batteries last 13–17 hours at the dimmest setting. The handheld is outfitted with identical speakers contained in larger speaker enclosures, enabling them to produce louder sound. The hinges stop the screen at 120° in addition to the original DSi's position of 155° to allow easier table-top viewing. The DSi XL is bundled with two longer styli, one of which is thicker, rounded, and pen-like, and does not fit inside the unit.
The DSi XL has a matte surface, and the exterior of its top panel is coated with a gloss finish. It is available in eight two-toned colors, varying by region. White is exclusive to Japan, while green is available Japan and Europe. Red is exclusive to Australia and New Zealand, while yellow is available there as well as Japan and Europe. Pink is exclusive to North America. Two special-edition models were released: those for "LovePlus+" and the 25th anniversary of "Super Mario Bros." Flipnote Studio and the Nintendo DSi Browser come pre-installed with the DSi XL, alongside other, region-specific software.
Features.
Like the Wii, the DSi has upgradeable firmware, and features a menu interface that displays applications as selectable icons. The seven primary icons represent "Card Software", "Nintendo DSi Camera", "Nintendo DSi Sound", "Nintendo DSi Shop", "DS Download Play", "PictoChat", and "system settings"; additional applications may be downloaded from the DSi Shop. Icons are set in a grid navigable with the stylus or D-pad, and may be re-arranged via drag-and-drop. The power button can either soft reset the console, returning it to the main menu, or shut it down. Game cards may be hot swapped when the console is set to the main menu, allowing players to switch game cards without shutting down.
The DSi has more extensive multimedia features than previous models; AAC audio files from other devices, pictures, and downloadable software can be stored to an SD card. The latter two do not need external storage and can be stored internally. Before taking a photograph, users may modify the viewfinder's live image with ten "lens" options. Images captured can be uploaded to the Wii's Photo Channel, and, for consoles with the 1.4 firmware update or greater, to the social networking website Facebook.
The built-in sound player has voice recording and music playback functionality. Voice recordings can be edited with audio filters and manipulated through pitch and playback. Users may save and modify up to 18 ten-second sound clips. These clips cannot be exported to an SD card. Users can play music from SD cards with visualizations displayed on the upper screen. AAC audio with .mp4, .m4a, or .3GP filename extensions are supported, but non-AAC formats, including MP3, are not supported. Sounds like drum beats and the classic "Mario" jumping noises can be added with button presses. Playing music also has its own set of manipulation options similar to those used for voice recordings, as well as a group of audio filters. Using headphones, music can be played when the case is closed. Users may export photos, sounds, and Internet settings to a 3DS.
Internet connectivity.
The Nintendo DSi connects to the Internet via either its built-in 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector; both methods grant access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The DSi supports WEP, WPA (AES/TKIP), and WPA2 (AES/TKIP) wireless encryption; only software with built-in support can use the latter two encryption types, as they were not supported by the DS and DS Lite. Up to six wireless Internet connection profiles can be saved; using the traditional setup method, the first three profiles support WEP encryption, while the remaining three are selectable under a more advanced option, which supports WPA encryption. Under this advanced option, users may access the Wi-Fi Protected Setup method and configure proxy settings. The DSi can automatically detect Nintendo Zone service areas thus preventing the need to manually setup Wi-Fi connections. The service offers demos of upcoming and currently available games, access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and DSi Shop, and may have location-specific content. 
Software library.
All DS games are compatible with the DSi, except those that require the GBA slot. Because of its absence, the DSi is not backward compatible with GBA Game Paks or with accessories that require the GBA slot, such as the Nintendo DS Rumble Pak and the guitar grip. "DSi-enhanced" game cards contain DSi-exclusive features, but can still be used with earlier models; "DSi-exclusive" game cards cannot. The DSi is Nintendo's first region-locked handheld; it prevents using certain software released for another region. Due to regional differences in Internet services and parental controls, DSi-specific software is region locked. Cartridge software compatible with previous models, Internet browsing, and photo sharing are not locked. Homebrew flash cards designed for previous DS models are incompatible with the DSi, but new cards capable of running DS software on a DSi were available.
Like the Wii, the DSi can connect to an online store. The store, called the DSi Shop, allows users to download DSiWare games and applications, which are paid for with a Nintendo Points Prepaid Card (previously known as Wii Points Prepaid Card). Application prices follow a three-tiered pricing scheme. The service launched with the DSi Browser, a free web browser developed by Opera Software and Nintendo. A DSiWare trial campaign, whose expiration date varied by region, formerly offered 1,000 free Nintendo Points to each DSi that accesses the DSi Shop. As of June 2011, over 350 downloadable games were available, varying by region. Purchased DSiWare on DSi or DSi XL consoles cannot be transferred between units unless that console is repaired or replaced by Nintendo. Most DSiWare can be transferred to a 3DS, however saved data cannot.
Reception.
The Nintendo DSi received generally positive reviews. Critics praised many of the console's changes to the DS Lite's aesthetic and functionality, but complained that it launched with insufficient exclusive software. IGN's Craig Harris noted that the DSi-exclusive software library and DSi Shop were lacking in content even after five months on the Japanese market. Jeff Bakalar of CNET said that owners of the original DS should consider buying a DSi, but that its only incentive for DS Lite owners was the DSi Shop. "PCWorld" New Zealand's Jan Birkeland shared Bakalar's opinion, but believed that it was too early to judge the quality of DSi Shop software. Many critics were disappointed by the removal of the GBA cartridge slot, but some of them, such as "PCWorld"s Darren Gladstone, "Bit-tech"s Joe Martin, and IGN's Harris and Lowe, believed that it was a reasonable exchange for SD card support and the DSi Shop. However, Bakalar stated, "We'd gladly give up the 4 millimeters reduced thickness to be able to play any Game Boy Advance game."
Most reviewers criticized the quality of its cameras, particularly due to their resolution in comparison to contemporaneous mobile phones. They considered them sufficient for the DSi's screens, however. Harris and Lowe believed that the camera's only use was to take "silly pictures of yourself and others". They complained about the difficulty of taking photographs in low-light environments, and said that low-light images were tinged green or blue. Opinions on the DSi's photograph-editing tools were varied: "Bit-tech"s Martin and Reid considered them to be a gimmick, but Bakalar and Cliff Edwards of "BusinessWeek" thought otherwise. Edwards said that the camera's use in gameplay was a new opportunity for developers; Martin did not think that the concept would be widely adopted, as he believed it to be "a gimmick that would alienate [...] DS Lite owners". Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell speculated that the DSi follows Game & Watch and Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi's philosophy of using dated technology developers are familiar with to introduce new game design concepts that are inexpensive enough for mass production at a profit. He argued its features are designed to "briefly entertain" early adopters while encouraging "developers to consider it as an alternative the DS Lite" to build an attractive game library for the long term.
Because of the DSi's additions to the DS Lite design, critics recommended the console to those who had not purchased a previous DS model. Pete Metzger of the "Los Angeles Times" considered the DSi to be "more like version 2.5 than a total reboot", but called its new features "worthwhile additions to an already great product." Gladstone gave the DSi a score of 75/100, and said that Nintendo "puts in smart nips and tucks to its already-svelte handheld while adding a raft of useful multimedia features." Harris and Lowe defined the console's hardware redesign as "evolutionary", rather than "revolutionary". After the DSi was unveiled, Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew J. Fassler called the DSi Shop a "tangible early threat" to big-box stores and retailers. Martin believed that the cameras and DSi Shop did not justify purchasing the DSi at launch, but, in line with the general consensus, saw potential in future software for the console.
Douglas Rankine of "Wired UK" and McKinley Noble of "GamePro" thought previously existing Nintendo DS games were revitalized with the Nintendo DSi XL's larger screens; games like "Scribblenauts" and "The World Ends with You" benefited from increased touchscreen precision and increased legibility of text, respectively. CVG's Mike Jackson argued that the bigger screens, which made its unchanged resolution blockier, would probably be less noticeable to the older demographic for which the XL is undoubtedly designed. However, Jackson and IGN's Scott Lowe and Chris Burke agreed its clear and vivid colors considerably compensated for its unchanged resolution. Carol Mangis of "PC Magazine" thought families looking to share a handheld between members should consider a DSi XL, but the larger screens were not enough of an incentive for current DSi owners to upgrade. Lowe, Burke, Jackson, and Bakalar concluded the larger DSi model is not an essential upgrade; Jackson explained "if you tend not to carry it out with you, and only ever tend to use it at home, then the DSi XL is the better choice".

A Humpty Dumpty Thing is the title of the 2007 solo album by Jim Bob, formerly of Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine. It was released on Cherry Red Records and included a free book. "The story is set in the not too distant future when all art is commissioned by the State. It's about a man chosen to write an 80,000-word novel or face a jail term. He's never written anything before and finds himself with instant writers’ block."

Cauchy elastic material

In physics, a Cauchy-elastic material is one in which the stress at each point is determined only by the current state of deformation with respect to an arbitrary reference configuration. A Cauchy elastic material is also called a simple elastic material.
It follows from this definition that the stress in a Cauchy-elastic material does not depend on the path of deformation or the history of deformation, or on the time taken to achieve that deformation or the rate at which the state of deformation is reached. The definition also implies that the constitutive equations are spatially local; that is, the stress is only affected by the state of deformation in an infinitesimal neighborhood of the point in question, without regard for the deformation or motion of the rest of the material. It also implies that body forces (such as gravity), and inertial forces cannot affect the properties of the material. Finally, a Cauchy elastic material must satisfy the requirements of material objectivity.
Cauchy-elastic materials are mathematical abstractions, and no real material fits this definition perfectly. However, many elastic materials of practical interest, such as steel, plastic, wood and concrete, can often be assumed to be Cauchy-elastic for the purposes of stress analysis.
Mathematical definition.
Formally, a material is said to be Cauchy-elastic if the Cauchy stress tensor formula_1 is a function of the strain tensor (deformation gradient) formula_2 alone:
This definition assumes that the effect of temperature can be ignored, and the body is homogeneous. This is the constitutive equation for a Cauchy-elastic material.
Note that the function formula_4 depends on the choice of reference configuration. Typically, the reference configuration is taken as the relaxed (zero-stress) configuration, but need not be.
Frame indifference requires that the constitutive relation formula_4 should not change when the location of the observer changes. Therefore the constitutive equation for another arbitrary observer can be written formula_6. Knowing that the Cauchy stress tensor formula_7 and the deformation gradient formula_8 are objective quantities, one can write:
where formula_10 is a proper orthogonal tensor.
The above is a condition that the constitutive law formula_11 has to respect to make sure that the response of the material will be independent of the observer. Similar conditions can be derived for constitutive laws relating the deformation gradient to the first or second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor.
Isotropic Cauchy-elastic materials.
For an isotropic material the Cauchy stress tensor formula_1 can be expressed as a function of the left Cauchy-Green tensor formula_13. The constitutive equation may then be written:
In order to find the restriction on formula_15 which will ensure the principle of material frame-indifference, one can write:
A constitutive equation that respects the above condition is said to be isotropic.
Non-conservative.
Even though the stress in a Cauchy-elastic material depends only on the state of deformation, the work done by stresses may depend on the path of deformation. Therefore a Cauchy elastic material has a non-conservative structure, and the stress cannot be derived from a scalar "elastic potential" function. Materials that are conservative in this sense are called hyperelastic or "Green-elastic".

Cassina Gambrel Was Missing

Cassina Gambrel Was Missing is a 1999 novel by William Watkins. Set against turbulent events in Memphis, Tennessee in the late 1970s, the novel concerns a young, white, college student named Jackson Taylor who befriends an older black woman named Cassina Gambrel. As the protagonist's fortune and world expands, Cassina's narrows. Years later, Jackson begins a search for his former friend and the book takes on a cynical tone, bordering on bitterness, while the story unfolds through a series of revealing flashbacks. The novel has been described as part coming-of-age story and part comedy of manners and garnered praise for the author's ability to draw keen characterizations with few words and to juggle a non-linear narrative with skill.
