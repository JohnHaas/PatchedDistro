Estranged (band)

Estranged is a Malaysian alternative rock band that formed in Damansara, Kuala Lumpur in 2001. Currently comprising vocalist Rich Gimbang, lead guitarist Nor "Enha" Hanafi, rhythm guitarist Din Hormatov and drummer Azwin Andy, the band have released two full-length albums: "In Hating Memory" (2004) and "Remain Unknown" (2008).
History.
The band held their first live show in 2001, at TwelveSI. The band went through many changes to its line-up, including original lead guitarist Adzrai departing to further his studies, replaced by Hanafi, a grunge-influenced guitarist. Estranged participated in the "Yamaha Asian Beat Competition" in 2001, finishing 2nd runner-up.
After Rock The World 4 (Malaysia's annual rock festival), the band started work on their debut 11-track album 'In Hating Memory', released in December 2004. The album includes 10 English tracks and 1 Malay track. Their first single 'Velocity' started receiving airplay in June 2005, followed by the second single 'Chocolate Syrup'. Both singles were accompanied by music videos, directed by "Motion Notion" and Tan Chee Meng, respectively.
The band played alongside The All-American Rejects, Hoobastank, Raygun, Boys Like Girls, Pixie Lott, Misha Omar, and Kasabian as one of the live acts at Asia's very first MTV World Stage Live In Malaysia concert that was held in Malaysia on 15 August 2009.
Reviews.
"With a bit more diversity in the music arrangement, providing more variety between tracks, Estranged could well be an undiscovered Malaysian gem."
-TERRINA HUSSEIN, The Malay Mail, 15 June 2005
"Estranged's approach may seem middle ground, but there's still plenty of anger, as evident with plenty songs on 'In Hating Memory' being about times."
-ADLIN ROSLI, New Sunday Times, 26 June 2005

Bridget Mary McCormack

Bridget Mary McCormack is a Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court since January 1, 2013. Prior to her election, she was a professor at the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor. She taught criminal law and legal ethics and oversaw the law school's clinical programs as associate dean of clinical affairs. Her academic work focused on practical experience in legal education.
She launched and worked in a pediatric advocacy law clinic focusing on children with health problems, and a domestic violence clinic. Additionally, she is founder of the Michigan Innocence Clinic, the first innocence clinic in the country that exclusively handles non-DNA evidence cases.
In November 2012, she was elected a justice of the Michigan Supreme Court, to replace Marilyn Kelly, who was retiring from the bench. McCormack resigned from her position at the university before joining the Court. McCormack is considered a liberal. Her campaign for Supreme Court was endorsed by the Michigan Democratic Party, although in Michigan state Supreme Court elections appear on the nonpartisan section of the ballot.
Education and background.
McCormack went to high school in central New Jersey. She received her B.A. with honors in political science and philosophy from Trinity College in Connecticut in 1988. She received her J.D. from New York University School of Law, where she was a Root-Tilden Scholar, in 1991.
McCormack started her legal career in New York, first as trial counsel at the Legal Aid Society and then at the Office of the Appellate Defender. She taught at Yale Law School in New Haven, Connecticut as a Robert M. Cover Fellow from 1997-98. She joined the faculty of the University of Michigan Law School in 1998, and has served as its associate dean of clinical affairs since 2003.
Professional activities.
As associate dean for clinical affairs at the law school, McCormack supervises students in complex federal litigation in the general clinical program. McCormack has also worked to expand Michigan Law School's clinical offerings during her tenure.
In 2008, McCormack founded the Michigan Innocence Clinic, which is the nation's first exclusively non-DNA innocence clinic. As of September 22, 2012, the Michigan Innocence Clinic has exonerated five innocent people who were wrongfully convicted.
McCormack has published articles on constitutional law, criminal law, criminal procedure, evidence, and legal ethics. McCormack also serves on the Association of American Law Schools Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure. In 2008, she testified before the Detroit City Council about its investigation of the city attorney's role in the case involving former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.
Michigan Supreme Court.
In 2012, McCormack won election to the Michigan Supreme Court.
McCormack's campaign included a campaign ad encouraging voters to complete the non-partisan section of the ballot, where seats such as the one she was running for are listed. The campaign ad featured a reunion of much of the principal cast of "The West Wing", including McCormack's sister Mary. During the campaign, the Judicial Crisis Network released an ad claiming that McCormack had "volunteered to help free a terrorist" when she represented accused mercenary Abdumuqit Vohidov. Andrew Rosenthal of the "New York Times" criticized the ad as exploitative, pointing out that Vohidov was released by a non-judicial board (not through McCormack's efforts), and questioning whether he should be described as a "terrorist".
McCormack and incumbents Stephen Markman and Brian Zahra were elected on November 6, 2012.
Personal life.
McCormack's father is a former United States Marine and retired small business owner, and her mother is a clinical social worker. McCormack's sister Mary McCormack is an actress, known for her role as Kate Harper in the NBC series "The West Wing", as well as Howard Stern's wife in "Private Parts" and her lead role as Mary Shannon on USA Network's "In Plain Sight". Her brother, Will McCormack, is an actor and screenwriter.
McCormack is married to University of Michigan Law School professor Steven P. Croley, currently on leave serving in the Obama Administration as a deputy White House counsel. The couple has four children.

Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of Australia

Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of Australia are surveys conducted to construct rankings of the success and popularity of the individuals who have served as Prime Minister of Australia.
"The Age" ranking.
John Curtin has been regarded as Australia's greatest Prime Minister in a survey by "The Age", followed by Sir Robert Menzies and then Bob Hawke. The lowest ranked Prime Minister was William McMahon.
Only Prime Ministers since 1939 were considered for listing, with three caretaker Prime Ministers (Arthur Fadden, Frank Forde, and John McEwen) excluded.
This study was conducted prior to the electoral defeat of the Howard Government and, as such, it does not take into account opinions of decision made by Howard towards the end of his premiership, and also did not consider Kevin Rudd or Julia Gillard nor their Labor Governments' ministries, which were elected after the poll.
Rankings by highest approval rating.
It is possible to compare the highest approval ratings achieved by Prime Ministers in various opinion polls.
Nielsen Poll.
According to the Nielsen Poll (available since 1972), Bob Hawke had the highest approval rating in November 1984, with 75%, and the lowest was William McMahon, with a 34% approval rating.
Highest Nielsen Poll ratings for each Prime Minister since 1972:
William McMahon ended 1971 with an approval rating of 36.4%. By the end of 1972, his popularity had sunk to 34%, and he was defeated by Gough Whitlam in the 1972 election.
Newspoll.
According to Newspoll (available since 1987), Kevin Rudd had the highest approval rating of 73%, while Paul Keating had the lowest approval rating in the period 20–22 August 1993, at only 17%.
JWS research.
John Scales, of JWS research, in May 2011 polled 2141 people in the 10 most marginal Labor seats and the 10 most marginal Coalition seats.
Asked "which, of the past five, had been the best government for Australia ?", responses were as follows:
In all, 50 per cent of all respondents nominated a Liberal Party government, with 42 per cent nominating the Labor Party. At the time of the survey, the federal government was led by the Labor Party.

AS4

AS4 is a Conformance Profile of the OASIS ebMS 3.0 specification, and represents an open standard for the secure and payload-agnostic exchange of Business-to-business documents using Web services. Secure document exchange is governed by aspects of WS-Security, including XML Encryption and XML Digital Signatures. Payload agnosticism refers to the document type (e.g. purchase order, invoice, etc.) not being tied to any defined SOAP action or operation.
The draft AS4 profile has recently been accepted by the OASIS ebXML Messaging Services Technical Committee and has been submitted to OASIS for public review. The majority of the AS4 profiling points constraining the ebMS 3.0 specification are based upon the functional requirements of the AS2 specification. By scaling back ebMS 3.0 by using AS2 as a blueprint, AS4 provides an entry-level on-ramp for Web services B2B by simplifying the complexities of Web services.

Hisss

Hisss (also known as Nagin: The Snake Woman) is a 2010 film, directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat plays the lead role as Nagin.
Plot.
George States (Jeff Doucette) is suffering from the last stage of brain cancer and has only six months to live. In order to prevent death and gain immortality, he decides to extract the 'Nagmani' from a shape-shifting snake who can take human form, Nagin (Mallika Sherawat). He captures the nag male snake so that the nagin female comes after the capturer to free her lover, thus allowing him to obtain the nagmani by force. He keeps the nag in a glass box where he electrocutes and tortures him. His plan works and the nagin starts following him. On her way, she is helped by a police inspector (Irrfan Khan) and his wife (Divya Dutta), who is infertile, causing a strain in their relationship. The nagin also helps a few women who are helpless: One who is beaten mercilessly by her husband; one being raped by a man and so on. She brutally murders those men who were involved in the capture of her mate as well as men who torture women. The police inspector who is trying to help her find her mate investigates the murders. Finally, she reaches George's hideout where she reclaims her mate and they engage both in sexual intimacy. George attempts to capture the nagin during intercourse since this will be when she will be at her most vulnerable. Wearing a suit that hides his heat signature, he lures her by using her dying mate as bait to a trap. He captures her and tries taking the nagmani but at that moment, the police inspector arrives and helps her. Angered by the death of her mate by the hands of George, she takes on a huge form: half snake, half woman, and throws him in the same glass box where her mate was kept and electrocutes him.
Production.
The film was shot simultaneously in English and Hindi. Famed special effects designer Robert Kurtzman was responsible for developing the look of the Snake Woman in the film.

Premiere.
The film was set to premiere at the Montreal Festival du Nouveau Cinéma on October 14 and at the Gotham Screen Film Festival & Screenplay Contest in New York on October 15 but was pulled from both festivals shortly before they opened.
Reception.
Hisss attracted negative reviews from various critics. Nikhat Kazmi of "Times of India" gave it 2 out of 5 stars and stated - "A film like Hisss should have scored with its special effects. But once again, the carnage that the serpent unleashes is grotesque and her transformation from seductress woman to venomous reptile is more funny than eyeball-grabbing."
Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave it 1/2 star out of five & stated that " If there were Razzies in Bollywood, HISSS would win hands down. Films like HISSS make you realize what's going wrong in Bollywood today. On one hand we celebrate the new stories being told in our movies and on the other, we churn out a HISSS, which is badly scripted, poorly enacted and carelessly directed. Believe me, it's easy to solve the crossword puzzle in newspapers than it is to understand what exactly is going on in this film.As for director Jennifer Lynch, she needs a crash course in film-making pronto. The visual effects seem straight out of a B-grade Bollywood film.On the whole, HISSS is best avoided. "
Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN gave it 1 star out of five & stated that "In Hisss, directed by Jennifer Lynch, Mallika stars as a shape-shifting snake that’s been separated from her reptile lover by a crazy foreigner who’s seeking a naagmani that will cure his cancer. The outrageous plot involves this ichchadhari nagin emerging as something of a feminist superhero who comes to the rescue of various tormented women, even as she’s seeking out her kidnapped partner. Irrfan Khan plays the cop investigating a series of mysterious killings, and Divya Dutta his wife.At 90 minutes it’s mercifully short, but watch it only if you’re not easily disgusted."
Anupama Chopra from NDTV gave it 1/2 star out of five & stated that "Hisss has marginally better special effects and much more nudity but the script is so deliriously inept that, in comparison, the average Ramsay horror film looks like a class act."
Mayank Shekher from "Hindustan Times" gave it 1 star out of five & stated that "This is pornography for the hormonally demented teen. Or maybe this is erotica."
The film scores only 2 out of 10 on the reviewgang.com .
Soundtrack.
Anu Malik composed the on camera songs for the film. Alexander von Bubenheim composed the original score. The soundtrack consists of six original recordings, composed by Anu Malik, David Kushner, Panjabi MC, Alexander Von Bubenheim, Salim-Sulaiman and Julian Lennon, and lyrics penned by Sameer, Shruti Haasan, Mallika Sherawat, Shweta Pandit, Shraddha Pandit and Sayeed Quadri.

Pandemic (South Park)

"Pandemic" is the tenth episode of the twelfth season of the American animated television series "South Park", and the 177th episode of the series overall. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 22, 2008.
It is the first of a two-part episode. In the episode, the boys try to capitalize on a sudden rise in Peruvian flute bands, unwittingly becoming players in a demonic being's plan to employ giant guinea pigs to attack the public. The storyline of this episode concludes in the next episode, "".
The episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States.
Plot.
Seeing all the Peruvian pan flute bands that have become popular recently, and the money they can make daily by selling CDs, Stan convinces Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny to start their own pan flute band. They convince their classmate Craig to invest his $100 birthday money as venture capital. The plan backfires when the head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security cracks down on all Peruvian flute bands, rounding them up and imprisoning them in Miami, with the boys also arrested in the process. While imprisoned, Craig continually criticises Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny, saying that the four main protagonists' constant schemes and their subsequent failures are the main reason for their unpopularity. The boys attempt to convince their captors that they are American citizens, but the DHS only agrees to release the boys if they agree to go on a mission to overthrow the country of Peru, in order to stop the pandemic of Peruvian flute bands at its source. As the boys prepare for their mission, Peruvian musicians still interned in the camp warn guards that their captivity will unleash the "Furry Death".
Meanwhile, Stan's father, Randy Marsh, rouses the ire of his family by videotaping every mundane household activity with his new camcorder. As he records even more useless footage, there is a strange noise outside, and when he goes outside, we see the city is under attack by unknown beasts (later revealed to be large guinea pigs). As Randy runs from the attackers, he falls. The episode then cuts to the Head of Homeland Security, who reveals that unleashing the guinea pigs was his plan all along, and that the only person who can stop them is Craig, who is too far away to stop them.
Cultural references.
The monsters and shaky camera style of cinematography are a reference to the 2008 American monster movie "Cloverfield".
Reception.
The episode received mixed reviews. IGN rated the episode a 6.2/10, stating "the show falls back on its old gimmicks of a national crisis with fast-paced scenes of men talking importantly about stupid things. The show is good at this stuff, but we've seen it all before and it seems out of place and meaningless here. It's a long walk for a joke that's only somewhat amusing, and never hilarious".

That's Why

"That's Why" is the fifth studio album released by American country music artist Craig Morgan. It was released on October 21, 2008 as his first album for BNA Records (see 2008 in country music) after his exiting Broken Bow Records earlier that same year. As with his first two Broken Bow albums — 2003's "I Love It" and 2005's "My Kind of Livin"' — Morgan co-produced the album with Phil O'Donnell. They co-wrote the lead-off single "Love Remembers", which became Morgan's sixth Top Ten hit on the Hot Country Songs charts in November 2008. Following this song was "God Must Really Love Me", which became his first single to miss the Top 20 since "Look At Us", which peaked at number 27 in 2004. A May 21, 2009 reissue added two new songs, including "Bonfire," which was released that month as the third single. As of September 18, 2010, the album has sold 60,868 copies in the U.S.
Content.
"Love Remembers".
As with his previous albums on the Broken Bow Records label, Morgan wrote several songs on "That's Why" with his producer, Phil O'Donnell. One of their co-writes, "Love Remembers", was the first single release from the album, and was shipped to radio in mid-2008. It became Morgan's sixth Top Ten hit in December 2008, peaking at number 9 on "Billboard" Hot Country Songs.
"God Must Really Love Me".
The album's second single was "God Must Really Love Me", written by Troy Verges and Jim Collins. This song is also a mid-tempo ballad, where the narrator states that he must be loved by God, because he has all that he wants in his life. "God Must Really Love Me" reached a peak of number 26 on the country singles charts in May 2009.
Leeann Ward of Country Universe gave this song a C- rating, saying that its production was "cheesy" and overdone, and that its melody was largely predictable. She also said that its message was "generic, yet irresponsible", adding, "With such logic, the reason why others aren't still alive is because God must not have really loved them?"
"Bonfire".
On May 26, 2009, "That's Why" was re-issued with the new tracks "Bonfire" and "This Ain't Nothin'," which replaced "Every Red Light" and "Summer Sundown." Morgan wrote "Bonfire" with former Lyric Street Records artist Kevin Denney, as well as Mike Rogers and Tom Botkin. Released in May as the third single, it debuted at number 55 on the chart week of June 6, 2009. The song would go on to become Morgan's third top 5 hit, peaking at number 4.
"This Ain't Nothin'".
"This Ain't Nothin'" is the album's fourth single. This song was written by Chris DuBois and Kerry Kurt Phillips, and was released to radio on January 25, 2010.
Reception.
Stephen Thomas Erlewine, reviewing the album for Allmusic, gave it three stars out of five. He said that the production and lyrics were largely uninspired, and that most of the songs were mid-tempo in nature, but added that Morgan's "cured country croon" kept the material from sounding too much like pop music. Jessica Phillips of "Country Standard Time" gave a more favorable review. Although she said that his lyrics tended towards commonplace country topics such as "patriotism, family, southern pride, faith, and love," she said that the songs were "simple but profoundly observant" and that Morgan's voice recalled Randy Travis. Phillips cited "Lookin' Back with You" as one of the strongest lyrics that Morgan had written, and noted his "almost-power ballad" performance on "Love Remembers." "USA Today" gave the album two and a half stars and wrote, "Everyday life makes for tricky subject matter -- the best songs come alive when he gets the details just right; otherwise, they just rhyme."

Errol Scorcher

Errol Scorcher (born Errol Archer, 1956 – January 19, 2012) was a Jamaican reggae deejay.
Biography.
Scorcher worked as a deejay on several sound systems from the early 1970s. Although his first single, "Leggo Mi Hand Babylon" was not a commercial success, he had several hits in the mid-1970s with tracks such as "Jolly Bus-Ting" and "Engineers Affair". In 1978 his profile was raised further by his "Peace Truce" single, which celebrated the armistice between rival political factions that would culminate in the "One Love Peace Concert". The same year, Scorcher joined Nicodemus, Nigger Kojak, and Mother Liza on Prince Jammy's "Tapetone" sound system, which soon became Jamaica's top system. His first album, "Rasta Fire", was also released on the United Artists offshoot Ballistic, on which he was backed by The Revolutionaries. In 1979 he had a hit with "Roach in a De Corner" (on the "Real Rock" rhythm), which was followed by the similar "Frog In a Water" (on the "My Conversation" rhythm), both songs appearing on his 1980 album "Roach In A De Corner". He worked with Ansell Collins on a series off recordings including "Mosquitoes", which was also a hit. He also set up his own "Scorcher" label and began production work on both his own recordings and for artists such as Tony Tuff.

<doc id="19855548" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19855548" title="Tremellaceae">
Tremellaceae

The Tremellaceae are a family of fungi in the order Tremellales. The family is cosmopolitan and contains both teleomorphic and anamorphic genera, most of the latter being yeasts. All teleomorphic species of fungi in the Tremellaceae are parasites of other fungi, though the yeast states are widespread and not restricted to hosts. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies), when produced, are gelatinous. 
The family currently comprises 18 genera (plus synonyms), containing around 250 valid species. Significant genera include "Tremella", two species of which are edible and commercially cultivated, and the yeast genus "Cryptococcus", several species of which are human pathogens, causing cryptococcosis.
History.
Fries created the family Tremellaceae (as 'Tremellini') in 1821, basing it on the macromorphology of fruit bodies. He included within it most species of fungi that were gelatinous, dividing it into the genera "Agyrium", "Dacrymyces", "Exidia", "Hymenella", "Naematelia", and "Tremella". "Agyrium" and "Hymenella" are now referred to the Ascomycota, as are several of the species Fries placed in "Dacrymyces" and "Tremella".
In 1900 Patouillard radically revised the family by switching the emphasis to the micromorphology of fruit bodies. For Patouillard, the Tremellaceae was limited to genera and species in which the basidia were "tremelloid" (globose to ellipsoid with vertical or diagonal septa), whether or not the fruit bodies were gelatinous. Patouillard's revised Tremellaceae included the genera "Clavariopsis" (= "Holtermannia"), "Ditangium", "Exidia", "Guepinia", "Heterochaete", "Hyaloria", "Protomerulius", "Sebacina", "Sirobasidium", "Tremella", and "Tremellodon" (= "Pseudohydnum").
The next major revision was in 1984, when Bandoni used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the ultrastructure of the septal pore apparatus in species of the Tremellaceae. This revealed that "Tremella" and its allies were distinct from "Exidia" and its allies, despite both groups having tremelloid basidia. Bandoni referred the latter group to the Auriculariaceae, restricting the Tremellaceae to the genera "Holtermannia", "Tremella", and "Trimorphomyces". The genus "Sirobasidium" and its allies were placed in the Sirobasidiaceae.
Current status.
Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, confirms Bandoni's split between the tremelloid and exidioid fungi and extends the circumscription of the tremelloid group by including several yeast genera whose status was formerly uncertain. Molecular research has also indicated that the genus "Filobasidiella" (and its yeast state "Cryptococcus") should be included within the group, even though its basidia are not tremelloid. The research does not, however, support a distinct family Tremellaceae within the order Tremellales, but instead divides the order (and indeed the genus "Tremella") into several small clades. As currently circumscribed, the Tremellaceae is therefore an artificial subset of the Tremellales, not clearly distinct from the Sirobasidiaceae.
Description of teleomorphs.
Many species of the Tremellaceae occur in the hymenium of their hosts and do not produce visible fruit bodies. When fruit bodies are produced, they are always gelatinous, and typically brightly coloured. Microscopically, all have hyphae bearing haustorial cells which produce filaments that connect to the hyphae of their host fungi. Except in the genus "Filobasidiella", the basidia are "tremelloid": globose to ellipsoid with vertical or diagonal septa, producing basidiospores on long, indeterminate sterigmata or epibasidia. Basidiospores in most (but not all) species germinate by producing germ tubes (normal for basidiomycetes) or yeast cells. Many species of the Tremellaceae also produce asexual conidiospores.
Habitat and distribution.
Teleomorphic species of the Tremellaceae are parasitic on other fungi in the phyla Ascomycota (including lichens) and Basidiomycota. They typically parasitize species that grow on dead wood of living shrubs and trees and it may be that their gelatinous fruit bodies are an adaption to such a periodically arid environment. The family is cosmopolitan in distribution, though individual species may be restricted to temperate regions or the tropics. The anamorphic yeast states are typically widespread and not restricted to host or substrate.

Rockabilly 514 is a 2008 Canadian feature documentary directed by Patricia Chica (Canada) and Mike Wafer (England). The film documents the lives of a group of people belonging to the rockabilly sub-culture in Montreal, Quebec (Canada). Some of the original 1950s rockabilly stars also appear in the documentary: Wanda Jackson (the first lady of rockabilly); The Comets (Bill Haley's original band) and Joe Clay.
The film has been presented at numerous film and music festivals including Pop Montreal (Montreal, Canada), Viva Las Vegas (Las Vegas, United States), Gimme Shelter Music and Film Festival (Athens, Greece) and Don't Knock The Rock Film and Music Festival (Los Angeles, United States). On October 18, 2009 the film won two awards at the Director's Chair Film Festival in New York; the Best Documentary Award and the Best Original Soundtrack award. It was also a finalist in the Best Sound and Best Editing categories.
The film was commercially released at Cinéma du Parc in Montreal, Quebec on October 6, 2008.
Cast members of the film include Bloodshot Bill, The Cockroaches, Nathalie Lavergne, Mademoiselle Oui Oui Encore, Mister Blue Eyes, Guillaume Ozoux and Sonya Topolnisky. It was narrated by ethnomusicologist Craig Morrison (Go Cat Go! Rockabilly Music and Its Makers).
In The Gazette of September 27, 2008, film critic John Griffin wrote: "Québécois' take on rockabilly makes for an interesting toe-tapping documentary".

Chemical force microscopy

Chemical force microscopy (CFM) is a variation of atomic force microscopy (AFM) which has become a versatile tool for characterization of materials surfaces. With AFM, structural morphology is probed using simple tapping or contact modes that utilize van der Waals interactions between tip and sample to maintain a constant probe deflection amplitude (constant force mode) or maintain height while measuring tip deflection (constant height mode). CFM, on the other hand, uses chemical interactions between functionalized probe tip and sample. Choice chemistry is typically gold-coated tip and surface with R-SH thiols attached, R being the functional groups of interest. CFM enables the ability to determine the chemical nature of surfaces, irrespective of their specific morphology, and facilitates studies of basic chemical bonding enthalpy and surface energy. Typically, CFM is limited by thermal vibrations within the cantilever holding the probe. This limits force measurement resolution to ~1 pN which is still very suitable considering weak COOH/CH3 interactions are ~20 pN per pair. Hydrophobicity is used as the primary example throughout this consideration of CFM, but certainly any type of bonding can be probed with this method.
Pioneering work.
CFM has been primarily developed by Charles Lieber at Harvard University in 1994. The method was demonstrated using hydrophobicity where polar molecules (e.g. COOH) tend to have the strongest binding to each other, followed by nonpolar (e.g. CH3-CH3) bonding, and a combination being the weakest. Probe tips are functionalized and substrates patterned with these molecules. All combinations of functionalization were tested, both by tip contact and removal as well as spatial mapping of substrates patterned with both moieties and observing the complementarity in image contrast. Both of these methods are discussed below. The AFM instrument used is similar to the one in Figure 1.
Force of adhesion (tensile testing).
This is the simpler mode of CFM operation where a functionalized tip is brought in contact with the surface and is pulled to observe the force at which separation occurs, Fad (see Figure 2). The Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) theory of adhesion mechanics predicts this value as 
(1) formula_1
where WSMT = γSM+γTM-γST with R being the radius of the tip, and γ being various surface energies between the tip, sample, and the medium each is in (liquids discussed below). R is usually obtained from SEM and γSM and γTM from contact angle measurements on substrates with the given moieties. When the same functional groups are used, γSM = γTM and γST = 0 which results in Fad = 3πRγSM, TM. Doing this twice with two different moieties (e.g. COOH and CH3) gives values of γSM and γTM, both of which can be used together in the same experiment to determine γST. Therefore, Fad can be calculated for any combination of functionalities for comparison to CFM determined values.
For similarly functionalized tip and surface, at tip detachment JKR theory also predicts a contact radius of
(2) formula_2
with an “effective” Young's modulus of the tip K=(2/3)(E/(1-ν2)) derived from the actual value E and the Poisson ratio ν. If one knows the effective area of a single functional group, AFG (e.g. from quantum chemistry simulations), the total number of ligands participating in tension can be estimated as formula_3. As stated earlier, the force resolution of CFM does allow one to probe individual bonds of even the weakest variety, but tip curvature typically prevents this. Using Eq 2, a radius of curvature R<10 nm has been determined as the requirement to conduct tensile testing of individual linear moieties.
A quick note to mention is the work corresponding to the hysteresis in the force profile (Figure 2) does not correlate to the bond energy. The work done in retracting the tip is formula_4, approximated due to the linear behavior of deformation with Fmax being the force and Δx being the displacement immediately before release. Using the results of Frisbie et al., normalized to the estimated 50 functional groups in contact, the work values are estimated as 39 eV, 0.25 eV, and 4.3 eV for COOH/COOH, COOH/CH3, and CH3/CH3 interactions, respectively. Roughly, intermolecular bond energies can be calculated by: Ebond=kTB, TB being the boiling point. According to this, Ebond = 32.5 meV for formic acid, HCOOH, and 9.73 meV for methane, CH4, each value being about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the experiment might suggest. Even if surface passivation with EtOH were considered (discussed below), the large error seems irrecoverable. The strongest hydrogen bonds are at most ~1 eV in energy. This strongly implies that the cantilever has a force constant smaller than or on the order of that for bond interactions and, therefore, it cannot be treated as perfectly rigid. This does open an avenue for increasing the usefulness of CFM if stiffer cantilevers can be used while still maintaining force resolution.
Frictional force mapping.
Chemical interactions can also be used to map prepatterned substrates with varying functionalities (see Figure 3). Scanning of a surface having varying hydrophobicity with a tip having no functional groups attached would produce an image with no contrast because the surface is morphologically featureless (simple AFM operation). Functionalizing a tip to be hydrophilic would cause the cantilever to bend when the tip scans across hydrophilic portions of the substrate due to strong tip-substrate interactions. This is detected by laser deflection in a position sensitive detector therefore producing a chemical profile image of the surface. Generally, a brighter area would correspond to a greater amplitude of deflection so stronger bonding corresponds to lighter areas of a CFM image map. When the cantilever functionalization is switched such that the tip is bent when encountering hydrophobic areas of the substrate instead, the complementary image is observed.
Frictional force response to the amount of perpendicular load applied by the tip on to the substrate is shown in Figure 4. Increasing tip-substrate interactions produce a steeper slope, as one would expect. Of experimental importance is the fact that contrast between different functionalities on the surface may be enhanced with an application of greater perpendicular force. Of course, this comes at the cost of potential damage to the substrate.
Ambient: measurements in liquids.
Capillary force is a major problem in tensile force measurements since it effectively strengthens the tip-surface interaction. It is usually caused by adsorbed moisture on substrates from ambient environment. To eliminate this additional force, measurements in liquids can be conducted. With X-terminated tip and substrate in liquid L, the addition to Fad is calculated using Eq 1 with WXLX = 2γLL; that is, the extra force comes from the attraction of liquid molecules to each other. This is ~10 pN for EtOH which still allows for the observation of even the weakest polar/nonpolar interactions (~20 pN). The choice of liquid is dependent on which interactions are of interest. When the solvent is immiscible with functional groups, larger than usual tip-surface bonding exists. Therefore, organic solvents are appropriate for studying van der Waals and hydrogen bonding while electrolytes are best for probing hydrophobic and electrostatic forces.
Applications in nanoscience.
A second consideration is one that takes advantage of unique nanoscale materials properties. The high aspect ratio of carbon nanotubes (easily >1000) is exploited to image surfaces with deep features.. The use of the carbon material broadens the functionalization chemistry since there are countless routes to chemical modification of nanotube sidewalls (e.g. with diazonium, simple alkyls, hydrogen, ozone/oxygen, and amines). Multiwall nanotubes are typically used for their rigidity. Because of their approximately planar ends, one can estimate the number of functional groups that are in contact with the substrate knowing tube diameter and number of walls which helps in determining single moiety tensile properties. Certainly, this method has obvious implications in tribology as well.

__NOTOC__
The Miller WM-2 was a single-seat sport aircraft designed in the United States in the early 1970s and marketed for home building. Although primarily a powered aircraft, the WM-2's high aspect-ratio wings enabled the pilot to stop the engine and soar on thermals as with a sailplane (designer W. Terry Miller's previous projects had been sailplanes). 
It was a generally conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with a cockpit enclosed by a bubble canopy. The undercarriage, however, was a manually retractable monowheel with a tailskid behind it. The fuselage was of wooden construction, covered in plywood and fibreglass, while the wings and tail were built of wood and covered in fabric.

Shimmer Championship

The Shimmer Championship is a professional wrestling championship in Shimmer Women Athletes. It is competed for in Shimmer Women Athletes, and has been defended on shows of sister promotions Ring of Honor and Full Impact Pro. Championship reigns are determined by professional wrestling matches, in which competitors are involved in scripted rivalries. These narratives create feuds between the various competitors, which cast them as villains and heroines.
History.
Shimmer was founded by Dave Prazak and Allison Danger in 2005. Since then the wrestlers fought matches for competition or personal rivalries, with no prize on the line. After nearly two years, it was decided that the time was right to create their own Championship that would have represented them all over the world. The title was created on June 2, 2007, and it was put on the line during a Two Nights Elimination Tournament in Berwyn, IL. In the finals Sara Del Rey defeated Lacey to become the first champion. She defended the title for 327 Days, including defenses at Ring of Honor shows against Lacey and Daizee Haze, and defenses in SHIMMER against Lacey, Amazing Kong, and Sarah Stock. Del Rey lost the title to MsChif who defeated her in "Volume 18" to become the new champion. MsChif has also successfully defended her title more times (6) than Del Rey (5) despite having held the title for less time. MsChif has defended the title against Jetta, Mercedes Martinez, Daizee Haze, and Ariel in Shimmer, against Rain in Full Impact Pro, and against Del Rey in ROH as part of a Pay Per View taping (this was Del Rey's 'rematch' for the title). MsChif successfully defended the title at ROH's St. Louis event on March 13 against Haze after hitting the Desecrater. On April 11, 2010, at the tapings of "Volume 31", Madison Eagles defeated MsChif to become the third Shimmer Champion. On September 3, 2011, the title was for the first time defended outside of the United States, when Eagles defeated Jessie McKay and Nicole Matthews at a "PWWA" event in Australia. On October 2, 2011, at the tapings of "Volume 44", Cheerleader Melissa defeated Eagles to become the fourth champion. On March 18, 2012, at the tapings of "Volume 48", Melissa lost the title to Saraya Knight. Melissa regained the title from Knight in a steel cage match on April 6, 2013, at the Volume 53 internet pay-per-view, becoming the first two-time Shimmer Champion.
Tournament.
The tournament was held over two nights on June 1 and June 2, 2007 at the Eagles Club in Berwyn, Illinois. The first two rounds were held on the first night, with the semis and final held on the second. The first and second rounds were filmed for release on "Volume 11", while the semi-finals and finals were filmed the next night for "Volume 12".
The tournament brackets were:
1: Sarah Stock was listed as an 'International Wildcard' entry, having never competed in Shimmer before.
2: Alicia substituted for Serena Deeb, who was unable to make it to the building in time for her match due to a car accident.

Regular moon

In astronomy, a regular moon is a natural satellite following a relatively close and prograde orbit with little orbital inclination or eccentricity. They are believed to have formed in orbit about their primary, as opposed to irregular moons, which were captured.
There are at least 55 regular satellites of the eight planets: one at Earth, eight at Jupiter, 22 named regular moons at Saturn (not counting hundreds or thousands of moonlets), 18 known at Uranus, and 6 small regular moons at Neptune. (Large Triton appears to have been captured.) It is thought that Pluto's five moons and Haumea's two were formed in orbit about those dwarf planets out of debris created in giant collisions.

Helen Thornycroft

Helen Thornycroft (1848 – 11 November 1937) was an English painter of the Victorian era.
She was a member of the well-known Thornycroft family of sculptors, which included her maternal grandfather John Francis, her father Thomas Thornycroft, her mother Mary Thornycroft, and her younger brother Hamo Thornycroft. Hamo and Helen's sisters Alyce (1844–1906) and Theresa (1853–1947) were both artists as well. Edmund Gosse was a relative by marriage. (The family had strong multiple connections with the English art world of the nineteenth century; Theresa Thornycroft and Ellen Thornycroft Gosse studied painting under Ford Madox Brown.)
Helen's brother John Isaac Thornycroft began his shipbuilding career by constructing a steam launch at home in his late teens. Helen, nicknamed "Nello," was reportedly his "only helper" in this endeavor. While helping John Isaac, she was "nearly scalped" when her hair tangled in his machinery; she wore her hair short from then on, in defiance of the reigning custom.
Helen, Hamo, Alyce, and Theresa were all trained in the Royal Academy schools starting in the 1860s, when the institution was only beginning to take female students. The date and circumstances of Helen's entry are disputed; by one account, she applied in 1862, but was rejected by Sir Edwin Landseer because of her youth (she was 14 at the time). Helen started out as a sculptor like previous generations of her family; she exhibited a statue of Ophelia in the Royal Academy summer show of 1864. Within a year or two, however, she abandoned sculpture to concentrate on painting.
Helen travelled abroad with Hamo and Alyce in 1871; the siblings studied art with and modeled for each other through the 1870s. Hamo's journals, kept during this period, provide ample evidence on the family's affairs. By Hamo's account, the young Helen enjoyed a "wonderful" supply of natural energy. His journals record an evening when the two of them walked home at 2:00 AM; Helen was up by 6:30 to go swimming, then worked at the Royal Academy schools until 2:00 PM.
"Helen was a more prolific and committed artist than her sisters" — by the late 1880s she had her own studio and her own apartment, which was again unusual for the time. She became known primarily as a flower painter, a genre long associated with women; yet she also worked in other genres, including landscape and portraiture. She spent a decade (1899–1909) as vice-president of the Society of Women Artists. She never married. Many sources mistakenly give the year of her death as 1912.

Primary (astronomy)

A primary (or gravitational primary, primary body or central body) is the main physical body of a gravitationally bound, multi-object system. This body contributes most of the mass of that system and will generally be located near its center of mass.
In the solar system, the Sun is the primary for all objects that orbit around it. In the same way, the primary of all satellites (be they natural satellites (moons) or artificial satellites) is the planet they orbit. The word primary is often used to avoid specifying whether the object near the center of mass is a planet, a star or any other astronomical object. In this sense, primary is always used as a noun.
The center of mass is the average position of all the objects weighed by mass. The Sun is so massive that the solar system's center of mass is very close to the center of the Sun. However, the gas giants are far enough from the sun that the center of mass of the solar system can be outside the Sun, despite the Sun having most of the mass of the solar system.
An interesting example of what can be called a primary is Pluto and its moon, Charon. The center of mass (or barycenter) of those two bodies is always "outside" Pluto's surface. This has led some astronomers to call the Pluto-Charon system a "binary" dwarf planet or a double planet rather than simply a dwarf planet (the primary) and its moon. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union briefly considered a formal definition of the term "double planet" that could have formally included Pluto and Charon but this definition was not ratified.
Beyond the solar system, the use of the noun primary, in reference to an exoplanet, is dubious. Astronomers have not yet detected any bodies that orbit an exoplanet. The use of primary to refer to the supermassive black holes in the center of most galaxies has not occurred in scientific journals.

The Milk and Honey Band

The Milk And Honey Band is an English rock band centred around the talents of singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Robert White (ex-Ring, Levitation and Zag And The Coloured Beads).
Sound.
The music of The Milk And Honey Band is a mixture of pastoral English psychedelic rock, accessible acoustic pop songwriting and space rock, with plentiful use of acoustic guitars and banked vocal harmonies plus extended melodic lead guitar and atmospheric production. XTC's Andy Partridge (the owner of their current record label) has described them as "a bit like The Moody Blues but with more energy and better songs. Or at times like a blissful Who.”. Various reviewers have made comparisons to Crowded House, David Gray, Elliott Smith, Ron Sexsmith, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, XTC, Teenage Fanclub, The La's and Nick Drake.
A high proportion of the band's music has been recorded alone by its leader Robert White, who is an accomplished multi-instrumentalist and producer. The band's first album was effectively a Robert White solo recording, while subsequent albums have seen the band grow to a three-piece and eventually a five-piece with varying involvement from other members.
History.
Roots in London psychedelia (early 1980s to 1993).
Robert White began his musical career in the south London free festival scene of the 1980s. Working in the psychedelic/experimental genre, he sang backing vocals and played various instruments (mostly bass guitar and keyboards) for assorted bands (most notably Zag And The Coloured Beads, Ring and "jazz punk" band Peru). Many bands in this grouping - such as the Purple People Eaters, The Dave Howard Singers and Cardiacs - interacted and shared members. Another member of Zag And The Coloured Beads was guitarist/bass player Michael Tubb – both he and Ring guitarist Christian Hayes would work with White on future projects.
In 1990, White and Hayes both joined the hotly tipped Levitation, an indie-psychedelic rock band which also featured former House Of Love guitarist Terry Bickers, bass player Joe Allen, violinist Johnny T and drummer David Francolini. White was the band’s keyboard player, third guitarist and main harmony singer: within its collective songwriting format, he also wrote a high proportion of the band’s material.
Levitation recorded three albums and several EPs, and gained a lot of press attention. Severe tensions within the band, however, ensured that it was a relatively short-lived unit. Both Johnny T and Joe Allen left after the first single (the latter was replaced by Laurence O'Keefe), and the mercurial frontman Bickers split very publically with the band in 1993, to be briefly replaced by Steve Ludwin. By the end of 1994, Levitation had split up and its members went their separate ways (although Hayes, Francolini and O'Keefe would reunite four years later as Dark Star).
Early Milk And Honey Band (1994: "Round The Sun").
The Milk And Honey Band began life as a Robert White solo project. It was recorded in between commitments with Levitation - in part, as an antidote to the frustrations of life in that band.
For the initial recordings, White sang lead vocals and played all instruments (drums, guitars, keyboards, bass guitar, mandolin and percussion) and also handled engineering and production. These tracks made up the project’s first album "Round The Sun", which was released on Rough Trade Records in 1994. This album was more notably lo-fi than subsequent recordings, and featured musical elements that would be phased out of later Milk And Honey Band material. Several tracks had light classical or light-instrumental elements (emphasizing a nostalgic tone similar to that sometimes used in progressive rock) or a heavier dark-psychedelia approach.
Building a full band (1996–2000).
Following the collapse of Levitation, White relocated to Brighton and pursued a steady career in commercial music production, while simultaneously building up a stock of Milk And Honey Band songs for future release. In 1996, he presented Rough Trade with material for a new album but found that the label was unable to release it.
Opting to put together a full band, White recruited Richard Yale (bass, acoustic guitar, keyboards and backing vocals) and his former Zag And The Coloured Beads bandmate Michael Tubb (electric and acoustic guitars, keyboards and backing vocals). Both Tubb and Yale have stayed with The Milk and Honey Band ever since.
Regarding the band’s working arrangements, White has commented "I do write the majority of the tunes, but without Richard and Michael's help this group...well, it wouldn't be a group for starters. They keep me sane and generally massage my ego just enough to keep me buoyed without adding too much to the 'ego mountain that is Robert'. It's a bit like the old it's-my-ball-and-I-say-when-you-can-play-with-it syndrome, but as I happen to be the one lucky enough to have a studio at home then most of the recording/rehearsing activities of The Milk & Honey Band happen here." 
Return to action (2001 to 2003: "Boy From The Moon").
Attempts to sign the band to major labels proved unsuccessful due to the latter's insistence on attempting to reshape and direct the band (on one occasion, even attempting to demote White from the position of lead singer). In order to maintain control, White retreated and chose to write and record songs to his own schedule.
The next sign of Milk And Honey Band activity was in 2001 with the release of the "Boy From The Moon" album on the small Manchester independent label Uglyman Records. A much more polished effort than its predecessor, the record was atmospheric and detailed with a more spacious production sound. Uglyman's resources were limited and the record had difficulty in reaching a wide audience. However, one copy of the album reached XTC singer Andy Partridge, who was setting up his own record label and invited The Milk and Honey Band to sign to it.
Ape Records years (2004 to 2010).
The Milk And Honey Band signed a distribution deal with Partridge’s label, Ape Records, in 2004 and released a third album "The Secret Life Of The Milk And Honey Band". This was in many ways a continuation of the work on the previous album. It contained four reissued songs from "Boy From The Moon" – the title track, "Sold My Star", "Satellite" and "Junior" (the last of which was retitled "Message")
The band later released two download-only albums via Ape. These were compilations of both previously released and unreleased material. "*Crumbs!* Volume One" included more "Boy From The Moon" tracks ("Touched The Sun", "Wonderful", "Can’t Sleep", and an a cappella version of "Sold My Star") as did "*Crumbs!* Volume Two" ("500 Miles", "You’re The One", "Saved Again" and an acoustic version of "San Francisco").
The Milk And Honey Band played their first low-key acoustic concerts in Brighton in 2004. The band later added two extra members for live concerts - Dan Burke on keyboards, guitar and backing vocals and Christian Parsons (Polak, Astrid Williamson) on drums.
In March 2009, the band released their fourth full album, "Dog Eared Moonlight", on Ape Records. At around the same time, Burke and Parsons were confirmed as full members of the band, although much of the music on the album had been recorded by Robert White on his own.
In November 2010, Ape Records released a download-only album "In Colour", comprising twelve tracks recorded at the same time as "Dog Eared Moonlight". Three hundred physical copies of the album were also produced and made available. "In Colour" featured a more integrated full-band approach than "Dog Eared Moonlight".
Current activity & Robert White solo work.
Since the release of "In Colour", the Milk And Honey Band has been inactive (although no split has been confirmed, and the band has often had quiet periods). In the meantime, Robert White has begun releasing work under his own name.
In December 2010, a Robert White cover version of the Sea Nymphs song "Lily White's Party" (recorded in collaboration with Andy Partridge) appeared on "", a fundraising compilation album to benefit the hospitalised Cardiacs/Sea Nymphs leader Tim Smith.
On 13 February 2013, Robert White released a solo cover version of the Gillian Welch song "Everything Is Free" as a video-only single.

Hericiaceae

The Hericiaceae are a family of fungi in the order Russulales. The best known genus is "Hericium", species of which are valued for their medicinal properties in Oriental medicine. Taxa are mainly known from north temperate regions, and are saprobic on rotting wood. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that "Hericiaceae" belongs to the russuloid clade of homobasidiomycetes, and morphological and molecular evidence links it with the families Auriscalpiaceae, Bondarzewiaceae and Echinodontiaceae.
Description.
Species of this family commonly have fruiting bodies with pegs, spines, or teeth hanging from the hymenium.

Repugnant battle honours of the Indian Army

The Government of India has declared repugnant some battle honours earned by Indian Army units, which are descended from erstwhile units of the British East India Company. Indian Army units do not inscribe these battle honours on their colours and do not celebrate commemoration days associated with these battles. This decision was taken post-independence regarding those battle honours concerned with the subjugation of India and in some cases, neighbouring countries.
List of repugnant battle honours.
Repugnant battle honours include :
Non-repugnant battle honours.
The earliest battle honour held by the modern Indian Army which is not repugnant and can be emblazoned on colours is "Bourbon" (dated 8 July 1810) which is held by the 3rd Battalion, the Brigade of the Guards. Battle honours prior to this period have either been lost due to disbandment, are now held only by units transferred to Pakistan during Partition, or are repugnant.
Other pre-World War I battle honours not considered repugnant are as follows :

Siennica is a village in Mińsk County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Siennica. It lies approximately south of Mińsk Mazowiecki and east of Warsaw.
The village has a population of 2,600.
Historical overview.
The village was first mentioned in early 15th century as Szenic. In 1526 Princess Anna founded the town of Janów at the site of Siennica. Two years later, a Catholic parish was established there. Notably, in 1564 the town returned to its old name according to census. In 1577 a new church was built with larch bales in place of an old one. A second church was constructed in 1693–1698, augmented by the construction of a monastery and church of Blessed Virgin Mary in 1749–1760. In 1864 the Russian imperial authorities liquidated the monastery (for more details see: Anti-Polish sentiment); nevertheless, two years later a theological college was founded there by the Catholics. In 1869 Siennica lost its civic rights by a Tsarist decree.
On September 13, 1939, Nazi German troops entered Siennica and burned it down. Following Operation Barbarossa they deported about 700 Jewish residents of town to extermination camps.
The Red Army arrived on July 30, 1944, and in the course of action burned down the monastery church.

Catherine Power (born November 15, 1984) is a Canadian wrestler, better known by her ring names, Cat Power and Haley Rogers. She has worked for the promotions Blood Sweat and Ears, Border City Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Xtreme, Shimmer Women Athletes, and Women's Extreme Wrestling.
Professional wrestling career.
Training and debut.
Power decided to become a professional wrestler after attending World Wrestling Federation's WrestleMania 18 in 2002 in Toronto. After graduating from high school, Power felt pressured to attend college. She, however, left the University College of Cape Breton after her second year to attend the Can-Am Wrestling School in Windsor, Ontario in 2004. She originally worked under the name Haley Rogers, which is a combination of her mother’s family surnames. Her first match was with Blood Sweat and Ears in Toronto. In Ontario, she worked a series of matches with Jennifer Blake. Eight months after her debut, she sent tapes to Shimmer Women Athletes in an attempt to join the promotion, but she was turned down due to lack of experience.
SHIMMER Women Athletes (2008-present).
She eventually joined Shimmer Women Athletes and was defeated by Allison Danger in her tryout match. She debuted officially as part of Volume 18 where she lost to Ariel. She came back as part of the Battle Royal on Volume 19 but was not able to score the win. Later in the night she teamed with Veronika Vice in a losing effort to the Ashley Lane and Nevaeh. On Volume 20, after re-aggravating Daffney's knee injury, she defeated Daffney with a Figure Four Leg Lock. As part of the Volume 21 she lost to Daffney in a rematch and later in the night she lost to Danyah. On Volume 23, in the opening match, she lost to Nikki Roxx. Later in the night, as part of Volume 24, she lost to Serena Deeb. On June 3, as part of Volume 25, she was able to score her second victory in Shimmer by defeating Rachel Summerlyn, in a match that also involved Ariel and Kellie Skater. 
After missing Volume 26 she came back on November 8, 2009, as part of the Volume 27, where she defeated Portuguese Princess Ariel in a re-match from Volume 18 with Daizee Haze as special guest referee. Later in the night on Volume 28 she was defeated by Mercedes Martinez after a fisherman buster. As part of Volume 29 she wrestled and lost to "Everybody's Favourite Girlfriend" Jessie McKay via pinfall. Later that night she competed in a rematch from NCW Femmes Fatales 2 against LuFisto but this time she lost via Burning Hammer. After missing Volume 31 she finally got a win over Nevaeh.
NCW Femmes Fatales (2010).
Power made her debut for NCW Femmes Fatales on their second show as a villain on February 6, 2010, where she defeated LuFisto by disqualification. Later in the night she attacked Cheerleader Melissa during her match with Kalamity, leading a match where LuFisto and Melissa defeated Power and Kalamity. She scored her first victory via pinfall on Volume 3, when she defeated Mistress Belmont. On Volume 4, Power lost to Courtney Rush in a triple threat match that included Sassy Stephie, and later attacked Rush after the match. She would lose again to Rush in a Street Fight at Volume 5, and the two competitors shook hands afterwards.
Power returned to NCW Femmes Fatales as a fan favorite at Volume 9, teaming with former rival Courtney Rush and Xandra Bale in a losing effort against the Midwest Militia (Jessicka Havok, Allysin Kay, and Sassy Stephie). Power took part in both parts of Volume 10, losing singles matches to Saraya Knight (Part 1) and Kellie Skater (Part 2).

The Frontier Gandhi: Badshah Khan, a Torch for Peace, a documentary released in 2008, is the first full film account of Pashtun leader and non violent activist Abdul Ghaffar Khan, also known as Badshah Khan or Bacha Khan.
The documentary is the work of filmmaker and writer T.C. McLuhan, daughter of the Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who spent 21 years to bring the story to the screen after an acquaintance gave her "Nonviolent Soldier of Islam".
The voice of Ghaffar Khan is played by Indian actor Om Puri and includes interviews with elderly activists of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement as well as major political figures in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.
The film had its Middle-Eastern premier at the 3rd Middle East International Film Festival in Abu Dhabi in October, 2009, where it won the top award for documentary films. The BBC quoted Afrasiab Khattak, head of the Awami National Party in North-West Frontier Province, as saying that "This film will help a lot in introducing Badshah Khan to the rest of the world."
McLuhan has stated that she believes the film counters stereotypes. McLuhan reported encountering resistance both in making the film and in marketing it, and stated that one reason was

Zag and the Coloured Beads

Zag And The Coloured Beads are an English experimental rock band. 
Blending elements of psychedelic rock and progressive rock, the band were initially active in the 1980s London free-festival scene and featured several members who went on to subsequent projects including Ring, Levitation and The Milk And Honey Band. Splitting up in 1990, the band eventually reformed in 2006 with a different lineup. 
Sound and influences.
The band's singer/guitarist Steve Arthur remembers that Zag And The Coloured Beads "evolved pretty much independently, as a band who played complicated tunes in a ragged/bluesy style." Music sometimes "emerged out of jamming, noodling, wandering in the evenings and varied loitering." 
The band have cited Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, Cardiacs, Philip Glass and Can as central influences over the years, "mixed up with all sorts of post-punk albums of the time ("Return Of The Duritti Column", "Marquee Moon", "Wilder" by Teardrop Explodes, Killing Joke...)" as well as "old jazz, Trumpton music, plus all the usual Mojo reader's old records."
History.
Zag And The Coloured Beads was formed in Croydon and began playing live in 1982 (although demo tapes had been recorded as far back as 1979). The band initially featured frontman Zag (real name Ian Faichne), who departed in 1983 to form Ring. The most familiar lineup was Steve Arthur (vocals and guitars), Michael "Mik" Tubb (guitar, bass, synthesizer, vocals), Paul Howard (bass, guitar, vocals), Robert White (bass, keyboards, vocals), and Tom Rosenbloom (drums). The instrumentation was flexible, with plenty of instrument-swapping both live and on record. The band occasionally also played under pseudonyms such as Ming And The Fods.
For the members, the band was just one of several ongoing projects. Tubb and Howard also played in Bing Organ's Beastly Scrapings; White played in Ring; both White and Howard played in jazz-rock band Peru; and all members bar Tubb occasionally played in the Purple People Eaters.
Zag And The Coloured Beads recorded their first cassette album, "Loaf of Legs" during 1984 and 1985, using a portastudio. The followup, 1987's "Sawtooth Gripmaster" saw the band adding eight-track recording capabilities.
Robert White departed in late 1988 to concentrate on Ring and subsequently Levitation and The Milk And Honey Band (he would eventually be joined in the latter by Tubb). Paul Howard left in 1989 and the band continued for a while as a trio of Steve Arthur, Mik Tubb and Tom Rosenbloom.
Wryneck.
The remaining band members gradually became another band, 'Wryneck'. 
Steve Arthur recalls "without Paul to share bass duties with Mik, we stopped swapping instruments around... Initially I wanted to get away from the Beads' jokiness, and be taken seriously, ma-a-n, so in (came) a mixture of more straightforward rock, woozy atmospheres and non-specific angst. This was the era of shoegazing, Dinosaur Jr. and Snub TV. Plus I saw Levitation doing very well with these huge, intense songs. That was definitely a kick up the backside, though I was caught between wanting to copy them and wanting to be utterly different. 
"There was a group we knew called The Belltower who were an influence too - really driving psychedelic power pop. As time wore on and Levitation burned out, our love of reliable old faves like Led Zep, James Brown etc. came more to the fore. Re. the latter, even with the rhythm section on top form (and it was) funk is difficult for a trio to do well - it needs other instruments. We drafted in Leisurely on bongos, but sadly the Hammonds, horns and backing vocals stayed in our imaginations."
Wryneck continued until 1993 and recorded two cassette albums. "Wryneck" (1990) and "Instant Confidence" (1993). Various lineups of the band continued to work sporadically until 1998.
Zag And The Coloured Beads reunion.
Steve Arthur, Michael Tubb and Paul Howard reformed Zag And The Coloured Beads in 2006 with new members James Larcombe (keyboards, from Stars In Battledress and North Sea Radio Orchestra) and Keith Roche (drums). In 2007, Roche was replaced by Paul "Helocolin" Johnson. 
To date, the revived band has not released any new recordings, although both "Loaf of Legs" and "Sawtooth Gripmaster" were reissued as CD albums to sell at live concerts. A typically lively Zag and the Coloured Beads set can be seen in Nick Booth's 2009 film "Hollow Legs", which can be seen here: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHUgU-eh-dc&feature=channel], the band appear at 06.10, after a satirical introduction. The Beads perform Bernard Crapshit, a song Mik Tubb wrote in 1986 about the actor Bernard Cribbins. The end credits erroneously refer to the song as A Loaf of Legs, which was the name of the Beads first album.
Along with his work in Croydon band Junk Time Pate, Mik Tubb has also developed an interest in gambling on horse racing. At Plumpton races in the winter of 2010 he almost won a large sum on a horse called Uncle Eli, which unfortunately unseated its jockey, Grand National winner Liam Treadwell at the final hurdle, resulting in the destruction of Tubb's wager.
There has been talk of a new band being formed between Mik Tubb and Paul Howard, called Mik Tubb's Military Pickle.

Peter J. Wallison

Peter J. Wallison (born June 6, 1941, in New York City) is a lawyer and the Arthur F. Burns Fellow in Financial Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, who, in 1999, correctly predicted the housing/banking crisis of 2007/2008. He specializes in financial markets deregulation. He was White House Counsel during the Tower Commission's inquiry into the Iran Contra Affair. He was a frequent commentator in the mass media on the Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Financial crisis of 2007–2008, and related matters.
Personal.
Wallison was born in New York City, and educated at the Capitol Page School and Harvard University (A.B. 1963, LL.B. 1966), where he was President of the Young Republicans. 
He was admitted to the bar of New York state in 1967.
Emanuel Celler appointed him a United States House of Representatives Page when he was about 14, and he served for most of his high school years. The Democrats controlled the patronage, but assigned some pages, such as Wallison, to the minority party. This experience helped him become a Republican.
He was a Rockefeller Republican before becoming a Reagan Republican.
On November 24, 1966, he married the former Frieda Koslow (born in New York January 15, 1943, A.B. Smith College 1963, LL.B. Harvard Law School 1966 admitted to New York bar in 1967, D.C. bar 1982). They have three children, Ethan S., Jeremy L. (born not later than 1972), Rebecca K. Mrs. Wallison develops real estate in Snowmass, Colorado.
They split their time between homes in Colorado and in Washington, D.C.
Other.
In 1999, Wallison told New York Times reporter Steven A. Holmes that the expansion of mortgage loans by reducing the amount borrowers have to put down and extending loans to so-called subprime borrowers was creating a situation where Fannie Mae was taking on significantly more risk. "From the perspective of many people, including me, this is another thrift industry growing up around us," he said. "If they fail, the government will have to step up and bail them out the way it stepped up and bailed out the thrift industry." The article pointed out that the Clinton Administration had put pressure on Fannie Mae to lower standards "to expand loans among low and moderate income people."
Wallison gave a eulogy at a memorial service for Don Regan in June 2003.
Wallison's writing on the cause of the Financial crisis of 2007–08 have brought much comment. In December, 2011, the New York Times financial columnist Joe Nocera stated that Wallison had "almost single-handedly created the myth that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac caused the financial crisis." Calling it "a big lie," Nocera suggested that Wallison had engaged in a deliberate deception. Economist Paul Krugman has also accused Wallison of deception, criticizing him for — among other things — attacking Fannie and Freddie in a magazine article just a year before the subprime mortgage collapse for not doing a "better job of providing affordable home financing to a neglected portion of the mortgage market." This neglected portion consisted of "African-American ... Hispanic", and "low-income borrowers". Wallison cites New York Times columnist Gretchen Morgenson exposing how "Democratic political operative Jim Johnson turned Fannie Mae into a political machine", and dismisses the exoneration of the GSEs as "the big lie."

Radzanów is a village in Mława County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland, approximately south-west of Mława and north-west of Warsaw. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Radzanów.
The village lies on the Wkra river. It has a population of 930, with the population of the surrounding gmina exceeding 4,000 inhabitants.
History.
In the 13th century Radzanów was a residence of the Radzanowski family, which expired in 1630. They bore the Prawdzic coat of arms. The settlement received town privileges based on Chełmno rights in 1400 from Mazovian Prince Siemowit IV. It legally held a weekly market and an annual fair. A castle built on the bank of Wkra river during the period was completely destroyed during the Swedish invasion in the 17th century. The current village was stripped of its town rights in 1869 by the Tsarist administration of partitioned Poland.
Around 1380 a parish was established in Radzanów that erected its first church, mentioned in 1439. The church was destroyed in around 1590, rebuilt in around 1598 and survived until the early 18th century. A second church was built in 1734. However, it was not until 1870 that the first brick-and-mortar church was erected in Radzanów.
Jewish community.
Jews began to settle in Radzanów () in considerable numbers around the second half of the 18th century as a result of a privilege issued by the town's owner Dorota Niszczycka, the Chamberlain of Płock from the Karczewski clan. She allocated to the Jewish Kehilla two streets and a plot of her land for a Jewish cemetery and a synagogue, as well as the right to trade in all goods and the production of alcohol. The cemetery, which was established in 1765 near the Wkra river (7,500 sq m in size), was levelled by the German occupiers in World War II and all the tombstones were removed. 
By 1865 the Jews accounted for 45 percent of the town's inhabitants. In the second half of the 19th century the Kehilla build a brick synagogue designed by S. Kmita with Moorish-style motifs, in place of the original wooden one. The Jewish community (population 532 by 1900) was completely destroyed in the Holocaust, with about 200 of its members deported in January 1942 to the ghetto in Mława, and from there to Treblinka and Auschwitz death camps in November 1942. Today there are no Jews in Radzanów. The synagogue houses the town's public library. It has been entered into the national register of historic monuments in 1975 and repaired in 1986. 
Economy.
Radzanów and its county (with Bieżuń and Żuromin nearby) is one of the largest producers of poultry and eggs in the Mazovia. A waste treatment plant in the town called "Bacutil" services the northern part of the province, while the social infrastructure includes a medical clinic, post office, cultural centre and public library, as well as a number of stores and service stations. The water-supply pipes cover all of the "gmina". The "Era GSM" cell-phone tower was erected in 2001.

Orion Cinema Network, most commonly known by the abbreviation OCN, is a movie channel on basic cable throughout South Korea, owned by CJ E&M. In the 2000s it became the most viewed station in South Korea, which prompted them to create their widely recognized English-language slogan, "Korea number-one channel." With cable TV penetration quite high in South Korea, OCN is a popular movie resource.
OCN's lineup is a mixture of movies from several years ago or earlier, particularly during the daytime, with more recent films during evening prime-time hours. They do not air movies that are as recent as those of competitor CatchOn, a pay service offered on cable TV. They also show episodes of popular overseas television series, mostly from the United States.

Jimmy &quot;Orion&quot; Ellis

Jimmy Hughes Bell (February 26, 1945 – December 12, 1998) was known internationally for his gifted singing ability and dynamic personal appearances. He has appeared with Loretta Lynn, Jerry Lee Lewis, Tammy Wynette, Ricky Skaggs, Lee Greenwood, Gary Morris, the Oak Ridge Boys and many others.
Backed by the Jordanaires and opening act Sherry Carlisle, Orion sang to a packed house on August 12, 1997 at Nashville's Nightlife Theater. In an outstanding article in The Nashville Tennessean newspaper on August 12, 1997, it was reported that "Orion having the same vocal cords as Elvis Presley has been both a kiss and a curse, but Orion sings his own tune."
Biography.
Jimmy was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi on February 26 of 1945, into a single parent home. Coincidentally, like Elvis, his mother's name was Gladys. When he was two, Gladys and Jimmy moved to Birmingham where he was put up for adoption. Young Jimmy was taken in by R.F. Ellis and his wife Mary Faye, where Jimmy's last name was changed to Ellis.
While not much is known of Jimmy's early musical development, he told Goldmine magazine in 1985 that his idols included Elvis, Ray Price and Eddy Arnold and that his first public appearance was at the age of 17 at Orrville High's "Religious Emphasis Week". He sang "Peace In The Valley". Subsequently, Jimmy won the finals of a statewide talent contest in Alabama where he sang Unchained Melody and The Days of Wine and Roses accompanied only by a piano. The prizes: a trip to the Ted Mack Amateur Hour and a $1,000 savings bond.
Jimmy later settled into an athletic two-year scholarship at Middle Georgia Junior College in the town of Cochran.
Jimmy transferred to Livingston State University where he started playing small clubs. He got a "One Shot Deal" with Challenger Records (MCA) in 1974 before moving to the small Boblo Records label. One of his five singles for Boblo was "I'm Not Trying To Be Elvis".
Now, the music industry is filled with many strange tales of artists whose lives took unexpected turns on the winding road to success, but the saga of singer Jimmy Ellis is perhaps one of the weirdest of them all. He was professionally known as Orion, and his double-edged claim to fame was that his natural speaking and singing voice sounded almost exactly like that of Elvis Presley. Ellis hailed from Orrville, Alabama and began his recording career in 1964.
In 1978 Jimmy signed with the new owner of Sun Records, Shelby Singleton. Earlier, in 1972, Jimmy had recorded a cover of Elvis' first Sun single, "That's Alright, Mama" and "Blue Moon of Kentucky", in Florida. It was offered to Shelby Singleton at Sun by the Florida record producer, Finlay Duncan. That 1972 single was released on the Sun label with a question mark appearing on the record in place of the artist's name. This marketing tactic effectively, and inadvertently, started the whole "Elvis is alive" conspiracy theory, although it would be another six years before other forces conspired to give it lift-off and mainstream prominence.
After his 1978 signing, Jimmy's star was on the ascendancy as he became intertwined in a complex and clever marketing campaign involving books, records, a mysterious cassette tape recording made after Elvis' alleged death and a mask. For a while Jimmy became the "new" Elvis.
Capitalising on Jimmy's close vocal similarity to Elvis, the mask and clever imagery (see "Reborn" album cover), people like Shelby Singleton, Gail Brewer-Giorgio and Gene Arthur enjoyed a financially fruitful time, at least for a few years. Brewer-Giorgio had been made aware of Jimmy and his vocal resemblance to Elvis by her friend, Carol Halupke, in 1980 when they were considering possible lead actors for the proposed but unrealised film based on her fiction novel, "Orion".
In 1980, Cash Box Magazine included Orion’s next two albums, Sunrise and Trio Plus (where his voice was overdubbed on old Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and Charlie Rich cuts), in their list of Top 75 albums.
The following year, the magazine rated him one of the three most promising male Country artists. Orion continued to put singles on the Country chart, A Stranger In My Place, Texas Tea and Am I That Easy To Forget which all reached the Top 70 in 1980.
The following year, he had a quartet of chart records, none of which fared any better, although of interest are his versions of U.K. Rockabilly band Matchbox’s hit, "Rockabilly Rebel" and Queen’s "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", both of which, although contemporary, bore a Rockabilly sound.
His final Country chart single was the Top 70 double-sided entrant, Morning, Noon and Night/Honky Tonk Heaven. By 1983, however, the charade had definitely lost its charm for Ellis/Orion. His desire to be taken seriously by the music industry as an artist in his own right caused him to sever his connections with Sun and strip off the mask before a capacity crowd at the Eastern States Exposition, vowing never to wear it again. (When his career subsequently waned, he re-donned the mask in 1987.)
Not a true Elvis impersonator in the sense that he did not make a career of recording and performing Elvis’ material, Orion had always been confronted with the irony that unless he altered his natural vocal intonations, he could not avoid sounding incredibly like the real Presley.
His recording of "I’m Trying Not To Sound Like Elvis", seems like a "cri de coeur."
Since making his debut as a Sun recording artist in 1979, Orion recorded 11 albums and appeared on shows with the Oak Ridge Boys, Jerry Lee Lewis, Reba McEntire, Ricky Skaggs, Lee Greenwood, Ronnie Milsap and Dionne Warwick.
Life as "Orion".
Shelby Singleton of Sun International decided to disguise Ellis' identity on his first Sun single, "That's All Right (Mama)"/"Blue Moon of Kentucky" "(Sun 1129)", leaving listeners to speculate that the songs might be alternate takes of Elvis' first two songs. Instead of listing Ellis' first album on the label, Singleton printed a question mark. Ellis first album appearance for Sun was as an unidentified singer singing duet with Jerry Lee Lewis on ten tracks of the 1978 album "Duets" "(Sun 1011)". Charlie Rich sang along with Lewis on two other songs. Again, the speculation was that Elvis had sung on the songs, particularly "Save the Last Dance for Me".
In 1979 Jimmy Ellis finally merged with an identity, but it still wasn't himself. He appeared as Orion Eckley Darnell, the character created August 16, 1977, by a Marietta , housewife Gail Brewer-Giorgo. Her 1978 novel "Orion" told the story of a rock and roll singer, very much like Elvis. In the novel, Orion faked his own death, leading real-world conspiracy theorists to believe that Orion was the true story of Elvis.
On Orion's 1979 debut album, "Reborn" "(Sun 1912)". Ellis appeared on the album cover wearing a mask over his eyes. The album featured some excellent songs including "Ebony Eyes", "Honey", and "Washing Machine". They were sung in the same style in which Elvis would have sung them.
Ellis's Orion character claimed to have been managed by one Colonel Mac Weiman, and have been born in Ribbonsville, Tennessee on December 31, 1931. Listeners of Orion were initially split into two camps: those who knew that Orion was Jimmy Ellis just having some fun sounding like Elvis, and others who sincerely believed or wanted to believe that he was truly Elvis coming back on the scene after faking his own death. As Orion, Ellis reached Billboards country chart with nine singles.
A fine talent in his own right, Ellis recorded the song "I'm Not Trying" "(Boblo 536)" and the album By "Request - Ellis Sings Elvis" "(Boblo 78-829)"
Ellis made a public confession in 1983, admitting he was Orion. He left Sun Records, never again appearing to the public as Orion until the 1990s.
One night in Mobile, Alabama in 1987 Jimmy had stopped and asked two guys for directions to a restaurant. The guys accused Jimmy of being a "cop". One of the men took a 22 rifle from his car and the other guy searched Jimmy's pockets for money. Jimmy put up some resistance and attempted to flee from the thugs. They then shot Jimmy as he ran from the guys after which the thugs fled. Jimmy survived and was back performing later that year.
Death.
Ellis was gunned down in his Alabama Pawn Shop on December 12, 1998. He was standing before the display counter in his Jimmy's Pawn and Package Store just after noon Saturday when the gunman burst in and shot Ellis and his ex-wife, Elaine Thompson, killing them both. An employee, Helen King, suffered minor injuries.
"Mr. Ellis never had time to do nothing or say nothing," Dallas County Sheriff Harris Huffman Jr. told APB News. "He just opened fire in seconds and hit Mr. Ellis in the side."
The gunman, whom police believe is Plantersville resident Jeffery James Lee, then fired twice more in an attempt to blast Ellis a second time as he struggled to find a haven behind a computer desk, Huffman said.
The shot missed, and then Lee allegedly turned his attention to the cash register, which he knocked off the counter after he could not open it, Huffman said. He then dropped the gun, fled the store and drove off in a car with two accomplices, authorities said.
Huffman said King, who played dead, was treated and released from a hospital for her hand wound. Ellis died in his store about 10 minutes after the attack, Huffman said.
Later that day, sheriff's deputies caught up with the two alleged accomplices, Andre Darren Lee, 19, who is the alleged gunman's brother, and Jerry Dewayne Johnson, 17, who is his cousin. Police later found Lee holed up in a motel about 30 miles outside Atlanta. All three are being held without bail and are facing the possibility of the death penalty on two counts of capital murder, authorities said. Lee was since sentenced to death in 2000.
Ellis was buried at New Live Oak Cemetery in Selma (Dallas County) Alabama.

Moshe Smoira

Moshe Smoira (, born 25 October 1888, died 8 October 1961) was an Israeli jurist and the first President of the Supreme Court of Israel.
Biography.
Smoira was born in 1888 in Königsberg, in the German Empire to Leiser and Perel, Hasidic immigrants from Russia. He studied Hebrew and became a Zionist. His future wife, Esther Horovitz from Minsk, was a relative of Zalman Shazar.
He studied law at Heidelberg University, but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which he joined the German Army and was later wounded in action. After the war, he organized Hebrew courses in Berlin and later received his doctorate in jurisprudence from the University of Giessen as well as an M.A. in Semitic languages.
In 1921 he emigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine and opened a practice in Jerusalem. He was a partner of Pinchas Rosen, who later became the Israeli Justice Minister, and was associated with Mapai. He was invited by the Mandate authorities to teach at the Jerusalem Law School and became a lecturer there. He was the lawyer for the Histadrut. He specialized in Labor law and was one of the initiators and drafters of the Mandatory Law of compensation to dismissed workers.
In the 1930s he was appointed President of the Court of Honor of the World Zionist Organization and President of the Association of Jewish Lawyers in Eretz Israel. After the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948 he was appointed President of the Supreme Court. He did not consider the Declaration of Independence a legally binding document.
In 1954 he retired due to a terminal illness and was succeeded by Yitzhak Olshan. He died in 1961 in Jerusalem. In 1989, Israel issued a stamp in his honour. His daughter, Michal, married Supreme Court judge Haim Cohn.

Sphagesaurus

Sphagesaurus is an extinct genus of sphagesaurid notosuchian crocodylomorph from the Late Cretaceous of southwest São Paulo, southern Brazil.
Species and discovery.
"Sphagesaurus" was first described and named by Llewellyn Ivor Price in 1950 and the type species is "S. huenei". "S. huenei" was described by Price (1950) on the basis of two isolated molariform maxillary teeth, the holotype DGM 332-R and the referred specimen DGM 333-R. The holotype was found in a railway cut between the cities of Presidente Bernardes and Santo Anastacio in the state of São Paulo, while DGM 333-R was found near Catanduva city of São Paulo, both from the Bauru Group. Bertini "et al." (1993) referred the isolated molariform tooth, URC-R 015 from Locality 99 of the Adamantina Formation, to "S. huenei", and referred the DGM specimens to the same formatiom.
Kellner "et al." (1995) and Kellner & Campos (1999) tentatively assigned DGM 1411-R, a nearly complete but crushed anterior portion of the skull and lower jaw, to "S. huenei" and then to "S." sp. It was found near Presidente Prudente city of southwest São Paulo, from the Adamantina Formation of the Bauru Basin. It was reassigned to a new genus and species, "Caryonosuchus pricei", by Kellner "et al." (2011). They also considered the type material of "S. huenei" to be undiagnosable, making the species a "nomen dubium".
Pol (2003) described the only diagnosable specimen, RCL-100 a nearly complete skull, that is currently considered to belong to "Sphagesaurus". It consists of the rostrum, orbital and temporal regions, except for its dorsal elements. A mandibular fragment corresponding to the dentary symphysis was found in natural occluding position. The specimen was collected at the sediments of the Adamantina Formation during the construction of the new railroad station of Buenopolis city of São Paulo.
A second species, "S. montealtensis" has also been described from the Late Cretaceous of Brazil. It was named by Marco Brandalise de Andrade and Reinaldo J. Bertini in 2008, on the basis of MPMA 15-001/90, a nearly complete skull and mandible preserved in occlusion. It was collected from the Bairro Cachoeira locality at the base of the Serra da Água Limpa, about 8km northwest of Monte Alto city of northern São Paulo, from the Adamantina Formation. In 2013, this specimen was reassigned to the closely related notosuchian genus "Caipirasuchus", creating the "combinatio nova" "Caipirasuchus montealtensis". The type species of the genus, "C. paulistanus", is known only from the holotype specimen MPMA 67-0001/00, an almost complete and undeformed skull and mandible with teeth (only three teeth are missing) and partial postcranium, from a single individual. It was found on the São Francisco Farm, in Homem de Mello, the rural area of Monte Alto County, also from the Adamantina Formation. "S. montealtensis" was reassigned "Caipirasuchus" on the basis of a newly discovered specimen referrable to it. MPMA 68-0003/12 consists of a nearly complete cranium and mandible and a posterior portion of the post-cranium. It was discovered in the municipality of Catanduva, northern São Paulo, from the Adamantina Formation. At least five synapomorphies unite the species, and a phylogenetic analysis found them to be sister taxa.

List of Monkey Dust characters

The following is a list of all major recurring characters in the BBC animated television series Monkey Dust.
Series one.
Labia.
A series of sketches featuring a morally dubious consultancy company begin several episodes. Initially a satire on the Royal Mail renaming itself Consignia, the company charges large amounts of money on ridiculous rebranding exercises, e. g. renaming cancer as "Closure" and advertising it as an attractive end-of-life option or rebranding the Fire Service as 'Icarus' to combat their reputation as an "essentially reactive organisation" by going into the frothy coffee business.
The man who invents their new brand names is an international adventurer who looks like Lord Byron. The company's offices are in the shape of their logo, just like the former NatWest Tower (Tower 42).
Clive Pringle.
In each episode, Clive walks slowly through the city back home, which is located in a tower block of high-rise flats. He arrives home (sometimes months or even years) late and when questioned by his wife as to his whereabouts, his excuses swiftly collapse into the plots of well-known fiction. Examples include "The Lord of the Rings", "", "Dune", "24", a specified episode of "The A-Team", the nursery rhyme "Humpty Dumpty", the song "Hotel California" by the Eagles, and even The Holy Bible...which his wife stops him on because she knows he will recite the whole Bible to her. When his long-suffering wife coolly points out his obvious plagiarism, Clive is forced to reveal his actual whereabouts. This usually involves something sexually degrading, such as bestiality or S&M, and, on one memorable occasion prior to being humiliated, his desperate catch-phrase is: "... and "that", darling, is what "really" happened!" As the series progresses, his wife eventually reaches the point where she cuts him short in one episode (she is due to meet her friend Janice in five minutes), and in another she cuts him off as he is about to reveal a spoiler for the next episode of 24, which she hasn't seen yet. In one, as soon as Clive arrives, she barks out: ""Excuse?"" Clive: "I got lost on the common!" ""Theme?"" "Scott's Polar Expedition 1910-1912!" ""Reality?"" "I was getting tag-fucked in a pub toilet." At one point, Clive is abducted by aliens who cover him in lipstick marks and beer. When Clive says he has to get home, the aliens tell him to say exactly what happened. Unfortunately, because Clive is like The Boy Who Cried Wolf, he replies, "Actually, I haven't got that good of a track record." In the final Liar Clive skit, she has actually left him at last, and it is revealed that he is delivering his pathetic excuses to only himself in a mirror, meaning he can finally smile ironically and conclude; "I knew "you" would believe me!"
Liar Clive's skits are always prefaced by him walking home at night to the sound of "Lovely Head" by Goldfrapp.
Ivan Dobsky.
Designed & directed by British animation director / illustrator Steve May, Ivan Dobsky is a supposed notorious criminal, known as "the Meat-Safe Murderer", held in custody in the high-security H.M. Prison Crowmarsh, and, after its destruction at Ivan's hand at the end of Series 1, New Crowmarch PLC High Security Prison. Despite his repeated protests that he "never done it" and that his confession had been coerced by various methods of police torture and brutality, he was convicted for killing a typist at a meat-safe in 1974 by strangling her with a pair of ladies' pants. Dobsky bears more than a passing resemblance to the true case of wrongly-convicted Stefan Kiszko.
Dobsky has the mental age of a four-year-old child, speaks in a soft, flowing North East English accent, and generally gives the impression of being a completely harmless simpleton. However, the prison warders describe him as the most dangerous man in Western Europe, and keep him in strict confinement, restrained by methods very similar to those used for Hannibal Lecter in Jonathan Demme's film version of "The Silence of the Lambs".
Early episodes depict him being pardoned and released when DNA evidence exonerating him comes to light. During his time in custody he has been oblivious to changes taking place in the world outside the prison walls, and thus when he attempts to rejoin society he appears as a throw-back to the 1970s. He joyfully rides out of jail on his space hopper (called "Mr Hoppy") only to find things have changed too much for him to understand. After deciding he'd rather remain in prison than to face the modern world, he ends up actually committing a murder in order to be reincarcerated.
Mr. Hoppy seems to have a mind and will of his own, carries on conversations with Dobsky, and often encourages him into violent action. The two characters are implied to represent different manifestations of a multiple personality disorder, in which Dobsky is an unwitting innocent and Mr. Hoppy a sociopathic monster. For the most part Dobsky is able successfully to remain in control, until the conclusion of the first series ends with his mind snapping and him dismembering the prison staff to construct a horrific space hopper made from bits of their bodies (on which he rides to freedom to the music of "Sunrise" by Pulp).
In the second series Ivan marries a prison visitor who then becomes the object of Mr. Hoppy's jealousy and is brutally murdered by him.
Many celebrities appear to campaign to free Ivan from prison, including Brad Pitt (hired to play Ivan in a Hollywood movie), Billy Bragg, Jeremy Hardy, Manic Street Preachers, Bono and Nelson Mandela.
In the first episode of series three, Mr Drummond, the prison superintendent and Dobsky's chief caretaker, becomes enraged at factual inaccuracies pertaining to himself in the film version of Dobsky's life and joins Ivan and Mr Hoppy in a murderous rampage.
The Elderly Couple.
An elderly man and woman say goodnight to each other and turn out the lights. When they fall asleep, the man has dreams of an extremely homoerotic nature, containing obvious phallic symbolism and numerous homosexual stereotypes which greatly interest him. Upon waking up, his wife asks him if he had any nice dreams, to which he replies that he didn't really dream at all.
In the last episode featuring this couple, the woman has a similar dream, except involving woman bikers and a lesbian orgy. When they wake up, the man asks her if she had any nice dreams, to which she replies, "No, nothing special. Just the dykes again."
David Baddiel.
The famous comedian put upon to perform numerous tasks because, as a famous comedian he is just as qualified as a trained professional. Such tasks include rescuing a child trapped underneath the wheels of a car or piloting a space shuttle.
He is played by himself, and in real life is partner to Morwenna Banks who provides voices for several of the characters in the show.
Daisy Harris press conference.
A bumbling police force investigating a young girl's murder appear alongside her foster family in a seemingly endless series of televised press conferences, but are unable to spot her foster father's obvious guilt despite the foster mother's accusing glare and stern expression. The foster father bears a marked resemblance to serial killer Harold Shipman, who went undetected for years before being identified and convicted. The inept police officer in charge constantly stresses that they are looking for somebody with "evil staring eyes" and the word "chillingly" is overused when describing the murder. A young local man of simple intellect is eventually charged with the murder, despite possibly suspect evidence (a reference to the conviction of Barry George for the murder of Jill Dando - the fictional suspect uses the alias "Frank Sinatra", while George changed his name to Barry Bulsara and claimed to be related to Freddie Mercury). The sketch is partially inspired by the Sion Jenkins investigation.
Divorced dad (with Timmy).
Timmy usually lives with his mother and Roger, his mother's new boyfriend. Each week Timmy comes to visit his father but always just talks about what Roger has done for him. The dad doesn't feel that he can impress him and ends up committing suicide each episode. As he goes off to kill himself, Timmy, who in reality is deeply fond of his Dad, reveals the truth too late. Roger remains an unseen character until episode 4, when Timmy shows his father a photo of him – revealing that he looks like an older version of Timmy himself, complete with ginger hair. Realising the truth, Timmy's father decides "not" to kill himself but to be a good father to Timmy anyway. In the last episode featuring these characters (during series two), the divorced dad is enthusiastic about a forthcoming visit from Timmy because they have not seen each other since Timmy and his mother moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne several years previously, but on discovering that a now teenage Timmy has begun to dress, talk and act like a Geordie in order to fit in with the local kids, the father commits suicide for the final time out of sheer desperation. (This turns out to be Timmy just showing off, and in fact he longs for things to be how they used to be with his father — alas, too late, as always.)
The Cab Driver.
An immigrant taxi driver attempts to make conversation with his passenger, each time stating that in his country, he held a certain title. "In my Country, I am the inventor of the Hoover!" After saying this, the annoyed woman in the passenger seat states that she wanted to go to a normal location, and not the outrageous location he's driven to. (Narnia, Io, the third moon of Jupiter, The Triassic Era)
Chat room pervert.
A paedophile attempts to lure children via a chat room, but fails each time, unable to successfully portray himself as a 12-year-old boy named "Benji". Failures include correcting a child's grammar, inadvertently mentioning that he was in London while it was being bombed in World War II, and trying to get a photo of the girl to whom he's been chatting, but only getting a photo of her friend "Lucy", a guinea pig. When he eventually manages to arrange a meeting with one of his online friends known as "Charlotte", the "child" turns out to be another elderly chat room paedophile.
The pseudo-intellectuals.
A group of pseudo-intellectuals make increasingly pretentious statements about art, culture and life in general while waving their arms around earnestly. Examples include: "The nineties were to the eighties what the seventies were to the sixties" and "Serial killers are just rock stars without guitars". They are shown queueing outside a club or restaurant, a church, and even the house of one of their own mothers. Each time, they are turned away when they get to the front of the line due to a "No Wankers" policy. Later sketches saw other people responding to them with extreme violence before they can even get to the front of the queue: "Excuse me, I'm sorry, but I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying and I'm going to have to arrange to have you crushed to death by a grand piano." One of characters is referred to in the script notes by the moniker 'Scotch twat'.
Geoff the first-time cottager.
Geoff is a wimpy bespectacled office worker who constantly tries to pluck up the courage to fellate strange men in toilets or parks ("cottaging" is the slang term), but is always thwarted somehow, and when he finally succeeds with a fellow gay co-worker, he finds that he doesn't really like it (although they end up cuddling instead). In one scene, Geoff attends an evening class in for beginners at his local college, in which he enters the classroom proudly announcing to the class that he wants to be a cottager, only to be told that the class is for Bengali literature and that the class he is looking for is next door. When Geoff visits Rio de Janeiro for the Carnival, he attempts to perform fellatio on a man dressed as a traffic policeman. The man tells him in Portuguese that he really is a traffic cop (Geoff looks through his phrasebook) and beats him savagely. In another episode, he is prosecuted for false advertising under the Weights and Measures Act, for describing his penis as a 'Red Hot Quarter Pounder' on a toilet wall.
The yuppies.
A group of middle class friends who are constantly holding very dull dinner parties, until a bizarre or out of the ordinary event happens to liven it up (e.g. in one episode a guest suddenly suggests playing Russian roulette and in the next scene one of the guests has been shot in the head; in another a couple are talking about how they had children via IVF using eggs and sperm donated by athletes and geniuses, at which point the children come downstairs and cause their parents' heads to explode using the power of telekinesis (a homage to the films Village of the Damned and Scanners). If any of the guests takes issue with the innate horribleness of what they are doing, they usually buckle to peer pressure – even to the extent of taking the bullet in the Russian roulette scene, after it becomes apparent that the rest of the group has been cheating. In each scene, David Gray (or similar MOR UK artists) can be heard playing in the background.
Sven-Göran Eriksson.
A television shows a stock crowd scene from history or nature, for example, a herd of stampeding wildebeest or Indians bathing naked in the holy water of the Ganges, and a voice-over says 'And of course, no surprise to see manager of the English national football team Sven-Göran Eriksson in the crowd'; a reference to his ubiquitous appearances at football matches throughout England at the time.
The classically-trained actor.
A man named Guy who constantly speaks in the emotionless, non-committal style of a TV voice-over, including during sex, in the crowd at a football match, drunkenly admonishing other customers in a pub, when crying during a speech at a friend's funeral and other times when it is normal to talk in an emotional manner. His only friends are also voice over actors. One is a parody of the American gravelly voiced actor who voices over video trailers (Bill) whilst another speaks in the style of a 'consolidate your finances with one loan adverts' actor's voice. Everyone else who hears him, especially his wife, notice nothing wrong in his speech. Whenever slighted, he notes that he is a classically-trained actor but he can only ever get television voice-over work. The voice of the "classically-trained actor" is voiced by a real life voice-over artist, Peter Dickson whose voice has been used on such shows as ""Today With Des and Mel", "The Price is Right", "The Paul O'Grady Show"" and many others
. The other voice-over actors are played by Enn Reitel (consolidation adverts man whose voice is used by Lombard Direct) and others.
Theme pub.
A cardigan-wearing man named Brian walks into his local pub, called "Jefferie's", which, although he is the only patron, has on each occasion been transformed by orders of "the brewery", seemingly as an attempt to attract more customers. Themes include a Crack House and an S&M bar. On one occasion, he enters the pub to be told by a barman named Keith, in an absurd leprechaun outfit that it is now an "Oirish pub". When he asks what happened to the previous barman, who was Irish, he is told that he wasn't "Oirish" enough. Despite the several themes, Brian remains the only patron, and only ever drinks a pint of Best, with cheese and onion crisps. In the last episode, the brewery decide the problem with the pub is Brian himself, and ban him. As he walks past the pub, a large queue has formed, showing how successful the pub is, now that people don't see Brian alone inside it.
Kelly, work experience girl.
A very dim teenage girl with no understanding of office work, she says "I'm Kelly, I'm on work experience" whenever approached. She is totally inept: if you ask her to file some papers, she might photocopy a kettle or staple a mousemat to her foot. In her final scene she jumps out of a window and dies, much to the joy of her employer.
Movie parodies.
Several movie parodies are featured in the first and subsequent series. These typically satirise big-budget Hollywood tendencies, particularly:
Examples include:
Series two.
People on the Toilet.
Proposed by the television controller at the beginning of season 2, "People on the Toilet" is a reality TV show frequently seen or referred to throughout season 2, in which cameras film contestants sitting on the toilet 24 hours a day. Elaine, being the most popular (and seemingly only) contestant quickly becomes a huge, almost god-like media celebrity, being bestowed such honours as carrying the Olympic torch on the final leg of its journey (Her exploits are often heard on the news during Clive Pringle's walk home) The show achieved viewing figures of 120 million, meaning the entire population of the UK watched it twice. Abdul and Shafiq also mention a celebrity version featuring Su Pollard.
Jon Swoon.
TV presenter/lawyer who tries to have Ivan Dobsky released from prison (while mentioning his own name at every possible opportunity). He ends up murdered by Dobsky's security robotic arm. Hosts a programme called "Beyond Reasonable Doubt" and sets about proving that Dobsky could not possibly have committed the Meatsafe murders because of the length of time it would have taken him to travel from where he was last seen to the crime scene by spacehopper. The character appears to be a satire of channel 4 newsreader Jon Snow.
Omar, Abdul and Shafiq, the incompetent terrorists.
Omar, a former privileged public schoolboy, is a fanatical Islamist and a member of a terrorist organisation he calls 'The International Revolutionary Jihad for the Liberation of the Islamic Republic of Great Britain'. His cell is based in West Bromwich in the West Midlands in the UK and is bent on "unleashing a reign of terror the like of which the world has only dreamed about in its foulest nightmares." Omar has recruited two teenage boys, Abdul and Shafiq, to carry out suicide bombings in the name of Allah - but through various comical misadventures, their plans always fail.
The effectiveness of their terror campaign is somewhat undermined by the fact that Abdul and Shafiq seem to take their jihad for granted and treat it with the same offhandedness as the mundane details of their daily lives such as sport (their beloved West Bromwich Albion F.C.) and television (shows such as Room 101 and Celebrity Stars in Their Eyes), and also because Abdul and Shafiq (and Omar to a lesser degree) are so very much a part of the Western culture and lifestyle they are attempting to defeat. Omar suffers much of this, but often reveals he too finds the fate of West Bromwich Albion F.C. to be just as serious a matter as the liberation of anyone, and just as likely to dictate when and how his terrorist attacks take place – usually in order to avoid missing a game. As the series progressed, it became more and more apparent that Omar was just as immature and insincere in his hatred for the west as his two underlings, and this was highlighted by the introduction of one of his superiors in a later episode (during which the instruction to "come under cover of darkness" was misinterpreted, resulting in the IRJLIRGB arriving dressed as the British rock group "The Darkness").
It is possible the inspiration for this depiction of radical Islamicist ideology in the midst of otherwise normal modern British life comes from the detention of the so-called Tipton Three at Camp X-Ray. In Monkey Dust's sketches, Omar the ringleader is said to come from Tipton, where the jihad is taken "dead serious".
There are similarities between this sketch and the film Four Lions.
Abu the illegal immigrant.
An illegal immigrant who is never able to see the bad side of living in Britain, and remains eternally optimistic however dire his situation becomes. He often writes gushing letters to his family in India about how wonderful his new life in Britain is (despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary), and even chooses a strip club as the ideal place to look for a girlfriend. He quickly gets promoted in his new job from doormat to curtain.
Essex man and London man.
Two large, bald, essentially identical, men discuss the relative merits of Essex and London, usually on a topical theme (ie. where the next James Bond should come from, or where the best women can be found). This usually escalates to them yelling "ESSEX!" and "LONDON!" at each other. This references the way that, to the rest of the country, Essex and London are considered merely as contiguous parts of a whole. In one episode, a Madrid-Barcelona equivalent featured, wearing football shirts and Spanish moustaches. The later skits culminate by revealing them to be in an intimate relationship of implied homosexual nature.
"Your hair looks nice".
A woman is having her hair done. Her boyfriend tries to remember to compliment her on her new style, but is always distracted by some extraordinary event, such as an alien invasion, the arrival of James Bond or even the Second Coming of Jesus. By the time his girlfriend arrives, all evidence of the strange event has disappeared, and she thinks her speechless boyfriend just doesn't care.
The Paedofinder General.
Inspired by the film "Witchfinder General". An ominous, imposing character who executes alleged paedophiles on dubious evidence, parodying the hysterical waves of moral panic over the issue of paedophilia that swept Britain at the time (largely driven by the tabloid media), leading to certain individuals being demonised for little or no reason. Examples include a quiz show host seeking the correct answer of "P.D. James", a public swimming pool attendant whose Speedo trunks are mis-read as "Peedo", and the cast of a production of "Fiddler On The Roof" because he thinks it has something to do with "kiddie fiddling". When executing suspected paedophiles, he will cite justification with the likes of, "By the power vested in me by a text vote on Sky News...", "by a bloke I met down the pub, who said he knew it for definite...", or "By prurient wishful thinking... I proclaim you guilty of paedophilia!" He is seen looking at online child pornography himself, but claims that it's "for research" (possibly a reference to the reason used by Pete Townshend when he was caught entering a chargeable child porn website). The Paedofinder General appeared in a few skits in the first episode of series two and returned as a regular character in series three. In the third series, the Paedofinder General has a musical number, singing along with some of his cohorts. The song is "Fire" by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (albeit with slightly changed lyrics)
Mail-order bride man.
A grotesquely fat middle-aged man with a quiff, sideburns, poor personal hygiene and a penchant for Andy McNab books and REO Speedwagon, greets his Thai mail-order bride who turns out to be beautiful, intelligent, adoring of him and completely impervious to his disgusting lifestyle. Each episode, when he expects sex and she declines because she wants their love to grow stronger by waiting, he kicks her out.
In his final appearance, the man orders a mail order bride that is clearly a man. But despite the bad looks, rude attitude and general nastiness of the mail order bride, the man is happy because his bride offers him a 'bunk up', even though it cost him £50.
Nazi grandfather.
An apparently kind and elderly man who is a former high-ranking member of the Nazi party and was almost certainly active in their numerous war crimes. Before going to formal events (his granddaughter's wedding, a court hearing), he is told to wear something "smart" for the occasion, but finds he has nothing "smart" left to wear except his Nazi SS dress uniform jacket, complete with swastika armband and SS-Totenkopfverbande cap badge, inevitably leading to trouble. On one occasion he is admitted into a nursing home, but has to leave when the other elderly people realise he is "Die (sic) Weiße Engel" - a reference to a scene in the movie "Marathon Man" and to Dr Josef Mengele, latterly of Auschwitz.
Alex, the Relationship-seeking girl.
A girl at a club with her friends, looking for love, walks over to a man, and asks his name. As soon as he says his name, she is star-struck and starts dreaming of the future. She imagines first a series of romantic events (candle-lit dinner, a tropical resort holiday, a wedding) followed by a disastrous event to end their relationship (man cheating on her, man dressing up in her clothes, man flopping in bed.) She then storms off within seconds, usually after throwing a drink over him or slapping him in the face, before heading back to her friends, where she tells them what a wanker he was, and they all commiserate, "Ugh, men!"
Gambling-addicted dad.
A father of a young girl is hopelessly addicted to gambling and resorts to selling her possessions and birthday presents received from her family to fund his habit. Despite this, the girl shows undying admiration and compassion for her father, often replying "I don't mind if it's going to help you get better". Having pawned off her last remaining possessions, Dad has a dream where he resorts to selling one of her kidneys and part of her liver, despite ex-footballer, Tony Adams's words of wisdom. The ever-supportive daughter subsequently suggests "I could probably make do with one lung."
Series three.
Fran Chappell.
An ordinary mother who uses her daughter's disappearance and the ongoing police investigation as the springboard to launch a showbiz career. She appears on TV, releases a single and much more. The girl, Rebecca Chappell, eventually comes back and Fran gives her £100 and tells her to go away. Rebecca launches her own highly successful career, while her mother's fifteen minutes of fame are ending disastrously (resulting in a naked Fran begging outside the TV studios: "Gissa job! I'll do anything! Lezza stuff, barnyard sex, anal, "Ready Steady Cook", anything!").
Noodles.
Designed by Paul Donnellon the character draws inspiration from the characters of Tex Avery, such as "Bugs Bunny". Noodles is a laboratory rabbit who can survive all manner of horrific medical experiments because he is only a toon. The sketch begins with Matt Harding's haunting "Our Conversation" playing in the background, as a doctor and another researcher discuss the problems related to a disease or over-exposure to a specific drug. In the final episode he turns the tables on the researchers by dropping an anvil on their heads in true cartoon fashion. Only of course for the human doctor, this is fatal and extremely bloody.
Broody woman.
A woman in denial that she wants a child despite evidence to the contrary, such as dressing kittens in baby clothes and pushing them around in a pram. In a final scene she is seen to kidnap a man, tie him up and use a breast pump on his genitals to quite literally "milk him" for her use.
Prime Minister.
A caricature of Tony Blair who makes a speech (later in front of an American flag to satirise his overtly US-friendly outlook), making repeated ludicrous promises such as "Magic beans for every household," with the odd realistic promise like "Post to be delivered on time" or "houses that people can actually afford" included, with the implication that they too are just as unlikely to be delivered. One of the promises made, that pubs would be open after 11pm, did actually happen.
Saint Stephen's Hospital.
A very badly run hospital highlighting all the main criticisms about the British National Health Service. Its many problems include a "superbug" that can be seen visibly travelling along the corridors, patients transported in a supermarket trolley, ants invading, organs stolen from recently deceased patients, a bereavement counsellor turning up before the patient has died, but promising to return in '15 minutes' and an ultrasound scan of a pregnant woman that reveals that her baby is spraying graffiti in the womb.
Middle-Aged Couple.
A middle aged husband and wife are constantly interrupted by the noise outside their homely and comfortable flat. The wife wearily states "I bet it's those 'kids from the estate'". Her husband replies after peeking through the curtains, "yes... it's the kids from the estate again!", who are then shown performing untraditional 'trouble-making' acts such as disproving the theory of gravity, coaxing Vin Diesel to fight a bear, performing handbrake turns on a giraffe and enlarging the EU.

Kystlink

Nye Kystlink AS, trading as kystlink, was a Norwegian ferry shipping company that operates between Langesund in Norway and Strömstad, Sweden and Hirtshals, Denmark. The company was wholly owned by Taubåtkompaniet, owned by Ole T. Bjørnevik, and operated one cruiseferry, MS "Kongshavn". It ceased operations on 21 October 2008.
The company was established in 2006, following the bankruptcy of Kystlink AS. The company acquired MS "Pride of Telemark", but the ship had an accident on 11 September 2007, and was for the rest of the company's history in dry dock. After this, Kystlink acquired MS "Fantaasia" from Estonian Tallink, changing the name to "Kongshavn". The ship was described by Håkan Ågård in the Swedish Maritime Administration as the worst he had ever seen, with severe lacks to maintenance, though pointed out the responsibility was that of Tallink and not Kystlink. This point of view had protested by the Estonian Maritime Administration and in July 2008 supported by Paris MOU.
On October 20, 2008, the company announced that its ferry service would conclude on October 21, and the company would be liquidated.

Mount Chigogabaka

Outline and History.
Mount Chigogabaka is the tallest mountain of Tanjō Mountains, which itself is a part of Rokkō Mountains. The name ‘Chigogabaka’ literally means ‘a tomb of Children’. Actually there is a tomb of children just near the top of this mountain. These children were said to be killed by soldiers of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who was under control of Oda Nobunaga around 1580. At the time there is an influential Buddhist temple called Myōyōji, on the top of Mount Tanjō, and the temple was on the side of Bessho Nagaharu in Miki Castle, when Hideyoshi attacked Nagaharu. Hideyoshi burned the temple and killed many monks and their families brutally. The people around the temple pitied the victims and especially the children and made their tomb on the top of this mountain.

In the early morning hours of the 24th, Ostermann-Tolstoy ordered a retreat. The fighting caused about 1,400 casualties on each side.

Szczypiorno

Szczypiorno is a municipal neighbourhood of the city of Kalisz, Poland. Formerly until 1976 a separate village at the outskirts of the city, it is best known as a seat of a World War I and Polish-Bolshevist War prisoner of war camp and the name-sake for "szczypiorniak", the Polish language name for the game of handball. 
The borough is located along the National Road 25 linking Kalisz with Ostrów Wielkopolski. There is a Kalisz Szczypiorno railway station located in the neighbourhood. During World War I the village housed a German-built prisoner of war camp for soldiers of the Polish Legions following their internment in the aftermath of the so-called Oath crisis. It was there that the internees first started playing a game of handball, that later became popular with the reborn Polish Army and general population. Because of that the game is still commonly referred to as "szczypiorniak" in Polish. 
After World War I the camp remained operational for internees from Germany and Bolshevist Russia. Disbanded some time in early 1920s, it was turned into a Central School of Prison Service, still operational. During World War II the village was occupied by Nazi Germany and renamed, first to "Friedersbrunn" and then to "Deutschehren"
In 1976 the village was incorporated into the city of Kalisz.

Armoured regiment (United Kingdom)

The Type 58 and 44 armoured regiments are two organisations currently provided by the Royal Armoured Corps of the British Army. They are a battalion-sized formations equipped with Challenger 2 main battle tanks. As the likelihood of a major Cold War confrontation died down, and the Army has been deployed to lower-intensity conflicts, the role of heavy armour has become less well-defined, focusing more on infantry co-operation and support rather than pure armoured conflict.
Current use as of the 2003 Defence Review.
Following the 2003 Defence Review, five regular army regiments are equipped for the heavy armoured role: Of the five regiments, two are currently assigned to 1st (UK) Armoured Division (The Queen's Royal Hussars and The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards) and three to 3rd (UK) Mechanised Division (The Royal Dragoon Guards, 2nd Royal Tank Regiment and The King's Royal Hussars).
Type 58 armoured regiments;
Heavy armoured regiments;
Two regiments of the Territorial Army, the Royal Wessex Yeomanry and the Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry, provide replacement crews for the regular regiments.
The 1st Royal Tank Regiment also operates a small number of Challenger 2 tanks for training and demonstration. That role has since ended with the move towards Army 2020.
Organisation.
The basic combat organisation of an armoured regiment is four armoured squadrons (or "Sabre squadrons"), each of four troops of three Challenger 2 tanks. The squadron headquarters has two tanks, for a total of fourteen per squadron, along with a Spartan APC and a utility truck; each squadron also has a medical detachment with a Samaritan ambulance and a fitter section with various recovery vehicles. The regimental headquarters has a further two Challenger 2 tanks, for a total of fifty-eight in the regiment, as well as five Sultan command vehicles and a small group of utility vehicles. In addition to this, each armoured regiment has a reconnaissance squadron with eight Scimitars.
Of the five armoured regiments, two have the full four-squadrons structure, whilst three have the fourth squadron replaced by one equipped with an Interim Medium Armour Squadron, equipped with twelve Scimitars. 
History.
The first armoured regiments - known at the time as "tank battalions" - were formed in the First World War, first in the Machine Gun Corps and later as the Tank Corps. Each battalion had three companies, each of three sections of four tanks, for a combat strength of thirty-six tanks; a further twelve were kept in reserve for training and replacement purposes. A total of twenty-six battalions were formed during the war, quickly reduced to four battalions after the end of hostilities.
By the late Second World War there were four armoured regiments in each armoured division. While three of the regiments were equipped with the Sherman medium tank, the Reconnaissance Regiment of the division was equipped with the Cromwell tank. As they became available Sherman Firefly tanks replaced one regular Sherman in each troop, and then later a second would be replaced.
Each regiment was formed of four squadrons, A, B, C and HQ. The lettered squadrons were made up of four troops of four tanks and an HQ troop. The HQ squadron was made up of command tanks and a reconnaissance troop of light tanks. In north-west Europe, during the battle of Normandy from June to August 1944, anti-aircraft tanks were part of the HQ squadron.
The 1998 Strategic Defence Review cut the number of armoured regiments to six, converting one of the existing regiments to the formation reconnaissance role and using the other to form the Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiation and Nuclear Regiment. As a part of this change, the six remaining regiments were expanded from a three-squadron structure with 38 tanks to a four-squadron one with 58. This structure is also known as the "Type 58" regiment. Under the 2003 Defence White Paper, this was reduced to five armoured regiments - the sixth converting to the formation reconnaissance role - with three armoured squadrons to be converted to "light armoured" squadrons which would eventually be equipped with the Future Rapid Effect System.
Future.
In the future, the size of the Armoured Regiments will be reduced to a Type 56 Armoured Regiment. Only three regiments will be armed with the Challenger 2 tank.
The organisation of a Type 56 Armoured Regiment is:

Free Evangelical Churches

Free Evangelical Churches is a communion of over 60 regional Evangelical free churches in Greece. The great majority of the churches have the name "Free Evangelical Church". Free Evangelical Churches can be classified among the Baptist and the Plymouth Brethren churches. There are also 3 Greek Free Evangelical Churches in Australia and 2 in Canada.
History.
The Free Evangelical Church was founded from a conjunction of various Protestant churches in Greece. This effort was begun in 1886 in Chania, Crete by two English women who worked in the UK Consulate of Chania. At the same time in Athens the Church of Christian Brethren was founded by the Irish Henry Devine. A second church was created in Patras by Theofanis Zaferopoulos, which got help from Swiss Open Brethren. In 1911 Athanasios Katsarkas founded churches in Komotini and Andrianoupolis, while in 1914 they were transported to Thessalonica, and afterwards they also expanded into other regions. In Athens the main worker of the Free Evangelical Church was Kostas Metallinos. It is believed that Kostas Metallinos was the main founder of the Communion.
