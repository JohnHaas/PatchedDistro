Sparkling Generation Valkyrie Yuuki

Sparkling Generation Valkyrie Yuuki is a webcomic by the artist Kittyhawk that began in 2002 and is a member of the "Create a Comic Project". The series features a magical girl scenario and transgender issues. The series won a Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards in 2004 for "Best Superhero Comic" and was nominated again in 2006. 
Plot.
The comic's plot largely parodies the tropes seen in magical girl series and follows male high school Kanazuchi Yuuki, who has been chosen by an animal mentor to be the next Valkyrie. Valkyries in the webcomic are superheroes with little connection to the mythological entities and are always female. Yuuki is transformed before the mentor notices that he is male, which is a source of consternation and humor through the series.
Creator.
"Sparkling Generation Valkyrie Yuuki" has been drawn by Kittyhawk, who had previously worked on the webcomic "The Jar". The artist has stated that her influences include Tex Avery and CLAMP, as well as her childhood in Japan. Kittyhawk has worked on several different webcomic series, including The Dragon Doctors, Itari Party!, Quickies! and Model.
Kittyhawk currently works as a graphic designer and lives in the Southern United States with her husband.

He started as a History teacher before becoming the school's Admissions Director, later its Assistant Headmaster, Upper Division Head, and then the school's Operations Administrator while continuing to teach History.
Buy Me That Series.
Jim Fyfe starred as himself in the "Buy Me That!" series. The videos can be found on YouTube. Each one teaches the child audience about commercials, and if you can trust them or not.
Buy Me That.
The first video talks about toy commercials. What you see isn't what you get.
For example, a GIJoe plastic toy cannot fly, but the commercial shows you that it can. It turns out, they string the toy with a motor to make it appear as if it's spinning, then they take a stick and maneuver the helicopter around.
The sounds are also fake. During a commercial for potato chips, the sound crew tears up cardboard to make it sound loud, crunchy, and delicious. For a commercial for fake plastic swords, they remove the original "boring" sound, and replace it with real metal swords clashing with each other on the right timing. 
Buy Me That 2.
This video talks about food commercials.
Is Coca-Cola actually the same as Pepsi? This video hosts a contest to decide. They tested 70 kids, 35 Coca-Cola fans, 35 Pepsi fans. They filled one cup with Coca-Cola, one cup Pepsi, and one cup neither, but similar taste, and one cup water to clear up the previous taste so that the contestants can focus. The kids did not know which cup was which, except for the water. They then had to guess which one was their favorite beverage. In the end, the results was that there was no difference at all.
Another one is "Which orange juice can you trust?". You need to be careful what you read. Look for %100 Orange Juice on the label. If it doesn't say that, don't buy it.
The first few ingredients are the main ones. If the first few ends with "ose", it has a lot of sugar. You can go without cereal for breakfast.
Sometimes, food companies will pay movies and games to secretly advertise.

<doc id="20060620" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20060620" title="Le Pays">
Le Pays

Le Pays (The Land) is a three act opera by Guy Ropartz with a libretto by Charles Le Goffic. It was composed between 1908 and 1910 and was premiered in 1912 at Nancy. It is an important example of the Breton cultural renaissance of the early 20th century.
Origins.
Libretto.
Ropartz stated that he was looking for an opera subject that involved "interiorised action; few events; feelings; few characters; no spectacle." He was given a copy of Le Goffic's short story collection "Passions Celtes" (1908), and was immediately attracted to the story "L'islandaise" (The Icelandic Girl), which describes a doomed love affair between the girl and a stranded Breton fisherman. It was based on the lives of the Breton "Icelanders", who fished in Icelandic waters and sometimes stayed there for periods. Ropartz had already created a score for Louis Tiercelin's stage adaptation of Pierre Loti's novel "Pêcheur d'Islande" (An Iceland Fisherman) on the same basic theme. Ropartz asked Le Goffic to adapt his story for the stage.
Music.
Ropartz's style is influenced by the form of Wagner's music dramas and the structural innovations of César Franck. Ropartz makes frequent use of leitmotives and also incorporates elements of Breton folk melodies to represent the hero's nostagia for his homeland. The critic Michel Fleury argues that the music is built around four main themes, one of which represents Iceland, and in particular the bog which plays a role in the narrative; one represents the main female character and the emotion of love associated with her; another represents the male character and his nostalia for Brittany. The fourth theme represents stability, associated with the heroine's father.
Synopsis.
Act I. 
"Autumn: A cottage in Iceland": Tual, a Breton fisherman who has survived a shipwreck, has been recuperating in the home of Jörgen, an old trapper. He is tended by Kaethe, Jörgen's daughter. She suggests that Tual must be nostalgic for his Breton home. Tual reminds her that after he had dragged himself ashore from the shipwreck, he nearly died in the "Hrafuaga", a dangerous Icelandic swamp; only Jörgen's timely arrival saved him. All the other fishermen on the ship were drowned, so everyone in Brittany will think him dead and he has no ties there anymore. Tual declares his love for Kaethe. Kaethe is worried that Tual's feelings may be temporary, but says she loves him too. In the absence of a preacher Jörgen "marries" the couple by insisting that Tual dedicate himself to Kaethe by swearing on the "mud of "Hrafuaga"" that if he ever abandons her it will swallow him up.
Act 2
"Spring: The Icelandic shore": Tual dreams of Paimpol, his home in Brittany, while making a small fishing boat. He sings Breton folk songs. Kaethe says she has seen a sadness in him for his homeland and worries that he will sail back to Brittany. Tual says his boat is too small for anything more than local waters. Kaethe tells him she is pregnant with his child, hoping that this will keep him beside her. Kaethe sings him a Nordic ballad about "Sir Olaf", who was abducted by the Queen of the Fairies. His loyal wife Lady Hilda waited for him for a hundred years, so that they could renew their love and die together. Tual says that they will live and die together like Olaf and Hilda.
Act 3
"Spring: The cottage": Kathe muses on Tual's increasingly withdrawn behaviour. Jörgen returns home tipsy after drinking gin and reminisces about Kaethe's late mother, describing how they grew up together. When Tual enters Jörgen mentions that some Paimpol fishermen have arrived at the village of Seidsfjord. Tual is excited and asks if it is easy to get there. Jörgen says that if the "Hrafuaga" swamp is still frozen, it can be crossed in time to catch them. Tual tries to put the thought out of his mind, but as he sleeps with Kaethe he has a dream of Brittany. In his vision he sees the rolling Breton landscape and the white sails of the Paimpol fishing fleet. He leaves and tries to cross the "Hrafuaga". Kaethe watches as the swamp cracks and swallows him.

Confederate Monument in Murray

The Confederate Monument in Murray is a historic statue located in the northeast corner of the Calloway County Courthouse in Murray, Kentucky.
The fountain was funded after three years by the J. N. Williams Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1917, whose chairman died during that period; her name was placed upon the monument in tribute. The U.D.C. paid $2,500 to Marietta, Georgia's McNeel Monument Company for the monument.
The monument has three parts. The bottom is a porcelain drinking fountain; when it was a working fountain, a step pedal was used to obtain water. It was by far the most elaborate and modern of the Civil War fountain monuments. (The other three fountains are the Confederate Memorial in Mayfield, Confederate Memorial Fountain in Hopkinsville, and the Confederate Monument of Cadiz.) Four Doric columns support a granite canopy. Inside the canopy is an ornate iron light fixture with four incandescent bulbs to light the fountain. On top are four marble balls and a marble statue of Robert E. Lee, making it the only monument in Kentucky that heavily features Robert E. Lee; the only other monument in Kentucky with a likeness of Lee is Bardstown, Kentucky's Confederate Monument of Bardstown which has only a small relief portrait of Lee below the large statue of a Confederate soldier.
During the war, Murray/Calloway County saw 800 of its citizens serve in the Confederate Army, as opposed to 200 who served in the Union Army.
On July 17, 1997, the Confederate Monument in Murray was one of sixty-one different monuments related to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission.

Confederate Monument in Owensboro

The Confederate Monument in Owensboro is a historic statue located at the southwest corner of the Daviess County Courthouse lawn in Owensboro, Kentucky.
The Monument was placed on the courthouse lawn in September 1900 by the John C. Breckinridge Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, after several years of fund raising. Over 5,000 came to witness the dedication, which included speeches and music. Among the dignitaries was the editor of "The Confederate Veteran", S. A. Cunningham.
The monument consists of two parts. The granite base is nine feet tall, and has carved upon it a wreath encircling the original Confederate flag. The statue depicts a Confederate soldier on alert bearing a rifle and wearing a short jacket and slouch hat. It is seven feet tall and made of bronze. It was made at the John Williams Bronze Foundry in New York, and was sculpted by the Romanian-American "sculptor of the Confederacy" George Julian Zolnay.
In the summer of 1861, one of Kentucky's first Confederate companies was raised at Owensboro. The war hurt the city, as it disrupted river traffic that the city relied upon, and Confederate forces occasionally raided the city, including burning the courthouse. A historical marker near the monument tells of three residents of Daviess County that received the Confederate Medal of Honour; one at the Battle of Murfreesboro, and two for the Battle of Chickamauga.
On July 17, 1997, the Confederate Monument in Owensboro was one of sixty-one different monuments related to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission. The only other monument on the list in Daviess County is the Thompson and Powell Martyrs Monument.

<doc id="20060798" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20060798" title="Hooman Majd">
Hooman Majd

Hooman Majd, born 1957 in Tehran, is an Iranian-American journalist, author, and commentator who writes on Iranian affairs. He is based in New York City and regularly travels to Iran.
Early life.
Majd's maternal grandfather was the Ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Assar (1885-1975), who was born to an Iraqi mother and an Iranian father. The Ayatollah, along with other contemporary ulema, overcame traditional opposition to serve as a professor of philosophy at the University of Tehran. His own father, whose origins were in the village of Ardakan, Iran, became representative of a "middle class" that was "pro-democratic and pro-modernization".
Raised in a family involved in the diplomatic service, Majd lived from infancy abroad, mostly in the US and in England but attending American schools in varied places, such as Tunis and New Delhi. He boarded at St Paul's School in London, England and attended George Washington University in Washington, D.C. He stayed in the US after the 1979 revolution and finished his college education in the US.
Career.
He has published three non-fiction books, in the U.S., the U.K. and which have been translated into a number of other languages :
He has also published short fiction in collections and in The American Scholar and Guernica.
Majd has also served as an advisor and translator for President Mohammad Khatami and translator for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on their trips to the United States and the United Nations, and has written about those experiences.
Views.
Roland Elliott Brown writes in the British newspaper "The Observer" that "Majd's mild reformist agenda requires him to fight on two fronts" and that he has "honed his polemical skills by defending the nascent Islamic Republic to Iranian emigres at Speakers’ Corner in London." adding that, in his opinion, Majd is "a sometimes sympathetic communicator of the regime's positions, and an enthusiast only for its most loyal oppositionists". Reviewing Majd's book "The Ayatollahs' Democracy", Brown observes that Majd regards the administration as "increasingly fascistic": "flawed, capricious, but also popular, and a bulwark of sovereignty".
According to "Newsweek", "Majd's Iran is a land where ayatollahs criticize each other and young people flout rules about wearing chadors. It's a land where Majd—who makes no secret of his admiration for the reformist President Mohammad Khatami—could go on to serve as the official translator for Khatami's successor and archrival, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, when the latter visited New York in September. But Majd is no Iran apologist: he ridicules Ahmadinejad's officials for their Holocaust deniers' conference in 2006. Majd's subtle central point is that "the lack of meaningful relations between Iran and the United States … has brought little advantage to either nation."
Following the 2009 election in Iran, which he "concedes [. . .] fielded only regime-vetted candidates and was stolen", Majd continues to enjoy access to its politicians and officials, especially to former President Khatami. Admittedlly "emotionally invested in the politics of the country", a stated goal of Majd's is to shed light on the elusive "truth about Iran" that is fair for all of its people.
Twitter controversies.
In July 2012 a tweet from Majd's Twitter account was made about Iranian-born Nazanin Afshin-Jam, a human rights advocate and the wife of Canadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay.
The tweet read: "Fucking a Canadian minister doesn’t make you Canadian, azizam. Come back to papa …" Majd has denied making it, and in a later public tweet directed at Afshin-Jam Majd said his account had been hacked: "@NazaninAJ A recent series of tweets were made in my name as a result of a hack. Not my words, and tweets have been removed." Before the tweet Afshin-Jam had been calling on the Canadian government and the Canadian Assembly of First Nations to cut diplomatic ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Afshin-Jam described the matter as serious but added that "unless I can verify exactly who sent it, I can’t really comment."
In October 2013, Majd referred to Iranian-American "Wall Street Journal" (WSJ) assistant books editor Sohrab Ahmari as "WSJ's (Iranian) 'House Negro'" in a post on Twitter. Majd acknowledged the statement was insult, but said he stood by it.

Confederate Memorial in Fulton

The Confederate Memorial includes a Confederate soldier statue atop an arch anchored in the Fulton, Kentucky Fairview Cemetery. Funded in 1902 by the Colonel Ed Crossland Chapter No. 347 of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the historic monument is the only such monument in Kentucky to feature an arched base, made of rough-hewn limestone.
Details.
The arch is high. On the back of the arch it says "Erected by UDC 1902". The Confederate soldier statue atop the arch is more typical; it is made of zinc, and features a typical Confederate soldier wearing a slouch hat, carrying a canteen and bed roll while resting himself with his rifle. No other monument in Kentucky features a statue atop an arch, making Fulton's monument unique. Inside the arch are the names of the various officers of the Colonel Ed Crossland Chapter No. 347 of the UDC, which funded the monument. The remains of a walkway are on all four sides of the monument. Due to how late it was built, the monument was meant to celebrate the Confederacy, not to mourn it, despite being at the entrance to a cemetery; earlier such monuments in Kentucky had a "funeral" aspect. Behind the arch is a step with the initials UCV, the abbreviation for the United Confederate Veterans. The front step simply says "Confederate", and the side steps say nothing.
On July 17, 1997, it was one of sixty-one different monuments to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission. One other monument on the list is in Fulton County: the Confederate Memorial Gateway in Hickman, located to the west in Hickman, Kentucky.

Confederate Memorial Gateway in Hickman

The Confederate Memorial Gateway in Hickman, Kentucky is a historic cemetery gateway in Fulton County, Kentucky. It was funded in 1913 by the Private Robert Tyler Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
The Memorial Gateway was designed by Sir Moses Ezekiel, and built by the NcNeal Marble Company of Marietta, Georgia. It took ten years and $10,000 to construct the granite structure. The back is solid granite, but the front has ornamentation. The names of seventy Confederate soldiers are carved upon the hoods of the structure. It has a center opening for vehicles, and two side openings for pedestrian traffic. The inscription on its capstone reads: "1861 Our Heroes 1865". Due to its size and how long after the war it was built, it was meant more to celebrate the Confederate States of America instead of mourning it, even through it was built in a cemetery.
Due to its presence on the Mississippi River, Hickman was placed at a strategic point, and was held by both sides during the war. It was strongly pro-Confederate during the war, but after the Confederate lost control of the county in 1862, it would see occasional raids by Confederate cavalry.
On July 17, 1997, it was one of sixty-one different monuments to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission. The only other monument on the list that is a gateway is the Confederate Memorial Gates in Mayfield. One other monument on the list is in Fulton County: the Confederate Memorial in Fulton, located twenty miles to the east in Fulton, Kentucky.

James B. Christie House

The James B. Christie House is a large, flat-roofed Usonian on a beautiful wooded site in Bernardsville, New Jersey. The Christie House, built in 1940, is Frank Lloyd Wright's oldest and, at , Wright's largest house in New Jersey. The residence has one story and is made of brick, cypress, and redwood.
It is designed in an L-shaped plan with a rectangular living room and a dining area that is perpendicular to a wing with three bedrooms and three baths. The kitchen is in the corner of the L, like a hinge connecting the two sections, separating public from private areas. The flat roof with its overhanging soffit reinforces the sprawling horizontal design.
Wright advised James B. Christie, his first Jersey client, to select a setting that has "as much individuality as to topography and features—stream, trees, etc. and as much freedom from adjacent buildings as is possible."

Kangiryuarmiut

The Kangiryuarmiut (or Kanhiryuarmiut; or Kanhiryiirmiut) were a Copper Inuit subgroup. They were located on Victoria Island in the areas of Prince Albert Sound, Cape Baring, and central Victoria island. They were also found around Nelson Head on Banks Island. Kangiryuarmiut subsisted on bear. They were the only Copper Inuit who built "iglooit" on land. The Kangiryuarmiut speak the Kangiryuarmiutun subdialect of Inuinnaqtun dialect of Inuvialuktun language.
The Kangiryuarmiut and the Kangiryuatjagmiut of Minto Inlet were the northernmost Copper Inuit. They migrated seasonally in western Victoria Island, Banks Island, and the mainland around Kugluktuk, Nunavut. Prior to white contact, and prior to the introduction of schooners, they migrated usually by foot, developing what Nuttall referred to as an "embodied memoryscape", meaning that people knew place names along the route, the accompanying stories, and the collective significance with relational understanding of locations. According to Helen Balanoff from the NWT Literacy Council and Cynthia Chambers from the University of Lethbridge, this knowledge is integral to social identity and Inuinnaqtun literacy.

Erwin l'Ami

Erwin l'Ami (born 5 April 1985 in Woerden) is a Dutch chess grandmaster. He has emerged, along with Jan Smeets, Daniel Stellwagen and Jan Werle, as one of a new generation of talented young players from the Netherlands.
Early years.
He learned the game at the age of five, when his father introduced him to the moves and then took him to the local chess club. His new hobby quickly became a passion, but for a few years he remained just one of a crowd of promising juniors. Upon reaching the age of 12, his family relocated to a larger conurbation and the young l'Ami was exposed to a more testing level of competition, enabling his talent to be further developed.
Chess career.
At Gausdal in 2004, he won the tournament, ahead of Magnus Carlsen and despite being expected to finish no higher than mid-table. He soon fulfilled the requirements for an International Master title, awarded the same year. Becoming a full-time professional, the opportunities for travel continued to suit his lifestyle and in 2005, he complemented his training and dedication with a few good wins, gaining the necessary norms to be awarded the Grandmaster title. During this period, he finished second equal at the Essent tournament, was co-winner of the strong Karabakh 'B' tournament and scored well at the Wijk aan Zee Corus 'C' tourney, earning an upgrade to the 'B' tournament in 2006.
At the Turin 2006 Olympiad, he played a small but helpful role in the national team with a very respectable score of 3.5/5. By then, his Elo rating was reflecting the consistency in his performances and he passed the 2600 mark by the early part of 2007. Working with a new coach (GM Vladimir Chuchelov) was perhaps another reason for his continued progress. At the European Team Chess Championship at Heraklion in 2007, he contributed another plus score (4.5/8) to the Netherlands team total.
2008 was a rewarding year for l'Ami. He finished with a share of second place at the European Individual Championship in Plovdiv, missing out on the medals after an eight-way play-off. More recently, he took part in the EU Individual Open Chess Championship at Liverpool, maintaining touch with the leading group throughout and finishing with a share of fifth place, alongside compatriots Sergei Tiviakov and Jan Smeets.
He took part in the Chess World Cup 2009 and was knocked out by Krishnan Sasikiran in the first round.
L'Ami is renowned for his ability at rapid chess and even the more extreme forms of speed chess, where for example, each player has only 1 minute for the entire game. His handle on the Internet Chess Club is "Woef".
Chess second.
In 2008 l'Ami began working as a second to Ivan Cheparinov after the two had met at a tournament and become friends. Principally, he was engaged to assist Cheparinov at the elite Sofia M-Tel Masters event and benefited not only from the theoretical work they undertook together, but also from the insight he gained into chess at that level. In an interview given after the event, he considered the experience to be "inspirational". Along with Cheparinov and Francisco Vallejo Pons, he served as a second for Veselin Topalov in the February 2009 Challengers Match against Gata Kamsky.

Johan Erik Forsström (1775–1824) was a Swedish pastor and naturalist from the province of Dalarna. The plant genus "Forsstroemia" from the family Leptodontaceae is named after him.
He studied at the University of Uppsala, where one of his instructors was naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg (1743–1828). In 1800, he accompanied Göran Wahlenberg (1780–1851) on an expedition through Fennoscandia, where he performed entomological and botanical investigations. On the trip he maintained a journal, and in 1917 details of the expedition were published in a book titled "I Norrlandsstäder och Lapplandsbygd År 1800. John Erik Forsströms dagbok öfver resan i Norrland och Finnmarken 1800 och i Roslagen 1801". 
From 1802 until 1815, Forsström was assigned as pastor on Saint Barthélemy of the Leeward Islands, where he also worked collecting botanical specimens. Afterwards he returned to Sweden, where he died in 1824 at Munktrop, located near the town of Köping.

Whale Wars

Whale Wars is a weekly American documentary-style reality television series that premiered on November 7, 2008 on the Animal Planet cable channel. The program follows Paul Watson, founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, as he and the crew aboard their various vessels harass Japanese whalers off the coast of Antarctica. On December 13, 2013, Animal Planet aired the lone two-hour episode in the sixth season.
History.
In 2007, Discovery Channel began production of a reality show which would cover the activities of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's campaign against Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary off the coast of Antarctica. The Japanese claim that their whaling is legally research, which Sea Shepherd and others contend is a cover for banned commercial whaling. Sea Shepherd has been both criticized and praised for tactics of direct action sabotage which include throwing stink bombs of butyric acid, as well as ramming, boarding, and otherwise attempting to disable the Japanese vessels.
The program premiered on November 7, 2008, on the Animal Planet cable channel and follows events on the vessel as the group attempts to deter the hunting of Minke, Humpback and Fin whales in the Southern Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and North Atlantic. The show came at a time when Animal Planet was being re-branded to attract broader audiences and compete with non-animal-centric programming.
Synopsis.
Season one.
The 2007–08 Antarctic campaign was named Operation Migaloo, after the only known albino humpback in the world. This campaign was the focus of the first season of "Whale Wars", which premiered on November 7, 2008.
On January 15, 2008, after attempting to entangle the whaling vessel's propeller and throwing containers of butyric acid onto the decks, two Sea Shepherd members, Benjamin Potts and Giles Lane, from the Sea Shepherd vessel MV "Steve Irwin" boarded the Japanese whaling vessel "Yushin Maru No. 2" from a rigid-hulled inflatable boat. The pair were delivering a letter advising the Japanese that they were "whaling illegally" with the hope of creating an international incident. The Japanese responded by saying that the men would be held until Sea Shepherd stopped what they called "dangerous and illegal activities."
The crew of the "Yushin Maru No. 2" detained the men for two days, before turning them over to the Australian customs vessel MV "Oceanic Viking" on the orders of Japanese authorities; subsequently, the "Steve Irwin" rendezvoused with the "Oceanic Viking" and the two crew-members were returned to Sea Shepherd. On April 9, first mate Peter Brown was described in a newspaper article as saying that the incident only became a hostage situation because the Sea Shepherd vessel left the scene, so the Japanese would be forced to hold the two crewmen longer. He was quoted as saying, "It's all giant street theater."
On March 3, Sea Shepherd members threw bottles of butyric acid and packages of slippery methyl cellulose powder onto the Japanese vessel "Nisshin Maru". Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith condemned Sea Shepherd's actions for potentially causing injury The Japanese Government called in the Australian and Dutch ambassadors to protest the actions and urge those countries to prevent any violence. Watson said: "They are so full of crap. We filmed and photographed the entire thing. Not a single thing landed anywhere near their crew ... It is their way of trying to get sympathy."
The International Whaling Commission issued a statement on March 8, 2008 that "called upon the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society to refrain from dangerous actions that jeopardise safety at sea, and on vessels and crews concerned to exercise restraint." The statement also reiterated earlier IWC resolutions from May and July 2007 that read in part, "The commission and its contracting governments do not condone and in fact condemn any actions that are a risk to human life and property in relation to the activities of vessels at sea." The Australian Government also called for all parties to "exercise restraint" and "responsible behaviour" in the Southern Ocean.
On March 17, 2008 Paul Watson claimed that he was shot by the Japanese crew or coast guard personnel during the campaign. The incident is heavily documented during the show in the final episode, and the first six episodes are covered as a buildup to what is portrayed as the major incident during the campaign. The footage in "Whale Wars" shows Watson standing on the deck of the "Steve Irwin" while Sea Shepherd crew throws glass bottles filled with butyric acid at the "Nisshin Maru" whaling vessel. The Japanese respond by throwing flashbang devices. Watson is then shown reaching inside his jacket and bullet-proof vest and remarking "I've been hit." Back inside the bridge of the Steve Irwin, a metal fragment is found inside the vest. The Institute of Cetacean Research has dismissed Sea Shepherd's statements as lies. The Institute and Coast Guard said that they used seven flashbang devices designed to flash and make noise in the air without causing harm. Neither of the two conflicting accounts have been independently verified. The Australian Foreign Affairs Department had condemned "actions by crew members of any vessel that cause injury". Two media releases were made on the same day from the office. One said that the Australian Embassy in Tokyo had been informed by the Japanese that the whalers had "fired warning shots" while the updated version used the phrase "'warning balls' – also known as 'flashbangs' – had been fired", and that no gunshots had occurred.
Season two.
The 2008/09 Antarctic campaign was named Operation Musashi after the 17th-century Japanese strategist Miyamoto Musashi. On December 4, 2008, actress Daryl Hannah joined Sea Shepherd's crew aboard the "Steve Irwin" to take part in this season's operation.
On February 6, 2009, Watson reported that the "Steve Irwin" had collided with the "Yushin Maru 2" as the "Steve Irwin" tried to block its attempt to prevent the transfer of a dead whale up the slipway of the factory ship "Nisshin Maru". As Watson explained the incident, "We were in the process of blocking the transfer from the "Yushin Maru 2" when the "Yushin Maru 1" moved directly in front of the bow to block us. I could not turn to starboard without hitting the "Yushin Maru 1". I tried to back down but the movement of the "Yushin Maru 2" made the collision unavoidable." The Japanese whalers blamed Sea Shepherd for the crash, characterizing the incident as a "deliberate ramming." The collision was filmed by cameramen for the "Whale Wars" reality series, and formed part of a multi-day conflict during which Sea Shepherd attempted to prevent the Japanese fleet from harpooning whales, respectively tried to block whales from being transferred to the factory ship for processing by blockading the Japanese' vessel's slipway. The Japanese made extensive use of LRADs to deter Sea Shepherd. They were also accused of aiming the device at the "Steve Irwin's" helicopter while in flight, something the group especially condemned, seeing that the helicopter was only engaged in filming, and could have crashed if the pilot had lost control.
Season three.
At the start of the campaign, Marjorie Kaplan, president and general manager of Animal Planet, said in a news release: "The issues surrounding whaling in the southern ocean are important and complex. The majesty of these beautiful creatures and the lengths to which the Sea Shepherds will go in order to prevent whaling has made "Whale Wars" intense and vital television." She also said that Japan had denied requests to film on their vessels.
In June 2009, Sea Shepherd announced its 2009/10 Antarctic campaign, called Operation Waltzing Matilda. The campaign would include the record-breaking "Earthrace" vessel, now renamed "Ady Gil" in honor of the benefactor who helped acquire the vessel for Sea Shepherd. The "Ady Gil" was a futuristic styled ship that held the world record for circumnavigation of the globe by a motorized vessel. The eco-friendly vessel usually ran on a low emission fuel "derived mainly from animal fat, soybeans or other forms of bio-diesel" but was forced by operational reasons to switch to petroleum diesel. Pete Bethune, the operator, said that an agreement was reached with Sea Shepherd for the boat to adopt a support role.
In December Paul Watson and his crew of 40 left with the "Steve Irwin" from Fremantle, Australia, and "Ady Gil" left from Hobart, Tasmania. It was well publicized that the Sea Shepherds had added more vessel firepower to keep up with the larger, faster and more numerous whaling vessels. What they kept secret, however, was that Bob Barker, famous for "The Price Is Right" and one of the best-known personalities in the world of animal activism, donated funds to purchase a third vessel to add to the Sea Shepherd's fleet. Ironically, the ship is a former Norwegian whaling vessel but has since been renamed and refitted. With a crew of 26 and led by Chuck Swift and first officer and "Whale Wars" veteran Peter Hammarstedt, the "Bob Barker" was docked off the coast of Africa on the island nation of the Republic of Mauritius, until it was ready to join its Sea Shepherd colleagues and engage in a surprise "engagement" to stop whaling.
Season four.
In season four, Sea Shepherd's "Operation No Compromise" started with the whaling season in early December 2010, and lasted through February 2011 at which point the Japanese ceased whaling operations. The episodes began airing on Animal Planet on June 3, 2011. The campaign included a new interceptor vessel joining the Sea Shepherd fleet – (or "Godzilla") – replacing the role of the "Ady Gil". Sea Shepherd pilot Chris Aultman also received a larger, faster, and longer range MD 500 5-seat helicopter to replace his previous aircraft, a 3-seat Sikorsky S-300.
Season five.
On December 27, 2011, Animal Planet renewed the series for a fifth season for the Antarctic / Southern Ocean campaign dubbed ""Operation Divine Wind"", which ran from December 16, 2011 to March 14, 2012. The campaign (Season 5) was televised in June 2012 on Animal Planet. It debuted on June 1, 2012 and was preceded by a one-hour documentary called "Whale Wars: Battle Scars" which highlighted the previous seasons and set the stage for the new season.
Season six.
On September 20, 2012 Paul Watson began marshaling resources for another campaign named 'Zero Tolerance', which was launched in November 2012 and lasted into March 2013. Airing of the proceedings of operation 'Zero Tolerance' for the sixth season of Whale Wars began in December 2013. The two-hour special will be the only episode for the sixth season.
Critical reception.
"Whale Wars" became a hit for the channel and has received mostly positive reviews. While discussing the high ratings, the president and general manager of Animal Planet said that the show was a "great example of where we wanted to go into competitive adult TV." Review aggregation site MetaCritic has scored "Whale Wars" 71 out of 100 based on 6 reviews. Neil Genzlinger of the "New York Times" wrote: ""Whale Wars" splashes across the increasingly exhausted genre of people-at-work reality series like icy seawater, jolting you awake with a frothy, briny burst of — well, you get the idea. This is one spunky show."
The show has also been criticized for being biased, and the Sea Shepherd crew has been ridiculed. Nancy Dewolf Smith of "The Wall Street Journal" wrote: "What is shocking at first is how unprepared most of these people are for their self-appointed mission as planet savers. Although the word "deadly" is used often to underscore the risks the crew face, alone out in the wild Antarctic seas – their own incompetence can seem the most frightening." The satirists of "South Park" spoofed the show and the Japanese whalers in the 11th episode of season 13, as "Whale Whores." When one of the "South Park" characters takes command of the ship, a fake news headline states: "Whale Wars Gets Better: Things Actually Happen!" David Hinckley of the New York "Daily News" wrote: "Because the cameras obviously operate from the conservation ship – named the Sea Shepherd and, for this voyage, also called the Steve Irwin – we get all the drama on this side and virtually none on the other." Marjorie Kaplan, president and general manager of Animal Planet, says that they have requested access to the Japanese ships for filming but have repeatedly been declined.
Spin-offs.
In March 2012, Animal Planet announced a five-part spin-off titled "Whale Wars: Viking Shores" which followed Sea Shepherd operations to stop traditional whaling in the Faroe Islands in a mission dubbed "Operation Ferocious Isles" by Sea Shepherd. The series premiered on April 27, 2012. It was preceded by a single-episode documentary called "Operation Bluefin" which followed Sea Shepherd as they attempted to intervene in what they claimed was illegal poaching of Atlantic bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean Sea during the Libyan civil war in 2011.
A second documentary, "Seal Wars", followed members of Sea Shepherd as they attempted to intervene against seal hunting activities on the beaches of Namibia. It aired on the evening of June 8, 2012 prior to the second episode in the fifth season of "Whale Wars".

Beyond the Game

Beyond the Game is a 2008 Dutch documentary film about the world of professional video gaming, most notably as related to the game "" featuring world champion players Chinese Xiaofeng Li (Sky), Dutch Manuel Schenkhuizen (Grubby) and Swede Fredrik Johansson (MaDFroG) prominently. It is directed by award winning Dutch documentary filmmaker Jos de Putter. Filming took place in China, France, The Netherlands, USA and Sweden. Languages spoken in the documentary include Dutch, English, French, Spanish, Swedish, Standard Chinese and Korean.
Beyond the Game is the motto of the World Cyber Games, considered the olympics of gaming, which is central to the documentary as the main characters compete to defend or regain the event's championship title at the global finals of the 2007 World Cyber Games in Seattle, Washington.
It has premiered at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in Pathé de Munt, and had the cinema premiere in Pathé Tuschinski, and has now been released in cinemas throughout The Netherlands.
Historical background.
In 2002 the videogame ' is released which sells millions of copies and quickly becomes a leading title in the world of competitive gaming (in 2003 an expansion on the game, ', is released).
A 17-year old Swede by the name of Fredrik Johansson devotes himself to this new sport and rises to become the runner-up of the 2003 Electronic Sports World Cup and becomes widely regarded as the strongest non-Asian player. He is subsequently invited to become a full-time professional gamer in Seoul, South Korea where competitive gaming is an advanced subculture and many players make a living playing games. During his eleven month stay there he wins the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational and is recognized as the world's most successful gamer. After his return to Sweden he becomes runner-up of the Electronic Sports World Cup again in 2004, but subsequently loses his motivation for the sport and qualifies for one more event in the 2004 World Cyber Games before retiring a few months later. There he is defeated prematurely and a new European star takes over from him as 16-year old Manuel Schenkhuizen wins the event.
Dutchman Schenkhuizen was staying in Seoul at the time and a few months after the event he returns home and remains a dominating player. During this period his in-game race of choice, Orc, is considered disadvantaged in competition but he nevertheless is successful, winning the 2005 Electronic Sports World Cup. He gains the nickname 'King of Orcs' in televised competition, similar to the nickname 'Terran Emperor' for twofold StarCraft world champion Lim Yo-Hwan (Boxer). He is considered a favorite to defend his World Cyber Games title at the 2005 global finals in Suntec City, Singapore and cement his name as the best player ever; but is defeated at the event by Dennis "Shortround-" Chan, a 22 year old in college semi retired pro gamer.
Throughout the next year both players are frequent participants in the same international competitions. Schenkhuizen is successful enough to be honored as the Player of the Year in all of competitive gaming like Johansson two years before him. The award most important to both players however is that of World Cyber Games champion as the two qualify for the 2006 global finals in Monza, Italy and meet in the quarter-finals. Winning a second title would mean inclusion in the World Cyber Games Hall of Fame for either of them. This clash is observed by documentary filmmaker Jos de Putter who senses the deep emotions involved in the encounter, not only by the players but also by the spectators.
Afterwards the filmmaker decides to follow both players on their way to their next World Cyber Games encounter, where one player will try to defend and the other to regain the World Cyber Games title, and portray this new world. To provide insight in the background of the gaming scene and the mind of competitors he also contacts Fredrik Johansson who is developing a new life in Sweden and is now regarded as a legend in the world of competitive gaming.

Expedition 25

Expedition 25 was the 25th long-duration mission to the International Space Station (ISS). Expedition 25 began with the Soyuz TMA-18 undocking on 25 September 2010. Three new crewmembers (Scott Kelly, Alexander Kaleri and Oleg Skripochka) arrived aboard the ISS October 2010 on Soyuz TMA-01M to join Douglas Wheelock, Fyodor Yurchikhin and Shannon Walker, and formed the full six member crew of Expedition 25. NASA astronaut Doug Wheelock accepted command of Expedition 25 on 22 September 2010, taking over from Russia's Aleksandr Skvortsov. The departure of Wheelock, Walker and Yurchikhin on 25 November 2010 marked the official end of Expedition 25.
During Expedition 25 Progress M-08M spacecraft visited the ISS. Progress M-08M docked with the space station on 30 October 2010 bringing 2.5 tons of cargo supplies. Space shuttle Discovery on STS-133 mission was scheduled to arrive at the ISS on 3 November 2010 but was re-scheduled for launch on 3 February 2011. The 10th anniversary of human life, work and research on the ISS fell during Expedition 25. On 2 November 2000, Expedition 1 Commander William Shepherd and Flight Engineers Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko became the first residents of the space station. Expedition 25 ended on 26 November.
Preflight preparations.
At the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Expedition 25 Soyuz Commander Alexander Kaleri, NASA Flight Engineer Scott Kelly and Russian Flight Engineer Oleg Skripochka participated in a variety of activities from 26 September to 4 October 2010 as they prepared for their launch on 8 October 2010 (7 October 2010 U.S. Eastern time) in their Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft to the International Space Station. The footage includes the crew's arrival in Baikonur, their suited and unsuited fit checks in their Soyuz spacecraft, the raising of flags outside their Cosmonaut Hotel crew quarters and other traditional activities. The Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft was mated to its booster in a processing facility for its rollout to the launch pad in Baikonur 5 October 2010.
The Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft and booster rocket were moved to Launch Complex 5 (Complex 17P32-5) at Baikonur Cosmodrome on a rail-car 5 October 2010 for final preparations prior to launch.
Experiments.
Russian Federal Space Agency revealed that during Expedition 25 and 26, 504 sessions of 41 experiments (34 experiments from previous Expeditions and seven new experiments) are planned to be implemented. The new experiments include, Molniya-Gamma, Sprut-2, UHF-radiometry, SLS, VIRU, Test and Colon Crystal.
Experiments to be carried out include:
Mission highlights.
Progress M-05M undocking.
The Russian resupply spacecraft Progress M-05M, which came to the station in May 2010, was undocked on 25 October 2010 to make room for another resupply spacecraft - Progress M-08M.
Progress M-08M.
Progress M-08M spacecraft delivered about 2.5 tons of cargo supplies including water, air, fuel and hardware for the Russian Molniya-Gamma and Coulomb Crystal experiments to the station.
The Soyuz-U carrier rocket with Progress M-08M, identified by NASA as Progress 40 or 40P, was launched from the Baikonur's Gagarin's launch pad at 15:11:50 UTC on 27 October 2010. After three days of autonomous flight, at 16:36 UTC on 30 October 2010 Progress M-08M docked with the Pirs module nadir port. A problem during Progress' approach to the space station forced cosmonauts on the station to intervene. During station-keeping as part of the rendezvous operations, flight controllers in Moscow instructed cosmonaut Alexander Kaleri to activate the TORU manual docking equipment and take over the piloting tasks from the Progress' autonomous KURS system. The switch to manual mode was decided at range of 194 m. Kaleri worked inside the space station's Zvezda module to fly Progress M-08M remotely using television views and a pair of joysticks and guided it to the successful docking.

The Nash-Fortenberry UFO sighting was an unidentified flying object sighting that occurred on July 14, 1952, when two commercial pilots (William B. Nash and William H. Fortenberry) claimed to have seen eight UFOs flying in a tight echelon formation over Chesapeake Bay in the state of Virginia. 
UFOlogists say the pilots observation allowed for relatively precise measurements of the objects' motion and size when compared to known landmarks, and that the encounter was corroborated by several groups of independent ground witnesses.

Arthur Catterall was born in Preston, Lancashire, the son of John Catterall, a painter and his wife Elizabeth, a cotton weaver. He was an extremely gifted musician in childhood. He first played the violin in public at a concert in Preston when he was 6 years old. He played the Mendelssohn violin concerto in Manchester at the age of 9. Catterall received his elementary education under the Jesuits at St Ignatius Roman Catholic School, Preston until 1893 when he was accepted as a Boarder at St Bede's College, Manchester, during this time he also studied at the Royal Manchester College of Music under Willy Hess in 1894 and under Adolph Brodsky in 1895. Catterall graduated from St Bede's at the age of 16 in 1898.
In 1902, at the age of 18, he was invited to Bayreuth by Hans Richter and played at all of Cosima Wagner's musical evenings in that season. He appeared at a Hallé Orchestra concert in 1903 playing Tchaikovsky's concerto.
Orchestral leader.
In 1909 Catterall became leader of the promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall. In 1911 he acquired the violin made by Jean Baptiste Vuillaume, c. 1843, which had belonged to Ferdinand David. In 1907 he was appointed Professor of violin at the Royal Manchester College of Music (a post he held for many years) and became leader of the Hallé Orchestra, where he remained until 1925. In 1913 he obtained the 'Baillot-Pommereau' 1694 instrument by Antonio Stradivarius, and in September of that year performed the Violin Concerto BV 243 of Ferruccio Busoni with the Queen's Hall Orchestra under Henry Wood. He later gave the English premiere, also at a prom, of the (1911–1912) Violin concerto of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, which had been dedicated to Maud Powell.
Chamber music.
In addition to his orchestral and teaching work, Catterall was active in chamber music throughout his career. In 1915 Frederick Delius wrote a Sonata for violin and piano for Catterall and the pianist R.J. Forbes. He led the Catterall Players, an ensemble for chamber performance, which performed the Elgar quintet in 1921. He had connections with the London Chamber Music Players (led by Albert Sammons), with the pianist William Murdoch (pianist) and 'cellist W. H. Squire, and founded and in 1910 founded and led a string quartet under his own name as the Catterall Quartet. In this John S. Bridge played 2nd violin, Frank S. Park (viola) and Johan C. Hock (cello). Hans Keller described their work as 'imaginative'. From 1926 to 1931 Laurance Turner was second violin in the quartet.
The quartet made recordings for His Master's Voice in the early 1920s, including Beethoven's op 18 nos 1 (1922–1923) and 2 (1923–1924), Arensky 2nd Quartet op 35a, and the Brahms Quartet no 1 (June 1923). They also recorded Beethoven op 130 at full length by the acoustic process, but this remained unissued. Catterall also played in a Trio called The Manchester Trio.
At the same time Catterall was recording for Columbia Records as a soloist in complete versions of Mozart's Concerto no 5 in A minor K219, and Bach's concerto for two violins with John S. Bridge, both under the direction of Hamilton Harty, c. 1924. The quartet also transferred to recording for Columbia. He recorded the Brahms violin sonata in D minor with Murdoch in November 1923. He also recorded by the electrical microphone process after 1925. In the 1933 Columbia catalogue the standard recording of Tchaikovsky's Trio no 2, op 50 (on 12 sides) was by Catterall, Murdoch and Squire.
Move to London.
After many years teaching at the Manchester College, Catterall became Professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Among his pupils were Harry Blech, Walter Appleyard, Eugene Genin, Arthur Leavins, Laurance Turner, Gloria Pashley, and also Olive Zorian (1916–65) (founder and leader of the Zorian Quartet which pioneered works by Michael Tippett in 1943–44 and those of Britten soon afterwards). After leaving the Hallé orchestra he concentrated on solo work, performing for example the Beethoven concerto under Thomas Beecham with the London Symphony Orchestra in March 1927. He also developed as a conductor, taking the third concert of the 1929 Delius Festival at the Queen's Hall (Eventyr, Cynara, Piano concerto, Arabesk and Appalachia).
In 1929, Catterall became the founding leader of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, though the proms were at first led by his assistant violin Charles Woodhouse. When the orchestra first appeared in full strength (115 players), on October 22, 1930, at the Queen's Hall in its inaugural concert with the "Flying Dutchman" overture, Brahms' Fourth Symphony, the Saint-Saëns cello concerto (with Guilhermina Suggia) and Ravel's Symphonic Fragments from "Daphnis et Chloé", under Adrian Boult, Catterall led the orchestra.
In 1932, Granville Bantock dedicated his second violin sonata to Catterall (the first having been to Albert Sammons). Catterall retired from his position with the BBC Orchestra in 1936, to devote his time to solo work and teaching. He formed another chamber orchestra for young string players, The Catterall String Orchestra, led from 1940 to 1943 by Audrey Catterall (b. 1917).
He remained busy into the first years of the war, still a champion of contemporary composers. He performed the Brahms double concerto (with cellist Thelma Reiss) and gave the English premiere of Felix Weingartner's Sinfonietta (with Reiss and violist Bernard Shore) under Weingartner's baton at a Royal Philharmonic concert in February 1939. He was memorably associated with the cellist Antonia Butler in a prom performance at the Queen's Hall of the Brahms double concerto in August 1940. After an air-raid warning was heard and the audience was obliged to remain indoors, the musicians improvised an all-night concert. The work of the Catterall Quartet (with Audrey Catterall as second violin) continued, for on 5 February 1942 it gave the first performance of the String Quartet in G minor ('Kenilworth'), op 99, by Armstrong Gibbs at Windermere. On 8 July 1942 he gave the world premiere of the Violin concerto dedicated to him by E.J. Moeran, under Henry Wood, and repeated his performance, with Wood, for the Royal Philharmonic concert of 5 December 1942.
He died in London in November 1943: Moeran was present at the death or soon after. An Arthur Catterall Cup for violin or viola concerto performance is competed for in the Feis Ceoil.

View model

A view model or viewpoints framework in systems engineering, software engineering, and enterprise engineering is a framework which defines a coherent set of "views" to be used in the construction of a system architecture, software architecture, or enterprise architecture. A "view" is a representation of a whole system from the perspective of a related set of concerns.
Since the early 1990s there have been a number of efforts to prescribe approaches for describing and analyzing system architectures. These recent efforts define a set of views (or viewpoints). They are sometimes referred to as architecture frameworks or enterprise architecture frameworks, but are not usually called "view models".
Usually a "view" is a work product that presents specific architecture data for a given system. However, the same term is sometimes used to refer to a view "definition", including the particular viewpoint and the corresponding guidance that defines each concrete view. The term "view model" is related to view definitions.
Overview.
The purpose of views and viewpoints is to enable humans to comprehend very complex systems, to organize the elements of the problem and the solution around domains of expertise and to separate concerns. In the engineering of physically intensive systems, viewpoints often correspond to capabilities and responsibilities within the engineering organization.
Most complex system specifications are so extensive that no single individual can fully comprehend all aspects of the specifications. Furthermore, we all have different interests in a given system and different reasons for examining the system's specifications. A business executive will ask different questions of a system make-up than would a system implementer. The concept of viewpoints framework, therefore, is to provide separate viewpoints into the specification of a given complex system in order to facilitate communication with the stakeholders. Each viewpoint satisfies an audience with interest in a particular set of aspects of the system. Each viewpoint may use a specific "viewpoint language" that optimizes the vocabulary and presentation for the audience of that viewpoint. Viewpoint modeling has become an effective approach for dealing with the inherent complexity of large distributed systems.
Architecture description practices, as described in IEEE Std 1471-2000, utilize multiple views to address several areas of concerns, each one focusing on a specific aspect of the system. Examples of architecture frameworks using multiple views include Kruchten's "4+1" view model, the Zachman Framework, TOGAF, DoDAF and, RM-ODP.
History.
In the 1970s, methods began to appear in software engineering for
modeling with multiple views. Ross and Schoman (1977) introduce the constructs context,
viewpoint, and vantage point to organize the modeling process in systems requirements definition.
According to Ross and Schoman, a viewpoint "makes clear what aspects are considered relevant to
achieving ... the overall purpose the model" and determines "How do we look at subject being modelled?"
As examples of viewpoints, the paper offers: Technical, Operational and Economic viewpoints.
In 1992, Finkelstein et al., published a very important paper on viewpoints. In that work: "A viewpoint can be thought of as a combination of the idea of a “actor”, “knowledge source”, “role” or “agent” in the development process and the idea of a “view” or “perspective” which an actor maintains." An important idea in this paper was to distinguish "a "representation style", the scheme and notation by which the viewpoint expresses what it can see" and "a "specification", the statements expressed in the viewpoint's style describing particular domains". Subsequent work, such as IEEE 1471, preserved this distinction by utilizing two separate terms: viewpoint and view, respectively.
Since the early 1990s there have been a number of efforts to codify approaches for describing and analyzing system architectures. These are often terms architecture frameworks or sometimes "viewpoint sets". Many of these have been funded by the United States Department of Defense, but some have sprung from international or national efforts in ISO or the IEEE. Among these, the IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software-Intensive Systems (IEEE Std 1471-2000) established useful definitions of view, viewpoint, stakeholder and concern and guidelines for documenting a system architecture through the use of multiple views by applying viewpoints to address stakeholder concerns.
IEEE 1471 (now ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011, "Systems and software engineering — Architecture description") prescribes the contents of architecture descriptions and describes their creation and use under a number of scenarios, including precedented and unprecedented design, evolutionary design, and capture of design of existing systems. In all of these scenarios the overall process is the same: identify stakeholders, elicit concerns, identify a set of viewpoints to be used, and then apply these viewpoint specifications to develop the set of views relevant to the system of interest. Rather than define a particular set of viewpoints, the standard provides uniform mechanisms and requirements for architects and organizations to define their own viewpoints. In 1996 the ISO Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) was published to provide a useful framework for describing the architecture and design of large scale distributed systems.
View model topics.
View.
A view of a system is a representation of the system from the perspective of a viewpoint. This viewpoint on a system involves a perspective focusing on specific concerns regarding the system, which suppresses details to provide a simplified model having only those elements related to the concerns of the viewpoint. For example, a security viewpoint focuses on security concerns and a security viewpoint model contains those elements that are related to security from a more general model of a system.
A view allows a user to examine a portion of a particular interest area. For example, an Information View may present all functions, organizations, technology, etc. that use a particular piece of information, while the Organizational View may present all functions, technology, and information of concern to a particular organization. In the Zachman Framework views comprise a group of work products whose development requires a particular analytical and technical expertise because they focus on either the “what,” “how,” “who,” “where,” “when,” or “why” of the enterprise. For example, Functional View work products answer the question “how is the mission carried out?” They are most easily developed by experts in functional decomposition using process and activity modeling. They show the enterprise from the point of view of functions. They also may show organizational and information components, but only as they relate to functions.
Viewpoints.
Viewpoint is a systems engineering concept that describes a partitioning of concerns in system restricted to a particular set of concerns. Adoption of a viewpoint is usable so that issues in those aspects can be addressed separately. A good selection of viewpoints also partitions the design of the system into specific areas of expertise.
Viewpoints provide the conventions, rules, and languages for constructing, presenting and analysing views. In ISO/IEC 42010:2007 (IEEE-Std-1471-2000) a viewpoint is a specification for an individual view. A view is a representation of a whole system from the perspective of a viewpoint. A view may consist of one or more architectural models. Each such architectural model is developed using the methods established by its associated architectural system, as well as for the system as a whole.
Modeling perspectives.
Modeling perspectives is a set of different ways to represent pre-selected aspects of a system. Each perspective has a different focus, conceptualization, dedication and visualization of what the model is representing.
In information systems, the traditional way to divide modeling perspectives is to distinguish the structural, functional and behavioral/processual perspectives. This together with rule, object, communication and actor and role perspectives is one way of classifying modeling approaches 
Viewpoint model.
In any given viewpoint, it is possible to make a model of the system that contains only the objects that are visible from that viewpoint, but also captures all of the objects, relationships and constraints that are present in the system and relevant to that viewpoint. Such a model is said to be a viewpoint model, or a view of the system from that viewpoint.
A given view is a specification for the system at a particular level of abstraction from a given viewpoint. Different levels of abstraction contain different levels of detail. Higher-level views allow the engineer to fashion and comprehend the whole design and identify and resolve problems in the large. Lower-level views allow the engineer to concentrate on a part of the design and develop the detailed specifications.
In the system itself, however, all of the specifications appearing in the various viewpoint models must be addressed in the realized components of the system. And the specifications for any given component may be drawn from many different viewpoints. On the other hand, the specifications induced by the distribution of functions over specific components and component interactions will typically reflect a different partitioning of concerns than that reflected in the original viewpoints. Thus additional viewpoints, addressing the concerns of the individual components and the bottom-up synthesis of the system, may also be useful.
Architecture description.
An architecture description is a representation of a system architecture, at any time, in terms of its component parts, how those parts function, the rules and constraints under which those parts function, and how those parts relate to each other and to the environment. In an architecture description the "architecture data" is shared across several views and products.
At the data layer are the architecture data elements and their defining attributes and relationships. At the presentation layer are the products and views that support a visual means to communicate and understand the purpose of the architecture, what it describes, and the various architectural analyses performed. Products provide a way for visualizing architecture data as graphical, tabular, or textual representations. Views provide the ability to visualize architecture data that stem across products, logically organizing the data for a specific or holistic perspective of the architecture.
Types of System View Models.
Three schema approach.
The Three schema approach for data modeling, introduced in 1977, can be considered one of the first view models. It is an approach to building information systems and systems information management, that promotes the conceptual model as the key to achieving data integration. The Three schema approach defines three schema's and views:
At the center, the conceptual schema defines the ontology of the concepts as the users think of them and talk about them. The physical schema describes the internal formats of the data stored in the database, and the external schema defines the view of the data presented to the application programs. The framework attempted to permit multiple data models to be used for external schemata.
Over the years, the skill and interest in building information systems has grown tremendously. However, for the most part, the traditional approach to building systems has only focused on defining data from two distinct views, the "user view" and the "computer view". From the user view, which will be referred to as the “external schema,” the definition of data is in the context of reports and screens designed to aid individuals in doing their specific jobs. The required structure of data from a usage view changes with the business environment and the individual preferences of the user. From the computer view, which will be referred to as the “internal schema,” data is defined in terms of file structures for storage and retrieval. The required structure of data for computer storage depends upon the specific computer technology employed and the need for efficient processing of data.
4+1 view model of architecture.
4+1 is a view model designed by Philippe Kruchten in 1995 for describing the architecture of software-intensive systems, based on the use of multiple, concurrent views. The views are used to describe the system in the viewpoint of different stakeholders, such as end-users, developers and project managers. The four views of the model are logical, development, process and physical view:
The four views of the model are concerned with :
In addition selected use cases or scenarios are utilized to illustrate the architecture. Hence the model contains 4+1 views.
Types of Enterprise Architecture View Models.
Enterprise Architecture framework defines how to organize the structure and views associated with an Enterprise Architecture. Because the discipline of Enterprise Architecture and Engineering is so broad, and because enterprises can be large and complex, the models associated with the discipline also tend to be large and complex. To manage this scale and complexity, an Architecture Framework provides tools and methods that can bring the task into focus and allow valuable artifacts to be produced when they are most needed.
Architecture Frameworks are commonly used in Information technology and Information system governance. An organization may wish to mandate that certain models be produced before a system design can be approved. Similarly, they may wish to specify certain views be used in the documentation of procured systems - the U.S. Department of Defense stipulates that specific DoDAF views be provided by equipment suppliers for capital project above a certain value.
Zachman Framework.
The Zachman Framework, originally conceived by John Zachman at IBM in the 1987, is a framework for enterprise architecture, which provides a formal and highly structured way of viewing and defining an enterprise.
The Framework is used for organizing architectural "artifacts" in a way that takes into account both who the artifact targets (for example, business owner and builder) and what particular issue (for example, data and functionality) is being addressed. These artifacts may include design documents, specifications, and models.
The Zachman Framework is often referenced as a standard approach for expressing the basic elements of enterprise architecture. The Zachman Framework has been recognized by the U.S. Federal Government as having "... received worldwide acceptance as an integrated framework for managing change in enterprises and the systems that support them."
RM-ODP views.
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) specifies a set of viewpoints for partitioning the design of a distributed software/hardware system. Since most integration problems arise in the design of such systems or in very analogous situations, these viewpoints may prove useful in separating integration concerns. The RMODP viewpoints are:
RMODP further defines a requirement for a design to contain specifications of consistency between viewpoints, including:
DoDAF views.
The Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) defines a standard way to organize an enterprise architecture (EA) or systems architecture into complementary and consistent views. It is especially suited to large systems with complex integration and interoperability challenges, and is apparently unique in its use of "operational views" detailing the external customer's operating domain in which the developing system will operate.
The DoDAF defines a set of products that act as mechanisms for visualizing, understanding,
and assimilating the broad scope and complexities of an architecture description through graphic,
tabular, or textual means. These products are organized under four views: 
Each view depicts certain perspectives of an architecture as described below. Only a subset of the full DoDAF viewset is usually created for each system development. The figure represents the information that links the operational view, systems and services view, and technical standards view. The three views and their interrelationships driven – by common architecture data elements – provide the basis for
deriving measures such as interoperability or performance, and for measuring the impact of the values of these metrics on operational mission and task effectiveness.
Federal Enterprise Architecture views.
In the US Federal Enterprise Architecture enterprise, segment, and solution architecture provide different business perspectives by varying the level of detail and addressing related but distinct concerns. Just as enterprises are themselves hierarchically organized, so are the different views provided by each type of architecture. The Federal Enterprise Architecture Practice Guidance (2006) has defined three types of architecture:
By definition, Enterprise Architecture (EA) is fundamentally concerned with identifying common or shared assets – whether they are strategies, business processes, investments, data, systems, or technologies. EA is driven by strategy; it helps an agency identify whether its resources are properly aligned to the agency mission and strategic goals and objectives. From an investment perspective, EA is used to drive decisions about the IT investment portfolio as a whole. Consequently, the primary stakeholders of the EA are the senior managers and executives tasked with ensuring the agency fulfills its mission as effectively and efficiently as possible.
By contrast, segment architecture defines a simple roadmap for a core mission area, business service, or enterprise service. Segment architecture is driven by business management and delivers products that improve the delivery of services to citizens and agency staff. From an investment perspective, segment architecture drives decisions for a business case or group of business cases supporting a core mission area or common or shared service. The primary stakeholders for segment architecture are business owners and managers. Segment architecture is related to EA through three principles: structure, reuse, and alignment. First, segment architecture inherits the framework used by the EA, although it may be extended and specialized to meet the specific needs of a core mission area or common or shared service. Second, segment architecture reuses important assets defined at the enterprise level including: data; common business processes and investments; and applications and technologies. Third, segment architecture aligns with elements defined at the enterprise level, such as business strategies, mandates, standards, and performance measures.
Nominal set of views.
In search of "Framework for Modeling Space Systems Architectures" Peter Shames and Joseph Skipper (2006) defined a "nominal set of views", Derived from CCSDS RASDS, RM-ODP, ISO 10746 and compliant with IEEE 1471.
This "set of views", as described below, is a listing of possible modeling viewpoints. Not all of these views may be used for any one project and other views may be defined as necessary. Note that for some analyses elements from multiple viewpoints may be combined into a new view, possibly using a layered representation.
In a latter presentation this nominal set of views was presented as an Extended RASDS Semantic Information Model Derivation. Hereby RASDS stands for Reference Architecture for Space Data Systems. see second image.
In contrast to the previous listed view models, this "nominal set of views" lists a whole range of views, possible to develop powerful and extensible approaches for describing a general class of software intensive system architectures.

SS Hungarian

SS "Hungarian" was a steamship of the Canadian Allan Line, built in Dumbarton, Scotland in 1858 for transatlantic service. She was wrecked in 1860 at Cape Sable Island, off Nova Scotia, with the loss of all aboard.
Rescue of the "John Martin".
At 8:00 on November 9, 1859, the "Hungarian" spotted a vessel in distress in a strong northerly gale and high seas off the edge of the Newfoundland Banks. A crew of 7 men (including the Chief Officer Hardie and 3rd Officer Porter) were lowered into a lifeboat, and headed to the vessel. Upon arriving within shouting range, they were told the ship was the British schooner "John Martin", which also carried the rescued crew of another schooner wrecked off Labrador. The sinking "John Martin" was abandoned by its 43 passengers, including 23 women and children. Chief Officer Hardie was knocked overboard while helping passengers into the "Hungarian". He could not swim, but hauled himself aboard via rope, and survived the ordeal.
"Hungarian" headed for St. John's and arrived on the morning of the November 10. Each member of the "Hungarian's" crew that had helped in the lifeboat was given a party by the passengers of the trip, and also received a silver cup for their heroic act.
Sinking.
On February 8, 1860, "Hungarian" left Liverpool, England, destined for Portland, Maine, under the command of Captain Thomas Jones. She called at Queenstown, Ireland, and departed from there on February 9, 1860. On the night of February 19, she wrecked on Cape Ledge, the west side of Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, with total loss of life. The wrecked ship—and the survivors that clung to it—were visible from shore, but unreachable due to high seas and gale-force winds that did not relent until six days later.
Newspaper articles were published for months after the incident. Most messages about the disaster were sent out from Barrington Telegraph and relayed to major cities. News of the wreck following so soon after that of her sister ship "Indian" "threw a sense of gloom over the whole of British America". It was feared that among the passengers were some well-known colonists. News traveled slowly and it was undoubtedly a very intense time for everyone who picked up a newspaper.
With 205 lives lost that night, its stands as one of the worst marine disasters in Canadian history.

Kangiryuatjagmiut

Kangiryuatjagmiut (or Kanghiryatmagmiut; or Kanhiryuatjidgmiut) were a Copper Inuit subgroup. They lived around Minto Inlet, and between Minto inlet and Walker Bay.
The Kangiryuatjagmiut and the Kangiryuarmiut of Prince Albert Sound were the northernmost Copper Inuit. As with the Kangiryuarmiut, the Kangiryuatjagmiut migrated seasonally throughout western Victoria Island, Banks Island, and the mainland in the area of present day Kugluktuk, Nunavut. Prior to white contact, and the introduction of schooners, the Kangiryuarmiut migrated mostly by foot, developing what Nuttall (1992) referred to as an "embodied memoryscape" in that people knew all place names en route, the accompanying stories, and a collective significance and relational understanding of locations. According to Balanoff and Chambers, this knowledge is integral to social identity and Inuinnaqtun literacies.

David et Jonathan

David et Jonathan was a 1980s vocal duet composed of David Marouani (born on 1969) and Jonathan Bermudes (born in 1968). Their notoriety is due to their hits "Bella vita", "Gina" and "Est-ce que tu viens pour les vacances ?" which achieved huge success in France in 1987 and 1988 and earned Silver and Gold certifications. Several of their songs were written by Didier Barbelivien. The band split off in 1990 and both singers began a (unsuccessful) solo career.

Gérald Forschelet

Gérald Forschelet (born 19 September 1981 in Papeete, Tahiti) is a Tahitian-French professional football player who plays as defensive midfielder.
Career.
Cannes.
Forschelet started his career at Cannes on 1998, debuting for the team on 17 February 2001 in a Ligue 2 match against Montpellier. He played in other 6 matches in that season when the club was relegated to Championnat National. Playing at the 3rd tier of French football, Forschelet caught the attention of English club Bolton Wanderers and signed for the Premier League team on February 2002.
Bolton Wanderers.
Forschelet never managed to get first team football at Bolton Wanderers after facing competition with players like Kevin Nolan, Per Frandsen, Iván Campo and Jay-Jay Okocha. Playing only for the reserve team during the whole 2002-03 season, the Tahitian left the club on loan for the whole 2003-04 season.
Neuchâtel Xamax.
Arriving at Neuchâtel Xamax on loan, Forschelet managed to break into the first team with 24 appearances and 6 goals at Axpo Super League being used as right-midfielder and even as an attacking midfield. Upon his return, he was released from Bolton Wanderers and signed for French club FC Istres. Having limited play time due to injuries, Forschelet grabbed only two Ligue 1 appearances against Nantes and Lille before being released and returning to Neuchâtel Xamax where injuries once again hit the Tahitian midfielder who played the 90 minutes in only one of his 11 appearances.
Charleroi.
Forschelet was transferred to Belgian Charleroi on 2005, after the club has finished 5th on 2004-05 Belgian First Division. He played 14 times for the Zèbres, scoring once.

Harvey Hyde

Harvey Hyde (born July 12, 1939) is a sports journalist and former American football coach. He served as the head football coach at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) from 1982 to 1985.
Hyde started his college head coaching career at Pasadena City College. He graduated from the University of Redlands.
The Rebels had unprecedented success in the 1984 season; with 
star quarterback Randall Cunningham, UNLV went 11-2, won their conference title and defeated Toledo in the California Bowl. It was UNLV's only 11-win season. Hyde was at one point a candidate for the vacant head coaching position at Arizona State. 
However, it was later discovered the Rebels had used ineligible players, and the Big West Conference had the Rebels forfeit all the wins from the 1984 season, though the wins were not stricken from NCAA and UNLV records. Although none of the ineligible players were used in the bowl game, the California Bowl was among the games forfeited. The issue erupted at the same time the university president, Robert Maxson, was in the middle of an hostile relationship with the school's famous head basketball coach, Jerry Tarkanian, over similar off-the-court issues with players. The athletic director at the time, Brad Rothermel, noted in later years that Maxson wanted to fire Hyde because of the coach's friendship with Jerry Tarkanian's brother, Myron, stating "When President Maxson discovered (that friendship), he did what he could to level the legs of the football program. We didn't recover from that." During the 1985 season, one of Hyde's players was Marion "Suge" Knight. Among his coaching staff was future Fresno State head coach Pat Hill.
Things became more difficult for the embattled coach, as nine of his players got involved in various scrapes with the law ranging from theft to assault. Finally, on April 23, 1986, Hyde was fired by Maxon with three years left on his $62,500-a-year contract, which the university said it would honor. One of his assistant coaches, Wayne Nunnely, was named interim head coach through the 1986 season, before being chosen as his permanent successor. His firing marked a period of decline for the Rebels that lasted for over two decades.
Hyde coached football one last time in 1990, as George Allen's associate head coach, recruiting coordinator and running backs coach at Long Beach State. During that year, Hyde recruited future National Football League star Terrell Davis. Their tenure would only last one season as Allen died just after the end of the regular season, in part due to weak health after his players drenched him with ice water to celebrate a season-ending victory over UNLV. In interviewing to be the permanent head coach of Long Beach State, a program which was under financial duress, Hyde offered radical ideas of having the team play only road games, recruit only junior college players and use only one set of uniforms; he was not selected and the program only lasted one more season before finally shutting down.
After football, Hyde went on to do sports radio for KSHP-AM 1400 in Las Vegas, and working as part of the USC football pregame show for ESPN Radio 710 in Los Angeles.

Timeline of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2003 Atlantic hurricane season was an active Atlantic hurricane season with tropical activity before and after the official bounds of the season – the first such occurrence in 50 years. The season officially began on June 1, 2003 and ended on November 30. However, a pre-season storm, Tropical Storm Ana, led to the season starting on April 20, and storm activity continued through December 11. The timeline includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipations during the season.
This season had 21 tropical depressions, 16 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, "i.e." those that rank as Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Hurricane Fabian, Hurricane Isabel, and Hurricane Juan had their names retired due to the impact caused in Bermuda, the eastern United States, and Nova Scotia respectively. Both Fabian and Juan were the worst hurricanes to hit their respective areas, causing $450 million in damages and 16 fatalities. Hurricane Isabel was the strongest, deadliest, and costliest storm of the season. Isabel peaked as a Category 5 hurricane over the open waters of the Atlantic; however, it weakened to a Category 2 before impacting the east coast of the United States, causing $3.6 billion in damages and 51 fatalities.

Coming Down from Red Lodge

Coming Down from Red Lodge is an album by American musician Peter Ostroushko, released in 2003. 
All the songs were written for performance on "A Prairie Home Companion". Guests include Pat Donohue and Greg Leisz.
Reception.
"Sing Out!" stated in its Summer 2003 review: "Ostroushko, like Antonín Dvořák and Aaron Copland before him is able to grasp the kernel of music at the center of "the American experience", and transform it into a larger, more colorful whole... "Coming Down from Red Lodge" is destined to become one of Ostroushko's most popular recordings."
Writing for Allmusic, music critic Chris Nickson wrote the album is "a perfect illustration of his breadth and instrumental virtuosity on both fiddle and mandolin... The only track that doesn't really work is "Hymn: Page 9/11", perhaps because the emotions involved remain too fresh to be put into notes. With that caveat, this is one of Ostroushko's best releases — and that statement alone is no small praise, given his stature as one of the American greats."

The Survivors (Australian band)

The Survivors were a Brisbane punk rock band that originally formed in 1976 as Rat Salad, a party band, The Survivors attained cult status in Australia by their acknowledged popular live performances and contribution to the "Lethal Weapons" punk compilation album. Original band members were Greg Williamson on guitar and vocals, Jim Dickson on bass guitar and vocals, Bruce Anthon on drums and vocals. David Nichols, from the "Mess And Noise" website, commented that, “The Survivors were legends in their home town of Brisbane, a highly popular and adept band whose sets were mainly cool ’60s covers.”
According to music historian, Ian McFarlane, Brisbane produced "some of the most anarchistic bands of the Australian punk rock era" and that it was a city nationally renowned for its ultra conservatism." The band released one single called "Baby Come Back", on the Real label in 1977, which was later reissued on the Suicide label in 1978. A live vinyl album called "Worse than Perfect" was released in 1988.
History.
The Survivors, a southern suburbs Brisbane band, had a mutual admiration for 1960s music but originally they named their band Rat Salad after the Black Sabbath song. They changed their name in 1977 to The Survivors still mostly playing parties or occasionally hiring a hall, where they had to "watch out for the noise vigilant cops", "until the Curry Shop venue began supporting local punk acts in the heart of Brisbane on Sundays."
Whilst known for their energetic versions of other group’s songs, they managed to release one stamped sleeve seven inch single on the Real label. The A-side "Baby Come Back" flirted with 1960s music but also had a strong stylistic sense of original New York punk. They encountered condemnation from punk circles for being to close to Sixties covers music as Jim Dickson recounts, “Criticism was often levelled at the Survivors for their lack of original material. The band were able to exist in those punksnobbery times because their energy was equal to anyone's and purely dedicated to the music which transcended the transient social commitments of the time.”
Mushroom Records subsidiary label Suicide Records reissued the seven inch single and added both songs onto the "Lethal Weapons" compilation album in 1978. This was the extent of their output when they were still in existence. The band broke up in late 1978 but did manage to do shows in Sydney later on including a show with The Visitors. The band members Jim Dickson and Bruce Anthon formed The Sleepers and then The Shakers.
In 1979 Jim Dickson went on to record with Sydney act The Passengers, whose singer was Angie Pepper later known for The Angie Pepper Band and the single "Frozen World". Jim Dickson also went on to play for profile bands that included The Barracudas, The Deniz Tek Group and Radio Birdman amongst many others. According to Jim Dickson, "Bruce and Greg had been busy in '79 with the Credits, who recorded a single, "It's You" / "Fazed Dazed", for the Rocking Horse Record Shop label". Drummer, Bruce Anthon, went on to play with numerous other groups, including bands that did jazz or blues.
Legacy.
In 1988 the band managed to retrospectively release an album recorded live in August 1978 at the Rex Hotel, Kings Cross, Sydney, called "Worse than Perfect".

Coelbren, Powys

Coelbren is a small rural village just south of the Brecon Beacons National Park in Powys, Wales. It lies some six miles north-east of Ystradgynlais, close to Sgwd Henrhyd, a high waterfall on the Nant Llech. To the east of the village flows the Afon Pyrddin which plunges over two more spectacular falls.
History.
The Roman road of Sarn Helen runs close to the village on its eastern side. Its remains and that of a Roman fort are now much degraded. The Brecon Forest Tramroad was constructed through the village in the 1820s. Of note to the east of Coelbren is the site of Banwen Ironworks, whose partial survival is owed to its early failure. It was constructed in the 1840s by speculators from London but may have produced only 80 tons of pig iron, the whole exercise being enveloped in a financial scandal.
From the 1873, Coelbren was the location of a significant junction on the Neath and Brecon Railway whence a 7-mile branch diverged leading to the Swansea Vale Railway at Ynysygeinon. The contractor John Dickson had a terrace of houses constructed quite possibly for navvies working on the line and known originally as Dickson's Row though now known as Price's Row. The lines closed in 1962 though the trackbed can still be seen almost encircling the eastern part of the village. The route to Swansea Vale has now been converted into a cycleway as Route 43 of the National Cycle Network linking the village with Ystradgynlais; it is planned that the trackbed northwards towards Brecon should also form part of Route 43. The A4109 Inter Valley Road between Glynneath and Abercraf passes to the immediate south of the village, its construction in the early 20th century rendering the village less isolated than it had been hitherto.
People.
Famous residents include musician and professional skier Simon Hewitt.

List of Swedish submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film

Swedish submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film are handed out annually by representatives from the Guldbagge jury.
Sweden has submitted films for consideration in the Best Foreign Language Film category since the inaugural award in 1956. The Swedes have sent more films that any other country, except from France, Italy, Japan and Spain, and have only failed to submit a film one time in the past thirty years.
14 films from Sweden have been nominated for the Academy Award: "The Virgin Spring" (1960), "Through a Glass Darkly" (1961), "Raven's End" (1964), "Dear John" (1965), "Ådalen '31" (1969), "The Emigrants" (1971), "The New Land" (1972), "Flight of the Eagle" (1982), "Fanny and Alexander" (1983), "The Ox" (1991), "All Things Fair" (1995), "Under the Sun" (1999), "Evil" (2003) and "As It Is in Heaven" (2004). Three Swedish films have won the Oscar: "The Virgin Spring" (1960), "Through a Glass Darkly" (1961) and "Fanny and Alexander" (1983). All the winners have been directed by Ingmar Bergman, who represented Sweden a record eight times. Other prominent directors include Bo Widerberg and Jan Troell, both who have had three of their films nominated. The 1988 winner "Pelle the Conqueror" was a Swedish-Danish co-production, but was submitted by Denmark. In 2002 there was a bit of controversy as Sweden's submission "Lilja 4-ever" had most of its dialogue in Russian and not Swedish. Eventually it was accepted as eligible, but did not receive a nomination.
Submissions.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Sweden for review by the Academy for the award by year.

He debuted at the age of 18 with two plays performed at the theatre of Rennes. He founded and edited for a period the newspaper "La Jeunesse" (Youth). In 1889 he published with Guy Ropartz "Le Parnasse breton contemporain" (The Modern Breton Parnassus), an anthology of Breton poetry of the 2nd half of the nineteenth century. In October 1890, he founded the "Revue L’Hermine" (Ermine Revue), the ermine being the symbol of Brittany.

<doc id="20061949" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20061949" title="Chambre de bonne">
Chambre de bonne

A chambre de bonne is a type of French apartment consisting of a single room in a middle-class house or apartment building. It is generally found on the top floor and only accessible by a staircase; sometimes a separate "service staircase". Initially, these rooms were intended as the bedroom for one of the family's domestics, and the name originates from the colloquial name for such maids: a "bonne à tout faire". Today, "chambres de bonne" are usually the cheapest rung on the Parisian letting market, and are primarily rented by less well-off workers and students. They are also in high demand among workers who wish to maintain a small room or postal address in a big city, especially Paris.
Due to the social level of the envisaged occupants, "chambres de bonne" are characterised by their tight proportions. The rooms usually have a surface area of around 6–12 m2, which is sometimes accentuated by being in a garret. They tend to offer minimal facilities: toilets are usually shared with the neighbouring rooms, and located on the landing.
"Chambres de bonne" have nevertheless been the object of legislation to preserve their occupants' quality of life and health. In the twentieth century, the French government stipulated that all rental properties must have a minimum surface area of 9 m2, a volume of 20 m3, and openings (windows, doors, etc.) equivalent to an eighth of the surface area.
In recent years, landlords have attempted to rebrand their "chambres de bonne" by advertising them as "studettes", a hitherto-unknown category of housing for smaller studios (broadly, those of 12 m2 or less). Since most listings agencies do not recognise a firm distinction between "studios" and "studettes", "chambres de bonne" may also simply be advertised as studios. Parisian apartment-hunters are, nevertheless, often able to infer that a studio is a "chambre de bonne" from its listing, due to the distinctive features described above.

Union Station (Owensboro, Kentucky)

The Union Station in Owensboro, Kentucky is a historic railroad station, built in 1905. Built mostly for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, the station is made of limestone and slate, and currently is home to several businesses.
Description.
The Union Station, unlike most urban railroad stations, was situated in a "more spacious area". In the west end was a waiting area, and the east end featured a two-story freight section. The station gains a Gothic look with wooden barge boarding and brackets on its gabled entrance.
The L&N used the second floor of the building for support services and administration.
History.
The first railroad company in Owensboro was the Owensboro and Russellville Railroad, in operation from 1867 to 1876. After the O&R went bankrupt, the Owensboro and Nashville Railroad took over the assets, and were in control until purchased by the L&N in 1879.
The station was a joint effort between the L&N, the Louisville, Henderson and St. Louis Railroad, and the Illinois Central Railroad, building over an older depot of the Louisville, Henderson and St. Louis. The plans were designed by Henry F. Hawes and John B. Hutchings and constructed by Walter Brashear. The initial work was completed in 1906.
At its height in the 1920s, the station daily served eighteen passenger trains. In 1958, the station stopped being used for passenger traffic, as the L&N claimed annual losses of $130,000 for continuing the passenger service.
Since then it has seen several different uses. In the 1970s it was used as a discothèque and then a pizza parlor, but both were unsuccessful, leaving the station empty for a time. Major over hauls of the station occurred in 1982 and 1988, with the latter seeing a two-story atrium and office added to its eastern side. Current tenants include a preschool, an architectural design group, an adult day care, and a Hilliard Lyons office.

Ateneo de Manila College Glee Club

The Ateneo de Manila College Glee Club (Ateneo Glee Club, or ACGC) is a choir based in the Ateneo de Manila University, Philippines. It is distinguished as the oldest university chorale in the Philippines, having celebrated its 90th year in 2011. It has held concerts internationally, and has released several albums with songs genres ranging from Classical, Negro spiritual, Sacred choral works, as well as Pop, and OPM. The Glee Club remains active internationally through the performances it stages and choral festivals it participates in.
History.
The Glee Club was started in 1921, the year the American Jesuits took over the administration of Ateneo Municipal de Manila. Its primary function was providing liturgical music at the San Ignacio Church in old Intramuros. Jose Mossesgeld Santiago, a 1911 graduate of the Ateneo who became the first Filipino to sing at La Scala de Milan, was appointed conductor.
Following a three-year hiatus, James B. Reuter restarted the Glee Club. In 1974, when the university turned co-educational, the choir became mixed.
The ACGC peaked in 1979 when Joel Navarro, a recipient of an award from the Metro Manila Popular Music Festival for his composition "Swerte Swerte Lang", arrived at the scene. A string of performances of the choir including the innovative Concert in Your Homes, TV and 5-star hotel shows and the 1980 National Music Competition for Young Artists (NAMCYA) where they bagged the First Prize in the College Division, followed. When the second International Choral Festival was held in the Cultural Center of the Philippines the year after, the Glee Club was top-rated among the Philippine choirs that participated for "opening the gates of heaven with their moving rendition of Thompson's Alleluia" as a critic wrote.
In 1989, they went on a brief European tour and were cited Best Choir in the international festivals in Loreto, Italy and Nancy, France. A year later, Navarro took a 3-year leave due to pressure of work from the University of the Philippines (UP), and the Asian Institute of Liturgy and Music (AILM). Eudenice Palaruan, Navarro's friend and replacement as conductor, began North American and Guam concert tours, a national tour, and a concert with Lea Salonga in Manila.
Navarro's determination to eschew the lure of European tilts and steer his group toward a niche in the recording arena paid off in 1996 when the GC snared a couple of Katha awards: for Best rendition of a Traditional song "Lagi kitang Naaalala" and for Best Traditional Music Album for "Lahi". It was a first for any university-based chorale, and more importantly, Lahi became the first and by far the only classical, choral or traditional recording to be nominated Album of the Year competing against the country's mainstream commercial recordings. Then, he led them in successful concert tours in Guam and North America (1997), in a national tour (1998), and in Guam again(1999).
Year 2000 and onwards.
At the turn of the millennium, the glee club scaled the greatest heights. Under Navarro and Jonathan Velasco, two of the country's leading conductors, they swept all the competitions they joined in two months in Slovenia, Italy, Ireland and France - and reached the apex by winning the Grand Prix in Tours, France. In less than a year they added more laurels to their credentials - top prizes in Tolosa, Spain. In 2001, they won First Prize in Marktoberdorf, Germany, under the leadership of Velasco. 
The following year, the Glee Club embarked on a new paradigm in choral singing after Ramon Acoymo, alumnus of the Philippine Madrigal Singers, accomplished tenor soloist, and vocal pedagogue, took over as Musical Director. He led the new batch of the Glee Club and honed the raw but promising skills of the Katipunan-based singers. He culminated his term by commissioning new compositions of Marian songs set into choral idiom.
In 2002 the Glee Club had its first female conductor in the person, Ma. Lourdes Hermo, an alumna of the Philippine Madrigal Singers and the Philippine Youth Orchestra. Under Hermo, the choir went on a concert tour of the United States and Guam in 2004, performed in festivals, had a live recording in 2005, and celebrated its 85th year with a European competition-concert tour where they won all awards in Miltenberg, Germany and top prizes in Arezzo, Italy in 2006.
In celebration of its 90th year in 2011, the group embarked on another European Tour. It won in the 33rd International May Choir Competition in Varna, Bulgaria, earning them the distinction to compete in the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing (GPE) in Maribor, Slovenia on April 2012.

List of RAF aircrew in the Battle of Britain

The List of RAF aircrew in the Battle of Britain is a summary regarding the lists of those who flew during the Battle of Britain, and were awarded the Battle of Britain Clasp to the 1939–45 Star by flying at least one authorised operational sortie with an eligible unit of the Royal Air Force or Fleet Air Arm during the period from 0001 hours on 10 July to 2359 hours 31 October 1940.
History.
In 1942, the Air Ministry made the decision to compile a list from records of the names of pilots who had lost their lives as a result of the fighting during the Battle of Britain for the purpose of building a national memorial. This became the Battle of Britain Chapel at Westminster Abbey, which was unveiled by King George VI on 10 July 1947. The Roll of Honour within the Chapel contains the names of 1,497 pilots and aircrew killed or mortally wounded during the Battle.
Nothing was done officially, however, to define the qualifications for the classification of a Battle of Britain airman until 9 November 1960. "AMO N850", published by the Air Ministry, stated for the first time the requirements for the awarding of the Battle of Britain Star, and listed the 71 units which were deemed to have been under the control of RAF Fighter Command.
In 1955 Flt Lt John Holloway, a serving RAF officer, began a personal challenge to compile a complete list of "The Few". After fourteen years of research Flt Lt Holloway had 2,946 names on the list. Of these airmen, 537 were killed during the Battle or later died of wounds received.
The Battle of Britain Memorial Trust, founded by Geoffrey Page, raised funds for the construction of the Battle of Britain Memorial at Capel-le-Ferne near Folkestone in Kent. The Memorial, unveiled by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on 9 July 1993, shares the site with the Christopher Foxley-Norris Memorial Wall on which a complete list of "The Few" is engraved.
More recently, the Battle of Britain Monument on the Victoria Embankment in London was unveiled on 18 September 2005 by Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. The idea for the monument was conceived by the Battle of Britain Historical Society which then set about raising funds for its construction. The outside of the monument is lined with bronze plaques listing all the Allied airmen who took part in the Battle.

Diaphragmatic paradox

Diaphragmatic paradox or paradoxical diaphragm phenomenon is an abnormal medical sign observed during respiration, in which the diaphragm moves opposite to the normal directions of its movements. The diaphragm normally moves downwards during inspiration and upwards during expiration. But in diaphragmatic paradox, it moves upwards during inspiration and downwards during inspiration.
Causes and associated conditions.
Diaphragmatic paradox may be caused by weakening of inspiratory muscles due to injury, pyopneumothorax (collection of pus and excess air inside pleural cavity) or hydropneumothorax (collection of watery fluid and excess air inside pleural cavity). The patient might suffer from severe breathlessness due to the reduced functioning of the respiratory apparatus.

Thomas Fairfax, 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron

Thomas Fairfax, 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1762–1846) was the son of Bryan Fairfax. With his father, on December 11, 1799, he was among the last guests at Mount Vernon before Washington died.
He lived the life of a country squire overseeing his , lived at Belvoir, Ash Grove, and Vaucluse, where he died. He married three times: Mary Aylett, Laura Washington, Margaret Herbert. He had seven children by his third wife Margaret: Albert Fairfax, Henry Fairfax (who died in the Mexican–American War, at Saltillo, Mexico, on August 14, 1847), Orlando Fairfax, Reginald Fairfax, Eugenia Fairfax, Aurelia Fairfax, and Monimia Fairfax (mother of Constance Cary).
He maintained a winter home at 607 Cameron Street, Alexandria, Virginia, which he built in 1816.
Thomas Fairfax was a follower of Swedenborg. Because of these religious beliefs, he manumitted his slaves, taught them a trade, and sent them to Liberia. This is consistent with the thinking of the American Colonization Society.
His grandson, Charles S. Fairfax, succeeded him as Baron Cameron.

WGSF (TV)

WGSF-TV was an educational television station in Newark, Ohio, which operated from 1963 to 1976. The station was founded by The Licking County Fund for Public Giving, on behalf of the Newark City School District. Studios were originated at Newark High School. 
In the early years of the station, WGSF broadcast on UHF channel 28, programming a mix of local programming, with additional programs from National Educational Television (via film and videotape), and from WOSU-TV in Columbus (via an off-air pickup). Equipment and cameras were lent to WGSF by WCET, Cincinnati's educational station. In 1966, WCET took back the cameras, when WGSF was unable to buy them; soon after this, Cleveland CBS affiliate WJW-TV donated two cameras to WGSF.
The station broadcast on channel 28 until 1970, when the Ohio ETV Network Commission, The Ohio State University (owners of WOSU), and Nationwide Broadcasting requested that the station move to channel 31, with Nationwide providing funds for the move. In 1970 WGSF became a member station of PBS, and was soon connected to the national feed, ending reliance of WOSU for networked programming.
WGSF signed off on June 30, 1976, not only due to aging equipment, but due to opportunities for Newark City Schools to operate a channel on cable TV (due to laws mandating cable systems to devote a channel for educational television use), as well as opportunities for Ohio's PBS affiliates to expand to underserved communities. The following day after the station's closedown, WOSU opened W31AA, a low-powered repeater operating on the former WGSF's channel. Newark City School's cable channel would open in 1977, after the local cable franchise provided a cable link to Newark High. 
The channel 28 frequency would be reallocated to Columbus as a commercial frequency; this channel would be reactivated when WTTE signed on in 1984.

Plaza Theatre (Palm Springs)

The Plaza Theatre is a historic theater located at 128 South Palm Canyon Drive in Palm Springs, California. Today, the theatre remains operational as the home of The Fabulous Palm Springs Follies who have been featured on ABC's "20/20", "The Today Show", the "New York Times", and other national and international publications since its founding.
History.
It was December 12, 1936 that the historic Plaza Theatre opened with the Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor premiere "Camille". The theatre's owner at the time, Earle C. Strebe, sold the very first ticket to Annette Freeman.
In the early days of Palm Springs began the "Desert Circus" for which an annual show was staged by Melba Bennett called the "Village Insanities". Originally performed on the grounds of the Desert Inn, the "Insanities" would later perform at the Plaza Theatre under the name of the "Village Vanities" during the 1940s.
The Plaza Theatre remained active for many years, finally becoming dormant in 1989. It was at this time that television producer Riff Markowitz ("The Hitchhiker"), decided to renovate the cinema and create a "Broadway-caliber celebration of the music, dance, and comedy of the 30's, 40's, and 50's with a cast old enough to have lived it!".
Today.
Home to The Fabulous Palm Springs Follies, the Plaza Theatre has runs late October through May since 1990. The Managing Director and MC of the show, Riff Markowitz, is known for his cult classic television series "The Hilarious House of Frightenstein" and the HBO TV series "The Hitchhiker". Among the theatre's stars are Dorothy Kloss, "the World's Oldest Showgirl", Leonard Crofoot, often remembered for his roles on "Star Trek The Next Generation" and "Star Trek Voyager", and Markowitz himself.
The Plaza Theatre was the subject of a documentary, through the Follies, entitled "", directed by Mel Damski, which was nominated for an Oscar in 1998.

Michaelstein Abbey

Michaelstein Abbey (Kloster Michaelstein) is a former Cistercian monastery, now the home of the "Stiftung Kloster Michaelstein - Musikinstitut für Aufführungspraxis" ("Michaelstein Abbey Foundation - Music Institute for Performance"), near the town of Blankenburg in the Harz in Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany.
History.
In a deed of Emperor Otto I dated 956 giving property to Quedlinburg Abbey is mentioned the cave church dedicated to Saint Michael, also known as the "Volkmarskeller" (as it is still called) near the Eggeröder spring. The same deed also mentions the cell of the revered anchorite Liutbirg, which traditionally was held to have been sited in or near the cave church. The holiness of the site proved attractive, and a religious community formed round it.
In 1139 Beatrix II, abbess of Quedlinburg, founded a Cistercian monastery here, which was settled in 1146 by monks from Kamp Abbey. A few years later the new monastery was transferred away from the cave church to form Michaelstein Abbey on the present site. The abbey's growing property brought it great wealth, but it never settled any daughter houses of its own.
The monastery was sacked in 1525 by rebellious mobs during the German Peasants' War. The church was ruined beyond repair, and was never rebuilt; religious services were held from then on in the former chapter house. In 1533 the remaining buildings were ransacked and devastated by Wilhelm von Haugwitz. In 1543 the last Roman Catholic abbot resigned, and the abbey and its assets passed into the hands of the Counts of Blankenburg, who acted as abbots. Under their rule the now Protestant community began a school in 1544.
After the death of the last count in 1599, Blankenburg and its possessions, including Michaelstein Abbey, came to the Duke of Brunswick, who appointed his brother Christian abbot of Michaelstein. He relinquished the position in 1624, after which the Dukes instead appointed Protestant theologians.
From 1629 to 1631 and from 1636 to 1640, during the Thirty Years' War, short-lived communities of Cistercian monks again occupied the monastery.
In 1690 Michaelstein passed into the possession of the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Under abbot Eberhard Finen a seminary for Protestant preachers was established in 1717, which operated alongside the school until 1721, when the school was closed, leaving the abbey as a seminary and a Protestant men's collegiate foundation. At this period substantial building works were carried out, including the conversion of part of the west wing as a Baroque church.
In 1808, under French occupation, the abbey was closed down. Thereafter the buildings were used only for farming purposes, largely the accommodation of farm workers, and so began many years of deterioration.
Stiftung Kloster Michaelstein.
In 1945, as part of the land reforms of the Communist government of East Germany, the abbey estates were split up and redistributed. Some Work on the abbeys buildings took place from 1956, but it was in 1968 that the main restoration scheme began, on the initiative of the Telemann Chamber Orchestra and its director Dr. Eitelfriedrich Thom. In 1977 was founded the culture and research facility that formed the basis of the later "Institut für Aufführungspraxis der Musik des 18ten Jahrhunderts" ("Institute for the Performance of the Music of the 18th Century").
In 1988 a museum was created, with a collection of predominantly historical musical instruments. In the same year a group was formed from among the musicians of the Telemann Chamber Orchestra who played on historical musical instruments as the "Barockensemble des Telemann-Kammerorchesters". 
In 1995, for lack of funds, the full Telemann Chamber Orchestra was wound up, but the Baroque Ensemble continued, playing on historical instruments, and took over the name of the Telemann Chamber Orchestra. In 1997 the Institute was changed into the "Stiftung Kloster Michaelstein - Musikinstitut für Aufführungspraxis". From 2001 the "Landesmusikakademie" of Sachsen-Anhalt has also been based here.
From 2000 the orchestra was gradually separated from the Institute and urged towards independence. Some time afterwards there was a split between the musicians: one part continues to play on historical instruments as the "Telemannisches Collegium Musicum", while the other part, under the leadership of the widow of Dr. Eitelfriedrich Thom, continues under the old name as the "Telemann-Kammerorchester", but without any connection to Michaelstein Abbey.
The former monastic buildings, now accommodating both the Foundation ("Stiftung") and the Sachsen-Anhalt Music Academy ("Landesmusikakademie Sachsen-Anhalt"), host various musical events, particularly the series of concerts known as the "Michaelsteiner Klosterkonzerte", often featuring the Michaelstein Chamber Choir ("Kammerchor Michaelstein") and the Telemanisches Collegium Michaelstein Orchestra. Guided tours of the abbey complex, including the herb- and vegetable gardens, laid out according to historical sources, and of the musical instrument display, are conducted throughout the year. A music library is located in the west wing, and is often accessible to the public. A highlight of the year is the annual Michaelstein Abbey Festival ("Michaelsteiner Klosterfest").
In addition the Foundation organises conferences and seminars at a European level and supports ongoing research.
Other structures.
In the external wall of the Baroque church created in the west wing of the surviving monastery precinct, are immured the remains of Beatrice of Gandersheim (d. 1061), daughter of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, and abbess of Gandersheim and Quedlinburg. Formerly buried at Quedlinburg Abbey, Beatrice's remains were displaced after the church there burnt down in 1070, and were apparently finally laid to rest in Michaelstein in the 1160s.
The nearby "Mönchemühle" ("monks' mill") on the Goldbach brook was once the monastery's oil mill.

Political foundation at European level

A European political foundation, formally a political foundation at European level, informally a Eurofoundation, is a research and advocacy organization close to, but independent from a Europarty. They are funded by the European Parliament. Their purpose is to act as platforms aiming at developing forward-looking ideas and concepts for their respective political family and providing a forum where those ideas can be widely debated. There are nine Eurofoundations as of 16 March 2009.
Timeline.
2003.
Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 defined what a Europarty, or "political party at European level", was and tightened up their regulation.
2007.
That regulation was later heavily amended by Regulation (EC) No 1524/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2007. That amendment provided for the earlier-floated concept of a political foundation at European level, a legally separate affiliate to an Europarty created to help them disseminate their principles to a wider audience.
An initial €1 million was allocated for pilot proposals, and Call For Proposals DG/EAC/29/2007 went out with a deadline of 28 September 2007. Ten organizations were picked (one for each Europarty) and money was allocated with an expiry date of 31 August 2008.
Regulations.
As of 1 November 2008, the regulation governing Eurofoundations is Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003, as later amended under codecision (see above). That regulation's European Commission factsheet is given here.
Funding.
Their total allocated funding for 2008 is €5 million.
The Eurofoundations.
Ten pilot Eurofoundations were set up in 2007/8, nine of which are still in existence as of 16 March 2009. They are as follows:
Proposed Eurofoundations.
It was reported on 1 November 2008 that Declan Ganley had registered a company in Dublin called the "Libertas Foundation Ltd" and that it was intended to "to act as a European Political Foundation for the Libertas Party". Ganley attempted to get EU recognition and funding of €111,000 for the "Libertas Foundation" in February 2009, but the attempt was rejected because its board members were all from one member state and the foundation name was the same as the aspirant Europarty also founded by Ganley. The same meeting of the Bureau of the European Parliament that rejected the Libertas foundation but (momentarily) recognised the Libertas party also defunded the "Alliance of Independent Democrats in Europe" (AIDE).
The foundation affiliated to the newly created Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists is New Direction.

Giant deities

In many campaign settings for the "Dungeons & Dragons" fantasy role-playing game, the giantish pantheon of gods consists of the leader, Annam, as well as Diancastra, Grolantor, Hiatea, Iallanis, Karontor, Memnor, Skoraeus Stonebones, and Stronmaus. Other powers worshiped by giants or giant-type creatures include Baphomet, Kostchtchie, and Vaprak.
Annam.
Annam is the giant deity of Magic, Knowledge, Fertility, and Philosophy. Also known as the All-Father, is the creator god of the giant pantheon. His symbol is a pair of crossed hands, held palms together with their fingers facing downward. Annam takes the form of a 60' or 100+' tall giant with white hair, wearing a robe of midnight blue.
Annam fathered the gods Stronmaus, Grolantor, Iallanis, and Skoraeus Stonebones on an unnamed sky goddess. Surtr, the dead goddess Shax, Diancastra, Hiatea, Thyrm, and Karontor are also said to be his children, but perhaps with different wives or concubines. Memnor is sometimes said to be his son with the sky goddess, and other times said to be his brother, or the spawn of a world-devouring monster that Annam or Stronmaus destroyed. An enormous, hideous ogress is said to have seduced Annam, with Vaprak as the result. Annam’s "Hidden Realm" is on the plane of the Outlands. He originally lived in Ysgard, in a realm called "Gudheim". Annam is worshipped by almost all giants, who see him as the greatest example of their own subspecies, personifying the traits that they value the most. To hill giants, he is an enormous glutton; to stone giants, he is the greatest of artists. To frost giants, he is a mighty warrior and reveler.
Annam came across the planet of Abeir-Toril at a time before the existence of dwarves, elves and humans. He met and married Othea who took the form of a mountain on the edge of the Cold Lands. They had children, who were not Annam's first (he had previously had immortal children), but they were Annam's first terrestrial children. His favourite sons were Lanaxis, Masud, Nicias, Obadai, Ottar, Ruk and Vilmos, who all went on to form one of the main giant species, and his two-headed son, Arno and Julian, went on to become ettin, meaning "runt". He also believed that Dunmore was his son, but this was not the case: Dunmore's father was Ulutiu.
Annam discovered that his wife was having an affair with Ulutiu and killed Ulutiu as a result. He wanted to have another child who would be able to rebuild his kingdom of Ostoria after the war with the dragons, but Othea was so upset by the death of Ulutiu that she refused. Annam tricked her to get her pregnant, and the pair reached a compromise whereby the child would be allowed to live if Annam agreed to leave Toril until it called his name.
It's unclear how Ulutiu returned to life, but he made a deal with Annam whereby the giant god would spare Othea in exchange for Ulutiu's voluntary exile. Ulutiu sank into the Cold Ocean with his necklace; the sea flash-froze into the Great Glacier. Othea planned to reunite with Ulutiu but was murdered for her adultery by one of her sons, who for reasons unknown to mortals could not venture onto the ice while his mother lived. The dwarf war god Clangeddin Silverbeard famously believes the only good giant deity is a dead giant deity. Annam is more or less forced to oppose Clangeddin by default.
Annam first appears in the 2nd edition book "Monster Mythology" (1992). His role in the giant pantheon of the Forgotten Realms setting is detailed in "Giantcraft" (1995). His role in the cosmology of the Planescape campaign setting was described in "On Hallowed Ground" (1996). Annam appears in 3rd edition in "Defenders of the Faith" (2000). His priesthood is detailed for this edition in "Complete Divine" (2004). His role in the Forgotten Realms setting is revisited in "Faiths and Pantheons" (2002).
Diancastra.
Diancastra is the trickster-goddess of the giant pantheon. Her symbol is a sea-green streak, which is based on the mysterious mark she bears on her shoulder.
Her rank is given in "Monster Mythology" as "heroine/demigoddess," which is the same given for the hero-goddess Zinzerena.
Diancastra has many faces and wiles, from a , slender elven maid to a giant. Two traits remain constant in all her forms: her green-flecked amber eyes and the streak of sea-green skin along her left shoulderblade. She is sometimes accompanied by a magical owl.
Diancastra is both impudent and arrogant. She often defeats her enemies by taunting them until they are enraged beyond reason, and then ensnaring them in illusions. She enjoys worldly pleasures and drinks to excess. She can charm people, especially males, merely by gazing at them. She casts elemental spells as an 18th level wizard. She can walk on water and her skin has an automatically renewing "stoneskin" effect.
Diancastra is the daughter of the creator god Annam and a mortal giant, most probably of the storm giant or cloud giant breeds. Like her half-sister Hiatea, she won divinity from her father through great deeds, but she did so through wit and guile rather than heroic feats in battle. Her father demanded that she circle the Oerth in an hour or less, and she did so by tearing a picture of the world from one of Stronmaus's atlases, walking around the image instead. Some believe the only reason Annam accepted this trick was that he believed that his only way back from his despair and ennui would be Diancastra and her wit and humor.
Her other half-siblings include Grolantor, Iallanis, Karontor, Skoraeus Stonebones, Stronmaus, Surtr, and Thrym. Memnor and Vaprak are also sometimes named as her relatives.
Diancastra's adventures and misadventures are long and storied. She has stolen a magic necklace from Blibdoolpoolp, snitched spellbooks from a demigod servitor of Surtr, won a drinking contest at the Seelie Court (who trained her as a bard), and solved the puzzles of Lyzandred. She has been the lover of Deep Sashelas, who gave her a sea-green mark and the ability to breathe in water. She often takes on lovers for the things they can teach or give her.
Diancastra is a wandering deity, calling no plane her home for long. She lives by her wits, solving riddles, making grim sages laugh. She searches for knowledge of illusions, bardic magic, obscure legends and lore, and handsome men.
Worshipers.
Diancastra is slowly becoming recognized as a minor fertility deity among non-evil giants, who invoke her name if they wish their romances to be blessed with children. The result is often children, called by the ominous name "Diancastra's brood," as cheeky and willful as Diancastra herself. Her cult is still very small, however, and she has no priests or shamans as yet.
Grolantor.
Grolantor is the deity worshiped by the hill giant race, as well as ettins, and some frost giants and ogres. His sacred animal is the dire wolf. His holy symbol is a wooden club.
Grolantor looks like a hill giant, wearing several belts of woven dwarf beards. He wields an oversized club named "Dwarfcrusher".
Grolantor is one of the third generation of giant gods, disdainfully called the "runts" by their elders - the other is Karontor. His mother is an unnamed sky goddess. He was banished to Carceri by his father Annam for allying himself with treacherous Memnor, but now that Annam has retreated from the rest of the multiverse, the ban no longer applies. He now splits his time between Carceri and the Abyss.
Grolantor is evil second and stupid first, disowned by his brothers for his foolishness and relative weakness. Some say he created the race of hill giants by collecting and interbreeding the runts of earlier giant broods, then further polluted this stock by mating with various serpents, medusa-like hags, and the goddess Cegilune. The ettins are said to have descended from Grolantor and a monstrous serpent with a head on both ends of her coiled body.
The god has had to flee the wrath of his sister Hiatea on many occasions. He also has many enemies among the goblinoid and dwarven deities.
Grolantor's realm in Cathrys, the second layer of Carceri, is called the Steading. The orbs above his realm are ruled by shator demodands, a weak-willed, toadying lot that cede to him their vassalage, more out of fear of the giant petitioners that make up the armies of Grolantor than out of any love for the hill giant god. His realm itself is little more than a wooden house.
Worshipers.
Grolantor is worshiped by hill giants, ettins, and some frost giants and ogres.
Grolantor is strong and willfully stupid. He teaches his followers to persecute "lesser races" - that is, those smaller than hill giants. His hill giant shamans stubbornly refuse to admit they are smaller than any other giant breeds.
Ettins worship Grolantor in a dual-aspected manner, and their dogma differs from that of the hill giants in many crucial respects, often preventing alliances between the two races.
The most important thing for a follower of Grolantor is to never admit weakness, and to crush the weak.
Grolantor's priests wear dark brown armor made from horn, and adorn their heads with skulls. They regularly organize hunting parties and skirmishing warbands, and take it upon themselves to root out what they perceive as weakness among their kind and elsewhere. They are not permitted to ever back down from a challenge. Grolantor's favored weapon is the club.
Grolantor has no particular holy days, and is unusual among evil deities in that he demands no sacrifices. The closest thing to formal ritual among his worshipers is eating and drinking contests.
Creative origins.
Grolantor was created by James M. Ward for the "Deities and Demigods Cyclopedia" (1980).
Hiatea.
Hiatea is the giant deity of nature, agriculture, hunting, females, and children. Her symbol is a flaming spear. She takes the form of a tanned, lithe giantess with long legs, wearing leather armor and carrying a spear that flames on her command, a bow, and a quiver of arrows. Her hair is red-golden, and her large eyes are hazel-brown. She is sometimes said to have used her spear to slay an enormous hydra, preventing its heads from regenerating by cauterizing them with fire. She is strong, confident, and an exceptional hunter.
Hiatea has two aspects. From her firbolg upbringing, she has an affinity for community, agriculture, and family. Once she discovered her true patrimony (another myth said it was due to Stronmaus' teasing), she reinvented herself as a mighty hunter and protector.
Hiatea is a daughter of Annam. Her mother was an unnamed sky goddess or, according to some myths, a mortal giant. Annam originally preferred sons over daughters, and used magic to ensure the gender of his offspring was male. Hiatea's mother hid her pregnancy from Annam and had her daughter raised by firbolgs so that Annam would never learn of her existence. When she came of age, a messenger was sent from her mother's deathbed to tell Hiatea of her true parentage. Hiatea proved herself with a series of daring feats, cumulating in an epic battle with a great monster, sometimes named as a Lernaean hydra with fifty heads and sometimes as the Tarrasque. She brought a trophy of her kill to her father, who recognized her valor and worth, accepting her as one of his own offspring. Upon learning of her existence, her brother Stronmaus celebrated by creating mighty storms that flooded the worlds and washed away great evils.
Hiatea's other siblings or half-siblings include Skoraeus Stonebones, Surtr, Thrym, Grolantor, Karontor, Iallanis, Diancastra, and possibly Vaprak and Memnor.
Because of her patronage of the wood giants, Hiatea she has begun to develop real friendships with some of the elven deities, notably Solonor Thelandira, whom she often engages with in archery contests.
Hiatea lives in "Woodhaven" on the wild, rugged layer of "Eronia" on the plane of Elysium. She often journeys to the Beastlands on hunting expeditions, impressing all who dwell there.
Worshipers.
Hiatea is worshipped by giants of all species, especially females. Firbolgs and voadkyn (wood giants) of both genders are particularly fond of Hiatea, and consider her to be their special patron.
Hiatea teaches that Nature is both creator and destroyer, and that admitting defeat is the worst shame a giant can bear. Still, some prices are too high to pay even for victory, for Hiatea is a goddess with tendencies toward good.
Hiatea's priests typically have one of two roles, although the boundary between the two can occasionally be fuzzy. There are the community priests ("priests of the steadings") who tend to agriculture and the raising, protection, and education of children; there are also the protector (or sentinel) priests who patrol woodlands and forests and keeping an eye on other races. Her voadkyn protector priests go out of their way to maintain relations with the wood elves. Among the firbolg, female clerics may be somewhat more numerous than male ones, though males and females are considered of equal merit in all of Hiatea's sects. The highest priests of Hiatea belong to no community, visiting the giant steadings only to issue orders to the priests of the community.
Hiatea communicates frequently with her priests and shamans, sending omens in the form of distinctive shapes in the fires, or in flaming spheres within dying embers. Her community priests may see omens in the dreams of children. She may also send omens in the form of a gigantic (2-foot wingspan) yellow-gold moth that will spiral around flame. Her priests perceive messages in its path of flight. Those who capture the moth alive will be invisible in woodlands for days.
All of Hiatea's clerics must be capable of surviving and hunting in the wilderness. Those who lose this ability due to age, injury, or other ailment must retire.
Hiatea's favored weapon is the spear.
Once a month or so, the community priests accompany the sentinel priests and the faithful on a ceremonial hunt. Once a year, usually in the spring, they select a particularly challenging creature to kill.
Making family decisions without consulting a community priest of Hiatea is considered a minor sin by the faithful. 
Iallanis.
Iallanis is the giant deity of love, mercy, and beauty. Her symbol is a garland of flowers. She appears as a graceful giant, 25' in height with fair skin. She wears a short green dress from which grows living flowers. She is always bare-legged and bare-footed.
Iallanis is a daughter of Annam and the younger sister of Hiatea. She is an ally of the swanmay goddess Fionnghuala. Her other siblings and half-siblings include Diancastra, Grolantor, Karontor, Shax, Skoraeus Stonebones, Stronmaus, Surtr, and Thrym. Memnor and Vaprak are also sometimes named as her relatives. Beautiful, loving Iallanis is one of her father's favorite children.
Iallanis has a realm called "Florallium", which can be found on Arborea. Florallium is a place of quiet gardens and crystal springs. It is a neutral place where terms of peace can be arranged. It is said that when the Seldarine drove the other giant gods out of the plane they allowed Iallanis to remain, as she stayed by the hearth instead of fighting. They don't respect her, though, as they do her warlike brothers and sisters.
Worshipers.
Iallanis has worshipers among the cloud giants, stone giants, storm giants, firbolgs, and voadkyn.
Iallanis teaches that mercy is to be honored above all else, save the gods themselves. Beauty is to be honored above all else save the gods and mercy. Punishment will naturally come to those who do evil and rewards will naturally come to those who do good. "Kindness is the milk of might; passion is the milk of life."
Iallanis will accept any good-aligned true giant into her priesthood, treating every race as equal to the others. She would treat giant-kin such as firbolgs, fomorians, verbeegs, and voadkyn as equals as well, but this was forbidden by her father; thus, they are limited to places of lower status in her clerical hierarchy. Her clerics strive to bring the whole of giantkind into the ways of good, to show mercy to all, and to cooperate with other good creatures. Her clerics and shamans are expected to become happily married if they are to attain high rank. She sends omens to her priests in the form of floral scents, tinkling sounds, and similar gentle, pleasant events.
Clerics of Iallanis concentrate on uniting the races of giantkind, bringing mercy and absolution to those who need it, and creating beautiful things. They forgo worldly possessions beyond those they require to do their duties.
Clerics of Iallanis say prayers over every gift or meal they receive. They conduct nearly all marriage ceremonies among the giants, even those involving evil giants and priests of evil deities.
Every year, on the first day of Growfest, Iallanis's priests assemble for a grand revelry. If possible, one or more marriages are performed at the climax of the event.
Karontor.
Karontor is the giant deity of deformity, hatred, and beasts. His symbol is the head of a winter wolf. He manifests as a uniquely hideous fomorian giant dressed in rotting, stinking furs and wielding a club. He may also appear as a winter wolf.
Karontor, like his brother Grolantor, is one of the third generation of the giant pantheon, one of the so-called "runts." He is far more evil than his brother, and far more intelligent.
Karontor dwells in a mausoleum of beast and giantish bones in Minethys, the third layer of Carceri, which he calls the "Rack of Injustice." He is served by petitioners and by a pack of ever-hungry winter wolves. He was banished to Carceri by Annam, who wearied of the endless fights between his sons and found Karontor the easiest to rid himself of.
Karontor despises giantkind; this reflects his own deep self-loathing. He spends much of his time in introverted self-reflection, sending avatars to kill and destroy during his infrequent fits of rage.
Worshipers.
Karontor is worshipped by many fomorian and verbeeg giants, as well as other giants considered deformed by most.
Karontor's priests are encouraged to kill good creatures, using trained beasts (especially wolves) for this purpose. They urge their followers to war and conflict.
Myths and legends.
Some myths say that Karontor was once beautiful and shining, but his jealousy of Stronmaus caused him to twist into a form as hideous as his heart. As the corruption grew, he descended into the underworld where he learned dark secrets from an ancient race of subterranean hags. On his return, he used this magic to twist some of the fairest mortal giants into fomorians and verbeegs as hideous and corrupt as he is.
Memnor.
Memnor is the giant deity of pride, honor, mental prowess and control. His symbol is a thin black obelisk. He appears as a kindly, golden-skinned giant with piercing eyes, wearing a deep blue robe. He is subtle, intelligent, charming, cultured, articulate, and cruel beyond words. Many giants consider him to be a loyal servant of Annam, but this is a lie. Memnor, in his arrogance, wishes to usurp Annam and Stronmaus and become the new leader of the giantish pantheon.
Memnor is variously said to be the son, brother, or enemy of Annam, the giant god of creation. One myth says he was born from the severed head or ripped-out entrails of a titanic, sub-sentient, planet-eating monster slain by Annam or Stronmaus.
Memnor is allied with Grolantor. Of all the gods, Stronmaus is Memnor's greatest and most implacable foe.
Memnor's realm of "Thraotor" can be found on the plane of Gehenna. His realm is similar to that of Stronmaus in the Beastlands, a palace built atop a storm cloud, but where Stronmaus's palace is made of silvery marble, Memnor's is made of black adamantine.
Worshipers.
Memnor is worshiped almost exclusively by evil cloud giants, his chosen instruments in his bid for power. He corrupted them by telling them of their natural superiority, that they were the first-born of giantkind and that all other breeds are inferior.
Memnor teaches his followers that Annam has grown old and weak and that the fall of the ancient giant kingdoms was due to the creator god's own ineptitude. The sharpest weapon ever forged is cunning; used with surprise and secrecy, cunning will win the day.
Memnor's clerics consider keeping their true ambitions a secret to be their highest duty. After sworn into the priesthood by the cleric of Amman, they are visited by senior clerics of Memnor and initiated in a secret ceremony, where they pledge to aid their master to overthrow the god of creation and put the god of pride, honor, and mental prowess on the throne. Even their followers do not know this, viewing their deity as an honest god of racial honor and pride. Memnor's clerics also play the role of wise counselors and advocates for the underprivileged.
There is a special sign involving touching the left wrist with the index finger of the right hand that clerics of Memnor use to signal or warn one another, and several shades of meaning are possible through context and emphasis.
High-level clerics of Memnor receive wyvern servants from their god, which they summon by means of a fierce talon they wear in leather pouches around their necks.
Clerics of Memnor must be well-dressed and regal of manner. They proclaim the superiority of giants in general and cloud giants in particular.
Three times a year, Memnor's cleric hold feasts in which other giants are invited to attend. Among themselves, the clerics meet with Memnor's avatar and his wyvern servants on midnight every one hundred days. After these meetings, they gather their faithful cultists to discuss strategy and tactics.
Myths and legends.
Childhood games.
One myth tells of the childhood of the giant gods, when a malicious game played by Memnor and his brother Grolantor resulted in a minor war between the giants and ogres. As a result, Annam forbade either son from interfering with the affairs of giants and their kin as long as he ruled the pantheon. When Annam retreated, despairing, to the Outlands, Memnor and Grolantor managed to convince Stronmaus and Hiatea that this order was no longer valid. Since then, both have meddled incessantly.
Ancient war.
A rival myth has a more epic take, portraying Memnor as an extremely ancient and clearly evil deity, perhaps Annam's brother, who tried to take control of the giantish pantheon by force. Annam and Memnor battled, neither able to best the other, until finally Annam managed to banish Memnor to Gehenna. Annam himself, it is said, retreated to the Outlands in order to recover from his wounds.
Othea.
In the "Forgotten Realms" campaign setting, Othea is the mother of all giants, giant-kin and ogres according to the mythology of the "Dungeons & Dragons" fantasy role playing Game.
Skoraeus Stonebones.
Skoraeus Stonebones is the deity worshiped by the stone giant race. He is also known as "King of the Rock" and "The Living Rock". His sacred animal is the cave bear. His holy symbol is a stalactite. He manifests as a huge stone giant with muscular limbs and skin like granite. He knows much of the secret banes, magics, and wonders buried in the core of the world. Skoreaus regards both Law and Chaos with suspicion.
Skoreaus is part of the second generation of giantish gods, born at about the same time as Surtr and Thrym. It is said that his brothers' evil drove him to hide himself below the world and ignore everything apart from himself and his people. When he absolutely has to, he'll deal with the gods of the dwarves and svirfneblin. He is allied with Dumathoin, and has been occasionally known to consort with the gods of the svirfneblin.
Skoreaus is the son of Annam. His siblings and half-siblings include Diancastra, Grolantor, Hiatea, Iallanis, Karontor, Stronmaus, Surtr, and Thrym. Memnor and Vaprak are also sometimes named as his relatives.
Skoraeus has no permanent home, and wanders the Material Plane and Outer Planes. Skoraeus is sometimes said to dwell at the heart of the world, where he senses all that occurs while touching stone by feeling the vibrations that reach him. Skoraeus will never venture above ground, and cannot even be "gated" there.
Skoreaus cares for nothing except for that which directly concerns his people, the stone giants. Stone giants, as far as he is concerned, would be better off if they never came in contact with other races at all. Skoreaus teaches his followers that beauty is truth and knowledge is power; a secret is the ultimate power and the Underdark is filled with secrets.
Worshipers.
The reclusive Skoreaus is worshipped almost exclusively by stone giants, who may be found in mountains and caves in a variety of places in the Flanaess, including the Crystalmist Mountains and the Lortmils.
Skoraeus's priests wear stone gray vestments, and animal skins. They dominate stone giant society, creating an environment of stifling orthodoxy. They are grave, serious, folk, seeing it as their duty to advance their race and guarantee that stone giants continue to make ever-greating works of art and intellectual discoveries. They avoid, and teach their followers to avoid, even other races of giants, let alone other species. Their favored weapon is the warhammer. They are capable of seeing omens in the shapes and hues of rock and subterranean features, and spend much of their time meditating and creating elaborate sculptures and friezes.
Once every three months or so, priests of Skoreaus travel underground alone without food, returning four days later. They assure their followers that these expeditions are vision-quests in which Skoreaus supplies them with instructions in the form of omens and dreams.
Skoreaus's clerics force any stone giant, even those who have pledged allegiance to other deities, who violates their god's teachings to atone through meditation. 
Stronmaus.
Stronmaus (STRAWN-mawz) is the giant deity of sun, sky, weather, and joy. His symbol is a forked lightning bolt descending from a cloud that partly obscures the sun. His avatar appears as an enormous (up to 80' tall) giant with blue eyes and flowing auburn-red, wavy hair, wearing a simple gold-edged white robe. He is far more youthful and carefree than his father Annam. He is normally depicted smiling and reveling. He cannot help but smile, for the energy of life flows through him so strongly that it is hard not for him to express his continual exuberance. He revels in the storms he calls up and in the thunder that booms from his magical hammer.
Stronmaus has inherited some of his father's fickle lusts, and may send avatars simply to woo and seduce beautiful female giants.
Stronmaus is the eldest son of Annam and thus the default leader of the giantish pantheon since Annam's withdrawal, though he does not covet his father's power. He will happily defer to Annam the moment the creator god returns. Stronmaus' closest relationship is with his sister Hiatea; the two are commonly seen as a pair, the oldest and most powerful of Annam's children. His other siblings and half-siblings include Diancastra, Grolantor, Iallanis, Karontor, Skoraeus Stonebones, Surtr, and Thrym. Memnor and Vaprak are also sometimes named as his relatives.
Stronmaus often flies the skies of the Beastlands with Aerdrie Faenya and Remnis as companions. He is well-disposed toward the gods of the "asathalfinare", who include Syranita, Surminare, and Trishina, and may send avatars to help them in times of need. He is also an ally of his fellow god of lightning Muamman Duathal. Stronmaus despises Memnor above all others, and will send avatars to restrict the evil cloud giant god's activities.
Stronmaus lives in the realm of "Stormhold", which can be found in the Beastlands in the midnight layer of "Karasuthra", though it is believed by some to be attached to "Gudheim", Annam's former realm in Ysgard. Stronmaus travels the layers of the Beastlands freely, but keeps his fortress in Karasuthra because he appreciates the way the moon of the Beastlands, Noctos, reflects off his gold-adorned marble battlements.
Stronmaus, the sole greater deity known to inhabit the Beastlands, delights in soaring above the forests and savannas of the plane with his companions, the laughing, cloudlike mortai, booming his own laughter in time with theirs and creating powerful storms in celebration of life.
Stormhold itself is a mighty palace of marble adorned with gold, platinum, and gemstones rising from a truly storm cloud, guided by mortai who shoot quick lightning bolts at one another as a form of electric conversation. Within is a magical opal pool where Hiatea and Surminare often visit. This pool, potent with healing magics, appears only 100 feet long to those outside it, but infinite to those swimming in its waters. Communities of those souls who worshipped Stronmaus in life dwell throughout the cloud, forming camps and congregations and spending most of their existences in the open air.
Worshipers.
Stronmaus is the patron of storm giants and non-evil cloud giants, but he is worshipped as a sky and weather deity by giants of all races. To hill giants he is a mighty fisherman, to frost giants he is a bold sailor and explorer, and to the cloud giants he is a thundering god of storms.
Stronmaus's faith stresses the cleansing and redeeming effects of rain, and the joys of freedom. Cloud giants stress the epicurean merriment of the deity, while storm giants are a fatalistic, though passionate, folk who believe life is a test of will and that most actions are futile in the face of the great elemental forces.
Stronmaus's cloud giant clerics are skilled in the arts and music. They wear fine jewelry and keep large personal fortunes; the quality of jewelry and dress is a sign of rank. They are proud and organized, and believe in ridding the skies of evil creatures.
His storm giant shaman-priests are shabbily-dressed and ascetic. They must sit atop a cold, deserted peak for 100 days without food before they are accepted into the priesthood, and they remain solitary, dealing with the creatures of the sky or sea. They are visionaries, mystics, and meditators who treat each other as equals.
Priests of Stronmaus, regardless of their breed, always stop to pray during or immediately after a rainstorm or thunderstorm. They are forbidden to build fires, though they may warm themselves by fires built by others. Stronmaus's favored weapon is the warhammer.
Cloud giants who worship Stronmaus scatter handfuls of incense and spices to the winds every morning as soon as they wake. Twice every year or so, they declare a sacred sky hunt ("omjag" in the giant tongue) to battle evil sky creatures such as chimeras, wyverns, and chromatic dragons. The slain beast is then ritually offered to Stronmaus.
Storm giant worshipers of Stronmaus organize ceremonies designed to demonstrate their ability to overcome earthly obstacles, testing their limits and placing them in great mortal danger. They also atone for their sins through such punishing rites as flagellation. 
Surtr.
Surtr is the lord of the fire giants. His animal is the hell hound. His symbol is a flaming sword. Surtr looks like an immensely large fire giant with crackling flames for hair and eyebrows. He wears armor of blazingly hot iron and wields a flaming iron sword 15 feet in length.
Surtr, a son of Annam, is part of the second generation of giantish deities, born at about the same time as Skoraeus Stonebones and Thrym. While Surtr's cult is similar to that of Thrym's, fire and ice do not mix.
Surtr rules "Muspelheim", an ever-burning realm on the fiery second layer of the plane of Ysgard; the layer is also called Muspelheim, named for Surtr's realm. Surtr's domain contains portals to the City of Brass and to an efreeti outpost called the "Suhkteh Albarrana" where fire giants often hire themselves as mercenaries to the genies of flame. The realm of Muspelheim can also be reached through certain volcanic regions on the first layer of the plane.
At the highest point in the earthberg upon which Surtr has built his realm is a range of mountains called the Serpent's Spine. The only liquid in the realm is the Lake of Lead, a body of molten metal where the fire giants drown their criminals. Other prominent sites include the town of Njarlok, a blacksmithing site called the Forges of Surtr, and the magical tower of stone known as Surtr's Spire.
Worshipers.
Nearly all of Surtr's worshipers are giants, but a select few members of other races have earned his approval. They conceal their devotion to the giant destined to end the world.
Surtr teaches that fire is pure, cleansing, and strong. The weak and impure burn, while the strong survive. Fire is useful as a tool, but must be respected. It is dangerous when uncontrolled.
Fire giant priests are normally architects or smiths. Those few who aren't are charged with the responsibility of keeping the rest of the tribe productive, largely by recounting inspirational tales.
Clerics of Surtr wear war helms and iron plate. Their color is fiery red, and Surtr's favored weapon is the greatsword.
Surtr's temples in the lands of men are hidden affairs. Those that are not hidden are huge buildings ringing with the sounds of forges and storing weapons in preparation for the battle at the end of the world. Visitors have only a few seconds to prove their intentions before the fire giants attack. Fire giants do not enjoy leaving witnesses to their activities.
The holy day of Surtr is the Summer Solstice. Surtr does not demand sacrifice or propitiation.
Myths and legends.
Ragnarok.
At Ragnarok, the battle at the end of the world, Surtr is destined to set the world on fire, burning it to ashes to make way for the new world to come. He will destroy Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, beneath his weight and that of his subjects.
Creative origins.
In Norse mythology, Surtr (modern Icelandic Surtur, sometimes Anglicized Surt) is the leader of the fire giants in the south, the ruler of Muspelheim, the realm of fire. His name means "Swart" or Black, and at the end of the world, Ragnarok, his hordes will rush north like a south wind to overwhelm the gods.
In Snorri Sturluson's Edda (1179–1241): "Surtur is the one so named who stands on Múspell's border, guarding the land. His sword is flaming and as the world ends he will go out, make war against and triumph over the gods. And he will burn the whole world with fire" (Gimlé Gylfaginning, iv). Only Hodmimir's Forest will remain, because that is the only thing his sword can not destroy. He will kill the unarmed god Freyr as well.
In the final battle, Surtr and his Fire-Giants burst forth: "In Surtur's grasp the Sword of Revenge blazes, adding a blood red colour to the twilight of the whole world."
Thrym.
In the "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game, Thrym is the lord of the frost giants. He is a god of cold and ice, as well as a deity of magic. Thrym is a hulking menace, appearing as a mighty frost giant with white eyes, blue hair, and a constant snarl. He can plunge any part of the Prime Material Plane into a state of extreme cold. His animal is the white dragon. His holy symbol is a white, double-bladed greataxe. Like Surtr and Skoraeus Stonebones, Thrym is part of the second generation of giantish deities. Although Surtr's cult is similar to Thrym's, fire and ice do not mix. Thrym is credited with creating the first minotaur from the vestige Haagenti, and with creating the first icebergs during his battle with his sister Shax.
Thrym was first detailed in "Deities and Demigods" (1980). Thrym was detailed in the 2nd edition "AD&D" book "Legends & Lore" (1992), including details about his priesthood. His role in the cosmology of the Planescape campaign setting was described in "On Hallowed Ground" (1996). His role in the giant pantheon of the Forgotten Realms setting is detailed in "Giantcraft" (1995). Thrym was described briefly in "Defenders of the Faith" (2000). He was detailed in the third edition version of "Deities and Demigods" (2002). His priesthood is detailed for 3rd edition in "Complete Divine" (2004).
Vaprak.
Vaprak is the deity worshiped by ogres and trolls. Vaprak is also known as "The Destroyer." His symbol is a taloned hand.
Vaprak has a humanoid form colored an exceedingly horrid mottled brown and green. He has an elemental, savage quality that endears him to ogres and trolls. Vaprak holds the other giantish gods in awe and respect, however, and fears that his race may abandon him to worship them. He is not a planner or a thinker; he merely destroys, ferociously, as quickly as he can, urging his followers to do the same.
Vaprak is an enemy of the giant pantheon led by Annam. One legend says that a vastly tall, hideous ogress disguised herself in order to seduce Annam, and that Vaprak was the result of this deceitful coupling. Vaprak himself has three sons: Anori (or Agmori), Hakuni, and Muaj, who are believed to have sired the three races of ogre magi.
Vaprak makes his home in "Shatterstone", the 524th layer of the Abyss. There, he dwells in a pitiful cave at the base of a great cliff.
Worshippers.
Vaprak is worshipped chiefly by ogres and trolls.
Vaprak urges his followers to combat, aggression, and frenzy; his own fears help fuel his anxiousness that they keep themselves busy.
Vaprak's priests wear blood red plate mail and war helms. They must be ferocious and constantly on the look out for opportunities to fight. They must devour all they can, but remain physically fit. They often exercise by ritually bashing one another with clubs, which helps determine rank in their violent society. Vaprak's favored weapon is the greatclub.
Vaprak is worshiped in the lairs and dens of ogres and trolls.
One curious rite practiced among the ogres of one tribe is the "Six Day Night," where ambitious tribesmen demonstrate their loyalty to Vaprak and their tribal leader by being placed in a dark cavern for six days with no food and only a small amount of water. If the initiate survives this ordeal, his status is greatly increased.
Creative origins.
Vaprak was created by James M. Ward for "Deities and Demigods" (1980).

Resettlement (Newfoundland)

Resettlement in Newfoundland and Labrador terms was an organized approach to centralize the population into growth areas. Three attempts of resettlement were thrust upon outport residents and whole communities between 1954 and 1975 which resulted in the abandonment of 300 communities and nearly 30,000 people moved. Government's attempt of resettlement has been viewed as one of the most controversial government programs of the post-Confederation Newfoundland and Labrador.
Background.
The history and commerce of Newfoundland and Labrador was built on the fishery and in doing so many communities were established in just about every bay and small cove throughout the entire coastal region. Some of these communities were seasonal fishing stations and some eventually grew into communities which were very much isolated from much of the country except for water transportation or overland hiking trails.
In the early twentieth century settlement patterns and population distribution were changing due to a number of factors. People were already moving to larger centres such as St. John's. For example in 1874 the population of St. John's was 30,574 and the major Conception Bay districts had a combined population of 41,368. By 1935 the population of the Conception Bay districts had increased by just over 4,500 people, while the population of St. John's had more than doubled to 65,256 people.
Other parts of the island and Labrador were going through major changes in resource development that affected areas outside the Avalon Peninsula. The construction of paper mills in both Grand Falls and Corner Brook drew many people from coastal towns and villages. These areas contributed to growth in other areas such as Botwood and Deer Lake. Mineral discoveries at places such as Wabush and Labrador City, St. Lawrence, Baie Verte and Buchans also contributed to the movement of people away from the outports. World War II also had a part to play when air force bases were built at Stephenville, Argentia and Goose Bay.
Prior to 1954.
Prior to the start of the government sponsored resettlement program many communities were abandoned for various reasons including disease, lack of work and natural disaster. One of the earliest examples of this is the community of Garia. The community lost 3/4 of its inhabitants after they decided to move to Anticosti Island for work in 1873. The remaining residents slowly moved away and the community was abandoned in the 1910s. 
Between 1946 and 1954, it is estimated that 49 communities were abandoned without government intervention. Government officials had long petitioned for a greater concentration of the population, citing many benefits. In 1953 the Newfoundland Department of Welfare offered small amounts of financial assistance to residents of 110 communities to accelerate the process which had come naturally. This became the beginning of the government assisted resettlement program for the province.
Labrador on a much smaller scale was experiencing a resettlement when the Moravian Church in the northern part of Labrador was relocating the Inuit to centres such as Hebron and Nain. Dr. Wilfred Grenfell, in his efforts to provide health and educational benefits to the people of southern Labrador and the northern coast of the Great Northern Peninsula, also helped to the centralization of populations in areas such as St. Anthony and Charlottetown.
First Resettlement Program (1954-1965).
In 1954 the provincial Department of Welfare introduced a program to encourage residents of small coastal communities to move to larger "growth centers". Originally the government would pay for the relocation of all of a families belongings as well as their house to the new community. This was changed to a cash payment of $150 per family at the start of the program and gradually increased to $600 per family by the end of the program. This was a significant amount of money as the annual income for a fisherman working in the inshore fishery was generally under $500 per year. In order for a community to be eligible for assistance every member would have to agree to relocate. By 1965 the program had helped resettle 115 communities with a combined population of 7500.
Second and Third Resettlement Programs (1965-1975).
In 1965 the provincial and federal governments partnered in a new resettlement program. The new program was administered by the Department of Fisheries. Under the new program the assistance was increased to $1000 per family plus $200 for each dependant in addition to moving costs. The proportion of residents who needed to agree to the move decreased to 90% and later to 80%. A second federal-provincial agreement was started in 1970, with responsibility being shared by the federal Department of Regional Economic Expansion (DREE) and the provincial Department of Community and Social Development. Between 1965 and 1975 some 148 communities were abandoned, involving the relocation of an additional 20,000 people. 
In art.
The social change caused by resettlement has appeared in some works of literature and music. The song "The Government Game" by the Newfoundland writer Al Pittman describes the issue, with lyrics such as "It's surely a sad sight, their movin' around,/ A-wishin they still lived by the cod-fishin' ground;/ But there's no goin' back now, there's nothing to gain,/ Now that they've played in the government game." The song "Out From St Leonards" also describes the resettlement, noting how residents left "with their houses in tow" by physically shipping buildings to their new homes.

The J.A. Sweeton Residence was built in 1950 in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. At , it is the smallest of the four Frank Lloyd Wright houses in New Jersey. This Usonian scheme house was constructed of concrete blocks and redwood plywood.
The Sweeton House is sheltered by a dramatically pitched roof that comes within four feet of the ground. An impressive cantilevered carport extending about from the house provides a dramatic visual element to the entrance. Wright loved the automobile but thought garages were a relic of the "livery-stable mind," according to his revised autobiography.

Bill Stall

William R. "Bill" Stall (February 21, 1937 – November 2, 2008) was a reporter and staff member of the "Los Angeles Times" who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 2004.
Biography.
Stall was born on February 21, 1937 in Philadelphia to parents Sidney J. and Helen R. Stall. He and his two siblings moved with his parents in 1942 to Big Horn, Wyoming to operate a small ranch. Stall's father worked part-time at the "Sheridan Press", later owning a weekly newspaper.
Stall majored in journalism at the University of Wyoming and was sports editor, and later covered city-county government, for "Laramie Daily Bulletin" while still in college. He also attended Northwestern University and Johns Hopkins University, and served in the National Guard. He was hired by the "Associated Press" in Cheyenne, Wyoming, later working as the AP's Reno correspondent before a move to the agency's Sacramento, California bureau, where he was bureau chief from 1966 to 1974.
He served in the administration of Governor Jerry Brown as press secretary and director of public affairs in 1975 and 1976. He was hired in 1976 by The "Los Angeles Times" reporting in the Metro section. He later covered energy policy and was assistant Metro editor before becoming a staff writer in the paper's Washington, D.C. bureau. He took a position as Washington bureau chief for the "Hartford Courant".
Stall was awarded the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for a series of editorials written in October, November and December 2003 on California's troubled state government. The Reinventing California editorials included "How the Engine Derailed", "Primed for Fiscal Overhaul", "Yank the 'For Sale' Sign", "A Legislature at War" and concluded with "Seize the Political Moment". The Pulitzer board noted that Stall's series of editorials "prescribed remedies and served as a model for addressing complex state issues."
Stall was also proud of a 2001 series of editorials he wrote supporting Senate Bill 221, a measure submitted by State Senator Sheila Kuehl that would require real estate developers of projects with 500 or more units to demonstrate that the homes would have access to a long-term water supply. A lobbyist for the East Bay Municipal Utility District said that Stall's editorials helped make the case for the legislation, overcoming opposition from the building industry. After ten years of unsuccessful efforts to pass such a bill, the proposal passed in the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis, making California the first state in the Western United States to enact such a law.
Stall died of complications from pulmonary disease on November 2, 2008 at his home in Sacramento, California. He had been in failing health much of the year.

Operation North

Operation North () was the code name assigned by the USSR Ministry of State Security to massive deportation of Jehovah's Witnesses and their families to Siberia in the Soviet Union on 1–2 April 1951.
Background.
There were almost no Jehovah's Witnesses in the Soviet Union until its annexation of the Baltic States, Western Belarus, Western Ukraine, Bessarabia, and Northern Bukovina; most of them were located in the Moldavian SSR and Ukrainian SSR. Jehovah's Witnesses came into the conflict with the Soviet power, primarily because of their refusal to join the military. Their teachings were soon regarded as anti-Soviet. Members of religious groups, mostly Jehovah's Witnesses, qualified as religious elements considered a potential danger for the communist regime. In November 1950, Viktor Abakumov reported an idea to Stalin about their deportation, and Stalin suggested to plan this for March–April 1951.
Implementation.
On February 19, 1951, Abakumov delivered a secret notice to Stalin, detailing plans for the deportations of Jehovah's Witnesses to Tomsk Oblast and Irkutsk Oblast. It said, in particular, that during 1947-1950, 1048 Jehovah's Witnesses leaders and activists had been arrested, 5 underground print houses had been uncovered, and large amounts of printed matter confiscated. The deportees were permitted to take a maximum of 150 kilograms of property; the remaining property was to be confiscated "to cover the obligations of the deportees before the state". Abakumov's notice listed the following planned numbers of deportees:
On March 3, 1951, the USSR Council of Ministers issued the corresponding decree (no. 667-339ss), followed by an order of the Ministry of State Security (no. 00193) of March 5, 1951. On March 24, the Moldavian SSR Council of Ministers issued the decree on the confiscation and selling of the property of the deportees. Operation North started at 4 a.m. on April 1, 1951, and round-ups ended on April 2. The deportees were classified as "special settlers". From the Moldavian SSR, there were 2,617 persons (723 families) deported on the night of March 31 to April 1, 1951. 
Amnesty and exculpation.
On September 30, 1965, a decree (no. 4020-1U) of the Presidium of the USSR Council of Ministers cancelled the "special settlement" restriction for members of the four deported religious groups and their family members. However, this decree signed by Anastas Mikoyan stated that there would be no compensation for the confiscated property, and that return to their previous places of residence was subject to the approval of the local administrations. Though released, Jehovah's Witnesses remained the subject of legal persecution due to their ideology classified as anti-Soviet. The organization was legalized in the Soviet Union in 1991. The deported and convicted Jehovah's Withesses (and other religion-related convicts) were rehabilitated as victims of Soviet political repressions by the "ukase" no. 378 of President of the Russian Federation of March 3, 1996, "On the Measures for Rehabilitation of the Priests and Believers who had become Victims of Unjustified Repressions" (О мерах по реабилитации священнослужителей и верующих, ставших жертвами необоснованных репрессий).

Reese Williams and Bianca Montgomery

Reese Williams and Bianca Montgomery are fictional characters and a lesbian couple from the ABC daytime drama "All My Children". Reese was portrayed by Tamara Braun, and Bianca was portrayed by Eden Riegel. On Internet message boards, the pairing is commonly referred to by the portmanteaus "Rianca" (for Reese and Bianca) and "Breese" (for Bianca and Reese). The couple debuted in October 2008 and is groundbreaking for featuring the first same-sex marriage proposal, as well as the first legal same-sex wedding and marriage, on an American soap opera. In addition, the pairing's family is the first onscreen family made up of same-sex parents in the history of American daytime television.
The couple's wedding took place on February 13, 2009. Though the wedding received praise for being the first on an American soap opera, it also received criticism. The couple's romance was the subject of controversy, from writing and development to fan dissatisfaction and creator commentary.
Background.
Writing and portrayals.
Eden Riegel was cast in 2000 as Bianca Montgomery, the lesbian daughter of Erica Kane. Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans. Through the web presence she created for herself during her web series "Imaginary Bitches", fans let her know how much they wanted her back on the show. "I definitely wanted to fulfill that desire if I could," she said. Riegel then let the show know she was willing to come back. "next thing I knew I got a call and they said, 'Okay, we've got something for you,'" she said. The story the "All My Children" writers came up with involved a new love interest for Bianca, Reese Williams, who would be portrayed by daytime alumni Tamara Braun. Riegel addressed specific reasons she made the return. "It was the storyline that got me excited," she said. "I always want to come back. I love "All My Children", and they’re my family. I barely need an excuse -- it’s usually just about timing." Riegel added that "this time it was the fact that they were going to have Bianca in a committed relationship". She stated, "It was very, very important to me, and I was so glad to hear that. In the context of that, there’s some pretty exciting story line plot points that I’m aware of that are dramatic and fun to play and enticing as an actress." In addition, Riegel was enthused about playing opposite Braun. "It means so much [that Braun was cast because it shows how committed "AMC" is to this pairing," Riegel said in an interview with "Soap Opera Weekly". "We're going to have some serious stuff to play- they aren't going to waste her talents."
After portraying Ava Vitali on the NBC soap opera "Days of our Lives", Tamara Braun did not expect to appear on another daytime drama so soon. "I didn't want to do another soap, I was ready to do other things," Braun said in an interview with "TV Guide". "But this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up." "All My Children" head writer Charles Pratt, Jr. was creating the role of Reese with Braun in mind when he offered her the role. The story he presented her convinced Braun to take the part. "his is a story that's groundbreaking and over due," Braun said. "Two female soap characters having a baby together is unprecedented. I wanted to be part of something that could have a strong and positive impact and help give same-sex couples their rightful place in the world of daytime drama."
Since coming out as a lesbian, Bianca's romantic entanglements have consisted of sexual confusion, unrequited love, bad timing, and betrayal, including a short-lived romance with Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska) and an on-but-mostly-off-screen romantic relationship with Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson). The pairing of Reese and Bianca finally allowed the character to be scripted into an on-screen committed relationship. The show had been criticized in the past for not giving Bianca a full-fledged on-screen romance. When asked by "The Advocate" if she felt Bianca's pairing with Reese, especially by bringing on a recognized name (Braun), would make a difference, Riegel replied, "I think there has to be a difference." She responded to the criticism about Bianca's lack of onscreen intimacy with past romantic partners. "I don’t know if the criticism is entirely warranted," she said. "I know I was glad that the show’s priority was in giving me good stories, and I thought that they did go further than anyone else had ever gone, so I always thought that they should be commended." Riegel added, however, that she knows the lack of onscreen intimacy between Bianca and the character's past romantic love interests left fans and herself unsatisfied. "She never really got to have the kind of relationship that she deserved," stated Riegel. Riegel said of Bianca's return this time, "you’ll see a couple of things you haven’t seen in a while".
The writers characterized Reese as "very warm and real and very expressive with her feelings". Her relationship with Bianca is also "very" affectionate. In the past whenever a kiss was written in for Bianca, significant soap opera press usually focused in on the moment as an event and another kiss usually took a year or longer to happen following the immediate shift of making her romance more physically reserved than heterosexual relationships on the show. The atmosphere was different for Reese and Bianca's relationship. Braun said in an interview with Shewired.com that she would not have been able to portray the character as well back then because Reese is so affectionate. "This character is warm and open and for me to play a woman who's in love, it's important for me to be able to express that," she said. "Perhaps that's one of the reasons they wanted me to play this." Braun and Riegel have portrayed their characters as in love and committed to each other. Reese was also scripted early on as the love of Bianca's life, negating Bianca's previous true love Maggie.
When asked how she felt Bianca and Maggie (BAM) fans would respond to the Reese and Bianca pairing, Riegel stated, "I'm pretty sure BAM fans will never be entirely satisfied until they have their two favorite girls together forever. But Lizzie's Hendrickson been so successful on "Y&R" Chloe Mitchell , and is so obviously happy there, I am hoping they are able to embrace this pairing for the time being."
Wardrobe.
For Reese and Bianca's wedding, the dresses of the brides were chosen to complement each other by featuring "a long, lean, Grecian flowy feeling". As Bianca, Riegel was dressed in a Monique Lhuillier one shoulder sari-inspired dress with gold beading. Her shoes were gold Aldos. Reese's dress was designed to fit her style as an architect. Her dress was designed by Andrew Gn. It was "a fit to flair" which featured center beading applique and the shoes she wore were off white.
The characters' family, including their daughter Gabrielle, were "dressed in the wedding's color palette: deep red." Haley Evans, who portrays the flower girl and Bianca's daughter Miranda Montgomery, wore a red velvet Lucy Sykes dress. Bianca's mother, Erica's red dress was designed by Gustavo Cadile.
Storyline.
Most of Bianca and Reese's relationship takes place offscreen in Paris, where they live with Bianca's daughter Miranda Montgomery. They decide they want to expand their family with another baby. Zach Slater comes to Paris and meets Reese. He agrees to be their sperm donor, and none of them tell Bianca's sister and Zach's wife, Kendall Hart Slater, for fear that she will say no. When Bianca is close to delivering her and Reese's baby, she returns to Pine Valley to tell Kendall. Before she can, a tornado hits and Kendall is injured. After an ambulance takes Kendall to the hospital, Bianca goes into labor and Zach helps her deliver their baby, a girl. Bianca and Zach later find out that Kendall is comatose. Bianca worries for Kendall but also fears how she would react to the news of Zach fathering her second child.
Reese comes to Pine Valley not long after the tornado with Miranda. She proposes marriage to Bianca, and Bianca accepts. Reese and Bianca decide to have a commitment ceremony in Pine Valley and to get married later in Paris, since gay marriage is not yet legal in Pennsylvania where Pine Valley is located. Those plans change as they plan to legally marry in Connecticut. They set their wedding date on Valentine's Day. Bianca's cousin, Greenlee Smythe, also plans to marry her former husband, Ryan Lavery, on that same day. The two couples arrange for a double wedding.
Bianca finds out that Reese was once engaged to a man and that she is Reese's first lesbian partner. She is hurt Reese did not tell her this. She also becomes increasingly insecure in their relationship as she sees her fiance getting closer with Zach. Bianca decides to test Reese's love for her. She tells Zach and Reese that she will be leaving town, but she secretly stays to spy on them. When Bianca witnesses Zach and Reese in an embrace as Zach gives Reese a kiss to the forehead, she believes Reese is cheating on her and flees. She ends up in a car accident soon afterward, but suffers no serious injuries. Zach and Reese rush to the hospital to see Bianca, and Bianca explains that she saw them embracing. She asks if they are in love. Zach and Reese say no. Despite this, Bianca is furious with Reese and does not want to talk with her. Reese frustratedly leaves the hospital and sends Bianca a note saying she plans to leave. After reading the note, Bianca hurries home to convince Reese to stay; she says that she loves her and knows that she is not romantically interested in Zach. Reese says that she would not have left, regardless.
Zach and Reese continue to bond, and Reese and Bianca continue planning their wedding. However, tragedy strikes when Kendall and Bianca's brother, Josh Madden, is killed by Zach after Josh has taken Reese and his family members hostage. Zach is determined to have Josh's heart be donated to Kendall, who needs a heart transplant to save her life. Erica, the siblings' mother, makes the painful decision to take Josh off life support and donate his heart to Kendall.
Kendall awakes from her coma days after her transplant. She is told of having been recently comatose, about her heart transplant, that Josh is dead and she has his heart, and of Bianca's engagement to Reese. Kendall is naturally overwhelmed by all the news, but handles it well. When she is told of Zach having fathered Bianca's second child, she seems numb to this news also. Her family had thought she would take this particular news badly, but Kendall seems okay with it. Greenlee (Kendall's best friend) and Erica, however, are the only ones to believe that Kendall is not okay with Zach being the father.
Kendall moves back home not long after being awake from her coma. Reese can sense that Kendall is uneasy with her and Bianca living there. She talks with Kendall alone, but it is apparent that Kendall is distant. After their conversation, Reese leaves the room and Zach comes in. Kendall tells Zach that she wants Reese and Bianca out of their home. Zach later obliges Kendall's wishes and sets Reese and Bianca up at his casino to stay. Reese and Bianca get into a fight while there, but later reconcile.
The day before Reese and Bianca's wedding, Kendall refuses to attend the ceremony. Zach tries to convince her to change her mind, saying that she is acting childish, but Kendall explains that he and Bianca betrayed her. Bianca receives word that Kendall will not be coming to her wedding and immediately rushes to Kendall's home to insist she attend. Kendall says that she will only come to the wedding as long as Bianca promises to leave for Paris soon afterward and take Reese and baby Gabrielle with her. Bianca reluctantly agrees. Later that night, Reese and Bianca have a wedding rehearsal. Kendall picks up a wine glass and makes a snarky toast to Reese and Bianca but particularly to Reese. Reese becomes upset; she grabs a bottle of wine, a glass, and walks off. Bianca follows her, but Reese wants to be alone. Zach later finds Reese and consoles her. He pulls her into a hug and then kisses her passionately; Reese kisses back. After a few moments, with Ryan having witnessed their kiss, unknown to them, they agree that the kiss never happened and that they already have people they are deeply in love with. Ryan later confronts Zach about the kiss, but Zach says it was nothing and nonchalantly walks away from Ryan.
On their wedding day, Reese and Bianca are blissfully happy before the ceremony. Bianca feels that maybe she should stay in Pine Valley. She later tells her mother this and says that she will stay, which Kendall overhears and subsequently decides not to attend the wedding after all.
Without Kendall, Reese and Bianca exchange wedding vows on February 12, 2009. Ryan, however, has called off his wedding with Greenlee after seeing Zach and Reese kiss. He tells Greenlee that he knows Zach and Reese have been sleeping together and that he does not want to be married next to them, but promises her that he will give her the wedding of her dreams. Greenlee then tries to get in touch with Zach; she wants to know if he has really been having an affair with Reese. When Greenlee cannot get in touch with Zach, she drives off on her motorcycle in search of him. Also on the road are Zach and Kendall in a car arguing. Kendall ends up in the wrong lane and nearly hits Greenlee. Both try to swerve out of the other's way, leaving Greenlee to drive off the road. When Greenlee's body is not found, she is presumed dead. Reese, Bianca and others soon find out about Greenlee being missing. Ryan tells Bianca that Zach and Reese have been engaging in a sexual relationship with each other. Bianca goes to Reese to tell her that their relationship and marriage is over. She later sends Reese annulment papers, and returns to Paris with Miranda and Gabrielle.
On April 24, 2009, Bianca comes back to Pine Valley after having discussed with Zach the reasons she left. After later talking over her and Reese's relationship problems with Zach and Kendall, the couple reconcile and hope that they can work their relationship out. They return to Paris together with their children, and later remarry. In 2010, Bianca returns to Pine Valley for a family emergency, and soon wants to stay. After Reese decides that she is not coming back to Pine Valley, Bianca decides to end their marriage for good and now is single.
Reception and impact.
First same-sex marriage and critical praise.
Reese and Bianca are the first same-sex couple to become engaged for marriage on an American soap opera. On October 31, 2008, AfterEllen.com founder Sarah Warn stated, "Bianca (Eden Riegel) and Reese's (Tamara Braun) much-anticipated engagement finally took place on ABC's daytime drama "All My Children" today (the first lesbian marriage proposal on daytime TV), and for once, the "AMC" writers didn't disappoint." In addition, the couple has been allowed the type of physical intimacy not previously allowed between same-sex couples within the series. Their kiss following the marriage proposal was seen as a change in the show's attitude about portraying homosexual relationships. "...They had an actual kiss — a real one, not a peck on the cheek," stated Warn. She added that the kiss was significant due to romantic kisses, explicit or otherwise, between two women on "All My Children" or on any daytime drama being rare.
Reese and Bianca's wedding on February 13, 2009 marked a first-time event for a daytime drama; the couple exchange vows in the first legal same-sex marriage in American daytime history. (Within the show, the wedding took place on February 12, 2009, Valentine's Day.) Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) president Neil G. Giuliano released a statement in honor of the milestone: 
In addition, "All My Children" was nominated for a GLAAD Award in January 2009. The wedding event was featured on CNN on February 16, 2009 following the continuation of the February 13, 2009 episode. The CNN report featured positive and negative thoughts about the wedding. "The View" discussed the wedding the following day, and relayed that angry letters had been sent to them about the wedding. Regardless of this, they applauded ABC for featuring the ceremony.
Criticism and controversy.
Gabrielle Montgomery.
In October 2008, with Bianca's return to the series during a series of tornadoes striking fictional town Pine Valley, Bianca was reported to be pregnant with her second child. Fans immediately began speculating on who the sperm donor was, which caught the attention of soap opera press, LGBT press, and other media outlets. "TV Guide" reported that "nobody knows in town until her brother-in-law finds her under the rubble". SOAPnet.com stated, "The physical affects [sic of the tornado are miniscule compared to the ripples Bianca’s presence creates." Another soap opera website sensationalized the story by stating, "When Bianca returns to town this time, she will have a brand new ‘someone special’ in her life and a big surprise — Bianca is pregnant! And wait until everyone finds out who the 'father' is."
Fans, aware that Miranda Montgomery, Bianca's first child, was the result of rapist Michael Cambias, speculated Zach Slater as the child's biological father. Zach was Michael's older brother. Fans theorized that Bianca wanted a baby closely related to Miranda and asked Zach to father the child. If Bianca were already pregnant when she got to Pine Valley, then Zach could have "donated" last time Bianca was in town, even though the timing within the series did not correlate with this. Another theory concluded Bianca’s former love Zarf/Zoe, a pre-op MTF transsexual, as the father; the argument arose over a website putting "father" in quotations. The "father" is really a "mother" trapped in a "father’s" body, the theory entailed.
Zach was eventually confirmed as the father of the child by magazine "Soap Opera Digest". Bianca's reasons for asking Zach to be the donor and doing so without informing her sister and Zach's wife, Kendall Hart Slater, infuriated viewers. They reasoned that neither Bianca nor Zach would do this to Kendall. After Ellen.com stated, "This storyline is all kinds of wrong — and not just because it makes website feel like need a shower. Bianca and Kendall have a strong, very close relationship." The website could not fathom that Bianca would make "a move like this" without discussing it with Kendall first. Bianca's reason, however, was that she did not want to give Kendall a chance to say no.
Bianca wanting her children closely related was seen by viewers as unneeded, since the children would still be closely related through Bianca. An AfterEllen.com editor relayed, "...Bianca wanting a baby closely related to Miranda, whose father was a rapist and whose grandfather was a mass murderer. I’m no geneticist, but propagating that DNA seems risky at best." The choice for Zach as the father makes Miranda and the new child not only half siblings but cousins as well, which some found "icky".
Reese being introduced as Bianca's love interest was the first time an American soap opera would showcase same-sex partners having decided to create a child together. Riegel set up the Reese and Bianca storyline and what the couple's introduction entailed to newspaper "New York Daily News". "Zach is looking for Kendall," she said. "He is shocked to find Bianca. Nobody knew she was coming to Pine Valley. Zach discovers Kendall's lifeless body and resuscitates her. Paramedics come, but they only have room in the vehicle for one person. Zach convinces them to take the kids, as well. He and Bianca wait." This gave the series a chance to explain Bianca's return to the audience, as they saw Bianca, clearly pregnant, sit beside Zach. "Zach agreed to be Bianca's donor, but she failed to tell him that the pregnancy took," explained Riegel. "The reason she was not forthcoming is that Kendall was not told. Bianca came halfway across the world from France in the Cambias private jet - the only jet that can fly into a tornado - and didn't even get to tell Kendall the truth."
The writers detailed Bianca and Zach talking only briefly before Bianca was seen going into labor. Zach delivers the baby, a girl. "If there's a giant storm, Bianca will give birth," joked Riegel, referring to how Bianca's first pregnancy (with Miranda) went. Riegel clarified that the baby "is actually" Reese and Bianca's, while Zach is the sperm donor. "After Zach delivers Bianca's baby," she said, "Reese tries to get to Pine Valley, but the roads are closed. She and Miranda fly to New York to surprise Bianca." Bianca's second child is soon named Gabrielle Montgomery, with Reese's blessing. Reese and Bianca are the first same-sex partners on an American soap opera to raise a family onscreen. Bianca had previously raised Miranda with character Maggie Stone, but the interaction takes place offscreen.
Romance, sexual confusion, and the wedding.
Viewers of the series noted what they considered "the many failings" of the Reese and Bianca love story. LGBT viewers were especially vocal about their discontent regarding the storyline. There were complaints that Reese was not "sufficiently integrated" into the Pine Valley canvas for the audience to invest in her relationship with Bianca, as well as complaints about the budding relationship between Reese and Bianca and their sperm donor Zach. The couple's wedding was heavily criticized. While there were viewers who felt that the wedding ceremony was a "joyous and celebratory" landmark, others were left feeling that the show missed an opportunity to make the union memorable when it cut to other story points during the wedding as Reese and Bianca exchanged vows.
Following Reese and Bianca's arrival to the series as a couple in October 2008, the writers started building a Zach and Reese friendship. To viewers, the friendship soon became somewhat sexual in nature in what they described as Reese "giving off a sexual vibe" whenever around Zach. This perception was intensified once Reese was revealed by the series to have been engaged to a man just a couple of months before becoming romantically involved with Bianca. Viewers who speculated Reese as bisexual suggested that she may be after Zach. The writers played this angle with ambiguity; they added in hug and kiss "teasers" such as Zach giving Reese a lingering peck on the cheek/neck.
Viewers became frustrated and angered by what seemed to be the writers situating a man into a lesbian love story, as well as Reese seeming to share more screentime and secrets with Zach than Bianca, and a lack of Reese and Bianca truly knowing each other. The audience had experienced sexual confusion storylines before with other former love interests of Bianca's, most notably Maggie, and were hoping that this love story would be without such confusion. At one point, Reese confesses to Zach her ambiguous feelings for him and asks him if he feels the same way for her just as "the phone and "[saves the day".
When asked by "The Advocate" in a February 12, 2009 interview about viewer concern among the LGBT community that Reese would leave Bianca for Zach and likely has romantic feelings for him, "All My Children" executive producer Julie Hanan Carruthers responded, "First of all, it’s not true. I think what’s confused in Reese’s head is she has misinterpreted a friendship. Zach is one of the people who have not kicked her to the curb, so to speak, in Pine Valley." Carruthers said that that Reese is a confused and insecure person. "She has never wavered in her commitment to Bianca," she said. "It’s solid, Reese has just had a lot of emotional stuff hit. Her family is rejecting and judging her... in both her family and Bianca’s." In specific response to viewers being upset at the appearance that Reese was considering leaving Bianca for Zach, Carruthers stated, "She is not considering it. That’s the audience rewriting what’s there. It’s not being written that way at all. Reese has never wavered in what she wants." Carruthers acknowledged that Reese leaving Bianca for a man would upset viewers, but that "it's never been about that". "I don’t know how to stress this more," she said. "Never has she played a moment of, 'I want Zach more than I want Bianca,' or 'I would leave Bianca for Zach.' He has literally just been a friend. Look, we tantalize in this genre. We do it whether we do it with heterosexual or homosexual couples. It’s what the genre is."
Despite Carruthers comments about the Zach and Reese relationship, Reese passionately engages in a kiss with Zach the same day of "The Advocate" February 12, 2009 interview, the night before Reese and Bianca's wedding. Carruthers explained, "The night before the wedding when Kendall, Zach’s wife, nails her with a backhanded toast, Reese gets a little drunk, and the person who consoles her is Zach." Carruthers described it as a moment where she kisses him and then realizes, "Oh, my god, what the heck am I doing? The person I love is Bianca, and the person you love is Kendall. What just happened?" That moment, said Carruthers, is what unravels Reese's world and "where someone tells somebody and it grows bigger than it ever was". 
In addition to viewers being upset by Reese's actions, AfterEllen.com was frustrated by Reese's ambiguous involvement with Zach and stated, "ABC touting the wedding as a 'historic daytime event' just ticks off". Carruthers said, "[Reese may not be the poster child to represent the lesbian women in the world. But at the same time, she is very responsible, as are the writers portraying a woman dealing with a crisis and trying to ground herself in her identity." She relayed that though Reese and Bianca would break up due to the Zach and Reese kiss, Bianca would return in the spring to give resolution to the story. "The journey Reese has to take to earn Bianca’s trust again is significant," said Carruthers.
On February 16, 2009, in response to the February 12, 2009 interview by "The Advocate", television program "Soap's Up" from Canada's A-Channel criticized Carruthers for insulting the audience's intelligence by saying that the audience had been rewriting the storyline. The program stated that while "it is good" for "All My Children" to feature a same-sex wedding, they have not been impressed by the love story and that a show's producer should have more control over the way a character behaves.
On February 27, 2009, Warn, who had previously praised the series in her AfterEllen October 31, 2008 column for the portrayal of the couple's onscreen physical affection, criticized the structure and overall writing of the romance. "...many queer and straight viewers began heading for the door when it became clear that the kisses and the wedding plans were just new ways to dress up the same old depressing and boring lesbian storylines about sperm donors, custody battles, and sexually confused lesbians," she said. "From an entertainment perspective, some of the conflict between Reese and Bianca at the end was interesting, but overall, their storyline became boring and predictable pretty quickly."
Warn said that the February 12, 2009 statements by Carruthers regarding Reese insulted the audience's intelligence. The statements were not supported by what the audience saw, she said. "There is validity to the argument Carruthers is making — that there simply aren't enough romantic-pairing options for long-running lesbian characters unless you're willing to change the general makeup of the established cast of characters," said Warn. "This logic is frequently used by TV writers and showrunners to justify minimal lesbian visibility, bad lesbian storylines, and the growing trend towards adding bisexual characters to their shows instead of lesbians." Warn said that while this may be an understandable decision for an individual show, when it is happening on various shows, the viewer is "left with a television landscape populated by lesbians who sleep with men, or no lesbians at all, only bisexual characters (who also primarily sleep with men)" and that "All My Children" "fed right into" this with the Reese and Bianca storyline.
On March 23, 2009, "The Advocate" interviewed Braun about her portrayal of Reese and the Reese and Bianca storyline. "From my point of view, Reese is not in love with Zach and she never has been," said Braun. "As far as the kiss, any doubt she may have had about her relationship with Bianca dissolved immediately after it happened. It was a moment of needing a connection. It was not about being in love with Zach. She was drunk, upset, and it was unfortunate. It was a terrible mistake. As far as I am concerned, Reese has always been in love with Bianca."
Braun said Reese's feelings toward Zach can be summed up as a "dear, dear friendship and connection on an intimate but not sexual level". She said that Reese has never had a clear point of view. "One minute I think I am playing a storyline that is going one way, and then there is a detour. So I have to make it clear in my head. Yes, it’s not fun playing the outsider who has nobody, and no strong leg to stand on," said Braun. "Reese has been under a microscope since she came to town and doesn't have any family to support her. There is no one around who knows the essence of who she really is."
Braun clarified that, in some ways, this was "not the story" came on to play but that it was in other ways. "We were getting married, which is why I wanted to do the role," she said. "I thought that we were going to show what it’s like to be a same-sex couple in a loving, committed relationship dealing with what life throws at them and the outside world and how they are treated. There are a lot of story points and ideas I thought we were going to hit upon, but they decided to take it another route."
In response to the LGBT community being left "very disgruntled" with the Reese and Bianca storyline, Braun said, "I am sorry they were not happy, because one of my main reasons for taking this role was to be able to give a positive voice to same-sex couples." Braun agreed that "the issues" went "off-point" and that she understood why it was difficult for viewers to root for the Reese and Bianca couple. She thanked the viewers who supported the pairing despite the way the romance was told. "I was shocked by positive feedback because I know it was not the story they wanted," she said, "but they were so happy to be represented on TV and on a soap."
"Blame" and fan retaliation.
On April 13, 2009, Charles Pratt, Jr., head writer of the series, was interviewed by "TV Guide" about the Reese and Bianca relationship. After saying he felt he had longer to tell the love story and that it could have been better told if not for Riegel temporarily departing as Bianca, Pratt was viewed by fans and critics as blaming Riegel for the failure of the storyline. "I was led to believe we had her for longer than we really did — suddenly I got word that Eden is leaving now," stated Pratt. "We got to play everything we wanted to with Bianca and Reese but not in the time we’d hoped for — in my mind, it was a two-year story. I guess I could have rushed to the wedding earlier so that they’d have had more time together as a married couple and then had them break up, but I think the fans would have been even more unsatisfied with that."
Despite earlier comments by Carruthers that "Reese never wavered in her commitment to Bianca" and was not bisexual, Pratt admitted that they were considering on "turning" Reese bisexual. "...if Tamara decided to stay, keeping her on the show as an angry lesbian — with no other lesbian characters on the canvas — would be kind of insane," said Pratt. "So we thought about making Reese bisexual — kind of an Anne Heche who bounces back and forth — and maybe make her an opportunistic black widow, a real bad girl. And Tamara would have been really great at that. But, ultimately, we decided to stick with the message."
Pratt's comments to "TV Guide" about Riegel and the storyline angered viewers and critics, who felt Pratt was being dishonest about not knowing how long Riegel was signed on for and did not admit to what they consider the true flaws of the love story. They reasoned that it was known from the beginning, to even fans of the series, that Riegel had only signed on for a four-month contract to portray the Reese and Bianca storyline and that her four-month contract should not mean that the story could not have been better written. In early 2009, Riegel briefly exited the show to focus her attention on pilot season. She had said that if the story was well-written, she would extend her contract. She ultimately declined extending, but agreed to return to "tie up" the Reese and Bianca storyline for a spring 2009 "happy" ending.
Fans "retaliated" against Pratt's comments about Riegel and the storyline. Two fans created an animated online series called "Pratt Falls" to "skewer" the show's executives about the love story. In Season 1, Episode 1 of the parody, viewed on YouTube, a fictional Carruthers has to tell Pratt that there are "fans" who become emotionally invested in the show. The fictional Pratt asks, "Who are Bianca and Reese?" and "We have lesbians on our show?" The series, described as tongue-in-cheek, concludes its first episode with the animated Pratt announcing that he has devised a plan to blame the failed storyline on Riegel as he urges Carruthers to call "TV Guide" to arrange an interview.

The Believers (novel)

The Believers is a novel by Zoë Heller first published in 2008. It depicts a left-wing New York family of grown-ups who have little in common. The patriarch suffers an unexpected stroke and falls into a coma, after which each family member tries to continue his own unconventional course in life while at the same time trying to accommodate various revelations about the dying man and assisting and supporting the other family members in their lives.
The motto of the book—"The challenge of modernity is to live without illusions and without becoming disillusioned"—is a quotation from Antonio Gramsci. It has been noted that "The Believers", Heller's third novel, bears no resemblance to her previous book, the successful "Notes on a Scandal" (2003).
Plot summary.
In 1962, at a party in London, 18 year-old Audrey Howard meets Joel Litvinoff, a prominent leftist lawyer involved with the civil rights movement who is on a short visit from the United States. Although Litvinoff is a complete stranger and fourteen years her senior, the two feel a mutual attraction, and when Litvinoff, after they have had sex, half-seriously suggests that Audrey follow him to the United States and become his wife, she takes him up on his offer without hesitation as she feels her chance has come to break away from her unexciting life as a typist in suburban London.
Both Joel and Audrey are Jewish but were raised in non-observant families. When they start their own family in Greenwich Village, they pride themselves on being atheists and thus having to fear nothing from death or life thereafter. Audrey bears two girls, Karla and Rosa, and the couple also adopt Lenny, whose mother, a left-wing radical, is serving a long-term prison sentence. Underneath the liberal veneer, however, the Litvinoffs display many of the characteristics of a traditional family: Audrey dedicates her existence to supporting her husband's legal career, turns a blind eye to his many extra-marital affairs, and does not oppose the patriarchal attitudes and behaviour that he exhibits at home. For four decades, their family life develops according to their chosen socialist agenda, which has its foundation in the ambition to fight injustice, help the weak, and, generally, make the world a better place to live.
In 2002, at age 72, Joel is still active as a successful and charismatic defense lawyer, in his current case representing, in the wake of the September 11 attacks, an Arab American man accused of being a terrorist. Rosa, a rather attractive young woman, is a disillusioned revolutionary whose four-year stay in Castro's Cuba has alienated her from her socialist principles and has recently made her turn to Orthodox Judaism for an answer to the fundamental questions of life. She now works with disadvantaged children, although she thoroughly hates this job. Single, she shares a small flat with another young woman who has a more glamorous job and a more carefree outlook on life. Her sister Karla, who has had to fight obesity since childhood, is a social worker at a hospital—when she was young she was not encouraged by her parents to be a lawyer like her father—whose marriage to Mike, a labor union activist, has turned sour and remained childless in spite of her ongoing efforts to become pregnant. Joel and Audrey's adopted son Lenny has a history of drug abuse and a girlfriend called Tanya but no other assets to speak of; the family suspect that he might be using drugs again.
During a court session, Joel has a stroke from which he will never recover. Unconscious at first, he is hospitalised and falls into a coma. All the family members gather around the patient but there is nothing they can do to improve his condition. After several months have passed, Audrey is approached by the doctors who inform her that now would be the appropriate time to turn off all life-sustaining equipment. Audrey is furious and does not give her consent although at the same time she realizes her hypocrisy: terminating his life would be in accordance with a mutual agreement they made long before his stroke. Eventually, a few weeks after her refusal, Joel contracts an infection and dies.
Shortly after Joel's hospitalisation, Audrey meets Berenice Mason, a young, unattractive African American freelance photographer and visual artist who claims that Joel is the father of her four year-old son Jamil. Audrey is incredulous at first but after seeing written proof realizes the woman is telling the truth. For Audrey, this revelation is more distressing than her husband's illness as it occurs to her how little their relationship has been based on mutual trust and honesty:
While their father is dying the Litvinoff children try to pursue their own happiness. When Lenny collapses during a family gathering and admits to taking drugs again, he is sent to the country for the summer, far away from the lure of substance abuse, to stay with a friend of Audrey. Meanwhile, Rosa tries to satisfy her newfound curiosity about Orthodox Judaism by spending a weekend with a rabbi's family in Monsey. Uncertain about her future, at around the same time she also has a date with a former colleague from university. Although it is soon obvious to her that the man has become a self-obsessed bore, she has sex with him, only never to see him again. At the close of the novel, after her father's death, Rosa is preparing her departure for Jerusalem, to study the Torah at a yeshiva.
Unbeknownst to her husband Mike, Karla's dead-end marriage will not last much longer. While outwardly complying with her spouse's wish to adopt a child, Karla starts an on-and-off affair with the overweight Arab American owner of the newspaper shop at the hospital where she works. At the end of the novel she prematurely leaves the post-memorial reception held in honour of her father to meet her lover and possibly to remain with him.
Reviews.
"The Believers" was published to almost unanimously positive reviews. It has been called a "cruelly clever new novel", "an observant and unsentimental family drama that pits rationalism against faith", "at heart an American novel: a larger, more considered, layered and utterly assured study of a family driven by political passion whose personal lives refuse to comply with prescribed ideology", and simply "a brilliant, brilliant book". Critics agree that it defies comparison with "Notes on a Scandal" to all intents and purposes, and that it is rich in character development.
Reviewers and critics frequently note Heller's "penchant for unlikeable characters", which is sometimes considered "one of her most interesting trademarks" but is also felt to be an annoying trait of her writing. Heller has retorted by stating that
Lionel Shriver notes that the character of Joel Litvinoff may be modelled on William Kunstler.

Louis Cardwell

Louis Cardwell (20 August 1912 – 23 April 1986) was an English professional footballer. A defender, he spent six years at Blackpool in the 1930s, making over 100 Football League appearances for the club, and helping Blackpool to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1936–37. He later played for Manchester City, Netherfield, and Crewe Alexandra.
Playing career.
Blackpool.
After starting his career with South Shore and Imperial Hydro, Cardwell made his debut for Blackpool on 17 January 1931, in a 5–1 defeat at Middlesbrough. It was his only league appearance of the 1930–31 season; he did, however, appear in the club's two FA Cup ties. He missed the entire 1931–32 campaign due to injury, and only returned with ten games of the following 1932–33 season remaining, appearing in six of them. Sandy MacFarlane succeeded Harry Evans as Blackpool manager prior to the 1933–34 season, and the Scot only gave one start to Cardwell, in a 3–0 Boxing Day defeat at Hull City. The following season, however, he selected him in 29 of the club's 42 league games.
Cardwell served under his third Blackpool manager (this time Joe Smith) for the 1935–36 term, and he went on to be ever-present for the season. He also scored five goals. The first three came in consecutive games: against Bradford City on 7 March, Plymouth Argyle a week later, and then against Barnsley on 21 March. The remaining two were both from the penalty spot: against Hull City on 11 April, and against Newcastle United on 22 April, in the penultimate game of the league campaign.
Cardwell was also ever-present the following season, 1936–37, as Blackpool were promoted to the First Division as runners-up of the Second Division. In 1937–38, Cardwell started in eleven of the first twelve league games (and scored in one of them) before being sold to Manchester City. His final game for the "Seasiders" came on 16 October, a 2–0 defeat to Chelsea at Bloomfield Road.
Manchester City and beyond.
Cardwell played 39 League games for Manchester City. The "Citizens" were relegated out of the top-flight in 1937–38, and finished fifth in the Second Division in 1938–39 – they were five points behind promoted Sheffield United.
He joined Port Vale as a wartime guest in January 1945, making his debut in a 5–0 defeat at Wrexham on 20 January. He scored one goal in seven further games before departing in March 1945. He also guested for Blackpool, Fulham, Millwall, Portsmouth and West Ham United. 
Cardwell moved on loan to Netherfield, and then left Maine Road permanently on a transfer to Crewe Alexandra in 1947. The "Railwaymen" finished tenth and 12th in the Third Division North in 1947–48 and 1948–49 under the stewardship of Frank Hill and Arthur Turner. He played 25 league games during his two seasons at Gresty Road.

Powerlifting at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Women's 67.5 kg

Sheremetev Sh-5

__NOTOC__
The Sheremetev Sh-5 (Шереметьев Ш-5) was a two-seat sailplane designed by Boris Nikolayevich Sheremetev and produced in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. It was an unorthodox design, with a pod-and-boom layout and a cruciform tail that had its horizontal stabiliser mounted atop the boom with a large ventral fin extending below it. The monoplane wing was mounted high, on a pylon above the fuselage pod, and braced to the fuselage with V-struts. Two open cockpits were provided in tandem, with the rear cockpit located beneath the wing. The landing gear consisted of a single sprung skid under the fuselage and a small tailwheel on the ventral fin.
The Sh-5 was used to establish several records during the decade, including distance records of and in 1933, and an altitude record set by Dmitri Aleksandrovich Koshits in 1935. On May 11 the same year, Koshits made a long-distance flight through the Caucasus mountains in a Sh-5 towed behind a Polikarpov R-5, covering at altitudes up to in 34 hours of flight.
The Sh-5 was also produced in Turkey as an unlicenced copy by THK as the THK-9 and subsequently by MKEK as the MKEK 7 when the latter company took over the production facilities of the former in 1952.

Heinrich Werner (composer)

Heinrich Werner (2 October 18003 March 1833) was a German composer.
He was born in 1800 into a musical family in Kirchohmfeld in the Eichsfeld district of Thuringia. Initially trained at home, he played the organ for the local church at the age of 11 and became a choral singer at Sankt Andreasberg at 15. His older brother in Braunschweig had him study music and visit the Gymnasium there. Starting in 1821, he studied in Erfurt and took the teaching examination the next year; he then led the chorus at the city's opera house and taught music students.
He is said to have written 84 compositions, mostly songs, including a setting of Goethe's poem "Heidenröslein". It was first publicly performed in 1829, under his direction, and bore as title the first line, "Sah ein Knab' ein Röslein stehn" ("A boy saw a little rose standing"). It was seen as superior to all the roughly 100 versions that had preceded his, and became the outstanding popular-song version (although the Schubert art-song setting, published in 1821, has outlasted it).
He died at the age of 32 in Braunschweig in 1833, having become ill with tuberculosis the preceding fall.

Portuguese in the Americas

In the Americas, Portuguese is the official and national language of Brazil as well as one of three official languages of MERCOSUL. In addition it is spoken by other smaller communities throughout the western hemisphere. Lusophone immigration came from various countries and in various waves throughout the Americas.
Geographic distribution.
Brazil is the largest country in which Portuguese is spoken in the Americas with a population of approximately 190 million, almost all of whom are native speakers of Portuguese. The size of this population renders Portuguese a relevant regional and world language. Research in regional and social variation in Brazilian Portuguese reveals the diversity of this language. The country also received settlers from Portugal and white settlers from former Portuguese African colonies, East Timor, and Macau and Eurasian settlers from Macau and East Timor.
Argentina was the first Spanish-speaking member state of Mercosur to participate in the Frontier schools project. It involves the exchange of language teachers with Brazil. Secondary schools are now required to offer Portuguese as a foreign language. The same goes for primary schools in provinces bordering Brazil.
Uruguay, born out of conflict first between the Spanish and Portuguese empires and then Brazil and Argentina, has Portuguese speakers in northern region. The acronym DPU (Dialectos Portugueses del Uruguay) is used to describe the varieties of Portuguese spoken in this region. DPU is not standardized and so Brazilian Portuguese serves as the primary model for Uruguayan speakers of Portuguese, native and non-native speakers alike. Instruction in Portuguese has now been increased in the Uruguayan education system. In the northern departments bordering Brazil, education has become bilingual combining Spanish and Portuguese as languages of instruction.
Paraguay has been receiving waves of Brazilian immigrants for decades, known as "Brasiguaios". Unlike in Uruguay, the Brasigaios are a result of more recent immigration and, as such, are more markedly Brazilian in speech and cultural identity. These immigrants tend to settle in the eastern regions of the country and most originate from the Brazilian state of Paraná. Estimates of the size of this community range from 200,000 to 500,000.
Venezuela has a large and prominent Portuguese immigrant community, one of the largest in Hispanoamerica. Its membership in MERCOSUR is pending and, towards that end, the Venezuelan government has begun to encourage the teaching of Portuguese as a second language. Portuguese is to be made available in the public school system. 
In the USA, the state of Massachusetts has the largest communities of Portuguese speakers. Portuguese, Angolan, Brazilian, and Cape Verdean immigrants have been in the US for a couple of centuries.
Canada has received lusophone immigrants primraily from Portugal, Angola and Brazil. Portuguese immigrants first arrived in Canada the 1950s. The majority of Luso-Canadians are settled in Toronto, Ontario and in Montreal, Quebec. According to the 2006 census, there are 318,000 Canadians of Portuguese origin.
The prominence of Brazilian Portuguese.
In the Americas, it is Brazilian Portuguese which is the standard for learners and non-native speakers. P.l.e. (Português como língua estrangeira) is the acronym used to describe the learning and instruction of Portuguese as a second or foreign language; a term comparable to ESL. Brazil's growing international profile and the adoption of Portuguese as an official language of Mercosur have created a demand for non-native fluency in Portuguese in the Hispanic member states. This has accompanied a growth in private language instruction in Portuguese in said countries.
The Museum of the Portuguese language (the second language museum in the world) is located in São Paulo, Brazil.
The Brazilian Ministry of education has developed a proficiency test in Portuguese specifically for Brazil and based on the Brazilian norm: CELPE-Bras
The latest orthgraphic agreement was ratified first by Brazil and while it requires adjustments in spelling, hyphenation and accentuation from all CPLP member states, the agreement favours the Brazilian norm.
Media and popular culture.
Portuguese-speaking communities in the Americas outside of Brazil, from Canada to South America form the primary audience for Brazilian and Portuguese satellite television in their respective countries. Such programming be it football matches, telenovelas or variety shows allow lusophones outside of Brazil to access media and cultural content in Portuguese and stay informed and connected to events in Brazil. Rede Globo and RTPi are available throughout the Americas. 
Immigrants from Portugal, Brazil and Lusophone Africa in North America, Hispanomerica and the Caribbean maintain Portuguese to one degree or another as a heritage language. Locally produced and published 'ethnic' media (print, radio and television programming) allow for Lusophone immigrants to articulate their realities in the host countries in Portuguese.

Mizpah Hotel

The Mizpah Hotel is a historic hotel in Tonopah, Nevada. Mizpah Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
The five-story Mizpah was the tallest building in Nevada until 1929. It was named after the Mizpah Mine and was the social hub of Tonopah. The hotel was pre-dated by the Mizpah Saloon, which opened in 1907, and was the first permanent structure in Tonopah. The hotel was financed by George Wingfield, George Nixon, Cal Brougher and Bob Govan and designed by George E. Holesworth of Reno, Nevada (other sources state that the architect was Morrill J. Curtis). Brougher in particular was involved with the Belmont, Tonopah, Midway and Tonopah Mining Company and the Tonopah Divide Mining Company. Brougher owned the Tonopah Banking Corporation, which had an office in the lobby of the 1905 building, and was a director of the Bank of Italy in San Francisco.
The reinforced concrete hotel was faced with stone on the front and brick on the sides and rear. The neighboring three-story Brougher-Govan Block, with rooms on the upper floors, served as the first Mizpah and remains connected. Cast iron columns were used in the windows and fire escapes. The three and five story buildings are joined with a wood stairway crowned with a skylight.. Steam heat was provided, along with the first elevator in Tonopah.
According to legend, Wyatt Earp kept the saloon, Jack Dempsey was a bouncer, and Howard Hughes married Jean Peters at the Mizpah. But Wyatt Earp left Tonopah before the Mizpah was built, Hughes was married in Tonopah, but not at the Mizpah, and Dempsey asserted he was never a bouncer. The hotel nevertheless features the Jack Dempsey Room and the Wyatt Earp Bar.
The hotel is said to house a ghost deemed "the Lady in Red" by hotel guests who have experienced her presence. Legend says that the Lady in Red is the ghost of a prostitute who was beaten and murdered on the fifth floor of the hotel by a jealous ex-boyfriend. Another widely accepted description of the events is that The Lady in Red had been caught cheating by her husband at the hotel after he had missed a train, who then proceeded to kill her in a jealous rage. The Lady in Red haunting of the Mizpah was featured in season 5, episode 2 of" Ghost Adventures" on the Travel Channel.
The hotel had been shuttered since 1999, however, in early 2011, the hotel was purchased by Fred and Nancy Cline of Sonoma, CA who renovated and reopened the building to the public in August 2011. The newly renovated hotel features 47 rooms, a bar, and two restaurants; The Pittman Cafe and the more upscale Jack Dempsey Room. There are plans to renovate further rooms in the hotel annex and to add a small casino to the property.

Waterside Centre

The Waterside Centre is a controversial development in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada proposed by Halifax real estate developer, the Armour Group. The project involves demolishing six heritage buildings to be replaced by a nine story retail and office building with partially constructed facades of the some of the former heritage buildings. Halifax City Council rejected the development in the fall of 2008 but the developer immediately demolished one of the buildings and appealed Council's decision which was overturned by Nova Scotia's Utility and Review Board on March 26, 2009.
The Site.
The six buildings occupy a downtown block facing the Halifax waterfront bounded by Upper Water Street, Duke Street, Hollis Street and the Cogswell interchange. Along with the adjacent waterfront buildings of Historic Properties with the Victorian commercial buildings of the Granville Mall, the site is one of the only intact blocks of 19th-century buildings in Downtown Halifax. It includes the oldest storefront in Halifax and the site of the famous 18th-century tavern “The Great Pontack”, where James Wolfe planned the siege of Louisbourg and Quebec. The buildings have housed commercial and retail tenants, but Armour group has said that the buildings are no longer economical and their replacements by facades should be seen as restoration. The buildings on the block include the 1820 Harrington MacDonald-Briggs Building the oldest remaining commercial building in Halifax, the 1861 Fishwick & Company Building, the 1926 Imperial Oil Building as well as the 1840 Sweet Basil Building, the last wooden "sailortown" building on Halifax's Water Street.
The only building on the historic block not facing demolition by Armour group is the Morse’s Tea Building owned by another developer who has converted the 1841 structure for office use and retained its interior and exterior structure.
The Debate.
The proposed development has split municipal politicians in Halifax. Those opposed, such as Nova Scotia’s Heritage Trust, say that Halifax is losing its small and dwindling number of heritage buildings which are a resource for culture and tourism. Supporters such as the downtown Halifax Business Commission say that developers should be given a free rein to promote economic activity. The debate has also led Nova Scotia’s Conservative Premier Rodney MacDonald to intervene in the city's politics in support of the development and demolition.
Almost all of the presenters at public hearings in September 2008 opposed the project, including officials in the province's tourism industry.
A signature with over 690 names opposing the development was presented to Halifax City Council in October 2008 Possible solutions have been suggested include a land swap or a compromise development but to date all have been rejected by Armour Group except for an offer to reduce the office tower by two stories if given large property tax breaks.
The heritage buildings on the block were saved from demolition in the 1970s when heritage advocates stropped a planned Harbourfront expressway promoted by city traffic engineers and developers which would have demolished all older buildings on the waterfront. The move was seen as key to reviving the Halifax waterfront and Halifax's downtown tourism. Heritage proponents have argued that the pending demolition underscores Halifax's weak heritage laws. Unlike most older North American cities, Halifax has no heritage districts preserving blocks of heritage buildings but only has individual building designation which may easily be overturned by developers seeking demolition.
Rejection, appeal and demolition.
The development was rejected by the council of Halifax Regional Municipality in a tie vote on October 21, 2008. The head of Armour Group, Ben McCrae, initially said he would not appeal as it would create bad publicity. However Doug MacIsaac of Armour Group announced on October 31 that his company would appeal council's decision to Nova Scotia’s Utility and Review Board, the same day as his company began demolition of the first of the six buildings, the former Sweet Basil restaurant. The Board overturned Halifax council's decision on March 26, 2009, and Halifax council voted on April 7 not to appeal the Board's decision.

USS War Bug (SP-1795)

USS "War Bug" (SP-1795) was a three-armed motorboat in commission in the United States Navy as a patrol vessel from 1917 to 1918.
"War Bug" was built as the wooden-hulled motorboat "Herreshoff 320" at Bristol, Rhode Island, in 1917 by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company for a private owner, and probably was designed with possible naval service in mind. The U.S. Navy purchased "Herreshoff 320" from Felix Warburg of New York City on 6 November 1917 for use as a patrol vessel in World War I. Armed and designated SP-1795, she was commissioned as USS "War Bug" on 17 November 1917.
"War Bug" was assigned to the 1st Naval District and served in waters near Boston, Massachusetts, through the end of World War I. 
Due to an urgent need for craft such as "War Bug" at Brest, France, an order dated 14 October 1918 went out from Washington, D.C., to Boston directing the Commandant of the 1st Naval District to ready six section patrol boats -- USS "Commodore" (SP-1425), USS "Cossack" (SP-695), "War Bug", USS "Sea Hawk" (SP-2365), USS "Kangaroo" (SP-1284), and USS "SP-729" -- to be shipped to France as deck cargo along with spare parts to keep them operational. However, this proposed movement appears to have been cancelled, probably because of the armistice with Germany of 11 November 1918 that ended World War I and eliminated the need for more U.S. Navy patrol craft in Europe.
Decommissioned on 28 December 1918, "War Bug" was sold on 30 June 1919 to E. Atkins and Co., of Boston.

Brandon Tate

Brandon Tate (born October 5, 1987) is an American football wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League. He was drafted by the New England Patriots in the third round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at North Carolina.
Early years and family.
Tate attended Hugh M. Cummings High School in Burlington, North Carolina, where he played football as a wide receiver, kick returner, and defensive back and basketball as a guard. In basketball, he won a state title in his junior season. In his 2004 senior football season, Tate had 66 receptions and 18 touchdowns, earning All-Conference honors.
Tate's brother, Barry, was a four-year letterwinner for Lenoir-Rhyne University in football.
College career.
Freshman Season.
After graduating from high school in 2005, Tate attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Tate was one of seven true freshman to see game time. Tate played in all eleven games as a kick returner. In the Tar Heels game against the Utah Utes, Tate returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. Tate finished the season with 21 kick returns for 542 yards, and 29 punt returns for 267 yards. Tate finished 22nd in the country in kick off returns. In his freshman season, Tate finished second in the Atlantic Coast Conference in kick returns and third in punt returns.
Sophomore Season.
In his sophomore season, Tate was one of only three players in the country to return two kickoffs for touchdowns. Brandon Tate caught his first pass from Cameron Sexton, in the Tar Heels game against the Virginia Tech Hokies. The pass was for 13 yards, with the catch happening just before the end of the first half. In the Tar Heels' game against Notre Dame, Tate returned a kick off 90 yards for a touchdown. Tate faked a pitch to teammate Quinton Person, and bolted down the field into the end zone. In the final game of the Tar Heels season, against Duke, Tate performed very well. With seventeen seconds remaining in the first half of the game, Tate returned a kick off 97 yards for a touchdown. That 97 yard return tied third longest return in North Carolina's history. Early in the fourth quarter, Tate returned a punt 54 yards for a touchdown. Tate became the third person in North Carolina football  history and the ninth player in NCAA  history to return a kickoff and a punt for a touchdown in the same game. Tate caught his first pass, a 17 yard reception, from Cameron Sexton.
Junior Season.
In the opening game of the season against James Madison, Brandon Tate caught his first touchdown pass of his career. Tate caught a 28 yard pass for his first catch of the season, as well as his first touchdown of his career. When North Carolina squared off against East Carolina, Tate returned a punt 58 yards for a touchdown. This was Tate's fifth career return for a touchdown, which tied the school record; which was held by Charlie Justice.

John Adams Jackson

John Adams Jackson (November 5, 1825 — August 30, 1879) was a noted American sculptor.
Jackson was born in Bath, Maine, and apprenticed to a machinist in Boston, where he gave evidence of talent by modelling a bust of Thomas Buchanan Read. There he studied linear and geometrical drawing and produced crayon portraits. Going abroad in 1853, he visited Florence, where he created several portrait busts in marble, then went to Paris in 1854, where he studied academic life drawing at the Académie Suisse. In 1858 he went to New York City, remaining until 1860, when he moved to Florence, Italy, which was afterward his home.
Jackson's portrait busts include those of Daniel Webster (1851); Adelaide Phillips (1853); Wendell Phillips (1854); "Eve and the Dead Abel" (1862); "Autumn"; "Cupid Stringing his Bow"; "Titania and Nick Bottom"; "The Culprit Fay" (many times repeated); "Dawn" (repeated); "Peace"; "Cupid on a Swan"; "The Morning Glory" (a medallion repeated fourteen times); "Reading Girl" (1869); "Nusidora" (Vienna Exposition, 1873); "Hylas" (1875); and "Il Pastorello," an Abruzzi peasant-boy with his goat.

Like most Japanese silent films, it played with "benshi" accompaniment. The film centers on the theme of the strength of a woman who gives everything to the man she loves; a theme which Mizoguchi explored his whole life. The moving camera technique and bold retrospective scenes greatly reflect Mizoguchi's experimental approach.
Reception.
Japanese film scholar Chika Kinoshita noted that the film occupies a special place within the critical reception of Kenji Mizoguchi's oeuvre and it has been signed out as one of the earliest embodiments of his style in the late 1930s.

Intelligent verification

Intelligent Verification, also referred to as intelligent testbench automation, is a form of functional verification used to verify that an electronic hardware design conforms to specification before device fabrication. Intelligent verification uses information derived from the design and existing test description to automatically update the test description to target design functionality not verified, or "covered" by the existing tests. 
Intelligent verification software has this key property: given the same test environment, the software will automatically change the tests to improve functional design coverage in response to changes in the design. Other properties of intelligent verification may include:
"Intelligent Verification" uses existing logic simulation testbenches, and automatically targets and maximizes the following types of design coverage:
History.
Achieving confidence that a design is functionally correct continues to become more difficult. To counter these problems, in the late 1980s fast logic simulators and specialized hardware description languages such as Verilog and VHDL became popular. In the 1990s, constrained random simulation methodologies emerged using hardware verification languages such as Vera and "e", as well as SystemVerilog (in 2002), to further improve verification quality and time.
Intelligent verification approaches supplement constrained random simulation methodologies, which bases test generation on external input rather than design structure. Intelligent verification is intended to automatically utilize design knowledge during simulation, which has become increasingly important over the last decade due to increased design size and complexity, and a separation between the engineering team that created a design and the team verifying its correct operation. 
There has been substantial research into the intelligent verification area, and commercial tools that leverage this technique are just beginning to emerge.

Praht Thai School

Praht Thai School is a unique trilingual co-educational school located Near the new Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok. Open in 2007, PTS was set up to deliver the IC Internationalised Curriculum that was developed in South East Asia utilising the leading subject-by-subject curricula from around the world but delivered largely in the native Thai language following the requirements of the Thai National Curriculum. The curriiculum imposes a fully structured and mandatory English and Chinese language learning programme commencing at Kindergarten. 
Praht Thai School is for students from Nursery (2 year olds) through to Kindergarten 1 (3 year-olds); Primary school (Years 1-6)and is designed to include 7–12 in the school.
Praht Thai School is the first school in Thailand to be known as a "Thai International School".
Curriculum.
The model of trilingual education applied at Praht Thai is known as the Praht Thai Internationalised Curriculum (PTIC). Students are taught four key learning areas (Mathematics, Science, Language Arts and Social Studies). Instruction is delivered with an emphasis on Thai language and cultural understanding. The infusion of the world’s leading curricula from countries such as Singapore (Mathematics and Chinese), The UK, the US and Australia (Social Studies, Science and Language Arts).
Praht Thai students learn (particularly in the early years) in the mother tongue (Thai) to ensure that the best level of education can be delivered without the confusion and curriculum constraints created by the so-called immersion models.Praht Thai does not believe in nor follow any form of immersion programmes as used in many "bilingual" or "English Programme" schools.
In common with the better International schools, Praht Thai provides international learning and understanding for students in a form that can be easily absorbed through the enhanced Praht Thai Internationalised Curriculum. The Thai, English and Chinese lessons are taught by different teachers.
Praht Thai is a language-oriented school with a focus on Advanced Academics and Optimised Personal Development for students.
Thai-medium lessons adhere to the standards set by curriculum developers from as far afield as Singapore, Australia and Great Britain.
Internationalised Curriculum and Equivalency.
Praht Thai Schools have adopted a benchmark standard called "Equivalency". Through curriculum implementation and comparative analysis against major global curricula, the Equivalency standard seeks to deliver a position for students whereby upon completion of schooling at a Praht Thai School, students are expected to be equally able to pursue higher education in Thai-medium or English-medium institutions in Thailand or abroad.
As the curriculum is based on the infusion and inclusion of the most-recognised leading subject area programmes from around the world the curriculum based becomes by default a globally equivalent standard at the highest level. By drawing on these recognised subject area curricula IC has set an equivalency standard that will allow students the opportunity to be studying on par with the best in any subject area anywhere in the world at each age and grade level.
(An example of this is the absorption of the latest Singapore MOE Mathematics curriculum into the mostly Thai-language deliver Praht Thai Maths Curriculum. Singapore's Math curriculum is recognised in the past three TIMMS studies (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study conducted every four years since 1995) - ( see Timms link below)).
Language.
Praht Thai is a trilingual school that has its base firmly in the native Thai language. Praht Thai teaches two other languages being English and Chinese. The English and Chinese language lessons provide complete "Language Learning" is delivered in a model designed to ‘teach’ the language as well as enhance the subject matter learning encountered in the Thai delivered curriculum spectrum. 
This differs from the immersion models of schools where subjects are "taught in" English and students therefore are targeted to assume the ability of the English language i the process.
Attainment of academic and liguistic trilingualism is a strong focus of Praht Thai School system. The IC Curriculum takes the position that because of the great language distance between Thai and English, learning core subjects at a high level should be done in the mother tongue. IC highlights the importance of a strong "language-learning" focus in any non-Thai delivered components of the education process. 
The Language system used in Praht Thai follows the British genre of English curricula with input from the developments of language instruction dating as far back as the 1970s combined with modern linguistic learning technologies. Much of the course design also reflects European language training methodologies which have been used successfully throughout Europe for decades.
The Education Program.
Praht Thai has a focus in three areas:
-Academic Excellence (Core subjects at the highest level)
-Language Skills (Thai, English and Chinese)
-Personal Development (Sports and Creative Thinking)
Learning Methodologies.
From Kindergarten to Year 6, PTS applies a number of learning based techniques and philosophies. 
These incorporate many aspects found in areas such as:
Throughout, the school utilises regular activities designed to discover and express students' different intelligences strengths and talents.
Administration and Staff.
The school is managed by Mrs. Sumattaya Leenachunangkool with the assistance of the School Director, Mr. Aldo M Roberto and a team of Thai Directors supported by a foreign administration team. The team includes a growing academic staff comprising Thai and foreign teachers from Britain and Australia. All teachers are duly qualified teachers in their home countries with certified teaching qualifications.

Colored gold

While pure gold is yellow in color, colored gold can be developed into various colors. These colors are generally obtained by alloying gold with other elements in various proportions.
For example, alloys which are mixed 14 parts gold to 10 parts alloy create 14-karat gold, 18 parts gold to 6 parts alloy creates 18 karat, and so on. This is often expressed as the result of the ratio, i.e.: 14/24 equals 0.585 and 18/24 is 0.750. There are hundreds of possible alloys and mixtures, but in general the addition of silver will color gold white, and the addition of copper will color it red. A mix of around 50/50 copper and silver gives the range of yellow gold alloys the public is accustomed to seeing in the marketplace. A small amount (0.2%) of zinc can be added to harden the alloy.
The most common grades of gold, in addition to pure 24K, are 22K (92%), 18K (75%), 14K (58%), 10k (41%) and 9K (38%).
Colored golds can be classified to three groups:
White gold.
White gold is an alloy of gold and at least one white metal, usually nickel, manganese or palladium. Like yellow gold, the purity of white gold is given in karats.
White gold's properties vary depending on the metals and proportions used. As a result, white gold alloys can be used for many different purposes; while a nickel alloy is hard and strong and therefore good for rings and pins, gold-palladium alloys are soft, pliable and good for white gold gemstone settings, sometimes with other metals like copper, silver, and platinum for weight and durability, although this often requires specialized goldsmiths. The term white gold is used very loosely in the industry to describe karat gold alloys with a whitish hue. Many believe that the color of the rhodium plating, which is seen on many commercial pieces, is actually the color of white gold. The term "white" covers a large spectrum of colors that borders or overlaps pale yellow, tinted brown, and even very pale rose. The jewelry industry often improves these off-white colors by rhodium plating.
A common white gold formulation consists of 90 wt.% gold and 10 wt.% nickel. Copper can be added to increase malleability.
The strength of gold-nickel-copper alloys is caused by formation of two phases, a gold-rich Au-Cu, and a nickel-rich Ni-Cu, and the resulting hardening of the material.
The alloys used in jewelry industry are gold-palladium-silver and gold-nickel-copper-zinc. Palladium and nickel act as primary bleaching agents for gold; zinc acts as a secondary bleaching agent to attenuate the color of copper.
Contact allergy.
About one out of eight people has an allergic reaction to the nickel in some white gold alloys when worn over long periods. A typical reaction is a minor skin rash. Because of this, many European countries do not use nickel white gold. White gold alloys made with other metals are less likely to be allergenic.
Rose, red, and pink gold.
Rose gold is a gold and copper alloy widely used for specialized jewelry. Rose gold, also known as pink gold and red gold, was popular in Russia at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and was also known as Russian gold, although this term is now obsolete. Rose gold jewelry is becoming more popular in the 21st century and is commonly used for wedding rings, bracelets, and other jewelry.
Although the names are often used interchangeably, the difference between red, rose, and pink gold is the copper content – the higher the copper content, the stronger the red coloration. Pink gold uses the least amount of copper content, followed by rose gold, and red gold has the highest copper content. A common alloy for 18K rose gold is 75% gold and 25% copper by mass (18 karat). Since rose gold is an alloy of gold and copper, there is no such thing as "pure rose gold." Below are examples of the common alloys for 18K rose gold, 18K red gold, and 18K pink gold:
18K Red Gold: 75% gold, 25% copper
18K Rose Gold: 75% gold, 22.25% copper, 2.75% silver
18K Pink Gold: 75% gold, 20% copper, 5% silver
A common formulation for red gold is 50% gold and 50% copper.
Up to 15% zinc can be added to copper-rich alloys to change their color to reddish yellow or dark yellow.
During ancient times, due to impurities in the smelting process, gold frequently turned a reddish color. This is why many Greco-Roman texts, and even many texts from the Middle Ages, describe gold as "red".
Rose gold alloys.
The highest karat version of rose gold is also known as crown gold, which is 22 karat. Eighteen karat red gold may be made of 25% copper and 75% gold. For 18 karat rose gold, typically about 4% silver is added to 75% gold and 21% copper to give a rose color. 14 karat "red gold" is often found in the Middle East and contains 41.67% copper.
Rose gold in musical instruments.
High-end flutes are very commonly made of solid rose gold, the most common alloy being 14K, but 9K, 10K, 18K and 19.5K are also available from the major flute makers.
Spangold.
Some gold copper-aluminium alloys form a fine surface texture at heat treatment, yielding an interesting spangling effect. At cooling, they undergo a quasi-martensitic transformation from body-centered cubic to body-centered tetragonal phase; the transformation does not depend on the cooling rate. A polished object is heated in hot oil to 150 - 200°C for 10 minutes then cooled below 20°C, forming a sparkly surface covered with tiny facets.
The alloy of 76% gold, 19% copper, and 5% aluminium yields a yellow color, the alloy of 76% gold, 18% copper and 6% aluminium is pink.
Green gold.
Green gold alloys are made by leaving the copper out of the alloy mixture and just using gold and silver. It actually appears as a greenish-yellow rather than green. Eighteen karat green gold would therefore contain a mix of 75% gold and 25% silver (or 73% gold and 27% silver). Fired enamels adhere better to these alloys.
Green gold was known to Lydians as long ago as 860 BC under the name electrum, a naturally-occurring alloy of silver and gold.
Cadmium can be added to gold alloys in amounts of up to 4% to achieve a green color. The alloy of 75% gold, 23% copper, and 2% cadmium yields light-green 18-karat gold. The alloy of 75% gold, 15% silver, 6% copper, and 4% cadmium yields a dark-green alloy. Cadmium is, however, highly toxic.
Grey gold.
Grey gold alloys are made by adding silver, manganese and copper in specific ratios to the gold.
Black gold.
Black gold is a type of gold used in jewelry. Black-colored gold can be produced by various methods:
A range of colors from brown to black can be achieved on copper-rich alloys by treatment with potassium sulfide.
Cobalt-containing alloys, e.g. 75% gold with 25% cobalt, form a black oxide layer with heat treatment at 700 - 950 °C. Copper, iron and titanium can be also used for such effect. Gold-cobalt-chromium alloy (75% gold, 15% cobalt, 10% chromium) yields a surface oxide that's olive-tinted because of the chromium(III) oxide content, is about five times thinner than Au-Co and has significantly better wear resistance. The gold-cobalt alloy consists of gold-rich (about 94% Au) and cobalt-rich (about 90% Co) phases; the cobalt-rich phase grains are capable of oxide-layer formation on their surface.
More recently, a laser technique has been developed that renders the surface of metals deep black. A femtosecond laser pulse deforms the surface of the metal, forming nanostructures. The immensely increased surface area can absorb virtually all the light that falls on it, thus rendering it deep black.
Purple and blue golds.
Purple gold (also called amethyst gold and violet gold) is an alloy of gold and aluminium rich in gold-aluminium intermetallic (AuAl2). Gold content in AuAl2 is around 79% and can therefore be referred to as 18 karat gold. Purple gold is more brittle than other gold alloys, as it is an intermetallic compound instead of a malleable alloy, and a sharp blow may cause it to shatter. It is therefore usually machined and faceted to be used as a "gem" in conventional jewelry rather than by itself. At a lower content of gold, the material is composed of the intermetallic and an aluminium-rich solid solution phase. At a higher content of gold, the gold-richer intermetallic AuAl forms; the purple color is preserved to about 15% of aluminium. At 88% of gold the material is composed of AuAl and changes color. (The actual composition of AuAl2 is closer to Al11Au6 as the sublattice is incompletely occupied.)
Blue gold is an alloy of gold and indium. It contains 46% gold (about 12 karat) and 54% indium, forming an intermetallic compound AuIn2. While several sources remark this intermetallic to have "a clear blue color", in fact the effect is slight: AuIn2 has CIE LAB color coordinates of 79, -3.7, -4.2 which appears roughly as a greyish color. With gallium, gold forms an intermetallic AuGa2 (58.5% Au, 14ct) which has slighter bluish hue. The melting point of AuIn2 is 541 °C, for AuGa2 it is 492 °C. AuIn2 is less brittle than AuGa2, which itself is less brittle than AuAl2.
All the AuX2 intermetallics have crystal structure of CaF2 and therefore are brittle. Deviation from the stoichiometry results in loss of color. Slightly nonstoichiometric compositions are however used, to achieve a fine-grained two- or three-phase microstructure with reduced brittleness. A small amount of palladium, copper or silver can be added to achieve a less brittle microstructure.
The intermetallic compounds tend to have poor corrosion resistance. The less noble elements are leached to the environment, and a gold-rich surface layer is formed. Direct contact of blue and purple gold elements with skin should be avoided as exposure to sweat may result in metal leaching and discoloration of the metal surface.
A surface plating of blue gold on karat gold or sterling silver can be achieved by a gold plating of the surface, followed by indium plating, with layer thickness matching the 1:2 atomic ratio. A heat treatment then causes interdiffusion of the metals and formation of the required intermetallic compound.
Oxide layer blue gold.
Blue gold can be achieved by formation of an oxide layer on an alloy of 75% gold, 24.4% iron, and 0.6% nickel; the layer forms on heat treatment in air between 450–600 °C.
Gold of purity 20–23 carat, when alloyed with ruthenium, rhodium and three other elements and heat-treated at 1800 °C, forms a 3–6 micrometers thick surface layer with a rich sapphire blue color.

<doc id="20063773" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20063773" title="Proposal theme statement">
Proposal theme statement

A proposal theme statement is a technique used in a business proposal to call attention to benefits offered by the vendor to the customer. The concise benefit statement normally precedes discussion of any section of the proposal where the vendor thinks the proposal contains a significant advantage to the prospective customer.
Example.
"Low-risk, commercially available software" might introduce a vendor's solution for meeting a customer's need to buy technology that enables quick, relatively cheap authorization for people trying to use a credit card.
The theme statement is set apart from the text it introduces:
Low-risk, commercially available software
"XYZ Corporation proposes to use ID-Check…"
The theme statement always ties the feature of the offer (i.e., ID-Check) to the primary benefit(s) of that feature (i.e., low-risk and commercially available). Other benefits are implied—e.g., low-risk implies lower long-term cost because of the software is proven and commercially available implies lower initial cost because the software is mass-produced.
Theory behind a theme statement.
The use of theme statements in proposals is based on a reading comprehension technique called an "advance organizer", developed by learning theorist David Ausubel. The advance organizer serves as the launch point for a deductive logic string, where the primary idea is introduced first, followed by supporting detail in descending order of importance. Ausubel's research demonstrated the technique was particularly effective if the reader had little prior knowledge of the subject material.
Drawbacks of theme statements in proposals.
Theme statement in proposals must be carefully constructed. If the assumed customer benefit in the theme statement is not perceived as a benefit to the customer, then credibility is lost. If the theme statement introduces a benefit, but the following discussion does not directly support that benefit, then more credibility is lost. Finally, in concert with Ausubel's findings, theme statements should not be used to introduce sections in a proposal customers already know well. The chances of seeming patronizing or disingenuous are too high.

Joseph M. Marling

Joseph Mary Marling, CPPS (August 31, 1904—October 2, 1979) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Bishop of Jefferson City from 1956 to 1969.
Biography.
Joseph Marling was born in Centralia, West Virginia, and was ordained as a priest of the Society of Precious Blood by Archbishop John McNicholas, OP, on February 21, 1929. After a period of academic and pastoral work, he was elected provincial of his religious institute's American province in 1939.
On June 7, 1947, Marling was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Kansas City, Missouri and Titular Bishop of "Thasus" by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 6 from Archbishop Edwin O'Hara, with Bishops Joseph Albers and John Bennett serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter in Chains Cathedral. He chose as his episcopal motto, "Per Sanguinem Crucis," meaning “Through the Blood of the Cross." In an address to the Guild of Catholic Psychiatrists, he suggested that the clergy should receive psychiatrict treatment.
Marling was later named the first Bishop of Jefferson City on August 29, 1956. During his tenure, he oversaw the construction of a new cathedral, twenty-five churches, twenty-nine schools, thirty rectories, sixteen convents, and a Carmelite monastery. The Bishop also established the diocesan newspaper and missions in Peru. He attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965, and resigned as Bishop on July 2, 1969. Upon his retirement, he was appointed Titular Bishop of "Lesina", a post which he also forfeited on January 16, 1976.
Marling died in Kansas City, at age 75. His remains were interred in the Precious Blood Community Cemetery on the seminary grounds in Carthagena, Ohio.

David Ball (album)

David Ball is the self-titled debut album from American country music artist David Ball. He recorded the album in 1989 for RCA Records. Three singles from it charted between 1988 and 1989: "Steppin' Out", "You Go, You're Gone" and "Gift of Love", which respectively reached #46, #55 and #64 on the "Billboard" country charts. Despite these three singles, however, the album was not released by RCA until late 1994, by which point Ball had been signed to Warner Bros. Records for the release of his breakthrough album "Thinkin' Problem".
The track "I Was Born with a Broken Heart" was previously a #75 single in 1989 for Josh Logan from his album "Somebody Paints the Wall", and would later be a #38 single for Aaron Tippin from his 1992 album "Read Between the Lines". In addition, Ball re-recorded "Texas Echo" for his 2001 album "Amigo".

A Trick of the Tail (song)

"A Trick of the Tail" is a song by the progressive rock band Genesis taken from the "album of the same name". It was written by the band's keyboard player Tony Banks and was the first Genesis song to be accompanied by a promotional video, which features the band gathered around a piano performing the song and directed by Bruce Gowers and it was the first single of Genesis featuring lead vocalist Phil Collins.
Music video.
Special effects make Collins appear to walk and dance on the piano and Steve Hackett's guitar. In a 1994 interview with VH1 for the Phil Collins One On One episode, Phil called the video the most embarrassing and cringe-worthy of his entire career.
History.
The song was released as a single with "Entangled" as the b-side but failed to make any significant chart impact. The majority of the song was written in 1972 and was originally intended for the Foxtrot album. The song's rhythm, according to Banks, is heavily influenced by The Beatles' "Getting Better".
The lyrics are based on the book The Inheritors by William Golding. The title of the song is taken from the name of the last chapter. Like much of the A Trick of the Tail album, the song's lyrics focus on a specific character: the "Beast" who leaves his own kingdom and enters the world of humans. He is captured and put on display in a freak show after his captors refuse to believe in his kingdom. The Beast laments his decision to leave his home, describing it as a paradise covered in gold. His captors then release him in exchange for leading them to his world. However, just as they see what appears to be a "spire of gold", they find that the Beast has vanished, though they do hear his voice.
Live performances.
Genesis never performed "A Trick of the Tail" live.

Simon Martin (Mayanist)

Simon Martin is a British epigrapher, historian, writer and Mayanist scholar. He is best known for his contributions to the study and decipherment of the Maya script, the writing system used by the pre-Columbian Maya civilization of Mesoamerica. As one of the leading epigraphers active in contemporary Mayanist research, Martin has specialised in the study of the political interactions and dynastic histories of Classic-era Maya polities. A former honorary research fellow at the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, Martin holds a position at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology where he is a senior research specialist in Maya epigraphy.
Early life and career.
Simon Martin entered the field of Mayanist research with a professional background in graphic design. He attended the Royal College of Art in London during the 1980s, completing his Master's in design in 1987. As a professional designer he worked in televisual media into the mid-1990s, for production companies designing visual elements and programmed content for TV, film and commercials.
Martin had been fascinated by the Maya civilization since childhood. After a period spent in independent study and research, in the late 1980s Martin began attending Mesoamericanist conferences and Maya hieroglyphics workshops. In parallel with his work in the design profession Martin corresponded with scholars active in Maya research, and travelled to Central America to visit some of the Maya archaeological sites. 
His reading proficency and knowledge of Maya inscriptions was soon recognised in the field, and by the mid-1990s Martin was operating as an honorary research fellow at UCL's Institute of Archaeology.
Martin secured a residential fellowship grant from Washington D.C.'s Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in pre-Columbian studies for the 1996/97 academic year. The fellowship allowed Martin to later move into Mayanist research as his full-time profession.
In 2002 Martin took up a position as the research specialist in Maya epigraphy at the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Museum, from where he has continued to conduct field reconnaissances to the Maya lowlands, write research papers and act as scholarly consultant for several museum exhibitions of Maya art and artefacts.
Research.
In the early 1990s Martin was at the forefront of epigraphic research that would challenge some prevailing views on the nature of Maya lowland states and their political interactions during the Mid- to Late-Classic period. Archaeologists and epigraphers had generally conceived the Maya lowlands region of this era as a mosaic of dozens of polities or city-states, each controlling only a small surrounding territory and acting more or less independently of the others. These states were engaged in alternating episodes of warfare and alliance with one another, but such interactions had been assessed as primarily local and transient in nature.

Clarence W. Spangenberger

Clarence W. Spangenberger (December 9, 1905 – October 21, 2008) was the last president of Cornell Steamboat Company, whose more than 60 vessels made it the largest tugboat company in the United States.
Spangenberger was born in Kingston, New York on December 9, 1905. His parents both earned their incomes serving the shipyard workers and boatmen in Rondout, New York, with his mother selling bread and his father working as a barber. Spangenberger graduated from New York University, majoring in business. He first worked as a sales representative for the Standard Oil Company, before being hired in 1933 by the Cornell Steamboat Company, a firm whose history dated back to 1847. He started in the accounts receivable department and later supervised the firm's engineers, firemen and oilers.
Spangenberger pushed the firm's management to convert to oil power instead of steam. With the change, the company's tugboats could push 21 barges that were grouped three across, rather than having all 21 barges towed end-to-end. He was selected by the firm's trustees to become the head of Cornell in December 1954, at a time when trucks and railroads were changing the dynamics of the shipping business. His efforts to revive the company included dismissing hundreds of employees, all of whom he notified in person.
New York Trap Rock Corporation, a producer of crushed stone that was the business's largest customer, acquired Cornell in 1958, in a merger that combined two of the Hudson River Valley's oldest companies. The Cornell Steamboat name was retained and Spangenberger remained in charge of the towing division. Even with more powerful tugboats and other efficiencies, Cornell went out of business in 1963.
He died at age 102 in Rhinebeck, New York on October 21, 2008.

Abraham González Casanova

Abraham González Casanova (born 16 July 1985), simply known as Abraham, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for RCD Espanyol as a central midfielder.
Club career.
Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Abraham made his professional debuts with local Terrassa FC, appearing in 16 matches during the 2004–05 season in the second division, which ended in relegation.
After a couple of seasons more he was bought by neighbours FC Barcelona, being immediately assigned to its reserve side which competed in the fourth level. He made his debut for the first team during the Copa del Rey tie against Benidorm CF (1–0 win) on 10 October 2008; in the last round of La Liga (30 May 2009), as "Barça" were already champions, he came on as a substitute for Xavi during the 1–1 draw at Deportivo de La Coruña.
Abraham was released by Barcelona in the 2009 summer, joining Cádiz CF as the Andalusia club had just returned to division two after a one-year absence. He appeared regularly for the Andalusians, who were immediately relegated back.
Abraham signed with Gimnàstic de Tarragona for the 2010–11 season, but failed to impress at his new club. In the following transfer window he was loaned to fellow second-divisioner SD Ponferradina, eventually suffering another relegation.
On 15 July 2011 Abraham joined AD Alcorcón, also in the "silver category". After two seasons as a starter (both missing promotion in the play-offs), he moved to La Liga side RCD Espanyol.

Joseph Paruta

Joseph Paruta, also known as ""Old Man"" and ""Sammy Gravano's Personal Luca Brasi"" (December 3, 1929-October 1986 Brooklyn, New York) was a mobster in the Gambino crime family and considered a "key member" of Sammy Gravano's Bensonhurst, Brooklyn crew. He is the only known mobster who asked for a mercy killing after becoming terminally ill with lung cancer. The proposition was agreed upon but Paruta died before the mercy killing was performed.
Biography.
Paruta was born in Bensonhurst on December 3, 1929 to first generation emigrants from Venice, Italy of a Luccan family from Tuscany. It is unknown if he is a descendant of the 15th-century Venetian historian and statesman 
Paolo Paruta, although they share the same last name. He was the youngest of four children who grew up in poverty. Paruta was originally an associate who served in the crew of Gambino crime family capo Salvatore Aurello. He served in the Gambino crime family under the tutelage of Carlo Gambino and later Paul Castellano. Sammy Gravano later said, "Everybody called Joe the "Old Man". He was only about fifteen years older than me (Gravano was born on March 12, 1945) but he already had white hair and looked kind of decrepit. He was tough and loyal. Old Man Paruta would kill for me as quick as he would get me a cup of coffee. Over the years, there was nothing I couldn't ask of him." His capo Sammy Gravano would later say that "he was like my own personal Luca Brasi," in reference to the contract killer character from "The Godfather."
It is unknown if Gravano ever referred to Paruta by his ironic nickname or not. In reference to "The Godfather," Vito Corleone describes the Luca Brasi character (portrayed by Lenny Montana) as a "man who goes around life with a sign that says 'kill me' painted on, this makes everyone want to kill him, but yet no one can. Eventually this man finds someone who doesn't want to kill him and fears that this man is the only one who can kill him".
He was considered an "uncle" to Joseph D'Angelo Jr., the son of D'Angelo Sr., future Gambino crime family mob associate and informant.
Following puberty he started noticeably suffering from premature aging which made appear several decades older. He was a short man in stature with thin arms and legs with a thick torso. By middle age he started to lose his telltale white hair as the Werner's syndrome worsened. He had a hoarse voice and his skin started to thicken and suffer from cataracts. He suffered from smoker's cough that was brought on by his years of smoking cigarettes. He was married to an Italian-American woman named Dorothea, who he nicknamed "Dottie" and had several children. He was a family man who would regularly take his family out to dinner at Tali's restaurant every week and have a large dinner.
He was a close childhood friend of mob associate Vincent Rizzuto Sr. (also known as "Vinnie Oil") born January 9, 1936 from Rockville Centre, New York, of no relation to Vito Rizzuto and Joseph D'Angelo Sr. Vito also served under Salvatore Aurello before becoming a member of Sammy Gravano's crew. Sammy later said, "Old Man Paruta and Vinnie were always together. They were partners in bookmaking and shylock operations. The difference was that Vinnie knew how to make his money grow. Paruta? He gambled away every dime he ever earned on the ponies (horse races)". This suggests that Paruta suffered from ludomania and was a pathological gambler. It is also suspected that he suffered from impulse control disorders such as antisocial personality disorder. Gravano would later say, "There wasn't a day he wasn't at the racetrack, whatever track was open, rooting for some nag that don't come in. But I couldn't have two better guys beside me." 
Frank DeCicco later told Gravano an amusing anecdote about a robbery that Paruta, himself and several other criminal associates had arranged to pull off. He stated, 
He had a mild mannered nature and never demonstrated anger towards his fellow associates. After the murder of Frank Fiala by Sammy Gravano, Edward Garofalo, Thomas Carbonaro, Michael DeBatt and Nicholas Mormando, they assembled at his saloon, Doc's.
Sammy Gravano said about Paruta, 
Premature aging.
It is suspected that Joseph suffered from Werner syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by the appearance of premature aging. By 1959, at the age of thirty Joseph had the telltale condition of the syndrome by having a "birdlike" facial appearance. This made him stand out among the mob associates in Gravano's crew and made him the target of teasing due to his elderly appearance. Other signs that Paruta displayed was cancer and heart disease. It is unknown if Paruta was ever diagnosed with having the condition.
Cancer.
After the DiB (Rober DiBernardo) hit, his smoker's cough got worse and worse. Whatever doctor he was going to told him he should see a specialist, it could be serious". Sammy made arrangements through some doctors he knew and checked him into the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center at 1275 York Avenue in Manhattan, New York for testing. The prognosis was that he had terminal lung cancer that had spread through the rest of his body. The doctors gave him only a year left to live. The chief doctor later confided to Sammy Gravano that he had lied to Paruta's family and that he only had three months to live. Gravano felt that he had to honor his friend. Even after being diagnosed with terminal cancer he did not stop smoking even when staying at the cancer centre.
Initiation into Gambino crime family.
His dying wish was that he become initiated into the Gambino crime family and die a made man. Sammy sent word to John Gotti through his brother Gene for permission to fulfill his last wishes and make his dream of becoming a "made man" true. Gravano personally conducted the ceremony in his room at the cancer centre. When it came time for him to prick his finger for the blood to mix with the holy card, Sammy could hardly get a drop. He was now reduced to a living skeleton.
The death of Joseph D'Angelo.
By 1982, Paruta was starting to act depressed over the murder of his friend Joseph D'Angelo who had been shot to death over a bar room dispute with an associate of the Colombo crime family. Sammy Gravano became concerned of his friend's mental well being. He lost interest in gambling and stopped visiting the horse races at the Acqueduct racetrack in the afternoon like he always had done. He told Gravano when asked about his depression, "Stymie ain't here no more. I'll be with you at your side until the day I die."
Loyalty to the Dellacroce faction and Gravano.
On December 2, 1985 Aniello Dellacroce died. Sammy Gravano stated, "Even before this, we decided we had to split up and go underground. If there was a leak, somebody had to survive and keep playing. Frankie (Frank DeCicco) said him and me would move into Joe Watts' basement. Joe and his wife and kids would stay upstairs. John (John Gotti) and Angie (Angelo Ruggiero) could do what they wanted. I told Debbie I had to leave for a while, maybe for weeks, maybe for months, years. Don't ask. I don't know how long. Nobody in my crew knows anything, except Old Man Paruta. We stayed in contact with John and Angie using certain phone numbers.
Plot to murder Castellano and Bilotti.
After the Roy DeMeo trial started, Thomas Bilotti was known to pick up Paul Castellano and drive him to a restaurant where they sat in a table near the back and discussed business before heading to court in Manhattan. Both Paul and Thomas did not know who Paruta was. Gravano and Watts planned to have Paruta walk into the restaurant and go right past them into the men's washroom. In there, someone would plant a ski mask. He would put the ski mask on and come out with two guns. They would be sitting there eating and discussing their trial when Paruta would just run out shooting. The rest of them would be outside, inside, surrounding the vicinity of the restaurant supporting him with backup. Later Frank DeCicco reported that Paul Castellano had sent him a message to be at a meeting at Spark's Restaurant in Manhattan. It was here that the actual execution would later be orchestrated and carried out. Paruta would not be chosen as one of the shooters in this planning of the murder of Castellano and Bilotti.
Standing up for Sammy Gravano.
After a violent encounter with an outlaw biker in his Bensonhurst, Brooklyn bar, Joseph Paruta offered to help murder a biker who attacked Sammy and almost murdered him. After remaining a fugitive from the mob, the biker returned to Bensonhurst after a few years. Sammy Gravano said: 
"He reaches out for Paruta's kids and asks that they sit down with their father. He knows their father is connected, but he doesn't know he's with me. He says he had this trouble with Sammy the Bull and he knows he's a marked man. He wants Paruta to talk for him, and Paruta says, 'Sure, you're good friends with my kids, I'll talk to this Sammy for you. Just take it easy. Go about your business. Stay low key and I'll reach out for Sammy.' Paruta's son obviously knew their father was bullshitting him. The kids know Paruta is with me and everything that means."
The murder contract was later called off and the outlaw biker's life was spared.
Gangland slaying of Robert DiBernardo.
On June 5, 1986, Robert DiBernardo was lured to the basement offices of Sammy Gravano's drywall company on Stillwell Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Acting as if it was just a regular business meeting, Gravano told Paruta to get DiBernardo a cup of coffee. Paruta got up, but instead of getting the coffee, Paruta took a .38-caliber revolver from a cabinet behind DiBernardo and shot him in the back of the head.
Gangland slaying of Nicholas Mormando.
Nicholas Mormando became hooked on crack cocaine. Sammy later said about Nicholas:
The murder of Nicholas Mormando remained unsolved until Sammy Gravano agreed to become a stool pigeon and testify against John Gotti at his racketeering trial. By the time Gravano was implicated in the murder, Paruta had succumbed to terminal lung cancer.
Mercy killing.
In 1984, during one of Gravano's bedside visits to Paruta, he asked him to kill him. He told Sammy, "Kill me, Sammy. Kill me, please." He tried to get Gravano to understand that a swift bullet was the best gift a true friend could give him. He couldn't stand the pain any more. But like every murder of a made man (which Paruta was), even a mercy killing, he had to get permission. He sent a message through Gene Gotti to John Gotti. He tried to prepare Gene and explain the situation as best as he could. Although Gravano never found out what Gene told John when they discussed Paruta, Gotti denied the mercy killing. He said that there was no way he would authorize a murder contract on a made man under the circumstances they were facing. Sammy brought Gotti's discussion to Paruta who did not accept the answer. He begged Sammy and prevailed on him that the friendship between them was above everything and that the only way he could prove his friendship was by carrying out the murder. Sammy ordered his brother-in-law Edward Garofalo to get a gun with a silencer. Sammy gave Paruta one day's notice to have his family away from the house on the day he was to be murdered. Thomas Carbonaro would be stationed outside the house in a car ready for a swift getaway. Edward and Gravano would go through a back door that would be left open by Paruta. The two of them would go up to the bedroom where Joseph was confined to having fallen very ill at this point. Edward would sit him in a comfortable position and then join Carbonaro in the car outside when Gravano would shoot him. Sammy later said, 
His friend and family consigliere Frank DeCicco would later be murdered a year later. The deaths of D'Angelo, Paruta and Frank DeCicco would all play a heavy toll on Sammy Gravano. With DeCicco's murder, Gravano would no longer have any of his original close friends or crew left having all met their demise either by his hand or at hands of others. The deaths of his criminal associates would later play a factor in deciding to testify against the Gambino crime family and his former boss and friend John Gotti. After Paruta died, he would help support his wife and children financially over the years. He was the only member of Gravano's crew not to meet their fate by being murdered.
He was the last member of Gravano's original Bensonhurst, Brooklyn crew that he had inherited from Salvatore Aurello after Frank DeCicco was murdered by a car bomb in 1985, two years earlier.
Replaced by Louis Vallario.
After Joseph died, Gambino crime family capo Louis Vallario said to Gravano, "I know what you're feeling. I can't fill Stymie's (Joseph D'Angelo)'s shoes, or Paruta's. I wouldn't even try. But I promise I'll be there for you."
In popular culture.
In the movie "Witness to the Mob", Paruta is portrayed by actor Richard Bright.

<doc id="20064223" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20064223" title="Role hierarchy">
Role hierarchy

In role based access control, the role hierarchy defines an inheritance relationship among roles. For example, the role structure for a bank may treat all employees as members of the ‘employee’ role. Above this may be roles ‘department manager’, and ‘accountant’, which inherit all permissions of the ‘employee’ role, while above ‘department manager’ could be ‘savings manager’, ‘loan manager’. 
RBAC models generally treat the role hierarchy as either a tree (set theory), as in the 1992 RBAC model of Ferraiolo and Kuhn (FK), or a partially ordered set in the 1996 RBAC framework of Sandhu, Coyne, Feinstein, and Youman (SCFY). In object oriented programming terms, the tree role hierarchy is single inheritance, while the partial hierarchy allows multiple . When treated as a partial order, the role hierarchy example given above could be extended to a role such as ‘branch manager’ to inherit all permissions of ‘savings manager’, ‘loan manager’, and ‘accountant’. 
Complications can arise when constraints such as separation of duties exist between roles. If separation of duty was used to prohibit personnel from holding both ‘loan manager’ and ‘accountant’ roles, then ‘branch manager’ could not inherit permissions from both of them. The NIST RBAC model, which unified the FK and SCFY models, treats the role hierarchy as a partial order, although RBAC products have not gone beyond the tree structured hierarchy.

Tatsuuma Kiyo

Tatsuuma Kiyo, born on July 16, 1809, was the daughter of a Nishinomiya brewing family, who in the nineteenth century built the largest sake empire in Japan. For many generations, the Tatsuuma house had produced sake and barrels in Nishinomiya. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, Tatsuuma had become a relatively large brewery under Tatsuuma Kichizaemon IX, Kiyo's father. 
Born in 1809, Kiyo was the only child of Tatsuuma Kichizaemon IX. As a child, Kiyo learned and observed the family business, which made her very knowledgeable about the sake industry. In 1830, Kiyo married the son of another brewing house, and in 1842, he assumed the headship of her family as Kichizaemon X. As a married couple, they had many children. Records only show six, but some sources state that she had as many as twelve. Kiyo’s husband died in 1855, and her eldest son took over as the headship of the family. 
For the next fifty years, the Tatsuuma brewery, called Hakushika, prospered greatly. Kiyo never assumed family headship, but she was the power behind them. Women were not allowed inside the brewery, but Kiyo learned to supervise the workers closely. Under her leadership, Hakushika grew to be the largest sake empire in Japan. By 1894, the brewery had an output of 22,000 koku annually, three times larger than the nearest competitor. Under her watch, the brewery underwent many innovations that contributed to its success. 
Kiyo was savvy not only in business, but also in the marriage arrangements she made for her children. Through her strategy of founding branch families, sending out sons to be adopted, and marrying daughters to other brewing houses, she created her own family empire in the sake industry. 
Kiyo died in 1900, only after she expanded the Tatsuuma family enterprises as the largest brewer and shipper of sake in an era when sake was Japan’s major industry.

Cover Me Quick!

Cover Me Quick! (also known as "cover me quick/!\" with the distinctive "/!\" warning sign appended at the end of the name) is a four-piece Power pop/Alternative band from the Philippines. The group's founding members formed the group in 1998 with members 
Rodel "BoX!" Garchitorena, Ernesto Bangiban and Mark Jay Garchitorena.
Just Add Water and Mayrics stints.
Highly influenced by the surfacing of acts like Green Day and other widely popular grunge bands, brothers Mark and Box started jamming shortly after acquiring a new guitar and a second-hand drum set. Box urged Ernie, from their high school band "White Lies", to join the band with his brother. The group immediately jumped into joining a slew of Battle of the Bands, making it a point to record demos off the winnings.
Box, who studied at the University of Santo Tomas, stalked booker Sazi Cosino for a stint at Mayrics, which is located right in front of the university. Booked as "Big Cheese" first, the three-piece changed its name just before stepping on stage to "Just Add Water". Thinking that the set sucked, the band quickly changed their name to "Cover Me Quick" for the next gig at the bar. The band thought the name ("Cover Me Quick") could justify the mistakes they commit on stage.
Early recordings.
Continuing to win band contests, the trio continued recording and eventually got songs in a CD. The two-song EP contained "To the Girl I Did the Other Night" and "Hija" which were featured on NU 107's show "In The Raw". Francis Brew, the show's host, commented that the songs sounded like "a post Silverchair kind of deal", and added that it was a "well played, well produced" demo. Shortly, cover me quick/!\ was also guested on the "In The Raw" TV show.
Getting gigs across the metro because of the radio and TV exposures, the band continued to record demos. The latest batch of songs, now recorded at Sound Creation studios in Quezon City, became the foundation for what would become the band's debut record.
""Road Juan"" and "Sandali Lang".
The band's demo eventually got the attention of local major record label Alpha Music and got them signed in 2001. The next year, ""Road Juan"" was released with the carrier single "Sandali Lang". The song immediately reached NU 107's popular show "The Midnight Countdown" and peaked at no. 9. These developments resulted in relentless tours across the country and eventually had them lined up on the popular summer gig "Pulp Summer Slam".
The Shinji Tanaka sessions and live gig hiatus.
Troubles with their label had the band stop gigging and holing up in Shinji Tanaka's Sound Creation studios where the band continued recording songs. Sessions between 2004-2005 had 15 songs made, but were never released, except for the songs "Sabihin Mo Na Lang", "A Billion" and "Biglang Liko" which were later re-recorded and included in the 2007 album ""Mga Kantang Galing Sa Loob Ng Kwarto Ko"".
""Mga Kantang Galing Sa Loob Ng Kwarto Ko"" and "Gabi Ng Prom".
Struggling to find a core sound, the band started listening to bands Sugarcult, The All-American Rejects, Dashboard Confessional and other widely popular Pop punk bands. This resulted in a gearing to a more "Power pop" sound. Finding a loyal fanbase in schools that the band visited, cover me quick/!\ found themselves signed with Viva Records through the efforts of Mally Paraguya who helped them get a new record deal.
Songs from the new album were recorded at Wombworks Studio in Marikina City, where the band met producer Patrick Tirano who also produced records for Sponge Cola, Pupil (band) and Mayonnaise (band). The song is a full collaborative effort from the band, writing-wise, having wrote equal number of songs for the 10-track sophomore release.
"Tanya, Tanya" was the only song on the album that had the three collaborate on one song. Mark wrote "Fifteen Minutes", "A Billion" and "Sabihin Mo Na Lang", Ernie wrote "Kung Gusto Mo Maraming Paraan, Kung Ayaw Mo Maraming Dahilan", "Biglang Liko" and "Ayoko Na". Box wrote "Ang Huling Kantang Gagawin Ko Para Sa'yo", "Gabi Ng Prom" and "Lagi Kang Tama". Hence, the title of the album which translates to "Songs from my room" in English. The album's official website (now tabbed in the band's new official site) is an interactive flash where you could find lyrics for the 10 songs scattered throughout a house that had three rooms: Ernie's, Mark's and Box's. In the corridor, the lyrics for the carrier single "Tanya, Tanya" is found, but required a pass code from the physical CD to access.
The first single, though unofficial, since it got premature airplay over NU 107 became "Tanya, Tanya". However, months after, the band released a video for the first official single "Gabi Ng Prom" which got decent airplay over local music channels myx and MTV.
New member, new single, and a third album.
After the release of its second album, cover me quick/!\ employed the services of a second guitarist in the person of their long-time friend and roadie Erikson Pasamba. Box comments:
While flirting with a name change and even releasing singles under the name "My Ex-Girlfriend" over pop radio station 99.5 Hit radio, through the show "The Brewrats", the band recorded a new four-song EP that had the new member doing guitar parts and contributing a song. The four-song effort included a song from each of the members of the band.
On September 30, 2008, the band officially returned to the live circuit through the shoot of an acoustic, live video for the new single "Ang Huling Kantang Gagawin Ko Para Sa'yo" from the album ""Mga Kantang Galing Sa Loob Ng Kwarto Ko"".
The making of the new video.
A new single off the album ""Mga Kantang Galing Sa Loob Ng Kwarto Ko"" was released by Viva Records through a live video shoot at 6underground in Ortigas Center, Pasig City. The song is a different version of the song “Ang Huling Kantang Gagawin Ko Para Sa’yo”.
A two-song acoustic set kicked-off the two-set gig completed by a remake of their first single, “Gabi Ng Prom”.
BoX! said Erikson is working on a song for a new album in the works for the group.
The second part of the set featured the band’s new singles from an album in the works, plus the singles off their current one out in the market. The band also featured their "punked-up" version of Sharon Cuneta’s song “Bituing Walang Ningning”.
Indefinite hiatus, new bands.
Before the end of 2008, Box announced on their yahoo groups page [http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/covermequick/] that the band is taking an indefinite hiatus from live gigs and recording. He also hinted on making music with new band/s.

Stokes Castle

Stokes Castle is a three-story stone tower located just outside of Austin, Nevada. It was built by Anson Phelps Stokes, a mine developer, railroad magnate, and banker. Intending the building as a summer home, Stokes began building the castle in 1896, completing it in 1897.
The castle is patterned after a tower that Stokes had seen and admired in the Roman Campagna in Italy. The castle is built of hand-hewn native granite, and the huge stones were hoisted into place with a hand winch and held in place with rock wedging and clay mortar. The kitchen and dining room were on the first floor, while the second floor contained the living room and the third floor housed two bedrooms. Each of the floors had a fireplace, and the second and third floors each had a balcony. The roof had a battlemented terrace.
The family only occupied the Stokes Castle for a short time. The family traveled west in June 1897 with friends and spent about a month in the castle. They spent a few more days in October 1897. They returned in the summer of 1898, but they sold their mine, the milling equipment, and the castle, and never returned to the town.
Eventually, the castle fell into disrepair until Molly Magee Knudsen, a cousin of Stokes, bought the castle in 1956. The tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The "Castle" is currently owned by HW Trapnell of Austin, NV and Dunsmuir, CA.

Simple Green

Simple Green is a brand of cleaning products produced by Sunshine Makers, Inc. Their best known product is Simple Green All-Purpose Cleaner, which in 2004 totaled sales of at least $5.7 million USD.
It is advertised as an environmentally friendly, non-toxic, and biodegradable cleaner. It received critical attention from environmental safety activists because of the toxicity concerns of 2-butoxyethanol (EGBE), which was in the formula at under 4%.
As of 2013 Simple Green all-purpose cleaner removed 2-butoxyethanol, and has a NFPA/HMIS rating of 0/mininal for Health, Fire, reactivity, and Special. 
The company stands by its safety, stating that it is backed by over $3 million in safety testing.
Environmental Uses.
Simple Green is listed as an approved Surface Washing Agent per the EPA's National Contingency Plan for oil spills since 1990. EPA toxicity testing reports that "Menidia beryllina" and "Mysidopsis bahia" survive slightly better in a 1:10 solution of Simple Green/Crude Oil #2/water solution (LC50 8.30ppm-96hrs and 4.40ppm-48hrs, respectively) than in a Crude Oil #2/water solution (LC50 6.50-96hrs and 3.70ppm-48hrs, respectively).
In 2001, Crystal Simple Green was used to clean up an oil spill in the Baltic Sea. In 2005, laboratory testing on rainbow trout indicated that Crystal Simple Green by itself did not affect the survival of rainbow trout adults or larvae. Crude oil #2 did not affect adults but did increase the mortality rate of larvae to 36%. Crystal Simple Green combined with Crude Oil #2 did not affect adults but did increase the mortality rate of larvae to 46%.
Simple Green has also been used for soil remediation projects.

1 Lincoln Plaza

1 Lincoln Plaza is a mixed-use, commercial and luxury residential condominium building in New York City with 43 floors and 671 units. Construction began in 1971. The building is in the heart of the Lincoln Center neighborhood. Completed and ready for occupancy in 1974, the building is divided into eight floors of commercial space and 36 floors of luxury residential apartments. The roof, which is often considered the 44th Floor is home to the building's private fitness club called Top of the One.
A five-story residential building at 33 West 63rd Street, a tenement constructed in the 1890s owned by Jehiel R. Elyachar, became the target of an effort by Paul Milstein to assemble a group of properties that would become the site of 1 Lincoln Plaza. After lengthy negotiations, Milstein and Elyachar had agreed to a deal in which Milstein would acquire the property for cash, and then agreed to an exchange for a building on the Upper East Side. Though a verbal agreement had been reached, Elyachar insisted that a donation of $100,000 be made to one of the charitable organizations he supported, at which point Milstein walked away and said "You know what, you're going to keep your building". Howard Milstein, Paul's son, called the negotiations as being "among the most glaring examples of someone who overplayed their hand". The surrounding buildings on the site were demolished and 1 Lincoln Plaza was constructed around Elyachar's building at 33 West 63rd Street.
The building has multiple addresses including 1 Lincoln Plaza, 20 West 64th Street, 33 West 63rd Street and 1897 Broadway. Provided a unit number is included, any mail sent to any of the above addresses will reach the required tenant.
In January 2012, actor Nick Santino, a resident, committed suicide soon after euthanizing his pit bull Rocco, due to pressure from what some neighbors told the press was harassment by building management. The condominium board had enacted a ban on pit bulls in 2010, though Santino's dog had been allowed to remain through grandfathering. 
Commercial space.
The building also has commercial tenants. These include two prominent commercial tenants in the entertainment industry: Sesame Workshop (which makes "Sesame Street"), and the prestigious American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP); the headquarters of ASCAP have been at One Lincoln Plaza since 1974.
Appearances in television and movies.
The building can be seen in almost any scene that was filmed in the plaza at Lincoln Center, after 1971, including Ghostbusters.

Steve Farmer is an American guitarist, composer and lyricist best known for his composition with Ted Nugent in 1968 titled "Journey to the Center of the Mind". It was performed by their group The Amboy Dukes. Farmer wrote the lyrics to this iconic hit song, which peaked at #16 in the charts. He also co-wrote with Nugent or self composed, twenty two compositions to help complete the first three albums created by The Amboy Dukes.
Amboy Dukes.
The Dukes first offering was their self titled album "The Amboy Dukes" which charted. It featured their first charting single "Baby, Please Don't Go", an intense cover of a Big Joe Williams song. The second album was "Journey to the Center of the Mind" a psychedelic rock opera that was their highest charting album and produced their most commercially successful single. The third album was "Migration". Although not a commercial success, it showed a refinement of both Farmer's songwriting skills and Nugent's songwriting and guitar skills. All three albums (released by Mainstream Records) featured Farmer touches in words and music that emphasized psychedelic imagery, so central to late sixties pop culture.
New Journey.
In 2000, Farmer completed work on his new millennium "journey". The album is titled "Journey to the Darkside of the Mind" and was released by Saint Thomas Records. Fellow Amboy Dukes member Rick Lober contributed to the album. It was produced by Victor Peraino, who is known for his innovative work on the Mellotron with England's Arthur Brown.

Sweet Basil Building

The Sweet Basil Building, also known as the P. Martin Liquors Building, was a heritage building on the waterfront of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada which was demolished by Halifax developer Armour Group in November 2008 as part of the company’s controversial Waterside Centre Development proposal.
History.
The building, known by the name of its last occupant, a Halifax restaurant, was built in the 1840s. It was a three story wood frame building, the last wooden building on Halifax’s Water Street and was typical of the “Sailortown” buildings which served seafarer’s in Nova Scotia’s Age of Sail. It stood beside the oldest storefront in Halifax, the 1820 Harrington MacDonald-Briggs Building and faced preserved warehouses and shipping offices of Privateer’s Wharf, a National Historic Site. The building served as a sailor’s boarding house, liquor store, confectionary, grocery store and restaurant. The building was rented to a successful Halifax restaurant but Armour group argued that it was uneconomical because the upper floors were not suited for profitable modern office space. The last tenant, the Sweet Basil Bistro, reluctantly left the building after 19 years on the site due to the redevelopment.
Heritage Status and Demolition.
The Sweet Basil Building was designated a municipally protected heritage building in 1981. It was also a nationally recognized building under the federal Historic Places program. However Armour Group overturned the designation in court in 2008 arguing that it was designated in error. 
Armour Group wished to use the land to build a nine story office tower called the Waterside Centre, which involved the demolition of six heritage buildings, although the facades of some would be reconstructed at street level. The project faced widespread public opposition at municipal hearings in September 2008 and was narrowly rejected by the council of Halifax Regional Municipality on October 21. However Armour Group announced that they would appeal the decision to Nova Scotia’s Utility and Review Board, on October 31, the same day as his company began demolition of the Sweet Basil Building|. The Board overturned Council's decision and approved the controversial office tower on March 26, 2009 and Halifax Council voted not to further oppose the development and or try and save the remaining buildings on April 7, 2009.
After boarding windows and demolishing exterior parts of the building on October 21, the entire building was demolished early Sunday morning, November 2, 2008. Promoters of downtown development such as the Halifax Chamber of Commerce noted that the demolition and disputed development highlight the need for a more streamlined development process. Heritage advocates such as Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia pointed to the demolition as a sign of the weakness of municipal heritage designations and the lack of any heritage districts in downtown Halifax.

Pinsker's inequality

In information theory, Pinsker's inequality, named after its inventor Mark Semenovich Pinsker, is an inequality that bounds the total variation distance (or statistical distance) in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
The inequality is tight up to constant factors.
Pinsker's inequality states that, if "P" and "Q" are two probability distributions, then
where
is the total variation distance (or statistical distance) between "P" and "Q" and
is the Kullback-Leibler divergence in nats.
Pinsker first proved the inequality with a worse constant. The inequality in the above form was proved independently by Kullback, Csiszár, and Kemperman. 
An inverse of the inequality cannot hold: for every formula_4, there are distributions with formula_5 but formula_6.

USS Waldo County (LST-1163)

USS "Waldo County" (LST-1163), previously USS "LST-1163", was a United States Navy landing ship tank (LST) in commission from 1953 to 1970, and which then saw non-commissioned Military Sealift Command service as USNS "Waldo County" (T-LST-1163) from 1972 to 1973.
Construction and commissioning.
"Waldo County" was laid down as USS "LST-1163" on 4 August 1952 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation. She was launched on 17 March 1953, sponsored by Mrs. C. Richard Shaeffner, and commissioned on 17 September 1953 with Lieutenant Commander Robert H. Steinkellner in command.
Operations in U.S. waters and Caribbean 1953–1955.
"LST-1163" departed Pascagoula on 14 October 1953 and steamed via Key West, Florida, Florida; Port Everglades, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina, to her permanent home port, Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She arrived at Little Creek on 25 October 1953. Exercises and shakedown training occupied the remainder of 1953 and the first few months of 1954.
On 14 June 1954, "LST-1163" departed Little Creek for Morehead City, North Carolina, to embark United States Marines for amphibious exercises. She arrived at Morehead City on the 15 June 1954, loaded troops and equipment, and got underway on 16 June 1954 for Vieques Island, located near Puerto Rico in the West Indies. "LST-1163" reached Vieques Island on 21 June 1954 and conducted amphibious training until 1 July 1954, when she headed back to Little Creek. She arrived at Little Creek on 5 July 1954 and remained there eight days before entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 13 July 1954. She left the shipyard on 6 August 1954 and returned to Little Creek to resume duty with the Amphibious Force, United States Atlantic Fleet. For the remainder of the year, "LST-1163" conducted a series of amphibious exercises, mostly at Vieques Island, but she also participated in one cold-weather exercise at Hamilton Inlet on the coast of Labrador in Newfoundland, Canada, in November 1954.
On 18 January 1955, "LST-1163" entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for her first major overhaul. She emerged from the yard, revitalized, on 20 May 1955 and resumed duty with the Amphibious Force. On 1 July 1955, "LST-1163" was renamed USS "Waldo County" (LST-1163). Through the summer of 1955, "Waldo County" remained close to or in Little Creek.
First Mediterranean deployment 1955–1956.
On 24 August 1955, "Waldo County" departed the Norfolk, Virginia, area for her first overseas deployment. After stops at Bordeaux in France, Port Lyautey in Morocco, and at Gibraltar, she joined the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean late in September 1955. For the next four months, she ranged the length and breadth of the Mediterranean Sea conducting Sixth Fleet amphibious exercises and making port visits. On 25 January 1956, she departed Port Lyautey on her way home. She returned to Norfolk on 6 February 1956 and resumed operations with the United States Second Fleet.
Operations 1956–1970.
In her first two years of active service, "Waldo County" established a pattern of operations which endured until the end of 1964. She alternated five Mediterranean deployments with periods of duty out of Little Creek conducting amphibious training at such places as Vieques Island, Onslow Beach in North Carolina, and at various locations in the Canadian Maritime Provinces. During her second Mediterranean deployment, which lasted from August 1957 to February 1958, she acted as a unit of a contingency force established in the eastern Mediterranean during civil unrest in Lebanon.
In 1959 the Waldo County made her first and only Top Secret Mission. A Top Secret crypto message ordered her and two sister ship LST's to proceed from Little Creek to Quantico Marine Base for further orders. At Quantico
the LST's on-loaded two battalions of South Vietnamese marines and US Marine trainers and proceeded to the Caribbean to hold amphibious landing exercises for several weeks. At the conclusion the Marines were dropped off at Camp Lejeune. Not too many years later the U.S. was deeply involved in the Vietnam war. 
The remaining three deployments were more routine in nature, consisting only of training missions and port visits. Between her third and fourth deployments to the Sixth Fleet, she earned the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal in November and December 1961 when she cruised Cuban waters as a part of another contingency force established in response to a wave of what the United States considered to be terrorist actions by the Cuban government following the abortive April 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. Otherwise, the periods between deployments consisted entirely of routine Second Fleet operations, primarily amphibious training missions at the previously named locations.
"Waldo County" returned to Little Creek from her fifth and last Mediterranean cruise on 17 November 1964. At that point, she began a new phase of her career. No longer did she deploy to the Sixth Fleet. For the remaining six years of her active career, she confined her operations to the United States East Coast and the West Indies. The ubiquitous amphibious exercises predominated, but, on two occasions, she did perform special missions. In May and June 1965, she again earned the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal when she joined another contingency force in the West Indies during a period of extreme internal unrest in the Dominican Republic quelled by the intervention of forces of the Organization of American States. In 1966, she qualified for that award again by returning to the Dominican Republic once more.
From that time on, "Waldo County" broke her routine of U.S. East Coast – West Indies operations only one time. In January 1970, she steamed to the Panama Canal and transited it for a brief series of landing exercises on the Pacific Ocean side of the Panamanian Isthmus. She retransited the canal on 2 February 1970 and resumed operations in the West Indies. Normal operations occupied her time until September 1970, at which time she began preparations for inactivation.
Decommissioning, reserve, and Military Sealift Command service 1970–1973.
"Waldo County" was decommissioned on 21 December 1970 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange Texas. She remained there until May 1972, at which time she was reactivated for non-commissioned service as a cargo ship with a civil service crew with the Military Sealift Command (MSC) as the United States Naval Ship USNS "Waldo County" (T-LST-1163). She operated under MSC control for about 18 months before being sticken from the Navy List on 1 November 1973.
Layup and transfer to Peru.
"Waldo County" name was stricken from the Navy List on 1 November 1973, and she was transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay at Benicia, California.
On 7 August 1984, "Waldo County" and three of her sister ships – USS "Traverse County" (LST-1160), USS "Walworth County" (LST-1164), and USS "Washoe County" (LST-1165) – were leased to Peru, and "Waldo County" was commissioned into service in the Peruvian Navy as "Pisco" (BAP-142) on 4 March 1985. Peru renewed the lease on all four ships in August 1989 and August 1994, and the United States sold all four outright to Peru on 26 April 1999 under the Security Assistance Program; all four were struck from the U.S. Naval Register on the day of the sale.

2008 Turkey UFO sightings

The 2008 Turkey UFO sightings were a series of videotaped and documented UFO sightings by the 42-year-old Yalcin Yalman, a night guard in Turkey. He claims they occurred between May and September 2008, mostly while the sky was dark (between 8:00pm and 5:00am), though some of the video is taken at dawn, out over the Sea of Marmara. According to the United Kingdom's "Daily Telegraph", Turkish scientists consider this case to be a computer generated hoax. 
Summary.
Yalcin Yalman, who had previously filmed footage of UFO sightings in Turkey in 2007, among many residents, witnessed one or more UFOs on several nights during the months of May–September 2008. This video, like the last, was shot over Yeni Kent Compound in the evening to morning hours.
Yalman provided the Sirius UFO Space Science Research Center with about two and a half hours of footage from the four-month period. The Center went through the footage frame-by-frame and interviewed people who claimed to have witnessed one or more of the incidents. The chairman of the UFO Research Center, Haktan Akdogan, said that "after conducting all of the analysis we came to the conclusion that this video footage is 100 per cent genuine." Akdogan also said that it was concluded that the objects sighted, showing physical and material structures, are not airplanes or helicopters, nor are they any kind of space phenomenon (i.e. planets, meteorites etc...), nor are they the result of natural or atmospheric disturbances. The Sirius UFO Center is also optimistic about supposed evidence of alien life contained in some of the videos. Akdogan said that, in addition to the metallic structures of the UFOs sighted, "in the close-up of some footages of the objects, entities in them can be distinctly made out."
Akdogan added, "now it is a time for world governments to acknowledge the reality of UFOs."

Make Believe (Jerome Kern song)

"Make Believe" is a show tune from the 1927 Broadway musical "Show Boat" with music by Jerome Kern and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II.
In the show, it is first sung as a duet by the characters Gaylord Ravenal, a handsome riverboat gambler, and the teenage Magnolia Hawks, an aspiring performer and daughter of the show boat captain, soon after their meeting in Act I. It reveals that they are smitten with each other almost immediately upon meeting and sets the tone for the contrasts between the ideal “make believe” world of the young lovers and the harsh realities of life that they will encounter throughout the story.
In Act II, Ravenal sings it to his little daughter Kim, just before he deserts her and Magnolia because of his compulsive gambling. He tells Kim to sing it whenever she is lonely and to pretend he has never been away.
The song was introduced by Norma Terris and Howard Marsh. It was not performed in the 1929 part-talkie film of "Show Boat". For film, it was sung by Irene Dunne and Allan Jones in the 1936 version of the musical, by Tony Martin and Kathryn Grayson in the 1946 Kern biopic "Till the Clouds Roll By", and by Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson in the 1951 version of "Show Boat".
In the 1951 film, instead of singing it to Kim just before he leaves, Ravenal sings it to her when he meets her for the first time after being away for several years - the exact reverse of the situation in the original show and the 1936 film version. He has finally returned and now asks her to pretend that he has never been away.
The song has since become a standard and been recorded by numerous musical artists, including Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford, Peggy Lee & Patrice Munsel.
Barbra Streisand recorded the song for The Third Album.

KSYR

KSYR was an alternative rock music radio station in Benton, Louisiana and was known as "The Buzz". The Buzz was created as an alternative rock addition to Shreveport, and competed mainly with local hard rock station, 99x. The Buzz brought a refreshing new style of music to the area, featuring many bands that were not played on 99x or any other station. On Saturday nights, The Buzz was transformed into "Club Buzz," where all the songs played were techno-influenced remixes of the normal alternative songs that it played. The Buzz also featured a variety of interaction with listeners as well as original contests. Weekly contests featured were "The Free Buzz at 4:20", "Thumbs Up or the Finger", "The Buzz Rewind", and the short lived "Buzz Bits", where listeners could call in and say whatever they wanted, within reason. Its "Too Cool for Tool" contest was also original, with each contestant sitting on a large tub of ice, and whoever lasting the longest receiving a pair of Tool concert tickets, along with a "Tool"-box full of Tool SWAG. The Buzz came to an abrupt end in 2004, in circumstances where it was literally there one minute and gone the next. No reason was ever stated for the cancellation of the station, and the format was quickly switched to Christmas music until the start of the new year. Since The Buzz, the station has been a light rock station and its current format is Spanish radio.
KSYR started on the 95.7 which now contains the oldies format that was on this frequency. On 95.7 it was first known as country. Then in approximately 97 it flipped to Star 95.7, an Adult Contemporary station claimed to sit in between the CHR of 94.5 and soft rock of 96.5. It played hit music without the rap, sleepy music or hard rock trying to appeal to the core working audience. However, it flipped to a phythmic top 40 as Power 95.7. The music selection mixed boy bands with the flourishing urban music scene puting it between KMJJ, KBTT and the more rock leaning top 40 at KRUF. Ultimately in 2001 it became the Buzz and moved to its present frequency.

Variable Control Voice Actuator

The term Variable Control Voice Actuator (VCVA) refers to a digital recording technology developed by Olympus, which is implemented in many of their digital voice recorders. It prevents the recording of silence, so pauses in a speaker's dictation do not waste time, power or recording space.
Function.
When the microphone picks up an arbitrary level of sound, the VCVA initiates recording, and when volume detected by that microphone dips down below said threshold the VCVA stops recording.

Viewed

Viewed (4 October 2003 – 18 April 2010) was an Australian Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 148th Melbourne Cup on 4 November 2008. Prior to the Cup, Viewed won the AJC Listed Japan Racing Association (JRA) Plate on April 30, 2008 and two months later he qualified by winning the Group 2 Brisbane Cup on 9 June 2008.
Racing record.
2008 Melbourne Cup.
In the Melbourne Cup on November 4, Viewed defeated the Luca Cumani-trained Bauer in a photo finish. The finish was so close that the electronic timing devices, which are placed inside the saddle cloths, recorded that Bauer had completed the course one-hundredth of a second faster than Viewed. Viewed was trained by Bart Cummings and was ridden by Blake Shinn. It was Shinn's first Melbourne Cup winner and the 12th for Cummings. It was the fourth time Cummings had won the Cup in partnership with Dato Tan Chin Nam, the owner. Viewed was an outsider in the Melbourne Cup, and paid $41.00 on the totalisator in New South Wales.
2009 Caulfield Cup.
Following the Melbourne Cup, Viewed failed to break through in four starts during the autumn however these runs included a 4th in the Group 2 Apollo Stakes, 4th in the Group 1 Chipping Norton Stakes, 2nd in the Group 1 Ranvet Stakes and 3rd in Group 1 The BMW. Viewed returned in the spring to win the Group 1 Caulfield Cup on 17 October 2009. He was ridden by Brad Rawiller, and came from the tail of the field. Viewed was the first original topweight in history to win the Caulfield Cup, and the first Melbourne Cup winner to win the following year's Caulfield Cup since Rising Fast in 1955. Viewed defeated one of his stablemates, Roman Emperor, and was Cummings's seventh winner of the race.
2009 Melbourne Cup.
After his victory in the Caulfield Cup, Viewed then ran in the Group 1 Mackinnon Stakes on Victoria Derby Day and finished 3rd and then finished 7th in the Melbourne Cup behind the eventual winner Shocking.
Death.
On 18 April 2010, Viewed was euthanised following complications from a twisted bowel.

Orochi (film)

Synopsis.
The film tells the story of a samurai who falls on hard times due to misunderstandings and explains the plots of his enemies. Such explanations superbly depict the absurdity of the samurai's unjust world, making this work pertinent even in present day.
Analysis.
The kinetic sword fighting scenes masterfully performed by Bandō were quite novel in an age when kabuki-style, leisurely and dignified movies were the norm. This style has been passed onto modern chambara films. Additionally, the sword fighting style's aesthetic value is slightly lost in "Orochi" due to the pace at which the fight scenes were filmed (fast forward motion). Due to the kabuki style, the makeup on the characters transformed them into almost identical representations of Ukiyo-e (woodblock prints), a major Japanese art form.
Trivia.
The original title of the movie was supposed to be "Outlaw," but the Japanese censors and police banned the title, because the depiction of an outlaw as a hero was seen as a very dangerous suggestion. The title was later changed to "Serpent," describing how Bando Tsumasaburo wiggles when he fights back, and how even in death, a serpent still looks terrifying. Confused, the censors allowed the title.

History of occupational therapy in New Zealand

The early use of occupation to support, treat and rehabilitate people in New Zealand is evident in services for returned soldiers after World War 1 ((Hobcroft 1949)). There are glimpses in mental health services during the 1930s too (Skilton 1981). However the first qualified occupational therapist, Margaret Buchanan, arrived in New Zealand in 1941 (Buchanan 1941). Initially employed in the then Auckland Mental Hospital she was rapidly involved not only in the development of occupational therapy services there, but also the development of the first training programmes and advice to government. Initially those trained had previous health or education backgrounds (Skilton 1981). A formal two-year training programm was established by 1940 (NZNJ 1940), and state registration provided for in the Occupational Therapy Act 1949 with the New Zealand Occupational Therapy Registration Board 1950 but since replaced by the Occupational Therapy Board of NZ through the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003. From its early services in mental health and returned serviceman settings occupational therapy expanded into general rehabilitation, work with children with disabilities and services for the elderly (Wilson 2004, p. 88). 
Educational programmes moved from the health sector to the education sector in 1971 (New Zealand Occupational Therapy Registration Board 1970b 17 July). OT career training is now provided by the Schools of Occupational Therapy at the Auckland University of Technology and Otago Polytechnic in Dunedin. An advanced diploma in occupational therapy was first made available in 1989 (Packer 1991) and bachelor programmes have been available since the 1990s. However, it was not until a review of the Education Act that it was possible for masters degree programmes to be made available, as they now are through both schools . The first New Zealand occupational therapist to complete a PhD in the country in a programme related to occupational therapy was Linda Robertson who completed her PhD in 1994 (NZJOT 1996). The development of distance education technology has enabled large numbers of therapists to participate in post-graduate distance education. 
An association for practitioners was formed in 1948 (New Zealand Registered Occupational Therapists Association 1949) and since renamed as the New Zealand Association of Occupational Therapists (Inc) or NZAOT. The NZAOT provides a bi-annual conference, representation at government levels, a journal and a monthly newsletter.

The Masked Avengers' prank on Sarah Palin

On November 1, 2008, American vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin fell prey to a prank call by the Masked Avengers, a Quebecer radio comedy duo, who tricked Palin into believing she was talking to French President Nicolas Sarkozy. During the conversation, the fake Sarkozy talked to Palin about foreign policy, hunting, and the 2008 U.S. presidential election. After it was revealed to Palin that the call was a prank, she handed the phone to one of her assistants who told the comedy duo "I have to let you go" and hung up.
Both the McCain and Obama campaigns released light-hearted statements about the prank. However, a McCain campaign advisor said that behind the scenes, aides and advisors to the campaign were not happy that the pranksters were able to lie their way up to Palin, or with the publicity Palin received because of the call.
Background.
The Masked Avengers, a Canadian radio duo from Montreal, Quebec radio station CKOI-FM, had become notorious for making prank calls to celebrities. Disc jockeys and comedians Sébastien Trudel and Marc-Antoine Audette had previously pranked celebrities like business mogul Bill Gates, golfer Tiger Woods, singer Britney Spears, and French president Nicolas Sarkozy.
Sarah Palin was the Republican governor of Alaska. On August 29, 2008, John McCain announced that she would be his running mate in the 2008 presidential election against Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Critics of Palin voiced their concern what they saw as her lack of foreign policy experience, especially after an interview with Katie Couric of the "CBS Evening News" where Palin was criticized by many for her answer to a question about her "foreign policy credentials".
Preparation.
Marc-Antoine Audette said that it took the duo about four or five days of calls to Palin's staff to finally be able to talk to her. They claimed that they started by talking to low-level people in Alaska and made their way up through Palin's campaign staff. Audette said that at first they didn't think their prank would work, calling it a "mission impossible". He claimed that "after about a dozen calls", the duo "started to realize it prank call might work, because her Palin's staff didn't know the name of the French President. They asked us to spell it." Audette and Trudel credited their ability to make their way up through Palin's staff to sounding convincing during the first few calls, always arranging to place the call at a set time, and not leaving a contact number. The four days of calls needed to talk to Palin was quicker compared to some of their other pranks. Audette and Trudel said that it took them two months to talk to Paul McCartney and one to talk to Bill Gates, but only two days to prank Britney Spears.
Conversation.
Finally, on November 1, the Masked Avengers were able to talk to Palin. The call began with Trudel, who claimed to be an aide to Sarkozy named "Frank l’ouvrier", talking to an assistant to Palin who identifies herself as "Lexi". Lexi puts Palin on the line, who says "hello" only to realize that Trudel is still on the other line. Trudel tells Palin to hold on for a moment while he gives the phone to Sarkozy, who is really Audette. Palin can be heard talking to someone in the room about when to hand Palin the phone. Audette then begins to speak and a somewhat extended conversation ensues.
After Audette reveals that the call was a prank by CKOI in Montreal, Palin leaves the phone and can be heard in the background telling her aides that the call was "just a radio station prank". Audette is still on the line and jokes that "if one voice can change the world for Obama, one Viagra can change the world for McCain." One of Palin's assistants picks up the phone and says "I’m sorry, I have to let you go. Thank you."
Reaction.
In an e-mail, Palin spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt wrote that "Governor Palin was mildly amused to learn that she had joined the ranks of heads of state, including President Sarkozy, and other celebrities in being targeted by these pranksters. C'est la vie." When asked by reporters about the conversation, Palin said that she would "keep a sense of humor through all of this, just as we McCain campaign did with "SNL" of her, too." She added that "you've got to have some levity in all this."
Barack Obama senior advisor Robert Gibbs jokingly said in an interview that "I'm glad we Obama campaign check out our calls before we hand the phone to Barack Obama."
The Masked Avengers received a sudden burst of fame from the prank. They gave more than 300 interviews about the conversation, and were even flown to New York City by CBS to appear on "The Early Show". In an interview, Marc-Antoine Audette and Sébastien Trudel said that they found it "pretty disturbing to see that idiots like us can go through to a vice-presidential candidate", and claimed that they were just "two stupid comedians with a bad French accent." The Masked Avengers also admitted that the call was "probably the biggest we've ever done." When recalling the experience, Audette said that "once we [Audette and Trudel started making jokes, she didn't seem to mind, and she didn't seem to be aware of the fact we were making jokes", which according to Audette was when "we were like 'Oh my God this is gonna be long'". The duo also said that they weren't trying to make any political statements with the call, they just like to take high-profile people to task.
Impact.
After McCain and Palin were defeated in the general election, a Republican campaign advisor told "The New York Times" that the McCain Campaign was not happy about the prank, which caused friction between McCain and Palin. McCain and his advisors were allegedly upset that Palin did not tell them beforehand that she planned to speak with who she thought was Nicolas Sarkozy. McCain strategist Steve Schmidt called a meeting and demanded to know who let Palin talk to the fake Sarkozy without checking with senior advisors first. Steve Biegun, one of Palin's aides admitting to vetting the call without speaking to campaign advisors or the U.S. State Department, told the "Los Angeles Times" that "No one's going to beat me up more than I beat myself up for setting up the governor like that."

History of occupational therapy in America

In the history of occupational therapy in America, occupational therapy began as a profession in the United States in 1917 with the founding of the Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy (now, The American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc.). The creation of the society was impelled by a belief in the curative properties of human occupation (or everyday purposeful activity). It had previously been employed as part of the moral treatment movement in the large state-supported institutions for mental illness that were widespread in the United States. Occupational therapy has played a prominent role in epidemics, providing treatment for patients with tuberculosis, polio, and HIV/AIDS. In 1975, following the enactment of legislation known as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (PL 94-142), thousands of occupational therapists were employed by public schools to provide therapeutic services (known as related services) to enable children with disabilities to participate in regular school settings. Originally, therapists from approved training programs were certified, or registered by the American Occupational Therapy Association. A baccalaureate degree was required for certification beginning in the 1940s. Fifty years later, accredited programs were required to be at the Master's degree level. The 1990s saw the evolution of doctoral programs in occupational therapy. Educational programs in occupational therapy are now accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education, and national certification is granted under the auspices of the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy. More recently, a new discipline within occupational therapy has opened up known as occupational science. Many students in 5-year masters program now receive their undergraduate degree in this discipline and go on to receive a Masters degree in occupational therapy during their 5th year.
Educational requirements.
Occupational therapy practitioners are skilled professionals whose education includes the study of human growth and development with specific emphasis on the physical, emotional, psychological, sociocultural, cognitive and environmental components of illness and injury.
Education in the USA.
Until 2007, registered occupational therapists (OTRs) practicing in the field needed only a bachelor of science degree in occupational therapy. However, since 2007, all occupational therapists have been required to enter the field with a master's (M.A., M.S., or MOT) or professional doctoral degree (OTD). A certified occupational therapy assistant (COTA) generally earns an associate degree.
A master’s degree or higher in occupational therapy is the minimum requirement for entry into the field. In 2012, the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) had accredited approximately 300 occupational therapy and occupational therapy assistant programs in the United States and its territories. Most schools have full-time programs, although a growing number are offering weekend or part-time programs as well. Coursework in occupational therapy programs include the physical, biological, and behavioral sciences as well as the application of occupational therapy theory and skills. Programs also require the completion of 6 months of supervised fieldwork.
People considering this profession should take high school courses in biology, chemistry, physics, health, art, and the social sciences. College admissions offices also look favorably on paid or volunteer experience in the health care field. Relevant undergraduate majors include biology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, liberal arts, and anatomy.
Upon successful completion of at least two two supervised clinical internships (fieldwork), graduates must pass a national examination administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT). Occupational therapy is regulated in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Regulation varies from licensure (the strongest form of regulation) to title protection or trademark law (the weakest form of regulation).

<doc id="20064790" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20064790" title="1987 Major League Baseball Draft">
1987 Major League Baseball Draft

The Major League Baseball Draft is the process by which Major League Baseball (MLB) teams select athletes to play for their organization. High school seniors, college juniors and seniors, and anyone who had never played under a professional contract were considered eligible for the draft. The 1987 MLB Draft took place as a conference call to the Commissioner of Baseball's office in New York from June 2–4. As opposed to the National Football League Draft which appeared on ESPN, no network aired the MLB Draft.
The American League (AL) and the National League (NL) alternated picks throughout the first round; because an NL team drafted first in the 1986 MLB Draft, an AL team had the first selection in 1987. Finishing 67–95, the Seattle Mariners had the worst record in the AL and thus obtained the first overall selection. The second selection went to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had the worst record in the NL.
With the first overall pick, the Mariners drafted Ken Griffey, Jr. from Moeller High School. Griffey, Jr. became a 13-time All-Star and helped Seattle make its first postseason appearance in franchise history. Mark Merchant, the second overall pick, however, never played in a major league game. Two years after he was drafted, the Pirates traded Merchant to Seattle. Chicago White Sox' first overall selection Jack McDowell won the 1993 Cy Young Award as Chicago made a League Championship Series appearance that year. The total number of athletes drafted, 1,263, broke a record for the most players ever chosen in a draft. In total, 27 All-Stars were selected in 1987, although not all signed a professional contract. , no players from the draft have been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
Background.
As with prior drafts, the team with the worst overall record from the previous season selected first, with teams from the AL and NL alternating picks. If two or more teams had the same record, the team with the worse record from two seasons prior would draft higher. Because the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL selected first overall in 1986 Major League Baseball Draft, an AL team had the first pick in the 1987 draft. The final two selections in the first round both came from American League teams, as the AL had two more organizations than the NL.
The date of the draft was set for June 2–4, and would occur as a conference call to the Commissioner of Baseball's office in New York. Unlike the 1987 NFL Draft, which aired on ESPN, no network televised the MLB draft. High school seniors, college juniors and seniors, and anyone who had never played under a professional contract were considered eligible to be drafted. For the first time, junior college players would also be included in the June draft; in years past, teams would select junior college players in a separate draft.
Selections could be transferred or added if a team signed a certain type of free agent: the Elias Sports Bureau ranked players as either type-A (top 30 percent of all players), type-B (31 percent to 50 percent), or type-C (51 percent to 60 percent) players, based on the athlete's performance over the past two seasons. If a "type-A" player became a free agent, the team that lost the type-A player would receive the first-round draft pick from the team that signed the player, as well as a "sandwich pick" between the first and second rounds. If a "type-B" became a free agent, the team that lost him would receive a second-round pick from the team that signed the player. If a "type-C" became a free agent, the team that lost him would receive a compensation pick between the second and third rounds. The top 13 selections were considered "protected picks" and exempt from this rule.
With a record of 67–95, the Seattle Mariners ended the 1986 Major League Baseball season with the worst record in the AL and thus obtained the first overall selection. The Mariners never had a winning record in the twelve years since the franchise's creation (their best winning percentage was .457, accomplished in 1984 and 1985), and during the 1986 season, changed managers three times. In the NL, the Pirates finished with the league's worst record for the second year in a row and were given the second overall pick. The 1986 World Series champion New York Mets drafted third-to-last, with the runner-up Boston Red Sox selecting last.
Other players to reach MLB.
The following players were drafted outside of the first two rounds and played in at least one major league game:
Aftermath.
The Kansas City Royals had the most picks of any team, with 74; following the Royals, the Toronto Blue Jays made 71, and the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets made 61 apiece. The total number of players drafted, 1,263, broke a record for the most players ever selected in a draft. The previous record of 1,162 was set during the 1967 draft. The California Angels drafted the fewest future MLB players, with only four of their draftees appearing in an MLB game, while the Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers both drafted 13 future MLB players, the most of any team.
With their first overall pick, the Mariners selected Ken Griffey, Jr., an outfielder from Moeller High School. Over his 22-year career, Griffey, Jr. was elected to thirteen All-Star games, won seven Silver Slugger Awards, and helped Seattle make their first playoff appearance as a franchise during the 1995 season. Mark Merchant, whom the Pirates drafted second overall, never played in an MLB game; two years after they drafted him, the Pirates traded Merchant to Seattle. The Pirates made the playoffs for three consecutive seasons from 1990–1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series all three years.

Cuan Dixia is a famous small hamlet in Mentou Gou district, south of Beijing. Cuan (Chinese: 爨) means kitchen range in old Chinese. In the year 1958, it was simplified as Chuan (Chinese: 川). The reason why this hamlet got this name is that the host would like to be away from chill. It is famous because it has a history of 400 years during the Ming Dynasty. At that time, the ancestor of this hamlet migrated from Shan Xi, a province is the west of Beijing, to this place. It is a stronghold in the way from Beijing to Shan Xi. The Surname of all of the villagers living here is Han, which means that they share the same ancestor. Experiencing hundreds of years, the houses here still maintain the style of Ming and Qing Dynasty. Therefore, it becomes an attractive historical site, where thousands of people come here from its surrounding cities. Up till now, there are 500 houses left, and the stone carving, brick carving and calligraphy and painting are everywhere. The common figures are bats, pied magpie, peony, water lily, etc. And each of them has its typical meaning. People who are interested in Chinese traditional architecture and fairy tales could come here and have a look.

Thick film technology

Thick film technology is used to produce electronic devices such as surface mount devices, hybrid integrated circuits and sensors.
Thick film circuits are widely used in the automotive industry, both in sensors, e.g. mixture of fuel/air, pressure sensors, engine and gearbox controls, sensor for releasing airbags, ignitors to airbags; common is that high reliability is required, often extended temperature range also along massive thermocycling of circuits without failure. 
The manufacture of such devices is an additive process involving deposition of several successive layers of conductor, resistors and dielectric layers onto an electrically insulating substrate using a screen-printing process. A typical thick film process would consist of the following stages:
Lasering of substrates.
Most used substrates are made of 96% Alumina Al2O3. Alumina is very hard and not very machinable, therefore lasering of the material is the most efficient way to machine it. The thick film process is also a process of minuazation where one substrates normally contain many units (final circuits), with the lasering it is possible to scribe, profile and drill holes. Scribing is a lasering process where a line of laser pulses are fire into the material and 30-50% of the material is removed, this weakens the substrate, after all other process are done to build the thick film circuit the substrates can easily be divided into single units.
Profiling are for example used lot in the sensor, where a circuit need to fit round tubes or other different complex shapes.
Drilling of holes, provide via between the two sides of the substrate, normally hole sizes are in the range 0.15-0.2 mm.
Lasering before processing the substrates has a cost advantage to lasering or dicing using diamond saw after processing.
Ink preparation.
Inks for electrodes, terminals, resistors, dielectric layers etc. are commonly prepared by mixing the metal or ceramic powders required with an organic vehicle to produce a paste for screen-printing. To achieve a homogeneous ink the mixed components of the ink may be passed through a three roll mill. Alternatively, ready made inks may be obtained from one of the many companies offering products for the thick film technologist.
Screen-printing.
Screen-printing is the process of pushing an ink through a patterned woven mesh screen or stencil using a squeegee.
Drying/Curing.
After allowing a period of time after printing for settling of the ink to occur, each layer of ink that is deposited is usually dried at a moderately high temperature (50 to 200 °C) to evaporate the liquid component of the ink and fix the layer temporarily in position on the substrate so that it can be handled or stored before final processing. For inks based on polymers and some solder pastes that cure at these temperatures this may be the final step that is required. Some inks also require curing by exposure to UV light.
Firing.
For many of the metal, ceramic and glass inks used in thick film processes a high temperature (usually greater than 300°C) firing is required to fix the layers in position permanently on the substrate.
Laser trimming of resistors.
After firing, the substrate resistors are trimmed to the correct value. This process is named Laser trimming. Many chip resistors are made using thick film technology. Large substrates are printed with resistors fired, divided into small chips and these are then terminated, so they can be soldered on the PCB board. With laser trimming two modes are used; either passive trimming, where each resistor is trimmed to a specific value and tolerance, or active trimming, where the feedback is used to adjust to a specific voltage, frequency or response by laser trimming the resistors on the circuit while powered up.
Mounting of capacitors semiconductors.
The development of the SMD process actually evolves from the thick film process. Also mounting of naked dies (the actual silicon chip without encapsulation) and wire bonding is a standard process, this provides the basis for minituarization of the circuits as all the extra encapsulation is not necessary.
Separation of elements.
This step is often necessary because many components are produced on one substrate at the same time. Thus, some means of separating the components from each other is required. This step may be achieved by wafer dicing.
Integration of devices.
At this stage the devices may require integrating with other electronic components, usually in the form of a printed circuit board. This may be achieved by wire bonding or soldering.

St. Audoen's Church, Dublin

St. Audoen's Church is the church of the parish of St. Audoen in the Church of Ireland, located south of the River Liffey at Cornmarket in Dublin, Ireland. This was close to the centre of the medieval city. The parish is in the Diocese of Dublin and Glendalough. St. Audoen's is the oldest parish church in Dublin and still used as such. There is a Roman Catholic church of the same name adjacent called St Audoen's Catholic Church, Dublin.
Church.
The church is named after St. Ouen (or Audoen) of Rouen (Normandy), a saint who lived in the seventh century and was dedicated to him by the Anglo-Normans, who arrived in Dublin after 1172. It was erected in 1190, possibly on the site of an older church dedicated to St. Columcille, dating to the seventh century. Shortly afterwards the nave was lengthened (but also made narrower) and a century later a chancel was added.
In 1430 King Henry VI authorised the erection of a chantry here, to be dedicated to St. Anne. Its founders and successors were to be called the Guild or Fraternity of St. Anne, usually called Saint Anne's Guild. Six separate altars were set up in this chapel and were in constant use, financed by the wealthier parishioners. In 1485 Sir Roland Fitz-Eustace, Earl Portlester, erected a new chapel next to the nave, in gratitude for his preservation from shipwreck near the site.
The turbulent events of the 16th century had its effects on the upkeep of the church and in 1630 the church was declared to be in a decrepit state. The Archbishop, Lancelot Bulkeley, complained that "there is a guild there called St. Anne's Guild that hath swallowed upp all the church meanes" (although chantries and guilds were suppressed during the Reformation in England and their property taken over by the king, in Ireland they survived, with varying vicissitudes, for many years). 
Strenuous efforts were made over the next few years to repair the roof, steeple and pillars of the building, and the guild was ordered to contribute its share. Funds were low - there were only sixteen Protestant houses in the parish. In 1671 Michael Boyle,the Church of Ireland Primate, ordered the "annoyance of the buttermilke market" under St. Audoen's to be closed. In 1673 an order was made to remove the tombs and tombstones from the church "to preserve the living from being injured by the dead". St. Anne's Guild, which had managed to secret away its extensive properties after the Reformation, and which had remained under Roman Catholic control, never did give up its holdings, despite several investigations and court orders lasting until 1702.
Although many repairs were carried out to the church and tower over the centuries, finance for the maintenance of the structures was always a problem, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries. By 1825, the church building itself was in a ruinous state (as reported by G. N. Wright) and "very few Protestants" remained in the parish. As the finance to carry out substantial repairs was not available, parts of the church were closed off or unroofed. As a consequence many ancient tombs gradually crumbled and memorials were removed or rendered illegible by exposure to the weather.
Parish.
St. Audoen's parish was once the most wealthy within the city and the church was for hundreds of years frequented on state occasions by the Lord Mayor and Corporation. At its heyday, the church was closely connected with the Guilds of the city and "was accounted the best in Dublin for the greater number of Aldermen and Worships of the city living in the Parish" (Richard Stanihurst, 1568). The Tanners' Guild was located in the tower and the Bakers' Guild (Saint Anne's Guild) in a "college" adjoining the church.
In 1467 St. Audoen's was made a prebendary of St. Patrick's Cathedral by Archbishop Michael Tregury. 
In July 1536 George Browne arrived in Ireland as Archbishop of Dublin, and a few years later he energetically pushed through the wishes of Henry VIII to be recognized as supreme head of the Irish church. About 1544 the vicar of St. Audoen's became the nominee of the Crown. In 1547 the assets of the parish were appropriated by the state church that was established following the English Reformation (more particularly the Tudor conquest of Ireland). 
Queen Mary I, soon after her accession in 1553, restored by Charter the Cathedral of St. Patrick. The Prebendary of St. Audoen named in this Charter of Restoration was, in 1555, Robert Daly. However, when Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne she nominated him Bishop of Kildare. From then on, all Roman Catholic ceremonies in the church ceased.
After the Reformation the majority of parishioners remained loyal to the Roman Catholic church, and in 1615 a new Roman Catholic parish of St. Audoen's was established. However the Catholics were obliged to hold their services in secret, mainly in nearby Cook Street. Later in the century celebration of Mass was forbidden and bishops and priests deported, imprisoned or executed. This troubled period for Catholics lasted until the beginning of the 19th century. Meanwhile the now Protestant church and parish of St. Audoen had to struggle through the seventeenth century and began to decline. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, following a trend in several inner-city parishes, many of the wealthy parish residents moved out to the suburbs, a process that was hastened by the Act of Union. Poor Catholics then moved into the houses thus vacated, which were turned into tenements.
In 1813 the population of the parish was 1,993 males and 2,674 females, the majority of whom were Roman Catholics.
Restoration.
The architect Thomas Drew was the first to draw serious attention to the importance of the church, architecturally and historically, in 1866. He produced detailed plans of the church for which he won an award from the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, carried out excavations and drew up a paper on the church and its history. In a booklet published in 1873 the rector Alexander Leeper urged reroofing and restoration of the church.
In the 1980s an extensive restoration of the tower and bells was carried out. A few years later St. Anne's chapel, which had lost its roof and many monuments, was re-roofed and converted to a visitor reception centre, which included an exhibition on the history of the church. 
During conservation works starting in 1996 an extensive excavation of a small section of the church was carried out, which cast new light on the early days of the church. This contributed greatly to an understanding of the building history of the church. The detailed results of this study were published in book form in 2006.
Memorials.
In the main porch is stored an early Celtic gravestone known as the Lucky Stone which has been kept here or hereabouts since before 1309. It was said to have strange properties, and merchants and traders used to rub it for luck. It was first mentioned when Jon Le Decer, Mayor of Dublin, erected a marble cistern for water in Cornmarket in 1309 and placed this stone against it, so that all who drank of the waters may have luck. The stone was stolen on a number of occasions but always found its way back this neighbourhood. In 1826 it disappeared for twenty years, until found in front of the newly erected Catholic Church in High Street.
In the porch of the western door lie the fifteenth-century monuments of Sir Roland Fitz-Eustace, Lord Portlester, who died in 1496, and his wife, Margaret. Fitz-Eustace was Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, then Lord Chancellor of Ireland and finally Lord High Treasurer of Ireland. His refusal to surrender this last post led to a break with the king and almost to civil war. He was buried at Cotlandstown, County Kildare. Peter Talbot the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, who died in prison in 1680, is said to have been secretly entombed nearby.
Among those buried in the church are Sir Thomas Molyneux, his son Capel, and brother William Molyneux, Edward Parry, the Bishop of Killaloe and his sons John Parry and Benjamin Parry, successively Bishops of Ossory, and Lady Frances Brudenell.
During excavations in the 19th century an Anglo-Norman font, dating to the 12th century, was found and is now on display in the church.
Tower.
The church tower dates from the 17th century. The need to keep this structure in good repair was always a drain on parish funds. It was repaired in 1637, which was paid for by the Guild of St. Anne, but in 1669 part of it collapsed onto the roof of the church, and it had to be re-built. The Guild contributed £250 towards the cost of reconstruction. In 1826 the tower was remodelled by Henry Aaron Baker but by the end of the century was again in a dangerous state. Some remedial work was carried out in 1916 after an appeal from the Archbishop of Dublin, but it was not until the major restoration of 1982 that the tower was rendered safe. 
The tower houses six bells, three of which are Ireland's oldest bells, dating from 1423. The bells were rung for the Angelus and after the Reformation continued to be rung every morning and evening to call the people to and from their work. Due to the fragile state of the tower they were not pealed between 1898 and 1983. After the tower was strengthened the bells were retuned in 1983. One of them, the tenor, was recast in memory of Alexander E. Donovan (1908-1982), who was closely connected with the church. They are now pealed every week.
The present clock on the church tower came from St. Peter's Church in Aungier Street, after this church was demolished in the 1980s. The clock face dates from the 1820s.
Cemetery.
The old disused graveyard of St. Audoen's has been converted into a recreation ground. Many notables were buried there, including many Bishops and Lord Mayors of the city and the families of Ball, Bath, Blakeney, Browne, Cusack, Desminier, Fagan, Foster, Fyan, Gifford, Gilbert, Malone, Mapas, Molesworth, Penteny, Perceval, Quinn, Talbot and Ussher. The Curate-assistant Christopher Teeling McCready (died 1913) collected detailed genealogies of these families in seven hand-written volumes, which are now in Marsh's Library.
Historical events.
On 11 March 1597 a massive accidental gunpowder explosion in one of the nearby quays damaged the tower of St. Audoen's.
In the 1640s, at the time of the Catholic Confederate Rebellion, the burghers of the city could see from the church tower the fires of their opponents burning in the distance.
In 1733 a popular Alderman, Humphrey Frend, was returned at an election by a large majority, and two barrels of pitch were burned as celebration at the top of St. Audoen's tower.
The United Irishman Oliver Bond was elected Minister's Churchwarden of the church in 1787. Another United Irishman whose family had a long association with the church was James Napper Tandy, born at Cornmarket about 1740. He was a churchwarden of the church in 1765 and played a significant role in the life of the city before the Act of Union in 1801.
In 1793 a petition was sent from the vestry, requesting the removal of the police on the grounds of expense and inefficiency, and for the return of the night watchman originally appointed by the parish.

USS Walter A. Luckenbach (ID-3171)

USS "Walter A. Luckenbach" (ID-3171) was a United States Navy cargo ship and troop transport in commission from 1918 to 1919.
Construction and commissioning.
SS "Walter A. Luckenbach" was a steamer launched on 19 December 1917 by the Seattle Construction and Drydock Company, Seattle, Washington, for the Luckenbach Steamship Company. The United States Shipping Board took her over early in 1918. She was delivered to the U.S. Navy on 9 June 1918 for World War I service, assigned Identification Number (Id. No.) 3171, and commissioned as USS "Walter A. Luckenbach" that same day at Seattle with Lieutenant Commander James A. McDonald, USNRF, in command.
World War I service.
Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS), "Walter A. Luckenbach" sailed from Seattle on 13 June 1918, but an unsuccessful series of trials forced her to put into the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, for further work and repairs. Those modifications were completed on 18 August 1918, and she returned to sea.
"Walter A. Luckenbach" entered Mejillones, Chile, and loaded 10,000 tons of nitrates. She departed the Chilean port on 10 September 1918, transited the Panama Canal, and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 24 September 1918. After discharging her cargo and completing voyage repairs, she cleared Cape Henry and Cape Charles on 7 October 1918 and headed for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There, she loaded United States Army supplies bound for Europe and, on 29 October 1918, headed for France. After a stop at Gibraltar, "Walter A. Luckenbach" arrived in Marseilles on 14 November 1918, three days after the armistice ending World War I was signed, discharged her cargo, and loaded ballast for the return voyage. She stood out of Marseilles on 26 November 1918, stopped briefly at Gibraltar once again, and arrived at New York City on 11 December 1918.
On the day of her arrival, "Walter A. Luckenbach" was detached from the Naval Overseas Transportation Service and reassigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force. At New York, she was converted to a troop transport to help in the task of bringing home American troops from Europe. By 22 January 1919, she was ready to begin her role in that large movement of people. Between late January and early July 1919, "Walter A. Luckenbach" made five round-trip voyages to France, two to Bordeaux and three to St. Nazaire. She returned to New York from her final voyage on 11 July 1919.
"Walter A. Luckenbach" was decommissioned at Hoboken, New Jersey, on 28 July 1919, and was returned to the Luckenbach Steamship Company that same day. Once again SS "Walter A. Luckenbach", she entered mercantile service with that company.
Post-World War I commercial career.
"Walter A. Luckenbach" labored in behalf of Luckenbach Steamship Company until 1950, when she changed hands and names twice. First, she was sold to the New Orleans Coal and Bisso Towboat Company, Inc., and briefly served that company as SS "A. L. Bisso". Later in the year, the Turkish firm Marsa Ithalat-Ithracat, T.A.S., bought her and renamed her SS "Mardin". She served that firm and under that name for the remainder of her mercantile career.
"Mardin" arrived at Bremen, West Germany, early in 1957 to load cargo, but was not allowed to leave port because of unpaid repair bills. After a lengthy period in custody, she attempted to escape on a stormy, dark night later that year, slipping away from her moorings unannounced, showing no lights, using no tugboat assistance, and with no harbor pilot aboard. She proceeded at full speed down the Weser River, trying to reach international waters in the North Sea before West German authorities could stop her. The harbor police did not realize that she was attempting to escape until she was off Bremerhaven and approaching the open sea, so they used an ex-German Navy patrol boat at Bremerhaven to pursue her. They caught her just before she got beyond the three-nautical-mile (5.6 km) limit of West German territorial waters, boarded her while she was still underway, arrested her master on her bridge, and forced her to return to Bremen. She was once again placed in custody.
Records of "Mardin"s status after the 1957 incident are unclear as to her fate, but she does not appear ever to have resumed commercial operations. She is believed to have been scrapped in 1958 or 1959.
