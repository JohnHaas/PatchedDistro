The Lucky One (novel)

The Lucky One is a 2008 romance novel by American writer Nicholas Sparks. The novel was adapted into a 2012 film starring Zac Efron and Taylor Schilling.
Themes.
The novel deals with the themes of starcrossed fate and destiny. Despite the allusions to such themes made in the novel, Sparks admitted that he does not necessarily believe in either. He adds, however, that he is "a big believer in the fact that people have the ability to influence the future in a way that seems coincidental and when that happens, the feeling of fate or destiny is amplified. [...] In the end, when writing "The Lucky One", I wanted to explore the subject of fate or destiny, but in a way that reflected the reality of the world."
Plot.
U.S. Marine Logan Thibault finds a photograph of a smiling young woman half-buried in the dirt during his first deployment in the Iraq War. He carries the photo in his pocket and soon wins a streak of poker games, then survives a battle that kills two of his closest buddies. His best friend, Victor, seems to have an explanation for his good fortune: the photograph, his lucky charm.
Back home in Colorado, Thibault begins to believe that the woman in the photo somehow holds the key to his destiny. He sets out on a journey across the country with his German shepherd Zeus to find her and eventually encounters Elizabeth "Beth" Green, a divorced mother with a young son Ben, in North Carolina. 
Caught off guard by the attraction he feels, Thibault keeps the story of the photo and his luck a secret. He and Beth begin a passionate love affair, but the secret of the photo will soon threaten to tear them apart—destroying not only their deep and true passionate, romantic love but also their very lives.

Daunia

The Daunia is a historical and geographical region in Apulia, southern Italy, mostly coincident with modern Province of Foggia. Its inhabitants were called the Daunians by the ancient Greeks and were also known as the Daunii and the Apulians to the ancient Romans. In ancient times, together with Peucetia and Messapia it formed the Iapygia.
Origins.
Towards the late Bronze Age (11th-10th centuries BC), Illyrian populations from the eastern Adriatic arrived in Apulia. The Illyrians in Italy, united with the pre-existing people and groups from the Aegean, probably from Crete, created the Iapygian civilization which consisted of three tribes: Peucetia, Messapi and the Dauni. 
The Dauni were similar to but also different from the Peucetii and Messapii, who settled in central and southern Puglia. Having been also less influenced by the Campanian civilization, it had thus a more peculiar culture, featuring in particular the Daunian steles, a series of funerary monuments sculpted in the 7th-6th centuries BC in the plain south of Siponto, and now housed in the National Museum of that city. Particularly striking is Daunian pottery (as yet little studied) which begins with geometric patterning but which eventually includes crude human, bird and plant figures.
The main Daunian centers were "Teanum Apulum" (within the modern San Paolo di Civitate), 
Uria Garganica, the location of which though is not known with certainty, Casone, Lucera, "Merinum" (Vieste), Monte Saraceno (near Mattinata), Siponto, Coppa Navigata, Cupola, Salapia (near Cerignola and Manfredonia), Arpi (near Foggia), "Aecae" (near Troia), "Vibinum "(Bovino), Castelluccio dei Sauri, "Herdonia" (Ordona), "Ausculum "(Ascoli Satriano), Ripalta (near Cerignola), Canosa di Puglia, Melfi, Lavello and Venosa.
Another
Etymology.
The ethnonym is connected to the name of the wolf, plausibly the totemic animal of this nation. The cult of the wolf was widespread in ancient Italy and was related to the Arcadian mystery cult. In fact "daunos" means wolf, according to ancient glosses, and is the correspondent of Greek "taunos" from a Indoeuropean root *dhau- to strangle, meaning literally "strangler". Among the Daunians towns one may mention Lucera (Leucaria) and among other nations the ethnonym of the Lucani (Loucanoi) and of that the Hirpini, from another word meaning wolf. The outcome of the Indoeuropean voiced aspirate "dh" is proper of the Illyrian languages and thus different from the corresponding Latin "Faunus" and Oscan which is not attested. 
Presence in ancient Italy.
There are numerous testimonies among ancient authors (Pseudo-Scylax, Vergil, Festus, Servius) of a presence of the Daunians beyond the Apennines in Campania and Latium where some towns claimed Diomedian origins. The most notable instance is Ardea, the centre of the Rutulians who were considered Daunians: Vergil writes that Turnus' father was Daunus. Festus wries that a king Lucerus of Ardea fought along with Romulus against Tatius and this is the origin of the name of the Roman Luceres.

John Hatley

Captain John Hatley, RN (c. 1762 – 12 December 1832) was an officer of the British Royal Navy during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Hatley is most noted for being one of the junior officers on board Captain James Cook's third voyage in , aged approximately 14. He later went on to serve in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, receiving promotion after helping to thwart a mutiny in 1797 and later commanding frigates in several campaigns.
Military service.
Hatley, born in approximately 1762, joined the Royal Navy at a young age and in his first posting was attached to Captain James Cook's ship . This vessel had secretly been ordered to search what is now the Alaskan Coast for the Northwest Passage. Leaving Britain in 1776, the ship reached Tahiti the following year and returned Omai, Captain Cook's translator and guide, to his home. From there, the vessel sailed north and visited the Hawaiian Islands, the Sandwich Islands and was the first European ship to visit and chart the coastline from California to Alaska. During 1778, Cook's behaviour became gradually more unpredictable, until in 1779 he returned to Hawaii to effect repairs on his ship prior to returning to Europe. There he was killed by Hawaiian warriors during a dispute over stolen goods. The survivors of the expedition finally returned to Britain in 1780.
In 1782, in recognition of his service on the exploratory voyage, Hatley was promoted to lieutenant and ordered to join for service in the East Indies. He remained a lieutenant, serving in various ships, until 1797 when he was embroiled in a mutiny aboard . The problems arose against the backdrop of the Spithead Mutiny in Britain, when malcontents in the Mediterranean Fleet, at this time stationed off Cadiz, were seized at the orders of Earl St Vincent. These men were sentenced to death by court martial on Saturday and due to be executed on the Sunday morning. "St George" was chosen as the vessel on which the sentences would be carried out. The crew were strongly opposed to carrying out these executions on a Sunday and brought a petition to Captain Shuldham Peard, who passed it on to St Vincent. The admiral's reply was that the sentences were justified and must be carried out with alacrity. Infuriated, sections of the crew prepared to seize the ship and gathered on deck, where they were met by Peard and Hatley, the ship's second in command. Addressing his men, Peard attempted to calm them but without effect. Seeking to prevent a mutiny and ensuing massacre, Peard and Hatley then charged the mass of sailors and seized two ringleaders. The next day the scheduled executions were carried out and a week later the two men captured by Peard and Hatley were similarly hanged. For his services on this occasion, Hatley was promoted to commander.
In the Napoleonic Wars, Hatley commanded the frigate in the West Indies and later in the Mediterranean where he was awarded a gold medal for services to the Ottoman Empire. At the funeral of Horatio Nelson, Hatley formed part of the procession that accompanied the coffin to St. Paul's Cathedral. In 1808, Hatley commanded the frigate during the campaign in the Indian Ocean and participated in the Raid on Saint Paul. The following winter he switched with Commodore Josias Rowley and took command of the ship of the line which was returning to Britain for a refit. He retired at the end of the Napoleonic Wars and died in Dover, Kent on 12 December 1832 and was remembered as the last survivor of Captain Cook's voyages.

John Solomon (rugby union)

John Solomon (born 15 October 1929) was an Australian rugby union player, a state and national representative versatile back who captained the Wallabies in eight Tests in the 1950s and the led touring squads to New Zealand and South Africa.
__TOC__
Early life & University.
Educated at Coogee Prep School and then The Scots College in Sydney, Solomon started his club rugby at the University rugby club when he commenced his medical studies at St Andrew's College at Sydney University in 1948. He won University "blues" in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951.
Australian representative.
He made his state and national representative debuts at age nineteen, first playing for Australia against the at the Sydney Cricket Ground in June 1949. Later that year he toured New Zealand with Trevor Allan's Bledisloe Cup winning Wallabies. Solomon played variously at five-eighth, fullback and centre in seven matches of the tour including the 2nd Test at Eden Park where he scored a try thus helping the side make history as the first Australian team to win the Cup in New Zealand.
He played twice for New South Wales in 1950 at against the visiting British and Irish Lions and as five-eighth for Australia in both Tests of the tour. He was in the centres in the second Waratahs match against the Lions who up till that point of their tour were undefeated. Solomon held his own against the world-class opposition of Bleddyn Williams and Lewis Jones.
In 1951 Solomon played against the visiting All Blacks in two Tests and with the Waratahs. The selectors experimented with Keith Winning and Colin Windon as captain and then in 1952 when Australia hosted the exciting Fijians, Solomon was honoured with the national captaincy aged just twenty-two. Fiji had not previously played against Australia and had only competed at the world-class level against New Zealand in 1939. Solomon made an outstanding debut as captain on this historic occasion. He played at inside-centre and clinched the first Test for Australia when he dived over for a try six minutes from the end. The Fijians won the 2nd Test but in the process earned the respect of the Australian rugby public who delighted in the spectacular running and carefree play of the Fijians who would wrestle the ball at every opportunity and who employed long, one-handed and sometimes reckless passing.
Australia then undertook a ten matches tour of New Zealand for which Solomon was chosen as captain with tour manager the 1927 Waratah, Jock Blackwood. Solomon's Wallabies won eight of the ten games including one Test victory and one Test loss. Solomon scored three tries in the nine matches in which he played, captaining his country in all.
Following the South African tour, Solomon took a year out to attend to his medical studies but returned in 1955 to captain the Wallabies to New Zealand with Wylie Breckenbridge as manager and Bill Cerutti as assistant manager/coach. Solomon only played in six of the thirteen games suffering a dislocated shoulder against a Canterbury/Otago side which marked the end of his representative career. He later coached at the University club as well as the Australian national side.
Accolades and honours.
His 1953 South African tour teammate Sir Nicholas Shehadie described him as follows: "Quick enough to play centre or wing, equipped with a skilful swerve and sharp acceleration when a gap appeared. Much admired for his astute captaincy".

Programmes.
The programmes have been given the highest status, both nationally and internationally. This means that they measure up to the best comparable courses on offer abroad. The programmes aim to train students for careers as professional musicians, and, depending on the course taken, students graduate either as solo performers or as music teachers.
The emphasis of the teaching is on solo work with an instrument or the voice, but there is also ensemble playing and a number of supplementary subjects. For those studying to become music teachers, particular importance is attached to music pedagogy and communicative subjects.
Since 2008 Det Jyske Musikkonservatorium has made a name for itself as having (along with King's College London) rejected the Danish musician Goodiepal's ideas about Radical Computer Music. In a direct response, Goodiepal declared a five step "Gentleman's War" on "the stupidity of modern computer music and media based art" specially aimed at Det Jyske Musikkonservatorium. In 2009 the school finally started to give in and on the 15th of September 2009, Goodiepal was awarded a medal by Professor Wayne Siegel, leader of DIEM, the electronic music department of Det Jyske Musikkonservatorium, acknowledging his hard work and struggles to change the mindset of the old-fashioned academy.

Originally built in 1964, Birchmount Park has recently undergone a revitalization program as the Library and the Technical shops have been refurbished and modernized. At the same time, the school expanded its computer and display capabilities to increase the ease with which computer technology is integrated into all programs. The combined effect is to enhance literacy development within the school and increase differentiated learning opportunities for students.
Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute's Adult Re-Entry program for the Scarborough Board of Education was established in November 1977 with one teacher and fifteen students that evolved into Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies in September 1986 opened at Tabor Park Vocational School on Midland Avenue.
The school became a movie feature of the 1986 film "Youngblood" and the 2003 film, "How to Deal".
Overview.
Athletics.
The school is renowned in Scarborough for BEAP (Birchmount Exceptional Athlete Program) which began in September 1989 and continues to draw superior athletes to the school.
In the mid eighties the school was a leader in athletics. However, in the 1990s teams and individuals dropped off and performed adequately as the BEAP program began to "find itself". By 2002 the school was once again atop the leader boards in athletics. With the BEAP, Variety Village, Birchmount Stadium, and Phoenix Athletic Association at its disposal, they have once again returned to a powerhouse in Track & Field since 2005.

Kelly Keen coyote attack

The Kelly Keen coyote attack is one of two known coyote attacks to prove fatal, and the only recorded fatal coyote attack in the United States. Three-year-old Kelly Lynn Keen was dragged off her property and fatally wounded before being rescued by her father. The event is also notable for its aftermath, in which large numbers of coyotes were killed and two animal rights activists provoked an uproar by claiming that her parents, not the coyote, had killed her.
The attack.
In August, 1981, three-year old girl Kelly Keen was left by her mother, Cathy, to watch cartoons in the living room of the family's home in the Chevy Chase Canyon neighborhood of Glendale, California. Kelly left through the front door and stepped into the driveway where she encountered a coyote. The coyote took the child in its mouth and ran off, dragging her through the street. Kelly's father, Robert, came running quickly, chased the coyote off, and rushed Kelly to the Glendale Adventist Hospital, where she was in surgery for four hours before she died. The cause of death was a broken neck and blood loss as a direct result of the coyote attack.
The aftermath.
Government reaction.
Following Keen's death, the Glendale Commissioner’s personnel developed the first serious urban coyote management program, including 80 days of leghold trapping and shooting within a 0.5-mile (0.8-km) radius of the attack site, during which county personnel trapped and shot 55 coyotes.
Accusations by animal rights activists.
In 2004, animal rights activist and former child star Pamelyn Ferdin attended a Glendale City Council meeting to oppose a proposal to cull urban coyotes. Ferdin addressed the Council wearing a shirt covered in fake blood, urging the city not to cull coyotes. She mentioned the Kelly Keen attack, and argued that rather than having been killed by a coyote, Keen had been the victim of child abuse. She claimed that medical records indicated that the child died of a ruptured spleen, which could only have come from blunt trauma, not an animal bite. Fellow animal rights activist Michael Bell went further, claiming that, after digging around in hospital records, he discovered discrepancies and missing documents. He stated that the coyote story was a cover-up for how the child really died. Kelly's parents, Robert and Cathy Keen, watched the meeting live on cable and, upon hearing Bell's statement, raced to the Glendale City hall to respond to the allegations. They recounted the event to the council, and showed the death certificate, which listed the cause of the child’s injuries as "mauled by a coyote".
Ferdin's stance remained unchanged; ""I stand by my beliefs that a coyote did not kill (Kelly Keen)."" Councilman Frank Quintero stated: ""What the activists said at the dais was cruel and absolutely uninformed ... Knowing the mother, it broke my heart that they would do that to her. When they were making the accusations, I was considering stopping them.""
Fatal coyote attacks on humans.
The Kelly Keen attack is the only proven fatal coyote attack in the United States and one of only two such fatal attacks anywhere. The other, the Taylor Mitchell coyote attack, occurred in Canada. On October 28, 2009, Mitchell, a famous 19-year-old Canadian folk singer who, during a tour break, was killed by at least three Eastern coyotes while she was hiking alone on a hiking trail in the Cape Breton Highlands, Nova Scotia.
Similar attacks.
USDA and California State University researchers have confirmed at least thirty-five incidents in the state in which “the possibility of serious or fatal injury seems likely if the child had not been rescued” from coyotes, including the following sample of confirmed coyote attacks on children in California:

<doc id="19903076" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19903076" title="Hand-Over">
Hand-Over

A Hand-Over is a term used in the animation industry to refer to the process of adding finger and hand motion capture data to the pre-existing full-body motion capture data, using a hand motion capture device.
Techniques.
A Hand-Over is accomplished by playing back the full-body data while recording the finger and hand data. This is similar to a voice actor doing a voice-over for animated characters.
There are very few full-body motion capture systems that can capture full hand and finger motion data at the same time as the full body. An optical system gets accurate data using reflective markers and high resolution cameras. However, if the cameras cannot see the markers then they are unable to measure them. Mounting the many reflective markers on each individual joint of the hand so that they stay within the camera's views is difficult.
The traditional method of adding hand and finger motion is to key frame the fingers. This is a process similar to the old claymation process; move the finger, record the frame, move the finger again, record the frame. Key framing is easier using animation software where a beginning and an ending position can be set up, then the software fills in the motion in between. Even though software makes this easy it still takes a very talented artist to get realistic hands using the key frame method.
Another method of adding hand and finger motion is to have the animator or actor wear a data glove or wired glove. These devices very accurately measure and record the position and bend of each finger, thumb, and even the hand. Measurand's "ShapeHand" is made of flexible ribbons and includes 40 Fiber Optic bend/twist sensors.
Using a hand motion capture device an animator can play back the full-body data from any system and record the hand motion. This is typically done in a software package that can simultaneously play motion capture data while recording new motion capture data. This requires some practice to get the timing right just as it takes practice to get the timing right when a voice actor does an animation voice-over.
Hand-overs can save time and money while increasing the realism in hand and finger animation. This is not done without controversy. Traditional key framers do not agree this type of motion capture is better than their craft.

Poetry Translation Centre

The Poetry Translation Centre is an organization dedicated to translating poetry from Africa, Asia and Latin America. It was founded by the British poet Sarah Maguire in 2004. Its work has been championed by such British poets as Nick Laird, and it is one of the Arts Council England's regularly funded organisations.
The PTC's website currently includes translations of 159 poems by 44 poets from 21 countries written in 19 different languages – from Amharic to Zapotec. The poems are given in three different versions: in the original language, as a basic 'literal' translation and as the final version in English, thus giving a valuable insight into the translation process. The site also features recordings of poems read in English, Arabic, Kurdish, Portuguese, Somali, Tajik and Urdu, together with videos of readings.
The PTC has organised two World Poets' Tours. The first, in 2005, introduced Partaw Naderi (Afghanistan), Gagan Gill (India), Toeti Heraty (Indonesia), Coral Bracho (Mexico), Maxamed Xaashi Dhamac 'Gaariye' (Somaliland) and Al-Saddiq Al-Raddi (Sudan) to UK audiences. In 2008, Corsino Fortes (Cape Verde), Maxamed Xaashi Dhamac 'Gaariye', Al-Saddiq Al-Raddi and Farzaneh Khojandi (Tajikistan) took part in the Centre's second World Poets' Tour, which also featured the poetry of Kajal Ahmad (Kurdistan) and Noshi Gillani (Pakistan), who were unable to travel to the UK.
A registered charity, the Poetry Translation Centre's trustees are Lord Victor Adebowale, CBE, Fiona Sampson, the current editor of "Poetry Review", and Gary McKeone, Chair of the Poetry Archive.
British poets who have contributed translations have included Carole Satyamurti, Choman Hardi, David Harsent, Jane Duran, Jo Shapcott, Katherine Pierpoint, Lavinia Greenlaw, Mark Ford, Mimi Khalvati, Sarah Maguire, Sean O'Brien and W N Herbert.

John Walsingham

John Walsingham (born 1961) is a British painter, an influential representative of drip painting and founder of Personal Expressionism. 
Little is known of Walsingham’s biography as a painter other than that he obtained and developed his artistic influence in the USA, particularly in New York. He grew up in Germany and moved to England, but belongs to the American Action Art movement. His artistic work has developed in the 1990s and is found mainly in major European private collections. Since 1998 the art collection is limited to about 30 completed pieces. Walsingham now lives in a mansion in the South of England.
Work.
Walsingham’s early works are still influenced by the European trends of Surrealism and Naivety, only later he turns to subjective Expressionism. The experience of Jackson Pollock had inspired his own style as he overcame the negation of the artist, as in the case with Pollock’s work. With Walsingham the process of painting comes into a new balance to the subjectivity of expression. The personality of the painter returns through structurality that had completely dissolved in Pollock. It is Walsingham’s merit to have stopped the total vagueness of Abstract Expressionism and the dissolution of the personal statement by the re-introduction of structures. In Pollock’s work the basic subject of the relationship between body and soul searches for forms, Walsingham finds metaphors that have as its theme a mental interrelated activity.
The development from Abstract Expressionism to Personal Expressionismn.
The question of subjectivity that Pollock denied and that excluded the artist from the work of art was put by Walsingham into a new form. It turns into the question of personality which he gives an affirmative answer and which takes the beholder into the picture. The overcoming of the dissolution of forms of Expressionism, that does not fall back on subjectivity, but puts the personality (of the artist or the beholder) into the centre of the discourse, is the brilliant, trendsetting performance of Walsingham. With his reference to Personal Expressionism he anticipated artistically the catastrophe of 9/11 already in 1991 (Burning Manhattan), which highlights the central cultural problem of the present (the new religiousness of the 21st century, fundamentalism, terrorism with religious motives).

Closed geodesic

In differential geometry and dynamical systems, a closed geodesic on a Riemannian manifold is the projection of a closed orbit of the geodesic flow on the manifold.
Definition.
In a Riemannian manifold ("M","g"), a closed geodesic is a curve formula_1 that is a geodesic for the metric "g" and is periodic.
Closed geodesics can be characterized by means of a variational principle. Denoting by formula_2 the space of smooth 1-periodic curves on "M", closed geodesics of period 1 are precisely the critical points of the energy function formula_3, defined by
formula_4
If formula_5 is a closed geodesic of period "p", the reparametrized curve formula_6 is a closed geodesic of period 1, and therefore it is a critical point of "E". If formula_5 is a critical point of "E", so are the reparametrized curves formula_8, for each formula_9, defined by formula_10. Thus every closed geodesic on "M" gives rise to an infinite sequence of critical points of the energy "E".
Examples.
On the unit sphere formula_11 with the standard round Riemannian metric, every great circle is an example of a closed geodesic. Manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed have been thoroughly investigated in the mathematical literature. On a compact hyperbolic surface, whose fundamental group has no torsion, closed geodesics are in one-to-one correspondence with non-trivial conjugacy classes of elements in the Fuchsian group of the surface.

Fool (novel)

Fool is the eleventh novel by Christopher Moore, released on February 10, 2009.
The novel takes its premise from the plot of Shakespeare's play "King Lear", narrated from the perspective of the character of the Fool, whose name is Pocket.
In the course of the novel are references to other Shakespeare plays, ranging from short quotations to whole characters—most notably the three witches from "Macbeth." While the style of "Fool" is directed at an American audience, the author incorporates at times Shakespearean vocabulary, archaic syntax, and modern British slang, and obscure cultural terms relating to medieval life, which are explained in footnotes. In addition, Moore invents humorous British-style place-names for fictitious locations in the story.
Plot.
Pocket is the royal fool at the court of King Lear of Britain. To prevent Lear from marrying off his daughter Cordelia, a girl Pocket is especially fond of, he schemes with Edmund of Gloucester. Pocket advises the bastard (i.e., illegitimate) Edmund how to take the land of his legitimate brother Edgar, while Edmund is to prevent the marriage of Cordelia. Edmund somehow gets Lear to ask each of his three daughters – Goneril, Regan and Cordelia – how much they love him. While Goneril and Regan please the old king with their exaggerations, Cordelia enraged him with her famous laconic “I love thee, according to my bond.” Lear disinherits Cordelia and divides his kingdom between Goneril and Regan. Notwithstanding, the prince of France marries Cordelia and takes her with him. 
Deprived of his adored Cordelia and angry with Lear because of the way Cordelia was treated, Pocket – advised by the ghost of a woman who turns out was not only his deceased lover but also the former queen of Lear and mother of Cordelia – starts his own vendetta: He encourages Goneril and Regan to strip Lear of his remaining power (especially his train of 100 knights, one of the conditions on which Lear passed the kingdom to his daughters) and works to drive the older sisters into war against each other. Lear finally realizes his error and goes temporarily mad. To estrange the sisters he makes both believe that they are in an affair with Edmund of Gloucester. While successful in this, Pocket fails to incite civil war, simply because Cordelia – now a veritable warrior queen – invades Britain with her army from France. Lear, and later on Pocket, end up in the dungeon of the castle now ruled by Edmund, now Earl of Gloucester.
The two elder sisters are in the same castle and ally against Cordelia, but poison each other out of jealousy nonetheless. Edmund confronts Lear and Pocket, and Pocket kills him with his throwing knives. Shortly after, Lear dies. Cordelia invades the castle and becomes queen of Britain. Pocket, who has been told by witches that he is the son of Lear’s brother, marries Cordelia and is made king.
Popularity.
The novel debuted in fourth place on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover fiction, according to the online issue for February 20, 2009.

Two Occasions

"Two Occasions" is a R&B song written by Babyface, Darnell Bristol and Sid Johnson (who was the former manager for Babyface's early group, Manchild) [http://www.soultracks.com/the_deele.htm]. It was produced by Babyface and L.A. Reid for The Deele's third studio album "Eyes of a Stranger" (1987). The ballad was released as the album's second single in 1988. It's the only song on the album that features Babyface on lead vocals, which alternate between himself, Bristol, and Carlos "Satin" Greene throughout the course of the song. It has since been remade into a live version with added vocals from Babyface with all original vocals from The Deele intact; this version appeared on the 12" maxi single and also three years later on his album, "A Closer Look".
The song and Babyface were later referenced by Mariah Carey in her 2005 hit song, "We Belong Together."
The song is also sampled in the 2009 hit song Want It, Need It by Plies Featuring Ashanti. It was also sampled in the song "I Still Love You" by Next (group) on their Rated Next album. Rap/Hip Hop artist Charlie Manhattan, released his version of "Two Occasions," in 2007, which was taken from his solo debut album, 'The Manhattan Project'.
Reception
Craig Lytle, in his review of the album for Allmusic, called "Two Occasions" a "quiet-storm classic" with "superb arrangement and production", declaring the song "worthy of a number-one ranking." In 1989, the song won a BMI Pop Award.
Although the band's first hit "Body Talk" actually had a higher placement on the R&B chart, "Two Occasions" is widely considered The Deele's most successful single. It peaked at ten on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, four on the Hot R&B and twenty-one on the Adult Contemporary chart.

Mori-Torbole tunnel

The Mori-Torbole Tunnel (Italian: "Galleria Adige-Garda") is a diversion tunnel completed in 1959 between the Italian towns of Mori and Nago-Torbole to connect the Adige river with Lake Garda.
Its function is to reduce water levels in the river upstream of the province of Verona by discharging excess water into the lake. The tunnel reduces the risk of flooding in Verona and environs from once every seventy years to once every two centuries. 
To increase the level of Lake Garda by 1 cm, the tunnel must divert about 3,700,000 m³ of water.
When the tunnel is open, the lake's turbidity increases. The sudden influx of the Adige's water, which is both appreciably colder and more polluted than the lake's, causes a considerable heat shock and significantly worsens the habitat for fish.
For these reasons the tunnel is used only on the rare occasion when there is a flood risk in the Veronese basin.
History.
After the great floods of the second part of the 19th century (the last in 1882), defense of the city of Verona from Adige floods was deemed urgent. Using an idea already established in the 18th century, Venice's Water Magistrate proposed constructing a diversion tunnel to Lake Garda that would alleviate flooding by conveying that part of the Adige's flow exceeding the river's carrying capacity. The lake's surface area, equal to about 370 km², would allow the diversion of huge volumes of river water with only a modest increase in the lake's level. The most appropriate solution was considered to be a tunnel originating on the right bank of the Adige near Ravazzone (a subdivision of Mori) and terminating at Lake Garda to the south of Torbole. The depth of the lake at that location would allow solid material that might be transported by the water to be deposited without damage. Construction began under the fascist government in March 1939, was suspended for the war in 1943, then resumed in 1954 to finish in May 1959.
The construction of the tunnel caused the death of Lake Loppio, due to the diversion of the springs that fed it.
Features.
The electromechanical equipment that supports the Adige-Garda Tunnel consists of grilles, watertight doors and gates with associated control panels, and controls housed in special rooms. The gates are positioned on four intake windows. Each gate has a width of 9.50 m and is made up of two overlapping panels. The lower of the two panels is 3 m high and the upper one 5 m high.

U.S. Route 4 in New Hampshire

In the state of New Hampshire, U.S. Route 4 runs for across the central and southern part of the state, stretching from Lebanon on the Connecticut River border with Vermont southeast to Portsmouth on the eastern coast.
Route description.
U.S. Route 4 crosses the Connecticut River into New Hampshire in the community of West Lebanon, where it immediately intersects Route 10 which runs parallel to the river. US-4 turns south onto Route 10, and the two routes turn south, meeting Route 12A before turning towards and interchanging with Interstate 89. At this point, Route 10 joins the I-89 freeway southbound, while US-4 continues east into downtown Lebanon. The road crosses Route 120, continues east and interchanges with I-89/Route 10 again. US-4 continues east away from the freeway into Mascoma, where Route 4A splits off to the southeast. US-4 continues east through Enfield and into Canaan, where it meets the southern end of Route 118. The road turns to the south at this point, passing through Grafton and Danbury, where US-4 meets the west end of Route 104 and continues south into Andover. In Andover, US-4 turns back to the east and meets Route 11 near Route 4A's eastern terminus. US-4 and Route 11 run concurrently through Andover for about before splitting, Route 11 to the northeast and US-4 to the southeast. US-4 enters the town of Salisbury and crosses Route 127, before continuing into Boscawen and intersecting with U.S. Route 3. US-3 and US-4 share a short concurrency (about a mile), before US-4 turns east to interchange with Interstate 93 at Exit 17.
US-4 joins I-93 southbound, and runs along the freeway until Exit 15E in Concord. At this interchange, US-4 leaves I-93 and joins Interstate 393 and U.S. Route 202 which run eastbound out of the city. The two U.S. routes overlap I-393 to its terminus in the northern corner of Pembroke. I-393 then ends, and US-4/US-202 merge onto Route 9 eastbound through Chichester and into Epsom. The road crosses Route 28 at the Epsom Traffic Circle, then continues east and intersects Route 107, forming a long four-route concurrency into Northwood, where Route 107 splits off to the northwest. US-4, US-202, and Route 9 continue through Northwood, and US-202 and Route 9 split from US-4 at an intersection with Route 43.
US-4 continues east, meeting the west end of New Hampshire Route 152 and proceeding into Nottingham and then into Lee, where US-4 meets Route 125 at a rotary interchange. After leaving this interchange, US-4 crosses into Durham and becomes a semi-limited-access highway. US-4 has a partial eastbound interchange with Route 155 and a diamond interchange with Route 155A down the road, providing access to the University of New Hampshire campus in Durham. US-4 has one more interchange, with Route 108, before becoming a full-access highway again. US-4 continues east towards the coast and crosses the tidal Bellamy River to enter Dover, then interchanges with the Spaulding Turnpike (Route 16). US-4 joins the Turnpike southbound, closely paralleling the Maine state border and crossing the Little Bay Bridge into the town of Newington before continuing into the city of Portsmouth. US-4 comes to an end at the final southbound interchange with Interstate 95, where the Turnpike splits to merge with I-95 South, and Route 16 continues south to end at the Portsmouth Traffic Circle, providing access to I-95 North and U.S. Route 1 Bypass.
History.
The section of US 4 from the Vermont state line to Andover (and NH 11 from Andover to Franklin) was first numbered in 1925 as an eastern extension of New England Route 14. From Franklin to Concord, New Hampshire the road was designated as Route 6 (now US 3), and from Concord to Northwood, New Hampshire it was Route 9 (now NH-9). Between Northwood and Dover, New Hampshire, the road was previously not numbered. From Dover to its eastern terminus at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the road used part of Route 16 (now New Hampshire Route 16).
Junction list.
Exit numbers listed are those of the primary highway with which US 4 is concurrent.
Suffixed routes.
New Hampshire Route 4A is a long route between Lebanon and Andover, New Hampshire, serving as a shortcut around several villages on U.S. Route 4. Until Interstate 89 was built in the early 1970s, this was part of the main route between the Lebanon-Hanover area and the southeastern portion of New Hampshire. Today, traffic is very light on this road.
NH 4A is signed as a north-south highway, although its orientation is more southeast-northwest. The northern terminus is in Lebanon at US 4, near the western tip of Lake Mascoma. The southern terminus is in the town of Andover at New Hampshire Route 11, about 3/4 mile southwest of its intersection with US 4. This highway is locally named the 4th New Hampshire Turnpike.
Route 4A is an alternate route of U.S. Route 4, and not of New Hampshire Route 4, a completely different route located in Dover.

Vagonul Arad

Vagonul Arad was a football club based in Arad, Arad County in western Romania. It was founded in 1911 and it soon became one of the best teams from Arad. It was affiliated to "Astra" rail equipment manufacturing company. It was dissolved in 2006.
History.
1911 - 1948.
The club was formed in Arad in 1911 when "AMEF" "(Asociația Muncitorilor pentru Educație Fizică)" (Workers Association for Physical Education) merged with "Clubul Sportiv Al Fabricii De Vagoane" (Rail Cars Factory Sports Club), keeping the first ones name until 1948.
After World War I it qualified for the national championship 3 times, but never being able to pass the semi-finals.
During 1932-1940 we see the club playing in Liga I, their best performance - 2nd place at the end of the 1935-36 season.
In 1940 AMEF is dissolved by the legionar regime, but after World War II, we see it for a couple of years in Liga II (1946–1948).
1948 - 1962.
In 1948 it merges with "Astra Arad", the new club being named "UVA-AMEFA", and plays for one season in Liga III, after which until 1955 it plays in the regional championship. Being renamed "Metalul", plays for one year in Liga II (1955–1956) and for one year in Liga III (1956–1957). With a new name "Energia", plays for one year in Liga II (1957–1958). In 1958 the club comes back to its traditional name "AMEF Arad", and plays in the Liga II until 1962.
1962 - 1989.
Once again the club is renamed, this time to "Vagonul", after its main sponsor "Întreprinderea de Vagoane Arad" (Arad Rail Cars Enterprise). Under this name it plays in Liga II in the 1962-1963 season, in Liga III in the 1963-1964 season, and again in Liga II until 1968, at the end of which, the club succeeds to promote to Liga I. In the same year, the team reaches the semi-finals of the Romanian Cup. After only one season of top class football, the team relegates to Liga II and from now forward we see it going only down. 1969-1971 Liga II, after this Liga III, where they were close to the regional championship, but in 1973 a merger with "CFR Arad" saved them. The new team was given the name "Unirea", and plays in Liga II until 1977, in 1974 changing its name again, this time to "Rapid Arad". The 1977-1980 period sees the club in Liga III, 1980-1984 in Liga II, 1984-1989 Liga III. In 1985 - "CSM Rapid", 1986 - "Vagonul", 1987 - "CSM Vagonul".
1989 - 2006.
The club succeeds to promote to Liga II once again in 1989, from 1991 with the name of "Astra". The spell lasts only until 1992, and the club sees itself in Liga III once again. The name changes again: "FC Arad" in 1994, "Telecom Arad" in 1996, and "Romtelecom" in 2005.
At the end of the Liga III 2005-06 season, the club finished 13th and relegated to the Arad county championship (Fourth League), and with this we see the disappearance of a yet another old Romanian football club.

Vietnamese people in Germany

Vietnamese people in Germany form the country's largest group of resident foreigners from Asia, with Federal Statistical Office figures showing 83,446 Vietnamese nationals residing in Germany at the end of 2005. Not included in those figures are individuals of Vietnamese origin or descent who have naturalised as German citizens. Between 1981 and 2007, 41,499 people renounced Vietnamese citizenship to take up German nationality. A further 40,000 irregular migrants of Vietnamese origin were estimated to live in Germany, largely concentrated in the Eastern states, .
Migration history.
West Germany.
The Vietnamese community in West Germany consists of refugees from the Vietnam War. The first of the boat people who fled the country after the fall of Saigon, consisting of 208 families totalling 640 individuals who had fled on board the "Hai Hong", arrived in Hanover on 3 December 1978 by plane. None spoke German. Several factors aided their social and economic integration into German society. They received official aid in the form of social benefits and job placement assistance, as well as broader societal support for their successful adaptation to German life. Further, unlike other migrant groups, they knew that they had no option to return to their country of origin if they failed in their adopted land. They spread out through a variety of economic sectors, but were somewhat concentrated in the metal industry. By the eve of German reunification, West Germany had roughly 33,000 Vietnamese immigrants, largely consisting of boat people and their relatives who were admitted under family reunification schemes.
East Germany.
East Germany began to invite North Vietnamese students to attend study and training programmes there as early as the 1950s; cooperation expanded in 1973, when they pledged to train a further 10,000 Vietnamese citizens in the following ten years. In 1980, they signed an agreement with the reunified Socialist Republic of Vietnam for enterprises in East Germany to provide training to Vietnamese; between 1987 and 1989. The East German government viewed industrial trainee programmes not just as a means to increase the labour supply to local industry, but also as development aid to the poorer members of the socialist bloc. By the mid-1980s, Vietnamese, along with Mozambicans, comprised the main groups of foreign labourers in the GDR. From a population of just 2,482 in 1980, the number of Vietnamese residents of East Germany grew to 59,053 by 1989, with the largest influx in 1987 and 1988. They were concentrated mainly in Karl-Marx-Stadt, Dresden, Erfurt, East Berlin, and Leipzig. Their contracts were supposed to last for five years, after which they would return home.
Vietnamese guest workers received salaries of roughly M400/month, of which 12% went to the government of Vietnam, and another portion was paid in consumer goods—mainly sewing machines, bicycles, clothes, sugar, and soap—instead of cash, due to inflation. In terms of their characteristics and relations to mainstream society, they were almost the exact opposite of the boat people: they were the elite of their country of origin, rather than refugees from it, and they knew that they would leave Germany, so put forth little effort towards integrating into East German society or learning the local language. Despite the official rhetoric of socialist brotherhood, personal contacts between Vietnamese trainees and their German co-workers were discouraged; furthermore, pregnancies among female Vietnamese workers were punished by forced abortions. They were sometimes subject to xenophobic violence, and even when their physical safety was maintained, they became the target of resentment due to their preferential access to consumer goods. Despite their thoroughly socialist context, many helped their families to become petty capitalists, using raw materials and sewing machines sent back to Vietnam to privately produce fashionable clothing, such as imitation stone-washed jeans, and sell it to their neighbours.
Post-reunification.
After German reunification, the German government sought to reduce the populations of former guest workers in the east by offering each DM3,000 to leave the country and return home. Tens of thousands took this offer, but they were soon replaced by a further influx of Vietnamese asylum-seekers who had been employed as contract workers in other Eastern European nations. Throughout the 1990s, German attempts to repatriate the new immigrants back to their country of origin were not particularly successful, due to both Berlin's reluctance to forcibly deport them, and Hanoi's refusal to re-admit them; however, nearly four-tenths were barred from permanent residency in Germany.
Tensions between Germans and Vietnamese broke out into violence beginning on 22 August 1992 in the northeastern city of Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where neo-Nazis attacked Romani people, and then, on the third day of the riots, set fire to a housing complex where over 100 Vietnamese asylum-seekers lived. Some were injured, but none died; the police evacuated the Vietnamese residents but took no action against their attackers. A week later, extremist demonstrators burned a tent city in Berlin. Though some local residents cheered them on in Rostock, the rest of Germany was far more critical of their actions; 15,000 leftists staged a march through Rostock to condemn the violence. Rostock's 
mayor, Klaus Kilimann, remained out of town on holiday until the third day of the crisis, and was blamed for exacerbating the situation by not ordering the police into action earlier; he in turn blamed state officials, but after continuing pressure, finally resigned in late 1993.
Gangs became rampant in the Vietnamese community in Germany after reunification, with about half a dozen gangs competing for turf in the Berlin area in 1996, each with about 150 members. In the first 5 months of the year, there were 15 recorded killings among them. These criminal enterprises primarily smuggled cigarettes, but also branched out to gambling, prostitution, and video and audio piracy. In 1994, Vietnam agreed to accept the guest workers in exchange for US$65 million in development assistance, but by the end of the year only 67 were accepted instead of the agreed number of 2,500. Some investigators believe that Hanoi is reluctant to accept the guest workers because those behind the gangs operating in Germany may be high-ranking government officials or army officers.
Demography and distribution.
The population pyramid of Vietnamese Germans is very unusual. Vietnamese Vertragsarbeiter, who fell pregnant during their stay in the GDR, were subjected to forced abortions or forced deportions, so that most second generation Vietnamese are born after 1989.
The Vietnamese population in Germany is fairly young compared to the average and to other minority groups; 25% consist of children 15 and under, 63% are between the ages of 15-45, with only 10% in the 45-65 age bracket and 2% over the age of 65. 10,000 live in Berlin, of whom roughly one-quarter consist of Hoa (descendants of Chinese immigrants to Vietnam). Vietnamese, along with Koreans, form one of the only Asian groups in which men and women migrated to Germany in roughly equal numbers, at least among legal residents; in contrast, there are far more Thai and Filipino women than men in Germany, while the reverse holds true for Chinese and Indians.
Employment.
With the loss of their jobs, many Vietnamese guest workers turned to street vending, especially of smuggled cigarettes, while others subsisted on meagre unemployment benefits. Media portrayals of cigarette vendors were initially sympathetic, but by 1993, increasingly emphasised their link with organised crime. Cigarette vendors were subject to frequent police abuse; in Berlin, some Vietnamese residents even started a street fight with a police officer who frequently beat up one cigarette vendor, and threatened to hold a protest and block traffic to bring attention to the issue. By mid-1994, discussion of the police abuse of Vietnamese dominated local media; more than 85 investigations were opened against police officers in Berlin and surrounding areas, but in the end, only five officers were punished.
After the 1993 announcement that only those who had a legal means of financial support would be able to receive a residential permit, even more former guest workers, with little hope of achieving professional employment due to their poor German language skills, turned to self-employment. Floral stands and grocery stores were two common business choices. Others imported cheap products from Vietnam, especially garments, and sold them in small family-scale businesses; however, they could not compete with large discount retailers.
Due to the economic pressures on small retailers, the number of unemployed Vietnamese in Germany has shown an upward trend, rising to 1,057 individuals in 2000.
Education.
2008 studies by German education experts show that Vietnamese children are among the highest performing pupils in Germany (50% gaining entry into Gymnasiums). News articles have drawn attention to how children of former guest-workers are among the highest performing pupils in East German schools. Vietnamese students in East Germany who grow up in poverty typically outperform their peers, such as the Turks and Italians, and even native Germans.
Internal divisions.
Even after the reunification of their host country, the Vietnamese community in Germany remains divided. Initial sympathy by southerners towards northerners was replaced by suspicion, with the former boat people's staunch anti-Communism aggravating the former guest workers. The former boat people are also far better-integrated into society, and speak German well. However, the children of the boat people retain only tenuous links to Vietnamese culture; in many cases, their parents spoke to them in German rather than Vietnamese, with the hope of speeding their integration; as a result, the parents' German improved with the constant practise, while the children's Vietnamese skills atrophied. In contrast, many of the former guest workers from East Germany speak German poorly.
Religion.
The majority of Vietnamese migrants in Germany are at least nominal Buddhists. Vietnamese-style Buddhist temples they have set up serve as one of the most noticeable marks of their presence in the country, the most notable example being Lower Saxony's Vien Giac, the largest Buddhist pagoda in Europe. The temples, as well as street parades staged during important festivals, thus serve as important focal points for identity formation among Vietnamese Buddhists in Germany, and a sign that they are making themselves feel at home in their adopted country. At the same time, however, the temples and their visibility in public space have provoked backlash from German neighbours, who feel they are a symbol of non-assimilation to German society.
Catholics form a smaller community; as of May 1999, there were 12,000 Vietnamese Catholics in Germany, according to the statistics of the Conference of the German Bishops.
Notable people.

Moreno Merenda

Moreno Merenda (born 17 May 1978) is a Swiss footballer.
Career.
Merenda was born in Baar, and began his football career at home town club FC Baar. He made the transition to professional football in 1995, moving to the Swiss team FC Luzern. After signing for Liechtenstein-based FC Vaduz in 2001, Merenda enjoyed two personally successful seasons, where he managed to earn the interest of his next club FC St. Gallen. Although unable to secure a regular place in the lineup, he regularly scored for his side. He was thus held in high regard by fans and the press.
Being unhappy with the personal situation in St. Gallen, the club made the striker available for loan in December 2005.
In January 2006, Merenda joined FC Schaffhausen on trial.
The 2006–2007 season saw Merenda on top form again as he hit 22 goals in 34 appearances for his new club Neuchâtel Xamax, helping them earn promotion to the Swiss Super League. Having made 65 appearances for Xamax over two seasons, he rejoined his former club St. Gallen for the 2008-2009 season.
International life.
In his youth, Merenda also won Swiss U-21 honours.

PresbyLASIK

PresbyLASIK is a surgical technique for presbyopic visual correction using Excimer LASER ablation.
PresbyLASIK treatment uses the principles of LASIK surgery to create a multifocal corneal surface aimed at reducing near vision spectacle dependence in presbyopic patients. Among the presbyLASIK techniques, the Excimer LASER ablation creates a central area which is hyperpositive for near vision leaving the midperipheral cornea for far vision.
The first presbyopia treatment with excimer laser was done with the monovision technique LASIK. Some authors consider the PresbyLASIK the next step after monovision LASIK.
While an overall improvement in visual acuity has been recorded for both near and distance vision, safety and quality of vision have been compromised. It has been reported that 20% of presbyLASIK-treated eyes lost two lines of best-corrected visual acuity at distance, and 52% of eyes lost two lines of best-corrected visual acuity for near vision, while only 48% of eyes achieved 20/20 uncorrected visual acuity.
More recently, Supracor, a central presbylasik technique designed by Technolas, has been CE marked and approved for hyperopic presbyopes. Dr. Soler´s team, at Barcelona´s, have recently presented their one year results, at the 16th ESCRS winter meeting, and reported that more than 90% of patients had binocular distance and near vision of 0.8 or more, without glasses. Their results show symmetrical SUPRACOR (target -0.50 for both eyes) is safe, effective, and stable, in the short term. These patients will be followed-up as new protocols are being tested with asymmetrical Supracor ( emmetropia for dominant eye; -0.50 sphere for non dominant eye) aimed at younger presbyopic patients.
Surgical procedures for the correction of presbyopia, without reshaping the cornea, were proposed by Scharcker, M.D, using scleral band expansion (SBE), and J.T. Lin, Ph.D, using a laser scleral ablation in US Pat # 6,258,082 (2001). These procedures are different from the Presby-Lasik (monovision or bifocal) and are able to cause the true increase of accommodation of the eye. However, these procedures are still in their clinical trials pending FDA approval.

Uterine clear-cell carcinoma

Uterine clear-cell carcinoma (CC) is a rare form of endometrial cancer with distinct morphological features on pathology; it is aggressive and has high recurrence rate. Like uterine papillary serous carcinoma CC does not develop from endometrial hyperplasia and is not hormone sensitive, rather it arises from an atrophic endometrium. Such lesions belong to the type II endometrial cancers.
Diagnosis.
The lesion is found in patients who present typically with abnormal or postmenopausal bleeding or discharge. Such bleeding is followed by further evaluation leading to a tissue diagnosis, usually done by a dilatation and curettage (D&C). A work-up to follow would look for metastasis using imaging technology including sonography and MRI. The median age at diagnosis in a large study was 66 years. Histologically the lesion may coexist with classical endometrial cancer.
Prognosis and treatment.
Prognosis of the CC is affected by age, stage, and histology as well as treatment
The primary treatment is surgical. FIGO-cancer staging is done at the time of surgery which consists of peritoneal cytology, total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic/para-aortic lymphadenectomy, and omentectomy. The tumor is aggressive and spreads quickly into the myometrium and the lymphatic system. Thus even in presumed early stages, lymphadenectomy and omentectomy should be included in the surgical approach. If the tumor has spread surgery is cytoreductive followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.
The five years survival was reported to be 68%.
Staging.
Uterine clear-cell carcinoma is staged like other forms of endometrial carcinoma at time of surgery using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) cancer staging system 2009.
IA Tumor confined to the uterus, no or < ½ myometrial invasion
IB Tumor confined to the uterus, > ½ myometrial invasion
II Cervical stromal invasion, but not beyond uterus
IIIA Tumor invades serosa or adnexa
IIIB Vaginal and/or parametrial involvement
IIIC1 Pelvic node involvement
IIIC2 Para-aortic involvement
IVA Tumor invasion bladder and/or bowel mucosa
IVB Distant metastases including abdominal metastases and/or inguinal lymph nodes

Eucephalus breweri

Eucephalus breweri (formerly "Aster breweri" and "Chrysopsis breweri") is a species of aster known by the common name Brewer's aster. It is native to California where it grows in several of the local mountain ranges at subalpine elevations. Its range may extend into Nevada and Oregon. This is a perennial herb growing from a woody caudex to a maximum height anywhere between 10 centimeters and one meter. The stems are mainly erect and are coated in woolly fibers and resin glands. The abundant hairy, glandular leaves are lance-shaped to oval, pointed, and smooth or toothed along the edges. They are up to 5 centimeters long. The inflorescence holds several discoid flower heads which are packed with long yellow disc florets and lack ray florets. They are lined with hairy, glandular phyllaries. The fruit is a hairy achene.

Marine stratocumulus

Marine stratocumulus is a type of stratocumulus cloud that form in the stable air off the west coast of major land masses. The Earth spins on its axis, which results in the Coriolis force pushing the ocean surface water away from the coast in the mid-latitudes. This results in upwelling of cold water from below that creates a pool of cool water at the surface, which in turn cools the air directly above it. The surface cooling results in a large temperature inversion at the top of the marine layer. As the temperature is cooled to the dewpoint, water vapor condenses upon available cloud condensation nuclei, and forms a cloud. The stability of the marine layer prevents deep convection, and thus stratiform clouds are formed.
Climate scientists are currently investigating the detailed structure of marine stratocumulus clouds in an attempt to understand their effect on the climate.

Norman Bell (born 16 November 1955) is an English former footballer, born in Hylton Castle, Sunderland, who played in the Football League for Wolverhampton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers. He also played in the NASL for New England Tea Men.
Career.
Bell began his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers as an apprentice in 1971, and turned professional in 1973. He made his senior debut for the club on 23 September 1975 in a goalless draw with Aston Villa, but appeared only a handful of times in that season, which ended in relegation from the First Division.
Overlooked for the club's 1976–77 promotion campaign, he returned to the fold in the following season. With John Richards sidelined, Bell played regularly in the 1978–79 season, until breaking his leg in an FA Cup tie at Crystal Palace in February 1979. As a result of the injury and the addition of Andy Gray to the Molineux attack, Bell next featured in the first team more than a year later, in March 1980, when Wolves fielded a weakened side a few days before the League Cup Final. He found it hard to gain regular football and eventually left to join Blackburn Rovers in November 1981. In total, he scored 24 goals in 100 games for Wolves.
He stayed with Rovers for two-and-a-half seasons in the Second Division before moving into non-league football as player-manager of Darwen.
Since retiring from football Bell had various sales-related jobs before working with young offenders for Blackburn with Darwen Council. Bell's son Andy also became a professional footballer, and his uncle Harry Bell played in the Football League in the 1940s and 1950s.

Tanfoglio T95

The Tanfoglio Combat or Standard, also known as T(A)95 or EAA Witness Steel, is a modified clone of the Czech CZ-75/CZ-85 pistol. It is made in Gardone Val Trompia (Brescia), Italy by Fratelli Tanfoglio S.N.C.. 
The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard was introduced in 1997. The pistols are imported into the United States by European American Armory Inc. (EAA) and called the "Witness Steel". 
Some firearms enthusiasts consider the Tanfoglio T95 Combat/Standard pistol and Tanfoglio Force (the polymer frame version of the Combat) chambered in 10 mm Auto the "natural" heirs of the famous Bren Ten pistol. These handguns are all based on a beefed up CZ-75 platform and are close in appearance and size.
Design details.
The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard models are evolved copies of the famous CZ-75 pistol design, with manufacturing improvements. Tanfoglio introduced the firing pin block before CZ, and its operation is different than what is employed in modern CZ's. The firing pin block is kept in an upwards position, blocking the firing pin until the trigger is pulled. This causes the pin to fall, allowing the firing pin to move. As a result, the overall trigger operation is improved by the block (the CZ design actively pushes the block out of the way when the trigger is pulled, increasing overall weight to the pull). The Browning-style safety is improved to allow operation with hammer cocked or down (the CZ allows the safety to operate only when the hammer is cocked). The frame is simplified by omitting the magazine brake, reducing complexity as well as simplifying machining. The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard is offered in several variants in full sized, compact and subcompact pistol frame sizes. The steel surface finish can be military blued, polished "Wonder" finish, blue "Wonder" finish or hard chromed finish. 
The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard is a short recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a Browning Hi-Power style linkless system.
All T95 Standard and Combat models have the capability of being fired single and double action.<br>
The T95 Combat models feature an ambidextrous frame-mounted combat "switch" style manual safety that locks the sear so the trigger cannot be moved rearward as well as an internal firing pin block safety which stops the firing pin from traveling forward. The manual safety allows the Combat models to be carried with the hammer back, ready for use just by switching the safety off, a configuration known as "condition one". <br>
The T95 Standard models feature slide mounted hammer drop safety/decocker lever (ambidextrous as an option).<br>
Unlike most other semi-automatic pistols, the Tanfoglio Combat/Standard slide rides inside the frame rails rather than outside, similar to the SIG P210. This provides a very tight slide-to-frame fit, very good barrel lock-up and contributes to accuracy. A new slide with a slide-mounted safety/decocker lever is available as a factory option. Most variants have fixed iron sights with three dots for increased visibility that can be adjusted for windage. The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard models feature high capacity "double stack" magazines.
Magazines.
The capacity of the detachable box magazines of the Tanfoglio Combat/Standard pistols varies from chambering to chambering and the exact Tanfoglio Combat/Standard pistol variant. Technically the length of the magazine well in the handgrip dictates the shortest possible magazine length and accompanying minimum ammunition capacity. The maximum capacity of handgun magazines can however also be restricted by law in some jurisdictions. 
In newer pistols the magazines are positioned higher in the gun to get the rounds nearer to the feeding ramp. The required replacement part to position the magazine higher in older pistols that exhibit feeding problems is offered by Tanfoglio Germany for their customers without charge.
Tanfoglio and EAA offer the following magazine capacities:
There are also "semi-factory" parts and modified magazines available to optimize Tanfoglio pistols for IPSC competition and other racegun usage.
Significant differences from the CZ-75.
The biggest difference between the Tanfoglio Combat/Standard and the CZ-75 is chamberings; while the CZ-75 is available in 9x19mm Parabellum, .40 S&W, and .22 Long Rifle (in its Kadet model), the Combat/Standard can interchange calibers between 9x19mm Parabellum, 9x21mm, .38 Super Auto, .40 S&W, 10 mm Auto, .45 ACP and .22 Long Rifle.
To convert between chamberings requires only the removal and installation of the appropriate barrel/slide/spring ("top end") group and the insertion of the corresponding magazine. This enables a user to switch from 9 mm to .38 Super Auto or 10 mm Auto to .45 ACP—in other words, from one caliber to any of the others—in a few seconds, allowing shooters the flexibility of several calibers on one "registered" frame. The top end kits are readily available, and cost less than half the price of the complete pistol. Another advantage of this capability is that each caliber change is independent of any custom trigger fitting, stocks, etc. done to the lower part of the pistol. This allows a shooter to practice with inexpensive and ubiquitous .22 Long Rifle ammunition, then swap top ends and be ready for "social carry" or competition with no change in ergonomics or feel.
Another capability that the interchangeable top end groups provide is the different slide/barrel lengths. The shorter "Compact" top end can be mounted on the Standard frame, and vice versa. Thus, the most versatile frame is the Compact, which can be used with all lengths of slide as well as both Compact and Standard magazines.
Due to its larger magazine width, the Tanfoglio Combat/Standard pistol can be somewhat uncomfortable for shooters with smaller hands but with aftermarket grips can be made to be as thin as the M1911 while carrying an extra 3 rounds in .45 ACP. Also, the steel versions are heavier than their composite counterparts and pistols made by other manufacturers, such as Heckler & Koch and Glock, although this increased weight also reduces felt recoil. Accuracy varies but out of box the Tanfoglio Combat/Standard types are similar in accuracy to other semi-automatic service pistols. There are factory accurized variants such as the Gold, Gold Match, Limited & Combat Sport versions (known as the "Witness Elite" in the United States).
Variants.
The Tanfoglio Force is produced in several variants. The ammunition capacity of the default magazine of the variant (number of cartridges in the magazine + 1 in the chamber) is expressed after the chambering between brackets.

Parts Availability in the United States.
Due to the limited number of pistols imported into the US and their popularity, the Tanfoglio Combat/Standard pistol (while relatively inexpensive to buy) is more difficult to find parts for than some similar handguns. Most parts such as barrels or caliber conversion kits are only available through the US importer, European American Armory Corporation (EAA). Some aftermarket parts are available from Henning Wallgren, a Tanfoglio-sponsored pro shooter, and manufacturers such as Evolution Gun Works (EGW), Mec-Gar magazines and Wolff Gunsprings.

Transgender

Transgender is the state of one's gender identity (self-identification as woman, man, neither or both) or gender expression not matching one's assigned sex (identification by others as male, female or intersex based on physical/genetic sex). Transgender is independent of sexual orientation; transgender people may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, polysexual, or asexual; some may consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them. The precise definition for transgender is changing but nevertheless includes:
A transgender individual may have characteristics that are normally associated with a particular gender, identify elsewhere on the traditional gender continuum, or exist outside of it as other, agender, genderqueer, or third gender. Transgender people may also identify as bigender or along several places on either the traditional transgender continuum or the more encompassing continuums that have been developed in response to recent, significantly more detailed studies. Furthermore, many transgender people experience a period of identity development that includes better understanding one's self-image, self-reflection, and self-expression. More specifically, the degree to which individuals feel genuine, authentic, and comfortable within their external appearance and accept their genuine identity is referred to as transgender congruence.
Evolution of the term "transgender".
Writing for health professionals in the second edition of his reference work "Sexual Hygiene and Pathology" in 1965, psychiatrist John F. Oliven of Columbia University used the lexical compound trans+gender in the "Transexualism" section of “Primary Transvestism,” noting "'transgenderism' is what is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary transvestism." Crossdressing pioneer Virginia Charles Prince used the compound in the December 1969 issue of "Transvestia", a national magazine for cross dressers founded by Prince. In the mid-1970s both "trans-gender" and "trans people" were in use as umbrella terms.*In April 1970, "TV Guide" published an article which referenced a post-operative transsexual movie character as being "transgendered."() *In the 1974 edition of "Clinical Sexuality: A Manual for the Physician and the Professions", "transgender" was used as an umbrella term and the Conference Report from the 1974 "National TV.TS Conference" held in Leeds, West Yorkshire, UK used "trans-gender" and "trans.people" as umbrella terms.(), (2006). The Transgender Phenomenon () *However "A Practical Handbook of Psychiatry" (1974) references "transgender surgery" noting, "The transvestite rarely seeks transgender surgery, since the core of his perversion is an attempt to realize the fantasy of a phallic woman."()</ref> 'Transgenderist' was used to describe people who wanted to live cross-gender without sex reassignment surgery. By 1976, "transgenderist" was abbreviated as "TG" in educational materials.
In 1979, Christine Jorgensen publicly rejected "transsexual" and instead identified herself in newsprint as a "trans-gender" saying, "gender doesn't have to do with bed partners, it has to do with identity.” By 1984, the concept of a "transgender community" had developed, in which "transgender" was used as an umbrella term. In 1985, Richard Elkins established the "Trans-Gender Archive" at the University of Ulster. By 1992, the International Conference on Transgender Law and Employment Policy defined transgender as an expansive umbrella term including "transsexuals, transgenderists, cross dressers" and anyone transitioning.
Distinguishing transgender from transsexuality.
Several somewhat ambiguous and possibly overlapping definitions can be found for the two terms: "transgender" and "transsexual". Harry Benjamin invented a classification system for transsexuals and transvestites; he called his system the Sex Orientation Scale (SOS). In the SOS, Benjamin assigns transsexuals and transvestites to one of six categories based on their reasons for crossdressing, and the relative urgency of their need (if any) for sex reassignment surgery. Many transsexuals believe that to be a true transsexual, a person needs to have a desire for surgery. However, Benjamin's moderate intensity "true transsexual" needs either estrogen or testosterone as a "substitute for or preliminary to operation." There are also people who have had sexual reassignment surgery (SRS), but do not meet the definition of a transsexual, while other people do not desire SRS, yet clearly meet Benjamin Scale definition of a "true transsexual", such as Miriam Rivera.
In addition to the larger categories of transgender and transsexual, there is a wide range of gender expressions and identities which are contrary to the mainstream male-female binary. These include cross dressers, drag queens, drag kings, transvestites, genderqueer, etc. Some people take issue with "transsexual" because Virginia Charles Prince, who started the magazine "Transvestia" and built up the cross-dressing organization Tri-Ess, used "transgender" to distinguish cross-dressers from gay, bisexual and trans"sexual" people. In "Men Who Choose to Be Women," Prince wrote "I, at least, know the difference between sex and gender and have simply elected to change the latter and not the former." 
There is ample academic literature on the difference between sex and gender. For example, the Medilexicon Medical dictionary states that one's sex is a biological or physiological quality, while one's gender is a (psychological) "category to which an individual is assigned by self or others...". Therefore, transsexuality can be said to deal more with material aspects of one's sexuality, while transgender considerations can be said to deal more with one's internal gender disposition or predisposition, as well as the related social expectations that may accompany a given gender role. However, in pragmatic English, the sex and gender distinction is often ignored, so that "gender" is used to describe the categorical male/female difference and "sex" is used to describe sexual activity. 
There exists political tension between the identities that fall under the "transgender umbrella." For example, transsexual men and women who can pay for medical treatments (or who have institutional coverage for their treatment) are likely to be concerned with medical privacy and establishing a durable legal status as their gender later in life. Extending insurance coverage for medical care is a coherent issue in the intersection of transsexuality and economic class.
Transgender identities.
While people self-identify as transgender, the transgender identity umbrella includes sometimes-overlapping categories. These include transsexual; transvestite or cross-dresser; genderqueer; androgyne; and bigender. Usually not included are transvestic fetishists (because it is considered to be a paraphilia rather than gender identification), and drag kings and drag queens, who are performers who cross-dress for the purpose of entertaining. In an interview, celebrity drag queen RuPaul talked about society's ambivalence to the differences in the people who embody these terms. "A friend of mine recently did the "Oprah" show about transgender youth," said RuPaul. "It was obvious that we, as a culture, have a hard time trying to understand the difference between a drag queen, transsexual, and a transgender, yet we find it very easy to know the difference between the American baseball league and the National baseball league, when they are both so similar."
The current definitions of transgender include all transsexual people, although this has been criticized. (See below.) Intersex people have genitalia or other physical sexual characteristics that do not conform to strict definitions of male and/or female, but intersex people are not necessarily transgender, since they do not all disagree with their assigned sex at birth. Transgender and intersex issues often overlap, however, because they both challenge the notion of rigid definitions of sex and gender.
The term "trans man" refers to female-to-male (FtM or F2M) transgender people, and "trans woman" refers to male-to-female (MtF or M2F) transgender people. In the past, it was assumed that there were more trans women than trans men, but a Swedish study estimated a ratio of 1.4:1 in favour of trans women for those requesting sex reassignment surgery and a ratio of 1:1 for those who proceeded.
The term "cisgender" has been coined as an antonym referring to non-transgender people; i.e. those who identify with their gender assigned at birth.
GLAAD notes that, when referring to a transgender person, using that person's preferred name and pronoun regardless of their legal gender status (as not all transgender people can afford surgery or other body modifications) is respectful. Unlike 'transsexual', the word "transgender" should be used as an adjective rather than a noun — for example, "Max is transgender" or "Max is a transgender man" rather than "Max is a transgender."
Health-practitioner manuals, professional journalistic style guides, and LGBT advocacy groups advise the adoption by others of the name and pronouns identified by the person in question, including present references to the transgender person's past.
Transsexual.
Transsexual people identify as a member of the sex opposite to that assigned at birth, and desire to live and be accepted as such.
Transsexual people may undergo gender transition, the process of aligning one's gender expression or presentation with their internal gender identity. People who have transitioned may or may not necessarily identify as transgender or transsexual any longer, but simply as a man or a woman. Those who continue identifying as transsexual men or women may not want to ignore their pre-transition life, and may continue strong ties with other trans people and raising social consciousness.
The process of transition may involve some kind of medical gender reassignment therapy and often (but not always) includes hormone replacement therapy and/or sex reassignment surgery. References to "pre-operative", "post-operative" and "non-operative" transsexual people indicate whether they have had, or are planning to have sex reassignment surgery, although some trans people reject these terms as objectifying trans people based on their surgical status and not their mental gender identity.
Transvestite or cross-dresser.
A transvestite is a person who cross-dresses, or dresses in clothes of the opposite sex. The term "transvestite" is used as a synonym for the term "cross-dresser", although "cross-dresser" is generally considered the preferred term. The term 'cross-dresser' is not exactly defined in the relevant literature. Michael A. Gilbert, professor at the Department of Philosophy, York University, Toronto, offers this definition: "cross-dresser is a person who has an apparent gender identification with one sex, and who has and certainly has been birth-designated as belonging to sex, but who wears the clothing of the opposite sex because it is that of the opposite sex." This definition excludes people "who wear opposite sex clothing for other reasons," such as "those female impersonators who look upon dressing as solely connected to their livelihood, actors undertaking roles, individual males and females enjoying a masquerade, and so on. These individuals are cross dressing but are not cross dressers."
Cross-dressers may not identify with, or want to be the opposite gender, nor adopt the behaviors or practices of the opposite gender, and generally do not want to change their bodies medically. The majority of cross-dressers identify as heterosexual. People who cross-dress in public can have a desire to pass as the opposite gender, so as not to be detected as a cross-dresser, or may be indifferent.
The term "transvestite" and the associated outdated term "transvestism" are conceptually different from the term "transvestic fetishism", as "transvestic fetishist" describes those who intermittently use clothing of the opposite gender for fetishistic purposes. In medical terms, transvestic fetishism is differentiated from cross-dressing by use of the separate codes 302.3 in the DSM and F65.1 in the ICD.
Genderqueer.
Genderqueer is a recent attempt to signify gender experiences that do not fit into binary concepts, and refers to a combination of gender identities and sexual orientations. One example could be a person whose gender presentation is sometimes perceived as male, sometimes female, but whose gender identity is female, gender expression is butch, and sexual orientation is lesbian. It suggests nonconformity or mixing of gender stereotypes, conjoining both gender and sexuality, and challenges existing constructions and identities. In the binary sex/gender system, genderqueerness is unintelligible and abjected.
Androgyne.
An androgyne is a person who cannot be classified into the typical gender roles of their society; androgyny is independent of orientation. Androgynes may identify as beyond gender, between genders, moving across genders, entirely genderless, or any or all of these, exhibiting a variety of male, female, and other characteristics. Androgyne identities include pangender, ambigender, non-gendered, agender, gender fluid or intergender. Androgyny can be either physical or psychological and is independent of birth sex. Occasionally, non-androgynous people adapt their physical appearance to look androgynous. This outward androgyny has been used in fashion, and the milder forms of it (women wearing men's pants or men wearing two earrings, for example) are not seen as transgender behavior.
The term "androgyne" is also sometimes used as a medical synonym for an intersex individual.
Bigender.
A bigender (sometimes rendered as bi-gender, dual gender, or bi+gender) individual is one who moves between masculine and feminine gender roles. Such individuals fluidly move between two distinct personalities depending on context: whereas androgynous people retain the same gender-typed behaviour across situations, bigendered people consciously or unconsciously change their gender-role behaviour from primarily masculine to primarily feminine or vice versa.
Drag kings and queens.
Drag is a term applied to clothing and make-up worn on special occasions for performing or entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for other reasons. Drag performance includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. Drag can be theatrical, comedic, or grotesque. Drag queens have been considered caricatures of women by second-wave feminism. Drag artists have a long tradition in LGBT culture. Generally the terms "drag queen" covers men doing female drag, "drag king" covers women doing male drag, and "faux queen" covers women doing female drag. Nevertheless, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Some drag performers, transvestites, and people in the gay community, have embraced the pornographically-derived term "tranny" to describe drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross-dressing, however this term is widely considered offensive if applied to transsexual people.
Transgender people and the LGBT community.
The concepts of gender identity and transgender identity differ from that of sexual orientation. Sexual orientation describes an individual's enduring physical, romantic, emotional, and/or spiritual attraction to another person, while gender identity is one's personal sense of being a man or a woman. Transgender people have more or less the same variety of sexual orientations as cisgender people. In the past, the terms "homosexual" and "heterosexual" were incorrectly used to label transgender individuals' sexual orientation based on their birth sex. Professional literature now uses terms such as "attracted to men" (androphilic), "attracted to women" (gynephilic), "attracted to both" or "attracted to neither" to describe a person's sexual orientation without reference to their gender identity. Therapists are coming to understand the necessity of using terms with respect to their clients' gender identities and preferences. For example, a person who is assigned male at birth, transitions to female, and is attracted to men would be identified as heterosexual.
Despite the distinction between sexual orientation and gender, throughout history the gay, lesbian, and bisexual subculture was often the only place where gender-variant people were socially accepted in the gender role they felt they belonged to; especially during the time when legal or medical transitioning was almost impossible. This acceptance has had a complex history. Like the wider world, the gay community in Western societies did not generally distinguish between sex and gender identity until the 1970s, and often perceived gender variant people more as homosexuals who behaved in a gender-variant way than as gender-variant people in their own right. Today, members of the transgender community often continue to struggle to remain part of the same movement as lesbian, gay and bisexual citizens, and to be included in rights protections.
Pride symbols.
A common symbol for the transgender community is the transgender pride flag, which was designed by Monica Helms, and was first shown at a pride parade in Phoenix, Arizona, United States in 2000.
The flag consists of five horizontal stripes, two light blue, two pink, with a white stripe in the center.
Monica describes the meaning of the flag as follows:
The light blue is the traditional color for baby boys, pink is for girls, and the white in the middle is for those who are transitioning, those who feel they have a neutral gender or no gender, and those who are intersexed. The pattern is such that no matter which way you fly it, it will always be correct. This symbolizes us trying to find correctness in our own lives.
Other transgender symbols include the butterfly (symbolizing transformation or metamorphosis), and a pink/light blue yin and yang symbol.
Transgender people and feminism.
Some feminists and feminist groups are supportive of transgender people. Others are not.
Though second-wave feminism argued for the sex and gender distinction, some feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity and the feminist cause; e.g., they believed that male-to-female transition abandoned or devalued female identity, and that trangender people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes. Many transgender feminists, however, viewed themselves as contributing to feminism by questioning and subverting gender norms. Third wave and contemporary feminism more greatly accepts transgender people.
Feminist writer Janice Raymond asserts that sex determines gender, and that no practical difference is between the two. In her view, genitalia or "birth sex" or chromosomes deeply and permanently determine one's essential identity as a woman or man; trying to violate this divide is impossible, unnatural, and unhealthy. She argues that although transpeople may claim to feel like a certain gender, only a biological female can genuinely feel what occupying a woman's body is; e.g., such experiences as childbirth.
Transgender healthcare.
Mental healthcare.
Most mental health professionals recommend therapy for internal conflicts about gender identity or discomfort in an assigned gender role, especially if one desires to transition. People who experience discord between their gender and the expectations of others or whose gender identity conflicts with their body may benefit by talking through their feelings in depth; however, research on gender identity is relatively new to psychology, and scientific understanding of the phenomenon and its related issues is just beginning.
Transgender people may be eligible for diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) "only if transgender causes distress or disability." This distress is referred to as "gender dysphoria" and may manifest as depression or inability to work and form healthy relationships with others. This diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that transgender people suffer from GID; this misinterpretation has greatly confused transgender people and those who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are comfortable with their gender and whose gender is not directly causing inner frustration or impairing their functioning suffer not GID. Moreover, GID is not necessarily permanent and is often resolved through therapy and/or transitioning. Feeling oppressed by the negative attitudes and behaviors of such others as legal entities indicates not GID. GID neither implies an opinion of immorality; the psychological establishment holds that people with any kind of mental or emotional problem should not receive stigma. The solution for GID is whatever will alleviate suffering and restore functionality; this solution often, but not always, consists of undergoing a gender transition.
The terms "transsexualism", "dual-role transvestism", "gender identity disorder in adolescents or adults" and "gender identity disorder not otherwise specified" are listed as such in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) or the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) under codes F64.0, F64.1, 302.85 and 302.6 respectively.
In February 2010, France became the first country in the world to remove transgender identity from the list of mental diseases.
The issues around psychological classifications and associated stigma (whether based in paraphilia or not) of cross dressers, transsexual men and women (and lesbian and gay children, who may resemble trans children early in life) have become more complex since CAMH (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health) colleagues Kenneth Zucker and Ray Blanchard were announced to be serving on the DSM-V's Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group. CAMH aims to 'cure' transgender people of their 'disorder', especially in children. Within the trans community, this intention has mostly produced shock and outrage with attempts to organize other responses.
Transgender issues are both new in the scientific field and affect few people; many mental healthcare providers know little about transgender issues. Those who seek help from these professionals often educate the professional without receiving help. Many therapists who profess to know about transgender issues believe that transitioning from one sex to anotherthe standard transsexual modelis the best or only solution. This solution usually is good for transsexual people but is not the solution for other transgender people, particularly genderqueer people who lack an exclusively male or female identity. Instead, therapists can support their clients in whatever steps they choose to take to transition or support their decision to not transition while also addressing their clients' sense of congruence between gender identity and appearance. Availability of these procedures depends on degree of gender dysphoria, presence or absence of gender identity disorder, and standards of care in the relevant jurisdiction.
Transgender people and the law.
Legal procedures exist in some jurisdictions, allowing individuals to change their legal gender or name to reflect their gender identity. Requirements for these procedures vary from an explicit formal diagnosis of transsexualism to a diagnosis of gender identity disorder to a letter from a physician that attests the individual's gender transition or having established a different gender role. In 1994, the DSM IV entry was changed from "Transsexual" to "Gender Identity Disorder." In many places, transgender people are not legally protected from discrimination in the workplace or in public accommodations. A report released in February 2011 found that 90% of transgender people faced discrimination at work and were unemployed at double the rate of the general population. Over half had been harassed or turned away when attempting to access public services. Members of the transgender community also encounter high levels of discrimination in health care on an everyday basis.
In Canada, a private members bill protecting the rights of freedom of gender expression and gender identity passed in the House of Commons on February 9, 2011. It amends the Canada Human Rights code to help protect gender-variant people from discrimination by including gender identity and expression in the list of prohibited grounds for discrimination, as well as including gender identity and expression in the description of identifiable group, so that offences deliberately against gender-variant people can be punished to a similar extent as a racial-based crime. The bill may or may not be passed by the Senate.
In the U.S., a federal bill to protect workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity – called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act – has stalled and failed several times over the past two decades. Still, individual states and cities have begun passing their own non-discrimination ordinances. In New York, for example, Governor David Paterson passed the first legislation to include transgender protections in September 2010.
Nicole Maines took a case of whether she is allowed to use her high school's girl's bathroom, as a transgender girl, to Maine's Supreme Court in June, 2013. She claims being denied such access is a violation of Maine's Human Rights Act, though a state judge has already disagreed with her.
Transsexual people and science.
Brain-based studies.
Several studies have concentrated on whether sexually dimorphic brain structures in transsexuals are more similar to their preferred sex or to their birth sex. Researchers caution that there are known brain differences between homosexual and heterosexual persons and that the brain changes in response to hormone-treatment, which many transsexuals use. In order to know what in the brain is related to what feature of the person, studies of more uniform groups give clearer results than do studies of more mixed groups.
Androphilic MtF transsexuals.
Studies have consistently shown that specifically androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (sometimes called "homosexual MtF transsexuals" in studies) show a shift towards the female direction in brain anatomy. In 2009, the German team of radiologists led by Gizewski compared 12 androphilic transsexuals with 12 biological males and 12 biological females. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they found that when shown erotica, the biological men responded in several brain regions that the biological women did not, and that the sample of androphilic transsexuals was shifted towards the female direction in brain responses.
Rametti and colleagues used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to compare 18 androphilic male-to-female transsexuals with 19 gynephilic males and 19 typical (heterosexual) females. The androphilic transsexuals differed from both control groups in multiple brain areas, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the right anterior cingulum, the right forceps minor, and the right corticospinal tract. The study authors concluded that androphilic transsexuals are halfway between the patterns exhibited by male and female controls.
Gynephilic MtF transsexuals.
Conversely, gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals also show differences in the brain from non-transsexual males, but in a unique pattern different from being shifted in a female direction. Researchers of the Karolinska Institute of Stockholm used MRI to compare 24 gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals with 24 non-transsexual male and 24 non-transsexual female controls. None of the study participants were on hormone treatment. The researchers found sex-typical differentiation between the MtF transsexuals and non-transsexual males, and the non-transsexual females; but the gynephilic transsexuals "displayed also singular features and differed from both control groups by having reduced thalamus and putamen volumes and elevated GM volumes in the right insular and inferior frontal cortex and an area covering the right angular gyrus."
These researchers concluded that
Contrary to the primary hypothesis, no sex-atypical features with signs of 'feminization' were detected in the transsexual group...The present study does not support the dogma that transsexuals have atypical sex dimorphism in the brain but confirms the previously reported sex differences. The observed differences between MtF-TR and controls raise the question as to whether gender dysphoria may be associated with changes in multiple structures and involve a network (rather than a single nodal area).
In Sweden, non-androphilic transsexual women were tested when they were smelling odorous steroids. The results showed that the transsexual women demonstrated "a pattern of activation away from the biological sex, occupying an intermediate position with predominantly female-like features." 
Anne Lawrence, a sexologist, physician, and self-identified autogynephilic transsexual, has hypothesized that the desire by persons with autogynephilia, including some cross dressers and some transsexuals, to alter their body can be compared with apotemnophilia (alternately body integrity identity disorder if framed as an identity issue rather than a fetish). Some transsexuals argue that explanations that base on libido the desire to transition are unscientific or transphobic.
Mixed samples of MtF transsexuals.
Several teams of researchers have examined the brains or brain functioning of MtF transsexuals without separating the samples into androphilic (or "homosexual") and gynephilic (or "autogynephilic" or "heterosexual") types. Such studies have yielded contradictory results: some report differences between the (mixed groups of) MtF transsexuals and the non-transsexual controls, but other studies found no differences.
The corpus callosum was studied in MtF transsexuals because it is larger and differently shaped in men than in women. In 1991, a University of Texas team reported comparing the corpora callosa of 10 MtF transsexuals, 10 FtM transsexuals, 20 control males, and 20 control females. No significant differences were found.
In a pair of reports, the Dutch team that Dick Swaab led examined the volume and neuron count in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in six estrogen-treated transsexuals and one pre-treatment transsexual. They found the BSTc to be female-shifted (smaller) among the transsexuals than among the male control subjects. A subsequent study by Swaab found that the BSTc becomes sexually dimorphic only in adulthood, suggesting that differentiation of the BSTc does not cause transsexualism. Rather, the difference in the BSTc might instead be the result of a "failure to develop a male-like gender identity" (p. 1032). The BSTc has also been reported to be smaller in other sexually atypical populations unrelated to transsexualism.
Another team of Dutch researchers examined the effects of cross-gender hormone treatment on the brain in 8 male-to-female transsexuals and in 6 female-to-male transsexuals, finding that the hormones changed the sizes of the hypothalamus in a gender consistent manner. Treatment with male hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the male direction in the same way as in male controls, and treatment with female hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the female direction in the same way as female controls.
A 2003 study by Haraldsen and colleagues compared the performance of 52 persons with Gender Identity Disorder (33 from Norway and 19 from the U.S.) with that of 29 control subjects on a series of tests that tap into the functioning of different parts of the brain and on which men and women perform differently. The people in the GID sample "were either homosexually attracted by males or females (n=38), by both (n=3) or by neither (n=9)." No effects of transsexual status were detected.
Johns Hopkins researchers in 2005 reported on another test of brain functioning using test performance. The study subjects included 27 MtF transsexuals and 16 control men, and the authors reported that no female-typical patterns in cerebral lateralization or cognitive performance were found within the transsexual sample.
In 2009, UCLA researchers used MRIs to examine a mixed sample of 24 non-hormone-treated male-to-female transsexuals (6 were androphilic, and 18 were gynephilic), comparing them with 30 non-transsexual males and 30 non-transsexual females. The results "revealed that regional gray matter variation in MTF transsexuals is more similar to the pattern found in men than in women," except for the "right putamen.". They concluded that "These findings provide new evidence that transsexualism is associated with distinct cerebral pattern, which supports the assumption that brain anatomy plays a role in gender identity."
Gynephilic FtM transsexuals.
Brain-based research has repeatedly shown that female-to-male transsexuals have several male-like characteristics in neuroanatomy. In 2010, a team of neuroscientists compared 18 female-to-male transsexuals with 24 male and 19 female gynephilic controls, using an MRI technique called diffusion tensor imaging or DTI. DTI is a specialized technique for visualizing white matter of the brain, and white matter structure is one of the differences in neuroanatomy between men and women. The study found that the white matter pattern in female-to-male transsexuals was shifted in the direction of biological males, even before the female-to-male transsexuals started taking male hormones (which can also modify brain structure).
Another team of neuroscientists, led by Nawata in Japan, used a technique called single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) compare the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of 11 female-to-male transsexuals (attracted to women) with that of 9 biological females (attracted to men). Although the study did not include a sample of biological males so that a conclusion of "male shift" could be made, the study did reveal that the female-to-male transsexuals showed significant decrease in blood flow in the left anterior cingulate cortex and a significant increase in the right insula, two brain regions known to respond during sexual arousal.
Genetic studies.
In 2008, a study was performed to attempt to find a link between genes and transsexuality. The researchers compared 112 male-to-female transsexuals (both androphilic and gynephilic), mostly already undergoing hormone treatment, with 258 cis-gendered male controls. The male-to-female transsexuals were more likely than non-transsexual males to have a longer version of a receptor gene for the sex hormone androgen or testosterone. The research suggests reduced androgen and androgen signaling contributes to the female gender identity of male to female transsexuals. The authors say that a decrease in testosterone levels in the brain during development might prevent complete masculinization of the brain in male to female transsexuals and thereby cause a more feminized brain and a female gender identity.
Terms and typology.
The use of "homosexual transsexual" and related terms have been applied to transgender people since the middle of the 20th century, though concerns about the terms have been voiced since then. Harry Benjamin said in 1966:
...it seems evident that the question "Is the transsexual homosexual?" must be answered "yes" and " no." "Yes," if his anatomy is considered; "no" if his psyche is given preference.
What would be the situation after corrective surgery has been performed and the sex anatomy now resembles that of a woman? Is the "new woman" still a homosexual man? "Yes," if pedantry and technicalities prevail. "No" if reason and common sense are applied and if the respective patient is treated as an individual and not as a rubber stamp.
Many sources, including some supporters of the typology, criticize this choice of wording as confusing and degrading. Biologist Bruce Bagemihl writes "..the point of reference for "heterosexual" or "homosexual" orientation in this nomenclature is solely the individual's genetic sex prior to reassignment (see for example, Blanchard et al. 1987Coleman and Bockting, 1988[25, Blanchard, 1989These labels thereby ignore the individual’s personal sense of gender identity taking precedence over biological sex, rather than the other way around." Bagemihl goes on to take issue with the way this terminology makes it easy to claim transsexuals are really homosexual males seeking to escape from stigma. Leavitt and Berger stated in 1990 that "The homosexual transsexual label is both confusing and controversial among males seeking sex reassignment. Critics argue that the term "homosexual transsexual" is "heterosexist", "archaic", and demeaning because it labels people by sex assigned at birth instead of their gender identity. Benjamin, Leavitt, and Berger have all used the term in their own work. Sexologist John Bancroft also recently expressed regret for having used this terminology, which was standard when he used it, to refer to transsexual women. He says that he now tries to choose his words more sensitively. Sexologist Charles Allen Moser is likewise critical of the terminology.
Use of "androphilia" and "gynephilia" was proposed and popularized by psychologist Ron Langevin in the 1980s. Psychologist Stephen T. Wegener writes, "Langevin makes several concrete suggestions regarding the language used to describe sexual anomalies. For example, he proposes the terms "gynephilic" and "androphilic" to indicate the type of partner preferred regardless of an individual's gender identity or dress. Those who are writing and researching in this area would do well to adopt his clear and concise vocabulary."
Psychiatrist Anil Aggrawal explains why the terms are useful in a glossary: Androphilia – The romantic and/or sexual attraction to adult males. The term, along with gynephilia, is needed to overcome immense difficulties in characterizing the sexual orientation of transmen and transwomen. For instance, it is difficult to decide whether a transman erotically attracted to males is a heterosexual female or a homosexual male; or a transwoman erotically attracted to females is a heterosexual male or a lesbian female. Any attempt to classify them may not only cause confusion but arouse offense among the affected subjects. In such cases, while defining sexual attraction, it is best to focus on the object of their attraction rather than on the sex or gender of the subject.
Psychologist Rachel Ann Heath writes, "The terms homosexual and heterosexual are awkward, especially when the former is used with, or instead of, gay and lesbian. Alternatively, I use gynephilic and androphilic to refer to sexual preference for women and men, respectively. Gynephilic and androphilic derive from the Greek meaning love of a woman and love of a man respectively. So a gynephilic man is a man who likes women, that is, a heterosexual man, whereas an androphilic man is a man who likes men, that is, a gay man. For completeness, a lesbian is a gynephilic woman, a woman who likes other women. Gynephilic transsexed woman refers to a woman of transsexual background whose sexual preference is for women. Unless homosexual and heterosexual are more readily understood terms in a given context, this more precise terminology will be used throughout the book. Since homosexual, gay, and lesbian are often associated with bigotry and exclusion in many societies, the emphasis on sexual affiliation is both appropriate and socially just." Author Helen Boyd agrees, writing, "It would be much more accurate to define sexual orientation as either "androphilic" (loving men) and "gynephilic" (loving women) instead." Sociomedical scientist Rebecca Jordan-Young challenges researchers like Simon LeVay, J. Michael Bailey, and Martin Lalumiere, who she says "have completely failed to appreciate the implications of alternative ways of framing sexual orientation."
Blanchard's typology.
Blanchard's transsexualism typology characterizes trans women as having one of two motivations for transition. Whereas previous descriptions of transgenderism included very many combinations of sexual orientation, gender identity, and the desire to cross-dress, Blanchard interprets his evidence as suggesting that there were only two basic phenomena. One phenomenon was androphilia (male homosexuality), which ranged from typical gay men to, when extreme, androphilic or "homosexual transsexualism." The other phenomenon was autogynephilia, which ranged from typical cross-dressers to, when extreme, "autogynephilic transsexualism" (or "non-homosexual transsexualism"). Androphilic male-to-female transsexuals are characterized by sexual attraction to males and by overt and obvious femininity since childhood, whereas autogynephilic transsexuals are characterized by sexual attraction to females (or sometimes to females "and" males, or by asexuality) and whose presentations are internal and typically unremarkable until they choose to disclose them, typically later in life. There are community activists who dislike the theory.
Scientific criticism of the theory includes papers from Veale, Nuttbrock, Moser, and others who argue that the theory is poorly representative of MTF transsexuals, non-instructive, the experiments poorly controlled, or contradicted by other data. Many sources, including some supporters of the theory, criticize Blanchard's choice of wording as confusing or degrading.
Also the DSM V workgroup has been quoted as saying:
In contemporary clinical practice, sexual orientation per se plays only a minor role in treatment protocols or decisions. Also, changes as to the preferred gender of sex partner occur during or after treatment (DeCuypere, Janes, & Rubens, 2005; Lawrence, 2005; Schroder & Carroll, 1999). It can be difficult to assess sexual orientation in individuals with a GI diagnosis, as they preoperatively might give incorrect information in order to be approved for hormonal and surgical treatment (Lawrence, 1999). Because sexual orientation subtyping is of interest to researchers in the field, it is recommended that reference to it be addressed in the text, but not as a specifier. It should also be assessed as a dimensional construct. 
Blanchard is a member of the DSM V Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group chaired by Kenneth J. Zucker. Though it has supporters, the transsexual community has for the most part vehemently rejected Blanchard's typology theory.
By region.
Latin America.
In Latin American cultures, the travestis generally undergo hormonal treatment, use female gender expression including new names and pronouns from the masculine ones they were given when assigned a sex, and might use breast implants, but they are not offered and/or do not desire sex-reassignment surgery, and might be regarded as a gender in itself (a "third gender"), a mix between man and woman ("intergender/androgynes") or the presence of both masculine and feminine identities in a single person ("bigender").
They are framed as something entirely separate from transgender women, who possess the same gender identity of people assigned female at birth.
More recently, other transgender identities are becoming more known of, as a result of contact with other cultures of the Western world. These newer identities, sometimes known under the umbrella use of the term "genderqueer", along the older travesti one, are known as non-binary, that go along with binary transgenders (those traditionally diagnosed under the now obsolete "transsexualism") under the single umbrella of transgender, but not along crossdressers and drag queens and kings, that are held as nonconforming gender expressions rather than transgender gender identities when a distinction is made.
Nevertheless, deviating from the societal standards for sexual behavior, sexual orientation/identity, gender identity and gender expression have a single umbrella term that is known as "sexodiverso" or "sexodiversa" in both Spanish and Portuguese, with its most approximate translation to English being "queer".
Transgender people in non-Western cultures.
Asia.
In Thailand and Laos, the term kathoey is used to refer to male-to-female transgender people and effeminate gay men. The cultures of the Indian subcontinent include a third gender, referred to as hijra in Hindi.
Transgender people have also been documented in Iran, Japan, Nepal, Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, and the greater Chinese region, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China.
North America.
In what is now the United States and Canada, many Native American and First Nations peoples recognised the existence of more than two genders, such as the Zuñi male-bodied Ła'mana, the Lakota male-bodied winkte and the Mohave male-bodied alyhaa and female-bodied hwamee. Such people were previously referred to as "berdache" but are now referred to as Two-Spirit, and their spouses would not necessarily have been regarded as gender-different. In Mexico, the Zapotec culture includes a third gender in the form of the Muxe.
Other.
In early Medina, gender-variant male-to-female Islamic people were acknowledged in the form of the Mukhannathun. In Ancient Rome, the Gallae were castrated followers of the Phrygian goddess Cybele and can be regarded as transgender in today's terms.
Among the ancient Middle Eastern Akkadian people, a "salzikrum" was a person who appeared biologically female but had distinct male traits. "Salzikrum" is a compound word meaning "male daughter." According to the Code of Hammurabi, "salzikrūm" had inheritance rights like that of priestesses; they inherited from their fathers, unlike regular daughters. A "salzikrum's" father could also stipulate that she inherit a certain amount.
Mahu is a traditional status in Polynesian cultures. Also, in Fa'asamoa traditions, the Samoan culture allows a specific role for male to female transgender individuals as Fa'afafine.
Coming out.
Transgender people vary greatly in choosing when, if, and how to disclose their transgender status to family, close friends, and others. The prevalence of discrimination and violence against the transgender community can make coming out a risky decision. Fear of retaliatory behavior, such as being removed from the parental home while underage, is a cause for transgender people to not come out to their families until they have reached adulthood. Parental confusion and lack of acceptance of the child's transgenderism may be met with an effort to change their children back to "normal" by utilizing mental health services to alter the child's sexual orientation and what is seen as a "phase".

Hankey

Hankey is a small town on the confluence of the Klein and Gamtoos rivers in South Africa. It is part of the Kouga Local Municipality of the Cacadu District in the Eastern Cape.
History.
Hankey was established in 1826 and is the Gamtoos Valley's oldest town. It was named after the Rev. William Alers Hankey, (1771-1859) an ex-banker and the secretary of the London Missionary Society (LMS). He was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, (though the Missionary Society's successor body's obituary gives the place of his birth as London), the natural son of the London banker, merchant, Jamaica planter and treasurer of the Foundling Hospital, Thomas Hankey of Fetcham Park, and educated, according to his father's 1793 will, at Edinburgh University. Sir Maurice Hankey, later Lord Hankey, the creator of the modern UK Cabinet Office, was William Alers Hankey's descendant.
The purpose of the establishment of the village was to grow mielies and corn for the LMS main station at Bethelsdorp and also to carry out evangelistic work. The first property was "Wagondrift" owned by the Damant Bros. And although the town was planned for 250 families it started with 25 families. The first inhabitants consisted of a large number of Khoi, a few Mfengos, a few farmers and mixed "Gamtouer" (1700) descendants.
The LMS founded the station in 1822, terminated it in 1875 and in 1876 it became independent from the LMS. It became a Congregational Church as it is today. The first trustees of the LMS were Dr John Philip and the Rev. William Alers Hankey. The first missionaries were Messrs Miles, Melville, Williams, later the Philips' (Will Enowy and Thom Durant Philip)
Dr John Philip was superintendent. Some of the residents were Windvogel, Diederich, Abraham, Stuurman, Dragoonder, Armoed, Scheepers, Mahtjies, Gerts, Matroos, Konstabel and Kettledas. The first white farmers were Messrs. Wait, Salmon Ferreira, Stefanus Ferreira and the Damant Bros.
The first irrigation scheme on the Klein Rivier was started by James Wait in 1827 and completed in 1830. It extended for 3.5 miles and he was awarded 50 cattle and the use of 50 workers. 
What the papers said about the opening of the scheme on the Klein Rivier:
"...the course swung into action sending streams of water down its winding length ..."
People came from far and wide to view the spectacle and Dr Philip later declared it the greatest work of its kind ever undertaken in the Colony. Part of this irrigation scheme can still be seen today and forms part of the Hankey Golf Course.
The second irrigation scheme on the Gamtoos River, a provincial heritage site in Hankey today, was carried out by William Enowy Philip, the son of the Superintendent of the LMS, Dr John Philip. His inspiration was the window in the hill between Backhousehoek and Vensterhoek and was dug using pick and shovel and wheelbarrows. The length of the tunnel is 228 meters and the speed of construction was very slow - about 1 to 2 feet a day. It was started in April 1843 and completed in August 1844 – 15 months later. It was in use from April 1845 to 1970 - a period of 125 years. Note: This was the first ever tunnel scheme in South Africa.
A tragedy: The builder of the tunnel, William Enowy Philip, drowned on 1 June 1845 in the Gamtoos River where the present low water bridge to Milton stands and not as is usually believed, on the opening day of the tunnel. He and his niece, also a Philip drowned together when their small boat overturned at the Milton drift.
In 1822 Dr John Philip, the superintendent of the London Missionary Society established a mission station on the farm Wagendrift and named it after Reverend William Alers Hankey, the treasurer of the London Missionary Society. An irrigation tunnel constructed under direction of William Philip, the son of Dr John Philip, is today protected as a provincial heritage site.
On 19 August 2002, the remains of Saartjie Baartman were laid to rest on "Vergaderingskop", a hill on the edge of town.
As is the case with most South African towns, there are residential areas previously reserved for non-white residents set up on the outskirts of the town. In the case of Hankey these are Centerton on the western edge of the town ("on the opposite bank of the Klein River") and Weston, located about to the south-west ("on the opposite bank of the Gamtoos River").
Transport.
Hankey is located on the junction of the R330 and the R331 roads and the Avontuur Railway passes through the town.

John Corcoran (author)

John Corcoran is an American author who read only at a second-grade level until the age of 48. He managed to graduate from high school and college, and to work as a high school teacher and real estate developer without being discovered.
Early life.
Corcoran was raised in Santa Fe, New Mexico where his literacy stalled after second grade. He was one of six siblings, and his parents were too overwhelmed to notice the deficit. His teachers at school assigned him to the "dumb row" but were distracted by his disciplinary problems and soon forgot about his reading difficulties.
After graduating high school, he attended two junior colleges and then University of Texas at El Paso (then called Texas Western). Thanks to an athletic scholarship and aggressive, continual cheating, he was able to graduate in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in Education and Business administration.
His first job out of college was as, ironically, a high school English teacher. On his personal website, Corcoran describes some of the tricks he used to manage this.
"The students wrote their names on a seating chart and then pronounced them for me. To avoid reading the list, I asked them the next day to call out their names, claiming I wanted them to get to know one another."
He switched schools but continued as a teacher for 17 years before becoming a real estate developer in 1977. He was successful for ten years, and when his business faltered, he resolved to finally learn how to read. After thirteen months of tutoring, he was literate at a 12th grade level.
Life after literacy.
Since learning to read, he has written two books. He has since become a spokesman for literacy programs, as well as running his own foundation to help people learn to read. He created the John Corcoran Foundation, which trains tutors and helps students learn to read. He has appeared in the international media, but mostly his coverage is from American media. His appearances include an appearance on "The Oprah Winfrey Show", National Public Radio's "Eye on Books", and interviews in "USA Today" and other publications.

Bua Shpata family

Gjin Bue Shpata was part of the noble Albanian Shpata and Boua families. His father Pietro Bua Shpata was lord of Gjirokastër and Delvina.
His genealogical tree is not well documented. It was first outlined by Karl Hopf in his Chroniques Greco-Romanes (p. 531) and by K. Sathas in the 19th century but a newer study finds that those works have many mistakes and gaps. An anonymous source, based mainly on Hopf's work, gives this family tree
G. Schiró studied the genealogy of Spata based on the original sources, i.e. the "Chronicle of Ioannina" and the "Chronicle of Tocco", but also on the Venetian archives. He proposed a family tree quiet different from that of Hopf. For example, Pietro Bua had not only three sons but four. Gjin Bua Spata had not any son but only daughters. His daughter Irene married three times. He believes that the family was extinct with the death of Yaqub in 1416. Other people, mainly condottieri, with the name "Bua" are not blood relatives of this family but this name was used by many as first name since it became famous.

Mandy Minella

Mandy Minella (born 22 November 1985) is a Luxembourgish professional tennis player. Her highest singles ranking to date is world number 66 on 17 September 2012, and world number 47 in doubles on 29 April 2013. Minella has not won a WTA singles title, but has won two doubles titles on the WTA circuit, as well as eight singles and five doubles titles on the ITF tour.
Early life.
Minella was born in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg, to parents Mario and Anna Minella and started playing tennis aged 5.
Tennis career.
Early career (2000–2005).
In 2000, Minella debuted for the Luxembourg Fed Cup team, partnering Celine Francois in the doubles matches against Ukraine and Great Britain, losing both times. After again participating in Fed Cup in 2001 (where she won her first rubber), she began competing on the ITF Women's Circuit in the same year. In 2002, she received a qualifying wildcard into the WTA Tier III SEAT Open Luxembourg, losing the first round. She reached her first
ITF tour singles final in 2003, losing to Liana-Gabriela Balaci in three sets.
She lost again in ITF finals in 2004 (in both singles and doubles at the same tournament in Napoli), before winning her first singles title in Zadar later that year. A year later she won her second title, in Gardone Val Trompia.
ITF tennis (2006–2010).
In 2006 she won an ITF tournament in Caserta, as well as being a finalist a week later (both matches versus Alisa Kleybanova). In 2009, three years later, she won her fourth ITF tournament, in Tessenderlo, Belgium. In 2010, Minella had more success on the ITF Women's Circuit, winning two $25,000 events, in Lutz, Florida and in Stuttgart-Vaihingen, Germany, and finishing runner-up at one in Laguna Niguel, California.
2010.
In the qualifying draw for the 2010 US Open, Minella won all three matches and lost just one set. In her first appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam, she beat world number 47 Polona Hercog to advance to the second round. She continued her good performance by defeating world number 34 and Wimbledon semifinalist Tsvetana Pironkova. In the third round, however, she lost to world number four Venus Williams.
2012.
In 2012, Minella played her first Australian Open main draw. She was given direct entry, being ranked world number 110. She lost to American qualifier Jamie Hampton in the first round. She then went on to reach the final of a $100,000 ITF tournament in Cali. Despite defeating number one seed and world number 56 Marina Erakovic along the way, she lost the final to second seed Alexandra Dulgheru. She fared better in doubles, winning the title with Karin Knapp. As a result of her perforances, Minella broke into the top-100 singles rankings for the first time. She then played at the 2012 Copa Sony Ericsson Colsanitas, losing in the first round. She reached the final in doubles; her first WTA final of any kind. At the 2012 Monterrey Open, she faced Frenchwoman Mathilde Johansson and won in three sets. She followed this up with a win over Kazakhstani wildcard Yaroslava Shvedova in a tight three-setter. Minella lost to second seed Sara Errani in her first WTA quarterfinal. At the Nürnberger Gastein tournament, Minella defeated Johanna Larsson in the quarterfinals to reach her first WTA semifinal (against Wickmayer). Minella reached the third round of Wimbledon 2012 doubles, alongside partner Govortsova, losing to Llagostera Vives and Martínez Sánchez.
2013.
In 2013, Minella started her season at the 2013 Shenzhen Open, where she faced first seed Li Na but lost in straight sets. She then played the 2013 Moorilla Hobart International where she qualified for the main draw but lost to Monica Niculescu in the first round. In the doubles event she partnered Tímea Babos and went on to reach the final after the pair saved multiple match points in their first round match. They eventually lost to Garbiñe Muguruza and María Teresa Torró Flor in the final. Minella then continued her disappointing run of first round losses where she lost to Valeria Savinykh in the first round of the 2013 Australian Open. She partnered Megan Moulton-Levy in the doubles event and also saved multiple match points in their first round match, eventually going on to win. The pair then lost, however, in the second round. Minella then played the 2013 Open GDF Suez but suffered a first round loss in qualifying and another first round loss in doubles. She then went to play in the 2013 Copa Colsanitas where she had more positive results, reaching the quarterfinals in singles, beating Tatjana Malek and Tímea Babos before losing to Teliana Pereira. In the doubles event Minella again partnered Babos, going on to win the title; her first on the WTA tour. The pair did not drop a set all week.

Alonso de Figueroa y Córdoba

Alonso de Figueroa y Cordova (born 1589? Spain - died 1652); Spanish soldier who, in the days of the reign of Philip IV of Spain, temporarily carried out the position of Captain General and Royal Governor of Chile, besides president of its Real Audiencia of Chile. His government lasted for 13 months, between April 1649 and May 1650. He was the grandfather of the Chilean historian Pedro de Cordoba y Figueroa.
Earlier life.
Born in Cordoba; became a soldier in Lisbon. He arrived in Chile at the age of 16 years, in 1605, enlisted in the company of captain Bartolome Paez Clavijo, in the thousand man reinforcement for the Kingdom of Chile brought from the Iberian Peninsula by general Antonio de Mosquera to support the Arauco War. In the following years he rose through the ranks of the army of the Mapuche frontier. He was an alferez and captain of infantry and cavalry; becoming general commissioner of cavalry, finally reaching the rank of Maestro de Campo in 1625. He was also Corregidor of Concepcion during the government of Laso de la Vega. The governor Martín de Mujica y Buitrón showed his confidence in him, naming him shortly before dying of apparent poisoning to the key position of governor of Valdivia.
Governorship.
His appointment as governor of Chile was one of the last administrative acts of the viceroy of Peru Pedro Alvarez de Toledo y Leiva, Marquess of Mancera, who sent to Chile a list of three possible names. Figueroa was the only one alive among the names, and was formally invested in Concepcion in May 1649. He apparently arranged to start a new military campaign against the Mapuches and communicated with Peru asking for major resources. In Lima the new viceroy García Sarmiento de Sotomayor, Conde de Salvatierra, decided not to confirm Figueroa in his position in July 1649. This rejection discouraged Figueroa from his more ambitious projects. But the continuation of hostilities soon forced to him to put military columns in movement. On December 24, a fort near Valdivia was assaulted by the neighboring natives, guided by a deserter from the Spanish army. The attack was a Mapuche success, because almost all the garrison died and those that lived were taken prisoners and the palisade was set afire. More to the south, the Jesuit Agustín Villaza was kidnapped.
Figueroa moved troops into the neighborhood of Valdivia and Boroa. In addition he disembarked a respectable force in Carelmapu, under the command of just named governor of Chiloé, Ignacio de la Carrera Iturgoyen, with instructions to land on the continent and to face the tribes near Osorno. 
This was the situation of the kingdom on May 4, 1650, when the ship brought the new governor, Francisco Antonio de Acuña Cabrera y Bayona to Concepcion, ending the government of Figueroa. Figueroa y Córdoba was later named president of the Audiencia of Santa Fe de Bogota in 1652, but news of that appointment found him already dead.

Afternoon Drama

The Afternoon Drama, formerly known as the Afternoon Play, is a long-running radio drama programming strand, broadcast every weekday at 2.15pm on BBC Radio 4. Each play lasts for 45 minutes, and roughly 190 new "Afternoon Plays" are broadcast each year.
Generally around three quarters of the episodes are self-contained dramas. The rest are short series, usually between 2 to 6 episodes, such as "Number 10", "McLevy", "Pilgrim", or "Bad Faith" (the latter starring Lenny Henry). As well as original drama series, the "Afternoon Play" has included a number of adaptations of popular works such as "The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency".
History.
In one form or another, the "Afternoon Play" has been a feature of afternoons on Radio 4 since its launch in 1967, although the strict 45 minute format was not enforced until the reorganisation of Radio 4 by James Boyle in 1998, whereby the play directly follows the 2.00pm repeat of "The Archers". 
Several "Afternoon Plays" were amongst programmes held in 20 underground radio stations of the BBC's Wartime Broadcasting Service, to provide public information and morale-boosting broadcasts for 100 days after a nuclear attack.
The strand was retitled in February 2012 to bring it in line with BBC television's "Original British Drama" branding.
Listening figures.
In May 2009 it was announced that the listening figures for the "Afternoon Play" fluctuated between 1.1 Million and 800,000, making it one of the most popular outlets for new dramatic writing in the world. Monday's "Afternoon Play" is usually the most popular play of the week, and Thursday's is usually the least popular.

Cascadia State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of Oregon near Sweet Home along the South Santiam River. The park includes a day use area, campsites, hiking trails and 150 foot Lower Soda Creek Falls.
History.
Prior to settlers arriving, groups from the Molalla and Kalapuya tribes visited the park site to harvest huckleberries, fish and hunt. Cascadia Cave is nearby. The cave is an 8,000 year old American Indian petroglyph site considered to have the largest concentration of rock engravings in western Oregon. 
Willamette Valley settlers developed a bypass at the park site for horse drawn wagons. Old wagon ruts are still visible near where Soda Creek meets the South Santiam River. 
In 1896, George Geisendorfer opened a resort to capitalize on what he called the "curative powers" of Soda Creek's mineral spring water. The resort included a hotel, tennis courts, croquet course, garden and bowling alley. The hotel later burned and the property was acquired by the state of Oregon in 1940.
Hiking trails.
Cascadia State Park includes two primary hiking trails. The one mile Soda Creek Falls Trail follows Soda Creek to Lower Soda Creek Falls. The 3/4 mile loop River Trail descends to the South Santiam River.
Flora.
A forest canopy of Douglas-Fir, cedar and hemlock shades the ground, encouraging the growth of ferns, mosses and mushroom species.

Cline Falls State Scenic Viewpoint (also known as Cline Falls State Park) is a state park near Redmond, Oregon, United States. It is located on the Deschutes River. The park covers . It is administered by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department.
Cline Falls.
Cline Falls are located on the Deschutes River approximately four miles west of Redmond, Oregon. The falls were named for Doctor C. A. Cline (1850–1926) a Redmond dentist, who owned the land adjacent to the falls. The falls occur just north of the point where Highway 126 crosses the Deschutes River. In the 1950s, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department acquired property above Cline Falls for the purpose of creating a day use park.
Park grounds.
Cline Falls State Scenic Viewpoint is a day use park that covers on the east side of the Deschutes River. It is located on the south side of the Highway 126. Because Clines Falls are a short distance north of the highway, the falls are not within the park boundary.
The park has a large open lawn surrounded by ponderosa pine, western juniper, poplar, and locust trees that extend to the river’s edge. The park also includes riparian habitat, sagebrush covered uplands, and canyon rimrocks. These areas are home to blackbirds, Canyon Wrens, American Dipper, Song Sparrows, and finches. Other song birds pass through the area during the spring and fall migrations. Prairie Falcons and Golden Eagles are also found in the Cline Falls area.
As it flows by the park, the Deschutes River alternates between small rapids and calm pools. The rapids pass around a number of very large boulders. The calm sections create wetlands along the shore that attract a variety of wildlife. Canadian Geese and other water fowl are common in the wetlands along the river. A number of small mammals including the Great Basin Pocket Mouse and Sagebrush Voles are found in the park as well.
Recreation.
The park provides fishing access to the Deschutes River. The pools and eddies near large river rocks provide good habitat for trout; fishermen can find native rainbow trout, brown trout, and bull trout in the Cline Falls area.
The Deschutes River provides excellent rafting, kayaking, and canoeing opportunities. One of the longer paddle trips on the Deschutes is a section of river beginning at Tumalo State Park and ending at Cline Falls State Park. Another popular run begins at Cline Falls State Park and runs downriver to the Lower Bridge Recreation Site. This run requires a portage around Cline Falls, which is located about a half mile downstream from the park.
Cline Falls State Scenic Viewpoint is closed during the winter months. When it is open, there is no charge for using the park. Alcohol is not permitted in the park at any time. The ban on alcohol is enforced by the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Department. Park facilities include:
Unsolved crime.
On 22 June 1977, two undergraduate students from Yale University were attacked and badly injured in Cline Falls State Park. The two women were biking cross-country from Astoria, Oregon to the East Coast. On the seventh day of their trip, they camped at Cline Falls State Park. In the middle of the night, a truck drove over their tent with the two campers inside. Then the driver got out of the truck and attacked the students with an axe. After striking them a number of times, the attacker stopped and drove away. Both students survived. However, their attacker was never caught. One of the survivors later wrote a book about the ordeal, entitled "Strange Piece of Paradise".

It is a sandy beach of the Pacific Ocean within central Lincoln City along the length of the long D River, one of the world's shortest rivers.
The site provides public access to Wecoma Beach, part of Lincoln City's of beach. There is parking and day use facilities, and no fees. The site has access to river and ocean fishing.
Two of the world's largest kite flying festivals are held here, one in the spring and one in the fall, as well as a summer kite festival which features several professional kite fliers. It was named by "Kitelines Magazine" as one of the best places in the world to fly a kite. The area also has two year round Volkssport walking courses.
D River State Recreation Site is considered among the ten best places along the Oregon coast for whale watching. Whale watching guide volunteers are present one week in January and one in March to help visitors see and understand the whale migration.
The area of ocean where the D River enters the sea creates consistent year round surfing conditions suitable for intermediate skills.
Like many Oregon coast locations, flocks of seagulls are frequently present in winter. The most common species are Western Gull, Glaucous-winged Gull, and California Gull. Occasionally Thayer's Gull and American Herring Gull are observed here.

IT Baseline Protection Catalogs

The IT Baseline Protection Catalogs, or IT-Grundschutz-Kataloge, ("IT Baseline Protection Manual" before 2005) are a collection of documents from the German Federal Office for Security in Information Technology (BSI) that provide useful information for detecting weaknesses and combating attacks in the information technology (IT) environment (IT cluster). The collection encompasses over 3000 pages, including the introduction and catalogs. It serves as the basis for the IT baseline protection certification of an enterprise.
Basic protection.
IT baseline protection (protection) encompasses standard security measures for typical IT systems, with normal protection needs.
The detection and assessment of weak points in IT systems often occurs by way of a risk assessment, wherein a threat potential is assessed, and the costs of damage to the system (or group of similar systems) are investigated individually. This approach is very time-intensive and very expensive.
Protection may rather proceed from a typical threat, which applies to 80% of cases, and recommend adequate countermeasures against it. In this way, a security level can be achieved, viewed as adequate in most cases, and, consequently, replace the more expensive risk assessment. In cases in which security needs are greater, such protection can be used as a basis for further action.
The IT Baseline Protection Catalogs layout.
To familiarize the user with the manual itself, it contains an introduction with explanations, the approach to IT baseline protection, a series of concept and role definitions, and a glossary. The component catalogs, threat catalogs, and the measures catalogs follow these introductory sections. Forms and cross-reference tables supplement the collection available on the Federal Office for Security in Information Technology's (BSI) Internet platform. Here you can also find the Baseline Protection Guide, containing support functions for implementing IT baseline protection in procedural detail.
Each catalog element is identified by an individual mnemonic laid out according to the following scheme (the catalog groups are named first). "C" stands for component, "M" for measure, and "T" for threat. This is followed by the layer number affected by the element. Finally, a serial number within the layer identifies the element.
Component catalog.
The component catalog is the central element, and contains the following five layers: overall aspects, infrastructure, IT systems, networks and IT applications.
Partitioning into layers clearly isolates personnel groups impacted by a given layer from the layer in question. The first layer is addressed to management, including personnel and outsourcing. The second is addressed to in-house technicians, regarding structural aspects in the infrastructure layer. System administrators cover the third layer, looking at the characteristics of IT systems, including clients, servers and private branch exchanges or fax machines. The fourth layer falls within the network administrators task area. The fifth within that of the applications administrator and the IT user, concerning software like database management systems, e-mail and web servers.
Each individual component follows the same layout. The component number is composed of the layer number in which the component is located and a unique number within the layer. The given threat situation is depicted after a short description of the component examining the facts. An itemization of individual threat sources ultimately follows. These present supplementary information. It is not necessary to work through them to establish baseline protection.
The necessary measures are presented in a text with short illustrations. The text follows the facts of the life cycle in question and includes planning and design, acquisition (if necessary), realization, operation, selection (if necessary), and preventive measures. After a complete depiction, individual measures are once again collected into a list, which is arranged according to the measures catalog's structure, rather than that of the life cycle. In the process, classification of measures into the categories A, B, C, and Z is undertaken. Category A measures for the entry point into the subject, B measures expand this, and category C is ultimately necessary for baseline protection certification. Category Z measures any additional measures that have proven themselves in practice. 
To keep each component as compact as possible, global aspects are collected in one component, while more specific information is collected into a second. In the example of an Apache web server, the general B 5.4 Web server component, in which measures and threats for each web server are depicted, would apply to it, as well as the B5.11 component, which deals specifically with the Apache web server. Both components must be successfully implemented to guarantee the system's security.
The respective measures or threats, which are introduced in the component, can also be relevant for other components. In this way, a network of individual components arises in the baseline protection catalogs.
Threat catalogs.
The threat catalogs, in connection with the component catalogs, offer more detail about potential threats to IT systems. These threat catalogs follow the general layout in layers. "Force majeure", "organizational deficiencies", "spurious human action", "technical failure", and "premeditated acts" are distinguished. According to the BSI, the knowledge collected in these catalogs is not necessary to establish baseline protection. Baseline protection does, however, demand an understanding of the measures, as well as the vigilance of management. Individual threat sources are described briefly. Finally, examples of damages that can be triggered by these threat sources are given.
Measures catalogs.
The measures catalogs summarize the actions necessary to achieve baseline protection; measures appropriate for several system components are described centrally. In the process, layers are used for structuring individual measures groups. The following layers are formed: infrastructure, organization, personnel, hardware and software, communication, and preventive measures.
Managers are initially named to initiate and realize the measures in the respective measures description. A detailed description of the measures follows. Finally, control questions regarding correct realization are given. During realization of measures, personnel should verify whether adaptation to the operation in question is necessary; any deviations from the initial measures should be documented for future reference.
Supplementary material.
Besides the information summarized in the IT Baseline Protection Manual, the Federal Office for Data Security provides further material in the Internet.
The forms provided serve to remedy protection needs for certain IT system components. A table summarizes the measures to be applied for individual components in this regard. Each measure is named and its degree of realization determined. Degrees of realization, "considerable", "yes", "partial", and "no", are distinguished. Finally, the realization is terminated and a manager is named. If the measures' realization is not possible, reasons for this are entered in the adjacent field for later traceability. The conclusion consists of a cost assessment.
Besides the forms, the cross-reference tables another useful supplement. They summarize the measures and most important threats for individual components. Measures, as well as threats, are cited with mnemonics. Measures are cited with a priority and a classification. The table contains correlations between measures and the threats they address. However, the cross-reference tables only cite the most important threats. If the measure cited for a given threat is not applicable for the individual IT system, it is not superfluous. Baseline protection can only be ensured if all measures are realized.

Sri Lanka Premier League

The Sri Lanka Premier League (SLPL) is the premier Twenty20 cricket competition in Sri Lanka, held by Sri Lanka Cricket. Its first season was held in 2012 and it replaced the Inter-Provincial Twenty20.
History.
Background.
In May 2011, Sri Lanka Cricket announced a new franchise-based Twenty20 tournament in the country, modelled on the Indian Premier League. For this, the SLC signed a deal with Somerset Entertainment Ventures to organise the tournament. Seven teams, each representing a province, were to take part in the tournament. Somerset Entertainment Ventures have been given the rights to run the event for 15 years.
2011 tournament.
The first tournament was to be held at R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo between 19 July and 4 August. However, the Board of Control for Cricket in India refused to let the 12 Indian players selected in the tournament participate. Furthermore, allegations of corruption and incompetence by SLC and its handing over of the organisation to a previously unheard of Singapore-based Somerset Entertainment Ventures put the tournament in serious jeopardy. The tournament was postponed to 2012, with the former Inter-Provincial Twenty20 taking its place.
Sandiip Bhammer, Chairman of Somerset Entertainment Ventures said, "Last year, we had the Indian players coming and they were withdrawn about three to four weeks prior to the tournament launch. As a consequence of that, we were not able to deliver to the sponsors what we had promised."
Re-launch.
In February 2012, SLC signed a renewed deal with Somerset Entertainment Ventures to hold the tournament in August 2012. The matches will be held at Colombo and Kandy, with the seven teams as originally planned. The BCCI has said that Indian players in the SLPL was a possibility. The SLPL is in partnership with the MCC Spirit of Cricket initiative, similar to that of the one established by MCC and the DLF Indian Premier League in 2008. In June 2012, the tournament went through a major structural change. Instead of the provincial teams, there will be franchises owned by private owners like the IPL and BPL. Seven franchises will take part in the inaugural tournament.
The SLPL was officially launched on 16 July 2012 at Cinnamon Grand hotel in Colombo at an event attended by a host of media personnel and cricketers. Sri Lanka Cricket Chairman Upali Dharmadasa announced plans to add two more franchises in the following years to the league and cricket into all areas of the nation. It was announced that like the Indian Premier League there will be cheerleaders and other entertainment during the tournament. The night also saw the launch of the official website, mascot, theme song and logo of the SLPL.
First season.
The 2012 SLPL was played in Colombo and Kandy. The inaugural season of the tournament started on 11 August 2012 and lasted for 21 days with 24 matches scheduled, out of which 23 took place and 1 was washed out due to rain. The final was played in R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo. Every team played each other in a round-robin system. The top four ranking sides progressed to the knockout stage of semi-finals followed by a final. Uva Next defeated Nagenahira Nagas in a thriller and emerged as the inaugural SLPL champions
Second season.
The second season was set to begin in 2013 but was cancelled after the franchises breached payment deadlines.
League organisation.
Franchises.
The SLPL has undergone significant structural change since 2011. Unlike other cricket leagues, the SLPL will not have city-based teams but instead provincial teams to allow an entire province to associate themselves with a team and thus create a bigger following for the tournament. The first edition of the SLPL will include seven teams from seven provinces. Aside from Nagenahira and Uthura each of these provinces has had a team playing in the previous Inter-Provincial Twenty20. North Central and Sabaragamuwa Provinces will not have teams for the first season. Teams for all the provinces were limited to ensure competitiveness for the future.
In 2012 SLC adopted a franchise system, with the teams coming under private ownership instead of the Sri Lankan cricket board. The SLC would have owned all seven teams had the 2011 tournament gone ahead as planned, but the private commercial interest in owning teams has led the board to change its stance.
At auction, the seven SLPL teams fetched an average of US$4.3 million, building on a reserve of $3 million each.
The franchises are derived from the province-based teams used in the Inter-Provincial Cricket tournaments. The franchises are privately owned like the IPL and BPL. The reserve price of the franchise is $3 million with ownership up to seven years. Those interested in owning teams can be allowed to bid for up to three teams after which the franchises will be distributed to the highest bidders.
Player draft.
In June 2012, the tournament went through a major structural change. Given private ownership of the teams, there will now be a draft along the lines of the one held by the National Basketball Association in the United States. In the first year, a lottery will be held to determine the order in which players are picked. SLC will determine the value of the contract for each player in advance and the franchises will be made aware of the cost of the player. The players are likely to be drafted in two groups – the first consisting of players from Sri Lanka and the second all the foreign players. The draft is being seen as the best way to ensure that players are evenly distributed among the teams, making it a level playing field.
Squads.
The squads in the SLPL have been given team composition rules, current rule differ from that of the 2011 rules. Under the original 2011 system, SLC would have assigned players to each team. However with the private ownership there is now a draft. For the seven teams each franchise will have an icon player, with a maximum of 18 players, as opposed to the 16 – 18 in 2011. Each team can have six foreign players, up from five in 2011. There will be two foreign players who are also icon players. Teams will be allowed play a maximum of four foreign players per game. Out of the remaining seven players in the XI, one must be a Sri Lanka Under-21 international, out of three under 21 players in each team. Each squad will have a minimum seven Sri Lankan players. In 2011 each squad was to have a Sri Lankan captain, however new captains will be appointed following the new structural changes. For 2011 captains were Sanath Jayasuriya (Ruhuna), Mahela Jayawardene (Wayamba), Kumar Sangakkara (Kandurata) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (Basnahira); for Nagenahira and Uthura, Pakistan former captain Shahid Afridi and New Zealand former skipper Daniel Vettori.
Sri Lankan national selectors and cricket authorities agreed to blood as many youngsters. Almost all Pakistani national cricketers were invited to play in the SLPL. Salaries are have been lower than the IPL, with the highest at $30,000, with Shahid Afridi getting $35,000 in 2011. But in 2012 highest price $100,000 gives to Chris Gayle and Shahid Afridi getting $50,000.
Expansion.
Sri Lanka Cricket chairman Upali Dharmadasa announced in July 2012 that it was planned for the SLPL to expand with the addition of two more teams in 2013 with all nine Sri Lankan provinces represented in the league. The 2013 season was cancelled.
Marketing and broadcasting.
Marketing of the Sri Lanka Premier League is being conducted by the Somerset Entertainment Ventures who have been marketing the tournament with ambassadors, papare bands, theme songs, mascots and cheerleaders. The tournament will also have an opening ceremony. The Premier League is predicted to generate almost 580 million Sri Lanka rupees ($4.40 million) of annual income for the Sri Lankan economy. Sandeep Bhammer, chief executive of Somerset Entertainment Ventures said a 130 million rupees will also come from hotel accommodation alone, and will also create employment opportunities.
Logo.
Sri Lanka Premier League has changed its logo since 2011 and unveiled a new the current one at the relaunch of the new tournament.
Ambassadors and mascot.
The official mascot of the Sri Lanka Premier League is Silva the lion. The mascot was officially unveiled by the brand ambassadors, the Sri Lankan musicians duo Bathiya and Santhush. Bathiya and Santhush also composed the official tournament song.
Sponsors and partnerships.
The Sri Lanka Premier League has sponsors and partnerships deals with many online and broadcast partners including Wisden India, Marylebone Cricket Club on the Spirit of Cricket initiative and YouTube.
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. has been chosen as the title sponsor for SLPL.
Broadcasters.
Sri Lanka's premier sports broadcaster, Carlton Sports Network will broadcast all matches live in Sri Lanka. The SLPL will be broadcast around the world on Asian Television Network in Canada, ESPN3 in the United States, United Kingdom and the Caribbean, and ESPN and STAR Sports in Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh and Geosuper in Pakistan, as well as other countries in South and South East Asia. SLC president Upali Dharmadasa confirmed on 2 August 2012 that all SLPL matches will also be broadcast to a global audience via the SLPL's official YouTube channel, in the hope of benefiting the tournament through reaching more cricket fans around the world.

ATS (programming language)

ATS (Applied Type System) is a programming language whose stated purpose is to support theorem proving in combination with practical programming through the use of advanced type systems. The performance of ATS has been demonstrated to be comparable to that of the C and C++ programming languages. By using theorem proving and strict type checking, the compiler can detect and prove that its implemented functions are not susceptible to bugs such as division by zero, memory leaks, buffer overflow, and other forms of memory corruption by verifying pointer arithmetic and reference counting before the program compiles. Additionally, by using the integrated theorem-proving system of ATS (ATS/LF), the programmer may make use of static constructs that are intertwined with the operative code to prove that a function attains its specification.
History.
ATS is derived mostly from the ML and OCaml programming languages. An earlier language, Dependent ML, by the same author has been incorporated by the language.
Theorem proving.
The primary focus of ATS is to support theorem proving in combination with practical programming. With theorem proving one can prove, for instance, that an implemented function does not produce memory leaks. It also prevents other bugs that might otherwise only be found during testing. It incorporates a system similar to those of proof assistants which usually only aim to verify mathematical proofs—except ATS uses this ability to prove that the implementations of its functions operate correctly, and produce the expected output.
As a simple example, in a function using division, the programmer may prove that the divisor will never equal zero, preventing a division by zero error. Let's say, the divisor 'X' was computed as 5 times the length of list 'A'. One can prove, that in the case of a non-empty list, 'X' is non-zero, since 'X' is the product of two non-zero numbers (5 and the length of 'A'). A more practical example would be proving through reference counting that the retain count on an allocated block of memory is being counted correctly for each pointer. Then one can know, and quite literally prove, that the object will not be deallocated prematurely, and that memory leaks will not occur.
The benefit of the ATS system is that since all theorem proving occurs strictly within the compiler, it has no effect on the speed of the executable program. ATS code is often harder to compile than standard C code, but once it compiles the programmer can be certain that it is running correctly to exactly the degree specified by their proofs.
In ATS proofs are separate from implementation, so it is possible to implement a function without proving it if the programmer so desires.
Data representation.
According to the author (Hongwei Xi), ATS's efficiency is largely due to the way that data is represented in the language and tail-call optimizations (which are generally important for the efficiency of functional programming languages). Data can be stored in a flat or unboxed representation rather than a boxed representation.
An introductory case.
Propositions.
codice_1 expresses "predicates" as algebraic types.
Predicates:

In ATS code:
codice_3
where FACT (int, int) is a proof type
Example.
Non tail-recursive factorial with proposition or "Theorem" proving through the construction "dataprop".
The evaluation of fact1(n-1) returns a pair (proof_n_minus_1 | result_of_n_minus_1) which is used in the calculation of fact1(n). The proofs express the predicates of the proposition.
Part 2 (routines and test):
Compilation (compiles through gcc, without setting up garbage collection unless explicitly stated with -D_ATS_GCATS )
compiles and gives the expected result
Features.
Tuples and records.
With '|' as separator, some functions return wrapped the result value with an evaluation of predicates

A dataviewtype is similar to a datatype, but it is linear. With a dataviewtype, the programmer is allowed to explicitly free (or deallocate) in a safe manner the memory used for storing constructors associated with the dataviewtype.

The UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning (formerly: UNESCO Institute for Education) is one of six educational institutes of UNESCO. It is a non-profit international research, training, information, documentation and publishing centre on literacy, non-formal education, adult and lifelong learning. By linking educational research, policy and practice in these areas, UIL makes a special contribution in enhancing access to learning, and improving the environment and quality of learning for all in all regions of the world. 
UIL provides services in literacy, non-formal education, adult and lifelong learning to UNESCO's Member States, NGOs, and grassroots and community organizations, but also to partners in civil society and the private sector. In doing so, the Institute works in close collaboration with its Paris headquarters, with UNESCO field offices in different countries, with sister institutes and with national and international partners.
UIL is based in Hamburg, Germany. The Senate (government) of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg provides the Institute with premises close to the University, in a historic villa, which was built for the shipping magnate Albert Ballin. In February 2007, a country agreement was signed which defines the terms and conditions under which the UIL is hosted by the Federal Republic of Germany.
Mission.
UIL's mission is to see to it that all forms of education and learning – formal, non-formal and informal – are recognized, valued and available for meeting the demands of individuals and communities throughout the world. UIL responds to these demands and helps meet the challenges facing humanity (peace and democracy, sustainable development and poverty eradication, nurturing diversity, defeating HIV/AIDS, protecting the environment) with policy-driven research, capacity-building, networking, publications and technical services for Member States and non-governmental and civil society organisations, as well as private providers at their request.
Research.
UIL’s research covers appropriate concepts, good practice, favourable conditions and innovative approaches in the areas of literacy, non-formal education, adult and lifelong learning in different cultural contexts, including all modes of learning (formal, non-formal and informal), with a view to the creation of lifelong learning environments, the making of literate societies and the building of learning societies. All research activities aim at promoting adult and lifelong learning and at highlighting the contribution of learning to poverty alleviation, sustainable human development, democracy and critical citizenship.
Research work is mainly policy-driven and action-oriented. The research carried out by the Institute may take the form of individual case and country studies, comparative analyses, regional and cross-regional syntheses, international surveys, conceptual and position papers, co-operative and joint investigations with academics, partner institutions, governmental organizations, NGOs and CSOs, etc.

Unlike Excalibur, it is rare for characters to actually use Kusanagi in a combat since it is a ceremonial weapon. Instead, its magical properties are stressed. Because it is a Japanese weapon, it is sometimes misrepresented as a katana, even though the Kusanagi legend predates the katana design by a number of centuries. If archaeological evidence is to be taken into account, then Kusanagi would have been double-edged and much shorter than a katana.

Dene Olding

Dene Olding (born 11 October 1956) is an Australian violinist. He has had a distinguished career as a soloist in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, performing over forty concertos in recent years, including many world premieres. He is the concertmaster of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, first violinist in the Goldner String Quartet, and a member of the Australia Ensemble. 
Biography.
Dene Olding is the son of the husband and wife piano duo Max Olding and Pamela Page. He was initially educated at the Anglican Church Grammar School in Brisbane, but left at age 15—two years before he was due to graduate—to attend the Juilliard School in New York as a scholarship student of Ivan Galamian and Margaret Pardee. He graduated from Juilliard in 1978. He attended master classes with Nathan Milstein and had further lessons with Herman Krebbers and György Pauk. 
He joined the Australia Ensemble in 1982, and was also at that time leader of the Australian Chamber Orchestra. In 1985, he was awarded a Churchill Fellowship to further his musical studies. During that year, he won a Bronze medal at the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Belgium. 
He was concertmaster of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra from 1987 to 1994, and again since 2002. He is also a frequent guest concertmaster of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.
Dene Olding is regularly heard as soloist with all the major Australian orchestras and has worked with conductors such as Edo de Waart, Stanisław Skrowaczewski, Stuart Challender, Sir Charles Mackerras, Jorge Mester, Günther Herbig, Werner Andreas Albert and David Porcelijn. 
He gave the Australian premieres of Witold Lutosławski's "Chain 2" with the composer conducting, and the violin concertos by Elliott Carter and Philip Glass. In addition, he has performed world premieres of violin concertos by Ross Edwards ("Maninyas", a work dedicated to Dene Olding) and Bozidar Kos, and the Double Concerto for violin and viola by Richard Mills, written for himself and his wife, Irena Morozova.
He has made many recording, including one of sonatas by Brahms, Beethoven and Mozart, with his father Max Olding. His recording of Ross Edwards' "Maninyas" won the 1994 ARIA Award for Best Classical Recording, and the Cannes award. He made the first CD recording of concertos by Frank Martin, Darius Milhaud and Samuel Barber. He has recorded the violin concerti of Paul Hindemith with the Queensland Symphony Orchestra under Werner Andreas Albert.
He plays a Joseph Guarnerius violin made in 1720. In the Edwards, Martin, Milhaud and Barber recordings, he used the A. E. Smith violin he inherited from a previous Sydney Symphony concertmaster, Ernest Llewellyn.
He has conducted the Sydney Symphony and Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra.
Personal life.
Olding is married to Irena Morozova, a violist with the Goldner String Quartet and the Australia Ensemble. Together they have a son, Nicolai.
Olding is a practitioner of Aikido.

Budapest Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden

Budapest Zoo & Botanical Garden () is the oldest zoo park in Hungary and one of the oldest in the world.
It has 1072 animal species and is located within Városliget Park.
The zoo opened its doors on August 9, 1866. The park has 1–1.1 million visitors every year. The area is a nature reserve, and has some valuable art nouveau buildings designed by Kornél Neuschloss and Károly Kós .
More than 1000 species are living there. Most special animals there are the Komodo dragon and from December 2011 the Wombat.
The Zoo is located in the city centre, can be reached by Line 1 (Budapest Metro)
Official city card (Budapest card) owner gets a 25% discount for a single ticket into the zoo.
History.
The Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden is one of the oldest in the world. The idea of the foundation dates back to 1820-30s but it opened only on August 9, 1866. It was an initiation of a group of patriots among others Ágoston Kubinyi, geologist József Szabó, Ágoston Kubinyi, the Director of the National Museum, József Gerenday, the Director of the Botanical Garden of Budapest and János Xántus, a zoologist, ethnographer and the first director of the zoo.
At that time the zoo displayed mainly Hungarian species and some rare species of monkeys, parrots, camels and kangoroos, among others. Franz Joseph and Queen Elizabeth donated a giraffe and other animals to the zoo. The first Lion house opened in 1876 with lions and tigers. An elephant, a hippopotamus and a rhinoceros joined later on.
However, the initial enthusiasm waned and popularity of the zoo decreased. The new animals were expensive and the expenses of the company founded by the patriots exceeded the revenues. The management hired entertainers and comedians and the corporation was transformed into an animal and plant naturalizing company.
In 1873 Károly Serák was mandated zoo director. He directed for more than 30 years and he managed to maintain the zoo. He hired several artists, such as fire eaters, sword swallowers and tightrope dancers in order to attract people. The revenues increased and the zoo was able to buy several special or rare animals, such as a hippopotamus and a Sumatran rhinoceros. The zoo housed about 2000 species.
However, as the authorities increased the rental fee and the financial situation of the zoo deteriorated. The company went bankrupt after the Millenium in 1896.
In 1907 the zoo was auctioned and taken over by the capital city, Budapest. Supported by the mayor of Budapest, István Bárczy and his city developing program, a complete reconstruction took place between 1909 and 1912. The zoo was reopened on 20 May 1912. The entertainers were separated from the zoo and a botanical garden was created. The historic buildings of the zoo are mainly from this time too. Adolf Lendl, a zoologist was mandated zoo director. The institution was one of the most modern zoos in Europe.
The development was interrupted by the First World War. The zoo was almost entirely destroyed in the Second World War. At the siege of Budapest the zoo was bombed and most buildings and animals were destroyed. After the siege the remaining animals were eaten by the starving people of Budapest. From 2000 specimen only 15 survived.
In 1945 the zoo reopened with a few dozen animals. The damage was restored slowly. In the 1950s and 1960s there was a major modernization. Between 1956 and 1967 the Director General of the zoo was dr. Csaba Anghi. Under his guidance the zoo became once again one of the most modern zoos of Europe.
In 1994 Miklós Persányi was appointed Director General. The historic buildings were reconstructed. The animal habitats have been modernized, enlarged and made to look more natural.
In 2007 the first rhinoceros ever to be born with artificial insemination was born in the zoo.
In 2012 the General Assembly of Budapest has decided, that the zoo will take over part of the Amusement Park’s territory and introduce Pony Park, a family game park and zoo.
On the 14th February 2013 the zoo welcomed its first elephant calf since 1961.
In 2013 the zoo will acquire most of the Amusement Park’s territory and use it to display subtropical fauna and flora in a spacious glasshouse.
Exhibits.
The newest attraction of the zoo is The Magical Hill, found in the Great Rock. It presents the diversity of flora and fauna, the evolving of the diversity and the relationship between humankind and nature. It features more than 100 species, interactive games and illustrative models.
America Tropicana is the new name of the Palm-house. It presents the flora and fauna of the tropical climate American continent.
The Savannah Zone displayes giraffes, gazelles, white rhinoceros and many species of birds. The building also displayes small mammals and insects.
Australia Zone is found next to the Great Lake. It displayes unique birds, reptiles and amphibians of Australia. The show rooms of the northern part of the house presents animals active at night in reversed lighting scheme. The Hillhouse is also a part of the Australia Zone. It displayes cassowaries, kangaroos and wombats.
India House, the central building was built in 1912 by the plans of Károly Kós and Dezső Zrumeczky. It presents Indian lions, striped hyenae among others.
The building named after the first director of the zoo represents the wildlife of South-East Asian flora and fauna.

<doc id="19905369" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19905369" title="RAPTOR (software)">
RAPTOR (software)

RAPTOR is protein threading software used for protein structure prediction. It has been replaced by RaptorX, which is much more accurate than RAPTOR.
Comparison of techniques.
Protein threading vs. homology modeling.
Researchers attempting to solve a protein's structure start their a study with little more than a protein sequence. Initial steps may include performing a PSI-BLAST or PatternHunter search to locate a similar sequences with a known structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). If there are highly similar sequences with known structures, there is a high probability that this protein's structure will be very similar to those known structures as well as functions. If there is no homology found, the researcher must perform either X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, both of which require considerable time and resources to yield a structure. Where these techniques are too expensive, time-consuming or limited in scope, researchers can use protein threading software, such as RAPTOR to create a highly reliable model of the protein. 
Protein threading is more effective than homology modeling, especially for proteins which have few homologs detectable by sequence alignment. The two methods both predict protein structure from a template. Given a protein sequence, protein threading first aligns (threads) the sequence to each template in a structure library by optimizing a scoring function that measures the fitness of a sequence-structure alignment. The selected best template is used to build the structure model. Unlike homology modeling, which selects template purely based on homology information (sequence alignments), the scoring function used in protein threading utilizes both homology and structure information (sequence structure alignments).
If a sequence has no significant homology found, homology modeling may not give reliable prediction in this case. Without homology information, protein threading can still use structure information to produce good prediction. Failed attempts to obtain a good template with BLAST often result in users processing results through RAPTOR.
Integer programming vs. dynamic programming.
The integer programming approach to RAPTOR produces higher quality models than other protein threading methods. Most threading software use dynamic programming to optimize their scoring functions when aligning a sequence with a template. Dynamic programming is much easier to implement than integer programming; however if a scoring function has pairwise contact potential included, dynamic programming cannot globally optimize such a scoring function and instead just generates a local optimal alignment. 
Pairwise contacts are very conserved in protein structure and crucial for prediction accuracy. Integer programming can globally optimize a scoring function with pairwise contact potential and produce a global optimal alignment.
Components.
Threading engines.
NoCore, NPCore and IP are the three different threading engines implemented in RAPTOR. NoCore and NPCore are based on dynamic programming and faster than IP. The difference between them is that in NPCore, a template is parsed into many "core" regions. A core is a structurally conserved region. IP is RAPTOR's unique integer programming-based threading engine. It produces better alignments and models than the other two threading engines. People can always start with NoCore and NPCore. If their predictions are not good enough, IP may be a better choice. After all three methods are run, a simple consensus may help to find the best prediction.
3D structure modeling module.
The default 3D structure modeling tool used in RAPTOR is OWL. Three-dimensional structure modeling involves two steps. The first step is loop modeling which models regions in the target sequence that map to nothing in the template. After all the loops are modeled and the backbone is ready, side chains are attached to the backbone and packed up. For loop modeling, a cyclic coordinate descent algorithm is used to fill the loops and avoid clashes. For side chain packing, a tree decomposition algorithm is used to pack up all the side chains and avoid any clashes. OWL is automatically called in RAPTOR to generate the 3D output.
If a researcher has MODELLER, they can also set up RAPTOR to call MODELLER automatically. RAPTOR can also generate ICM-Pro input files, with which people run ICM-Pro by themselves.
PSI-BLAST module.
To make it a comprehensive tool set, PSI-BLAST is also included in RAPTOR to let people do homology modeling. People can set up all the necessary parameters by themselves. There are two steps involved in running PSI-BLAST. The first step is to generate the sequence profile. For this step, NR non-redundant database is used. The next step is to let PSI-BLAST search the target sequence against the sequences from the Protein Data Bank. Users can also specify their own database for each step.
Protein structure viewer.
There are many different structure viewers. In RAPTOR, Jmol is used as the structure viewer for examining the generated prediction.
Output.
After a threading/PSI-BLAST job, one can see a ranking list of all the templates. For each template, people can view the alignment, E-value and numerous other specific scores. Also, the functional information of the template and its SCOP classification are provided. One can also view the sequence's PSM matrix and secondary structure prediction. If a template has been reported by more than one method, it will be marked with the number of times it has been reported. This helps to identify the best template.
Performance in CASP.
CASP, Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction, is a biennial experiment sponsored by NIH. CASP represents the Olympic Games of the protein structure prediction community and was established in 1994. 
RAPTOR first appeared in CAFASP3 (CASP5) in 2002 and was ranked number one in the individual server group for that year. Since then, RAPTOR has actively participated in every CASP for evaluation purpose and been consistently ranked in the top tier.
The most recent CASP8 ran from May 2008 until August 2008. More than 80 prediction servers and more than 100 human expert groups worldwide registered for the event, where participants attempt to predict the 3D structure from a protein sequence. According to the ranking from Zhang's group, RAPTOR ranked 2nd among all the servers (meta server and individual servers). Baker lab's ROBETTA is placed 5th in the same ranking list.

Peter Losha

Peter Losha (; ) was a 14th-century Albanian ruler in medieval Epirus. He was the despot of Arta from 1359 until his death in 1374.
Life.
Losha was born in the area of Epirus in the early 14th century. His surname in Albanian literally means "pockmark".
In 1346-1348 Epirus became a part of the Serbian Empire and Albanian tribes were defeated by Stefan Dushan. In the consequent conflicts that erupted between the new Serbian rulers, the remnants of the despotate of Epirus and the Albanian clans Losha maximized his domains. He led the Albanian force against Nikephoros II Orsini at the Battle of Achelous that won him the rule of Arta, he founded his domain around Arta with the help of the "Mazarakii" and "Malakasei" clans. The domains he gained after the battle also included Rogoi (modern Filippiada) and Amphilochia as mentioned in the "Chronicle of Ioannina". To emphasize his suzerainty over the rulers in Epirus Simeon Uroš granted him the title of "despot", which was possibly an act of mere recognition of his rule after the battle of Achelous. 
In 1366, Thomas II Preljubović succeeded Simeon as ruler of Epirus. His rule marked a renewal of hostilities in the region as from 1367 to 1370 Ioannina, capital of Preljubović was under constant siege and blocked by the Mazaraki and Malakasa clans under Losha. A truce was signed when Peter's son Gjin was betrothed to Thomas's daughter Eirene. 
He died in 1374, because of a plague in Arta and his despotate passed briefly to his son Gjin before falling under the Despotate of Angelokastron and Lepanto of Gjin Bua Shpata.

Universal War One

Universal War One is a six-part French comic book limited series written, penciled, and inked by Denis Bajram. The series was initially published in France by Soleil Productions from 1998 to 2006. Due to its popularity, it was later translated and released in English by Marvel Comics. The genre is military science fiction, and the series deals with such ideas as time dilation and time travel. Following the comics standards in France and Belgium, each of the six part of the story has a approximately 50 pages length, making the whole story longer than usual limited series. The first issue of a follow up series "Universal War Two" is announced in French for 23 September 2013.
Plot summary.
The series begins at the onset of a civil war between the United Earth Forces (UEF) and the Colonization Industrial Companies (CIC), which comprises the various outposts and colonies beginning at the planet Saturn and beyond. The civil war begins when it is discovered that an immense black wall appears near Saturn, cutting the solar system in two. The black wall absorbs all light and matter. Enormous, incomprehensible and terrifying, "the wall" is centered on Uranus's moon Oberon, cutting off access to any planet beyond Saturn. Admiral Von Richtburg discovers that the CIC was attempting to begin a civil war, and orders the Purgatory Squadron, a band of soldiers given a second chance after courts-martial, to investigate the phenomenon known as "the wall".
After the Purgatory Squadron devises a method of breaching and investigating the wall, they are fired upon by a vessel of unknown design. Admiral von Richtburg orders his UEF 3rd Fleet into the wall, and thus begins the First Universal War.
Main characters.

Hat Rock State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of Oregon, administered by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. The park is located off the east side of U.S. Highway 730 in Hermiston, on the south shore of Lake Wallula behind McNary Dam on the Columbia River.
Flood basalt.
Hat Rock is a geological formation that, along with another outcropping rock in the park called Boat Rock, are thought to be exposed remnants of a 12-million year old basalt flow. Floods from the Ice Age eventually left these bedrocks, as well as others along the Columbia River Gorge exposed at the surface of the Earth.
It is 70 feet (21 meters) high.

Vapor–liquid–solid method

The vapor–liquid–solid method (VLS) is a mechanism for the growth of one-dimensional structures, such as nanowires, from chemical vapor deposition. The growth of a crystal through direct adsorption of a gas phase on to a solid surface is generally very slow. The VLS mechanism circumvents this by introducing a catalytic liquid alloy phase which can rapidly adsorb a vapor to supersaturation levels, and from which crystal growth can subsequently occur from nucleated seeds at the liquid–solid interface. The physical characteristics of nanowires grown in this manner depend, in a controllable way, upon the size and physical properties of the liquid alloy.
Historical background.
The VLS mechanism was proposed in 1964 as an explanation for silicon whisker growth from the gas phase in the presence of a liquid gold droplet placed upon a silicon substrate. The explanation was motivated by the absence of axial screw dislocations in the whiskers (which in themselves are a growth mechanism), the requirement of the gold droplet for growth, and the presence of the droplet at the tip of the whisker during the entire growth process.
Introduction.
The VLS mechanism is typically described in three stages:
Experimental technique.
The VLS process takes place as follows:
Requirements for catalyst particles.
The requirements for catalysts are:
Growth mechanism.
Catalyst droplet formation.
The materials system used, as well as the cleanliness of the vacuum system and therefore the amount of contamination and/or the presence of oxide layers at the droplet and wafer surface during the experiment, both greatly influence the absolute magnitude of the forces present at the droplet/surface interface and, in turn, determine the shape of the droplets. The shape of the droplet, i.e. the contact angle (β0, see Figure 4) can, be modeled mathematically, however, the actual forces present during growth are extremely difficult to measure experimentally. Nevertheless, the shape of a catalyst particle at the surface of a crystalline substrate is determined by a balance of the forces of surface tension and the liquid–solid interface tension. The radius of the droplet varies with the contact angle as:
formula_1 
where "r0" is the radius of the contact area and β0 is defined by a modified Young’s equation:
formula_2,
It is dependent on the surface (σs) and liquid–solid interface (σls) tensions, as well as an additional line tension (τ) which comes into effect when the initial radius of the droplet is small (nanosized). As a nanowire begins to grow, its height increases by an amount "dh" and the radius of the contact area decreases by an amount "dr" (see Figure 4). As the growth continues, the inclination angle at the base of the nanowires (α, set as zero before whisker growth) increases, as does β0:
formula_3.
The line tension therefore greatly influences the catalyst contact area. The most import result from this conclusion is that different line tensions will result in different growth modes. If the line tensions are too large, nanohillock growth will result and thus stop the growth.
Nanowhisker diameter.
The diameter of the nanowire which is grown depends upon the properties of the alloy droplet. The growth of nano-sized wires requires nano-size droplets to be prepared on the substrate. In an equilibrium situation this is not possible as the minimum radius of a metal droplet is given by
where "Vl" is the molar volume of the droplet, "σlv" the liquid-vapor surface energy, and "s" is the degree of supersaturation of the vapor. This equations restricts the minimum diameter of the droplet, and of any crystals which can be grown from it, under typically conditions to well above the nanometer level. Several techniques to generate smaller droplets have been developed, including the use of monodispersed nanoparticles spread in low dilution on the substrate, and the laser ablation of a substrate-catalyst mixture so to form a plasma which allows well-separated nanoclusters of the catalyst to form as the systems cools.
Whisker growth kinetics.
During VLS whisker growth, the rate at which whiskers grow is dependent on the whisker diameter: the larger the whisker diameter, the faster the nanowire grows axially. This is because the supersaturation of the metal-alloy catalyst (formula_5) is the main driving force for nanowhisker growth and decreases with decreasing whisker diameter (also known as the Gibbs-Thompson effect):
formula_6.
Again, Δµ is the main driving force for nanowhisker growth (the supersaturation of the metal droplet). More specifically, Δµ0 is the difference between the chemical potential of the depositing species (Si in the above example) in the vapor and solid whisker phase. Δµ is the initial difference proceeding whisker growth (when formula_7), while formula_8 is the atomic volume of Si and formula_9 the specific free energy of the wire surface. Examination of the above equation, indeed reveals that small diameters (formula_10100 nm) exhibit small driving forces for whisker growth while large wire diameters exhibit large driving forces.
Related growth techniques.
Laser-assisted growth.
Involves the removal of material from metal-containing solid targets by irradiating the surface with high-powered (~100 mJ/pulse) short (10 Hz) laser pulses, usually with wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV) region of the light spectrum. When such a laser pulse is adsorbed by a solid target, material from the surface region of the target absorbs the laser energy and either (a) evaporates or sublimates from the surface or is (b) converted into a plasma (see laser ablation). These particles are easily transferred to the substrate where they can nucleate and grow into nanowires.
The laser-assisted growth technique is particularly useful for growing nanowires with high melting temperatures, multicomponent or doped nanowires, as well as nanowires with extremely high crystalline quality. The high intensity of the laser pulse incident at the target allows the deposition of high melting point materials, without having to try to evaporate the material using extremely high temperature resistive or electron bombardment heating. Furthermore, targets can simply be made from a mixture of materials or even a liquid. Finally, the plasma formed during the laser absorption process allows for the deposition of charged particles as well as a catalytic means to lower the activation barrier of reactions between target constituents.
Thermal evaporation.
Some very interesting nanowires microstructures can be obtained by simply thermally evaporating solid materials. This technique can be carried out in a relatively simple setup composed of a dual-zone vacuum furnace. The hot end of the furnace contains the evaporating source material, while the evaporated particles are carrier downstream, (by way of a carrier gas) to the colder end of the furnace where they can absorb, nucleate, and grow on a desired substrate.
Metal-catalyzed molecular beam epitaxy.
Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has been used since 2000 to create high-quality semiconductor wires based on the VLS growth mechanism. However, in metal-catalyzed MBE the metal particles do not catalyze a reaction between precursors but rather adsorb vapor phase particles. This is because the chemical potential of the vapor can be drastically lowered by entering the liquid phase.
MBE is carried out under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions where the mean-free-path (distance between collisions) of source atoms or molecules is on the order of meters. Therefore, evaporated source atoms (from, say, an effusion cell) act as a beam of particles directed towards the substrate. The growth rate of the process is very slow, the deposition conditions are very clean, and as a result four superior capabilities arise, when compared to other deposition methods:

Holman State Wayside is a state park in Polk County, Oregon, United States, on Oregon Route 22 at the foot of the Eola Hills near the community of Eola. The wayside is administered by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department but was closed to vehicular traffic in 2007 because of ongoing problems with criminal activity.
The site was purchased by the State of Oregon in 1922. The land was originally owned by Thomas and Cora Holman, who had long allowed the public to water their stock and drink at a natural spring on the property, a purpose it had served since pioneer times.
The park is on a hillside forested with Douglas-firs, Oregon white oaks and bigleaf maples, and has a restroom, picnic tables, a water fountain and a walking trail. 
Bicycle and pedestrian traffic is still permitted in the park, although the restrooms are closed and as of 2007, they are planned to be demolished. In 2007, the Parks and Recreation Department said the closure of the wayside was temporary while solutions to the park's problems were discussed. A public hearing regarding the future of the wayside was held in September 2007.

Amenities at the park, which is north of Rockaway Beach along U.S. Route 101, include picnicking, fishing, and a Pacific Ocean beach. 
The entrance road from the highway leads across tracks of the Southern Pacific Railroad to a site with coastal vegetation, picnic tables, and restrooms. Although the park occupies only , its beach forms part of a stretch of public beaches between Tillamook Bay on the south and Nehalem Bay on the north. Sea stacks called the Twin Rocks can be seen offshore to the south near the community of Twin Rocks. The Oregon Coast Trail passes though the park. 
"Oregon Geographic Names" ("OGN") says that the name "Manhattan Beach" "strongly savors of real-estate activity". The Pacific Railway & Navigation Company, which opened a rail line through a nearby summer resort in 1912, named its train station "Manhattan Beach". The unincorporated community of Manhattan Beach had a post office between 1914 and 1975. In 1926, the postmaster wrote that promoters chose the name because Manhattan Beach, Oregon, was a watering place. "OGN" says the name might be "particularly inappropriate" considering that a native American word for Manhattan Island in New York probably meant "place of drunkenness" and that "no one gets drunk in Oregon, certainly not in watering places. No indeed."

The park is located at the intersection of Oregon Route 221 and Oregon Route 153 near Wheatland. The park entrance is across from Wheatland Road, which leads to the Wheatland Ferry. 
The site includes of a stand of second-growth Douglas-fir and a historic farmhouse. In the early spring trilliums are abundant.
The park formerly offered overnight camping, but now is day-use only. Amenities include picnic tables, restrooms, a covered picnic shelter, volleyball courts and horseshoe pits. Admission is free, but there is a fee to reserve the picnic shelter.
History.
Maud Williamson was a teacher at the school in Wheatland for many years. In about 1930, a new Wheatland School was built across the Dayton-Salem highway from the park, which then was a farm owned by Williamson.
Maud Williamson died in about 1933, and willed her timberland and house to the State of Oregon in memory of her mother, Ruby T. Williamson. Part of the park is situated on the original Donation Land Claim of Adam Matheny, one of the sons of Daniel Matheny, who established the ferry in Wheatland.
The adjoining Charles S. Williamson House is a Queen Anne-style house built in 1890 by Maud Williamson's father, who was postmaster of Wheatland for 12 years. Maud Williamson once lived there with her brother. The house is not open to the public.
A bronze plaque commemorating the donation of the site was placed in the park in 1934.

Human and Social Sciences Library Paris Descartes-CNRS

The Human and Social Sciences Library Paris Descartes-CNRS (in French "Bibliothèque de sciences humaines et sociales Descartes-CNRS") is one of the most important French libraries concerning sociology, linguistics and science education. The library collaborates with BNF (Bibliothèque nationale de France) as an associated pole ("pôle associé") on topics such as health and public policy, Ethics and bioethics, Health sciences and society, drug use and abuse, social psychology.
Being a "unité mixte de service" (mixed service unit) (UMS 3036), the library both depends of Paris Descartes University (Paris V) and the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). It is located in Rue des Saints-Pères, in the Latin Quarter.
History.
The collection of the library comes from two different origins :
Paris 5 University Human and Social Sciences Libraries.
A part comes from the former Human and Social Sciences collections of Paris Descartes University (formerly Paris V University) – the collections of social sciences and linguistics were held in the Sorbonne and those of science education in a library in Rue des Saints-Pères (6th district of Paris). Part of the major linguistics collection come from the private libraries of well-known 19th and 20th-century scholars such as Abel Hovelacque, Joseph Vendryes, and others.
CNRS Sociology Library.
The main part of the collection comes from the former Sociological Library of the CNRS. The collections increased during the second half of the 20th century. Georges Gurvitch gave books that he had purchased in the USA to the library and Maurice Halbwachs also gave a part of his private library to the Sociological Study Center ("Centre d’études sociologiques", CES) just after World War II. 
The library, founded by Lucienne Thomas, had the same fate as the CES. First situated in Rue de Varenne (7th "arrondissement"), it moved to Rue Cardinet (17th "arrondissement") in 1959. Its aim is to buy and make available books and knowledge to researchers but also to indicate the resources at a national scale: thus, the library is in charge of the "sociology" section of the "Bulletin Signalétique" (a kind of bibliography of French science articles) at the beginning of the 70s. 
Jacques Lautman, head of CNRS' Human and Society sciences department, decided to change its name in «Bibliothèque de sociologie du CNRS» (CNRS Sociology Library) in 1986. It moved one more time to Rue Pouchet (next to Rue Cardinet). Closed for a time while being reorganized, it re-opened in 2004 : it then held 50,000 sociological books and a collection of 1,500 periodicals. In 2006, it became part of the new Human and Social Sciences Library Paris Descartes-CNRS.
The library currently.
The library reopened at the end of 2006, at the same time that Paris Descartes Social Sciences Faculty moved from the Sorbonne to its new location in Rue des Saints-Pères.
It is a library reserved for scientific research, mainly for grad students, scholars, social and human scientists from all universities and scientific centers. It possesses a collection of more than 80,000 books and 2,000 periodicals (of which at least 500 subscriptions are running) - add all the electronics periodicals and reviews subscriptions bought by the University Library.
In 2008, the former "Friends of Centre d'Études Sociologiques'Society" (SACES) has entrusted to the library some photographic portraits of sociologists : Raymond Aron, André Davidovitch, Émile Durkheim, Georges Friedmann, Louis Gernet, Alain Girard, Marcel Granet, Georges Gurvitch, Maurice Halbwachs, Robert Hertz,Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, Marcel Mauss, Pierre Naville, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Jean Stoetzel. The complete collection consists of 15 framed photographs, size 32.5 × 38.5 cm (12.79 × 15.15 in). Part of this collection is available on the open archive MediHAL
But it is also an experimental library for new tool for scientific information circulation in France and abroad. The library plays an important part to digitize French Social Sciences reviews for Persée website (created by French Education Ministry). It also plays a leading role in several national projects of CNRS such as TGE-Adonis and Isore.

Frank Wyatt

Frank Wyatt (7 November 1852 – 5 October 1926) was an English actor, singer, theatre manager and playwright.
In a two-decade career on stage, Wyatt is best remembered for his roles with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company from 1889 to 1891, and in particular for creating the role of the Duke of Plaza-Toro in Gilbert and Sullivan's hit comic opera "The Gondoliers". Later, Wyatt and his wife owned and managed the Trafalgar Square Theatre (known after 1895 as the Duke of York's Theatre).
Biography.
Wyatt was born Francis Nevill Gunning in Greenwich in London, England. He studied art at the Royal Academy and became an illustrator on the "Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News" and successfully exhibited and sold paintings.
In 1877, Wyatt began a stage career in a one-line part in the farce "On Bail" by W. S. Gilbert at the Criterion Theatre, where he continued to play in farces for three years under Charles Wyndham. Over the next two decades, Wyatt appeared regularly before London audiences in burlesques at the Gaiety Theatre, London and character roles in plays and operettas in various West End theatres. In 1880, he played Punch in the pantomime "Mother Goose and the Enchanted Beauty" at Drury Lane Theatre with Arthur Roberts and Kate Santley. In 1884, he was praised for "by far the best piece of comic character-drawing" in creating his role of Captaine Coqueluche in H. B. Farnie's adaptation of Edmond Audran's operetta "The Grand Mogul", starring Florence St. John, Fred Leslie and Roberts. Also in 1884, he had a success in a Shakespeare role with Henry Irving, Andrew Aguecheek in "Twelfth Night" at the Lyceum Theatre, London. In 1885, he created the role of Ravennes in "Erminie". He appeared in the 1888 burlesque of "Atalanta" at the Strand Theatre with Willie Warde and Tom Squire.
D'Oyly Carte and later theatre career.
On 8 June 1889, W. S. Gilbert visited Arthur Sullivan at his home in London to read through the draft of his new opera, "The Gondoliers". In the evening they both went to see Wyatt performing the role of Don Trocadero in the operetta "Paul Jones", in which he had received good notices, as they were looking for a replacement for George Grossmith, who was leaving the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in August. Satisfied by what they had seen, Wyatt was subsequently invited to join the D'Oyly Carte organisation on a two-year contract to create the role of the Duke of Plaza-Toro at the Savoy Theatre in the original production of "The Gondoliers". Wyatt appeared in the role from December 1889 to June 1891. "Punch" said of his performance: "Mr. Frank Wyatt, as 'the new boy' at the Savoy School, doesn't, as yet, seem quite happy; but it cannot be expected that he should feel 'quite at home', when he has only recently arrived at a new school." H. M. Walbrook recalled, however, that Wyatt was "a tall, handsome, nimble and very polished comedian, who immediately acted, sang and danced the part of the Duke of Plaza Toro as it has never been rendered since."
Gilbert and Sullivan reviewer Michael Walters claimed that Wyatt was cast by Gilbert because he was a good actor, but that he could not sing, so in performances he spoke the words in time with the tune. However, none of Wyatt's reviews mentions this, and on the contrary, they describe his effectiveness in songs allotted to him. Wyatt next created the role of Baboo Currie in "The Nautch Girl" by Dance and Solomon, playing the part from June to December 1891, when his contract with D'Oyly Carte ended.
From January to July 1892 he appeared at the Lyric Theatre as Arrostino Annegato in "The Mountebanks" by Gilbert and Alfred Cellier. He then played Woodpecker Tapping in "Haste to the Wedding", a short-lived comic opera by Gilbert and George Grossmith at the Criterion Theatre. Also in 1892, he appeared in London in "Ma Mie Rosette" by Ivan Caryll and George Dance, together with Jessie Bond and Courtice Pounds On tour, Wyatt appeared in "Ma'm'zelle Nitouche" in 1893. Later that year, he returned to London in a farce called "A Screw Loose" at the Vaudeville Theatre. In 1896, Wyatt was seen in "The Star of India" at Princess's Theatre, London. He appeared in "The Mermaids" and other pieces in 1897 at the Avenue Theatre. His appearances became fewer after this, although he performed in new works as late as 1900 in "The Gay Pretenders" by George Grossmith, Jr. at the Globe Theatre.
Writing and theatre management.
Wyatt also wrote a number of plays, the best known being "The Two Recruits" (1890) and "Our Regiment", both of which were produced at Toole's Theatre under the management of his wife, Violet Melnotte (1855–1935), a former actress who had appeared in 1877 in Richard D'Oyly Carte's own comic opera "Happy Hampstead". He also wrote a grand opera called "Galatea" that was produced by the Carl Rosa Opera Company. In 1892, the Trafalgar Square Theatre (renamed the Duke of York's Theatre in 1895) was built for Melnotte and Wyatt and was managed by them intermittently thereafter until her death in 1935. Violet and Frank Wyatt had one son, Nevil Francis Gunning Wyatt. Wyatt's half sister was Ivy Bonheur, a principal soprano with D'Oyly Carte touring companies in 1887–88, whose birth name was Eveline Medora Gunning.
Wyatt died in a nursing home in London in 1926 at the age of 73.

Falling Creek Camp

Falling Creek Camp is a residential camp for boys in Tuxedo, North Carolina. Falling Creek was founded in 1968 by Jim Miller. Four sessions are held each summer, and range from six- to 27-day camps.
History.
Falling Creek Camp was founded as a boys-only camp in southern Henderson County as a brother camp to nearby Camp Greystone - a camp for girls only. The first session was held in summer 1969 with an original enrollment of 110 boys.
The camp has seen a couple of ownership and directorship changes since the camp opened. Yates and Marisa Pharr are the current directors, taking over Falling Creek in 2005.
Camp Experience.
The camp's structure allows campers to do the activities they want to do while still having a manageable and steady schedule, a philosophy known as "structured freedom." The activities campers can experience include both regularly scheduled daily activities and a variety of activities they can do during their two free periods. The activities all fall into four categories: outdoor adventure, water, sports, and camp classics.
The camp is split up into four divisions, separated by the ages and grades of the campers. The cabin areas are organized into different tribes, from youngest to oldest: Cherokee, Catawba, Tuscarora, and Iroquois. Campers live in rustic cabins of seven or eight boys with one and sometimes two counselors. The cabin mates spend a large amount of time together; in addition to sharing the same living quarters, they eat together in the dining hall, go on occasional overnight outings, and have cabin activities.
Registration.
Falling Creek charges around $1000 per week, depending on the camp session chosen. The rate is an all-inclusive fee, and campers never need to pay for anything out of pocket. A camp store is also operated during session, where campers can use their "allowances" (accounts set up by their parents when dropping their sons off) to buy certain items.
"Time" magazine article.
The camp received some notoriety when the Aug. 6, 2007 American issue of "Time" featured the camp on the cover. The article, called "The Myth About Boys" was researched on-location at Falling Creek in July 2007.

Solungen

Solungen was a Norwegian newspaper, published in Åsnes in Hedmark county.
"Solungen" was started in Flisa on 8 September 1904 by Evald Bosse (not to be confused with Ewald Bosse). As indicated by its name, it covered the district Solør and had the subtitle "Organ for Solørdistrikterne". It was an apolitical, or non-partisan, newspaper. When Bosse moved from Flisa in 1906, he wanted to sell it. His asking price was , but J. M. Enger and August Embretsen from the local labour movement bargained the price down to NOK 6,000. The Norwegian Labour Party formally took over the newspaper on 1 January 1907. Embretsen became the first labour mayor in Åsnes in 1910. The newspaper faced problems in the local community, especially with lack of advertisements, but also when the landlord of their headquarters unilaterally stopped the tenancy in the summer of 1907. The newspaper was moved to Kjellmyra.
"Solungen" pretended to be an organ for the whole of Hedmark county, as the Labour Party had no other newspaper here. The local party representatives and the national board had agreed to it by September 1907. Outside of Solør it was puiblished as "Hedemarkens Amts Socialdemokrat (Solungen)" from August 1908. People elsewhere in the county grew unsatisfied with this, and started "Demokraten" in September 1909, which covered the northern parts of the country, Hamar, Hedemarken and Østerdalen.
The newspaper's chief editors were Evald Bosse from 1904 to 1906, then Cornelius Holmboe from 1907 to April 1908, Ola Solberg from April 1908 to April 1909, Ivar Færder from April 1909 to May 1910, Waldemar Carlsen from May 1910 to October 1913, Johs. Dahl from October 1913 to his death next month, then a committee until April 1914, then E. F. Lenning from April to July 1914 and finally Ole Ruud.
"Solungen" survived the local conservative newspaper, "Solørposten" which went defunct in June 1913. "Solungen" itself went defunct after its last issue on 31 December 1914. It was merged into "Glommendalens Social-Demokrat" from 1915. Many years later a new newspaper tried to launch itself as "Avisen Solungen", but was persuaded (through a settlement) to use "SolungAvisa" for trademark reasons as the newspaper "Glåmdalen", a successor of "Glommendalens Social-Demokrat", as late as 29 February 2008 had applied to the Norwegian Industrial Property Office for the right of the name of the newspaper which it had absorbed in 1915.

Francisco Antonio de Acuña Cabrera y Bayona (Spain; 1597 – Lima; 1662) was a Spanish, soldier and governor of the Kingdom of Chile between 1650 and 1656. He was son of Antonio de Cabrera y Acuña y de Agueda de Bayona, was a knight of the Order of Santiago and a professional military man. After serving in Flanders and France, he went to Peru as Maestre de Campo of El Callao and a general, being designated later Royal Governor of Chile.
Governor of Chile.
An ambitious man and badly advised by his relatives and friends, his government was characterized by continuous difficulties with the natives and the vecinos of Concepcion. In the Parliament of Boroa (1651) he reached a peace accord with the indigenous peoples that was broken within two years. 
The followers of the Governor went into Mapuche territory with the aim to profit from the war. The failure of the successive expeditions and the indigenous revolt of 1655, motivated the vecinos of Concepcion to declare the deposition of Acuña to the shouts of ” The king lives! The bad governor dies!”, an action that was not accepted by the Cabildo of Santiago, the Audiencia and the Junta de Guerra, that reestablished Acuña in control. 
Given these circumstances, the Viceroy of Peru sent for him to appear before him. Acuña did not accept the order. A new governor Pedro Porter Casanate, was appointed, and his first mission was to force the return of Acuña to Lima, where he would die shortly afterward.

Get Britain Out

Get Britain Out (formerly The Anti-Common Market League (ACML)) is a British Eurosceptic organisation.
The group was set up in 1961 in response to the failed attempt by Britain to enter the European Economic Community the previous year. Led by John Paul and Michael Shay, the group was initially restricted to Conservative Party members. Its President Victor Montagu courted controversy when he claimed that the British did not want to be led by "a bunch of frogs and huns", although the ACML soon distanced itself from xenophobia, whilst also opening membership to anyone regardless of their political party affiliation.
Under the chairmanship of Sir Robin Williams (1969 to 1984) the group became a constituent member of the National Referendum Campaign, an umbrella movement associated with "The Spectator" that included such disparate groups as the British League of Rights, Ron Leighton's Get Britain Out, the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru and the United Ulster Unionist Party as well as leading politicians such as Barbara Castle, Michael Foot and Enoch Powell. Following the demise of this broad coalition the ACML continued to operate, being particularly vocal in its criticism of the Common Agricultural Policy and moves towards devolution, whilst campaigning for free trade with the world as a whole rather than just the European Union. Under the chairmanship of Peter Dul and Presidency of Richard Body the group has worked closely with the Anti-Maastricht Alliance and the Campaign for an Independent Britain The ACML is now affiliated to the latter organisation and appoints two members to its National Committee.

1990 Dushanbe riots

The 1990 Dushanbe riots were an instance of anti-Armenian and anti-government unrest in Dushanbe, the capital of the Tajik SSR, from February 12–14, 1990.
History.
In 1988, in the aftermath of the Sumgait pogrom and anti-Armenian riots in the Azerbaijan SSR, 39 Armenian refugees were temporarily resettled from Azerbaijan to Dushanbe. In 1990, the Armenian influx became a subject of the rumour that triggered riots in Dushanbe. The rumour inflated the number of refugees to 2,500–5,000. According to rumour Armenians allegedly were being resettled in new housing in Dushanbe experiencing acute housing shortage at that time. Despite the fact that Armenian refugees resettled not in public housing but with their relatives, and by 1990 already left Tajikistan for Armenia, official denouncement of the rumours was not able to stop the protests. Assurances by Communist Party First Secretary Ghagar Makhkamov that no resettlement of Armenians was taking place were rejected by the demonstrators.
Soon, demonstrations sponsored by the nationalist Rastokhez movement turned violent. Radical economical and political reforms were demanded by the protesters. Government buildings, shops and other businesses were attacked and looted. Armenians, Russians, and other ethnic minorities were targeted. Abuse of Tajik women wearing European clothes in public also took place. The riots were put down by Soviet troops that were called into Dushanbe by Ghagar Makhkamov. However Makhamov's over reliance on military force was criticized by Buri Karimov, a deputy chair of Council of Ministers, who called for the resignation of the leadership of the Tajik Communist Party. On February 14, 1990 Makhamov and Prime Minister of Tajik SSR Ezatolloh Khayeyev submitted their resignations, but they were not accepted by the Central Committee of the Tajik Communist Party.
During the Dushanbe riots, a period lasting a couple of days, 22 people were killed and 565 were injured. Among the Tajik youth activists convicted for participation in the riots was a future minister of the interior of Tajikistan Yakub Salimov.
Smaller scale anti-Armenian incidents were also recorded in another Soviet Central Asian Republic, the Turkmen SSR.

Project Oilsand

Project Oilsand, also known as Project Oilsands, and originally known as Project Cauldron, was a 1958 proposal to exploit the Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta via the underground detonation of up to 100 nuclear explosives; hypothetically, the heat and pressure created by an underground detonation would boil the bitumen deposits, reducing their viscosity to the point that standard oilfield techniques could be used.
Project Cauldron was suggested by L.M. Natland, a geologist working for Richfield Oil, in response to American efforts to find peaceful uses for atomic energy. An investigative committee was formed with the support of Alberta's Social Credit government. One of the committee's early recommendations was that, in order to minimize public fears, a "less effervescent name" should be used; Project Cauldron was subsequently renamed Project Oilsand.
In April 1959, the Federal Mines Department approved Project Oilsand; Pony Creek, Alberta (64 miles from Fort McMurray) was selected as a test site. Before the project could continue beyond these preliminary steps, however, the Canadian government's stance on the use of nuclear weapons shifted towards one of non-proliferation; out of concerns that it would increase the risk of Soviet espionage, Project Oilsand was put on hiatus. In April 1962, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Howard Charles Green said "Canada is opposed to nuclear tests, period"; Project Oilsand was subsequently canceled.

Walker v. Armco Steel Corp.

Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U.S. 740 (1980), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court further refined the test for determining whether federal courts sitting in diversity must apply state law as opposed to federal law. The question in Walker is whether in a diversity action the federal court should follow state law or, alternatively, Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in determining when an action is commenced for the purpose of tolling the state statute of limitations (SOL). The Court found no such conflict because a court’s refusal to apply the federal rule at issue would not in fact thwart some purpose the federal rule was intended to achieve. Favored treatment for federal procedural rules under the Rules Enabling Act is only appropriate when a rule is in fact applicable.
Background information.
The case dealt with a negligence claim brought by an Oklahoma plaintiff in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the defendant, a foreign corporation having its principal place of business in a state other than Oklahoma. Plaintiff was injured August 22, 1975. The complaint was filed on August 19, 1977, and the summons was issued that day. However, service of process was not made on the respondent until December 1, 1977. On January 5, 1978, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that it was barred by the applicable Oklahoma Statute of Limitations. Though the action was filed within the two-year SOL, the action is only deemed commenced when the service of the summons is made on the respondent, which in this case occurred after the SOL. Okla. Stat., Tit. 12 § 95 (1971) does not deem the action "commenced" for the purposes of the statute of limitations until service of the summons on the defendant. However, if the complaint is filed within the limitations period, the action is deemed to have commenced from the date of filing if the plaintiff serves the defendant within 60 days, even though that service may occur outside the limitations period. 
The District Court dismissed the complaint as being barred by the statute of limitations under the state law of Oklahoma on the grounds that state law applied. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.
Court's decision.
The Supreme Court affirmed the decision, holding that the action was barred by the Oklahoma statute of limitations because the scope of Rule 3 was not sufficiently broad to control the issue before the District Court. There was no indication that the Rule was intended to toll a state statute of limitations, much less that it purported to displace state tolling rules for purposes of state statutes of limitations. In diversity actions, Rule 3 governs the date from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules begin to run, but does not affect state statutes of limitations.
In contrast to Rule 3, the Oklahoma statute is a statement of a substantive decision by that State that actual service on, and accordingly actual notice to, the defendant is an integral part of the policies. The establishment of a deadline gives the defendant legitimate peace of mind, and recognizes that after a certain period of time, it is unfair to require the defendant to piece together his defense to an old claim. Rule 3 does not replace such policy determinations found in state law, and that Rule and § 97 can exist side by side, each controlling its own intended sphere of coverage without conflict. The analysis regarding whether state or federal procedural law applies is not applicable because there is no direct conflict. In this case, both the applicable federal and state rules, Rule 3 and Okla. Stat., Tit. 12 § 97 (1971), "can exist side by side...each controlling its own intended sphere of coverage without conflict."

Papyrus 22

Papyrus 22 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by 𝔓22, is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Gospel of John, it contains only John 15:25-16:2.21-32. The manuscript paleographically had been assigned to the early 3rd century. 
Description.
It was written in two consecutive columns of all roll. The reverse side is blank. The nomina sacra abbreviated. No punctuation marks. 
The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type (rather proto-Alexandrian). Aland described it as a normal text and placed it in Category I. This manuscript displays an independent text. Coincidences with the Codex Sinaiticus are frequent, but divergences are noticeable. There are no singular readings. According to Schofield the fragment rather represents the eclecticism of the early papyri before the crystallizing of the textual families had taken place.
It was digitized by the CSNTM in 2008.
It is currently housed at the Glasgow University Library (MS Gen 1026) in Glasgow.

Albrecht v. Herald Co.

Albrecht v. Herald Co., , was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that wholesalers could not require franchisees and retailers of their products to sell items at a certain price; advertisements regarding sales, therefore, always included the language "Available at participating retailers only". This broad rule was reversed in 1997 by "State Oil Co. v. Khan", which held that such price-setting was not inherently anti-competitive and not a violation of antitrust law.
"Albrecht" drew heavy criticism by economists, because vertical price fixing, particularly in the newspaper industry, actually increases consumer welfare, which is considered to be a primary goal of antitrust.
Facts.
Lester J. Albrecht, an independent newspaper carrier, bought from Herald Publishing Company at wholesale and sold at retail copies of Herald's morning newspaper, the "St. Louis Globe-Democrat", under an exclusive territory arrangement terminable if a carrier exceeded the maximum retail price advertised by Albrecht. When Albrecht exceeded that price, Herald Co. protested to him and then informed Albrecht's subscribers that it would itself deliver the paper at the lower price. Herald Co. engaged an agency (Milne) to solicit petitioner's customers. About 300 of Albrecht's 1200 subscribers switched to direct delivery by Herald.
Herald Co. later turned these customers over, without cost, to another carrier (Kroner), who was aware of Herald's purpose and knew that he might have to return the route if Albrecht discontinued his pricing practice. Herald Co. told Albrecht that he could have his customers back if he adhered to the suggested price. Albrecht filed a treble-damage complaint which, as later amended, charged a combination in restraint of trade in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, between Herald, Albrecht's customers, Milne, and Kroner. Albrecht's appointment as carrier was terminated and Herald sold his route.
Judgment.
The Supreme Court held that Albrecht acted unlawfully by requiring retailers to sell newspapers at a particular price.
Economic background.
A newspaper's profits are determined by its circulation formula_1 and the number of advertisements formula_2 it sells. Like in every circulation industry, circulation depends upon the price of a copy, as well as the amount of advertising: formula_3. Similarly, the demand for advertising space is determined by formula_4. In other words: the higher the circulation, the higher the demand for advertising space. The profit-maxizing newspaper monopolist therefore sets his copy price as:
formula_5
where formula_6 is the cost per copy, formula_7 is the marginal cost of advertisement, formula_8 is the traditional price elasticity of demand, and formula_9 captures the feedback effect of lower copy prices inducing more advertising and vice versa. Most important is the term formula_10, which captures the marginal advertising profit from selling additional advertising due to increased circulation. The newspaper monopolist's optimal price is therefore "lower" than for traditional monopolists in non-circulation industries.

MTV Czech Republic is a 24 hour music and entertainment television channel which serves the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
The channel launched on 29 November 2009 under a licensing agreement between MTV Networks Europe, a subsidiary of MTV Networks, owned by the current Viacom from its split of the old Viacom in 2005 and CME, the owner of TV Nova.
The channel features local advertising and sponsorship opportunities, along with subtitled or dubbed programming in the Czech language. The channel uses a similar on-air identity as other MTV channels in Europe and around the world, although it also produces some idents and graphics of its own and has won several awards. It is also one of the few widescreen MTV channels in the world.
MTV Czech broadcasts weekly on average over 100 hours of pure music content, including various blocks, making it the only MTV channel in the world to do so, alongside MTV Adria. The most music on MTV Czech is played on Saturday's, from noon (12:05 PM) till Sunday morning (09:35 AM). That is 21 hours straight of pure music content, which basically respects and reflects the original concept of MTV - a 24-hour TV channel dedicated only to music.
MTV Czech mostly plays current music videos or videos from the past few years, although occasionally it airs older videos from the early 2000s and mid to late 1990s. The oldest music videos to air on the network are "Imagine" by John Lennon and "Like A Virgin" by Madonna. Unlike most of the other music channels from MTV Networks around the world, MTV Czech usually plays music videos uncut and in full length.

List of colossal sculpture in situ

This is a list of colossal sculptures that were carved "in situ" (or "in place"), sometimes referred to as "living rock". This list includes two colossal stones that were intended to be moved; however they were never broken free of the quarry in which they were carved and therefore they would be considered carved in situ. Most of these were carved in ancient times.
In most cases, especially in India, the sculptures were carved out of "soft" rock like basalt or volcanic tuff. However in some cases they were carved out of harder rock like sandstone, or even granite in the case of the unfinished obelisk. The Egyptians may have been limited to using 10 pound dolerite balls to chip away at the granite. Dynamite was used in the carving of Mount Rushmore, another of the few colossal sculptures that was carved out of granite.

"Not to be confused with the Ashcombe House in Wiltshire occupied by Madonna and Guy Ritchie."
Ashcombe House at Swainswick, north-east of Bath in Somerset, England is a Gothic revival country house. It is a Grade II listed building.
Ashcombe House stands on the slopes of the Lam Valley in of grounds. It dates from the early nineteenth century, and was altered in the late nineteenth century. It started life as a hunting lodge, and there are the remains of the former kennels in the grounds. The 1900 1:10,560 scale (6 inch) Ordnance Survey map shows the building was known at that time as Ashcombe Farm, with Ashcombe Wood lying to the north-east of it. The house has a rear wing constructed from a converted coach house and stables, and has nine bedrooms and six reception rooms, including a Georgian ballroom. The house was on the market in 2003 for £1.6 million. 
Ashcombe House is the family home of Barbara and Michael James. Musician Peter Gabriel rented the property between 1978 and 1987 as his family home and converted the house's barn into his home studio, where he recorded three of his albums: his 1982 album "Peter Gabriel", commonly known as "4" (or as "Security" in the US); the soundtrack for the film "Birdy", which he recorded between October and December 1984; and his album "So", recorded in 1985 and released in 1986. The track "My Secret Place" from the Joni Mitchell album "Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm" was also recorded at Gabriel's studios at Ashcombe House in 1986.

<doc id="19906464" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19906464" title="Nonmarket forces">
Nonmarket forces

In economics, nonmarket forces are those acting on economic actors from outside the market system. They include internal and external organizing and correcting factors that provide order to market and other types of societal institutions and organizations – economic, political, social and cultural – so that they may function efficiently and effectively as well as repair their failures.
Uses, rationales and applications.
Nonmarket (or non-market) forces are increasingly discussed in the literature of business, management, organization, strategy, social-issues, political-science and sociology.
First uses.
The term has been employed since at least the late 1940s. A.O. Hirschman defined “exit and voice as market and nonmarket forces, that is, economic and political mechanisms” in 1970, quoting a 1963 article by Kenneth Arrow which referred to “nonmarket social institutions.”
Frequent association with government.
In the business, management, economic and political-science literatures, nonmarket is overwhelmingly associated with government, compared to other non-economic institutions, as in economist Baron’s (1995: 47) often quoted definition in the strategic-management field:
"The nonmarket environment includes the social, political, and legal arrangements that structure interactions outside of, but in conjunction with, markets and private agreements. The nonmarket environment encompasses those interactions between the firm and individuals, interest groups, government entities, and the public that are intermediated not by markets but by public and private institutions. Public institutions differ from markets because of characteristics such as majority rule, due process, broad enfranchisement, collective action, and publicness. Activities in the nonmarket environment may be voluntary, as when the firm cooperates with government officials, or involuntary, such as when government regulates an activity or an activist group organizes a boycott of a firm’s product."
However, other researchers have related nonmarket to the equally important societal institutions of community and culture as well as to command economies, traditional exchange and non-profit organizations (see below).
"Nonmarket" as the antonym of "market".
Nonmarket as well as its antecedents “non-economic” and “social” reflects the long search for a term that would encompass what is “"not" market” after this economic institution had become the dominant exchange mechanism in modern capitalist economies. “Market” itself is a complex concept which Boyer (1997: 62-66) variously categorized as: 
The following definition of market is adapted from Hollingsworth, Schmitter and Streeck (1994: 5) and is related to Boyer’s fourth and fifth meanings of "market": 
"Markets are arenas in which individual or corporate actors holding separate property rights in different resources voluntarily engage in free, legally enforceable contractual buying and selling exchanges, with prices providing information for the allocation of goods and services."
Association with a capitalist economic system.
Most definitions and uses of “nonmarket” and “market” assume a capitalistic economic system characterized by private property in the means of production and where markets provide a social space for voluntary contracts and competitive rivalry (Hollingsworth et al., 1994: 3). Economic markets tend to be very proprietary in that the costs and benefits of exchanges are more closely restricted to the parties directly involved in them – that is, people by and large get only what they pay for, and they pay for what they get – while nonmarket exchange arenas – political, social and cultural – are characterized by much greater spillovers and weaker links between costs and benefits so that a wider universe of parties other than those directly involved in exchanges bear costs and enjoy benefits (Hayes, 1981: 133; Tollison, 1982: 85-89).
Other applications of "nonmarket".
Besides its reference to markets and firms in a capitalist economic system, nonmarket has also been applied to:
Underlying societal transformations.
Most modern societies chose to separate what came to be called the "economy" from other subsystems, and they adopted a “market” way of running it. What would later be labeled the nonmarket referred to other macro institutions (i.e., the state, community and culture), their organizations and actors that interchange and often conflict with interdependent market ones. Particularly since the publication of "The Great Transformation" (Polanyi, 1944), the concepts of “non-economic,” “social” and “nonmarket” successively emerged to refer to the internal and external factors that assist markets, firms and other types of institutions and organizations to function efficiently and effectively as well as repair their failures. Boddewyn (2003) interpreted them as “four perspectives on nonmarket” which the following sections analyze in terms of:
Four conceptual perspectives on nonmarket.
Nonmarket at the societal level.
For political economists (e.g., Baron, 1995; Kindleberger, 1969), social-systems theorists (e.g., Parsons & Smelser, 1956) and some political scientists (e.g., Hirschman, 1970), society is made up of subsystems – economic, political, social and cultural – each one with its own institutions and organizations. In modern capitalist societies, the economic subsystem is mainly enacted through market institutions and organizations (firms). In this context, nonmarket refers to exogenous non-economic subsystems, institutions and organizations – political, social and cultural – and to their distinct functioning and interacting with market ones – including the issue of which one predominates over the others through both market and nonmarket modes of exchange (money, power, inclusion/exclusion, trust, zeal, moral commitment, etc.). At both extremes of this relationship, one has either an overly constrained market system dominated by other societal institutions or a “market society” ruled by market actors, values and processes. Both extremes represent failures of effective integration between market and nonmarket societal subsystems.
Nonmarket at the firm level.
Micro-economists (e.g., Milgrom & Roberts, 1992) interpret nonmarket to refer to institutions that are “not market in nature” – that is, not related to the pursuit of efficiency through complete information, unbounded rationality in relating ends and means, cost-benefit tradeoffs in choosing solutions, material incentives (e.g., prices reflecting supply and demand) used to reconcile divergent personal interests, and competition among actors pursuing such interests. This pursuit of efficiency depends on the existence of such institutions as private property and free contracting but, once the market system is set in motion by society, it operates autonomously in isolation from other societal subsystems. In micro-economic analyses, nonmarket factors either amount to “givens” (e.g., property laws), are treated as “allocationally neutral” because applying to all firms in a particular industry (e.g., corporate tax rates) or are ignored because “nontradeable” (e.g., reputation). Failure results from the lack of perfect competition in markets.
Nonmarket at the organizational level.
In reaction to this “economic-science imperialism” (Buckley & Casson, 1993), other social sciences identified and promoted political, social and cultural (including moral and ethical) factors as necessary complements to economic ones. Their inclusion would help achieve individual and organizational effectiveness in exchanges through personalized relations, internalized rules, norms and customs. For sociologists (e.g., Granovetter, 1985, 1992), nonmarket refers to endogenized social, political and cultural factors that permeate economic exchanges and are often necessary to achieve individual, organizational and interorganizational effectiveness which is not possible when economic action is “under-socialized.” Such factors allow many exchanges to take place even when pricing is difficult, money is inappropriate, markets are not available, property rights are unclear and insecure, and the pursuit of self-interest is insufficient to guarantee orderly transactions free of malfeasance and opportunism. In other words, many micro-economic exchanges are not purely dyadic, rational, self-interested and impersonal since cooperation is common among exchanging parties who frequently conform to rules, norms and customs, thereby developing a “socialized rationality” on account of “the social embeddedness of economic action.” Besides, firm actors have the moral obligation to consider the “appropriateness” of their actions. Failure is related to "under-socialized" behavior (e.g., "free-riding"), but also to the use of “over-socialized” collusion and fraud (e.g., the Mafia).
Nonmarket as corrective mechanisms.
For political scientists (e.g., Hirschman, 1970), nonmarket refers to the power-based correctives – mainly, political “voice” – used to improve all organizations – economic, political, social and cultural – when competition among them fails to repair their decline or decay. That is, under any economic, political, social or cultural system, all individuals and organizations are permanently subject to lapses from efficient, rational, law-abiding, virtuous or otherwise functional behavior. Society’s welfare is optimized only when all organizations – those of the market, state, civil society and culture – compete among themselves although inefficient or ineffective organizations may remain insensitive to competition because they can tap other resources (organizational slack, public funding, reciprocity, nationalistic preferences, etc.) to survive even in the face of decline. If competition does not lead to the “exit” of inefficient or ineffective organizations, then political “voice” (petitioning, mobilizing opinion, protesting, etc.) is needed to change objectionable states of affairs. As such, nonmarket is related to the use of power (including force), with actors using their property and sovereignty rights to exert influence over others who deploy the same rights to resist such attempts. Market “exit” as well as nonmarket “voice” and "loyalty" are used by all organizations, and repair is enactable through these mechanisms even though institutional failure remains a constant occurrence through time and place.
General definition.
Based on these four partial definitions, Boddewyn (2003) proposed the following general one:
Nonmarket refers to internal and external organizing and correcting factors that provide order to market and other types of societal institutions and organizations – economic, political, social and cultural – so that they may function efficiently and effectively as well as repair their failures.

Tectonic phase

A tectonic phase or deformation phase is in structural geology and petrology a phase in which tectonic movement or metamorphism took place. Tectonic phases can be extensional or compressional in nature.
When numerous subsequent compressional tectonic phases share the same geodynamic cause (usually some plate tectonic mechanism) this is called an orogeny. During an orogeny tectonic phases lead to mountain building, which causes deformation and metamorphism of rocks. In most Phanerozoic orogenies many tectonic phases are distinguished.
Tectonic phases in basin geology and sedimentary rocks.
According to Steno's principle of original horizontality, sedimentary rocks are normally deposited as horizontal layers. When tectonic movement occurs sedimentary layers can be tilted. under such circumstances, the sedimentary planes will have a dip (an angle with a horizontal reference plane). When new sedimentary layers are deposited on top of tilted ones, they will have an angle with the older ones, a structure which is called an angular unconformity. Any angular unconformity is prove that a tectonic phase took place between the deposition of the layers below and on top of it.
It is important to know if the tectonic phase was a longer event or if it was local or regional. Tectonic phases can be important events that affected large areas. The Alleghenian orogeny in North America (during the Carboniferous period) for example can be found as an angular unconformity between rock layers in large parts of that continent.
When a tectonic phase occurred while sedimentation of new sediments continued, every new layer will have a slightly different dip from the one below. The result is a sequence of sediments that wedges out in one direction. This is usually the case on the margins of geologic basins.
Tectonic phases in metamorphic rocks.
In petrology, metamorphic phases can be distinguished by analysis of minerals and microstructures (petrography) in metamorphic rocks. By analysing the sequence in which the minerals and structures were formed, more than one phase can be found in most metamorphic rocks (this is called polymetamorphism). By radiometric dating the absolute age of the different phases of mineral growth can be determined, showing when the rock was under certain pressure-temperature conditions. The obtained age is not necessarily the age of a tectonic phase, but can show when the tectonic phase ended and crystallisation of new minerals occurred.

Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists

The Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists (AOJS) is an organization of scientists that focuses on the interrelationships between science and Halakha.
The organization was established at a meeting held on December 28, 1947, with a focus on five goals: 
The organization reached nearly 2,000 dues-paying members in the early 1960s. "Time" magazine reported that the organization had over 1,000 members by the late 1960s.
AOJS is still active and recently celebrated its 49th Annual Summer Convention, with the theme "A Torah-Informed Evaluation of Darwin's Theory of Evolution"
The AOJS Medical-Dental section maintains a list of Shomer Shabbos Medical residency positions available around the U.S.
The Mission of AOJS.
The Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists is an organization devoted to the orientation of science within the framework of Orthodox Jewish tradition. The organization aims to assist those endeavors which will help improve the Torah way of life for Jews throughout the modern world, both intellectually and practically.
Founded in 1948, AOJS serves the Jewish community in areas to which the Orthodox scientist is particularly qualified to contribute. The Association also provides an intellectual meeting ground for persons who, by virtue of their professional qualifications, interests and activities, can contribute to the constructive incorporation of scientific knowledge and thinking into the Torah way of life. It unites the common interests of Orthodox Jewish scientists throughout the world.
The specific aims of the Association include:
Education and Guidance
Assistance to individuals and institutions in the solution of practical problems encountered by Orthodox Jews and their children in the study or practice of scientific pursuits; support for the educational ideal of a true synthesis of Jewish and secular studies.
Ideology
Study of the applicability of scientific method and knowledge to the strengthening of Torah ideology; contribution to the solution of ideological problems relating to the apparent points of conflict between scientific theory and Orthodox Judaism.
Halacha
Provision of consulting services to Rabbinical authorities concerned with the implications of technological developments for the Jewish law.
AOJS continues its work, which includes, planning major events which attract numerous participants, responding to individual inquiries on issues of practical halacha related to science and medicine and publishing articles and essays related to science and medicine, allowing them to successfully reach the Jewish community. In the end, though, the heart of AOJS is not the schedule or the programs, it is the thinkers, like you, who are committed to exploring contemporary scientific developments and dilemmas from a halachic perspective.
The History of AOJS.
There was a time, not very long ago, that the very notion of an Orthodox Jewish Scientist was considered an anomaly on the Jewish scene. In the 1940's, despite general shock over the Holocaust, some of the most prestigious universities still had formal or informal quotas limiting the number of Jews, and exams were often held on Shabbat and Jewish holidays. As a result, Orthodox Jewish science students constituted only about one in 1,000 Jewish university students in the U.S. Today, the religiously observant doctor, physicist, computer programmer, engineer, and psychologist are commonplace. Often called upon by the rav, or Torah authority, to explain the scientific principles that will guide him in his halachic decision making, the Orthodox Jewish Scientist has become an integral part of Orthodox Judaism observance in the ever-changing modern world. Rabbis faced with the need to apply the halacha to a rapidly changing technological world find it easier to communicate their needs to Torah scholars who are equally well versed in the sciences. The Orthodox Jewish Scientist has indeed come a long way in the synthesis of Torah and science. 
On December 28, 1947, a group of scientists, most of them graduate students in the natural sciences, sat down at the first meeting of AOJS. The founding group set down five goals: to clarify the bond between science and the Torah; to apply Torah principles in solving specific problems; to further themselves professionally and socially by associating with others who had common interests; to advise religious students interested in science; and to train in areas of science needed in Israel. The organization reached its peak in the early 1960's when they had nearly 2,000 dues-paying members. 
Since its inception in 1947, the Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists (AOJS) has been at the forefront of addressing the interface of science and halacha. Initially, AOJS served as a safe haven and social outlet for a few frum physicists and chemists to share their ideas, and as an agency to resolve apparent conflicts between scientific findings and Torah beliefs. It also became the address for those seeking halachic guidance in areas where halacha and science interfaced. 
In the 1960's, AOJS expanded its domain to service those in the medical, nursing, computer psychological and social sciences. It was also during this period that AOJS became involved in social activism. It would decry, raise public awareness, and create and/or assist agencies working in the areas of spousal, child and drug abuse in the Orthodox community. It was also active in seeking the release of Jewish scientists from the USSR. 
The AOJS is presently divided into three major sections: physical & computer sciences, medical & life sciences, and behavioral sciences. The Orthodox Jewish scientist working through the AOJS, has become a major source of reliable scientific information for the Torah community all over the world, and is recognized as having made important contributions in very practical ways to the development of the halacha. 
From the perspective of Jewish law and theology, AOJS provides a forum for research, innovation and discussion of these increasingly difficult areas. AOJS, as well, has created an open forum in which scientists can consult, network and concur with fellow professionals in their discipline. There are, to date, over 2000 members and friends of the AOJS, worldwide - including professionals (doctors, psychologists, research scientists, etc.), academicians, rabbis, students and informed lay people. 
AOJS has hosted hundreds of conventions, conferences, symposiums and lecture series' that have broadly focused on these subjects. Thousands of articles have been published and circulated to the Orthodox Jewish public pertaining to the science/halacha interface. Books have been published, scientific advances have been made, difficult areas in halacha have been clarified. All this…is AOJS.
Original Letter of Invitation to the Formation of AOJS.
December 17, 1947
A number of us have concluded that the time is ripe - especially in view of the imminence of a Jewish State - to form an organization of scientists who have a traditional Jewish point of view. By such an association we hope to strengthen the fourfold bond between ourselves, science, Jewish tradition, and the Jewish nation.
Certain suggestions along which the group may proceed have been noted as follows:
-By means of lectures and mutual interchange of ideas to clarify the bond between science and Jewish traditions including specific problems in halacha.
-By mutual aid to simplify difficulties in upholding Shabbos in universities and industries.
-To assist Orthodox youth to specialize in science.
-To obtain information on scientific endeavor in Eretz Israel and on how we can be of assistance there.
You can help put these ideas plus any others that you may have into concrete shape by coming to the first meeting of the group. This will take place, IY"H:
Sunday, December 28, 1947…7:30 P.M.
In the home of
ELMER OFFENBACHER
181 E. 93rd Street, New York, N.Y.
Kindly spread this information to your friends who may have an interest in this group and invite them along.
We think you will enjoy the Chavershaft in a group that will have the greatest known density of Orthodox Jewish scientists.

Urban Ministries

Urban Ministries, Inc. (UMI) is an independent, African American-owned and operated Christian media company founded in 1970.
UMI publishes Christian resources, including Sunday School and Vacation Bible School curricula, books, movies, and websites designed for African American churches and others seeking a diverse perspective on faith and life issues.
Since its founding, UMI has served over 40,000 churches across the United States, the Caribbean, and Africa. It is evangelical in its theology but rooted in the African American church tradition.
Founding and history.
The establishment of Urban Ministries, Inc. was the fulfillment of a boyhood dream that Melvin E. Banks had at the age of 12. Soon after becoming a Christian, Banks gave his testimony on one of the back roads of Birmingham, Alabama. An old, white-haired Black man heard his testimony and quoted this Scripture verse to him: "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge" (Hosea 4:6). This verse made a great impression on Banks, and he determined to devote his life to educating African Americans with knowledge of the Bible and Christian teaching.
While working at the predominantly white evangelical Christian publishing company Scripture Press, Banks realized the need for resources that would appeal to African Americans. In 1970, a Board of Directors was selected and Banks’s boyhood dream began to take shape with the incorporation of Urban Ministries. During its first 12 years, UMI operated out of the basement of the Banks family’s home. In the spring of 1996, UMI completed construction and took occupancy of a new headquarters facility located in Calumet City, Illinois, in South Suburban Chicago.
UMI today.
Today, UMI is one of the few independent African American-owned and operated religious publishers producing materials specifically for African American churches. UMI materials include Sunday School curriculum, Vacation Bible School resources, books, videos, and music, all of which depict or speak to people of color in the context of their culture.
Melvin Banks remains with the company as founder and chairman, and Carl Jeffrey Wright serves as Chief Executive Officer and Terence Chatmon serves as President.

<doc id="19906671" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19906671" title="Spanish opera">
Spanish opera

Spanish opera is both the art of opera in Spain and opera in the Spanish language. Opera has existed in Spain since the mid 17th century. 
Early history.
Opera was slow to develop within Spain in comparison to France, Italy, and to a lesser extent Germany which have had continuous traditions of opera since the early part of the 17th century. One of the reasons for this slow development was the existence of a strong tradition of spoken drama in Spain which made some critics believe that opera was a less worthy artform. However, there was a tradition of songs given within largely spoken plays which began in the early 16th century by such distinguished composers as Juan del Encina. 
The earliest Spanish operas appeared in the mid 17th century with libretti by such famous writers as Calderón de la Barca and Lope de Vega to music by such composers as Juan Hidalgo de Polanco. These early operas, however, failed to catch the imagination of the Spanish public. It was not until the increasing popularity of such genres as ballad opera and opéra comique that opera in Spain started to gain momentum, since the use of speech in the vernacular inevitably encouraged Spanish composers to develop their own national style of opera: zarzuela.
Zarzuela.
Zarzuela is characterized by a mixture of sung and spoken dialogue. Although Hidalgo's early forays into opera were more along the lines of Italian opera, he was instrumental in helping to create the art form, composing the first known zarzuela, "El laurel de Apolo", in 1657. The courtly Baroque zarzuela, a mixture of sophisticated verse drama, allegorical opera, popular song, and dance, became the fashion of the Spanish court for over the next 100 years. 
The opera artform flourished in Spain during the eighteenth century with two excellent composers, Sebastián Durón and Antonio Literes. Literes' opera "Accis y Galatea" (1708) was particularly popular. Also of note later in the century was Rodrígues de Hita (c.1724–87) who used guitars, mandolins, tambourines, and castanets and incorporated spectacular dancing into his opera "Las labradoras de Murcia" (1769). The zarzuela (in this sense) was eventually superseded by a yet simpler entertainment, the "tonadilla escénica" (usually a down-to-earth story of everyday folk), but this too became increasingly sophisticated. Eventually the popularity of zarzuela waned at the end of the 18th century, with the last known zarzuela of the century, "Clementina" by Luigi Boccherini, premiering in 1786. For over the next sixty years Italian opera became the predominantly popular form of opera in Spain.
In the mid 19th century there was a renewed interest in the zarzuela in Spain, just as in other countries an increasing national awareness gave rise to distinctive styles to combat the pervading influence of Italian opera. It has been estimated that over 10,000 zarzuelas were written in the hundred years after 1850. The Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid became the hub of activity, but scores of companies in the capital, the provinces, and Spanish-speaking Central and South America were busily performing zarzuela in repertory. 
Of particular note is composer Francisco Asenjo Barbieri who aimed to create a distinctively national operatic style which fused the traditional tonadilla and the old, aristocratic drama into a new form evolved from Italian comic opera. In contrast, Emilio Arrieta stayed closer to ‘pure’ Romantic Italian models in such zarzuelas as "Marina" (1855). The two became intense rivals within the eyes of the public and their competitive behavior made zarzuela extremely popular. 
Other composers, such as Tomás Bretón and Ruperto Chapí, wrote smaller zarzuelas known as "género chico" which were farces in one-act. These farcical operas often contained social or political satire and usually contained less music and more spoken dialogue than other forms of zarzuela. The género chico reached its height of popularity in the 1880s and 1890s with composer Federico Chueca.
In the 20th century the zarzuela evolved with popular taste, though the mixture of spoken play and operatic music in roughly equal proportions remained. Operetta-zarzuelas, most notably by Pablo Luna and Amadeo Vives, coexisted with revue-style farces such as Francisco Alonso's "Las leandras" (1931) and sentimental verismo dramas such as José Serrano's "La dolorosa" (1930). In the 1930s Pablo Sorozábal attempted to restore the satirical thrust of the 1890s, but after the Spanish Civil War the distinctive quality of zarzuela was lost in imitations of the Broadway musical. Since 1960 very few new works have entered the repertory, but the popularity of the classic zarzuelas continues.
Full opera.
Attempts to write a full, through-sung, opera include Manuel de Falla's "Atlàntida" (1962 posth.), Enrique Granados' one-act opera "Goyescas", Tomás Bretón's "La Dolores", and the English-language operas of Isaac Albéniz - "Merlin", "Henry Clifford" and "Pepita Jiménez" for London and the Gran Teatro del Liceo.
Manuel Garcia's Italian-language operas "L'amante astuto" ("The astute lover") and "La figlia dell' aria" ("The daughter of the air") had been performed in New York during the 19th Century but Spanish opera waited till the 20th Century. In the Americas operas include Alberto Ginastera's "Bomarzo," (New York 1967) and Mexican composer Daniel Catán's "Florencia en el Amazonas" (Houston 1996).

Biff Brewster

Biff Brewster is the central character in a series of 13 adventure and mystery novels for adolescent boys written by Andy Adams. The series was published by Grosset & Dunlap between 1960 and 1965.
Most titles were published in hardcover with full color dustjackets, but, like other Grosset & Dunlap juvenile series of the era, production costs were cut by dispensing with the dust jackets and featuring full color cover illustrations in their stead. This occurred only with the last three books in the series, and later reprints of the first three.
The series follows Bruce "Biff" Brewster, a well-built, athletic sixteen-year-old who pursues adventure and mystery abroad with his father, Thomas Brewster, a former lieutenant in the United States Navy and, in the series, chief field engineer for the Ajax Mining Company. The series is distinguished for drawing on foreign cultures and exotic locations as backgrounds. The series was published in Norwegian and British editions.

Sumant Misra

Sumant Misra (11 January 1923 – 3 September 2011) was an Indian tennis player.
Misra, who was born in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh, played on the India Davis Cup team for nine years between 1947 and 1956 and captained the team in 1952 and 1953. He reached the quarter-finals of the Wimbledon Men’s Doubles Championship (along with Jimmy Mehta) in 1947 and 1948 and the US National Doubles at Forest Hills in 1947, being the only pair in the championships to take a set off Schoder and Kramer the winners, who had won both Wimbledon and the US Nationals at Forest Hills that year.
He won the last All India Tennis Championships in 1944–45 and then went on to win the first newly christened National Lawn Tennis Championships of India that was held at Calcutta South Club in Woodburn Park Road, in 1946–47 beating Man Mohan Lal. In 1952–53 he won the national championships again and was the finalist on three other occasions. In the 1947–48 final he was defeated by Lennart Bergelin of Sweden (in later years better known as Björn Borg’s coach).
In 1972 Sumant Misra’s son Gaurav Misra defeated Ramanathan Krishnan to win the National Lawn Tennis Championships of India held at Calcutta South Club, making them the first father –son to win the national championships.
Sumant Misra also won the men’s singles title at both the Ceylon and Malay Nationals in 1958–59 and 1959 respectively. Since there was no ATP Tour then, each country held their own national events. He was the finalist at the inaugural Asian Tennis Championship in 1949.
His game was dominated by a cannonball serve and a lethal backhand. Nicknamed ‘Tiny’, 89-year-old Sumant Misra carried the moniker like a crown on his 6 feet and 2 inches tall frame. Also called ‘the grandfather of Indian tennis’, Misra was initiated into the game by his father Sir L. P. Misra, then Chief Commissioner of Indian Railways. As a 14-year-old, his favourite turf was the Calcutta South Club. That’s where Misra met his contemporaries, Narendra Nath, Man Mohan Lal and Dilip Bose. However, Misra was the only one to participate in the junior national championship, the national championship and national veteran championship.
He was secretary of the All India Tennis Association (AITA, then known as AILTA) from 1963 to 1966 and on the Committee of Management of ITF (International Tennis Federation) during 1965–67.
Misra died on 3 September 2011. He was 88.
Besides tennis, he was an accomplished player in squash racquets, and in later years a golfer with a handicap of 8. “Then, sports was seen as a hobby,” recalls Misra, who retired from Indian Aluminium as General Coordination Manager over two decades ago. He lived in New Delhi with his wife, Sharda Misra and younger daughter. His elder son Gaurav Misra is a former national tennis champion and is the director of the Columbia University's Dick Savitt Tennis Center tennis in New York City, New York.

Gladys Carrion

Gladys Carrión, Esq. is a nationally-recognized advocate for improving child well-being. As an attorney and leader in government, non-profit organizations, and philanthropic foundations, she has a reputation for pushing the boundaries to develop and implement policies and programs to improve outcomes for poor children and families. She is particularly well known for transforming New York State's juvenile justice, child welfare, and child care systems to improve child well-being in the state's 62 counties.
New York City Administration for Children's Services.
Carrión is among the first officials that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio named to lead his administration. Calling her a "change agent and reformer," he appointed Carrión commissioner of the city's child welfare agency, the Administration for Children's Services (ACS) in December, 2013. “She’s devoted her whole life to our children and she understands from her own life story what it’s like for children to come up in humble circumstances and struggle, and understands how much it is our obligation to protect them all,” said de Blasio.
The ACS commissioner manages a $2.8 billion annual budget and 6,500 employees who supervise children in foster care, provides preventive services and administers juvenile justice.
Carrión said her focus at ACS would be on improving preventive services to protect vulnerable children: “We need to focus on tightening the system so that no child falls through the cracks."
Her first month on the job, Mayor de Blasio asked Carrión to investigate the death and abuse of a four-year-old whose file ACS had closed six months earlier.
New York State Office for Children and Family Services.
Until her appointment by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Carrión served as New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo's commissioner for the Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS). She was appointed by Governor Eliot Spitzer in January, 2007. 
OCFS provides oversight of child well-being in local counties. This includes child abuse prevention, a 24-hour child abuse hotline, child abuse investigations, and protective services; foster care and adoption; and child care. OCFS also manages New York's juvenile justice system and supervises county-based juvenile justice programs. In addition, OCFS supervises the Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped (CBVH) and New York State's response to the needs of Native Americans. OCFS has an annual budget of nearly four billion dollars.
Juvenile Justice.
Commissioner Carrión earned the most recognition for her initiative to transform the juvenile justice system she inherited, from a "custody and control" model with a reputation for using excessive force on children; no oversight and few resources; and an 89 percent recidivism rate, to an evidence-based, trauma-informed, community-centered therapeutic model. This transformation has significantly improved child well-being—while at the same time improving public safety in local counties. The New York State Bar Association in June, 2009, honored Carrión with the Howard A. Levine Award for Excellence in Juvenile Justice and Child Welfare for this initiative. More recently, the National Juvenile Justice Network and Texas Public Policy Foundation singled out New York State for the implementation of Commissioner Carrión's initiatives.
Empty Beds, Wasted Dollars.
In an unprecedented move more common to corporate communications, Carrión supported an innovative strategic communications and advocacy plan Empty Beds, Wasted Dollars to generate and maintain critical leverage for the continuing transformation of juvenile justice despite the formidable opposition of upstate legislators and constantly shifting priorities common to state politics. The Empty Beds, Wasted Dollars campaign generated more than 300 newspaper, magazine, television, radio and online story and op-ed placements and 30 editorials in fewer than three years. In turn, this provided Carrión with the political capital needed for the transformation of child care and child welfare, and the overall improvement of child well-being in New York State.
Family Assessment Response.
Under her leadership, OCFS developed a framework for child well-being in New York State's 62 counties that builds on the pillars of safety and permanency to improve outcomes for children and families. This includes implementing a Family Assessment Response (FAR) in child protection cases that do not include allegations of child abuse. Instead of exercising a traditional law enforcement approach, FAR now supports families involved in child neglect allegations with services and interventions to address their needs.
Child Care.
Additionally, Carrión established an OCFS Division for Child Care Services for the first time, and charged it with moving beyond simply regulating child care, to implementing policies and program to improve child care to enhance children's capacity to succeed in school and later in life.
Bridges to Health (B2H).
She also implemented Bridges to Health (B2H), a Federal Medicaid-waiver program to provide comprehensive family and community support services to medically-fragile children in foster care and their families.
LGBTQ Rights.
For the first time, New York State promulgated policies expanding the umbrella of constitutional and civil rights protections to LGBTQ youth when Carrión wrote and institutionalized agency policy protecting youth in state care.
Early Life, Education, and Early Career.
Carrión was born and raised in the South Bronx. After graduating from Fordham University, she earned a law degree from the New York University School of Law. Upon graduation, Carrión took a job as an attorney at the Bronx Legal Services Corporation, launching what would turn out to be a long and distinguished career as an advocate for poor and working families.
At Bronx Legal Services, she represented residents on issues ranging from housing, welfare, education, to family law. Carrión quickly rose to become managing attorney in the South Bronx, the poorest U.S. Congressional district in the nation.
While at Bronx Legal Services, New York City Mayor Edward Koch named Carrión to the Board of Trustees of the City University of New York (CUNY), the largest urban university system in the United States. He also named her as chair of the New York City Schools Chancellor's Task Force on Latino Educational Opportunities.
Upon his election, New York City Mayor David Dinkins pulled her from the South Bronx to lead the then much-maligned Community Development Agency (CDA). CDA was responsible for the allocation of nearly half-a-billion dollars in federal funds that were supposed to address the human services needs of the city's most vulnerable children and families living in the city's poorest neighborhoods. During Carrión's tenure, she conducted the agency's first neighborhood poverty assessment identifying communities of need. She also for the first-time created a transparent process for directing the allocation of federal funds and established a system of accountability to ensure the quality performance of more than 300 funded community based organizations.
Following her government service, Carrión served as executive director at Family Dynamics, where she developed policies and programs to strengthen families and to help them avoid having their children placed in foster care by the New York City Administration for Children's Services.
After a period as a community development program officer at the Ford Foundation, Carrión was named executive director of Inwood House, one of the oldest programs in the city working to lift children and families out of poverty.
She also served as New York Foundation Board of Directors Chairperson, on the Legal Services of New York Executive Committee, and the Child Welfare Watch Advisory Board.
Before Governor Eliot Spitzer named her commissioner for the Office of Children and Family Services, Carrión was senior vice president for community investment at United Way of New York City.

Eaton, Tennessee

Eaton is an unincorporated community in Gibson County, Tennessee.
Geography.
Eaton is located on the right bank of the Middle Fork of the Forked Deer River, about west of Trenton. Eaton is the site of a post office, which is assigned zip code 38331.
History.
The community was first settled in the 1820s after the Jackson Purchase opened West Tennessee to European-American settlement. It was originally known as Buckner's Bluff after early settler J.W. Buckner, but was renamed Eaton in 1827, after John H. Eaton, United States Senator from Tennessee who later became United States Secretary of War in the administration of President Andrew Jackson. It was incorporated as a municipality in the 1830s, lost its incorporated status at some time thereafter, and was reincorporated again around 1875 to 1880, but later lost its incorporated status again. A post office was first established in Eaton in 1830.
The community's commercial peak was in the 1830s. Before rail connections were established in the region, Eaton was an important shipping point, served by keelboats, flatboats, and occasional small steamboats that navigated on the Forked Deer River.

Põhja-Kõrvemaa Nature Reserve

Põhja-Kõrvemaa Nature Reserve () is a protected area in Harju County, Northern Estonia, some 50 km east of Tallinn. With an area of 130.9 km2, it is the third largest nature reserve in Estonia. Dominated by forests and bogs, it aims to protect rare and endangered species, their habitats, and valuable natural landscapes.
Põhja-Kõrvemaa (meaning North Kõrvemaa) occupies the northern part of Kõrvemaa, which itself forms the northern part of Transitional Estonia, a large forested and sparsely populated area spanning in northeast-southwest direction through Estonia, from Lahemaa through Soomaa to Latvia.
History.
Põhja-Kõrvemaa Nature Reserve was established in the end of 1991, a few months after Estonia regained its independence. Throughout the Soviet Era a large part of the nature reserve's current territory was used by Soviet Army for military training and as such was closed to the public. The proving grounds were established in 1947 and in 1953 expanded to 33 304 ha (333 km2), making it the biggest Soviet military polygon in Estonia. Still, the Soviet Army damaged only about 10% of the proving grounds' territory, leaving the rest intact. Due to unsuitability for agriculture (poor and/or badly drained soils) the whole region has always been very sparsely populated – in the beginning of 1950s the population density was around 1 people per km2 – but still a few hundred people were displaced together with the creation of proving ground.
Põhja-Kõrvemaa nature reserve was formed in the western part of the former Aegviidu polygon, which had been hidden behind the official name of Pavlov Forest District. In the 1990s, Estonian Defence Forces were interested to begin reusing some areas of the former polygon now situated on the nature reserve's territory. However, due to strong opposition by local people and conservationists, the idea was given up. In 2001, Estonian Defence Forces central proving ground was established in the eastern part of the former Soviet military polygon. 
The Valgejõgi River is the natural divide between the current proving ground and the nature reserve.
From 1997 to 2007 the nature reserves official status was landscape protection area. In 2007 it was expanded from 12,890 to 13,086 hectares and official status changed back to nature reserve. Since 2004 it is part of the European Union Natura 2000 network.
Nature.
The landscape in Põhja-Kõrvemaa took shape in the end of the last Ice Age, when the glacier retreated about 12,000 years ago and is as such a typical glacial landscape. It is characterized by ice marginal formations and glaciolacustrine plains, the latter of which are now mostly covered by extensive bogs and, to a much lesser extent, fens. Forests cover about 40% of the nature reserve's territory and man-made open areas only 10%. 
The region is richest in Estonia in ice marginal formations. The most remarkable relief forms of the region are eskers, which form steep-sided ridges of very complex relief that extend to a number of kilometers and are up to 25 m high. Along with eskers there are several kame fields — areas covered with hillocks consisting of sand and gravel. Jussi kame field is the best known in Põhja-Kõrvemaa. 
There are more than 30 lakes in Põhja-Kõrvemaa. Most of the lakes are small, situated either in bogs (Kivijärv, Koitjärv, Venejärv and others) or between kames. Jussi Lakes is a group of 6 lakes (spanning from 2 to 20 hectares in area) situated in the eastern part of the Jussi kame field.
In addition to the lakes, the three biggest bogs (Koitjärve, Kõnnu Suursoo and Võhma bogs), which cover about half of the territory, have developed extensive ridges of small bog ponds, which can be counted in hundreds.
Flora and fauna.
A number of rare or endangered species can be found in Põhja-Kõrvemaa, which is one of the main reasons behind the area's status as a nature reserve. It is home to large predators such as Gray Wolf, Eurasian Lynx and Brown Bear. Small populations of European Mink endured until the beginning of 1990s, but are now disappeared, as in most of Estonia. Protected bird species include Black Stork, Golden Eagle, Capercaillie and Common Crane. 19 species of orchids can be found in Põhja-Kõrvemaa (for example, Goodyera repens and Platanthera bifolia), among other rare plants growing in the area are Pulsatilla patens, Sparganium angustifolium, Isoetes echinospora and Oxytropis sordida (the only place in Estonia where the plant is found).
Recreation.
Põhja-Kõrvemaa is one of the most visited protected area in Estonia. It's due to its proximity to the capital, Tallinn (over 500,000 people or around 40% of Estonian population live in Tallinn and the surrounding Harju County) and its good accessibility - in the north the nature reserve is bordered by the Tallinn-Narva highway (E20) and in the west by Jägala-Aegviidu-Käravete secondary road. The nature reserve itself has also a considerable amount of gravel and dirt roads. Aegviidu, which is located less than 5 km southwest from the nature reserve and is the end point of Elektriraudtee commuter railway line, can be reached in an hour from the center of Tallinn.
There are several hiking trails, the longest being the 36 km long Liiapeksi-Aegviidu trail, which crosses the nature reserve from north to south, and also continues to the north in Lahemaa National Park, which is separated from Põhja-Kõrvemaa by Tallinn-Narva highway. Shorter nature and hiking trails and half a dozen campsites are also available, all managed by the State forest management centre (RMK).
Despite the hiking facilities created in recent years, berry and mushroom picking are still the most popular activities among the visitors.
At summer weekends, up to 700 people visit Põhja-Kõrvemaa daily, most of whom drive from Tallinn.

Abandon (band)

Abandon is an American Christian rock band from San Antonio, Texas. The group has five members: brothers Josh (lead vocals) and Justin Engler (guitar), cousins Stevan (guitar) and Dave Vela (drums), and Bryan Fowler (bass). They signed onto ForeFront Records in late 2007 and released the "Abandon EP" in July 2008. Their first single "Providence" was released to radios in August and has reached No. 7 on "R&R"'s Christian rock charts.
The group's name was inspired by the Bible verse of Matthew 10:38, which reads "And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me."
History.
The group of two brothers, two cousins, and friend (and former bassist) Ryan Reavis, formed as an independent band in the 2002, playing worship music at their church. In 2005 they began to play local concerts and released their first album "Ambush", which was produced by the band and Tavis Wilson. Soon after the release of their second album, "Who You Are" (produced by Kevin Bruchert), Reavis chose to leave the band. Not long afterwards, Bruchert introduced the band to Bryan Fowler after they played at his church. Soon after, Fowler joined the band.
They signed a deal with ForeFront Records in the fall of 2007. The record label's A&R manager Chris York discovered the band by hearing them play at a club next door to where York was at a restaurant with his wife. He says, "I was having dinner at a Mexican restaurant with my wife, and she started to get frustrated with me because she could tell I wasn’t paying full attention to our conversation. This was because I could hear a band playing live at the club next door, and it sounded really, really good. I got in touch with the band later, and after we got to know each other, we knew it was a fit and started working together!"
Abandon's initial ForeFront release, the "Abandon EP" (produced by Chris Stevens), was released on July 22, 2008 and contains five tracks that will be released on their forthcoming studio album. Alternative rock song "Providence" and "All Because of You", which has a more contemporary style, were both released as radio singles on August 1, 2008. "Providence" has reached number-seven on "R&R"'s Christian rock chart as of October 24.
Abandon released its sophomore album Control on April 19, 2011.
The band's single "Live it Out" is currently featured on The Food Network for their promotion of the show Food Network Challenge and was used on the 2011 ESPY Awards Show on ESPN. It was also used in some of Channel Seven's highlights for the 2012 Australian Open.
In April, 2013 Abandon successfully funded their new album Kickstarter campaign and are currently working on a new album. 
Musical style.
Abandon's music and lead singer's voice have often been compared to The Killers.

<doc id="19906795" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19906795" title="Irish Seanad election, 1925">
Irish Seanad election, 1925

Elections for 19 of the 60 seats in Seanad Éireann, the Senate of the Irish Free State, were held on 17 September 1925. The election was by single transferable vote, with the entire state forming a single 19-seat electoral district. There were 76 candidates on the ballot paper, whom voters ranked by preference. Of the two main political parties, the larger (Cumann na nGaedheal) did not formally endorse any candidates, while the other (Sinn Féin, whose TDs were abstentionist) boycotted the election. Voter turnout was low and the outcome was considered unsatisfactory. Subsequently, senators were selected by the Oireachtas rather than the electorate.
Vacancies.
Under the provisions of the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State, Senators were to be elected for twelve-year terms, with the 60 Senators divided into four cohorts of 15, and an election every three years for one of the cohorts. As part of the initial transitional measures, 30 of the original 60 Senators in 1922 were selected by the Dáil, of whom the last 15 to secure election formed the cohort whose term would end after the first triennial period. As well as this cohort, four further Senators were required to vacate their seats: these had been temporarily co-opted to fill casual vacancies which had arisen in previous years.
Candidates.
There were three methods of being included on the ballot. Outgoing Senators could nominate themselves for re-election, and all 19 did so. The Seanad could nominate an equal number of candidates, and the Dáil could nominate twice the number of vacancies. Both Dáil and Seanad selections were by single transferable vote and secret ballot. The minimum age for Senators was 35 years.
The Seanad resolved on 30 April to form a committee to decide procedure for its nominations; the committee drafted a resolution in June, which was amended and passed by the Seanad on 19 June. 29 applicants contested the Seanad nominations on 1 July. Apart from two Labour Party members, the candidates were Independents. 47 of the 60 Senators voted, including 18 of the 19 who were themselves standing for re-election. Donal O'Sullivan, clerk of the Seanad throughout its existence, suggests that these 18 had an incentive to vote for less popular candidates since the nominees would be rivals in the ensuing election. O'Sullivan describes the results as "a very great disappointment ... the list successful candidates could not compare with the list of the ten rejected." Oliver St. John Gogarty made a similar remark in the Seanad itself after the results were announced.
The rejected ten were: David Barry, general manager of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company; Sir Laurence Grattan Esmonde, brother of Senator Thomas Grattan Esmonde, Bart; Lady Gregory; John J. Horgan; Hugh A. Law; John McCann, a stockbroker; The McGillicuddy of the Reeks; William Lombard Murphy, son of William Martin Murphy and proprietor of the "Irish Independent"; Sir John Harley Scott, a Unionist former Mayor of Cork; and J.J. Stafford, a County Wexford businessman.
The Dáil nominations were decided on 8 July. 57 candidates contested; 101 TDs voted, with one ballot deemed ineligible. 52 TDs did not vote, including all 44 abstentionist Sinn Féin TDs, who were ineligible to vote as they had not taken the Oath of Allegiance. TDs supported candidates on party lines. Of the 38 successful nominees, O'Sullivan classifies 21 as supporters of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, 9 as Independent, 5 as in the Farmers' Party, and 3 as in the Labour Party. Four of the ten candidates rejected by the Seanad were also among the Dáil candidates, with John J. Horgan securing a nomination at the second attempt.
Campaign.
While the Farmers' Party and Labour produced newspaper advertisements for their respective slates of candidates, Cumann na nGaedheal did not at a national level formally endorse candidates, even those its TDs had nominated. It presented the election as nonpartisan.
Numerous interest groups produced lists of approved candidates, including doctors, publicans, motorists, ex-servicemen's associations, and the livestock trade. Candidates endorsed by temperance groups fared badly. The Catholic Truth Society circulated, to little effect, a list of outgoing Senators it condemned for not having opposed a controversial motion pertaining to divorce.
Sinn Féin, under the leadership of Éamon de Valera, called for a boycott of the election. Sinn Féin had not boycotted the 1923 Dáil election, but rather contested it on an abstentionist platform. De Valera would later lead his Fianna Fáil party, founded in 1926, into the Oireachtas after the June 1927 Dáil election.
Election.
The election was by single transferable vote, with the entire Irish Free State forming a single, 19-seat constituency. All citizens over 30 had a vote. Since the voting age for Dáil and local elections was 21, a separate electoral roll was maintained for the Seanad election.
The 76 candidates were arranged alphabetically on a ballot paper long and wide. The Electoral (Seanad Elections) Act, 1925 was passed to allow the ballot to be presented as four parallel columns of 19 names rather than a single long column of all 76.
The low voter turnout was blamed on the Sinn Féin boycott, wet weather across the country, and the shorter than usual hours of polling. Turnout varied widely, from 8.2% in Mayo North to 43% in Monaghan. Another factor was the large, intimidating ballot paper; O'Sullivan describes it as "a fiasco", saying it was unreasonable to expect voters to "make an intelligent choice of nineteen persons from a list containing seventy-six names, most of which they had never seen or heard of before."
Results.
Counting.
The ballots were initially collected to one centre within each Dáil constituency to count and sort the first-preference votes. This took almost a week. On 25 September, the ballots were sent to Dublin, the totals checked centrally, and redistribution of transfers begun. On 5 October, the first candidate was returned, on the 45th count. Counting continued until 19 October.
Details.
Although the election was national, many of the candidates relied on local support. 23 gained more than half their first preferences from their own constituency.
Candidates of the two parties contesting the election, Labour and the Farmers', did relatively well. Some interest groups also did well — vintners, ex-servicemen. Others did not — doctors, academics, women, and especially Irish language revivalists: all four candidates supported by the Gaelic League lost, including outgoing senator and future president Douglas Hyde.
Ex-Unionist candidates did not fare well, even though the original design of the Seanad was intended in part to provide enhanced representation for the unionist minority.
Breakdown by candidate:
Legacy.
The shortcomings of the 1925 election created a consensus that a single national constituency was unworkable. In 1928, in the lead-up to the next triennial Seanad election, the Oireachtas formed a joint committee to change the selection procedures. While some members favoured retaining some form of voting by the general electorate, Fianna Fáil in particular wanted to ensure the Seanad was subordinate to the Dáil by restricting the franchise to Oireachtas members. Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Act provided for this. Thus, the 1925 election remains the only Seanad popular election.

Vecino

In Spanish-speaking areas, the word vecino is today used either as equivalent to the English word "" or to mean a resident of a place. Historically in Spain and its empire, it referred to a householder of considerable social position in a town or a city, similar to the term of "freeman" or "freeholder."
Historical use.
Historically, throughout the Spanish Empire a "vecino" was a person who has a house and home in a town or city and contributes to its expenses, not necessarily living near to the person referring to him; a local figure of some worth but not an aristocrat, often the "encomendero" holding land in the surrounding countryside with a house within a nearby city. A person with a house in a place that he contributes to can be a vecino although not currently living there. In the old sense it was closer to "freeholder" or "freeman" than "neighbour".
In the American colonies a "vecino" was sometimes a person of relatively high status, more than just free. In the "Indies" (Indias)—the American colonies such as the Viceroyalty of the River Plate—a vecino had to be married, living in the location, a property-owner, and of good public reputation. There were military formations of vecinos, and only vecinos were summoned to an open cabildo (an extraordinary open meeting of the administrative council). Although many laws referred to "vecinos", and others specified qualifications of residence, property, and respectability, the term "vecino" as such was in general use and not explicitly defined.
In the Viceroyalty, the status of vecino was important enough that the sons and daughters of vecinos who did not themselves qualify were referred to as "hijo de vecino" (son or daughter of a vecino), and qualified for some privileges. According to the relevant laws, the Leyes de Indias, IV, V, 8: "the sons and daughters and legitimate descendants of the residents are honoured with the title "well-born sons (or daughters) from a known location" (hijosdalgos de solar conocido) so that the population of that place (according to law 6 of book IV) and others of the Indies Americas should know them as such and as people of noble lineage, granting them all honours and privileges due to the well-born and gentlemen of Castile."

Life Sciences Institute

The Life Sciences Institute (LSI) is a collaborative, independent research institution located on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. It encompasses 25 faculty-led teams from 13 schools and departments throughout U-M. The LSI bring together leading scientists from a variety of life science disciplines, working in a range of animal models and using a number of cutting-edge research tools, to accelerate breakthroughs and discoveries that will improve human health and lead to new treatments for diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, cancer and infectious disease.
Of the university’s $823 million in research expenditures, more than half is allocated for research in the life sciences, and the LSI is a cornerstone of this effort.
History.
The Life Sciences Institute’s construction was approved by the Board of Regents in May 1999. Initial funding of $100 million was provided for the creation of wet lab space, in addition to the $130 million for the endowment and startup costs.
Leadership.
In January 2002, Mary Sue Coleman, U-M's president, appointed cell biologist and expert on insulin signaling Alan R. Saltiel as director. The institute’s first director was Jack E. Dixon. The managing director is Anna Schork.
Research.
The Center for Stem Cell Biology.
The Center for Stem Cell Biology is a collaborative division of the Life Sciences Institute where stem cells are studied in a cross-disciplinary manner. At the Center for Stem Cell Biology, questions addressed include fundamental inquiries into tissue development and cell communication. Morrison himself investigates the mechanisms underlying the functioning of stem cells in the nervous and hematopoietic systems. Morrison's lab has disproven the immortal strand hypothesis for blood-forming stem cells.
The Center for Chemical Genomics.
A High Throughput Screening (HTS) facility is a central component of the Center for Chemical Genomics (CCG). This core facility is designed to assist academic researchers in carrying out high-throughput screens of chemical libraries and to identify new tools for biological research.

Berliner Landespokal

The Berliner Landespokal () is an annual football cup competition held by the Berlin Football Association (German: Berliner Fußballverband, BFV). The cup winner qualifies for the national DFB-Pokal. Cup finals are usually held in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. The competition has been held since 1906, with various interruptions. Record winners are Tennis Borussia Berlin with a total of 16 titles.
Mode.
All BFV teams that compete in regular leagues are eligible, as well as the winner of the "Freizeitpokal" (a competition for recreational football teams). Teams competing in the Fußball-Bundesliga and the 2. Fußball-Bundesliga are not allowed to compete. Starting with the 2007–08 season, only the first teams of every club may compete in the cup. There is a separate cup competition for the reserve teams.
The competition is held in a knock-out tournament format, with each round consisting of a single match. If scores are level, extra time will be played, and a penalty shootout follows, if necessary. Home field advantage is determined by the draw, clubs share the revenue from the match. In the final, revenue is shared equally between the finalists and the Berlin FA.
1906–1950: Berlin and Brandenburg Cup.
History.
Until 1931 the cup was played as "Berliner Verbandspokal" (Berlin Association Cup) in the Berlin-Brandenburg area. From 1932 to 1942 it was not held, because the national Tschammerpokal was introduced. Beginning with the 1943 edition it was re-introduced as the "Gaupokal Berlin-Brandenburg", its winner qualifying for the national cup competition. In the 1943-44 season, the Gaupokal was held, but the DFB-Pokal could not be held due to the Second World War. After the war ended and Berlin was divided in four sectors, the cup was held as "Pokal des amerikanischen Drahtfunks" (Cup of American Wire Radio) from 1946–47, later renamed "RIAS-Pokal". Little had changed, with the notable exception that no Brandenburg clubs participated. From 1950, East Berlin clubs were no longer allowed to participate, they were incorporated into the East German football league system.
In the early years, the cup was dominated mostly by BFC Viktoria 1889 (initially under the name BTuFC Viktoria 1889). They managed to win the cup 5 times. But today's Bundesliga side Hertha BSC Berlin were able to capture the trophy five times as well.
1950–1991: West Berlin Cup.
History.
With the creation of the West German and East German states in 1949 and the subsequent introduction of the DDR-Oberliga and the FDGB-Pokal a lot changed for the Berlin Cup. Beginning with the 1950-51 season, East Berlin teams had to participate in the GDR competitions and the Berlin Cup was held for West Berlin teams only.
From 1950 to 1970 the cup was held under the name "Karl-Heinz-Schulz-Pokal". Schulz was a sports journalist and coach. Among other things he had coached the German rowing eight at the 1936 Olympic Games. Aged 39, he died after complications following surgery.
In 1969 there was no cup winner, as the penalty shootout was not yet introduced and Hertha 03 Zehlendorf took their traditional world tour immediately after the match, so a replay match could not be scheduled.
In 1970 the cup was renamed "Paul-Rusch-Pokal". Paul Rusch had been made first president of the Berlin FA in 1949. He held that position until 1970. All non-professional sides that participated in the regular league competitions held by the Berlin FA. Since the 1957–58 season, the cup winner has qualified for the national cup competition, the DFB-Pokal.
1992 until today: Berlin up for all of Berlin.
History.
After German reunification in 1990 football competition in East and West Berlin were unified in the 1991-92 season. Since then only two teams from the former GDR were able to win the cup. 1. FC Union Berlin won in 1994 and 2007 and Berliner FC Dynamo won the cup in 1994, 2011 and 2013. There are another three finals with an East Berlin finalist: 1997 with 1. FC Union Berlin, 2000 Berliner FC Dynamo, and most recently 2007 with Köpenicker SC.
The Paul Rusch Cup rarely attracted more than regional interest. But in 1992-93 the reserve of Hertha BSC attracted national interest when they reached the DFB-Pokal final after winning the Berlin Cup. In the final the team lost to Bayer Leverkusen. In 2001 two teams formed by immigrants faced each other for the first time in a German Regional Cup final. The Turkish derby between SV Yeşilyurt Berlin and Türkiyemspor Berlin generated international media interest and created for the first live broadcast of the Berlin Cup final by Turkish TV channel TRT-int.
In 2004 the competition was renamed again, bearing the name "ODDSET-Cup" until 2006. After a court decision this name could no longer be used and so the cup was held under the name "BFV-Pokal - unter der Schirmherrschaft von Lotto Berlin" (BFV-Cup - under the patronage of Lotto Berlin) or short "BFV-Pokal" (BFC-Cup), before it was renamed "Berliner-Pilsner-Pokal" (after a brand of beer) in 2007.

Marchmont Estate

Marchmont Estate lies near the village of Greenlaw in Berwickshire in the Scottish Borders area of Scotland, circa south east of Edinburgh. It is situated in the Merse, an area between the Lammermuirs to the north and the Cheviots to the south. It is part of what is commonly regarded as an exceptionally beautiful landscape, comprising a diverse range of land types from high and exposed grouse moor to rich alluvial agricultural land. The life of the estate has seen many stages, including rapid growth, shrinkage and stability, from its foundation in the fifteenth century under the first Hume owner, Patrick Hume, of Polwarth, through his successors and subsequent owners to the present day.
History.
The history of Marchmont Estate can only be marked out by noting the changes to its constitution during the course of its existence. There are a number of documents on the matter in places such as the National Archives of Scotland and Register House in Edinburgh, but many of these are estate papers dealing with internal or personal issues rather than the bigger picture. This article is interested more in the fluctuations of its size and reasons for this these changes.
Marchmont Estate was developed as a result of the improved fortunes of a certain Sir Patrick Hume, 8th Baron of Polwarth, born in 1641. As his territorial designation indicates, he lived in the parish of Polwarth (which was the core of the estate of Marchmont), a small but prosperous parish between Greenlaw and Duns. The name of the family seat was Redbraes Castle tp which they removed from Polwarth Castle following the latter's destruction in the 'Rough Wooing'wars of the 1540s. The Humes of Polwarth acquired the barony through marriage in 1470. A staunch supporter of William of Orange, Sir Patrick was forced to flee to Holland and Polwarth estates were confiscated in 1686. He returned with the new king, King William III of Great Britain in 1689 and was rewarded greatly by the king for his brave loyalty by being given the title Lord Polwarth in 1690. In addition his lands and other dignities were restored to him. Moreover, he was made Lord Chancellor in 1697 and created Earl of Marchmont, and then in 1698 was elevated to "the highest official position in the kingdom, that of the King's High Commissioner to the Parliament". These positions came with immense political power and therefore wealth. It is with this wealth that Marchmont Estate was able to grow so quickly while the Earl bought up surrounding lands and houses.
Changing fortunes.
The late 17th Century and most of the 18th Century saw the rapid expansion of the estate while the Humes of Marchmont were at their strongest financially and the most powerful magnates in Berwickshire. It was not however until 1755 that the Hume family moved from Redbraes Castle adjacent to their new home, Marchmont House, a family seat befitting such an estate. Ideas and plans had been drawn up earlier in the century by Alexander the 2nd Earl, but it was not until Hugh, the 3rd Earl’s time that the house was actually built. The construction of this great house, together with many of the land purchases in the 18th Century, were funded to a large extent by the sale of Cessnock estates, which came into the ownership of the family following the marriage between the Alexander the 2nd Earl, and Margaret Campbell. She was "a great heiress, and on her father’s death, in 1704, her husband succeeded him, not only in his Ayrshire estates, but also in his place on the Scottish Bench, where he sat under the same title of Lord Cessnock". The political power and wealth of the Hume family therefore continued. "Lord Marchmont took a great interest in his estates...he laid out a great deal of money on his property and very much increased its extent by the purchase of Home Castle and its surrounding lands, and also of other farms lying nearer the Tweed". 
In the 1779 “Accounts of the Rt Hon the Earl of Marchmont” by John Wauchope WS we can see exactly how fast the estate expanded. The detailed inventory lists all the purchases from the last part of the 17th Century and through most of the 18th Century. Many of the names of farms and lands listed in the inventory are still used today. Others are now unrecognisable owing to the changing patterns of agricultural land use. The list of names and dates of acquisitions include: Slegden 1668; Greenlaw 1697; Foulshallow (probably the now called Flourishwalls) 1700; Hallyburton 1702; East end of Fogo 1725; Bellshill 1710; Hurdlaw 1712; Gordonbank, Bellshill, Spencerigg 1775;Barony of Hume 1766; Rollandston 1762 Braelands of Hapington (Hassington), east end of Fogo 1771; Eccleshill 1779; The Slap 1779. The estate acquired farms many miles away and apparently unconnected to the existing land. Such farms were Headshaw and Kelphope at Carfrae, roughly half way to Edinburgh.Channanbank at Abbey St. Bathans had been added to the estate much earlier in the 1660s.. It is not easy to see why these were bought as they don’t seem to be part of a geographical pattern.
In addition to the “Accounts of the Rt Hon the Earl of Marchmont” there are 2 further reliable references that document the composition of the estate and thereby act as milestones in its history. First is the detailed 1825 atlas and survey of the estate when in the ownership of Sir William P. Hume Campbell. The second is the sale particulars of the auction of the house and estate in June 1913, held by John D Wood and instructed on behalf of Sir John Hume Campbell, Bt., the last of the Hume owners.
The 1825 survey states that the lands extend to about . Such was the importance of the estate that a railway station was built for it, presumably as much for agricultural use as personal. The station was situated between Duns and Greenlaw stations on the Berwickshire Railway line which was opened on 1 August 1849 to join Reston to the main Edinburgh to Hawick line at Ravenswood Junction near St Boswells. The track at Marchmont was lifted in 1953. However by the time the estate was put up for sale in 1913, approximately 90 years later, the estate had reduced in size to about . in fact the size of the estate when eventually sold at auction was . The reduction in the size of the estate was due to the dwindling wealth of the Hume family of Marchmont. Many of the outlying farms were sold off, in particular the belt of estate situated south of Greenlaw such as Hume, Stanmore, Belmont and Hassendean. These are recorded as being part of Marchmont in a plan of the estate dated 1902. Therefore the disposal of these must have taken place in the first few years of the 20th Century. The central core north and north west of Greenlaw was largely retained. It is no surprise that the parkland around the house has changed little over the 250 years or so since the house was built. Although some trees have been cut down, the handsome avenue, arguably the longest in Scotland, stills leads to the house from a north easterly direction. During the remainder of most of the 20th Century and during the time of the former proprieter the estate comprised the following farms: Woodheads, Whiteside Slegden, Clerkenville, Castlemill, Elwartlaw and Cothill, the last two being sold off in about 1978 and 1981 respectively. However latterly the estate has seen some of areas of land bought back or added. It now has about of freehold land and a further of leased land, a total which is significant by modern day standards.
Research into the subject shows there are a number of documents of incidental interest that one comes across that tell a more human story about the estate and its workings. The Marchmont estate "Work Bork" of 1743-45 lists, day by day, the tasks of the estate labourers, where they worked and how much they were paid. We can take Jo Nisbet, one of those workers, as an example. He is detailed as "digging Marle" on Monday 20th. Marl, like lime was used as a soil additive, improving it chemically and biologically, and was used in areas such as this in Berwickshire and Roxburghshire which had clay soil. At places like Marchmont in the lowlands, adding marl and lime was central to agricultural success by improving the soil. He then went on to carry out other duties such as "moeing" or "forking hay", "holding up plow", "threshing oats", and "draining nursery". For 4 days work they would be typically be paid ¼, going up to 2- for 6 days work. Most of the 25 or so men worked 6 days a week, even on Christmas Day and other days we would consider holidays.

Master Dji

George Lys Herard (May 30, 1961 – May 21, 1994), popularly known as Master Dji, was a Haitian rapper, and Hip-Hop artist. DJ of the group "Haiti Rap' N Ragga", Master Dji was the founder of Creole hip-hop. 
Best known for his debut album "Master Dji", considered by many one of the greatest Creole Hip-Hop albums of all time. This album established Master Dji as one of Haiti ’s most profound lyricists, introducing his signature which is poetic. 
Master Dji was also a radio host at Radio Metropole and Tropic FM. A pioneer in the Haitian Music Industry, he created a very subdued genre of music which was not previously thought of before. Due to his creation the New generation was able to form a connection between rara, rasin, konpa, rap and reggae. He pioneered a type of music that is a combination of all the music genres that most Young people listen to in Haiti. Master Dji knew how to get the attention of the young people, so throughout his music he would talk and also educate them. 
Hip-Hop was not that Popular in Haiti , moreover, society had a bad perception of the music. However Master Dji managed to get his tracks played by certain radio stations. He was versatile; whether it was in English, French or Creole he always found a way to rip the mic. With all three languages he reached out to many different crowds. As a result, he was also known overseas. In fact, he's one of a few MCs to be played for more than twelve hours in radio stations in Africa. 
"Tann pou tann" by Master Dji received the first prize from the annual African Haitian video awards which was held from April 27 to May 7, 1995, and organized by "Disques Hibiscus" with the participation of the televised music channel "MusiquePlus". The video was Directed by Master Dji himself and Jean-Pierre Grasset. The award jury and Ralph Boney decided to name the annual video award show after "Master Dji" in honor of the Haitian rapper, visionary, father of kreyol hip-hop, and pioneer of music videos in the Caribbean since 1985. 
The first rap song in Creole was a track called Vakans by Master Dji in 1982. A few years later (late 1980s) he released his first album entitled Master Dji. 
His second album entitled "Politik Pam" was released in 1990 under bwa patat records; his third album was with his group "Haiti Rap' N Ragga" entitled "Match La Red"; it was released under Declic Communication in France. 
His fourth album, with his group, entitled "Maximum Respect" was released under Cross over records in Florida. "Maximum Respect" was Master Dji's last project before dying. 
From May 20 to May 22, 2005, Rapforum organized a summit called Master Dji to honor the late rapper. Master Dji was not only known in Haiti, but also throughout the whole Caribbean as the founder of kreyol hip-hop. The event took place at "Place Jérémie", where hundreds of teens had the chance to discover the different talents and life of the pioneer. 
His legacy was not only that of a rapper, a singer, dj, but also a radio host, ever since he was 16 Several pictures, lyrics, and videos were put together by SOLDAT PRODUCTIONS. Those documents were provided by "Mme Sita Hérard, mother of Master Dji. Among the different people who attended the event, were: Eliacim Abollassen (Soldat Productions), Garry Saint-Germain (Rapforum), and James Berlus (Asrap). 
Master Dji was the greatest Haitian MC. He was a visionary. He created something new in a country where people did not even like hip-hop. The Haitian community had very little knowledge of what hip-hop was back then, and it was hard for them to accept it. Master Dji managed to mix reggae, konpa, and hip-hop to form a new sound; and the public embraced it. He was also very political, and his lyrics were deep and carried a message behind the songs. Master Dji’s work is often overlooked- with only true kreyol hip-hop fans, purists and kreyol hip-hop artists paying homage to the legend.
