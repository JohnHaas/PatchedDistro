Turjak Castle

Turjak Castle ( or "Turjaški grad", , later "Burg Auersperg") is a 13th-century castle located above the settlement of Turjak, part of the municipality of Velike Lašče in the Lower Carniola region of Slovenia. The castle is 20 km SE of Ljubljana and is considered among of the most impressive in the area.
Etymology.
The origin of the castle's name is uncertain: local tradition has held that it derives from the exctinct wild cattle aurochs (in Slovene, "tur"). It is likelier a corruption of the name of its founders, the knights Ursberg or Auersperg. The similarity to Turriaco in Italy, also known as "Turjak" in Slovene, is widely considered coincidental.
History.
The first Turjak castle was built on the site as early as the late 11th century by the knights (later counts) von Auersperg. It may have been extant by 1062, the date the family (specifically Konrad von Auersperg) is first mentioned. In 1140, it was destroyed and burned during a succession struggle between the two heirs of Pilgram II von Auersperg, his son Pilgram IV and his son-in-law Otto von Ortenburg. The castle was held by Pilgram IV, who was defeated.
In 1190 it was rebuilt by count Adolf II von Auersperg, whose son Otto became entangled in a complicated war with the noble houses of von Gortz, Ortenburg, and the Patriarchate of Aquileia, during which the castle was again flattened. Afterward, the site of the first two castles was abandoned in favor of the current one further upslope.
The current castle is first mentioned in 1220. In 1270, Peter and Wolfgang von Auersperg sold it to another branch of the family, only to have it bought back by Balthazar von Auersperg, chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 14th century, Auersperg owners included Gerhard (1317), and the brothers Friederich, Volkard and Herward. The castle was completely destroyed by the great earthquake of 1511, but was rebuilt in time to successfully resist a furious peasants' revolt in 1515 that laid waste to several other castles in the region. It faced a more serious challenge from Turkish raiders, who undertook major assaults against it in 1491 and 1528, but were repelled both times.
The Auerspergs had a reputation as capable military leaders; Ivan of Turjak fell in the battle of Vienna in 1529, Herbard of Turjak (Herbard VIII von Auersperg) died at Budačko in 1575, while Andreas von Auersperg, the "Carniolan Achilles," commanded Carinthian and Carniolan forces at the battle of Sisak and contributed to a decisive victory against the Ottomans on 22 June 1593.
During the 16th century, the Auerspergs were strong supporters of the Protestant Reformation in Slovenia. The major Slovene Protestant leaders Primož Trubar and Jurij Dalmatin were offered sanctuary at the castle, and worked on the first translation of the Bible into Slovene during their stay. The Counts also offered financial support to the project of printing some of the first Slovene books.
17th century Turjak lords included Johan Andreas von Auersperg and Wolf Engelbert von Auersperg, the last noted by the historian Valvasor, who attested to the castle's importance by including two etchings of it in his ""Glory of the Duchy of Carniola""of 1689, including a two-page spread. 
His son and successor Adam Anton Siegfried established a "fideicommiss" or entailment in 1739 (the year of his death), including the Turjak lordship, the holding of Nadlischegg in Mokronog and the Turjak (or Auersperg) Palace in Ljubljana. He was succeeded by eldest son Adolf Engelbert Ignaz, who died in 1768. On 20 May 1769, the allodial land ownership passed to his widow Elisabeth ("nee" Lichtenberg}, while the fideicommiss went to his brother-in-law Josef Maria. 
After his death on 24 December 1805, the fideicommiss properties went to Johann Paul Alois, and then to the count Josef von Auersperg, who held it until his death on 12 October 1883, followed by his son count Leo von Auersperg. Between 1916 and 1931, the owner of the fideicommiss was Leo's son Herward, followed by his son, also named Herward. 
On 19 September 1943, the castle was taken by Partisans (ironically of the Prešeren brigade) after a lengthy battle with its garrison of White Guard Slovene Axis auxiliaries. About five hundred of them were taken prisoner and became the target of retribution, in the form of notable war crimes. The castle was severely damaged in the battle, and lay in ruins for several years. Following WWII, the castle was nationalized, and restoration work slowly undertaken.
In 2006, the president of Slovenia, Janez Drnovšek, founded the Movement for Justice and Development, a civil-society group, at a large rally at the castle.
Architecture.
The castle is of triangular layout and stands on a terraced hill. Large Renaissance defensive towers (bastilles) at the points of the triangle are connected by residential wings. The western tower contains a suite of dungeons of varying degrees of unpleasantness. The tall central palacium dates from the Romantic period.
The castle has been significantly altered several times throughout its history. As recently as the 1680s, the Valvasor engravings show a rectangular structure with small towers at only two corners and a large bastille at the eastern end. This layout dates to the major rebuilding after the devastating 1512 earthquake, though some pre-16th century elements survive, notably the north wing and portions of the defensive walls. 
The original 10th- or 11th-century castle stood lower on the slope; some minor ruins are still visible.
The castle is unusual in having two chapels. A Catholic one on the west side has served as a church since 1789; after a 1990 renovation, mass has been held there every Sunday. A second Romanesque Protestant chapel is named after Dalmatin, and contains the tombs of the Protestant counts, as well as gothic frescoes.
The coat-of-arms and the bison are engraved next to the text, that was glided once upon a time. The inscription announced:
Cultural significance.
Turjak Castle is fairly well known in Slovenia, in part for its colorful and turbulent history, which includes several grotesque vignettes:
The castle is also known for its importance to the history of the Reformation in Slovene lands; its greatest claim to fame, however, is as the setting of one of Slovene national poet France Prešeren's most popular ballads, "Rosamund of Turjak" ("Turjaška Rozamunda"). It concerns the wooing of the bratty heiress of Turjak in the late Middle Ages.

1900–01 FA Cup

The 1900–01 FA Cup was the 30th season of the world's oldest association football competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (more usually known as the FA Cup). The cup was won by Tottenham Hotspur of the Southern League, who defeated Sheffield United 3–1 in a replay after a 2–2 draw in the first game. This was the first and only occasion since the formation of The Football League in 1888 that a club from outside the League won the cup.
Matches were scheduled to be played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played, a replay would take place at the stadium of the second-named team later the same week. If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held at neutral venues until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.
Calendar.
The format of the FA Cup for the season had a preliminary round, five qualifying rounds, an intermediate round, three proper rounds, and the semi finals and final.
Intermediate Round.
The Intermediate Round featured ten games, played between the ten winners of the Fifth Qualifying Round, and ten teams given byes. Football League First Division Liverpool and Stoke, along with Burslem Port Vale, Glossop, Grimsby Town, Newton Heath, New Brighton Tower and Woolwich Arsenal from the Football League Second Division were entered automatically into this round, as were Southern League Division One Portsmouth and Bristol City.
The other Second Division sides had to gain entry to this round through the earlier qualifying rounds. Barnsley, Blackpool, Burton Swifts, Chesterfield, Gainsborough Trinity, Lincoln City, Middlesbrough, Stockport County and Walsall were all entered in the Third Qualifying Round. Of these, only Chesterfield, Middlesbrough and Walsall reached the Intermediate Round. They were joined by seven other non-league sides.
The ten matches were played on 5 January 1901. One tie went to a replay, played in the following midweek. This rematch again resulted in a draw, so a second replay was played the following week at a neutral venue (Swindon Town's County Ground).
First round proper.
The First Round Proper contained sixteen ties between 32 teams. The remaining 16 of the 18 Football League First Division sides were given a bye to this round, as were Small Heath, Burnley and Leicester Fosse from the Football League Second Division, and Southern League Division One Southampton, Millwall Athletic and Tottenham Hotspur. They joined the ten teams who won in the intermediate round.
The matches were played on Saturday 9 February 1901. Four matches were drawn, with the replays taking place in the following midweek.
Second Round Proper.
The eight Second Round matches were scheduled for Saturday 23 February 1901. There was one replay, between Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest, played in the following midweek.

Semi-Finals.
The semi-final matches were both intended to be played on Saturday 6 April 1901. Sheffield United and Aston Villa played on this date, but drew their tie and had to replay it five days later; this next match finished in a 3–0 win for United. The other game, Tottenham Hotspur against West Bromwich Albion, was delayed until Monday 8 April and finished in a convincing win for Spurs.
Final.
The final took place on Saturday 20 April 1901 at Crystal Palace. Over 110,000 supporters attended the match. Fred Priest opened the scoring for Sheffield United after about 20 minutes. Sandy Brown headed an equalising goal shortly afterwards and half time arrived with the score 1–1. Brown put Spurs ahead early in the second half, but, not to be denied, Sheffield United pressed strongly, and Walter Bennett headed an equaliser for the draw.
In the replay, Spurs became the first and only "non (Football) league" side to win the FA Cup since the creation of Football League when they beat United 3–1 before an attendance of 20,470 at Burnden Park, Bolton. John Cameron opened the scoring before centre forward Sandy Brown became the first player to score in every round. He netted both goals in the final as well as one in the replay for a total of 15 in the season's competition.

1896–97 FA Cup

The 1896–1897 FA Cup was the 26th season of the world's oldest association football competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (more usually known as the FA Cup). The cup was won by Aston Villa, who defeated Everton 3–2 in the final of the competition, played at Crystal Palace in London. In doing so, Aston Villa became only the second team to have won the Double, as they won the league on the same day as their cup victory (and the only team to do this).
Matches were scheduled to be played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played, a replay would take place at the stadium of the second-named team later the same week. If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held at neutral venues until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.
Calendar.
The format of the FA Cup for the season had a preliminary round, five qualifying rounds, three proper rounds, and the semi finals and final. Each of the Rounds Proper were played on a set date, whereas the Preliminary and Qualifying Round matches were played on several dates over a given period of time.
First round proper.
The First Round Proper contained 16 ties between 32 teams. The 16 First Division sides were given a bye to this round, as were Notts County, Small Heath, Burton Wanderers, Grimsby Town, Newcastle United and Manchester City from the Second Division. The other Second Division sides were entered into the Third Qualifying Round. Of those sides, only Newton Heath and Burton Swifts qualified to the FA Cup Proper. Eight non-league sides also qualified.
The matches were played on Saturday, 30 January 1897. One match was drawn, with the replay taking place in the following midweek fixture.
Second Round Proper.
The eight Second Round matches were scheduled for Saturday, 13 February 1897. There was one replay, played in the following midweek fixture.
Third round proper.
The four Third Round matches were scheduled for Saturday, 27 February 1897. There were two replays, played in the following midweek fixture, of which the Preston North End – Aston Villa match went to a second replay the following week.
Semi-Finals.
The semi-final matches were both played on Saturday, 20 March 1897. Aston Villa and Everton went on to meet in the final at Crystal Palace.
Final.
The final took place on Saturday, 10 April 1897 at Crystal Palace. Just under 66,000 supporters attended the match. John Campbell opened the scoring for Villa after 18 minutes. Villa's lead was maintained for only five minutes before Everton equalised, through a goal from Jack Bell. Everton then went in front after Dickie Boyle scored five minutes later, but that lead only lasted seven minutes, when Fred Wheldon got an equaliser. Jimmy Crabtree put Villa back in front just before half-time, and Villa managed to come through the second half without conceding, meaning they had become only the second team ever to win the Double in England.

Estelle Reiner

Estelle Reiner (June 5, 1914 – October 25, 2008), described by "The New York Times" as "matriarch of one of the leading families in American comedy", was an actress and singer. She was the wife of Carl Reiner and the mother of actor/comedian/director/activist Rob Reiner. 
Life and career.
Reiner was born Estelle Lebost in The Bronx, New York City, and graduated from James Monroe High School. She was a visual artist and met her future husband, Carl Reiner, while she was working in the Catskills, designing stage sets for hotel shows. She married Reiner in 1943, and had three children Rob, Lucas and Annie.
Carl Reiner's 1960s television comedy, "The Dick Van Dyke Show", recapitulated his career writing for Sid Caesar, with Carl Reiner playing the Caesar character and Dick Van Dyke portraying Reiner's real-life job as a writer in the role of Rob Petrie. The re-creation was so complete that the Petries in the show lived on Bonnie Meadow Road in suburban New Rochelle, New York, the same street as the real-life Reiners. As described by Rob Reiner, "Basically he wrote his own life" in "The Dick Van Dyke Show" and that his "mother was Mary Tyler Moore".
In her 60s, Reiner became a cabaret singer and performed for decades, until just a few years before her death. She studied acting with method acting pioneer Lee Strasberg and with Viola Spolin, the American Grandmother of Improvisation. She appeared in a number of film comedies, including the 1980 film "Fatso" with Dom DeLuise as Mrs. Goodman, and in the 1983 movies "The Man With Two Brains" with Steve Martin in the role "Tourist in Elevator" and in Mel Brooks' "To Be or Not to Be" as Gruba.
Reiner's most enduring film role was in 1989's "When Harry Met Sally...", in which director Rob Reiner cast his mother as a customer in a scene with stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at Katz's Delicatessen, in which Ryan fakes what was described as "a very public (and very persuasive) orgasm". Approached by a waitress after Ryan finishes, Reiner deadpans "I’ll have what she’s having". The line was ranked 33rd on the American Film Institute's list of the Top 100 movie quotations, just behind "Casablanca"'s "Round up the usual suspects".
Death.
Reiner died of natural causes on October 25, 2008 at age 94 in her home in Beverly Hills, California.

MapleSim

MapleSim is a multi-domain modeling and simulation tool developed by Maplesoft. MapleSim generates model equations, runs simulations, and performs analyses using the symbolic and numeric mathematical engine of Maple. Models are created by dragging-and-dropping components from a library into a central workspace, resulting in a model that represents the physical system in a graphical form.
Maplesoft began development of MapleSim partly in response to a request from Toyota to produce physical modeling tools to aid in their new model-based development process. 
The MapleSim library includes many components that can be connected together to model a system. These components are from areas of science and engineering such as electrical, mechanical, and thermal engineering fields. MapleSim also includes traditional signal flow components that can be combined with other physical components in the workspace. Thus, MapleSim is able to combine causal modeling methods with acausal techniques that do not require specification of signal flow direction between all components.
The use of Maple underneath MapleSim allows all of the system equations to be generated and simplified automatically. The user can explore their system in various ways, such as viewing the equations behind their model and performing parameter optimization. The use of the Maple mathematics engine also allows for MapleSim to incorporate such features as units management and solving of high-order DAEs that are typically encountered in complex acausal models.

The theater is part of an eight-story complex that was the first steel-framed high-rise building in Missoula, and includes the main 1066-seat hall, two 125-seat cinemas, three banquet rooms, a restaurant, apartments and offices. The theater now seats less patrons as four rows of seats were removed from the floor level in 2010. The theater interior is decorated with Louis XIV Style gilt trim. The International Wildlife Film Festival is held at the Wilma annually.
The Wilma's original theater organ was replaced in the 1950s with a Robert Morton organ from the Orpheum Theater in Spokane, Washington, which had been torn down in 1958.
As originally built, the basement housed a swimming pool, the "Crystal Plunge". Condensation proved incompatible with the structure, and the pool closed within ten years. It now serves as additional storage space.
The Wilma now shows a diverse range of entertainment, including independent movies, spoken word events, live and local music, plays, and other events. Many major acts routinely visit The Wilma yearly. 
The theater is equipped with a full PA system and stage monitors with Yamaha M7 consoles at the core, as well as a secondary PA for use with the main movie screen.

The National Archives Site is an archeological site at the National Archives facility in College Park, Prince George's County, Maryland. The site contains archeological remains from prehistoric settlements during the Late Archaic period, c. 4000-1500 B.C. Stone artifacts recovered through archeological testing indicate that this camp served as a place of stone tool manufacture and probably as a staging point for hunting and foraging. Physical integrity of the prehistoric component is high, with little plow disturbance or admixture with artifacts from other periods. The presence of a small number of other artifacts, including the projectile points, a spokeshave, and utilized flakes, indicates that the site also served in other hunting and foraging pursuits.

El Dorado (1921 film)

El Dorado is a French silent film directed in 1921 by Marcel L'Herbier. The film was notable for integrating a number of technical innovations into its narrative of a "cinematic melodrama". It achieved considerable success on its release, as a ground-breaking film that was distinctively French at a time when the cinema was felt to be dominated by American productions.
Background.
In his previous five films Marcel L'Herbier had explored a variety of photographic and narrative techniques in the fast-developing medium of film, and in 1921 he wanted to draw them together in the context of a story which would have a broad appeal for the public. He was also eager to film in the landscapes of Spain which had long been an inspiration for him, especially as filtered through the writings of Maurice Barrès. 
He submitted an original scenario for a melodrama called "El Dorado", set in Andalusia, to his producer Léon Gaumont, and rather to his surprise it was immediately accepted. L'Herbier was adamant that the film should carry the subtitle "mélodrame", both to indicate the popular origins of its story, but also to point to its more traditional sense of the combination of drama and music. He was less candid about his intentions for incorporating imaginative and unconventional visual effects into his familiar subject-matter. 
An initial budget of 92,000 francs was allocated, but in the end the film cost nearly 400,000 francs.
Synopsis.
In Granada in Spain, Sibilla works as a dancer in a squalid cabaret called El Dorado, struggling to earn enough to care for her sick child. The boy's father Estoria, a prominent citizen, refuses them both help and recognition, fearful of jeopardising the engagement of his adult daughter Iliana to a wealthy nobleman. Iliana however slips away from her engagement party to meet her real lover Hedwick, a Swedish painter. Sibilla, in desperation after a further rejection by Estoria, sees an opportunity to blackmail him by locking the lovers overnight in their meeting-place in the Alhambra. When Hedwick learns the truth next day, he and Iliana decide to take refuge at his mother's remote house on the Sierra Nevada, and they propose to Sibilla that they should take her son (Iliana's half-brother) with them so that he can be properly cared for in a healthy climate. Sibilla reluctantly agrees, but she is distraught as she returns to her empty room at El Dorado where she even has to fight off Joao, the cabaret's clown, as he tries to rape her. Knowing that she will not see her son again, she performs a last dance on stage to rapturous applause before going backstage to stab herself.

Production.
A substantial part of the film was to be shot on location in Granada, Seville and the Sierra Nevada, and filming began in March 1921. For the first time ever, permission had been granted for a film company to shoot inside the Alhambra palace and L'Herbier gave prominent place to its gardens, fountains and geometric architectural patterns. These became some of the film's most memorable images. During the approach to Easter, he also seized the chance to film the spectacular Holy Week processions which took place in Seville and to incorporate this documentary footage within the fiction of his story. The interiors were subsequently filmed at the Gaumont studios in Paris at Buttes-Chaumont.
With his principal cameraman Georges Lucas, L'Herbier created a number of optical effects during filming. When Sibilla is first introduced among the other dancers on stage, a partial blurring of the image places her out-of-focus while those around her are sharply defined, an effect repeated in her subsequent dance to suggest that she herself is not fully focussed on her surroundings because her mind is preoccupied with the plight of her son. Distortion of close-up images of customers in the cabaret reflect their intoxication and lust. A similar technique is used later to introduce a note of visual horror into the scene when Joao tries to rape Sibilla. A different use of optical distortion in the scenes of Hedwick at work in the Alhambra shows how the actual settings of his paintings are transformed in the painter's imagination. L'Herbier was at pains to draw a distinction between his approach and that used in "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" (1919) in which visual distortions are incorporated into the design of the sets - which were then photographed normally. In "El Dorado" it is the camera itself which is used to shape the images seen by the viewer. These uses of semi-subjective camerawork have been one of the most discussed aspects of the film in subsequent criticism.
L'Herbier was an ardent advocate of colour tinting of the finished photographic image, and he devised an elaborate scheme of colouring to enhance the effect of different scenes and shots, and sometimes to clarify the shift between the present and a past flashback. (A surviving print held by the Cinémathèque Française preserves these tinted effects.) 
L'Herbier regarded the musical accompaniment of a film as being supremely important, and in "El Dorado" he sought to produce a closer integration between image and music than had been achieved before. He commissioned the young composer Marius-François Gaillard (who was only 21) to compose an orchestral score which was based upon the final cut of the film. This allowed the music to be precisely synchronised with the action of the film instead of the rather approximate playing of 'mood music' which was then common practice. L'Herbier claimed that this was the first time that an exactly synchronised orchestral score had been written for a film, and although full scores for films had been previously produced in Europe and USA, this was at least a pioneering example of music written as an exact counterpoint to the image.
L'Herbier enjoyed complete artistic freedom during filming but his relations with his producer Léon Gaumont deteriorated as the schedule and the budget both exceeded expectations. Gaumont was not impressed by the 'artistic' visual devices of blurred and distorted images. When the film was first shown to him, he angrily interrupted the screening to demand that the projectionist should correct his equipment, and he was scarcely mollified when it was explained that these were a deliberate part of the director's vision.
Reception.
When the film was first shown to the press in July 1921, it met with widespread critical acclaim. The newspaper "Bonsoir" unprecedentedly devoted a whole page to its review in which three different critics were unanimous in their recognition of the film's historic importance. Another critic appreciated that the use of a melodramatic subject did not prevent the film from achieving "a magnificent poetry". There was particular praise for the performance of Éve Francis who achieves an intense tragic grandeur in the final scenes. The critic and film-maker Louis Delluc gave the film perhaps its most succinct judgment: "Ça, c'est du cinéma!" ("That's cinema!")
There were a few dissenting voices including the poet and critic Ricciotto Canudo, who felt that the film's pictorial effects were insufficiently grounded in the subject. 
When the film was released to the public in October 1921 it enjoyed a broad success, even though some spectators were sufficiently impatient with the visual effects to make occasionally vocal protests. 
The considerable reputation which the film won in the 1920s was largely confined to France at that time since it does not appear to have been distributed abroad. 
Among those who subsequently felt the influence of "El Dorado" was Alain Resnais who "sought to renew a certain style of silent cinema" when he was making "L'Année dernière à Marienbad".
Restoration.
A restoration of "El Dorado" was carried out for Gaumont in 1995 by the Service des Archives du Film du CNC, in collaboration with the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Cinémathèque française, and the Swiss Film Archive. A DVD based on this restoration, accompanied by archival material, was released by Gaumont in 2002.

Pro-innovation bias

In diffusion of innovation theory, a pro-innovation bias is the belief that an innovation should be adopted by whole society without the need of its alteration. The innovation's "champion" has such strong bias in favor of the innovation, that he/she may not see its limitations or weaknesses and continues to promote it nonetheless.
Example.
A feeling of nuclear optimism emerged in the 1950s in which it was believed that all power generators in the future would be atomic in nature. The atomic bomb would render all conventional explosives obsolete and nuclear power plants would do the same for power sources such as coal and oil. There was a general feeling that everything would use a nuclear power source of some sort, in a positive and productive way, from irradiating food to preserve it, to the development of nuclear medicine. There would be an age of peace and plenty in which atomic energy would "provide the power needed to desalinate water for the thirsty, irrigate the deserts for the hungry, and fuel interstellar travel deep into outer space". This use would render the Atomic Age as significant a step in technological progress as the first smelting of Bronze, of Iron, or the commencement of the Industrial Revolution.
Roger Smith, then chairman of General Motors, said in 1986: "By the turn of the century, we will live in a paperless society." In the late 20th century, there were many predictions of this kind. This transformation has so far not taken place.

Stretchheads

Stretchheads were a punk band from Erskine, Scotland active between 1987 and 1991, releasing two albums in that period.
History.
The band was formed in 1987 by Andy Maconald (aka "Dr. Technology", guitar), P6 (aka "Fat Bastard", "Wilberforce", real name Phil Eaglesham, vocals), with the line-up completed by Mofungo Diggs (Steven MacDougall, bass) and Richie Dempsey (drums). The band wore asbestos firewear, gas masks, flashy shirts and balaclavas on stage, and blossomed after support slots with the Happy Mondays, The Wonderstuff and The Shamen. They began their recording career on the Moksha Recordings label with the "Bros are Pish" EP, poking fun at then chart-toppers Bros, among others. This resulted in discussion in a Smash Hits interview, with Craig explaining to the Goss brothers what 'Pish' Meant. Their debut album, "Five Fingers, Four Fingers, a Thumb, a Facelift and a New Identity" followed in 1989. Dempsey departed to join Dawson, and was replaced by Mr. Jason (Jason Boyce) of the Dandilion Adventure, and the band were signed up by top indie label Blast First. Their first release on Blast First was the 1990 EP "Eyeball Origami Aftermath Wit Vegetarian Leg". A further single "23 Skinner" followed in January 1991 before their second album was issued, "Pish In Your Sleazebag". Touring Europe and playing shows with Dutch band Revenge Of The Carrots and old colleagues Dog Faced Hermans, the band split up in 1992, before which they recorded a session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. Two years later, their last, posthumous, release was the "Barbed Anal Exciter" EP.
Phil Eaglesham and Richie Dempsey are currently both members of DeSalvo, along with Allan Stewart of Idlewild and Alex Grant, formerly of Idlewild. The band released their debut album on Mogwai's Rock Action Records in 2008.
Musical style.
Musically they were influenced by both the US independent hardcore of Butthole Surfers, Killdozer and British indie bands such as Big Flame and Bogshed, and attempted to take the sound of those bands to a new extreme. They have since been compared to the Japanese noise rock of the Boredoms and Ruins. p6's vocals have been described as "inhuman, reminiscent of nothing so much as Sesame Street's Grover with electrodes affixed to his genitals", with their music described as "the weirdest, fastest and heaviest thing ever to come cartwheeling out of the British Isles".

Rugby union in Brunei

Rugby Union is a minor sport in Brunei
Governing body.
The Brunei Rugby Football Union is the governing body of Rugby Union in Brunei. It is still in its infancy, being admitted into the Asian Rugby Football Union in 2004, and more recently, into the International Rugby Board in 2005. It was set up in 1977, and registered officially as a society in November 2004, and has been formally admitted as an associate member of the Asian Rugby Football Union. It was granted full membership in the game's controlling body, the International Rugby Board in late 2005.
History.
Rugby Union, which is played in 105 countries around the world, has already been played in Brunei since the 1950s. According to the archives of the Royal Brunei Yacht Club, a "Town Rugby Football Team" played a team from the Seria district in 1957. In the mid 1970s, rugby in Brunei grew in popularity with the influx of expatriates from Britain and active participation from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces (RBAF), Brunei Shell Recreation Club, Royal Brunei Yacht Club, the Panaga Club and the British Garrison in Seria.
A domestic competition took place from 1978 to 1993, involving regular teams from the Panaga Club, the Royal Brunei Yacht Club, the British Garrison, the Royal Brunei Armed Forces, the Royal Brunei Police and Pirates RFC.
Numerous clubs also organised Rugby sevens and tens competitions from time to time, but the large number of British and Commonwealth expatriates leaving the sultanate in the late 1990s led to a decline in the number of such tournaments.

Yorkshire Rams are an English American Football club, based in Leeds, West Yorkshire. They are currently playing in British American Football Association Community League Northern Premiership.
History.
The club was founded in March 1987 in Huddersfield and was based at the Rugby union football club ground, in the Waterloo area. Shortly after they moved to the Fartown Rugby league ground. The club were originally called Huddersfield Rams.
In 1990 the club again moved home to the Leeds road Hockey pitch, in Huddersfield. This venue was short lived as 1991 saw a major reorganisation of the club, both to a new and more permanent home at the Dalton based Amateur rugby league football club ground in Moldgreen, also in Huddersfield. In view of the increase of the size of the club's recruiting area this reorganisation also saw the change of the club's name to the Yorkshire Rams.
In 1996 the club moved to more luxurious conditions at the Lawrence Batley Sports Centre at Salendine Nook in Huddersfield. The following year they moved both venue and home town to the Walton Sports & Social club in Wakefield, The following year due to Health and safety rules the club again moved home to the Westgate Redoubt ARLFC, in Wakefield
After a good season and some sponsorship, in 2004, the Rams found themselves moving to the Rams Stadium, home of the Dewsbury Rams in Kirklees. The club ground was renamed in 2005 to the Tetley Stadium. Again the following year, 2006, saw another move of club venue to the Milnthorpe Green home of Sandal RUFC in Wakefield.

2010.
The Rams tried to build on 2009's success and recorded an impressive 7-3-0 record. The Yorkshire Rams shut out Gateshead Senators and Merseyside Nighthawks in impressive displays, but ultimately an increasing amount of injuries would take their toll, as the Rams narrowly lost to the Ipswich Cardinals in the Playoff's prematurely ending an outstanding season.
2012.
Play Offs 2011.
The Yorkshire Rams drew their old rivals the East Kilbride Pirates in the Quarter Finals of the Division 1 Playoffs. Yorkshire had to travel up to Scotland and could have ended the game early on through default, as East Kilbride failed to have an ambulance present when the game kicked off which resulted in the game being stopped early in the first quarter. Yorkshire however waited 45 minutes for the ambulance to arrive in the name of sportsmanship. Throughout the game both teams led however it was Yorkshire who had edged ahead going into the last quarter by 14 - 12. East Kilbride, as they did twice in the season, found an extra gear and pulled ahead of the Yorkshire side by 14 - 26. The Yorkshire Rams ended their season on a high losing to the eventual Division 1 Champions; East Kilbride Pirates.
Although the Yorkshire Rams were defeated in the Quarter Final of the playoffs their national ranking made them eligible for inclusion into the newly formed Northern Premiership. 2012 will see the Yorkshire Rams compete in the top flight of American Football in the UK along with the East Kilbride Pirates, Doncaster Mustangs, the Birmingham Bulls, Leicester Falcons and the Tamworth Phoenix

The Bible's Buried Secrets

"The Bible's Buried Secrets" is the title of a "NOVA" program that stirred controversy even before its first airing on PBS, on November 18, 2008. According to the program's official website: "The film presents the latest archeological scholarship from the Holy Land to explore the beginnings of modern religion and the origins of the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Old Testament. This archeological detective story tackles some of the biggest questions in biblical studies: Where did the ancient Israelites come from? Who wrote the Bible, when, and why? How did the worship of one God—the foundation of modern Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—emerge?"
Contents.
The producers surveyed the evidence and take positions that are mainstream among archaeologists and historians, although they continue to raise objections among both Christians who believe in the bible as literal truth and minimalists who assert that the Bible has no historical validation.
The program airs archaeologists' assertions that:
Reviews and reception.
The Biblical Archaeology Review wrote: ""The producers have done a magnificent job summarizing over a century of biblical archaeology and biblical scholarship in two hours. The film strikes a balance between the old-fashioned biblical archaeology approach, which tried to prove the Bible’s historicity, and the extreme skepticism of some minimalists, for whom the Bible contains little factual history.""
According to Rabbi Wesley Gardenswartz: ""Conservative Judaism is fully accepting of the type of scholarship featured in this documentary.""
Reverend Kenneth Himes says: ""For some, the ideas presented may seem novel or surprising, but this is material that is being discussed in the theology courses found at many Catholic universities.""
The conservative American Family Association has issued an online petition urging Congress to cut off federal funding for PBS. ""PBS is knowingly choosing to insult and attack Christianity by airing a program that declares the Bible ‘isn't true and a bunch of stories that never happened,’"" signers of the petition are encouraged to declare to members of Congress.
Apologetics Press, a young earth creationist organization affiliated with the Churches of Christ, has written a response to this program that is summarised with the concluding paragraph: "... if Christians are to change their minds about the historicity of the events recorded in the Hebrew Bible, a better case, supported by adequate evidence, would have to be made than the one presented in The Bible’s Buried Secrets."

Tuvia Friling

Tuvia Friling (born 7 May 1953) is a senior researcher at the Ben-Gurion Research Institute for the Study of Israel and Zionism and teaches at the Israel Studies Program and the Jewish history Department at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.
Biography and early academic career.
Tuvia Friling's parents with his elder brother and two sisters immigrated to Israel in 1951 from Bârlad, Romania. Arriving in Israel, the family, which had been prosperous in Romania, was first housed in a maabara (transit camp for new immigrants) in Beer Sheba. A year later they moved to a small apartment in a new neighborhood of the developing town. Tuvia Friling was born in Beer Sheba in 1953, two years after his family's arrival in Israel. In 1967, after completing elementary school in his hometown, he enrolled in the Jerusalem May Boyer boarding school for gifted students.
In 1971 he was drafted into the army and served as a squad commander in the 890 Paratroopers Battalion. In August 1973 he completed officer training and was deployed as platoon commander in the Golani Brigade's training base. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War he participated in two attempts to re-capture Mount Hermon, and fought in other battles on the Golan Heights. During the attrition war that followed and until the end of his regular military service he was deputy company commander in Golani. He continued to do reserve duty, eventually rising to the rank of major.
Friling received his B.A. with honors at the Ben-Gurion University in 1979 in Jewish and General History. For the four following years, 1979–1983, he taught history at a Beer-Sheba High School and worked as instructor for the teaching of history at Ben-Gurion University's teacher training program. He did his graduate studies at the Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, where he completed his Masters degree with honors in 1984 (the topic of his thesis was "Ben-Gurion's Role in the Rescue Attempts of Children and in the Absorption Controversy") and received his Ph.D. in 1991 (the topic of his dissertation was "Ben-Gurion and the Destruction of European Jewry 1939–1945"). Both dissertations were supervised by Prof. Yehuda Bauer.
Prizes.
Tuvia Friling was awarded the 1999 Mordechai Ish Shalom Prize for his book "Arrows in the Dark: David Ben-Gurion, the Yishuv leadership, and rescue attempts during the Holocaust"; in 2001 he received the Prime Minister's Prize – the most prominent Prize awarded by the State Council for the Commemoration of Presidents and Prime Ministers.
Additional Prizes: the David Tuviahu Prize of Yad Ben-Gurion; the Esther Parnas Prize of Yad Vashem, Jerusalem; the Denis Blum Prize of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; the Fridan Prize of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem; the Hillel Kook Memorial Prize of the Institute for Mediterranean Affairs.
Academic positions and professional career.
Friling began his academic career at Ben-Gurion University in 1977 as an instructor and research assistant, and has been teaching at the university ever since. During 1983–1991 he was a researcher at the Ben-Gurion Research Center as well as the director of the Ben-Gurion Archives. During 1993–2001 he served as director of the Ben-Gurion Heritage Institute and the Ben-Gurion Research Center in the University's Sde Boqer Campus. He initiated and in cooperation with the University's Computation center, established the digitalized Ben-Gurion Archive – a world class computerized archive and database that provides online access using full text retrieval software. For his accomplishments as the head of the Ben-Gurion institutes he was awarded the Prime Minister's Prize.
In the years 2001–2004 Friling served as Israel's State Archivist. In this position he initiated a master plan for upgrading Israel's archives system. The program's mainstays were: the construction of permanent quarters in Jerusalem housing the State Archives; the creation of a central modern storage center in the Negev for the archival holdings; the computerization of the State Archives and the creation of a computerized network of all Israel's public archives; the creation of the infrastructure and organization for the preservation of the State of Israel's computerized documentation and its conversion with the advent of new technological generations; the updating of the Israeli Archives' Law, shortening of the classification period, changes in the practice of destruction of the documentation in order to expand and enrich the quantity and variety of documentation that is preserved for perpetuity; and the establishment of a national Authority for Archives and Public Records.
In the years 2003–2004 Friling was one the three co-vice chairs of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania, chaired by Nobel Prize Laureate Elie Wiesel.
Friling was a visiting scholar in various academic institutes in Israel and abroad: 1992–1993 at the Meyerhoff Center for Hebrew and Jewish Studies at University of Maryland, College Park; 1996 at the Center for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, Yarnton, Oxford; 1999–2000 at the International Institute for Holocaust Research, Yad Vashem, Jerusalem and the Yitzhak Rabin Center, Tel Aviv; 2002–2004 at the Shalem Center, Jerusalem; 2006–2007 at the Center of Advanced Holocaust Studies, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington DC; 2007–2008 at the Gildenhorn Institute for Israel Studies, University of Maryland.
Friling serves on the editorial boards of several academic journals: "Iyunim Bitkumat Israel - Studies in Zionism", "the Yishuv and the State of Israel", published by the Ben-Gurion Research Institute; "Israel Studies", published by the Ben-Gurion Research Institute and Brandeis University; and "Shvut", published by the Diaspora Research Center of Tel Aviv University and the Ben-Gurion Research Institute.
Research interests.
Friling's research interest focuses on the Zionist leadership's role in the nation building processes in the pre-state Yishuv and the State of Israel, as well as on David Ben-Gurion's leadership during that period and the ensemble of his decision making and strategic moves before and after the establishment of the State of Israel. In addition, Friling explored the Yishuv leadership's role in rescue attempts during the Holocaust and the impact of these issues on questions pertaining to Israeli identity. His book "Arrows in the Dark—David Ben-Gurion, the Yishuv leadership, and rescue attempts during the Holocaust" (University of Wisconsin–Madison, 2005) analyzes the Yishuv's rescue efforts during the Holocaust and provides a detailed account of the scope and complexities of the activities carried out by David Ben-Gurion and the Yishuv leadership during that period.
Friling also dealt with post-Zionism and the roots of the controversy between so-called new historians and critical sociologists and "establishment" historians and sociologists.
His article: The Seventh Million as the Zionist Movement's March of Folly, was published in 1992 and was among the first attempts to grapple with this controversy. Further contributions to this debate were an article he co-authored with Yehuda Bauer, that was published in Iton 77, and a comprehensive book he edited, entitled An Answer to a Post-Zionist Colleague – a compilation of articles by various researchers shedding light on different perspectives of this issue.
Friling also dealt with the historical and ideological roots of the debate about Israel's social and economic policy in recent years, and together with Daniel Gutwein and Avi Bareli edited a two volume publication Society and Economy in Israel: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives.
Tuvia Friling was among Israel's pioneers in the development of computerized full-text databases of historical documentation based on modern retrieval systems. The digitalized online archive he created with his partners at the Ben-Gurion Research Institute in Sde Boqer provides scholars with unprecedented research opportunities. Friling also developed teaching methods for teaching history in a research environment and by means of computerized online settings.
This program served as the foundation for scores of teacher training courses entitled "The Expedition to the Isle of Story".
Friling is at present engaged in researching the activities of the Yishuv's right-wing circles during the Holocaust in illegal immigration, aid and rescue, as well as their clandestine cooperation with American, British and other intelligence services, and their post World War II involvement in illegal immigration and the building of an armed force.
Who Are You Leon Berger? A story of a Kapo in Auschwitz, History, Memory and Politics.
This book (Hebrew, Resling, 2009, 667 pp.) attempts to unravel the historical, political, and psychological forces that underlay the tragedy of a young Polish Jew, Eliezer Grynbaum (1908–1948), who was denounced as a Kapo for the role he played while interned at Auschwitz during the Holocaust. Eliezer Grynbaum, who adopted the nom de guerre "Leon Berger" while fighting in the Spanish Civil War, was the communist son of Itzhak Grynbaum, the most prominent secular leader of interwar Polish Jewry, who later became the chairman of the Jewish Agency Executive's Rescue Committee during the Holocaust, and the State of Israel's first Minister of the Interior. Eliezer Grynbaum's life story encompasses the tensions and tragedies of modern Jewish history— a Jewish community torn between Communism, Bundist socialism, Zionism, and ultra-Orthodoxy, and deeply battered by the deliberate Nazi attempt to eradicate it. By locating the biography of Eliezer Grynbaum within the varied cultural and political contexts in which he operated, the book brings to life the heart-wrenching debates that rent the Jewish community in Europe and Israel from the 1930s through the 1960s. It recreates not only the horrible dilemmas he confronted, but the Rashamon-like struggle over his memory, with radically different accounts by the family who loved him, the communist movement that disowned him, the ultra-Orthodox community that despised him, and the Zionist establishment that struggled to find a place for the wayward son of one of its leading politicians.
Eliezer was the second son of Itzhak and Miriam Grynbaum. His father was the most important Zionist politician in interwar Poland, which had the largest, most culturally vibrant, and most politically fragmented Jewish community in the world. The father was a champion of a secular, nationalist conception of Jewishness, whose major opponents included the communists — who sought to overcome Jewish particularity through universalist revolution — and the Ultra-Orthodox, who condemned the Zionists as heretics for their attempt to establish a Jewish state. As was often the case, the political and cultural tensions ran within families as well. So it was with the Grynbaums.
Eliezer began to study law, but was arrested in 1929 by the Polish secret police on account of his clandestine activity in the Communist Party. Following his trial, conviction and incarceration in the prison of Leczyca, his mother used the family's connection to Poland's political leadership to obtain his release after two and a half years in prison, on the condition that he leave the country. Young Grynbaum emigrated to France, where he became an activist in the Polish cell of the French Communist Party and a journalist for the communist press. As a communist, he joined the International Brigade and served in the Spanish Civil War. After the Brigade was disbanded, he returned to France where, with other suspect foreigners, he was confined to the detention camp at Saint Cyprien, while his mother struggled to use her connections to legalize his status in France. Continued involvement in the French Communist Party led to his arrest in Paris in the first years of the German occupation. He was subsequently interned in Beaune-la-Rolande, where he became the leader of the camp's inmates.
In June 1942, Eliezer was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. As was often the case, the communists in the camp tried to place their own members in privileged positions in the inmate hierarchy. Grynbaum became Blockaelteste (block elder) in Birkenau, earning him the epithet of Kapo. His role there was to become a matter of bitter contention. He acted with brutality toward some inmates, but whether his deeds were born of cruelty or, as he later argued, a strategic necessity under the morally intolerable conditions of the camp, remained a matter of dispute. As the Allied forces approached, Grynbaum and his fellow inmates were forcibly marched to Buchenwald in one of the infamous death marches. Immediately after the liberation, Grynbaum was twice put on trial at Buchenwald by a tribunal of inmates for his role in the camps. In both cases he was acquitted on the grounds of inconclusive evidence. On the orders of the Polish Communist Party, he returned to Paris as its representative. There, a judicial inquiry by the Polish Communist Party found him guilty of having been a Kapo and expelled him from the party. Next, the charges against him were investigated by a French juge d'instruction (examining magistrate). His friends and his father (by now a prominent official in the Zionist movement's quasi-government in Palestine) struggled to ensure that Grynbaum's side of the story was heard by the investigators, and the case was dismissed for insufficient evidence. Now Eliezer Grynbaum became a man without a country or a party. The government of France ordered his expulsion as an undesirable alien, but the ruling communist government of Poland, embarrassed by its association with a man increasingly stigmatized as a Nazi collaborator, refused his request to return to Poland. So Grynbaum, who had rejected Zionism throughout his adult life, was forced to seek refuge in the only place that would have him. Accompanied by his father, Eliezer arrived in Palestine on 1 May 1946. 
There he made repeated attempts to explain his role at Auschwitz to the skeptical officials of the Zionist government of the Yishuv (Jewish community in Palestine). Still a committed communist, Eliezer sought once more to return to Poland, and was again denied entry by the Polish party. He struggled to build a new life with Stefa, a childhood friend and fellow survivor of Auschwitz. When the fledgling State of Israel came under attack, Eliezer, perhaps under paternal pressure, volunteered to join the Israeli defense forces, but rumors of his role as a Kapo led the army to reject him. Once again his father intervened, and Eliezer was permitted to enlist and join in the defense of Jerusalem. On 22 May 1948 he fell in the battle of Kibbutz Ramat Rachel, on the outskirts of the city. By evening, there were rumors that Eliezer had been executed by his comrades, in revenge for his role in Auschwitz. On learning of his death, Stefa committed suicide. The Grynbaum family grappled with the rumors about his execution and struggled to rehabilitate his reputation.
In the decades that followed his death, the public memory of Eliezer Grynbaum became a recurrent point of tension in Israeli political culture. His case was cited in the Knesset debates regarding the passage in 1951 of the "law against collaboration". His father, Itzhak, used up a great deal of his political capital to have Eliezer included in Scrolls of Fire, the prestigious memorial volume devoted to the fallen heroes of the War of Independence. The perceived pressure exerted by Itzhak Grynbaum on the volume's editors damaged his own reputation. In one of the most famous early Israeli Holocaust memoirs, Piepel (translated into English as Atrocity) by KaZetnik (the pen name of Yehiel Dinur), Eliezer served as the model for Fruchtenbaum, a loathsome Kapo and persecutor of orthodox Jews. This, in turn, led to a new uproar in the Israeli press over Grynbaum's inclusion in Scrolls of Fire, at the same time as ultra-Orthodox circles began a campaign against Itzhak Grynbaum, the secular Zionist father tainted by association with his Kapo son.
The cultural swings of the Grynbaum family came full circle when a younger Eliezer Grynbaum, Itzhak's grandson and the son of Eliezer's brother (named in memory of his uncle), came under the influence of the ultra-Orthodox and rabidly anti-Zionist rabbi and publicist Menachem Grilak, one of Itzhak's most implacable foes. The defection of the scion of the Grynbaum family to its ideological adversaries was trumpeted by the ultra-Orthodox press.
Finally, the book discusses whether the competing narratives of Grynbaum's life can be reconciled, and ends by answering the question, "Who, really, was Eliezer Grynbaum/Leon Berger?
This is a story that spans four decades—from the mid-1920s until the mid-1960s—and many countries: Poland, France, Spain, Germany, and Israel. It is based on a wide variety of documentation uncovered by the author in Israeli archives, as well as on the records of Grynbaum's two post-war trials (the Polish Communist Party tribunal and the French investigation), and a diary written by Eliezer Grynbaum after the war describing his experience in Auschwitz, a document now in the possession of the Grynbaum family. These unique sources reveal a different aspect of Eliezer Grynbaum's character and camp record, highlighting his participation in the underground resistance in the death camp rather than his alleged ill-treatment of orthodox Jews while serving as a Kapo. This documentation records his sometimes courageous activity to save his communist comrades and other inmates in the camp. The heroic components of this saga were expropriated by his erstwhile communist comrades, who, for political and other reasons that are described in detail in the book, expunged him from the collective memory of their movement, even as they appropriated for themselves his role as a courageous resistance fighter.
The book presents a Rashomon-like account of four main narratives – the communist, the ultra-Orthodox, the Zionist, and the familial – and their battle for hegemony. It shows why Eliezer Grynbaum's story provided such fertile ground for abuse and manipulation by the communists on the one hand, and the ultra-Orthodox on the other. For Grynbaum was at once a Jewish Kapo, a communist, an anti-Zionist, a secularist, and the son of a polarizing Zionist leader. As such, Eliezer became a symbol to be exploited by opponents of the movements to which he was linked. Thus all attempts by the family to rehabilitate his name both after the war and after his death were in vain.
The book grapples with the ultimately unanswerable questions posed by Eliezer Grynbaum's life. Was he a Macbeth-like hero, a villain, who at the same time was a tragic figure? Did he succumb to the temptations of his privileged position in Auschwitz, or was he an honorable member of the resistance? Was his chief motivation as block-elder—a role his friends had asked him to assume — self-interest, or was he acting out of concern for his fellow inmates? Was there a sinister aspect to his character that coexisted with his native charm and charisma? Was he right in claiming he had been unjustly stripped of his heroic deeds, leaving him only with the stain of his collaboration? Where lies the truth and where the fabrication in Eliezer's and his friends' version of his past? Would his fate have been different – even if he had done what is claimed – had he not been the son of so prominent a Zionist leader? And, last but not least, was there an unbreachable gap of experience between him and his accusers in post-war Poland, France, and Israel, who were unable to imagine the moral ambiguities of his position in Auschwitz? For Grynbaum may well have been the first to place before a larger public the issue of the inevitability of collaboration and its inexorable dilemmas.

Delta Consolidated Mining Company

The Delta Consolidated Mining Company was an American mining company that operated a gold mine in Shasta County, California. A narrow-gage railroad connecting the mine to the nearby town of Delta, California operated for several decades.
History of the mine.
The company owned and operated the Delta gold mine, in the Dog Creek mining district, about seven miles west of Delta, on Upper Dog Creek. A stamp mill was erected on Dog Creek, near the mine. The orebodies were narrow quartz veins in greenstone, containing free gold and sulfide minerals.
History of the narrow-gage railroad.
In 1902 a 36-inch gauge railroad was constructed from the Southern Pacific transfer at Delta Station to the stamp mill some 6.5 miles away. In the middle 1880s, Delta had been 
the terminus of the California and Oregon Railroad, later absorbed by the Central Pacific. 
A switchback was used to ascend to the flat table land above Delta, and from there the line pursued a gradual grade west on the north side of Dog Creek, maintaining elevation until the creek rose to meet it about 2 miles from the mill site. From here on, the grade was right at creekside.
For many years a Climax, called "The Doctor", was used for power and the only other equipment seems to have been a single flatcar upon which sacked ore was shipped to Delta for transfer to Southern Pacific. They were then taken to the smelters at Kennet and Coram for further processing. Today both of these towns are under Shasta Lake.
Operations on the line were infrequent, and ceased altogether in the early 1920s. The property fell into the hands of Cash Elder, who had been a mining engineer, and arrangements were made to dispose of the railroad. The locomotive apparently went to South America along with some rail in about 1928. The rest of the railroad remained largely intact until 1941 when it was pulled up for scrap.
Today nearly the entire right of way can be traced winding alongside and just below the present Dog Creek Road.

The Souther-Hillman-Furay Band is the debut album by The Souther-Hillman-Furay Band, released in 1974. It peaked at number 11 on the Billboard 200 chart.
History.
The Souther-Hillman-Furay Band was a country rock supergroup led by singer-songwriters Richie Furay, Chris Hillman, and J.D. Souther. The band was formed in 1973 upon the request of David Geffen, then head of Asylum Records. The group had a substantial hit with the 1974 self-titled first album and the single "Fallin' in Love" reached No. 27 in the U.S. It was reissued on CD by the Wounded Bird label in 2002.
Reception.
In his review for Allmusic, critic Brett Hartenbach wrote "despite high expectations along with the history of their members, the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band's 1974 eponymous debut never quite lived up to its promise. The trio... delivers a collection of ten pleasant, if overall unremarkable tunes in the singer/songwriter, country-rock vein. There are glimmers of past glories by each, but only Furay really connects solidly... there should be enough here—thanks especially to the Furay tracks—that will at least be of moderate interest to most fans."

Quercus ilicifolia

Quercus ilicifolia, commonly known as Bear Oak or Scrub Oak, is a small shrubby oak native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.
This oak is a deciduous tree or shrub growing up to 6 to 8 meters tall. It is "gangly" and can form a dense thicket. The plant grows from a large taproot which can be up to 20 centimeters thick. The taproot lives a long time, producing several generations of aboveground parts. The alternately arranged leaves are each up to 15 centimeters long by 10 wide. The species is monoecious, with plants bearing both male catkins and solitary or clustered female flowers. The egg-shaped acorn is 1 to 2 centimeters long with a saucer-shaped cap. The plant reproduces sexually by seed and vegetatively by sprouting new stems.
This oak is a dominant plant species in a number of regions and habitat types. In Maine it can be found in deciduous forests alongside red maple ("Acer rubrum"), gray birch ("Betula populifolia"), and quaking aspen ("Populus tremuloides"). In Massachusetts it codominates with black huckleberry ("Gaylussacia baccata") on the shrublands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. At Cape Cod it occurs with pitch pine ("Pinus rigida") and broom crowberry ("Corema conradii"). It can be found on the Pine Barrens of New Jersey and pine barrens habitat on Long Island. It also occurs in fire barrens on granite and gneiss further north in Canada. This oak is adapted to disturbance in the habitat, such as wildfire. Hence, it does not tolerate shade and it requires disturbance to clear remove other plant species so it can receive sunlight. It sprouts prolifically after fire burns away its aboveground parts.
This plant provides food and shelter for many animal species. Bears consume the acorns, especially when preparing for hibernation. White-tailed deer eat the acorns and the stems and foliage. Many types of squirrels cache the acorns. Many birds depend on them; Wild Turkeys prefer them over other types of food. A large number of insect species live on the oak. This oak species is the main food plant for 29% of the rare or endangered Lepidopterans in southern New England and southeastern New York.
This oak has been used in revegetation projects on the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island.
This oak is also known to rocky summits in the Piedmont of North Carolina where it is listed as a State Endangered Plant.

Khmelnitskiy Nuclear Power Plant

The Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant is a nuclear power plant in Netishyn, Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine. The plant is operated by Energoatom. Two VVER-1000 reactors are operational, each generating 1000 MW (net) of electricity. Construction of the first reactor started in 1981 and the first unit was put in operation in late 1987. Construction of the second reactor started in 1983 with plans to finish it in 1991. In 1990, however, construction was stopped as part of a moratorium on new plant construction. Construction was completed only in August 2004 after the moratorium was lifted.
Two reactors are currently under construction. Construction of the third reactor started in September 1985 and the fourth reactor in June 1986. Construction was stopped in 1990 when they were 75% and 28% complete, respectively. An intergovernmental agreement on the resumption of construction was signed between Ukraine and Russia in June 2010. On 10 February 2011, Energoatom and Atomstroyexport signed a contract agreement for the completion of reactors 3 and 4. They should be commissioned in 2018 and 2020, respectively.. Feasibility study of reactors 3 and 4 was conducted by Kiev Institute Energoproekt.
Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant is the start of the 750kV-powerline Widelka-Khmelnytskyi, one of three 750 kV lines running from Ukraine to the European Union.

32d Flying Training Squadron

The 32d Flying Training Squadron (32 FTS) was last part of the 71st Flying Training Wing based at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. It operated T-1 Jayhawk aircraft conducting flight training. It was inactivated for unknown reasons on 14 September 2012.
History.
Activated in late 1942 under I Troop Carrier Command and equipped with C-47 Skytrains. Trained in various parts of the eastern United States until the end of 1943. Deployed to French Morocco in May 1943 and assigned to Twelfth Air Force to support combat operations in the North African Campaign. Remained with Twelfth Air Force, moving to Tunisia and Sicily providing transport and resupply operations as well as casualty evacuation of wounded personnel in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO). Reassigned to IX Troop Carrier Command, Ninth Air Force in England during early 1944 as part of the build-up of Allied forces prior to the D-Day invasion of France.
Began operations by dropping paratroops into Normandy on D-Day (6 June 1944) and releasing gliders with reinforcements on the following day. The unit received a Distinguished Unit Citation and a French citation for these missions. 
After the Normandy invasion the squadron ferried supplies in the United Kingdom. The squadron also hauled food, clothing, medicine, gasoline, ordnance equipment, and other supplies to the front lines and evacuated patients to rear zone hospitals. It dropped paratroops near Nijmegen and towed gliders carrying reinforcements during the airborne attack on Holland. In December, it participated in the Battle of the Bulge by releasing gliders with supplies for the 101st Airborne Division near Bastogne. 
Moved to Belgium in early 1945, and participated in the Western Allied invasion of Germany, participating in the air assault across the Rhine River in March 1945, each aircraft towed two gliders with troops of the 17th Airborne Division and released them near Wesel.
After V-E Day, became part of the United States Air Forces in Europe, being assigned to AAF Station Frankfurt and was part of the USAFE European Air Transport System (EATS), supporting the occupation forces in Germany as well as carrying supplies and personnel between various stations in Western Europe. Inactivated on 30 September 1946 in Germany. 
The squadron conducted worldwide airlift operations between 1973 and 1979 and provided pilot training from 1995-2012. Due to a lack of a relevant mission for a lesser known sister squadron, the 32d was inactivated in an attempt to save the heritage of the 3rd Fighter Training Squadron. The 32d was officially inactivated on 14 Sep 2012 despite the fact that it was consistently ranked the base's top squadron in athletics, pilot production, morale, and other metrics.

<doc id="20002436" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20002436" title="HCNH+">
HCNH+

HCNH+, also known as protonated hydrogen cyanide, is a molecular ion of astrophysical interest.
Structure.
The ground state structure of HCNH+ is a simple linear molecule. In addition, there are multiple higher energy isomers such as CNH2+, H2CN+, "cis" -HCNH+, and "trans" -HCNH+.
Laboratory studies.
As a relatively simple molecular ion, HCNH+ has been extensively studied in the laboratory. The very first spectrum taken at any wavelength focused on the ν2 (CH stretch) ro-vibrational band in the infrared.
Soon afterward, the same authors reported on their investigation of the ν1 (NH stretch) band.
Following these initial studies, several groups published manuscripts on the various ro-vibrational spectra of HCNH+, including studies of the ν3 band (CN stretch)
the ν4 band (HCN bend)
and the ν5 band (HNC bend)
While all of these studies focused on ro-vibrational spectra in the infrared, it was not until 1998 that technology advanced far enough for an investigation of the pure rotational spectrum of HCNH+ in the microwave region to take place. At that time, microwave spectra for HCNH+ and its isotopomers HCND+ and DCND+ were published
Recently, the pure rotational spectrum of HCNH+ was measured again in order to more precisely determine the molecular rotational constants "B" and "D"
Spectrum.
As mentioned above, the most recent laboratory measurement of the pure rotational spectrum of the ground state of HCNH+ was performed in 2006. This study determined the most precise values of the molecular constants to date. Using these constants in conjunction with the program PGOPHER, one can generate the predicted rotational spectrum for the ground state of HCNH+ at a temperature of 30 K, as shown below. Being a linear molecule, HCNH+ follows the basic rotational selection rule of Δ"J"=±1.
Formation and destruction.
According to the database at astrochemistry.net, the most advanced chemical models of HCNH+ include 71 total formation reactions and 21 total destruction reactions. Of these, however, only a handful dominate the overall formation and destruction. In the case of formation, the 7 dominant reactions are:
H3+ + HCN → HCNH+ + H2
H3+ + HNC → HCNH+ + H2
HCO+ + HCN → HCNH+ + CO
HCO+ + HNC → HCNH+ + CO
H3O+ + HCN → HCNH+ + H2O
H3O+ + HNC → HCNH+ + H2O
C+ + NH3 → HCNH+ + H
Using rate coefficients from astrochemistry.net and the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry in conjunction with model interstellar abundances
one can calculate the relative importance of these 7 reactions as shown in the table below.
Being an ion, HCNH+ is predominantly destroyed by the electron recombination reactions:
e- + HCNH+ → HCN + H
e- + HCNH+ → HNC + H
e- + HCNH+ → CN + H + H
Using the same sources as above, the relative importance of these destruction reactions are calculated and shown in the table below. Also shown in the table is the ion-neutral reaction HCNH+ + H2CO, in order to demonstrate just how dominant electron recombination is.
Astronomical detections.
Initial interstellar detection.
HCNH+ was first detected in interstellar space in 1986 toward the dense cloud Sgr B2 using the NRAO 12 m dish and the Texas Millimeter Wave Observatory.
These observations utilized the "J"=1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 pure rotational transitions at 74, 148, and 222 GHz, respectively.
Subsequent interstellar detections.
Since the initial detection, HCNH+ has also been observed in TMC-1
as well as DR 21(OH)
. The initial detection toward Sgr B2 has also been confirmed. All 3 of these sources are dense molecular clouds, and to date HCNH+ has not been detected in diffuse interstellar material.
Solar System bodies.
While not directly detected via spectroscopy, the existence of HCNH+ has in fact been inferred in the atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. This was done using the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) instrument aboard the Cassini space probe. Models of Titan's atmosphere had predicted that HCNH+ would be the dominant ion present, and a strong peak in the mass spectrum at Z/M=28 seems to support this theory.
In 1997, observations were made of the long-period comet Hale-Bopp in an attempt to find HCNH+,

Jarrow School

Jarrow School is a secondary school located in Jarrow, Tyne and Wear admitting pupils aged 11 to 16.
History.
It was opened on 6 January 2003 following the merger of Springfield Comprehensive and Hedworthfield Comprehensive, and is based at the old Springfield site. Its full title is "Jarrow School, Excellence In Engineering", the result of a competition to choose an inspirational name for the new school. In 2007 the school became a specialist Engineering College.
The former Jarrow Grammar School opened in 1911. In June 2010, this building was demolished.
In October 2013 the school's headteacher Sir Kenneth Gibson became the first person to be knighted by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. 
Springfield.
Springfield was Jarrow's grammar school and was formerly known as "Jarrow Grammar School".It became a comprehensive school in 1975 to cater for all prospective pupils' academic abilities, in common with the other schools in the area including Hedworthfield. 
Hedworthfield.
Hedworthfield was designated as a complementary secondary modern school to Springfield's provision as the local grammar school. It was a newer development built in the 1960s at Fellgate on the outskirts of Jarrow. Extensive building work was completed in the late 1970s providing the school with better facilities for arts and crafts, a music and drama studio, a community centre and a sports complex containing badminton and squash courts, a gym and other facilities. 
Alongside Springfield, it was converted to a comprehensive school in 1978. However, following its redesignation, some parents still insisted on sending their children to Springfield, even though they were no longer in its catchment area; they cited concerns that an ex-secondary modern school might not measure up to the same academic standards as the former grammar school. Additionally, Hedworthfield had no provision for teaching 6th form pupils, meaning that those choosing to study subjects at A-level had to relocate once they had completed their O-levels or GCSEs. Generally, 6th form students opted to transfer to Springfield to continue their education.
Merger.
Following the dwindling number of pupils for the new intake year-on-year, it became apparent that continuing to fund the running of both schools in parallel was no longer viable, so a merger into a single school was proposed. After some debate as to whether it should be on one of the existing sites, or an entirely new site funded by a Private Finance Initiative, the decision was taken to locate the merged school at the Springfield campus.
Controversy.
Pupils and parents from both Hedworthfield and Springfield were unhappy about the proposal to merge them into a single school. There was much additional criticism because of the timing, coming as soon as it did after investment at the Hedworthfield site and the uncertainty surrounding the future of its new special needs unit for autistic children. However, the merger went ahead, resulting in the relocation of the Hedworthfield pupils to the Springfield site.
Hedworthfield's OFSTED results were surpassing those of the historically more academic Springfield for some time prior to the merger. Students at both schools protested, and more than 100 pupils at Jarrow School were involved in a "near riot" during the summer of 2003, during which police made three arrests.
New building.
The old Jarrow School building has been replaced by a new school on the same site, funded by Building Schools for the Future. The old school was a built during the reign of Queen Victoria (Victorian Era) and by the millennium was in serious need of either refurbishment or a re-build. It was then decided that the old school was to be demolished and replaced with a modern new school which was funded by Building Schools for the Future scheme and designed by Inspired Spaces. The new building has an outstanding learning environment with light, airy rooms and thriving with high class facilities.
Academic performance.
GCSE results were below the national average. The school was not known to concentrate on the more crucial subjects like Maths and English. Results for these subjects were poor, around 40%. However, this year's (2012) results show a significant increase in achievement with 97% of mainstream students gained 5A*-Cs and 57% of students who accessed the mainstream curriculum gained 5A*-Cs including English and maths, a significant increase of over 7% on last year’s figure. There is only one school in South Tyneside LEA has a sixth form, and A-levels are available at the South Tyneside College.

Six-year itch

The six-year itch, according to political scientists, is the pattern which takes place during a US president's sixth year in office. This year is characterized by the nation's disgruntled attitude towards the president and his political party. During this time, there is a midterm election and the party in power usually loses a significant number of seats in Congress.
Prior to Reconstruction, the six-year itch saw the President's party gain seats in one house, while losing seats in the other house. Presidents before Reconstruction whose party had this occur:
1814 - James Madison: Gained 5 seats in the House, but lost 2 seats in the Senate.
1822 - James Monroe: Gained 34 seats in the House, but lost 1 seat in the Senate.
1834 - Andrew Jackson: Lost 2 seats in the House, but gained 1 seat in the Senate.
Thomas Jefferson was the only two-term President before Reconstruction not to have this occur. In 1806, his party gained 2 seats in the House and gained 1 seat in the Senate. Also, the Republican party saw strong gains in the midterms of 1866, although President Abraham Lincoln had been assassinated shortly after his reelection two years prior, and Andrew Johnson of the Democratic Party was President at the time: The Republicans gained 40 seats in the House, and gained 18 seats in the Senate.
After Reconstruction, the six-year itch saw the President's party consistently lose seats in both houses. Presidents since Reconstruction whose party had this occur:
1874 - Ulysses S. Grant: Lost 93 seats in the House*, lost 1 seat in the Senate.
1894 - Grover Cleveland (although this was his second term, it was not consecutive with his first): Lost 107 seats in the House*, lost 4 seats in the Senate*.
1918 - Woodrow Wilson: Lost 22 seats in the House*, lost 5 seats in the Senate*.
1938 - Franklin D. Roosevelt: Lost 72 seats in the House, lost 7 seats in the Senate.
1950 - Harry S. Truman: Lost 28 seats in the House, lost 5 seats in the Senate.
1958 - Dwight D. Eisenhower: Lost 48 seats in the House, lost 13 seats in the Senate.
1974 - Richard Nixon (although Gerald Ford was the President when the elections took place that year): Lost 48 seats in the House, lost 4 seats in the Senate. 
1986 - Ronald Reagan: Lost 5 seats in the House, lost 8 seats in the Senate*.
2006 - George W. Bush: Lost 30 seats in the House*, lost 6 seats in the Senate*.
Bill Clinton is the only two-term President since Reconstruction not to have this occur. In 1998, his party gained 5 seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate was unchanged.

Albert "Al" Rooney (1892-?) was an American gang leader and founder of the Fourteenth Street Gang. One of the independent gangs allied with Monk Eastman, most of them former members of the Humpty Jackson gang, Rooney led the group from the mid-to late 1900s (decade) until the New York City Police Department launched a four-year citywide campaign to break up the countless street gangs operating in the city between 1910 and 1914. Rooney was one of the first gang leaders to be imprisoned and, with his conviction of second degree murder in 1911, is considered one of the last generation gang captains of the "Gangs of New York" period.
In June 1911, he was tried for the murder of a Dominick Martello with whom he had gotten into an alterication with at a dance at the Stuyvessant Casino held by the Harry J. Callahan Association three months earlier. Martello was alleged to have assaulted him and Rooney left to get a revolver. He returned a short time later and ambushed him in the hallway of the casino shooting him three times in the back. One of the bullets severed Martello's spinal cord, however he later died from his wounds. Rooney was one of several criminals to be prosecuted by District Attorney's Frank Moss and Edward R. O'Malley with William Jones, Biff Ellison and Johnny Spanish being tried that same week. He was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to serve between twenty years and life imprisonment in Sing Sing. His sentence was later commuted to eight years by Governor Al Smith due to the recommendation of District Attorney Charles D. Newton on account of Rooney's age at the time of his conviction. He was officially released on parole on June 27, 1919.

Raggedy Ann and Andy in The Great Santa Claus Caper

Raggedy Ann and Andy in The Great Santa Claus Caper, a.k.a. simply The Great Santa Claus Caper, is a 1978 animated American television special featuring Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy.
Synopsis.
Inventor and efficiency expert Alexander Graham Wolf (Les Tremayne), who looks and sounds like Wile E. Coyote, is planning to take over Santa's workshop. Overhearing this, Comet (June Foray), one of Santa's reindeer, asks Raggedy Ann (Foray) and Andy (Daws Butler) and their dog Raggedy Arthur to help her because they're easy to carry and aren't bothered by cold weather.
At the factory, Alexander is using a machine to encase all the toys in blocks of a transparent and unbreakable substance called gloopstik, to ensure that they'll last forever (even though the children won't be able to play with them). He then intends to charge the children for the gloopstik-encased toys and become rich.
After arriving the Raggedies soon meet Alexander and he tries to interest them with his machine. At first Andy is intrigued by the idea, but Ann thinks that it's awful. However, when Alexander uses his machine to encase Arthur both Raggedies become angry. Andy demands that Alexander change their dog right back. Within minutes Alexander tries to do so to Andy and has the claw grab him and toss him in the machine while Ann furiously protests and orders Alexander to put Andy down. However, when he tries to do so to Ann, Andy (who is unharmed) climbs out of the top of the machine and when he sees Alexander chasing Ann, he gets really angry and takes control of the machine. He then encases Alexander in a Christmas tree-shaped block. Ann and Andy laugh until Alexander tells them that gloopstik is unbreakable. At which point they become really worried, and run, hug and tell Arthur that they still love him even though he's stuck. Then the block disintegrates and the Raggedys realize that love is the one thing that can destroy the gloopstik. Breaking the fourth wall, they ask all the children at home to shout "LOVE," which causes all the gloopstik blocks to fall apart, including the one in which Alexander's trapped. Having learned his lesson, Alexander destroys his machine (by pushing a button that causes it to consume itself) and leaves the workshop, just before Santa (Tremayne) wakes up.

Aqualate Mere

Aqualate Mere is the largest natural lake in the English Midlands and is managed as a National Nature Reserve (NNR) by Natural England. It is a remnant of the prehistoric Lake Lapworth.
The Mere lies within the borough of Stafford in Staffordshire, England, some 2 km east of the market town of Newport, Shropshire. It is within the grounds of Aqualate Hall, a country house, with a landscaped deer park.
Although large in extent (1.5 km long and 0.5 km wide), the Mere is remarkably shallow and is nowhere much more than one metre deep. Aqualate Mere is an example of an esker system (rare in the Midlands) formed by glacial meltwaters during the late Devensian glaciation, about 50,000 years ago. The depression in which the Mere lies, thought to be a kettle hole, and the surrounding higher ground which comprises glacial sand and gravel deposits were all formed at the same time.
It is fed by streams coming from the north, south and east (including Back Brook), and its outflow to the west forms the River Meese which joins the River Tern, a tributary of the River Severn.
The Mere supports diverse fish and bird populations, including large numbers of wintering and breeding wildfowl and breeding Eurasian Curlew and Common Snipe. Together with the surrounding land, it is also important for its botanical and invertebrate communities. Mammals found on the NNR include Polecat, Water Vole and Harvest Mouse, together with bats such as Pipistrelle, Daubenton's, Natterer's, Brandt's and Whiskered.
Its name came from Anglo-Saxon "Āc-gelād" = "oak grove".

Rudolf Köpke

Rudolf Köpke (August 23, 1813 - June 10, 1870) was a German historian who was a native of Königsberg.
Biography.
From 1832 he studied theology in Berlin, but his interest changed to history under the influence of Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886). With Georg Waitz (1813-1886), Wilhelm von Giesebrecht (1814-1889) and Siegfried Hirsch (1816-1860), he was an early member of the so-called "Ranke school" of historians. 
From 1838 to 1842, he taught classes at the Joachimsthalschen gymnasium in Berlin, subsequently becoming associated with the Monumenta Germaniae Historica. From 1850 to 1867, he taught history classes at the "Kriegsakademie" (War Academy of Berlin). He received the title of associate professor in 1856. 
During the March Revolution of 1848, he was an advocate for German unity, publishing a series of articles calling for the end of German Kleinstaaterei.
Literary works.
Among Köpke's written works was a highly regarded two-volume biography of poet Ludwig Tieck (1773-1853), published in 1855 with the title of "Ludwig Tieck. Erinnerungen aus dem Leben des Dichters nach dessen mündlichen und schriftlichen Mittheilungen". Other noted works by Köpke include:

José Jurado

José Jurado (1899–1971) was a professional golfer in the sport’s Golden Age. Born in Buenos Aires, he was the first Argentine to travel to major international championships and is thus often credited as the “Father of Argentine Professional Golf” or the “Godfather of Argentinean Golf.” He is perhaps best known for his losing stroke to Tommy Armour at the 1931 British Open at Carnoustie. Jurado was personal friends with the Prince of Wales, who was reportedly enraged by his double bogey that lost him the championship.
Career.
Jurado began his career as a caddie at The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. At the age of 21, he won his first of seven championships at the Argentine Open, and was also a seven-time winner of the Argentine PGA Championship. In 1932, Jurado traveled to the US, justifying these journeys as the only way to progress his skill as a professional golfer. After studying the operations of the American PGA, he undertook the organization of the AAPG (Asociación Argentina de Profesionales de Golf). Jurado also recruited international golf figures to teach Argentine enthusiasts the emerging and popular American-style swing. In 1931 he won an exhibition match against Aubrey Boomer in France. Jurado finished in the top ten in four majors: T8 at the British Open in 1926, T6 in the British Open in 1928, 2nd in the British Open in 1931 and T6 in the U.S. Open in 1932.
In literature.
Jurado is referenced in "The Book of Golfers: A Biographical History of the Royal & Ancient Game", by Daniel Wexler. The book is an encyclopedia of the most important golfers since the 15th century, and in it Jurado is described as “…a golfing pioneer in the truest sense, for while early British professionals ventured out to parts unknown with the psychological might of the world’s biggest empire (both golfing and otherwise) behind them, Jurado traveled thousands of miles to challenge the British golf monolith on its own turf.”
Jurado is also referenced in the 2005 biography "Sir Walter: Walter Hagen and the Invention of Professional Golf", by Thomas Clavin. The biography details the life and career of Walter Hagen, who won eleven major professional golf tournaments over his career. In the book, Jurado is described as having “demonstrated the tango” to a group of 1933 Ryder Cup golfers at a dancehall in Southport, UK. Jurado, who was there for the British Open, apparently “won the (dance) contest”.

Eliezer Cohen (, born 18 June 1934) is a former Israeli politician who served as a member of the Knesset for Yisrael Beiteinu and the National Union between 1999 and 2006.
Biography.
Born in Jerusalem, Cohen gained an MA at Tel Aviv University. He served as a pilot, squadron commander, base commander and Sinai area commander in the Israeli Air Force until 1974 when he retired as a colonel. During his service he was decorated for courage for an operation behind enemy lines the details of which remain confidential. He went on to become the director general of the Ben Gurion International Airport and at the same time joined the Free Centre party. He also began working as a commercial pilot for El AL Israel Airlines where over 25 years he flew each of the airline's fleet aircraft as well as participated in the airlift of Jews from Iran and Ethiopia. Between 1977 and 1978 he was a member of the Democratic Movement for Change. He was also chairman of the Israeli Organization for a Change in the Government System and made significant contributions both in and out of the Knesset to establish a constitution for Israel.
In 1990 he published a best selling book about the history of the Israeli Airforce titled in Hebrew השמים אינם הגבול or the Sky is Not the Limit. The English version of the book, Israel's Best Defense, was published in the US and the UK by Orion Books (a Division of Random House).
In 1999 he helped establish Yisrael Beiteinu, and was placed fourth on the Yisrael Beiteinu list for the elections that year. He entered the Knesset when the party won four seats, and during his first term, was a member of the House Committee, the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, the Committee on the Status of Women, the Science and Technology Committee, and the parliamentary inquiry Committee on the Issue of Water. 
During the Knesset term Yisrael Beiteinu allied with the National Union, and ran under its banner in the 2003 elections. Cohen was placed eighth on the alliance's list, and lost his seat when the party won only seven mandates. However, he re-entered the Knesset on 26 March 2003 (37 days after leaving it) after Avigdor Lieberman resigned his seat after being appointed Minister of Transport.
He decided not to run for re-election in the 2006 elections.
On October 21, 2012, Cohen was convicted of performing an indecent act. He had been accused of indecently touching an El Al flight attendant during a trip from New York to Tel Aviv. The stewardess filed a police complaint shortly after the plane landed. Cohen denied the allegations, and claimed that she filed the complaint so as order for him not to be able to complain about the poor service she offered him. After a trial in the Rishon LeZion Magistrate's Court before Judge Sarit Zamir, Cohen was found guilty.

<doc id="20002750" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20002750" title="Australia–Estonia relations">
Australia–Estonia relations

Australia–Estonia relations are foreign relations between Australia and Estonia. Australia first recognised Estonia on 22 September 1921. Australia was among the first countries to re-recognise Estonia's independence on 27 August 1991. Both countries re-established diplomatic relations on 21 November 1991.
Neither country has a resident ambassador. Australia is represented in Estonia through its embassy in Stockholm (Sweden), and through an honorary consulate in Tallinn. Estonia is represented in Australia through its Consulate-General, headed by the Consul-General Ms Triinu Rajasalu in Sydney and through 2 honorary consulates (Mrs Anu van Hattem in Perth and Dr Delaney Skerrett in Brisbane). Estonian Ambassador to Australia resides in Tallinn.
Migration.
Australia is host to one of the largest communities of Estonians abroad, with 8,232 people identifying as Estonian in the 2006 Australian Census.
Relations during the Soviet occupation.
Australia was the only Western country to break ranks and briefly recognise the Soviet annexation of Estonia (and the other Baltic states) as de jure for 17 months between July 1974 to December 1975 by the Whitlam government, while most other countries continued to recognise the independent Estonian diplomatic missions. This recognition of the Soviet annexation by the Whitlam government was repudiated by the subsequent Fraser government and relations with the independent Estonian consular representative re-established and maintained until the restoration on independence in 1991. 
Following the election of the new Liberal Party – Australian Country Party coalition in December 1975, the new government withdrew de jure recognition of the incorporation of Estonia into the Soviet Union. On 17 December of that year the Australian government instructed the Australian ambassador in Moscow that he and his staff were not to make any official visits to the Estonian SSR.
Political.
In July 1998 Estonian Prime Minister Mart Siimann visited Australia. An Australian Parliamentary delegation, led by the former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Sue West, visited Tallinn in October 1999. The most recent high-level visit was by the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Mr Philip Ruddock, in April 2002. Estonian Parliamentary delegation, led by the Speaker of Riigikogu Ene Ergma visited Australia in 2008. In 2009 Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet visited Australia and opened Estonian Honorary Consulate in Perth. In April 2010 Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith participated in the Meeting of ISAF Foreign Ministers in Tallinn, Estonia. 
Australia has signed a Working Holiday Visas arrangement with Estonia, which came into effect in May 2005.
In 2009-10, Australia and Estonia negotiated on a new social security agreement.
Cultural.
Australia has two arrangements with Estonia involving the Estonian Business School, Monash University and Swinburne University of Technology. 
The first Estonians settled in Australia in 1853 and the first Estonian Society was established in Melbourne in 1914. People settled primarily around Sydney. After Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940 and again in 1944, numerous Estonian exiles settled in Australia, contributing to development of Estonian culture in Australia. Estonian Houses were set up in Sydney (1940), Thirlmere (1952), Melbourne (1955), Adelaide (1957) and Perth (1966). Australia has the fifth largest Estonian community after Russia, Canada, Sweden and the USA. Sir Arvi Parbo, chairman of three of Australia's largest companies, is one of the best-known Estonians in Australia.
Estonian culture has been presented in Australia by many Estonian artists and musicians, including the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir and composer Arvo Pärt – honorary doctor of Sydney University. Arvo Volmer has been the principal conductor of the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra since 2004. The Estonian Archives in Sydney were established in 1952 and hold the majority of all printed Estonian works that were published outside of Estonia following World War II.
Economic.
Trade between Australia and Estonia was a modest A$ 29 million in 2007–2008. Merchandise trade between Australia and Estonia has been unstable, partly due to a big distance between the countries. Estonia's biggest import are alcoholic beverages (wines) and Australia's are wood and wood products.

Horseshoe arch

The horseshoe arch, also called the Moorish arch and the Keyhole arch, is the emblematic arch of Islamic architecture. They were formerly constructed in Visigothic Spain. Horseshoe arches can take rounded, pointed or lobed form. 
Horseshoe arches are known from pre-Islamic Syria where the form was used in the fourth century CE in the Baptistery of Mar Ya'qub (St. Jacob) at Nisibin. However, it was in Spain and North Africa that horseshoe arches developed their characteristic form. Prior to the Muslim invasion of Spain, the Visigoths used them as one of their main architectural features. The Visigothic form was adopted and developed by the Umayyads who accentuated the curvature of the horseshoe and added the alternating colours to accentuate the effect of its shape. This can be seen at a large scale in their major work, the Great Mosque of Córdoba. This style of horsehoe arch then spread all over the Calliphate and adjacent areas, and was adopted by the successor Muslim emirates of the peninsula, the taifas, as well as by the Almoravids, Almohads and the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, although also lobed, round, pointed and multifoilde arches were also used at that time. The Mozarabs also adopted this style of arch into their architecture and illuminated manuscripts.
Horseshoe arches were also used in the Mosque of Uqba, in Kairouan and, in a slightly pointed form, in the Mosque of Muhammad ibn Khairun, Tunisia. Mudéjar style, developed from the 12th to the 17th centuries, continued the tradition of horseshoe arches in the Iberian Peninsula which had been started in the 7th century by the Visigoths.
In addition to their use across the Islamic world, horseshoe arches became popular in Western countries at the time of the Moorish Revival. They were widely used in Moorish revival synagogues.

Gwen Gordy Fuqua

Gwendolyn Gordy Fuqua (November 26, 1927 – November 8, 1999) was an American businesswoman, songwriter and composer, most notably writing hit songs such as "Lonely Teardrops", "All I Could Do Was Cry" and "Distant Lover". She earned her full name after marrying Harvey Fuqua and kept the name after their divorce.
Biography.
Early life and career.
Gwen Gordy was born to Berry Gordy Sr. (or Berry Gordy II) and Bertha Ida (née Fuller) Gordy in Detroit. She was the youngest of the four Gordy sisters (Esther, Anna and Loucye) and the third youngest of the entire family (brothers Berry and Robert were born after her).
Following graduation from high school, Gwen owned the photo concession at Detroit’s popular Flame Show Bar, which helped to make her a celebrity in Detroit's nightlife. By the late 1950s, Gordy had also become a cheerleader for brother Berry's musical efforts. She provided Berry with his first important music business contact when she introduced him to the manager of the club, a white man named Al Green. Green managed music stars like Johnnie Ray and LaVern Baker and he had just signed a new singer from Detroit named Jackie Wilson. Green also owned a music publishing company and was looking for new material. She had a songwriting partnership with her brother Berry Gordy and Roquel “Billy” Davis, a childhood friend who had connections with Chess Records in Chicago. The partners started out with a bang by writing “Jim Dandy Got Married” for LaVern Baker on the Atlantic label and “All I Could Do Was Cry” for Etta James on Argo, a Chess subsidiary label. By far, however, their greatest early success was writing the first big hits for Jackie Wilson.
Starting with “Reet Petite”, Gwen, Berry and Davis penned five consecutive Jackie Wilson hits. “Lonely Teardrops”, “That’s Why (I Love You So)”, “To Be Loved”, and “I’ll Be Satisfied” all established Wilson as one of Rock and Roll’s hottest new stars.
Gordy earned small pay during this period of her work with Wilson's label Brunswick.
Although Berry, Gwen, and Roquel had provided five consecutive hits for Jackie Wilson, they had to split the songwriting royalties three ways. To bring in more income, Berry demanded that some of their songs be used for the B sides on Wilson’s recordings. After he was turned down by manager Nat Tarnopol, the trio decided to end their association with Jackie.
Gwen Gordy was the first to put the idea of starting a record company into action. She formed a label with Roquel Davis and named the company ‘Anna’, after her sister. Davis then used his contacts to make a deal with Chess Records to distribute their new Anna label nationally. Gwen and Roquel both wanted Berry to become a partner with them. However, Berry decided to go out on his own. The label helped to distribute the local Tamla Records single, Barrett Strong's "Money (That's What I Want)", which became a top 40 hit in 1960.
That year, Gordy co-wrote the ballad "All I Could Do Was Cry", which was originally offered to Erma Franklin (Aretha's sister), who almost signed with Anna Records but was rebuffed by her father, C. L. Franklin. The song eventually was sold by Chess Records who recorded the song with Etta James. Shortly after meeting Harvey Fuqua, they founded the labels Harvey Records and Tri-Phi Records, the latter label including The Spinners, who recorded their first hit with the Gordy/Fuqua composition, "That's What Girls Are Made For".
In 1961, Motown absorbed Anna Records, signing Marvin Gaye in the process. The Harvey and Tri-Phi labels were absorbed by Motown two years later after that and Gordy and Fuqua accepted staff jobs with Motown, with Gordy handling business affairs, while Fuqua became a staff writer and producer. Alongside sister Anna, she co-headed Motown's Artist Development course and by the mid-1960s was managing acts such as the Spinners, Shorty Long, Junior Walker & the All Stars and Tammi Terrell, who signed to Motown in 1965. Gordy convinced Motown to allow Terrell to perform duets with Marvin Gaye.
In 1973, Gordy had hand in adding lyrics to Marvin Gaye's composition, "Distant Lover", which became a hit single a year later after Motown released a live recording of the song. In 1977, Gordy founded Gwen Glenn Productions and produced for Motown acts such as High Inergy before retiring from the music business in the early 1980s.
Personal life.
Gordy dated fellow composer Billy Davis for a number of years. However, the relationship imploded after Gordy got involved with Harvey Fuqua. Gordy and Fuqua married in 1961 and Gordy was known afterwards as Gwen Gordy Fuqua for the duration of her life, though in 1968, Gordy and Fuqua divorced. After most of the Spinners left Motown for Atlantic Records in 1972, she struck up a romance with ex-Spinners bandmate G.C. Cameron, managed his career and later marrying him. The couple broke up in the late 1970s after Cameron left Motown. Gordy's production company "Gwen Glenn" was named after Gwen's son Glenn Gordy. Gordy moved to California in the early 1970s, where she'd remained until her death and lived comfortably off royalties after her career ended in the early 1980s.
Death.
Gwen succumbed to cancer at her home in San Diego, California on November 8, 1999 at the age of 71. She was buried in Detroit, Michigan.

Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act

The Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act is a component of the American Jobs Creation Act, passed in the United States in October 2004. The main component of the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act is the Tobacco Transition Payment Program (TTPP, otherwise known as the "Tobacco Buyout"), which was formalized by the United States Department of Agriculture in February 2005.
Tobacco Transition Payment Program.
The Tobacco Buyout ended all aspects of the federal tobacco marketing quota and price support loan programs that were established by the Agricultural Adjustment Act in 1938. Beginning with the 2005, there were no planting restrictions, no marketing cards, and no price support loans, all traditional components of tobacco agriculture in the United States. Along with the end of these policies, the Tobacco Buyout also entails the TTPP, which provides payments to tobacco quota holders and tobacco producers from 2005 to 2014.

X-parameters

X-parameters are a mathematical superset of S-parameters and are used for characterizing the amplitudes and relative phase of harmonics generated by nonlinear components under large input power levels.
Description.
X-parameters represent a new category of nonlinear network parameters for high-frequency design and were developed and introduced by Agilent Technologies as functionality included in N5242A Nonlinear Vector Network Analyzer, and the W2200 Advanced Design System in 2008. (Nonlinear vector network analyzers are sometimes called large signal network analyzers.)
X-parameters are applicable to both large-signal and small-signal conditions, for linear and nonlinear components. They are a mathematical superset of S-parameters meaning that, in the limit of a small signal, Agilent’s X-parameters reduce to S-parameters.
They help overcome a key challenge in RF engineering, namely that nonlinear impedance differences, harmonic mixing, and nonlinear reflection effects occur when components are cascaded under large signal operating conditions. This means that there is a nonlinear and as such non-trivial relationship between the properties of the individual cascaded components and the composite properties of the resulting cascade. This situation is unlike that at DC, where one can simply add the values of resistors connected in series. X-parameters help solve this cascading problem: if the X-parameters of a set of components are measured individually, the X-parameters (and hence the non-linear transfer function) can be calculated of any cascade made from them. Calculations based on X-parameters are usually performed within a harmonic balance simulator environment.
X-parameters are based on the polyharmonic distortion modeling work of Dr. Jan Verspecht and Dr. David E. Root.
While the X-parameter format and underlying equations are open and documented in several IEEE papers, the trademark owner Agilent also states that "Given the rapidly developing state of the technology, as well as finite resources, Agilent currently can provide additional support only to key customers and strategic partners whose efforts are focused on improving the technology."

Historical brightest stars

The Solar System and all of the visible stars are in different orbits about the core of the Milky Way galaxy. Thus, their relative positions change over time, and for the nearer stars this movement can be measured. As a star moves toward or away from us, its apparent brightness changes. Sirius is currently the brightest star in Earth's night sky, but it has not always been so. Canopus has persistently been the brightest star over the ages; other stars appear brighter only during relatively temporary periods, during which they are passing our solar system at a much closer distance than Canopus. The table below lists the brightest star in Earth's night sky at each period within the last or next 5 million years.

Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra

The Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra (ESAC), in English the Agrarian School of Coimbra, is a state-run polytechnic higher education school of agriculture, based in Coimbra, Portugal. The oldest of the Coimbra Polytechnical Institute's (IPC) autonomous institutions, it has also IPC's largest campus.
History.
The ESAC has a long history in vocational education and provision of services to the community started in the nineteenth century as the National School of Agriculture (1899), renamed the Regents School of Agriculture (1950), and finally in the 1970s, the Higher Agrarian School of Coimbra (Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra), a state-run higher education school of agriculture. It was incorporated into the Polytechnical Institute of Coimbra in the 1980s but preserved wide technical, pedagogical and financial autonomy. It conferred the "bacharelato" degree and the "Diploma de Estudos Especializados" (DESE) diploma. In the late 1990s, after the upgrading of the Portuguese polytechnical institutions to bachelor's degree-conferring institutions (the Portuguese "licenciatura"), the differences between this polytechnical school and the university institutions were drastically reduced, an achievement that would fully materialize after the Bologna Process in 2006/2007. Currently, the ESAC awards a 3-year 1st cycle bachelor's degree ("licenciatura"); and a 2-year 2nd cycle masters' degree in several fields including biotechnology, food engineering, organic farming, and forest engineering. In addition, ESAC has developed and expanded its own research units and programs.
The campus.
The ESAC is located in the urban area of the city of Coimbra, on a campus with strong rural characteristics, with a significant area of farmland, pasture, forest and infrastructure support for a total of 140 ha. It has a vast architectural heritage, architecture typical of the traditional rural location, including a listed building. The natural heritage of ESAC is also known for its quality and diversity: the region's largest camphor tree, a forest of oaks, and woody teixos, a tash, a Sequoia and species protected by the Habitats Directive. There is also a great faunal diversity including amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, which have been identified as species of community interest.
This set of semi-natural areas, infrastructure and equipment can be used in training activities, environmental education and recreation service to the community as the main activities of ESAC focus in teaching, research and services in the areas of agriculture, biotechnology, forestry, environment, agro-industries and eco-agritourism.
Research and services to the community.
The Centro de Estudos de Recursos Naturais, Ambiente e Sociedade (CERNAS) is ESAC's research and development centre. CERNAS develops scientific and technological knowledge in the areas of natural resources, food science, environment and sustainable development, based on multidisciplinary, cross sectoral and horizontal development, promoting research, dissemination of knowledge, training, scientific qualification and technology.
Sports and student life.
The Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra has a notable rugby union department, usually known as Agrária. The rugby team has played in the main Portuguese leagues. The students' union is the Associação de Estudantes da Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra (AE ESAC) which was founded in 1982 by students.

Francisco Medrano (poet)

Francisco Medrano was a Spanish lyric poet from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. He should not be confounded with Sebastian Francisco de Medrano who was also a poet and lived at about the same time.
Life.
Medrano was born in Seville, The dates of his birth and death are unknown, but he lived during the latter part of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth centuries. Little is known of his life except that he visited Rome.
Works.
Medrano's works were published at Palermo (1617) as an appendix to the imitation of Ovid's "Remedia Amoris" by Pedro Venegas, a poet of Seville. According to the Spanish critic Adolfo de Castro, Medrano is the best of the Spanish imitators of Horace, comparing favorably in that respect with Luis de León. Endowed with literary taste, he writes in good Spanish, and his style is free from the gongorism of his time. Among the odes of Medrano, his "La profecia del Tajo" is very similar to one of Luis de León of the same title. Although both are based upon Horace's ode to Mark Antony in which he would separate him and Cleopatra, there is a great difference between them. Léon's ode departs from the original of Horace, while Medrano's is an imitation of the latter so close as to amount almost to a translation. The poems of Medrano are reprinted in "La biblioteca de autores españoles".

The album was released in April 1972, two years after their first album, and it included the singles "Reach Out Your Hand" and "You and I". Although "Reach Out Your Hand" was a top 100 hit in the US, none of the group's singles around this time had charted in the UK. This album similarly failed, and the group disbanded after being dropped by their record label.
Manager Tony Hiller recruited a new line-up over the next few months, which was to become the more famous, Eurovision-winning formation, although one more album (a compilation) featuring the early line-up was released after this, in 1973.

The Avenging Conscience: or "Thou Shalt Not Kill" (1914) is a drama film directed by D. W. Griffith. The film is based on the Edgar Allan Poe short story "The Tell-Tale Heart" and the poem "Annabel Lee".
Plot.
A young man (Henry B. Walthall) falls in love with a beautiful woman (Blanche Sweet), but is prevented by his uncle (Spottiswoode Aitken) from pursuing her. Tormented by visions of death and suffering and deciding that murder is the way of things, the young man kills his uncle and builds a wall to hide the body. 
The young man's torment continues, this time caused by guilt over murdering his uncle, and he becomes sensitive to slight noises, like the tapping of a shoe or the crying of a bird. The ghost of his uncle begins appearing to him and, as he gradually loses his grip on reality, the police figure out what he has done and chase him down. In the ending sequence, we learn that the experience was all a dream and that his uncle is really alive.

Franz, Count of Meran

Franz Ludwig Johann Baptist Count von Meran ("b". 11 March 1839 in Vienna; "d". 27 March 1891 in Opatija) was an Austrian nobleman and Viennese courtier.
Family.
Franz was the only child of the morganatic marriage of Archduke Johann of Austria-Tuscany and Anna Maria Plochl, and a grandson of the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II. On 8 July 1862 at Ottenstein, Germany, he married Countess Theresia von Lamberg, the second child and only daughter of Franz Philipp, Count von Lamberg and Countess Caroline Hoyos.
Career.
His father having eloped with his mother (daughter of a postmaster at Bad Aussee) in defiance of his kinsman the Emperor, Franz was entitled to inherit none of his father's positions or entailed possessions. However the esteem in which his father was held by both emperor and nation as a general and patron of the arts shielded Franz from some of the scandal and consequences of the circumstances of his birth. Born legitimate but a commoner, unable to bear the Habsburg-Lorraine surname of his father's dynasty, when his mother was ennobled by the Emperor seven years after her marriage to the archduke, Franz shared in her new title, becoming Baron von Brandhofen 4 July 1834. He was raised to comital rank as Count von Meran 29 April 1844 (letters patent issuing 30 December 1845, Vienna). 
While still a child he had been designated a "Landmann" in Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Tyrol and Austria, and was accorded a seat in the Austrian House of Lords on 24 November 1842. After his father's death at "Palais Meran" in Graz in 1859, the manors of Schonna, Steinz and Gut Brandhof were combined into a "fideicommis" for him and his future descendants. 
He served the Habsburg emperors as Imperial and Royal Chamberlain, member of the Aulic Council and as a general in the Imperial army, becoming in 1868 a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. 
He died at Opatija, Croatia on 27 March 1891, aged 52.
Descendants.
Seven children were born to his marriage to Countess Theresia von Lamberg (1836–1913), who bore the titles "Count/Countess von Meran, Baron/Baroness von Brandhofen" and inter-married with prominent families of the Austro-Hungarian nobility:

The ITU Triathlon World Cup is an annual series of triathlon races staged around the world. The series is organised by the International Triathlon Union (ITU), the world governing body of the sport. BG Group was the title sponsor of the series from 2000 to 2008. Following the 2008 series the number of races in the World Cup were reduced as the ITU shifted focus to the reformatted World Triathlon Series. Since the reformat, points earned in World Cup racing are applied to the World Triathlon Series rankings.
Events.
World Cup events are located at venues in various affiliated International Triathlon Union countries. The number of World Cup events, prior to 2009, ranged from 10 to 20 events per year. The number of annual World Cup events since 2009 has since been reduced, typically numbering less than 10. 
Each World Cup event in the series involves a standard (Olympic) distance triathlon race. The swim begins with a mass start in open water followed by a draft-legal segment on the bike. The race distances are 1500 m swim, 40 km cycle, 10 km run. A total of 300 points are distributed amongst the athletes based on their finish position in each race and contribute to the overall point totals for the ITU Triathlon World Championships. The points achieved at each World Cup event, within the designated time frame leading up to an Olympic Games, also contribute towards the qualification for the Games. A prize fund of USD $100,000 is distributed equally between the men and women at each World Cup leg. 
Winners.

Moscow Art Theatre production of The Seagull

The Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) production of "The Seagull" in 1898, directed by Constantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, was a crucial milestone for the fledgling theatre company that has been described as "one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest new developments in the history of world drama." It was the first production in Moscow of Anton Chekhov's "The Seagull", though the play had been performed with only moderate success in St. Petersburg two years earlier. Nemirovich, who was a friend of Chekhov's, overcame the writer's refusal to allow the play to appear in Moscow after its earlier lacklustre reception and convinced Stanislavski to direct the play for their innovative and newly founded Moscow Art Theatre (MAT). The production opened on . The MAT's success was due to the fidelity of its delicate representation of everyday life, its intimate, ensemble playing, and the resonance of its mood of despondent uncertainty with the psychological disposition of the Russian intelligentsia of the time. To commemorate this historic production, which gave the MAT its sense of identity, the company to this day bears the seagull as its emblem.
Stanislavski's directorial conception.
While visiting his brother's estate near Kharkiv in August 1898, Stanislavski began work on his production plan (or his directorial "score" as he came to call it) for the play, into which he incorporated his sensory experiences of the Russian countryside there. He storyboarded key moments of the play with small drawings that gave the actor's spatial and proxemic relationships. He also detailed individual rhythms, physical lives and mannerisms for each character:
The score indicates when the actors will "wipe away dribble, blow their noses, smack their lips, wipe away sweat, or clean their teeth and nails with matchsticks." This tight control of the "mise en scène" was intended to facilitate the unified expression of the inner action that Stanislavski perceived to be hidden beneath the surface of the play in its subtext. Vsevolod Meyerhold, the director and practitioner whom Stanislavski on his death-bed declared to be "my sole heir in the theatre—here or anywhere else", and the actor who played Konstantin in this production, described years later the poetic effect of Stanislavski's treatment of the play:
Stanislavski's directorial score was published in 1938.
Production process.
As an actor, despite wishing to play Trigorin, Stanislavski initially prepared the role of the doctor Dorn, at Nemirovich's insistence. When Chekhov attended rehearsals for the production in September 1898, however, he felt that the performance of Trigorin was weak, which resulted in a re-casting; Stanislavski took over Trigorin and Nemirovich apologised for having kept the role from him. Olga Knipper (Chekhov's future wife) played Arkadina.
The production had 80 hours of rehearsal in total, spread over 24 sessions: 9 with Stanislavski and 15 with Nemirovich. Despite this, a considerable length by the standards of the conventional practice of the day, Stanislavski felt it was under-rehearsed and threatened to have his name removed from the posters when Nemirovich refused his demand to postpone its opening by a week.
Performance and reception.
The production opened on with a sense of crisis in the air in the theatre; most of the actors were mildly self-tranquilised with Valerian drops. In a letter to Chekhov, one audience member described how:
Nemirovich described the applause, which came after a prolonged silence, as bursting from the audience like a dam breaking. The production received unanimous praise from the press.
It was not until that Chekhov saw the production, in a performance without sets but in make-up and costumes at the Paradiz Theatre. He praised the production but was less keen on Stanislavski's own performance; he objected to the "soft, weak-willed tone" in his interpretation (shared by Nemirovich) of Trigorin and entreated Nemirovich to "put some spunk into him or something". He proposed that the play be published with Stanislavski's score of the production's "mise en scène". Chekhov's collaboration with Stanislavski proved crucial to the creative development of both men. Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried subtleties from the play and revived Chekhov's interest in writing for the stage. Chekhov's unwillingness to explain or expand on the script forced Stanislavski to dig beneath the surface of the text in ways that were new in theatre.

Charles Samuel Richter House

The Charles Samuel Richter House is a house in Montello, Wisconsin, United States, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house was built by Charles Samuel Richter, the president of the Montello Granite Company. It is sited on a hill overlooking both Montello Lake and Buffalo Lake. The plans were drawn in 1908, and construction lasted three years until it was completed in 1912. The house has thick walls with granite on the exterior and cinderblock in the middle. The two round pillars around the front entrance are solid granite, and required six months of mechanical polishing to make them perfect. The interior has hardwood floors, 54 leaded glass windows, stained glass above the bookcases on either side of the fireplace, and a curved open stairway in the foyer. At the time it was built, it was billed as the only granite house in the world.

Hans Niessenberger

Hans Niessenberger was an architect of the latter part of the Middle Ages.
Life.
Niessenberger's name is mentioned with comparative frequency in contemporaneous literature, but information about his personality and his works is somewhat more difficult to find. It seems however, that he was born in Graz, Styria. He worked on the choir of the Freiburg Minster from 1471 to 1480; in the latter year he was compelled to leave the task of building and to swear that he would not try to revenge himself for this. In 1480 he worked on St. Leonhard's Church in Basle; in 1482, on the Strasbourg Cathedral; and in the following year he probably was engaged on the Milan Cathedral with a yearly salary of 180 guilders. The choir at Freiburg was turned over to him in 1471; the contract is interesting and instructive showing as it does the manner in which buildings of this kind were erected during the latter part of the Middle Ages, and how the working hours, wages, etc. were determined upon. The choir possesses great beauty, but it also manifests the peculiarities of Late Gothic architecture. It is long, like the main church, with the nave higher, the side aisles lower and somewhat narrower than in the front, and surrounded by twelve chapels, enclosed on two sides by fluted columns. The arched roof, supported by beautifully carved columns, forms a network. The windows are characteristically Late Gothic, and the arches are wonderfully delicate.

Noah, Tennessee

Noah is an unincorporated community in Coffee County, Tennessee. In 1887 it was described as being north of the county seat of Manchester and having a population between 50 and 100. Noah is believed to be the first settlement in Coffee County, having been settled on the Noah Fork of the Duck River (Tennessee) about 1800 by the Patton Brothers, John, Daniel, and Neely.
Between 1830 and 1840 Jonathan Webster built a corn-mill on Noah Fork. In the 1880s minor industries in Noah included Samuel Brantley's saw and grist mill and the Beckman Bros.' flour and grist-mill. From the 1870s to 1902 the Farrar Distillery operated on the Thomas Farm, selling apple brandy and peach brandy, along with corn whiskey. The Farrar Distillery ceased operation in 1902 after being damaged by flooding.
The first post office opened in Noah on May 2, 1836, and closed on June 26, 1845. A second post office was established on June 23, 1880, but closed on May 15, 1905.
One of the oldest churches in Noah is the Noah’s Fork Baptist Church, erected between 1830 and 1840. The church was destroyed by fire in 1924, but was rebuilt shortly thereafter. Other churches in Noah during the 19th century include Noah Fork Separate Baptist and Noah Methodist Episcopal South.

List of markets in Barcelona

The city of Barcelona has a great many neighborhood markets that provide meat, fish, and produce on a daily basis, and are still vital to the urban life of the city. Many of the city's historic markets date to the mid-to-late 19th century, as the city was experiencing rapid growth due to the creation of the Eixample. Markets in the city are typically large enclosed spaces located centrally in the neighborhoods they serve. The larger markets are arranged into departments depending on the product. In addition, non-food items such as flowers and clothing are also sold. The city's oldest markets are located in the Ciutat Vella and Eixample, with newer markets along the fringes of the city. Many of the older markets, such as La Boqueria, not only provide food for their surrounding neighborhoods, but are tourist attractions in their own right, as they provide an essential glimpse into everyday life in the city. The markets are administered under the Mercats Municipals de Barcelona wing of the city's government.
La Boqueria.
The most well-known public market in the city is the Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria, or simply La Boqueria. Located along the La Rambla, Barcelona in the heart of the city, It is both a tourist attraction and a functioning food market. The market consists of a series of open sheds, built in 1853 under the direction of architect Mas Vila. Though the building dates from the 19th Century, a market has existed in the same location since the 12th Century.
Mercat de Sant Antoni.
Located in a triangule of Eixample blocks in between El Raval and Poble Sec, the Mercat de Sant Antoni is one of the larger markets in the city. It has been in operation since 1882. It is laid out in a Greek-cross style plan inset in a larger square.
Mercat de Santa Caterina.
Located in La Ribera just off the Via Laietana, the Mercat de Santa Caterina was recently remodeled with a colorful undulating roof. During the remodeling, the market was relocated to the stretch of the Passeig de Sant Joan in between the Arc de Triomf and the city's Parc de la Ciutadella. It has been in operation since 1848. It serves an area also previously served by the Mercat del Born, which has been converted into an archaeological site preserving the foundations of the older neighborhood underneath its roof.
Mercat de la Barceloneta.
The Mercat de la Barceloneta, like the Mercat de Santa Caterina dates from 1848. While originally an open-air market, it has since been enclosed.
Mercat de la Concepció.
The Mercat de la Concepció spans the width of a block in the heart of the Eixample. It was constructed in 1888.
Mercat del Ninot.
The Mercat del Ninot is located in the western portion of the Eixample. Its current building dates from 1933.
Mercat d'Hostafrancs.
The Mercat d'Hostafrancs is one of the larger markets in the western part of the city. It is located near Montjuic.
Mercat de Sants.
Located in the Sants district, this market dates from 1913
Mercat del Fort Pienc.
The Mercat del Fort Pienc is one of the city's newest markets, dating from 2003
Mercat de Poblenou.
One of the few markets serving the Poblenou area, the Mercat de Poblenou has served its neighborhood since 1913.
Other Markets.
In addition to its larger, more central markets, the city of Barcelona also contains many more neighborhood markets under its care.

<doc id="20003459" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20003459" title="Pluractionality">
Pluractionality

Pluractionality, or verbal number, is a grammatical device that indicates that the action or participants of a verb are plural. This differs from frequentative or iterative aspects in that the latter have no implication for the number of participants of the verb.
Often a pluractional transitive verb indicates that the object is plural, whereas in a pluractional intransitive verb the subject is plural. This is sometimes taken as an element of ergativity in the language. However, the essence of pluractionality is that the action of the verb is plural, whether because several people perform the action, it is performed on several objects, or it is performed several times. The exact interpretation may depend on the semantics of the verb as well as the context in which it is used. The lack of verbal number does not generally mean that the action and participants are singular, but rather that there is no particularly notable plurality; thus it may be better described as paucal vs. multiple rather than singular vs. plural.
Although English does not have verbal number as a grammatical device, many English verbs such as "stampede" and "massacre" are used when one of the participants involves a large number.
In Ainu.
The Ainu language of Japan has a closed class of 'count verbs'. The majority of these end in "-pa," an iterative suffix that has become lexicalized on some verbs. For example, "kor" means 'to have something or a few things', and "kor-pa" 'to have many things'; there are also causative forms of the latter, "kor-pa-re" 'to give (one person) many things', "kor-pa-yar" 'to give (several people) many things'. The "-pa" may occur more than once; this may be a case of the pluractional verb in its iterative aspect:
There are also suppletive forms:
In addition to literal number, pluractionality can be used for politeness, much as plural pronouns are in many languages. (See T-V distinction.)
In Georgian.
Georgian shows an illuminating distinction between verbal and nominal number. Georgian verbs may be suppletive for tense and animacy as well as number. When a noun occurs with a numeral in Georgian, it takes the singular form regardless of its semantic number. Verbal agreement is syntactic, and therefore is also singular. However, the pluractionality of the verbal root remains plural. Thus,
Singular participant, singular verb:
Plural participant, plural verb:
Grammatically singular but semantically plural participant, mixed verb:
In Muskogean.
Muskogean languages such as Koasati have a three-way distinction, with singular, dual, and plural verbs. However, it is not clear if this is pluractionality or simply suppletive verbal agreement for number. See Koasati language for details.
In Hopi.
In Hopi, dual nouns as subjects take the suffix "-vit" and singular verbs. Hopi does not have dual pronouns, but the plural pronouns may be used with singular verbs with a dual meaning. However, it is not clear if this is pluractionality or simply number agreement on the verb. See Hopi language for details.
In Central Pomo.
The Central Pomo language of California distinguishes ' 'sit, stay' and pluractional ' for more than one person. The perfective suffix "-w" on these verbs may be replaced with "-t" for a plural object:
As in Ainu, pluractionality may be used for politeness.
In Hausa.
Chadic languages such as Hausa use reduplicated verbs with "a general meaning of a repeated action, an action simultaneously performed by several agents, and action performed on more than one object, or various combinations of these 'plural' meanings" (Eulenberg 1971). There are also derived forms:
The first implies that I sent them all together, whereas the second means that I sent them at different times or to different places.
In Papuan languages.
Pluractionality is not uncommon in New Guinea. The Koiarian language Barai has suppletive forms: 
In American Sign Language.
In American Sign Language, verbal number is expressed through reduplication. There are several verbal aspects using modified reduplication that indicate frequent or iterative action; these are unusual cross-linguistically in that transitive verbs lose their transitivity. In addition, transitive verbs may be reduplicated to show plurality of their object; the motion of the verb is either extended or repeated to cover the spatial locations of multiple objects or recipients. These are true duals and plurals, and so may be best thought of as object incorporation rather than pluractionality. For example, is signed by flexing the index finger of an upright G hand in the direction of that person; the dual involves flexing it at both object loci (sequentially with one hand or simultaneously with both), the simple plural involves a single flexing, which spans the object group while the hand arcs across it, and an individuated plural involves multiple rapid flexings while the hand arcs.

Yu Qiuli

Yu Qiuli (; 15 November 1914 - 3 February 1999) was vice prime minister of China from 1975 until 1982 and was a member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Politburo, a group of 19 to 25 people who oversee the Communist Party of China. Yu Qiuli was also Deputy Secretary-General of China's Military Commission and Director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army 1982-87.
Biography.
Yu Qiuli was one of the last of the Long March generation of Chinese leaders who survived the epic journey by Communist forces across China in the mid-1930s to become an important figure in the administrations of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Yu was a soldier-bureaucrat who founded China's modern oil industry and helped Deng modernise his army.
By the time of his death, Yu had ceased to be one of the central figures in Chinese policy-making for more than a decade. But he had continued, like other former leaders of his generation, to keep up to date with state affairs by carrying out frequent inspection tours around the country. He was particularly involved in efforts to promote the economies of the former base areas of the Communist guerrilla armies, many of which are still mired in poverty. 
Yu's background was typical of a Communist guerrilla commander who turned to be a national leader. He was born in 1914, three years after the collapse of China's last imperial dynasty, into a poor peasant family. By the age of 14 he had taken part in a peasant uprising. At 16 he joined the Communist Party. Yu was among the tens of thousands of guerrillas and their supporters who from 1934 joined the Long March in an effort to break through the nationalist blockades around the Communist base in the south. In 1936, he was injured in the arm during a skirmish with pursuing nationalist forces. He continued on the journey north over treacherous terrain. Nine months later, after he had completed a journey of thousands of miles in terrible pain, his arm was amputated. "I am a man who has gone through nine deaths," Yu told the American journalist Harrison Salisbury in 1984. During China's Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945 and the subsequent civil war, Yu was a leading political commissar and training officer in the Communist forces. 
After the Communist victory in 1949, he became the head of a military academy and thereafter held various posts in the central military command, including the head of the military's financial affairs. He rose to the rank of lieutenant- general. In 1958, Yu was appointed minister of the petroleum industry. The move thrust him into a far more prominent role in the fledgling Communist government. In the following year, the discovery of huge oil reserves in Daqing in the desolate wastes of north-eastern China gave him a mission that on its own would ensure his place in Communist China's history books. Yu's task was to turn Daqing into a model of Chinese industry. Under Yu's direction, the mosquito-infested marshland - in winter an expanse of ice - was transformed into China's biggest oil production centre. Daqing was written into the Communist lexicon as a name synonymous with proletarian heroism. It produced the famous Maoist icon Iron Man Wang, who, in order to stop a blow-out, leapt into a pool of liquid concrete to mix it using his own body. After his success in Daqing, Yu went on to establish several more major production centres. In 1964, China declared itself self-sufficient in oil. That year, Yu was moved into the most important government ministry related to the economy, the State Planning Commission, as deputy chief. 
In 1965, Mao made him the top drafter of the third Five Year Plan and put him in charge of relocating major industries to the remote hinterland of south-western China. Despite the claim of his official biographer that Yu suffered severe persecution during the tumultuous Cultural Revolution that began in 1966, he appears to have suffered less harm than many of his colleagues. In 1975, he was appointed deputy prime minister, as was Deng. 
After the death of Mao in 1976, Yu was promoted to the ruling Politburo. He was a member of what is commonly referred to as the "petroleum faction", a group of senior officials who advocated using the profits from petroleum exports to finance high technology imports from the West. These officials were essentially conservative Stalinists in their economic thinking, favouring central planning and heavy industry - a strategy that clashed with that of the ascendant Deng. As Deng's political fortunes rose in the late 1970s, those of the petroleum faction waned. Yu was forced to make a self-criticism after the collapse of a Japanese-made oil rig in the Bohai Gulf in 1979. He was transferred from the chairmanship of the State Planning Commission to the less high profile post of head of the State Energy Commission. In 1982, however, Yu was back in uniform as head of the military's General Political Department. His predecessor in this role had been ousted after the publication of an article in the military newspaper criticising Deng's policies. Despite his differences with Deng over economic policy, Yu was apparently still regarded as someone who was relatively unfettered by old-style Maoist ideology and could therefore help the military to modernise. His official obituary says that he focused on ridding the military of "leftist" - in other words radical Maoist - thinking. Yu retired from the Politburo and other significant posts in 1987.

It! (short story)

"It!" is an influential horror short story by Theodore Sturgeon, first published in "Unknown" August 1940. The story deals with a plant monster that is ultimately revealed to have formed around a human skeleton, specifically that of Roger Kirk, in a swamp. P. Schuyler Miller described "It!" as "probably the most unforgettable story ever published in "Unknown". "
Similar characters.
The story's seminal nature is indicated by the plant-based swamp monsters that appeared in various comicbooks. Among these characters are Hillman Comics' Heap in "Airboy Comics", who debuted in what was intended as a one-time appearance in the feature "Skywolf" in "Air Fighters" #3 (Dec. 1942). Created by writer Harry Stein and artist Mort Leav, the Heap became a popular character in return appearances and later an ongoing solo feature.
Early depictions of the Heap look highly similar to the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies character Gossamer, an orange-furred, practically featureless monster in sneakers who menaced Bugs Bunny in the 1946 animated short "Hair-Raising Hare" before going on to other appearances (named "Rudolph" in one).
Solomon Grundy in "All-American Comics" is the result of a criminal having fallen in a swamp, though he did not have a plantlike appearance.
Sturgeon's story continued to show influence after the relaxation of the Comics Code Authority's restrictions on horror late in 1971. Man-Thing first appeared (in an unrestricted black and white magazine-size comic) from Marvel Comics in May 1971, and DC Comics introduced Swamp Thing in the anthology comic House of Secrets #92 in June 1971. A different character, based upon the "House of Secrets" story, also called Swamp Thing debuted in issue #1 of its own title (November 1971) after popular response to the original story. Gerry Conway and Len Wein, the writers who created Man-Thing and Swamp Thing respectively, were good friends and roommates at the time but did not discuss their work with each other.
Marvel also published an adaptation of the original story in "Supernatural Thrillers" #1. Tony Isabella and Roy Thomas were asked by Marvel's editors to consider an ongoing series with Sturgeon's swamp creature, but they felt the similarity to Marvel's own title, Man-Thing would create conflicts.
The 1980s saw the introduction of Bog Swamp Demon and two Swamp Thing movies, as well as Dave Sim's Man-Thing and Swamp Thing parodies, Woman-Thing and Sump-Thing, in the pages of "Cerebus".
The 1990s introduced more parodies, including Swamp Beast in Harvey Comics' "Monster in My Pocket" and Man-Thang and Swamp-Thang in Marvel's "What The--?!".

Lunheng

The Lunheng (), published in 80 CE, is a wide-ranging Chinese classic text containing critical essays by Wang Chong (27- ca. 100 CE) on natural science, Chinese mythology, philosophy, and literature.
Title.
The title "Lunheng" combines "lun" or "discuss; talk about; discourse; decide on; determine; mention; regard; consider" and "heng" "crosswise; balance beam; weigh; measure; judge; appreciate". English translations of the title include "Disquisitions" (Alfred Forke), "Critical Essays" (Fung Yu-lan), "The Balanced Inquiries" (Wing-tsit Chan), or "Discourses Weighed in the Balance" (Joseph Needham).
Text.
The received "Lunheng" comprises 85 "pian" "articles; sections; chapters" in 30 "juan" "scrolls; volumes; books", with more than 200,000 characters. Actually, 84 "pian" is more accurate because the text only contains the title of Chapter 44 "Zhaozhi" 招致.
Yang Wenchang 楊文昌 edited the first printed "Lunheng" edition, which was the basis for subsequent editions. Its 1045 CE preface notes that Yang compared 2 complete and 7 partial textual copies and corrected 11,259 characters.
"No commentaries to the "Lun heng" appear to have been written before the nineteenth century," write Pokora and Loewe (1993:311), which is unusual among Chinese classics. The first "Lunheng" commentators were Yu Yue 俞樾 (1821–1907), Sun Yirang 孫詒讓 (1848–1908), and Yang Shoujing 楊守敬 (1835–1915).
History.
Based on internal evidence, Forke (1907:9) concludes the Later Han Dynasty "Lunheng" text "must date" from the years 76-84 CE. Chapter 38 (齊世 "The Equality of the Ages", tr. Forke 1907:480) says, "Our present sage and enlightened sovereign is continuing the blessings and the prosperity of the reigns of" Emperor Guangwu (r. 25-57 CE) and Emperor Ming (r. 58-75 CE), which implies the period of Emperor Zhang (r. 75-88 CE). Chapter 30 (講瑞 "Arguments on Ominous Creatures", tr. Forke 1907:372) notes it was completed during the "Jianchu" 建初 era (76-84 CE).
Fung (1953:151) notes the "Lunheng" "was probably completed" during the years 82 and 83 CE. "The authenticity of the work has not been brought into question", write Pokora and Loewe (1993:309), and the text "may possibly have been completed between 70 and 80", based upon collections of Wang's earlier writings or essays.
Content.
The contents of the "Lunheng" are summarized by Pokora and Loewe.
In discussing natural phenomena and their implications or causes, matters of popular belief and misconception and political issues, the book is often written in polemical form. A controversial statement is made, to be followed by the author's critical rebuttal, which is often supported by quotations from earlier writings. In many ways the "Lun heng" may be regarded as an encyclopaedic collection of the claims and beliefs of Chinese religion, thought and folklore. (1993:313) 
Wang's "Lunheng" frequently espouses Daoist notions of naturalism. For example, Chapter 54 "Ziran" 自然 "Spontaneity" says.
By the fusion of the fluids ["qi"] of Heaven and Earth all things of the world are produced spontaneously, just as by the mixture of the fluids of husband and wife children are born spontaneously. Among the things thus produced, creatures with blood in their veins are sensitive of hunger and cold. Seeing that grain can be eaten, they use it as food, and discovering that silk and hemp can be worn, they take it as raiment. Some people are of opinion that Heaven produces grain for the purpose of feeding mankind, and silk and hemp to cloth them. That would be tantamount to making Heaven the farmer of man or his mulberry girl feeds the silkworms, I it would not be in accordance with spontaneity, therefore this opinion is very questionable and unacceptable. 
Reasoning on Taoist principles we find that Heaven ["tian"] emits its fluid everywhere. Among the many things of this world grain dispels hunger, and silk and hemp protect from cold. For that reason man eats grain, and wears silk and hemp. That Heaven does not produce grain, silk, and hemp purposely, in order to feed and clothmankind, follows from the fact that by calamitous changes it does not intend to reprove man. Things are produced spontaneously, and man wears and eats them; the fluid changes spontaneously, and man is frightened by it, for the usual theory is disheartening. Where would be spontaneity, if the heavenly signs were intentional, and where inaction ["wu wei"? (tr. Forke 1907:92, cf. Fung 1953:152 and Chan 1963:296)

The Environmental and Engineering Geophysical Society (EEGS) is an international, applied scientific organization (not-for-profit corporation) that has 700 members. One of the society’s major activities is producing its annual meeting, the Application of Geophysics to Engineering and Environmental Problems (SAGEEP). It develops and distributes a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the "Journal of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics (JEEG"), as well as an electronic quarterly newsletter, "FastTIMES". It publishes, markets, and distributes books and CD-ROMs on the application and use of near-surface geophysical technologies, both in print and electronically (EEGS Research Collection, is an online reference featuring the entire collection of the organization’s "JEEG"s and SAGEEP proceedings).
History.
EEGS was founded in 1992 and is incorporated in the State of Colorado as a not-for-profit corporation and has approximately 700 international members. There are student chapters in North America and Canada. In addition, EEGS maintains ties with the near-surface geophysics section (formerly EEGS-European Section) of the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers, the Near-Surface Geophysics Section of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the Near-Surface Focus Group of the American Geophysical Union, and formal affiliated society agreements with several international professional societies.
Meetings.
SAGEEP.
The annual meeting of the organization, known as the Symposium on the Application of Geophysics to Environmental and Engineering Problems (SAGEEP), is held in the late winter or early spring and provides geophysicists, engineers, geoscientists and end-users from around the world an opportunity to discuss near-surface applications of geophysics and learn about developments in near-surface geophysics.
Since 1988 at the Colorado School of Mines, the symposium has been held over a five-day period at locations throughout the United States, with 150 oral and poster presentations, educational workshops, vendor presentations, and a commercial exhibition. A set of proceedings, comprising technical papers presented at the conference, is distributed on CD and available online at EEGS’ Research Collection site. 
EEGU.
Environmental and Engineering Geophysical University (EEGU) is held over three days in parallel with the regular SAGEEP technical sessions.

Federalism in Nigeria

Federalism in Nigeria refers to the devolution of federated self-governance by the West African nation of Nigeria to its first-level subdivisions, currently known as states.
History.
Federalism has been present in Nigeria since the former British colony was reorganized into a federation of three regions in 1946.Regionalism was introduced to the Nigeria system by the Richards Constitution.
Before and right after independence.
Federalism is a system of government in which governmental parts that exists in a country are shared between central government and component region.It is also defined as the system of government in which governmental parts are shared between the central government, i.e. the federal government and its components (state and local government).
Bernard Bourdillon the Governor-general at that time initiated and laid the foundation of federalism in Nigeria in 1939 by creating three provinces. He later handed over the constitution to his successor Arthur Richards and it became the Richards Constitution of 1946.
At the beginning of formal British indirect rule in 1901, Nigeria was divided into two regions: Northern and Southern, both of which were divided into provinces. From 1901 to 1958, the number of regions was increased to three through both acquisition of territories and partition from existing provinces. However, while native-born chiefs and clerks were appointed to govern the provinces, the regions were governed by the British-appointed colonial authorities, and such regions were made dependent upon the colonial authorities for martial law, manpower and management of resources.
With the approach of independence, power over the regions was given to Nigerian-born citizens, and regional legislatures were established. By the time that Nigeria had declared itself a republic and replaced the post of Governor-General with the post of President, a national bicameral parliament was established and the country was considered a federation of the three regions. The Mid-Western Region was formed from the Western Region in 1966, and Lagos, the capital, was effectively governed as an unofficial fourth region outside the bounds of the Eastern Region.
First coup, counter-coup and the new states.
After the first coup and under the short-lived military government of Aguiyi-Ironsi, the country was reorganized under a central government. Following the counter-coup which resulted in Aguiyi-Ironsi's deposition and assassination, Nigeria was reorganized as a federal country, with three of the regions being divided into newer entities and all first-level subdivisions being renamed as states:
Mid-Western and the states of former Eastern Region made a bid to secede from Nigeria as the states of Biafra and Republic of Benin, resulting in the Nigerian Civil War.
1976.
In 1976, six years after the end of the civil war, the states were further reorganized:
State boundaries and names were also reorganized.
Causes for, and effects of federalism.
Causes for federalism.
The demand for the creation of newer states in Nigeria tends to emanate from sub-state groups, often ethnic- or tribal-interest groups, which accuse the current larger state governments of subverting or ignoring the interests and necessities of the more local regions.
Also the rate at which the population of Nigeria was increasing only a federal system of government could be used so that the wish of the people could be ascertained since government is brought nearer to the people and regions are autonomous, the available resources of the subordinate regions can easily be used to render essential services to the people.
Effects of federalism, Nigerian styled..
A much-criticized effect of the current type of federalism, of 36 states from previous pre civil war 3 regions is the creation of a political subclass of state bureaucracies, often headed by governors who are accused of, and sometimes successfully prosecuted for, monetary corruption.
Furthermore, one of the outstanding peculiarities of Nigerian politics emanates from the promulgation of sharia law in the northern states, which is only applicable to Muslim residents, while Nigerian states outside the "sharia zone" operate their legal systems by common and customary law.
Problems of Federalism In Nigeria
1) Resource Control
2) Issue of secession

Malinvestment

Malinvestment is a concept developed by the Austrian School of economic thought, that refers to investments of firms being badly allocated due to what they assert to be an artificially low cost of credit and an unsustainable increase in money supply, often blamed on a central bank. This concept is central to the Austrian business cycle theory. Austrian economists such as Nobel laureate F. A. Hayek advocate the idea that malinvestment occurs due to the combination of fractional reserve banking and artificially low interest rates misleading relative price signals which eventually necessitate a corrective contraction—a boom followed by a bust.
The concept dates back to at least 1867. In 1940, Ludwig von Mises wrote, "The popularity of inflation and credit expansion, the ultimate source of the repeated attempts to render people prosperous by credit expansion, and thus the cause of the cyclical fluctuations of business, manifests itself clearly in the customary terminology. The boom is called good business, prosperity, and upswing. Its unavoidable aftermath, the readjustment of conditions to the real data of the market, is called crisis, slump, bad business, depression. People rebel against the insight that the disturbing element is to be seen in the malinvestment and the overconsumption of the boom period and that such an artificially induced boom is doomed. They are looking for the philosophers' stone to make it last."

Clube Atlético de Valdevez known as CA Valdevez is a Portuguese football club from Arcos Valdevez which was founded in 1945. The team ran into serious financial problems after the 2009-10 season and was stopped. They previously played in the Portuguese Second Division Serie A and finished in 3rd place during the 2007/08 season. They will continue to play their home games in 2012-13 in Estádio Municipal da Coutada with a capacity of 4,000.
The team currently has no coach or president yet announced. The local town government, according to an article in an August weekly edition of the "Noticias dos Arcos", has donated 20,000 euros to help start the team's return to the districts league of Viana do Castelo. According to the website zerozero.pt, the 2012-13 roster features a number of players from local clubs such as Ponte De Barca and Proselense. The schedule for 2012-13 has not yet been announced by the regional federation.
Prior to the club stopping, they successfully competed and during the 2008-09 Portuguese Cup they reached as far as the quarterfinals before losing in penalty kicks to First Division Club Nacional. This match, which was moved from the Coutada Stadium to the new regional stadium in Melgaco, disappointed many followers who did not want to travel during a weekday to a remote location, which became necessary in order for it to be televised. Outside of hosting First Division Club Benfica in a Portuguese Cup match in the early 1980s, the match against Nacional was the most important of the current generation.
There are various prominent alumni associated with the team, the biggest is former manager Jorge Casquilha (2007–08), who is currently managing First Division Newly Promoted Portuguese Club Moreirense.

Wycoller Hall

Wycoller Hall was a late sixteenth century manor house in the village of Wycoller, Lancashire. The hall was the centre of a sizable estate but subsequently fell into disrepair. The ruins are now listed, and form part of Wycoller Country Park.
History.
Wycoller Hall dates back to the end of the 16th century, and was built upon the site of a house occupied in 1507 by Piers Hartley. By the 1590s a substantial house had been built, probably sometime in the mid 16th century, replacing Piers' original dwelling. The estate then came into the possession of the Cunliffe family, after the marriage of Pier's daughter Elizabeth to Nicholas Cunliffe in 1611. They had a number of children, one of whom, John, married Grace Hartley in 1628. The Cunliffes settled at Wycoller in the 1720s, after losing their ancestral home to debts. The estate then passed through several brothers, all of whom died without issue, before passing to the grandson of one of the sisters, Henry Owen, on the condition that Owen took the name Cunliffe. He took the name Henry Owen Cunliffe, and became the new squire. He embarked on a large building project for the hall, to create a home that he felt would be worthy of his position, and that would attract a new wife.
The building project took over a year to complete, during which time Henry moved out and lodged at the nearby public house. The work included the fitting of a new porch, a large range of mullioned windows, and the modernisation of the interiors. By the time it was complete Henry had married and the couple moved into the hall to enjoy their new lifestyle. Henry was however a keen sportsman and gambler, and ran up heavy debts. On his death in 1818 the property passed to his nephew, Charles Cunliffe Owen, but Charles could not afford to pay off the debts, and the estate was parcelled off to the creditors. The hall passed to a distant relative, John Oldham, and then to the Rev. John Roberts Oldham. The latter arranged for large parts of the stonework to be sold off to build a cotton mill at Trawden.
Despite this, much of the hall survived into the late 19th century, though it was unoccupied and steadily crumbling, with considerable amounts of the stonework being removed for local buildings. The entire village subsequently passed into the ownership of the local Water Board, but continued to decline. A local conservation group, 'The Friends of Wycoller' was founded in 1948, and began a campaign to conserve the historic village. Their work on the hall included the restoration of the fireplace in the 1950s. The entire area was sold in 1973 to Lancashire County Council, which declared the entire village a conservation area, and designated the surrounding as a Country Park. The ruins of the hall were designated as a scheduled monument and are Grade II listed. An exhibition about the history of the hall, the village, and the surrounding area was established in the aisled barn close to the ruins.
Design.
The house had a grand two storey porch, which had been removed in the 1870s and re-erected in Trawden. The porch led into the great hall, dominated by a large stone fireplace. On the right is a key hole shaped opening, the function of which is still unknown. The part of the house rebuilt in the time of Henry Owen Cunliffe was three storeys high, and contained the drawing and sitting rooms, and the bedrooms. Behind the main hall were the kitchens. Beyond the main building of Wycoller Hall was a courtyard with coach-house and stables. Gardens were laid out in Henry Owen Cunliffe's period of occupancy, as was a cock pit. During the last years of occupancy the house was divided in two and lived in by two different families.
Wycoller and the Brontës.
Wycoller Hall is thought to be the inspiration for Ferndean Manor in Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre". The Brontës lived in the nearby village of Haworth, and both Charlotte and her sister Emily probably visited Wycoller on their walks. Parallels have also been drawn with the owner of Ferndean, Mr Rochester's father, and Henry Owen Cunliffe. One of the occupants of the hall, Elizabeth Cunliffe, also became Elizabeth Eyre through marriage. Wycoller Hall was even used to illustrate the cover of the 1898 edition of "Jane Eyre".
Ghosts at Wycoller.
Wycoller and Wycoller Hall also became the site of several ghost stories. One such concerns the murder of the wife of one of the squires of the hall, one Simon Cunliffe. During the reign of King Charles II the squire and his hunt were pursuing a fox. The fox ran into the hall and up into the woman's chamber. The hounds pursued it and attacked it, with Simon Cunliffe riding his horse into the hall and up the stairs. Finding his wife terrified at the scene, he cursed her cowardice and raised his hunting crop as if to strike her. She then died of fright. The squire is supposedly still seen at night returning to the hall, dressed in the costume of the early Stuart era. The noise of his horse clattering across the bridge and up to the hall door, and then up the stairs can be heard, followed by a woman's screams. The ghost then returns the way he came. He supposedly is seen once a year, during stormy weather when darkness has fallen.
The murdered woman herself is recorded to have appeared once to two lovers at the hall. The ghost wore a black silk dress and foretold the downfall of the Cunliffes and the ruin of the hall. She was later seen by two workmen, but has not been seen since the death of the last Cunliffe of Wycoller. Despite the compelling nature of the stories, there never was a Simon Cunliffe as squire of Wycoller.
Another of the Cunliffes was said to have travelled to the West Indies, where he married a West Indian woman. On the return voyage he began to have second thoughts of the suitability of his marriage, so he threw his wife overboard, where she drowned. The ghost of the woman followed him back to Wycoller, in search of her murderer.

Nuclear power station Smolensk ( []) is a nuclear power station in Russia. It is located in the Smolensk region, in Desnogorsk province, approximately 100 km from Smolensk, 115 km from Bryansk and 320 km from Moscow. Smolensk Nuclear Power Plant is the biggest NPP in the Nechernozem region of Russia.
Smolensk NPP operates three RBMK-1000 reactors (1000MW water-cooled graphite-moderated channel-type reactors). The plant was supposed to have four units but the construction of the 4th reactor was stopped in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.
All the units are equipped with emergency response systems, which can prevent release of radioactive material into the environment even in case of serious accident; for example breakage of pipes in the reactor cooling circuit. The reactor cooling circuit is housed in hermetic reinforced concrete boxes that can withstand a force of 4.5 kgf/cm2.

The music videos for 360°, Do☆Positive, and Ai have all debuted on 1 December, 4 December, and 5 December 2008 respectively—and subsequently, all three have appeared on the internet.
The music video for ""360°"" features Otsuka in a large costume with ornaments of butterflies and piano keys, while switching back between scenes of a player piano, her, and a Merry-Go-Round which is repeatedly mentioned in the lyrics. The video is very abstract, a similar concept she used for her video "Rocket Sneaker".
The video for ""Do☆Positive"" displays Otsuka is a large afro-wig, accompanied by a band, singing in a seemingly basement-garage type setting. This PV was directed by スミス.
The video for ""Ai"" is the most plot-oriented out of the debuting three music videos. The video takes place mostly in a park in a large Japanese countryside-setting, and features Otsuka singing to a large, growing crowd. Out of all three, this PV is the most traditional Otsuka-style for videos. The video also features clips of couples, and children. A few interesting clips include Otsuka when she was younger, and of her parents' marriage and mother's pregnancy.
There is also a video for Bye Bye which was released with the single.

Flaw lead

Flaw lead is an oceanographic term for a waterway opening between pack ice and fast ice. Flaw lead occurs annually at the time when central pack ice drifts from coastal ice, thereby creating the flaw. The process begins in autumn. Flaw leads can have interconnected polynyas. The Canadian government's Circumpolar Flaw Lead System Study, through the University of Manitoba examines the physical changes and their effects on biological processes with flaw leads.
A similar opening ("lead") can exist between pack ice and the shore, referred to as a shore lead.

Willard Park (Cleveland park)

Willard Park is a public park in downtown Cleveland, in the U.S. state of Ohio. The park sits at the northwest corner of East 9th Street and Lakeside Avenue, adjacent to Cleveland City Hall, and is within the boundaries of the Cleveland Mall historic district. It is the location of the public sculpture "Free Stamp", and is the home of the original Cleveland Fire Fighters Memorial.
"Free Stamp".
The Free Stamp is an outdoor sculpture located in Willard Park. Created by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, it has been called the "world's largest rubber stamp". The dimensions of the sculpture are by by . The sculpture depicts a rubber stamp with the word "FREE" in its stamping area.
The work was commissioned by Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio) in 1985 for display at its soon-to-be-constructed headquarters building on Public Square, which became the BP Tower. The piece was originally designed to stand upright, with the lettering of the stamp hidden from view on its "stamp pad". According to one of the executives working with Oldenburg, the message on the stamp was intended as a reference to the Civil War-era Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, located across the street. 
Sohio had previously been acquired by BP, and BP executive Robert Horton took over the management of Sohio before the sculpture was installed. He believed that the stamp was "inappropriate" for the location, and that Oldenburg actually intended to mock BP about Sohio's loss of corporate freedom and the lack of freedom in office work. The company gave the artists permission to move the sculpture to another part of the city, but they refused. As a result, the stamp was placed in storage in a facility in Whiting, Indiana. Over the next several years, BP, the artists, and the city consulted to find a new site for the sculpture. Several sites were proposed, including the Cleveland Museum of Art. The artists, who wanted the sculpture to remain near Public Square, finally chose Willard Park. 
In 1991, BP donated the sculpture to the city of Cleveland. The stamp was modified to sit on its side, and it was dedicated in its new location in November 1991. Oldenburg reportedly said that it looked as if a giant hand had picked up the sculpture from its intended location at the BP Tower and angrily hurled it several blocks, where it ended up on its side.

Glen Eden Lutheran Memorial Park

Glen Eden Lutheran Memorial Park is a non-profit cemetery in Livonia, Michigan and Macomb Township. Glen Eden began serving the community when a small group of investors started the cemetery in 1929. In 1932, a twist of fate transferred ownership and operation of the cemetery to four Lutheran churches. 
The St. Gabriel Mausoleum was designed by the architectural firm of J. Stuart Todd of Dallas, Texas, an international firm with over 1,500 completed cemetery projects to their credit. McCarthy & Smith, Inc. of Farmington Hills, Michigan providers of construction services to cemeteries throughout southeast Michigan for over thirty years provided construction services on the mausoleum. Both of these firms were also involved in the development of the first new cemetery in Macomb County in over three decades Glen Eden East, in Macomb Township as well. 
Surrounding the Chapel are four traditional burial gardens, beautifully landscaped and distinguished by specific themes that reflect life and individual character. The Garden of Faith, Garden of Hope and Garden of Resurrection feature individual and family lots while two specially dedicated gardens honor community members who have served during their lives; The Pastors Point Garden reserved for Lutheran pastors and their spouses, and The Garden of Valor which provides a special setting of honor for veterans and their spouses.
In June 1962, Lutheran War Veterans Auxiliary, Gold Star Mothers and Blue Star Mothers, as a special place to pay tribute to veterans, dedicated Glen Eden’s Veteran’s Monument, now the focus of the Garden of Valor. To commemorate veterans who are buried elsewhere, a cenotaph memorial surrounds the massive flagpole in the Memorial Plaza Boulevard featuring a solid bronze bas-relief sculpture depicting those who have served their country.

Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, provides an integrated, systematic approach to the development and purchase of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies.
BARDA manages the procurement and advanced development of medical countermeasures for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents, as well as the advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures for pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases.
Public Concerns with Lack of Transparency.
Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) has introduced the Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005, S1873, that would create a new agency in the Department of Health and Human Services(HHS) to research and develop strategies to combat bio-terrorism and natural diseases. While Congress has created several agencies recently in response to homeland security concerns, most notably the Department of Homeland Security, Burr proposes for the first time ever to completely exempt this new agency from all open government laws.
Neither the CIA nor the Defense Department has such an exemption.
The Freedom of Information Act, however, already includes an exemption for national security information, as well as eight other exemptions ranging from privacy issues to confidential business information and law enforcement investigations. If the public disclosure of information would threaten national security, then the government may withhold the requested information.
"The well-established and time-tested FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) provisions already address Burr's concerns," explains Sean Moulton, OMB Watch senior policy analyst, "thereby making the blanket exemption for BARDA unnecessary and unwise."
Congress established and strengthened FOIA over the years to create a reasonable, consistent level of accountability among government agencies. Under FOIA, when the public requests agency records, the agency is compelled to collect and review the requested information. The only decision for the agency is whether specific records can or can not be released under the law based on the exemptions from disclosure written into the law. However, the Burr legislation reverses the process: it does not require BARDA to collect or review the requests for disclosure.
Instead, the agency can automatically reject requests. Still more troubling, the law prohibits any challenges of determinations by the Director of BARDA or Secretary of HHS, stating that the determination of the Director or Secretary with regards to the decision to withhold information "shall not be subject to judicial review."
Mark Tapscott at the Heritage Foundation writes that "BARDA will essentially be accountable to nobody and can operate without having to worry about troublesome interference from courts or private citizens like you and me."
Additionally:
The Homeland Security Act of 2002 gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) the right to authorize mandatory vaccinations and drugging once a state of emergency is implemented.
This new act will exempt pharmaceutical companies from any liability for death or injury as long as their drug or vaccine has been designated as a “countermeasure.”
http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/100205_health_tyranny.shtml - by Michael Kane
http://www.foreffectivegov.org/node/2702
http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/rightsandfreedoms/a/bardabill.htm
The Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005 (S. 1873), nicknamed "Bioshield Two" and sponsored by Senator Richard Burr (R-North Carolina), aims shorten the pharmaceutical development process for new vaccines and drugs in case of a pandemic, and to protect vaccine makers and the pharmaceutical industry from legal liability for vaccine injuries.
Support
Much of the support for the bill comes from Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and its members. In the 2002 election cycle, PhRMA contributed $3,505,052 to politicians, with 95% going to Republicans. The top recipient in the Senate was the bill's sponsor, Senator Richard Burr, who received $288,684, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.
Senator Burr said the legislation "creates a true partnership" between the federal government, the pharmaceutical industry and academia to "walk the drug companies through the Valley of Death" in bringing a new vaccine or drug to market.
Exemptions from open records and meetings laws would streamline the development process, safeguard national security and protect the proprietary interests of drug companies, say Republican backers of the bill.
Opposition
Senator Chris Dodd (D-Connecticut) said "Their plan will protect companies that make ineffective or harmful medicines, and because it does not include compensation for those injured by a vaccine or drug, it will discourage first responders and patients from taking medicines to counter a biological attack or disease outbreak."
Requirements Setting.
Medical countermeasure requirements in BARDA provide a solid foundation for establishing advanced development and acquisition programs that support the overarching ASPR mission of reducing the adverse health effects of public health emergencies, including those caused by pandemic influenza, CBRN threat agents and emerging diseases. These requirements are critical to establishing programs to meet our preparedness goals. They also create incentives for industry participation and shape the market for countermeasure products.
Requirements for medical countermeasures for CBRN threats are defined with input from stakeholders across the federal government within the structure of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE). Once established, these requirements drive BARDA advanced development and acquisition programs, as well as research, development, and acquisition efforts in HHS. CBRN medical countermeasure requirements are consistent with the planning and prioritization expressed in the HHS PHEMCE Implementation Plan for CBRN Threats.
Pandemic Influenza requirements are defined by strategic objectives established in the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza and the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan.
Advanced Research and Development.
From its inception, BARDA has been committed to creating a robust and dynamic pipeline of medical countermeasures through advanced development of new and improved medical countermeasures. The goal of medical countermeasure development is to provide multiple product candidates in each program to both account for attrition in medical countermeasure development and to establish multi-product/multi-manufacturer portfolios for sustainability and redundancy.
BARDA medical countermeasures include vaccines, antimicrobial drugs, therapeutic products, diagnostics and non-pharmaceutical medical supplies and devices for public health medical emergencies including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases. BARDA currently has three programs dedicated to overseeing the advanced development of these medical countermeasures: Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN); pandemic influenza; and emerging infectious diseases. BARDA’s Influenza and Emerging Diseases Division is in the planning phase for its Emerging Infectious disease program. This program will, when stood up, support the advanced development of vaccine, therapeutic and diagnostic medical countermeasures that address emerging disease threats.
Integrated National Biodefense Medical Countermeasures Portfolio.
Integrated National Biodefense Medical Countermeasure Portfolio “One-Portfolio Approach.” The Department of Defense (DoD) and HHS each identify medical countermeasure requirements to address their different missions and focus. DoD’s focus is on protecting the armed forces prior to exposure, whereas HHS’s focus is on response to threats to the civilian population after exposure in a CBRN event. However, there are areas of common requirements or interest where medical countermeasure candidates, resources and information can be appropriately shared to maximize opportunities for success in the development of medical countermeasures for the highest priority threats. BARDA, in partnership with other HHS and DoD partners, is leading an Integrated National Biodefense Medical Countermeasure Portfolio to leverage resources and programs across the agencies that develop and acquire CBRN medical countermeasures to more effectively address the broad range of common threats and requirements. Members of this Integrated Portfolio include BARDA, biodefense programs in NIAID and other Institutes of NIH, and multiple elements of the DoD Chemical and Biological Defense Program
Stockpiling Programs.
The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) established BARDA as the focal point within HHS for the advanced development and acquisition of medical countermeasures to protect the American civilian population against Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) and naturally occurring threats to public health.
BARDA’s stockpiling efforts are focused on building reserves of critical countermeasures as they emerge from Advanced Development. Stockpiling contributes to preparedness in two ways:
BARDA’s acquisitions for the stockpile are not one-time events, complete upon the approval/licensure of a product. Rather, programs are structured to include incremental milestone acquisitions during late stage development, to make available products still in development that may increase preparedness in an event, pending Emergency Use Authorization. Furthermore, we aim to establish stockpiling milestones to address long term commitments post-licensure.
CBRN Stockpiling Programs.
In FY 2004, Congress appropriated $5.6 billion to the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund (SRF) to support the Project BioShield goal of acquiring CBRN medical countermeasures over a 10-year period. BARDA has used these funds to support major acquisition programs leading to procurement of medical countermeasures against top priority threats.
Pandemic Influenza Stockpiling Programs.
Using funds from the Pandemic Influenza Emergency Supplemental Fund, BARDA is leading the nation toward the vaccine and antiviral stockpile goals for preparedness for pandemic influenza.
Manufacturing and Infrastructure Building.
Ensuring the availability of medical countermeasures for public health emergencies is central to BARDA’s mission. This includes ensuring that manufacturing infrastructure is sufficient to support the production of required products, in a manner that is timely, reliable and cost effective.
BARDA is taking several approaches to bringing online the necessary infrastructure for medical countermeasure manufacturing. We are supporting the construction of new facilities as well as retrofitting existing facilities for maximal capacity and flexibility. We are also exploring the use of multiproduct manufacturing facilities to provide flexibility and surge capacity. So that we are able to rapidly provide countermeasures in the dosage forms required for use in the field, we are establishing a network of formulation/fill-finish manufacturers for emergency production and distribution. BARDA is also exploring the creation of centers of excellence for the development and production of non-commercial products, with assistance from industry partners.
Advancing Innovation.
The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) charges BARDA to support innovation to reduce the time and cost of medical countermeasures and product advanced research and development. This is to be accomplished through development of technologies that assist the advanced development of countermeasures, investment in research tools and technologies, and research to promote strategic initiatives including rapid diagnostics, broad spectrum antimicrobials, and vaccine manufacturing technologies.
We see this innovation mandate as an opportunity to work with our partners (including NIH, DoD, CDC, industry, and academia) to create new ways to “make medical countermeasure better.” Examples of this approach to innovation could include the development of animal models to support efficacy testing, immune modulation and other broad-spectrum approaches, immunity assessment, and analytical (potency) assays.
An example of innovation from the Pandemic Influenza program is BARDA’s Mix and Match study, assessing various combinations of antigens and adjuvants to obtain a more robust immune response. BARDA plans to support similar initiatives, leveraging technology platforms and products from multiple companies. PAHPA provided an important “antitrust” authority that is used to facilitate cooperation among companies for whom such cooperation would otherwise be difficult to accomplish.
BARDA’s Strategic Science Team helps bring innovation to our programs. This team is the focal point for discussions with the creators of new technologies, ideas, and products. Together with the program managers, they seek ways to integrate innovative science into the development and production of medical countermeasures.

Jack Gore

Jack Gore (16 June 1899–18 March 1971) was a Welsh international rugby flanker who played rugby union for Blaina and rugby league for Salford. His son, Billy Gore, played international rugby for Wales national rugby union team the same as his father.
Rugby career.
Gore played all his rugby union for the unfashionable lower level club Blaina, though during this period the Welsh selectors would often choose tough manual workers to represent the forward positions. Gore first represented Wales in the 1924 Five Nations Championship in a match at the Cardiff Arms Park against Ireland. Under the captaincy of Jack Wetter, Gore found himself on the losing side which stopped a run of 9 successive home wins for Wales. His second game was against France and although a win for Wales, it was a poor Welsh performance caused by players being thrown out of position by the selectors decision to suspend Ossie Male on the trip to Paris. Gore was selected later in the year to face the touring New Zealand team. Wales were totally outclassed by the All Blacks, though the forwards put on a spirited display.
The next year Gore played his final game for Wales, when he faced England during the 1925 Championship. Wales lost the game 12-6, and Gore played no further international union games. He switched codes to the professional league game when he joined Salford later in 1925.
Whilst Captain of Salford he played for both the England and Wales positioned at Loose forward/Lock, i.e. number 13, during the era of contested scrums.
Many say that he played for the Great Britain rugby league side as he was of Welsh birth and was not the only Welshman to play for this side, however local Salford newspaper reports of the day clearly record: To Jack Gore our Captain, we offer our very hearty congratualtions on his selection as Loose Forward for 'England' on the occasion of the Third and Final Test against the "All Blacks" to be played at Leeds, on 15 January 1927. This match of course depends upon what transpires at the League Councils Meeing, held on Wednesday last. This honour, by the way is not unexpected, when having read "Old Stagers" report of the recent Wales v. "All Blacks", an extract from the "South Wales News" which is as follows:- 'GORE, a forward who would be an acquisition to any pack of Forwards - on his showing at Pontypridd. Gore is one of the greatest Forwards Wales has ever produced - would secure a 'place' in any National side for which he was qualified'
Jack qualified to play for England because of his Fathers nationality.
Jack made his debut for Salford v St Helens on 28 February 1925 in the second row before quickly being switched to Loose Forward No 13 with great effect. Jack made 125 appearances for Salford between 1925 and 1928 scoring 29 tries. He played his last game for salford at Barrow on April 9, 1928. He was transferred to Wigan Highfield during the close season.
Jack then played for Wigan from 1928 until 1932 making 109 appearances and scoring 17 tries. 
Jack eventually returned to his birth town of Blaina where he ran the local Kings Head pub. Jcak was often suspected of being a rugby league spy for Salford. It is reported that he was instrumental in spotting the great Dai Watkins, also from Blaina who followed Jack to Salford after his days as a Welsh International rugby star.

Alcester Academy (formerly known as Alcester High School Technology College) is a state secondary school that educates girls and boys aged between 11 and 16, in Alcester, Warwickshire, England. It serves both Alcester and other surrounding villages such as Bidford-on-Avon.
History.
Alcester High School is located on the site of the old Greville High School (named after Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke) which opened in 1966. When Greville closed in 1985, the students were transferred to Alcester High along with students from Bidford High School. In 2004, a £1.8m expansion programme began creating a two-storey English block with 12 new classrooms, and extensions to the art and music blocks.
Technology.
Alcester High became a specialist technology college in 1998 with an investment of £250,000.
Music.
After being awarded 'high performing' status as a Technology College, Alcester High School was invited to apply for a second subject specialism. After a great deal of consultation and planning it was decided to apply for music specialism. This was approved by the Secretary of State for Education and the school became a specialist music college in 2006.

List of Knight's Cross recipients 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking

The 5th SS Panzer Division "Wiking" was a German Waffen SS division recruited from foreign volunteers. During the course of World War II, the division progressed from a motorised infantry, Regiment formation to a full-fledged Panzer division. It saw action on the Eastern Front during the war.
After the success of the Waffen SS during the early war campaigns in Poland and the West, it was decided to expand the number of Waffen SS divisions. Due to the influx of foreign volunteers, particularly from Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway, a decision was made to form a volunteer division. 
This unit, originally organized as the Nordische Division (Nr.5), was to be made up of Nordic volunteers mixed with ethnic German Waffen-SS veterans. To this end, the "Germania" motorised infantry regiment from the SS-Division "Verfügungstruppe" was removed from the division in late 1940. In December, "Germania" was dissolved and the troops were used as a basis for the formation of a new SS motorised formation, now to be designated SS-Division (mot.) "Germania". During its formative period, the division's name was changed again, to SS-Division (mot.) "Wiking". in January 1941. 
The division was formed around three motorised infantry regiments: "Germania", formed mostly from ethnic Germans; "Westland", consisting mainly of Dutch and Flemish volunteers; and "Nordland", composed mostly of Danes, Swedes and Norwegians. Command of the newly formed division was given to SS-Brigadeführer Felix Steiner, the former commander of the "Verfügungstruppe" "Deutschland" Regiment.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573" of September 1, 1939 instituted the Iron Cross and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. As the war progressed some of the recipients distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849" of June 3, 1940. In 1941 two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613" of September 28, 1941 introduced the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the last and final grade, the Knight's Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11" of December 29, 1944 concluded the variants of the Knight's Cross.
Prerequisites.
To qualify for the Knight's Cross, a soldier had to already hold the 1939 Iron Cross First Class, though the Iron Cross I Class was awarded concurrently with the Knight's Cross in rare cases.
Unit commanders could also be awarded the medal for exemplary conduct by the unit as a whole.
Grades.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was divided into five grades, excluding the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross:

No Justice

No Justice is a Red Dirt/Texas Country band which is originally from Stillwater, Oklahoma.
History.
The band was formed in 2001. It has its origins in a covers band that included Jerry Payne and two of the other original members, adopting the name No Justice. They began writing original songs and recruited singer Steve Rice.
In September 2007, No Justice released their first live album, "Live at Billy Bob's" CD/DVD, joining a long list of artists in the Live at Billy Bob's series. Originally released as a limited edition CD/DVD combo, it was re-released in 2008 with the full track listing. The album included the band's more popular songs from the previous albums, as well as three new tracks, two of which were also included as studio recordings. At the end of the last track of live recording, the band included their own version of U2's "With or Without You", from the 1987 album "The Joshua Tree". A cover of Ryan Adams' "Shakedown on 9th Street", from the 2000 album "Heartbreaker" is included, as well as a cover version of Todd Snider's "Horseshoe Lake", from the 2005 album "That Was Me: Best Of". The original limited edition issue consisted of CD containing a condensed version of the live recording, as well as a DVD of the concert and bonus features, including a photo gallery and interviews with the band.
By late 2009, the group had landed a new record deal with Carved Records. In 2010, the band's lineup was singer/guitarist Steve Rice, guitarist Jerry Payne, bassist Joey Treviño (who joined in 2008), drummer Armando Lopez and lead guitarist Cody Patton.
"2nd Avenue" (2010) was more rock-oriented than their earlier work, but the band returned to their roots with "America's Son" (2012), produced by Dexter Green. By 2012 the band's lineup was Rice, Patton, Lopez, vocalist/bassist Justin Morris, and keyboard player Bryce Conway.

Libouchec

Libouchec () is a village and municipality ("obec") in Ústí nad Labem District in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic.
The municipality covers an area of , and has a population of 1,869 (as at 31 December 2007).
Libouchec lies approximately north of Ústí nad Labem and north of Prague.
Libouchec is situated in the valley of Jilovsky brook, which separates the Czech Central Mountains and the Elbe Sandstone Mountains.
History.
Already in the 10th and 11th century were established two fortresses (in today's Jílové and in Libouchec). Later, in the 13th century, was established around this royal stronghold new village Libouchec. Its original name was Regis Silva (Königswald). But the first official mention was in a chronicle in 1169. The first settlers were Celts and Germans, later (from the 5th century) just Slavic peoples.
There was a very important Salt trail through Libouchec. Salt was carrying from here to Děčín where it was embarked and sent to inland. There started an important production in manufacture in the end of feudalism (buttons, textile, primitive machines). The nobility from Bynov began in the 16th century with logging, mining of ore and silver. In the 19th century was its surroundings industrial region. There began the production of velvet, liqueurs, mustard and agricultural machines.
Very important was also the railway which has led from Duchcov to Děčín. It was built in 1869 by Mr. Zacharias and was the most expensive railway being built at that time. Unfortunately the running of it was canceled in 2008.
The most important buildings in Libouchec are The Church of the Three St. Kings and the castle. The church was built in 1357, but after burning out it was repaired in the 16th century and from that time has been many time rebuilt. The castle (its original name was Schönstein) was established by Günter from Bünau in the 16th century. From that time has the castle weathered lots of things (Thirty Years' War, fires...) and it has been in the emergency conditions. In 2003 the castle was sold and has since been repaired.

Photodetection

In his historic paper entitled "The Quantum Theory of Optical Coherence," Roy J. Glauber set a solid foundation for the quantum electronics/quantum optics enterprise. The experimental development of the optical maser and later laser at that time had made the classical concept of optical coherence inadequate. Glauber started from the quantum theory of light detection by considering the process of photoionization in which a photodetector is triggered by an ionizing absorption of a photon. In the quantum theory of radiation, the electric field operator in the Coulomb gauge may be written as the sum of positive and negative frequency parts 
where 
One may expand formula_3 in terms of the normal modes as follows:
where formula_5 are the unit vectors of polarization; this expansion has the same form as the classical expansion except that now the field amplitudes formula_6 are operators. 
Glauber showed that, for an ideal photodetector situated at a point formula_7 in a radiation field, the probability of observing a photoionization event in this detector between time formula_8 and formula_9 is proportional to formula_10, where
and formula_12 specifies the state of the field. Since the radiation field is a quantum-mechanical one, we do not know the exact properties of the incident light, and the probability should be averaged, as in the classical theory, to be proportional to
where the angular brackets mean an average over the light field. The significance of the quantum theory of coherence is in the ordering of the "creation" and "destruction" operators formula_14 and formula_6:
Since formula_17 is not equal to formula_18 for a light field, the order makes the quantum statistical measurements (such as photon counting) quite different from the classical ones, i.e., the nonclassical properties of light, such as photon antibunching.
Moreover, Glauber's theory of photodetection is of far-reaching fundamental significance to interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Glauber detection theory differs from the Born probabilistic interpretation, in that it expresses the meaning of physical law in terms of measured facts (relationships), counting events in the detection processes, without assuming the particle model of matter. These concepts quite naturally lead to a relational approach to quantum physics.

<doc id="20004035" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20004035" title="Big wall climbing">
Big wall climbing

Big wall climbing is a type of rock climbing where a climber ascends a long-pitch route, normally requiring more than a single day to complete the climb. Big wall routes require the climbing team to live on the route often using portaledges and hauling equipment. It is practiced on tall or more vertical faces with few ledges and small cracks.
History.
In the early 20th century, climbers were scaling big rock faces in the Dolomites and the European Alps employing free- and aid- climbing tactics to create bold ascents. Yet, the sheer walls were waiting to be climbed by future generation with better tools and methods. 
In addition many nations in the early 1900s had specialized army units that had developed wall climbing skills for gaining surprise entry into enemy fortifications by wall climbing. In the early 1900s the 'Filipino Scouts', an US Army unit composed of Filipino enlisted and American officers, demonstrated their specialized skills by climbing the steep walls of a Spanish era fortification in Manilla, then bested that demonstration by climbing the same wall again only bringing a battery of mountain howitzers this time to the top of the wall. 
In the late 1950s big wall climbing finally started. In Yosemite, the northwest face of Half Dome was climbed in 1957 and the southeast buttress of El Capitan in 1958. With the invention of hard iron pitons, jumars and hammocks, wall climbing exploded in the 1960s and 1970s.
Following those pioneering achievements, parties began routinely setting off prepared for days and days of un-interrupted climbing on very long, hard, steep routes. The food, water, hardware and shelter necessary for such a climb could easily weigh well into the hundreds of pounds. Hauling systems were developed for managing these large loads.
In the last few decades, techniques for big wall climbing have evolved, due to greater employment of free-climbing and advances in speed climbing. The routes that used to routinely take days can be climbed in under 24 hours. Nevertheless, many parties still do make multi-day ascents of classic "trade routes" which have recently gone mostly free and very fast. Only a small handful of elite and exceptionally well-prepared climbers are capable of feats such as free-climbing the entirety of most classic Grade VI routes, or of speed-climbing such routes in a matter of hours.
Hauling.
In order to haul portaledges and other gear such as ropes, food, and water up a rock face, the gear is put in a bag ("haul bag" or "Pig") and pulled up to the next belay station. There are many different mechanically advantageous systems that are utilized to make pulling up the "haul bag" easier than simply dragging it up the face. There are several available methods but most tend to employ a counterweight system or a hauling system.
Gear is usually spread over many haul bags (usually packed so that they weigh between 30 and 40 kilograms) in order to maximize efficiency and prevent loss of equipment if a bag is lost. The hauling system usually consists of a self-locking pulley in order to capture the motion and prevent the bag from descending once hauling stops. Next, an ascender clamped to the haul rope is used to pull the haul line through the pulley.

Derastus Clapp

Derastus Clapp (May 1, 1792 – June 1, 1881) was head of the first city detective bureau in the United States, located in Boston, Massachusetts. He was appointed to the office of constable by the elderly Mayor Josiah Quincy in 1828, and was reappointed every succeeding year to 1874. In 1848, he was promoted to be one of the first detectives in the city. Clapp is most noted for his role in the arrest and prosecution of John White Webster for the murder of George Parkman.
Biography.
Clapp was born in Claremont, New Hampshire, but soon moved to Boston, after his marriage to Susannah Bowditch of Braintree, Massachusetts on February 15, 1818. He established an auction house, over which he presided for several years before he was appointed to the office of constable for the City of Boston in 1828. In 1832 and 1836, he was also captain of a ward militia company. According to an interview in the "Boston Traveller" on October 26, 1874, Clapp stated that "136 prisoners arrested by him were sent to the State Prison, and several hundred to the House of Correction, and that many thousand dollars worth of stolen property have been recovered by him and restored to its owners." He gained renown during his tenure as constable as "a successful detecter of crime" whose name would conjure "dread...among those who had reason to fear an arrest." There were reports that he would instill fear in the guilty without even approaching them. In 1850, most of the dread was harbored by school-aged children, as he was also an appointed truant officer. He and his assistant literally carried hundreds of children from all parts of the city back to the public school system.
In 1849, Clapp caught his "big break". A prestigious member of the Boston Brahmins was reported missing. Clapp's role in the investigation of the disappearance of Dr. George Parkman propelled him into international fame. His fame was short-lived, however, and in 1854, Boston established its first uniformed police force, with Constable Clapp as its less prominent member. His sole concern was ticketing illegally parked traffic on State Street and serving orders of notice issued by the City Clerk. In January 1874, a muscle tear in his right leg disabled him, but he continued his duties until October of that year. He retired on October 1, 1874 after 46 years of service.
Derastus Clapp and the disappearance of Dr. Parkman.
During 1849-50, Derastus Clapp participated in the investigation of the disappearance of Dr. George Parkman and the subsequent arrest and trial of Professor John White Webster for the murder of Parkman. Clapp's experience before this event was centered on less heinous crimes, such as burglary and counterfeiting, and he was initially unprepared for the demands required when dealing with homicide among the Boston elite.
November 23, 1849, was the last day Dr. Parkman was seen. Parkman's family notified Charles M. Kingsley, Parkman's business manager, that the doctor never returned home for lunch. The next day, November 24, he began a search of the city along with a half dozen police officers and a group of concerned citizens. The search continued as the family posted notices offering a reward of $3,000 for information related to Parkman's disappearance. Based on information acquired during the search, on November 26, 1849, Clapp, in addition to Kingsley and other officers, began focusing on the Harvard Medical College and surrounding areas. During the search of the college, Clapp made his deference to the upper class apparent. According to trial testimony by Mr. Kinsley, Clapp stated to Professor Webster that he was just following orders and no one in the college was a suspect. Clapp's hesitancy during the search is also on record. While searching Webster's laboratory, he started opening a door to a small room. When Webster told him that he kept his valuable and dangerous articles there, Mr. Clapp put his head as far as the door and turned back again, saying, "I will not go in to be blowed up."
As the investigation continued, and suspicion fell on the college as the scene of the crime, Clapp became more aggressive. The college's janitor, Ephraim Littlefield, had been conducting his own investigation, and found what were later to be identified as Dr. Parkman's remains under Webster's private privy. On November 30, a week after Parkman's disappearance, Clapp was again called to the college, where he was the first to view Littlefield's gruesome discovery. He was dispatched to Webster's house to make the arrest.
Clapp was not going to be made the fool twice. Having experience with the "rogues" of Boston, Clapp called upon his "devious Yankee" skills to lure the professor out of his house and into jail. He took a coach and two other officers for back-up and rode to Cambridge to the Webster residence. Leaving the coach and the other officers parked away from the house, Clapp approached Webster on his porch as he was escorting out a visitor. He requested Webster accompany him to the college to perform another search. Webster went back inside to get his hat and coat, but when he saw the coach and other officers, he suddenly remembered his keys. Clapp deterred his efforts to return to the house and told him they had keys enough to get in, "it was of no consequence."
Webster boarded silently as Clapp instructed the driver to go over Craigie's Bridge, where the police had been searching the waters earlier. After a few minutes of desultory conversation, Clapp broached the subject of the search efforts for the doctor and the progress the police had made. Webster confessed he had seen Dr. Parkman the week prior at the college, but the doctor had left the campus, still alive. During their conversation, the coach turned on to Brighton Street, and Webster became very agitated. "The driver is going the wrong way." Clapp tried to calm him by telling him the driver was "probably green" and would get it straightened out. When they stopped in front of the jail, Webster knew something was wrong. "What does this all mean?" Clapp escorted him into the jail and charged him with the murder of Dr. George Parkman.
Detective Clapp and the other officers continued their efforts while Webster was incarcerated. On December 5, 1849, Clapp executed a warrant to search the Webster house, meticulously and overtly following proper procedures during the course of the search. Evidence acquired during the search provided motive for the court to proceed in the prosecution of Professor John White Webster.
Although Derastus Clapp retired from the police force in 1874, he continued to serve in public office and retained his notoriety. In 1896, fifteen years after his death, a small paragraph in an Ohio paper noted:
They have extremely venerable policeman in
Boston, Mr. Derastus Clapp.
Who is ninety years old, has been in the
department about forty-four years, and is
at present in the special service of the
board of street commissioners.

This event was the lightest of the men's powerlifting weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of of body mass. Powerlifters were divided into two groups, A and B, with group B beginning their lifts at 13:00 and group A at 13:45.
As with all Paralympic powerlifting events, lifters competed in the bench press. Each athlete was allowed three attempts to bench press as much weight as possible. Athletes attempting to break a record were allowed a fourth attempt. For the attempt to be valid, the competitor must have lowered the weighted bar to his chest, held it motionless for a moment, then pressed the bar upwards until his arms were fully extended. If the competitor failed to meet these requirements or any other rule infraction was committed, the attempt was declared invalid by a team of three referees and the result struck from the record.

The building was designed by the Reid Brothers architects in 1914 and served as headquarters and the offices of newspaper, "The San Francisco Call" after its building The Call Building was damaged in the great fire.
The site was selected for its central location, which quickly became a regional media hub during that time period. From 1914 to 1950 The Montgomery was the home to "The San Francisco Call" and at times the offices of rival publications as well. From 1950 until 2005 building continued to be utilized as premium commercial office space. In 2005, a team of developers took over the project, close to the Civic Center, the Financial District and Union Square, and converted it into a luxury residential building.
Today there are 107 new residences at 74 New Montgomery. The new developers installed new electrical wiring (including CAT 5), new windows designed to preserve the classic aesthetics, and a seismic retrofit to the foundation.

Rodney Power Station

The Rodney Power Station is a proposal for a natural gas fired combined cycle power station developed by Genesis Energy Limited.
The power station, if built, would be located on a 48 ha site midway between Helensville and Kaukapakapa on State Highway 16, near the Kaipara Harbour, north west of Auckland. The proposed development includes substantial upgrade or replacement of the Helensville waste water treatment plant, which the local council would otherwise have to fund.
The plant is designed to use high efficiency combined cycle gas turbine technology to meet the increasing demand for electricity in the north Auckland region. The location will also assist to ease constraints on HV electricity transmission.
In its assessment of Transpower's proposal to upgrade HV transmission to north of Auckland, the Electricity Commission considered that the Rodney power station project provided a generation alternative to transmission.
Consenting.
Genesis Energy's applications for resource consents including air discharges were notified for public submissions in April 2008, a public hearing was held in September and the resource consents were granted by Auckland Regional Council in December 2008.
The project was opposed by some local residents, Greenpeace and the Green Party.
Land use resource consents for the power station were granted by Rodney District Council in March 2009. A variation to the District Plan created a thermal energy generation rural zone between Helensville and Kaukapakapa.
Although resource consents and the District Plan provisions are in place, Genesis does not intend to proceed with construction in the near future. The resource consents allow Genesis a period of 15 years in which to build the plant.

Chad Taylor (writer)

Chad Taylor (born 1964) is a New Zealand writer.
Life.
Chad Taylor is a New Zealand author of novels, short stories and screenplays. He was born in Auckland. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Elam and worked as assistant editor on "Rip It Up". He was the recipient of the Buddle Findlay Sargeson Fellowship for literature in 2001 and the University of Auckland Literary Fellow in 2003. His work has been translated in Germany, Italy and France. In 2006 he was one of 12 New Zealand authors invited to tour France for Les Belles Etrangeres. He appeared at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2012. He currently resides in New Zealand.
Work.
Taylor's style can be described as neo-noir. His themes include murder and love, sex, reality, identity and life in an intense, urban environment. "The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature" (1998) described him as:
A writer of uncompromisingly contemporary fictions of transience and shifting realities in the modern city. Born and educated in Auckland, where his work is largely set, he graduated BFA at Elam and has carried that interest into the strong visual quality of his writing... The fictions often work on the edge of such conventions as the murder story ('No Sun, No Rain'), futuristic fantasy ('Somewhere in the 21st Century') or romance triangle ("Pack of Lies", 'Calling Doctor Dollywell'), often through unreliable or unattractive narrators... As these literary norms are subverted, perceptions of reality and identity are challenged. Strong visual representations, especially of sex and clothing, and filmic treatment with fragmentary and mobile scenes and chronology, provide metaphorical access to these internal concerns.
Guardian Critic Maxim Jakubowski described Taylor's novel "Electric" (2003) as "entropy noir" and praised "Shirker" (2000) for its "existential anomie."
Much more ambitious, and weaving a seductive web of existential anomie, is Chad Taylor's "Shirker", a fascinating and obsessive novel from New Zealand with shades of Paul Auster's "New York Trilogy". Ellerslie Penrose, a part-time futures broker, finds a junkie's body in an Auckland dumpster, steals his wallet and embarks on a hallucinatory journey into the shadow life of the dead man. This brings him into contact with fantasy bordellos, mysterious manuscripts, bizarre antiques dealers, and a sleazy nest of quirky happenstance. Oddly detached from its subject matter, this is as hypnotic as they come; it's also miles away from the conventions of your average country-cottage crime or pig-headed cop yarn. One for the connoisseurs.
Taylor acknowledged the "noir" label in a 2009 interview:
I’ve basically deconstructed crime novels: I’ve taken aspects of crime novels, rewritten them, taken them apart. People used to ask me, “What do you write?”... I just don’t know. But you have come up with a word for what you do. ‘Noir’ kind of fits it.
In 1998, his novel "Heaven" was made into a feature film by Miramax. The film was produced by Sue Rogers, directed by Scott Reynolds and starred Martin Donovan. Taylor has also written for film including the original screenplay for the short film "Funny Little Guy" (1994), directed by Chris Graves. In May 2003 the NZ Listener listed him as one of "New Zealand's Top Ten Novelists Under 40."
"Electric" (2003) is set in Auckland during the power cuts that blacked out the city in 1998. "Time Out London" selected the novel as Book of the Week on Jan 22, 2003. "Time Out" critic Roger Howard described "Electric" as a story of chaos and urban malaise:
His setting is a New Zealand you won't see in "Lord of the Ring"s: a city suffering from the same urban malaise as glitzier metropolises on other continents. Our protagonist, Samuel Usher, is a drug addict who supports himself by recovering data from damaged computers. He falls in with a couple of drifters who occupy themselves with recondite mathematics. But the favoured activity for all three involves powders on polished surfaces. When Jules dies in mysterious circumstances, Usher sets off to find out why. Thematically, Taylor's concerns are twofold: the infinite extent of digitised culture; and the limitless flood of narcotics (not to mention the global industry behind it). "Electric" looks at what happens when chaos rises up to warp these apparently unassailable worlds.
The novel "Departure Lounge" (2006) is based on the 1979 "Erebus crash". "Washington Post" critic Jonathan Yardley compared the novel's style to Raymond Chandler:
His style owes a lot to Raymond Chandler and lesser apostles of noir, but at the same time it's very much his own. His prose is spare but with a strong undercurrent of emotion; "cool" certainly is the word for him, but there's a good deal of heat beneath.
"Houston Chronicle" critic P.G. Koch described "Departure Lounge" as a crime novel that played with expectations of the genre:
New Zealand writer Chad Taylor plays with the crime/noir genre for his own philosophical purposes in an open-ended way that subverts reassuring convention. In "Departure Lounge", we first glimpse a newscast tragedy — a plane that has vanished in Antarctica — before moving on to the book's narrator, Mark Chamberlain, as he shoots pool with Rory, a real estate developer who is short on scruples and whose apartment Mark later burgles... For all its nighttime street life of taxis and clubs, this is an oddly silent book. It is as if we move through its impeccable structure seeking resolution the same way that Mark ghosts through all those houses he breaks into. Taylor in effect has taken the not-knowing at the mystery genre's core and enshrined it, occupied its amorphous territory and made of it, as in this slight book's emotional peak, a luminous art.
In 2008 UK "Guardian" critic Maxim Jakubowski described Chad Taylor as a cult author:
Taylor is a minimalist whose tortured characters populate a world where silence and night form a disconsolate backdrop for their musings and meanderings across a landscape of bleak, concrete cities... (He has) a profound empathy for the losers in our midst and an acute sense of place and the bizarre in everyday life.
Taylor's 2009 novel "The Church of John Coltrane" (2009) was a sequel to "Heaven".
In 2013 New Zealand director Jonathan King began filming Taylor's original screenplay "REALITi" in Wellington, New Zealand. The film is a science fiction / noir set in the near future. Taylor has described it as a "talkie" and "a science fiction film with no special effects." The cast of "REALITi" includes Nathan Meister, Michelle Langstone, Miranda Manasiadis, Graham McTavish , Tim Wong and Aroha White.

Ash Hill

Ash Hill, or Hitching Post Hill, is a two-story brick dwelling erected ca. 1840, and located on Rosemary Lane, in Hyattsville, Prince George's County, Maryland. The house was built by Robert Clark, an Englishman who was seeking space and quiet in contrast to the crowded city of Washington, D.C. In 1875, General Edward Fitzgerald Beale bought the property. Beale entertained luminaries such as President U.S. Grant (a close personal friend who kept his two Arabian horses, Leopard and Linden, stabled at Ash Hill), President Grover Cleveland and Buffalo Bill Cody. The house, with its foot-thick brick walls and hilltop site, is an imposing one, made even more so by the massive pillared porch which surrounds it on three sides. The porch was added by Admiral Chauncey Thomas who purchased the property in 1895.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

William Pitt Smith (1760–1796) was a U.S. physician, educator and theological writer.
Smith began his career serving in the General Hospital Department of the Continental Army during the American Revolution. He became Professor of Materia Medica at Columbia College) in 1792.
Smith authored two books that espoused the tenets of Universalism: "The Universalist; in Seven Letters to Amyntor" (1787) and "Observations on Conventions" (1793). In his books, Smith argued that the notion of infinite and universal sin contradicted God's basic nature. Smith’s writing also spoke positively of deism, noting its practitioners were “of amiable characters, or sense, learning and morality,” and he argued that Universalism could serve as a bridge to connect the theological separation between deists and Christians.
Smith was elected as a member of the New York State legislature in January 1796, where he argued for the abolition of slavery. However, his political term was brief, as he died in February 1796 following complications from pneumonia.

Third Battle of Manzanillo

The Third Battle of Manzanillo was fought in the harbor of Manzanillo, Cuba on July 18, 1898. A large squadron of the United States Navy consisting of gunboats and auxiliaries attacked and cleared the harbor of a comparable force of Spanish vessels in the third largest naval battle of the Spanish American War.
Background.
Manzanillo had been a refuge for blockade runners and gunboats since the beginning of the war, and the United States navy had sent two reconnaissance expeditions to the harbor to determine its defenses. An expedition made up of the gunboat USS "Hist", USS "Hornet", and USS "Wompatuck" attempted to clear the harbor on June 30 and a second force made up of USS "Osceola" and USS "Scorpion" was sent and repulsed on July 1. Both attacks on the harbor were failed due to superior numbers of Spanish Naval forces. What few ships were sunk in these attacks were refloated and repaired leaving the largest remaining Spanish naval force in Cuba relatively intact. As a result of the failure of the two previous squadrons to eliminate the Spanish gunboats at Manzanillo, Commander Marix requested for armoured vessels to be sent in order to ensure the next assault would be successful. Although Marix had requested heavier units the Navy sent him the gunboats USS "Wilmington" and USS "Helena". The American squadron now under command of C. C. Todd, captain of the "Wilmington", set off on July 18 to clear Manzanillo harbor of Spanish presence once and for all. One fort and one shore battery with ten guns protected the harbor and about 1,000 riflemen were at these positions and were in sight of American forces.
Battle.
The American commander split his force into three sections so as to prevent any Spanish forces from escaping the harbor. The two gunboats "Wilmington" and "Helena" entered via a channel on the northern side of the bay attacking from the left, "Osceola" and "Scorpion" attacked from a channel directly opposite the city, and the other three American vessels moved in from the right through one of the bays southern channels. All three of the American squadrons timed their passages through the channels to enter the bay concurrently. At 7:04 the battle began when Spanish batteries in the city sighted the Americans and opened fire, some 15 minutes later "Scorpion" and "Osceola" replied by attacking the shore batteries. As soon as they were in range "Wilmington" and "Helena" began attacking the merchant steamers "El Gloria" and "Jose Garcia" as well as the blockade runner "El Purísima Concepción". Several of the Spanish gunboats in the harbor sailed out to challenge the American fleet but were repulsed by heavy fire. "Hist", "Hornet", and "Wompatuck" pursued the gunboats to their moorings and engaged them.
The American vessels continued to advance on the harbor but were hampered because of the shallow depth of Manzillio's bay forcing them to reconnoiter passages so that the deeper drafted gunboats would not beach themselves. Advancing upon the Spanish positions, Commander Todd realized that his forces were focusing to much of their fire upon transports taking refuge in the harbor as well as the hulk "Maria" which had been converted to an armed immobile pontoon, he ordered the "Helena" to engage the more dangerous gunboats instead of assisting the "Wilmington" in engaging the targets of lesser importance. "Helena" then changed targets and began to systematically engage the Spanish gunboats. Three of these caught fire and exploded while one grounded on the beach and sunk while another grounded and was thought to have been disabled, she was later scuttled. By the end of the battle the entire Spanish flotilla at Manzanillo had been destroyed or disabled. At 10:22 Todd gave the order for the American forces to withdraw and had the "Helena" lay down suppressing fire while the rest of the squadron sailed out of the harbor.
Aftermath.
By 10:35 the battle was over. The Spanish lost five gunboats, three transports and one pontoon while the Americans took no casualties. The only significant damage the Americans took was a three pounder gun that broke loose from its rivets on the "Wompatuck" though one of USS "Wilmington"s guns was disabled due to enemy fire for a few minutes. The threat posed by the Spanish flotilla was eliminated, and the American squadron returned to the main fleet, with "Wompatuck" leaving the rest of the victorious vessels and instead arriving at Guantanamo Bay to bring the Admiral news of the latest American victory. Although the Spanish naval presence in Manzanillo was eliminated Spanish troops still controlled the town and it would not be until the very end of the war that Manzanillo fell to American troops after a fiece bombardment of the city and attack by Cuban insurgents.

<doc id="20004303" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20004303" title="Teche Greyhound Lines">
Teche Greyhound Lines

The Teche Greyhound Lines (called also Teche or TGL), a highway-coach carrier, was a Greyhound regional operating company, based in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, from 1934 until 1954, when it (along with the Dixie Greyhound Lines) was merged into the Southeastern Greyhound Lines, a neighboring operating company.
pronounced as "tesh", is a word of French origin, a word ("téche") for "snake" – due to a legend (about a large snake in the region) which the natives had told to the early French traders and explorers – from the name of the Bayou Teche in the swamp country in coastal Louisiana. 
Correction note: Not named Teche because of a big snake in the region; but, because the Bayou Teche has a snakelike appearance as it meanders through the land curving this way and then that way, similar to snakelike movements.
Origin.
The Teche Greyhound Lines (GL) began as the Teche Transfer Company, which became incorporated in Louisiana in April 1920 to operate buses between Jeanerette and New Iberia (a distance of about 10 miles in the region west of New Orleans and Baton Rouge and southeast of Lafayette). The firm then began to grow in steps.
In 1929 the Teche Transfer Company became renamed as the Teche Lines, then in 1932 it began to use the hyphenated brand name, trade name, or service name of the Teche-Greyhound Lines (with the consent of The Greyhound Corporation, the parent Greyhound firm), while at first retaining its own corporate name (until 1934) – after it entered into a through-traffic agreement with Greyhound, and after Greyhound began to buy a minority interest in Teche (which interest continued to grow).
Wheeling and dealing.
In 1929 the Old South Coach Lines came into existence – to buy (from the Alabama Bus Company) a short branch line (with a length of about 59 miles), between Birmingham and Tuscaloosa (both in Alabama), then promptly extended about 93 more miles (by application rather than purchase) from Tuscaloosa to Meridian (in Mississippi).
The next year, 1930, the Teche Lines bought the Old South Coach Lines, thereby completing its route between New Orleans and Birmingham.
same year, 1930, the Alabama Bus Company – which in 1929 had sold its branch line from Birmingham to Tuscaloosa (to the Old South Coach Lines) – became bought by and merged into the Consolidated Coach Corporation (which in 1936 became renamed as the Southeastern Greyhound Lines) – thereby extending Consolidated from Chattanooga (in Tennessee) through Birmingham and Montgomery to Mobile (all three in Alabama) – the entire length of the "Heart of Dixie".
The Old South Lines (entirely different from the Old South "Coach" Lines) was a property of John Gilmer, who previously (in 1925) had founded the Camel City Coach Company, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which (in 1929) became the southern half of the National Highway Transport (NHT) Company, based in Charleston, West Virginia, which (in 1931) became renamed as the Atlantic Greyhound Lines. 
In 1933 the Old South Lines started running between Charlotte (in North Carolina) and Atlanta (in Georgia) and between Columbia (in South Carolina) and Atlanta.
Gilmer’s Old South Lines in 1934 bought the route between Montgomery and Atlanta (including an alternate loop through Columbus in Georgia) – from the Hood Coach Lines, which on that route had begun its first service (in 1930 between Atlanta and Columbus, then in 1933 onward to Montgomery), and which had soon tried (unsuccessfully) to run additional routes between Atlanta and Macon (in Georgia), between Macon and Savannah (in Georgia), and between Macon and Jacksonville (in Florida) via Waycross (in Georgia).
[Hood in November 1934 sold also the latter routes – to the Consolidated Coach Corporation and the Union Bus Company (acting jointly), with the Atlanta-Macon and Macon-Waycross-Jacksonville routes going to Consolidated (which in 1936 became renamed as the Southeastern Greyhound Lines) and with the Macon-Savannah route going to Union (which in 1941 was bought by and merged into the Southeastern GL) – thereby gaining for Consolidated and Union (and therefore later for Greyhound) not only a new route between Macon and Savannah and a parallel alternate route between Atlanta and Macon but also a quicker alternate route between Macon and Jacksonville (about 50 miles shorter than its older route via Valdosta in Georgia and Lake City in Florida). 
After that last sale the Hood firm, no longer holding any other route, went out of business.
In 1935 the Atlantic GL bought the Old South routes to Atlanta from Charlotte and from Columbia, thereby preparing to establish connections in Atlanta with the Teche GL and the Southeastern GL.
In February 1936 Teche bought the Old South route between Montgomery and Atlanta (with the loop through Columbus), thereby completing its route between New Orleans and Atlanta.
Background and participation of O.W. Townsend.
O.W. Townsend, who in 1932 obtained control of the Teche Lines, had begun in the highway-coach industry in 1924 when he founded the Cornhusker Stage Lines (based in Hastings, Nebraska, running between Hastings and Lincoln, the capital of the Cornhusker State), which in 1927 became a link in the chain of independently owned carriers which (acting separately but cooperatively) operated under the collective name of the YellowaY Lines (in an attempt to reach from coast to coast). 
Soon under the YellowaY name Townsend ran his coaches across Nebraska between Chicago (in Illinois) and Denver (in Colorado) – and maybe onward to Salt Lake City (in Utah). 
In 1928 Townsend sold some (but not all) of his rights (in the routes of the Cornhusker Stage Lines) to the newly formed American Motor Transportation Company, which bought also most of the other independent YellowaY member firms, and which then operated them as the YellowaY-Pioneer System. 11 September 1928 a YellowaY-Pioneer coach completed the first regularly scheduled coast-to-coast bus trip in the US (from Los Angeles to New York City) by a single operating company.
In 1929 the Motor Transit Corporation (called also MTC) bought the Yelloway-Pioneer System, and later in 1929 the MTC became renamed as The Greyhound Corporation. 
Townsend in 1929 sold his remaining property (including the remaining routes) in the Cornhusker Stage Lines to the Union Pacific (UP) Railroad, which merged it into its new Interstate Transit Lines, which in 1943 (along with the Union Pacific, UP, Stages, another bus subsidiary of the UP Railroad) began operating under the brand name, trade name, or service name of the Overland Greyhound Lines (after The Greyhound Corporation began to buy a minority interest in each of those two bus companies of the railroad), and both of which in 1952 became wholly owned subsidiaries of the parent Greyhound firm, then became merged, under the name of the Overland Greyhound Lines, as a division of The Greyhound Corporation.
Meanwhile, even before Townsend sold the remainder of Cornhusker to Interstate (that is, not later than 1929), he began another carrier – the Atlantic-Pacific Stages, running between Saint Louis (in Missouri) and Los Angeles (in California) via Kansas City (on the state line between Kansas and Missouri), Denver (in Colorado), and Albuquerque (in New Mexico) – which in 1930 he sold to the Interstate Transit, Inc., a completely different firm (different from the Interstate Transit Lines) with a confusingly similar name, operating as the Colonial Stages, which afterward became renamed as the Colonial Atlantic-Pacific Stages (called also CAPS), and which succumbed in 1932 during (and as a casualty of) the Great Depression. 
In 1931 and 1932 Townsend lived and worked in Philadelphia (in Pennsylvania) as the regional manager of the eastern end of the CAPS. 
After the second (and final) failure of the CAPS, Townsend moved to New Orleans (lawfully taking with him about 20 of the newer coaches, Macks of the model BK), bought a controlling interest in the Teche Lines, and began making deals with The Greyhound Corporation.
Further developments.
About 1934 Greyhound increased its partial ownership of the Teche Lines to a controlling (majority) interest, and Greyhound renamed Teche as the unhyphenated Teche Greyhound Lines; then in 1939 Greyhound bought also the last remaining minority interest of Townsend (first leaving the new Teche GL as a wholly owned subsidiary); and in 1941 Greyhound merged the TGL into itself as a division of the parent Greyhound firm.
By 1954 the TGL ran from New Orleans to Baton Rouge (in Louisiana), Natchez (in Mississippi), through Hammond (in Louisiana) to Jackson (in Mississippi and on the way to Memphis, Saint Louis, and Chicago), through Hattiesburg and Meridian (both in Mississippi) to Birmingham (in Alabama), through Mobile and Montgomery (both in Alabama) and Columbus (in Georgia) to Atlanta (in Georgia), through Mobile to Marianna (in Florida and on the way to Tallahassee and the rest of the Sunshine State), and westward through Lafayette to Lake Charles (both in Louisiana and on the way to Houston, the rest of Texas, and the rest of the West), plus along several regional and feeder routes in the southern part of the Pelican State.
The Teche GL met the Dixie GL to the north, the Southwestern GL to the west, and the Atlantic GL and the Southeastern GL to the east.
The TGL took part in major interlined through-routes (using pooled equipment in cooperation with other Greyhound companies) – that is, the use of through-coaches on through-routes running through the territories of two or more Greyhound regional operating companies – connecting New Orleans with Los Angeles, Houston, Memphis, Saint Louis, Chicago, Detroit, New York City, Washington, Jacksonville, Miami, and Saint Petersburg.
Merger into Southeastern GL.
In October 1954 The Greyhound Corporation merged Teche and a neighboring operating company, the Dixie GL (called also Dixie or DGL), based in Memphis, Tennessee, into the Southeastern GL (called also Southeastern, SEG, SEGL, or the SEG Lines), another neighboring regional company, based in Lexington, Kentucky. The three fleets of the three divisions became combined into a single fleet.
Thus ended the Teche GL.
Beyond Teche GL.
After that merger the newly expanded Southeastern GL served 12 states along 13,227 route-miles of highways – from Cincinnati (in Ohio), Saint Louis, Memphis, Natchez, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and Lake Charles – to Savannah and Jacksonville – from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Ohio River to the Gulf of Mexico.
In October 1957 The Greyhound Corporation merged also the Florida GL (called also FGL), one more neighboring operating company, based in Jacksonville, Florida, into the SEGL.
In November 1960 The Greyhound Corporation further merged the Atlantic GL (called also Atlantic or AGL), yet another neighboring regional company, based in Charleston, West Virginia, with – not into but rather "with" – the Southeastern GL, thereby creating the Southern Division of The Greyhound Corporation (called also the Southern GL), the third of four huge new divisions (along with Central, Eastern, and Western).
Thus ended the Southeastern GL, and thus began the Southern GL.
Later (about 1966) The Greyhound Corporation reorganized again, into just two humongous divisions, named as the Greyhound Lines East (GLE) and the Greyhound Lines West (GLW); even later (about 1970) it eliminated those two divisions, thus leaving a single gargantuan undivided nationwide fleet.
When the Southern GL came into existence, the headquarters functions became gradually transferred from Lexington, Kentucky, and Charleston, West Virginia, to Atlanta, Georgia; when GLE arose, many of those administrative functions became shifted from Atlanta to Cleveland, Ohio; eventually those functions migrated to Chicago, Illinois, then to Phoenix, Arizona, when (in 1971) The Greyhound Corporation moved its corporate headquarters from Chicago to a new building in Phoenix.
In 1987 The Greyhound Corporation (the original umbrella Greyhound firm), which had become widely diversified far beyond passenger transportation, sold its entire highway-coach operating business (its core bus business) to a new company, named as the Greyhound Lines, Inc., called also GLI, based in Dallas, Texas – a separate, independent, unrelated firm, which was the property of a group of private investors under the promotion of Fred Currey, a former executive of the Continental Trailways (later renamed as the Trailways, Inc., called also TWI, also based in Dallas), which was the largest member company in the Trailways trade association (then named as the National Trailways Bus System, now as the Trailways Transportation System).
Later in 1987 the Greyhound Lines, Inc., the GLI, the new firm based in Dallas, further bought also the Trailways, Inc., the TWI, its largest competitor, and merged it into the GLI.
The lenders and the other investors of the GLI ousted Fred Currey (as the chief executive officer) after the firm went into bankruptcy in 1990.
The GLI has continued to experience difficulties and lackluster performance under a succession of new owners and new executives – while continuing to reduce its level of service – by hauling fewer passengers aboard fewer coaches on fewer trips along fewer routes with fewer stops in fewer communities in fewer states – and by doing so on fewer days – that is, increasingly operating some trips less often than every day (fewer than seven days per week) – and by using fewer through-coaches, thus requiring passengers to make more transfers (from one coach to another).
After the sale to the GLI, The Greyhound Corporation changed its name to the Greyhound-Dial Corporation, then the Dial Corporation, then the Viad Corporation. contrived name Viad appears to be a curious respelling of the former name Dial – if one scrambles the letters D, I, and A, then turns the V upside down and regards it as the Greek letter lambda – Λ – that is, the Greek equivalent of the Roman or Latin letter L.
The website of the Viad Corporation (http://www.viad.com) in September 2008 makes no mention of its corporate history or its past relationship to Greyhound – that is, its origin as The Greyhound Corporation.

Candy pumpkin

A candy pumpkin is a small, pumpkin-shaped, mellowcreme confection primarily made from corn syrup, honey, wax, and sugar. Traditionally colored with an orange base and topped with a green stem to make candy pumpkins largely identifiable with Halloween, a candy pumpkin is considered a mellow creme by confectioners since the candy has a marshmallow flavor. Sometimes called candy corn's first cousin, candy pumpkins are made through a starch casting process similar to that for candy corn. Brach's candy pumpkin, known by the trademarked name "," is the most popular candy pumpkin. Brach's Confections is now owned by Farley's & Sathers Candy Company. Some say that a candy pumpkin tastes exactly like candy corn, while others say that it is better or worse than candy corn.
History.
Candy pumpkins are made using the same process to make candy corn. The candy corn process and product were created by George Renninger of the Wunderlee Candy Co. in the 1880s and became popular as a treat in the 1920s. Candy pumpkins first were produced in mid 20th century using a process similar to that of candy corn. Corn syrup, food coloring, honey, and sugar are beaten and heated in large kettles to produce an ultra-sweet syrup. This slurry generically is called "mellowcreme" by confectioners, since the resulting candy has a mellow, creamy texture. The mellowcreme slurry then was divided into two uneven amounts, with the large amount receiving orange food coloring and the smaller receiving green food coloring. A mogul machine brings the two colored mixtures together into a mold made of cornstarch, and the assembly is sent to a separate drying room to dry for 24 to 36 hours. Once dry, the candy is shaken violently to remove excess cornstarch and a final glaze is added to give the candy pumpkin a sheen. Candy pumpkins, acorns and other shapes that are derived from the mellowcreme slurry are often sold with candy corn under the name "harvest mix."
Impact.
Candy pumpkins are popular in part because the mellowcreme gives them "an interesting texture." As of 1988, most big confectionery companies, including Mars Inc., did not market special Halloween candies. The one exception was Brach's Confections, which made candy pumpkins among other seasonal products. Their "Mellowcreme Pumpkin" was made to look like an autumnal fruit; each pumpkin contained 25 calories and 5 grams sugar. In 1992, Brach's Confections expected to sell more than 30 million pounds of mellowcreme candy during the fall season, which included its seasonal mellowcreme pumpkins. You can also find the candy pumpkin in Brach's Autumn Mix.
By the late 1990s, competitors of Brach's realized that the market for the special Halloween candy pumpkin was expanding. For example, in 1997, candy pumpkins and other mellowcreme candies helped push annual spending on Halloween candy in the United States to an estimated $950 million a year. In response, Mars, Inc. came out with Snickers Creme Pumpkin in 1998. The milk chocolate-covered peanut and caramel candy was packaged in a 1.20 oz. size with a plastic wrapper featuring a jack-o-lantern on the package. At the time, the Snickers Creme Pumpkin retailed for 50 U.S. cents. Two years later, in 2000, Frankford Candy & Chocolate Company cross-licensed with ConAgra Foods to produce Peter Pan Peanut Butter Pumpkins. Peter Pan Peanut Butter Pumpkins included a "rich and creamy" Peter Pan peanut butter center pressed into a detailed pumpkin mold. At that time, the Peter Pan pumpkin candy was sold in 14 oz. bags. Also in 2000, Zachary Confections expanded its product line to include candy pumpkins.
In addition to helping characterize Halloween, candy pumpkins played a role in the current U.S. implementation of daylight saving time. Since the 1960s, candy makers had wanted to get the trick-or-treat period covered by Daylight Saving, reasoning that if children have an extra hour of daylight, they would collect more candy. During the 1985 U.S Congressional hearings on Daylight Saving, the industry went so far as to put candy pumpkins on the seat of every senator, hoping to win a little favor. On July 8, 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1986 into law; it contained a daylight saving rider which continued daylight saving time until the early morning of last Sunday in October; this did not include Halloween night. In 2005, daylight saving time was extended to the first Sunday in November—just long enough to include Halloween.

Hamlin Elementary School

Hamlin Elementary School is one of the elementary schools in the Rochester Community Schools system, located in Rochester Hills, Michigan. The principal is Gary Cornish, who has held that posision since September 1986.
History.
In 1836, the first of two wooden schoolhouses was built on the site. In 1837, Michigan became a state. At the time, Miss Charlotte Brook was the teacher. 
In 1902, a fire destroyed the first wooden schoolhouse, and a second wooden school was constructed where the front turnaround is located. 
Then in 1929, a three-room brick school was completed, including a furnace, incinerator, lockers, basement, and indoor bathrooms. 
There were 45 students the first year the building opened, but this number grew steadily. By 1954, a major addition was completed to include a gym, library, and five more classrooms. Minnie Thorpe-Carey became the principal of Hamlin after starting as a teacher in the early 1940s. Mrs. Thorpe-Carey retired in 1972 after overseeing two more additions to Hamlin. By 1972, twelve classrooms had been added, and the population had grown to over 600 students. Mr. Joseph Neubacher served as Hamlin's principal from 1972 to 1978, followed by Mr. Thomas Mikula from 1978 to 1983. In June 1983, Hamlin's doors closed due to declining enrollment. This marked the end of 147 consecutive years of education on this site. In September 1986, Hamlin once again served as an elementary school with Mr. Gary Cornish as Principal. In 1992, a total renovation and new additions were begun at Hamlin. In September 1993, staff and students of Hamlin moved into the newly constructed Hampton Elementary School for one full year while this major renovation took place to the school. In September 1994, staff and students returned to a renovated facility. Hamlin School features a full wall of over 800 tiles painted by students and staff during the 1992–93 school year. During the summer of 2006 the school received all new paint colors and new carpeting throughout.

Little Flock hymnbook

The Little Flock hymnbook is in common use amongst Exclusive Brethren in various editions which nevertheless derive from a common source. It exists in almost as many variations and editions as there are distinct groups of Exclusive Brethren.
Early history.
In 1838 (and again 1840) the Central Tract Depot published George Wigram's "Hymns for the Poor of the Flock". This was followed in 1856 by his "Hymns and Spiritual Songs for the Little Flock" which gathered together hymns from diverse collections used among Brethren and on which all subsequent versions are based. This was revised in 1881 by John Nelson Darby, an edition which is still in print, published by Bible Truth Publishers of Addison, Illinois, USA and available from Chapter Two, etc. William Kelly revised the hymn book in 1894 and Thomas Henry Reynolds produced his edition in 1903.
Raven/Taylor editions.
Amongst Raven–Taylor Brethren, every new doctrinal development has been reflected in renewed activity in hymn composition in English and other European languages. Doctrinal shifts were often followed by marked re-editing of the hymns themselves to bring them into line with current ministry which often necessitated the production of a new edition. The main editions are 1903, 1932, 1951, 1962, and 1973, of which there is a Taylor/Symington (1973 Amendment) edition and a separate Kingston Bible Trust (1973 Re-Selection) edition. From the 1940s, foreign language editions were gradually brought into line with English editions so that Brethren could, where possible, sing together the same hymns in the same metre. The 1962 hymnbook thus appears in varying quality in 10 or more languages. The Swedish editions in particular have a long tradition of translating English hymns, especially Gospel songs for outreach. The English editions themselves have included translations from Swedish, French, Spanish and German. Taylor/Symington/Hales Brethren use their English hymnbook universally regardless of the local language.
A new edition, "Hymns and Spiritual Songs for the Flock of God", was published in New Zealand in 2001 by R.D. Church and E.J. Forrest through the Joseph Bywater Trust. This collection is based on the 1951 edition and gathers together many hymns from all the pre-existing collections, restoring hymns to their original wording where possible and adding some new compositions.
Kelly/Lowe/Glanton editions.
The KLG grouping have had two major hymn books since William Kelly's "Hymns Selected and Revised in 1894" edition. Following the reunion of 'Kelly' (1894 users) and 'Lowe' Brethren (1881 users) in 1926, the 1928 edition was compiled by William John Hocking and is still in use by a few 'Kelly' and Open Brethren meetings. The 1978 edition followed the 1974 reunion with both 'Glanton' Brethren (1903 users) and 'Grant' Brethren (1881 users) and is used by these "reunited" Brethren. This latter book has drawn more widely from hymns in common use but does not contain hymns addressing the Holy Spirit in line with traditional Darbyite teaching. Foreign language editions have developed and continued in their own distinctive traditions.
Gospel hymnbooks.
Gospel hymnbooks have been produced by most branches of Exclusive Brethren. The "Little Flock" editions have always contained a selection of Gospel Hymns but both Raven/Taylor and KLG wings of the movement have from time to time used separate (sometimes privately printed) collections of Gospel Hymns in the gospel and outreach meetings. Chapter Two have re-published "The Evangelists' Hymnal", edited by Walter Thomas Prideaux Wolston. This book is used by some Glanton and some Open Brethren assemblies.
Tune books.
Little Flock Tune Books have been published in 1883, 1904, 1932, 1954, 1965, and 1979. Charles Theodore Lambert's edition of 1932 published both words and tunes with an appendix "Containing a few hymns suitable for the Christian Household". It is still published in Tonic Sol-Fa by the Symington/Hales Depot. The other Tune Books had tunes only, listed in metrical order. The KLG 1978 hymn book and the Gospel Hymn Book were both published with a music edition. All editions (but especially the 1965 edition) have drawn on Exclusive Brethren tunewriters and musicians to produce collections of a high calibre both in terms of musical editing and in the quality of the compositions themselves. Composers of note include Thomas Willey, T. Collins, Miss Marian La Thangue, Miss S.M. Walker, Charles Leflaive, C.T. Lambert, Benjamin Christiansen, R.A. Evershed, Peter S. Pope, Eric Carrén, John F. Harvey, and Gordon Millar.
Historical and critical apparatus.
An Access database of all first lines and metres of hymns with limited biographical and bibliographical material is held at the Christian Brethren Archive in the John Rylands University Library, Manchester.
Gordon Rainbow has collated some historical material on the Little Flock Hymnbook. This contains links to all the prefaces to the early hymnbooks and from 1903 follows the Raven/Taylor line of hymnbooks. Various accounts of new editions of the hymnbook were published and these are given in full.
An account of all the major developments in the tradition was published in Frank Wallace's "The History of the Little Flock Hymnbook" (it does maintain an anti-Taylor bias). Also by Frank Wallace, "Spiritual Songsters" contains biographies of many hymnwriters found in the Little Flock tradition and is published by Chapter Two.
Adrian Roach wrote a History of the 1881 edition containing much biographical information on the hymnwriters. It is published by Bible Truth Publishers.
A text of the 1978 Kelly/Lowe/Glanton edition is available online where there is a large amount of biographical material and a first line index of the 1881 "Darby" edition

Landstuhl Elementary Middle School

Landstuhl Elementary Middle School (LEMS) is a kindergarten through eighth grade Department of Defense Dependents School (DoDDS) located in Landstuhl, Germany. LEMS services the dependents of Department of Defense (DOD) personnel and contractors and is part of the Kaiserslautern District of DoDDS.
Buildings.
LEMS has a total of three buildings, two permanent and one temporary. The main building was originally constructed in 1955 and has been given additions ever since. The most recent of these is a 6½ million dollar addition completed in April 2008. The one remaining temporary building is now set to be torn down to make way for a new gymnasium, raising the total number of gymnasiums to three.
Bryan Walker's Eagle Project 2009.
During the 4th Quarter of school year 2008-2009, 14-year old Bryan Walker, a former student from LEMS and a current freshman at Kaiserslautern American High School completed a memorial recognizing the deaths of two persons who passed while attending LEMS; one a teacher and the other a student. Groundbreaking for this project was on May 8, 2009 and was completed on May 24, 2009. The project was completed by Boy Scout Troop 243 and had assistance from the 735th Civil Engineers based at Einsiedlerhof in Kaiserslautern, Germany. The construction at the school sparked attention from the local media with coverage from American Forces Network and the local newspaper, the Kaiserslautern American, or the KA as it is referred to as. News coverage for the project was aired on the morning radio and TV news report [http://kaiserslautern.afneurope.net/DynamicMenu/Home/ArticleDisplayDD/tabid/654/Default.aspx?aid=8474] The project, which cost around $1,500, was funded through fund raising at the local Commissary at nearby Ramstein Air Base and donations from the Officers' Spouses Club. It consisted of a Y-shaped memorial area with a rectangular center (it resembles the symbol for the Yen) and a granite bench within the rectangular area. There is a plaque embedded into the paved memorial, which reads ""In Memory of Those Who Once Walked This Campus"." Along with this, there is new foliage planted around the memorial area and the original plaques as well.
Accreditation.
LEMS is fully accredited by the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (NCA CASI). Every five years the school is visited by the NCA CASI to assess the success of the school's individual school improvement plan. The professional and auxiliary staff members at school complete an in-depth report which addresses one affective and one cognitive area that the school has chosen to address in an outcomes based school improvement plan. This self-study is submitted to the NCA CASI for their review and evaluation. In addition to the accreditation visits, annual reports are submitted to the NCA CASI, which serves as an update for the original self-study. The process of self-evaluation is continuous.
Extracurricular activities.
LEMS offers a various amount of clubs for students to join.
Student government.
The student government of LEMS is made up entirely of LEMS students grades 6-8 and one adult sponsor. In the student council (or STUCO), the entire 6-8 student body (the middle school) selects a STUCO president from the eighth grade class. They then select a vice president from either the seventh or eighth grade class. Each grade also selects one student from their own grade to represent their grade as a whole, who becomes that grade's senator. Each seminar then selects a representative from their class to act as their seminar class representative. Additional student representatives are the secretary and the parliamentarian. All of their offices are elected by use of secret ballots. Once one is elected, the elected person holds the office for the duration of the year except for special circumstances, such as an unexpected move or promotion. If one so wishes, one may run again the next year, as STUCO offices are open to all LEMS students grades 6-8.
The student council supports the students in such ways as organizing dances, spirit weeks, and other miscellaneous events during the school year.

Shawn Kelly

Shawn Kelly is an animator of movies and was a co-founder of the company Animation Mentor, an online animation school with student/mentor relationships at its core.
Life and career.
Born in Sonoma County, Calif., and raised in Petaluma, Kelly set his sights on working at Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) at age five when the movie Star Wars hit the big screen. Under the tutelage of animators Bill Hennes and John Root, he studied drawing and computer software throughout high school, attended community college, and Academy of Art University in San Francisco. 
A summer internship at ILM introduced Kelly to another influential mentor, animation director Wayne Gilbert. It was through Gilbert that Kelly realized that he wasn’t learning what he needed at school. Kelly left the academy in 1996 for a job as a character animator at former video game and educational company Presage Software, but continued his studies with Gilbert twice a week.
In 1998, Kelly fulfilled his lifelong dream and landed a job at ILM. Since that time, he has worked on numerous films including "War of the Worlds", for which he animated tripods and probes; ', where he helped develop and animate the vulture droids and animated Yoda in a pivotal swordfight; and "Rango", where he was the Lead Animator for both the Mayor of Dirt and the Spirit of the West. Kelly also worked as Lead Animator on all three Transformers movies. Kelly’s credits feature 23 films including "Hulk", the Star Wars prequels, ', and "The Avengers".
Because Kelly realized his dream to animate films with the help of three mentors who took a personal interest in his career, he became convinced that animation lovers everywhere should have the same opportunity, and he co-founded Animation Mentor, an online animation school with student/mentor relationships at its core. Kelly works with Bobby Beck, Animation Mentor’s CEO and President, and cofounder Carlos Baena to help define and shape the school’s overall direction. Kelly balances his Animation Mentor role with his work as a senior animator at Industrial Light & Magic.
Kelly lives in California with his wife Jen, and writes short films.

The True Story of Jesse James

The True Story of Jesse James is a 1957 American Western drama film adapted from Henry King's 1939 film "Jesse James", which was only loosely based on James' life. It was directed by Nicholas Ray, with Robert Wagner portraying Jesse James and Jeffrey Hunter starring as Frank James. Filming took place during 1955. Titled "The James Brothers" for release in the United Kingdom, the film focused on the relationship between the two James brothers during the last 18 years of Jesse James' life. 
Plot.
Jesse (Robert Wagner) and Frank James (Jeffrey Hunter) ride with their gang into Northfield, Minnesota for a raid. While robbing a bank, gun fighting breaks out and two of the gang are killed. The James brothers and another gang member head out of town and hide out while investigators from the Remington Detective Agency search for James to receive a $30,000 reward. While the three are hiding, the film tells the story of how the James brothers came to be criminals in flashback.
Production.
Shortly after his success with 1955's "Rebel Without a Cause", Ray was hired to direct this movie based on Jesse James' later life. He had only one movie left under his contract with 20th Century Fox, before he would depart for Europe and film "Bitter Victory". The studio suggested a remake of King's 1939 biography of Jesse James.
It is speculated that had James Dean not died in a car crash before production began, he would have starred in this film as Jesse James. In place of Dean, director Ray hoped to cast Elvis Presley, who had successfully completed his first film, "Love Me Tender". Ray's son Tony also was cast in the film as Bob Younger, the first time he appeared in one of his father's films.
Hope Lange, a contract player for 20th Century Fox, was hired for the role after her Academy Award-nominated success with "Peyton Place". John Carradine had appeared in the first Jesse James film as Bob Ford and appears in the 1957 version as Rev. Jethro Bailey.
Ray shot the film using CinemaScope, a new technology at that time. The movie was shot in 1956. Stock footage that had previously been used on the earlier James film which inspired this one was re-used and reconfigured for CinemaScope.
Characterizations.
In the film, James is portrayed as "Nicholas Ray hero"—a consistent type of character seen throughout Ray's films and thought to be based on Ray himself. Ray's similar characters include Jim Stark (James Dean) in "Rebel Without a Cause" and Jesus Christ in "King of Kings".

John Fitzpatrick (racing driver)

John Fitzpatrick (born 9 June 1943) is a former British racing driver, winning many titles throughout his career. He still works within motorsport as a consultant doing corporate events and driver management. He still participates in historic races.
Racing career.
He first entered the British Saloon Car Championship (now known as the British Touring Car Championship) in 1964 driving a works Mini Cooper, finishing the season in second place overall behind Jim Clark. In 1966 he won the Championship driving a Broadspeed Ford Anglia.
In 1971 Fitzpatrick won the Jarama 4 Hours in a works Ford Escort RS1600 along with many other races in both the UK and Europe.
In 1972 he won the 6 Hours of the Nürburgring for the renowned BMW Schnitzer team along with Rolf Stommelen. He won the European GT Championship and the coveted Porsche Cup in 1972 and 1974 driving for both Kremer and Georg Loos Teams.
In 1976 he won the Bathurst 1000 in an Australian Group C Holden Torana L34 touring car with Bob Morris driving for the Ron Hodgson Team. In a dramatic finish, Fitzpatrick nursed the Torana home trailing smoke over the last few laps. Initially thought to be an engine problem, it was later revealed that an oil seal had failed and the leaking oil was getting into the clutch making it slip badly and slowing him down, especially on the steeper parts of the Mount Panorama Circuit.
Fitzpatrick was a regular driver at Bathurst, first teaming with 1967 winner Fred Gibson in an Alfa Romeo 2000 GTV in 1975, winning with Morris in 1976 while again joining Morris in 1977 and 1978 in a Torana (both DNF). He teamed with four time winner Allan Moffat in 1979 in a Ford XC Falcon (DNF) and again in 1980 in an Ford XD Falcon (DNF). He returned to join forces with Bob Morris in 1981 (XD Falcon - 2nd). His last appearance as a driver in Australia was to have been the 1982 James Hardie 1000 but after Morris qualified their XE Falcon 6th, Fitzpatrick had a front wheel break going through Forrest Elbow during the Saturday afternoon practice session causing the car to crash heavily into the wall. The damage was enough to prevent the Seiko sponsored Falcon from starting Australia's Great Race.
He also won the Silverstone 1000 km in the Hermetite BMW driving with Tom Walkinshaw, a race which he again won in 1978 drving a Porsche 935 for the Georg Loos Team. His next title came in 1980 with a Porsche 935 K3 in the IMSA Championship and Porsche Cup. More titles came in the 1980s driving Porsches for his own team. These included the Los Angeles Times Grand Prix in 1980, '81 and '83 at Riverside International Raceway and in 1983 The Brands Hatch 1000 km with Derek Warwick and the Elkhart Lake Can-Am in his Porsche 956.
Fitzpatrick also started John Fitzpatrick Racing with success competing regularly in the World Sportscar Championship. Both as a driver and team owner, Fitzpatrick enjoyed success using the Porsche 956 with drivers such as Formula One drivers Thierry Boutsen, Roberto Moreno, Rupert Keegan, Guy Edwards, Philippe Streiff and racing journalist/commentator David Hobbs all driving JFR cars.
John Fitzpatrick sold his entire team, including racing cars, transporters and all equipment to Jochen Dauer at the end of 1986.
John Fitzpatrick intended to expand the team into CART for the 1984 season with JDavid sponsorship using March customer chassis but the project did not come to fruition.

Mokihinui Hydro

The Mokihunui Hydro was a proposed hydroelectric dam and power station planned for the conservation land in the Mokihinui River on the West Coast of New Zealand. The project, developed by Meridian Energy was expected to cost $300 million. In April 2010, resource consents to dam the Mokihinui River were granted to Meridian. 
In May 2010 the Department of Conservation lodged an appeal with the Environment Court. 
On 22 May 2012 Meridian Energy cancelled the project, withdrawing it from the Environment Court. The project was withdrawn due to high costs and environmental concerns and the project's risks and uncertainties.
Description.
The 85-megawatt power station was expected to generate up to 360 GWh a year, or 14 percent more than the annual electricity consumption of the entire West Coast region (317 GWh). It would also provide much needed electricity generation to the Upper South Island, as local generation is well short of local demand and most of the electricity has to be transmitted from the Waitaki Valley, over 600 km away.
Consultation.
In 2007, Meridian Energy Limited consulted affected parties about its proposal to place a hydro-electric dam on the Mohikinui River. The dam would have been located 3 km upstream from Seddonville, between it and the Mokihinui River Forks. Meridian Energy began investigating the proposal in 2006, following from similar studies conducted by the New Zealand Ministry of Works in the 1960s and 1970s. On 15 March 2008, the West Coast Regional Council called for public submissions on Meridian's applications for resource consents. Forest and Bird opposed the dam and accused Meridian of not making public a report from Landcare Research that advised that the hydro scheme would cause significant adverse environmental effects.
Recreational use after construction.
Meridian Energy stated that there would be recreational benefits with the lake formed by the proposed dam. Boat ramps would be provided for access onto the new lake. A local trust was planned that would have an access track, called the "Old Ghosts Road", pushed through to Lyell, following a historic gold miners route.
Opposition.
Opposition to the proposal had been expressed by a number of conservation, recreational, environmental and fishing organisations including:
The opposition was due to number of reasons: the river and the 330ha of forest that would be inundated has high intrinsic natural values, it is regarded as a scenic river, and it has valued recreational use for whitewater activities and tramping.
In April 2010, the Department of Conservation stated that it had lodged an appeal with the Environment Court of the decision to grant the resource consents to Meridian Energy.

The title of the book is taken from a passage in Chapter 13 on page 218 of the first printing of the hardcover edition. The sentence reads "I turned my head and saw, beyond the shoulder of my beloved, the empty copper sea, hushed and waiting, as if the world had paused between breaths."
Sam Elliott played McGee in the television movie of "The Empty Copper Sea", titled "Travis McGee" (1983). Inexplicably, the film eliminated the Florida locales so central to the McGee novels, making the adventurous crime-solver a resident of California instead.
Plot Summary.
A wealthy landowner/investor named Hub Lawless has disappeared off the west coast of Florida; supposedly fallen overboard during a storm and drowned. The captain of the boat, Van Harder, is blamed, having been found drunk and passed out when the boat returned to shore. But not is all as it appears and it's possible that the dead man faked his own death and is, instead, living in Mexico with a lover, avoiding the eventual failure of his businesses.
Harder comes to McGee, asking him to salvage his reputation as a boat captain. He has placed a value of $20,000 on his "good name" and has offered $10,000 to McGee in payments over time to find out the truth of what happened. 
McGee and Meyer travel to the Gulf Coast of Florida, undercover as investors, to find out the truth of what happened. Over the course of the investigation, McGee meets Gretel, who features prominently in the next book, "The Green Ripper".

Yunus-bek Yevkurov

Yunus-bek Bamatgireyevich Yevkurov (; born 23 July 1963) is the head of the southern Russian republic of Ingushetia, appointed by President Dmitry Medvedev on 30 October 2008. The following day, the People's Assembly of the Republic of Ingushetia, the republic's regional unicameral parliament voted in favor of Yevkurov's appointment, making him the third Head of Ingushetia.
He is a career soldier, paratrooper, and Hero of the Russian Federation who was involved in numerous conflicts where Russia played a key role, including Kosovo (1999) and Chechnya. On 22 June 2009, Yevkurov was seriously injured following a car-bomb attack on his motorcade in the city of Nazran. On 23 October 2011, Yevkurov was again a target of an attack whilst on a national holiday.
As head of Ingushetia, he has been able to stabilise the crime situation and bring about positive social changes within the Russian republic.
Early life.
Yevkurov, is an ethnic Ingush, was born on 23 July 1963 into a peasant family, of 12 children, consisting of five sisters and six brothers. He graduated from the same school that was later the scene of the Beslan massacre.
Personal life.
Yevkurov married Mareta on 23 December 2007. The couple have one son, born on 1 November 2008.
Military service.
Yevkurov was conscripted by the Soviet Army in 1982, serving in the Naval Infantry of the Pacific Fleet. In 1989, he graduated from the Ryazan School of Airborne Troops. Yevkurov continued his military education, graduating from the Frunze Military Academy in 1997 and from the General Staff Academy in 2004.
In June 1999, Yevkurov was stationed in the Bosnian town of Ugljevik with the Russian peacekeepers under the auspices of SFOR. On 12 June, he led a task force on a swift 500-km-long march, which aimed to secure the Pristina International Airport ahead of the NATO troops, thus ensuring a Russian presence in Kosovo after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. This led to a standoff with NATO troops.
Yevkurov has had various positions of command within the Russian Airborne Troops and has participated in counterterrorist operations in the North Caucasus. During the course of the Second Chechen War in 2000, he was in command of the 217th Guards Airborne Regiment (98th Guards Airborne Division). While on a reconnaissance mission, Yevkurov's team discovered a house where a group of captured Russian soldiers was held. Having neutralized the guards and infiltrated the building, the team was surrounded by Chechen reinforcements, resulting in armed combat. The Russian troops were able to break through the encirclement while Yevkurov was providing cover for the evacuation of the wounded. He personally carried a soldier to safety despite sustaining an injury himself. Twelve imprisoned soldiers were rescued. On 13 April 2000, Yevkurov, for his courage, was presented with the Hero of Russia award, the country's highest title of honor.
In 2004, Yevkurov was appointed to be the Intelligence Division Deputy Commander of the Volga-Urals Military District.
Political career.
On 30 October 2008, Yevkurov replaced the highly unpopular Murat Zyazikov as the head of Ingushetia. Zyazikov's dismissal and Yevkurov's appointment were received with much enthusiasm from the Ingush population.
Attack.
On 22 June 2009, Yevkurov was seriously injured following a car-bomb attack on his motorcade in the city of Nazran at roughly 08:20 local time (04:20 GMT). In the incident, a Toyota Camry filled with explosives rammed the Yevkurov's convoy in what is believed to be a suicide bomb attack. One escorting policeman died on the spot; Yevkurov's driver and cousin Ramzan died a few days later in a hospital. Yevkurov's brother Uvais was among the injured. Yevkurov suffered a ruptured liver, a severe concussion, and several cracked ribs, but was expected to survive following surgery. Yevkurov was then airlifted to a hospital in Moscow and was sent to intensive care with damage to his skull and internal organs, according to the "New York Times".
Though no group has yet claimed responsibility, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev accused Islamist militants of carrying out the attack, condemning the "terrorist attack". Speaking on Russian television, Medvedev claimed that Yevkurov "did a lot to restore order ... and the bandits obviously didn't like that kind of activity". Russian news agency RIAN, quoting an unnamed Kremlin source, reported that executive authority in Ingushetia has been temporarily transferred to the prime minister, Rashid Gaisanov, who became acting Head by Russian presidential decree. The source claimed that "President authorized Gaysanov to take operative management of the republic, and he has all the required authority for that". Gaisanov remained the acting head of Ingushetia until Yevkurov returned to office.
The attack followed other attacks on republic officials in June 2009. On 10 June, the deputy chief justice of the Ingushetian Supreme Court, Aza Gazgireeva, was gunned down in Nazran shortly after dropping her children off at school, and on 13 June the former deputy prime minister, Bashir Aushev, was shot dead outside his home.
After the attack, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov claimed the Kremlin had ordered him to fight insurgents in Ingushetia, and during his subsequent visit to Ingushetia on 24 June pledged to revenge ruthlessly. On 4 July, a convoy of Chechen troops sent by Kadyrov into Ingushetia in response to the suicide bombing was ambushed by militants. The attack caused nine Chechen deaths, with 10 others severely wounded.
On 9 July, Ingushetia's Interior Ministry announced the arrest of several suspects, including the Chechen rebel commander Rustaman Makhauri, allegedly involved in the attack on Yevkurov.
Yevkurov regained consciousness from a coma two weeks after the attack. Yevkurov was released from the hospital in Moscow on 12 August 2009, more than seven weeks after the attack, but continued to receive rehabilitation. Speaking to reports upon leaving the hospital, Yevkurov warned that "those who refuse to lay down their arms and surrender will be killed."
On 17 August 2009, in a radio interview after the 2009 Nazran bombing Yevkurov accused the United States, Great Britain and Israel of being behind the destabilization of the North Caucasus in order to "prevent Russia from reviving the former Soviet might".
By September, 2009, Yevkurov had returned to his position of head of the republic.
Resignation.
On July 2013, he announced his own resignation following the upcoming Elections to the Ingush Presidency.

Jacob Netsvetov

Saint Jacob Netsvetov, Enlightener of Alaska, was a native of the Aleutian Islands who became a priest of the Orthodox Church and continued the missionary work of St. Innocent among his and other Alaskan people. His feast day is celebrated on the day of his repose, July 26.
Early life.
Father Jacob was born in 1802 on Atka Island, part of the Aleutian Island chain in Alaska. His father, Yegor Vasil'evich Netsvetov, was Russian from Tobolsk, Russia, and his mother, Maria Alekscevna, was an Aleut from Atka Island. Jacob was the eldest of four children who survived infancy. The others were Osip (Joseph), Elena, and Antony. Although not well off, Yegor and Maria did all they could to provide for their children and prepare them to live their lives. Osip and Antony were able to study at the St. Petersburg Naval Academy and then were able to become a naval officer and ship builder, respectively. Elena married a respected clerk with the Russian-American Company. Jacob chose a life with the Church and enrolled in the Irkutsk Theological Seminary.
Missionary work.
On October 1, 1825, Jacob was tonsured a sub-deacon. He married Anna Simeonovna, a Russian woman perhaps of a Creole background as was he, and then in 1826 he graduated from the seminary with certificates in history and theology. With graduation he was ordained a deacon on October 31, 1826 and assigned to the Holy Trinity-St. Peter Church in Irkutsk. Two years later, Archbishop Michael ordained Jacob to the holy priesthood on March 4, 1828. Archbishop Michael had earlier ordained John Veniaminov (St. Innocent) to the priesthood. With his elevation to the priesthood, Father Jacob began to yearn to return to his native Alaska to preach the Word of God.
Upon departing, Archbishop Michael gave Father Jacob two antimensia, one for use in the new church that Father Jacob planned to build on Atka, and the other for use in Father Jacob's missionary travels. After a molieben, Father Jacob and his party set off for Alaska on May 1, 1828. The travelers included Father Jacob, Anna his wife, and his father Yegor who had been tonsured reader for the new Atka Church. This journey, which was always hard, took over year to complete, which was completed on June 15, 1829.
Father Jacob's new parish was a challenge. The Atka "parish" covered most of the islands and land surrounding the Bering Sea: Amchitka, Attu, Copper, Bering, and Kurile Islands. But, he was to meet the challenge as clothed in his priestly garments, he actively pursued his sacred ministry. To his parishioners, his love for God and them was evident in everything he did as he made his appearances while enduring the harsh weather, illness, hunger, and exhaustion. For him life was Christ. Being bi-lingual and bi-cultural, Father Jacob was uniquely able to care for the souls of his community.
Since St. Nicholas Church was not yet available, Father Jacob built a large tent in which to hold his services, and after the church was completed he took the tent with him on his missionary travels. By the end of 1829, six months after arriving at Akta Father Jacob had recorded 16 baptisms, 442 chrismations, 53 marriages, and eight funerals.
With the completion of the church on Atka, Father Jacob turned to education of the children, teaching them to read and write both Russian and Unangan Aleut. Initially the Russian-American Company helped support the school, but in 1841 the school was re-organized as a parish school. Many of his students would prove to be distinguished Aleut leaders. While living in the north areas was difficult, Father Jacob was active in the intellectual life as well; in addition to his own subsistence needs, he was active in collecting and preparing fish and marine animal specimens for the museums in Moscow and St. Petersburg. He corresponded with St Innocent on linguistics and translation matters. He worked on an adequate Unangan-Aleut alphabet and translations of the Holy Scriptures and other church publications. In addition to praises from St. Innocent he began to receive awards for his services. In time he was elevated to Archpriest and received the Order of St. Anna.
Father Jacob's life was not without its personal sufferings. 1836 and 1837 were to bring successively the death of his beloved wife Anna in March 1836, the destruction by fire of his home in July 1836, and the death of his father, Yegor, in 1837. After considering the message of these misfortunes, he petitioned his bishop to return to Irkutsk so that he could enter a monastic life. A year later he request was granted contingent on the arrival of his replacement. But none came. Soon Bishop Innocent arrived and invited Father Jacob to accompany him on a trip to Kamchatka. During the voyage Bishop Innocent seemed to have accomplished three things with Father Jacob: with the healing salve of the Holy Spirit provided words of comfort, dissuaded Father Jacob from entering a monastery, and revealed to the saintly priest the Savior's true plan for his life that was for him to preach Christ to those deep in the Alaskan interior. 
On December 30, 1844, St. Innocent appointed him head of the new Kvikhpak Mission to bring the light of Christ to the people along the Yukon River. With two young Creole assistants, Innokentii Shayashnikov and Konstantin Lukin, and his nephew Vasili Netsvetov, Father Jacob established his headquarters in the Yup'ik Eskimo village of Ikogmiute. From there, now known as Russian Mission, he traveled to the settlements for hundreds of miles along the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers, visiting the inhabitants of settlements along the way. For the next twenty years he learned new languages, met new people and cultures, invented another alphabet, and built more churches and communities. At the invitation of the native leaders he traveled as far as the Innoko River baptizing hundreds from many, and often formerly hostile, tribes. He continued even as his health deteriorated.
Yet the devil's presence came to stir up spurious and slanderous charges against him in 1863. To clear the air his Bishop Peter called him to Sitka where he was cleared of all the charges. As his health worsened he remained in Sitka serving at the Tlingit chapel until his death on July 26, 1864. He was 60 years old.
During his last missionary travels in the Kuskokwim/Yukon delta region he is remembered for baptizing 1,320 people and for distinguishing himself as the evangelizer of the Yup'k Eskimo and Athabascan peoples.

Tangible symbol systems

Tangible symbols are a type of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) that uses objects or pictures that share a perceptual relationship with the items they represent as symbols. A tangible symbol's relation to the item it represents is perceptually obvious and concrete - the visual or tactile properties of the symbol resemble the intended item. Tangible Symbols can easily be manipulated and are most strongly associated with the sense of touch.These symbols can be used by individuals who are not able to communicate using speech or other abstract symbol systems, such as sign language. However, for those who have the ability to communicate using speech, learning to use tangible symbols does not hinder further developing acquisition of natural speech and/or language development, and may even facilitate it.
Definition.
The term tangible symbols was first developed by Charity Rowland and Philip Schweigert, and refers to two-dimensional pictures or three-dimensional objects used as symbols to convey meaning. The items are termed "tangible" because they are concrete items that can be manipulated by the user and communication partner. Symbols can be used individually or combined with other symbols in order to create new messages. Tangible symbols are used as a means of communication for individuals who are unable to understand or communicate using abstract systems, such as speech or sign language.
Properties of tangible symbols include permanency, capacity to be manipulated by both the user and the communication partner, and an obvious relationship between the symbol and the referent. They can represent items, people, activities and/or events, and look or feel similar to what they refer to. For example, a cup can be used as three-dimensional tangible symbol to represent the action: "drink". A photograph of a cup can be used as a two-dimensional tangible symbol to also represent the action : "drink". Two- and three-dimensional symbols are used to fit the cognitive and sensory abilities of the individual, as well as the individual's unique experiences. 
Rowland and Schweigert use the term tangible symbols to refer to conceptually tangible items like two-dimensional pictures or three-dimensional objects. However, other authors, such as Beukelman and Mirenda, use the term to exclusively describe three-dimensional physical objects that display concrete properties such as shape or texture.
According to Rowland and Schweigert, "for some individuals, the use of tangible symbols may be used to bridge the gap between gestural communication and the use of formal language systems. For others, tangible symbols may represent an ultimate level of communicative competence."
History.
Historically, objects and pictures have frequently been used as communication devices. Many authors have also used picture symbols, such as line drawings and photographs to develop language in individuals with little or no speech and/or cognitive disabilities. Tangible symbols emerged from Van Dijk’s work in the 1960s using objects as symbols to develop language in deaf-blind children. In turn, Van Dijk’s work was based on the concept "symbol formation" developed by Werner and Kaplan (1963), who theorized that "symbol formation" referred to the process of developing language by creating symbols in our minds.
Types of tangible symbols.
Rowland and Schweigert propose that tangible symbols can be divided into hierarchical categories, ranging from most concrete to most abstract symbols: 
The type of tangible symbol used is chosen based on the cognitive and sensory abilities of the learner/user. The meaning behind each symbol is not universal, but by using a symbol the individual is familiar with, a meaningful symbol is created. Tangible symbols should be constructed by meaningful and motivating symbols that will provide the individual with the most opportunities to practice using the new system.
Users of tangible symbols.
Individuals who can benefit from using tangible symbols include those who may lack the skills to communicate using verbal speech or other various communication systems such as sign language. Users of tangible symbols may include individuals with cognitive disabilities (including developmental delay and intellectual disability), sensory and/or visual impairments (blindness and/or deafblindness), developmental disabilities (such as autism spectrum disorder), and orthopedic impairments. Rowland and Schweigert claim that tangible symbols do not require the use of high demands on the learner’s cognitive abilities, memory, visual perception, and motor abilities because they are:
Furthermore, simple behavioral responses can be used with tangible items. For example, learners that are unable to speak can simply point, touch, pick up, or look (in cases of severe motoric impairment) at the object to answer a question or make a request. Finally, three-dimensional objects can be distinguished from one another using touch, and therefore they are suitable for people with visual impairments or blindness.
A study by Rowland and Schweigert found individuals who were already able to communicate using gestures or vocalizations more readily learned to use tangible symbols than those who did not have intentional pre-symbolic communication skills.
Application of tangible symbols.
Presentation format depends on the users visual scanning and motoric ability. The tangible symbols can placed in front of the user within reach, placed on a board for visual scanning, or placed in a book for access.
Typically, tangible symbols are custom made and tailored to the individual child. If pre-made sets are used, it is assumed that the symbols are familiar and motivating for the user. It is important to utilize frequently occurring and highly motivating symbols in order to optimize opportunities for use.
Tangible symbol system offers a manual and DVD as well as an online course. For more information on tangible symbol system instructional strategies, please reference: http://designtolearn.com/products/tangible_symbol_systems
Universal tangible symbol system.
In 2009, Ellen Trief, Susan M. Bruce, Paul W. Cascella, and Sarah Ivy created a Universal Tangible Symbol System. They began by developing a survey to determine which tangible symbols were already in use, new activities and concepts for which tangible systems are needed, and participant preferences for tangible symbols from a pilot study. Participants included teachers and speech-language pathologists from four New York City schools. Following the survey, an advisory board consisting of directors of the New York City schools, speech-language pathologists, the designer and manufacturer of the symbols, a representative from the Perkins School for the Blind, college professors, and a graduate research assistant reviewed and discussed the results. This resulted in the establishment of the 55 universal tangible symbols seen in the chart below. However, this universal tangible symbol system should not replace a system already established for an individual.

John Kochurov

Saint John Kochurov (), hieromartyr of the Soviet revolution, was one of a number of young educated priests who came to the United States in the late 1890s as missionaries among the émigrés from Carpathian Ruthenia and Galicia. He was active in establishing parishes and aiding communities, mainly in the Midwest. After returning to Russia he was assigned to Estonia where he put into action the teaching skills he learned in America before he was assigned in 1916 to Tsarskoe Selo. Here he was martyred during the early days of the Bolshevik revolution. His feast day is celebrated on October 31. He is also commemorated on the feast of the New Martyrs and Confessors of Russia, celebrated on the Sunday nearest to January 25, which was the date of the martyrdom of Metropolitan Vladimir of Kiev, the first of the new martyrs.
Early years and America.
John Kochurov was born on July 13, 1871. His father was a priest. His education included attendance at the Ryazan Seminary before continuing at the St. Petersburg Theological Academy. He excelled at his studies at both the seminary and academy. After graduating in 1895, Fr. John married and then entered his life's work when he was ordained deacon. On August 27, 1895, he was ordained a priest at the St. Alexander Nevsky Lavra in St. Petersburg by Bishop Nicholas (Ziorov) of the Diocese of the Aleutians and Alaska.
Having expressed the desire to be a missionary priest in the United States, Fr. John was soon transferred and became the first permanent priest at St. Vladimir's Church in Chicago. This parish was later to become the Holy Trinity Cathedral. As St. Vladimir's parish did not yet have their own building, his first major project was construction of the church building. Under the guidance of Bishop Tikhon, later Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow and saint, Fr. John enlisted the services of the noted architect Louis Sullivan to design the church. To finance the project, Fr. John sought and obtained donations from Tsar Nicholas II as well as from a few Americans, notably Harold McCormick and Charles R. Crane who was the American ambassador to China. Construction of the church began in April 1902 and was completed the next year for the consecration by Bishop Tikhon.
Fr. John devoted much effort to aiding the establishment of other parishes in the Chicago area. He performed the first service for the future Archangel Michael Orthodox Church in southwest Chicago. In the greater Chicago area he was active in the formation of the parishes in Madison, Streator, and Joliet (all in Illinois), as well as aiding the parishes in Buffalo, NY, and Hartshorn, OK.
On the social side of parish life, he, with Fr. Alexis Toth, future Saint Alexis of Wilkes-Barre, was influential in the establishment of a major Orthodox mutual aid society that provided support for the many newly arrived immigrants. He also translated religious texts into English, looking to the time when the church in America would consist of English-speaking members. Before his return to Russia, Fr. John helped to organize the first All-American Council that was held in Mayfield, Pennsylvania, in 1907.
Russia and Martyrdom.
Fr, John returned to Russia in 1907 where he was assigned to Narva, Estonia. Here he put to use the skills he had learned in the United States teaching catechism in the schools. Then in 1916, he was transferred to St. Catherine's Cathedral in Tsarskoe Selo, just outside St. Petersburg. At St. Catherine's, he established himself as a popular priest who was skilled in presenting moving sermons. Then in October 1917 the Bolshevik uprising in St. Petersburg spilled over quickly into Tsarskoe Selo as the town was attacked by Bolshevik elements. The people thronged to the churches where the clergy held prayer services and led processions throughout the town praying for peace. 
On October 31, 1917 (Old Style), the Bolsheviks entered Tsarskoe Selo in force and arrested Fr. John. He was taken by the Bolsheviks out of town where he was summarily shot. By this act, Fr. John became the proto-hieromartyr of the Bolshevik revolution and the Soviet yoke. Fr. John was buried several days later in the crypt of St. Catherine's Cathedral. 
On December 1994, Fr. John was glorified by the Council of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church, in session at St. Daniel's Monastery, Moscow, Russia, as the first of the new martyrs of the 20th century. In the United States he is also honored as a missionary and inspired preacher.

Arsenius of Winnipeg

Arseny Winnipeg, known to be the most reverend archbishop (secular name Andrew Lvovich Chagovstov, ; 10 March 1866 - 4 October 1945) was a bishop of Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America.
He came to the United States as a monk in the early twentieth century and was instrumental in the founding of St Tikhon's Monastery in South Canaan, Pennsylvania. He was administrator of the Canadian parishes under Abp. Platon (Rozhdestvensky) before returning in 1910 to Russia where he stayed until after the Russian Civil War. In 1926, he was elected Bishop of Winnipeg. He retired to St. Tikhon's Monastery where he established the Pastoral School.
Life.
Andrew Lvovich Chagovstov was born on March 10, 1866, into the family of a village church reader in the Kharkov Eparchy. As a young boy he tended his father's sheep, but his intelligence and love for school did not go unnoticed. When his father died, leaving him as the eldest of five children, he was sent to a school for clergy children for eleven years. From there he was admitted to the Kharkov Theological Seminary from which he graduated with distinction in 1887. The same year he was ordained a deacon and then priest.
His years in the seminary and thereafter are only vaguely known. He apparently married while in the seminary and was assigned as a priest to a village church in Kharkov. There is a question as to whether he had a son, but soon his wife died, probably about 1890, of an unknown cause. At some point later he was tonsured a monk with the name Arseny, in honor of St. Arsenius of Konevits. But, his journey from his wife's death to his tonsure was a time of great anguish as he related in his elevation speech as Bishop of Winnipeg. In 1900, he was appointed Igumen (Abbot) of Kuriansk Monastery. Two years later he joined Bp. Tikhon in America as he was a natural preacher with fluency in many Russian dialects, and thus, well suited to the American missionary scene. He was active among those returning from the Unia and served many communities after his arrival, including Troy, New York, and Mayfield and Simpson, Pennsylvania.
While he was active among the people, a dream of his came true when with the blessing of the then Abp. Tikhon, Hieromonk Arseny founded the St. Tikhon's Monastery and orphanage in the rural countryside near Carbondale and Mayfield, Pennsylvania at South Canaan. The Wagner farm was purchased for $2580 during the summer of 1905. On the day of its dedication, July 31, 1905, a crowd on foot formed a pilgrimage walk of the ten miles through the mountains from Mayfield to the site of the new monastery. On the following May 30, 1906, at the dedication of the chapel at the partially finished monastery building with Abp. Tikhon present, Bp. Raphael spoke of the hard work by Fr. Igumen Arseny for the realization of the monastery. When Fr. Arseny was named the superior of the monastery, the crowd answered loudly, "He is worthy." The anniversary of this dedication has become an annual Memorial Day pilgrimage to the monastery.
Then, in 1908, Fr. Arseny was appointed by then Abp. Platon to the position of dean and administrator of the Canadian parishes. With his knowledge of the many dialects of the Carpatho-Russian/Galician area and his ability to preach in them, the Canadian faithful (who mainly hailed from those areas) almost immediately fell in love with him. With these rare missionary talents, he had great success with receiving back Uniats as well as welcoming many Galicians and Bukovinians who were arriving in numbers to Canada. His preaching produced for him the affectionate title "The Canadian Chrysostom." After only two years, however, he returned to Russia in 1910.
Little is known for certain of why he returned to Russia or his activities while there. In his request to the Synod, he wrote:
Upon his return to Russia, there are some reports are that he was involved in the training of missionary-priests and that he headed a monastery in the Crimea. After the October Revolution, he served with the White Army to comfort the soldiers. In 1920, he was able to get to Yugoslavia and entered a monastery. Some of his old Canadian flock learned that he was still alive and petitioned Metropolitan Platon to return him to Canada as a bishop.
Thus, the holy synod under Platon elected him Bishop of Winnipeg and requested his consecration, which took place on June 6, 1926, in Yugoslavia. Bishop Arseny traveled to New York to meet with the metropolitan, visit his beloved St Tikhon's Monastery, and then continue on to his new cathedral. It was, however, a different place from that which he left 16 years before. The seeds of violence from the Red revolution, Ukrainian nationalism, and the Living Church made his task difficult, even to the point of being injured by gun fire. In 1936, he was assigned briefly to Detroit and Cleveland before retiring to St Tikhon's Monastery where he was appointed archbishop.
Yet, in retirement he did not cease his service. In 1937, he applied to the holy synod of the Metropolia for blessing to establish a Pastoral School at the monastery in South Canaan. With the blessing of the synod, the approval of the Sixth All-American Sobor, and great effort on his part, Abp. Arseny opened on October 24, 1938, the first classes of the St Tikhon's Pastoral School, later to become St. Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary.
He continued actively visiting the local parishes and traveling for special occasions. Then at the age of 79, illness overcame him and Abp. Arseny died on October 4, 1945, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. His funeral and interment at St. Tikhon's Monastery took place on October 9, 1945, attended by many hierarchs, priests, and faithful.
Glorification inquiry.
During its October 2004 holy synod meeting, bishops of the OCA established a glorification commission to inquire into the possibility for adding Abp. Arseny to the calendar of saints. Abp. Arseny already enjoys veneration in the OCA's Archdiocese of Canada.

Free Fall in Crimson

Free Fall in Crimson (1981) is the nineteenth novel in the Travis McGee series by John D. MacDonald. In the plot McGee sets out to investigate the death of an ailing millionaire, and encounters a motorcycle gang, pornographic movie-makers, and balloonists. The book also revives the character of Lysa Dean from "The Quick Red Fox", an early novel in the series. In the finale, McGee's longtime friend Meyer is terrified into submission by the main villain and judges himself a failure because his inaction almost led to disaster. This moral dilemma is resolved in the next novel, "Cinnamon Skin".

THK-5

__NOTOC__
The THK-5 was a twin-engine aircraft developed in Turkey in 1945 as an air ambulance. It was a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane of wooden construction throughout. The main units of the tailwheel undercarriage retracted into the wing-mounted engine nacelles and the THK-5 could carry two stretcher cases plus a medical attendant. This was followed in production by a six-seat utility transport version designated THK-5A and three examples of an improved version of the 5A designated THK-10. A single example of the type was exported, sold to Denmark.
When THK was taken over by MKEK, this was one of the designs selected for further work. However, although the designation MKEK-5 was allocated, nothing further came of this.

Ahiagmiut

Ahiagmiut were a geographically defined Copper Inuit subgroup in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut. They were located near Ogden Bay, on the Queen Maud Gulf, and inland towards Back River, then on towards the Akilinik River.
According to Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson, Ahiagmiut abandoned their sleds in the summer and proceeded to the Back River with back packs and pack dogs.
Their hunting area was south of another subgroup, the Ekalluktogmiut, on the mainland.

Denson Seamount

Denson Seamount is a submarine volcano in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain, with an estimated age of 18 million years. It lies at the southern end of the chain near the Canada-United States border. It was one of the underground volcanic extrusions investigated by the 2004 Gulf of Alaska Seamount Expedition. The expedition's goal was:
"Our goal was to gain an understanding of the geologic histories of the five previously unexplored seamounts in the Gulf of Alaska. To achieve this we created a full-coverage swath bathymetry map of each seamount and its surroundings, and we collected rock samples at all possible depths." -"Randy Keller, Oregon State University"
On August 6, 2004, the DSV Alvin dropped down near the Denson Seamount and collected basaltic rock to try to determine the age of the seamount. The search was difficult because the salty water had altered the volcanic rock over time, but they determined in lab tests that the Denson Seamount was about 18 million years old. The team used bathymetric mapping to render three-dimensional images of the Denson Seamount and its counterparts.
