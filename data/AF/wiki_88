1970 Tonghai earthquake

The 1970 Tonghai earthquake occurred on 4 January 1970 in Tonghai County, Yunnan province, China. The rupture originated on the Red River fault, which had not experienced an earthquake above magnitude 7 since 1700. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7 and killed at least 15,000 people, making it one of the deadliest in its decade. The tremor caused between US$5 to $25 million in damage, felt over an area of . In Hanoi, North Vietnam, almost from the epicenter, victims left their homes as the rupture rumbled through the city.
Occurring during the height of the Cultural Revolution, it was not widely publicized by the Chinese government for well over a decade. The amount of aid and finances distributed was described by the Beijing Morning Post as "pathetically small". Much of the aid provided to survivors was in "spiritual" form, including Mao Zedong badges and condolence letters. Nevertheless, the earthquake was among the first to be studied over a long term by the Chinese government. It was cited as one of the reasons behind creating the largest earthquake monitoring system in China, 25 years later.
Background and tectonics.
Yunnan, the epicentral region, is one of the more seismically active Chinese provinces. The earliest earthquake recorded there was in the 9th century; however, moderate to strong ones have been observed since the 15th century. Since the 9th century, 32 earthquakes with a magnitude of 7 or greater have occurred in the province. Shallow strike-slip faulting is a characteristic of Yunnan quakes.
Earthquakes in southwestern Yunnan, such as the 1970 Tonghai event, are less frequent than in other parts of the province. The Red River fault, the fault line on which this quake is alleged to have occurred, has lacked seismological activity as a whole. Red River temblors generally rise at high angles, as shown in a 1962 Ministry of Geology report. Marking in sedimentary rocks indicate that several large earthquakes formed on the fault during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Until this quake, no earthquake above magnitude 7.0 on the Richter scale had occurred on this fault since about 1700, and the fault was believed to be "dead". Since the 1970 Tonghai rupture, it is believed that the Red River fault is instead experiencing a long seismic gap similar to that of the Japan Median Tectonic Line, on which no major temblor has formed since 700 but produced massive ones during the Holocene epoch.
Damage and casualties.
The epicenter of the quake was about southwest of Kunming and northwest of Gejiu; this area was mainly a tobacco-growing region. Effects of the rupture were felt over an area of . In Hanoi, North Vietnam, almost from the epicenter, victims left their homes as the rupture rumbled through the city.
The earthquake measured 7.7 on the Richter scale. It killed 15,621 people, making it the third deadliest in China during the 20th century, and injured an additional 26,783. The tremor caused between US$5 to $25 million in damage. A Reuters news report, the only one in the immediate aftermath, mentioned the recording of a "severe" quake by Hong Kong's Royal Observatory and cited an unconfirmed report that it might have destroyed part of Kunming. It caused of visible surface faulting on the Tonghai Fault. There was a maximum horizontal offset of 2.5 m (8 ft) and vertical offset of about 0.5 m (1.5 ft). As a result of inversion techniques, scientists were able to decide that several events comprised the surface faulting. This further confirmed that the earthquake, along with a later earthquake in Yunnan in 1973, corresponded to a fault within the area.
Aftermath.
Scientific study.
The earthquake was among the first to be studied over a long term by the Chinese government. More than 40 Chinese seismologists, engineers, and geologists visited the disaster zone to conduct research into the cause and damage of the earthquake; some spending as much as a year collecting soil samples and recording other primary research evidence for future study. Such data was collected over a broad area of almost 1400 towns within the area.
Reaction.
According to the Reuters report, the survivors came together to "fight against the disaster". Much of the aid provided to survivors was in "spiritual" form. The Chinese government sent tens of thousands "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" books and badges in his honor to victims as part of the relief effort, and survivors also received 14,350 sympathy letters. However, the amount of aid and finances distributed was described by the Beijing Morning Post 30 years later as "pathetically small."
The details of the earthquake were not widely publicized by Chinese authorities until about 18 years after its occurrence. In China's first decades of Communist rule, its policy was to not disclose natural disasters or accidents unless foreigners were injured. While the Chinese official press had not released a comprehensive report, Reuters and the Royal Hong Kong Observatory both released information soon after the disaster. At the time of the quake, the Xinhua News Agency briefly mentioned a smaller magnitude quake but did not provide information on damage or casualties.
On 19 November 1988, nearly nineteen years later, Chen Zhangli of the State Seismology Bureau, speaking at a news conference for another earthquake that had recently occurred, estimated the death toll of the 1970 quake to be 10,000. He did not give a reason why his government had not previously disclosed this knowledge. Government officials from China released a different estimate in 2000, putting the death toll at 15,621. China published the estimate after a memorial service for survivors and relatives was held in Yuxi on January 5. A Yuxi Seismology Bureau official noted that the information had been classified for "political reasons" and the death toll estimate had been known among bureaucrats as early as 1997.
Twenty-five years after the earthquake, the largest earthquake-monitoring network nationally was established in Yunnan. It set up earthquake offices in every county to prepare for another large rupture. The 1970 Tonghai earthquake was cited as one of the reasons behind creating the monitoring system.

Westfield Bradford

Westfield Bradford is the current name of a planned leisure and shopping complex in Bradford, England. In preparation for the project a number of buildings, mainly dating from the 1960s, were demolished on Forster Square and major shopping street Broadway.
By 2006 demolition work had freed for development a site encompassed by Hall Ings, Well Street, the new Lower Kirkgate and Charles Street.
In April 2010, after several years in which no construction had taken place, the project was mothballed and work began on creating a temporary park on part of the site.
The site was subsequently occupied by protesters unhappy about the lack of development. In January 2014, the park was demolished, and work resumed on the construction.
History.
In 1998 the Forster Square Development Partnership was established between Magellan Properties, Caddick Developments and the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council. They planned a 51,096 m² (550,000 sq ft) shopping centre containing Debenhams, BHS, C&A [http://www.flickr.com/photos/bradford_timeline/6161309021/in/set-72157627702593036], Marks and Spencer and 100 shops and other leisure facilities. (BHS already had a store in Broadway which was demolished as part of the demolition of the previous development on the site and C&A also had a store on the old Broadway although closed all of their UK stores in 2001 and thus cancelled plans to be part of this redevelopment). The partnership sold it to Stannifer which was bought out by the Westfield Group in December 2004.
Planning permission for the development was approved on 10 September 2003 with the claim that 3,000 new jobs could be created. Demolition on the Forster Square site started on 18 March 2004 and by mid-2006 the site was empty apart from a large pile of rubble. It was originally hoped that the complex would be open by late 2007 (with construction commencing in early 2006), but with a lack of anchor tenants and with many workmen still working on Westfield Derby, the start date for construction was pushed back. The delays led to Bradford Council threatening to take back control of the site from Westfield, if progress wasn't made.
Between 2010 and 2013, much of the site was turned into a temporary urban park. The urban park was demolished in January 2014 as work began on the shopping centre. The shopping centre is due to open in December 2015.
Expected stores.
On 7 February 2008 it was reported that BHS had cancelled its plans to open within this development, so that Bradford will not have a replacement for the BHS store which closed in 2004 as part of the demolition. Arcadia Group have signed up for stores, which include their Topshop, Topman, Evans, Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Wallis and Miss Selfridge brands. Some of these stores already exist on Darley Street, elsewhere in Bradford city centre.
Next has signed up for a 2 floor store within the centre. Its existing store in Forster Square will remain open. Marks and Spencer have also signed up - it is unknown whether the existing store on nearby Darley Street will remain. The jewellery chain Beaverbrooks was expected to take up tenancy.
In January 2014, Debenhams, Marks & Spencer, River Island and WH Smith were named as among the expected tenants.
Temporary urban park.
In February 2010, almost 6 years after the start of demolition, Bradford Council announced a plan to convert part of the construction site into a temporary park. The park would include new footpaths, seating, grassed areas, urban allotments and a performance area The funding for the park scheme was provided partly by central government, as part of a fund to help local councils invest after recession, Yorkshire Forward, and the developers Westfield. Work began on the park in April 2010. The park was a temporary measure; and was closed on 6 January 2014 as construction of the development was about to begin.

Peter Bishop

Peter Bishop is a fictional character of the Fox television series "Fringe". He is portrayed by Joshua Jackson.
Fictional character biography.
Peter Bishop was born in 1978, in the alternate universe, to parents Walter Bishop, also known as "Walternate", and his wife Elizabeth Bishop. In 1985, Peter acquired an extremely rare and savage genetic disease. His father, a brilliant scientist (in both universes), worked around-the-clock to save him.
Revealed in the episode "Peter", the Walter Bishop of the prime-universe watched his own son, the prime-universe version of Peter, die because of the same disease. He would frequently watch the other Peter living in the alternate universe via a "trans-dimensional window", which could allow someone to view the Other Side. Eventually, Walter formulated a compound and opened a doorway into the other universe, with the intentions of saving the other Peter from death. However, the vial containing the compound shattered on his way over to the Other Side, so he was forced to kidnap Peter, bring him over to the prime-universe, cure him, and then return him. But, after curing Peter on our side, he and his wife could not find themselves able to return him, so they raised him as their own.
Though at first resistant to this, Peter later grew up oblivious to Walter's deception, apparently forgetting it happened. He repeatedly told Olivia Dunham that he was never fond of his father, and even recalled times when Walter experimented on him. It is implied that Walter did this to see how Peter's body reacted to moving between universes. In 1991, Walter's lab assistant, Dr. Carla Warren, was killed in a fire in his lab, and Walter was locked away inside St. Claire's Mental Institution. Peter later admits to have never visited Walter, and continued to grow up despising his father. His hatred towards Walter grew to the point that Peter took books belonging to Robert Bishop, Walter's father, and sold them for money, an action that affected Walter greatly when he discovered this in 2009.
Even with his genius I.Q. level of 190, and fluency in English, Arabic, Farsi, Latin, Greek, Cantonese, Russian, and Spanish, Peter became a college drop-out with gambling debts, a jack-of-all-trades, and a master con artist. He falsified a chemistry degree from MIT and managed to publish a few papers before his con was discovered. The only time he spoke to Walter during his initial 17-year stay inside St. Claire's was when Walter phoned to tell him that Elizabeth had died in a car crash, though Peter later discovered that she actually committed suicide because of the guilt she carried from keeping him in this universe ("The Man From The Other Side"). Additionally, Peter has trouble with the mafia because he owes an undisclosed amount of money to "Big Eddie", a crime lord who had been hunting him for some time.
Season one.
Peter was first seen setting up a business deal in Baghdad, Iraq, when he was blackmailed by Olivia Dunham to gain access to his father. Peter releases Walter from St. Claire's so he can develop a cure for Olivia's lover, John Scott, though John is discovered to be a traitor (it is revealed in episode 1x13, "The Transformation", that John was actually an undercover agent working with the National Security Agency, and his love for Olivia was real).
For the majority of the early episodes, Peter despises working with his father, and in episode 1x04, "The Arrival", he prepares to leave Boston for good. But, he comes in contact with The Observer known as "September", who appears to read Peter's mind. Following this incident, Peter realizes that "The Pattern" does actually exist, and vows to remain in Boston until he discovers the truth, becoming a civilian consultant for U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in the area of fringe science.
By the culmination of season one, Peter and Walter appear to have completely reconciled. Peter even builds his father a device that could repair his water-damaged records, in episode 1x19, "The Road Not Taken". By the first season finale, "There's More Than One of Everything", Walter reveals to Peter the existence of the alternate universe, without telling him that is where he was born. Peter plays a key role in stopping David Robert Jones from opening a door to the Other Side, to kill William Bell, by closing the hole shut while Jones' body is only halfway through, slicing him in half. By this time, Walter begins leaving Peter notes explaining where he has run off to, making Peter remark to Astrid Farnsworth, "our little boy has grown up", solidifying his newfound love for his father.
Season two.
In the beginning of season two, "A New Day in the Old Town", Olivia returns to the prime-universe after a visit to William Bell in the other dimension. She was gravely wounded on her way back, and was not expected to survive. Before she was taken off life-support, Olivia awoke from her coma and cryptically told Peter, ""na eínai kalýtero ánthropo apó ton patéra sou (tou)"", Greek for "be a better human than your (his) father". Olivia did not remember saying this, or her experience on the Other Side, but this phrase appeared to affect Peter in some way. By episode 2x04, "Momentum Deferred", Olivia remembers meeting Bell in the other dimension, and learning of an impending war between both universes, and that an army of "shape-shifters" from the other side were working undercover in our world.
Peter and Walter's reconciliation reached its peak in episode 2x10, "Grey Matters". Thomas Jerome Newton, the leader of the shape-shifters, kidnapped Walter and forced him to reveal how he safely opened an inter-dimensional doorway in 1985. Peter risked everything to rescue Walter, and was horrified at the thought of seeing him die. In the episode "Jacksonville", Walter reactivates Olivia's Cortexiphan abilities, allowing her to identify objects from the Other Side because of a distinctive "glimmer" they displayed. When she looked at Peter, he projected a "glimmer", making Olivia realize he came from the Other Side, but she eventually promised Walter that she would not tell him the truth.
In the episode "The Man from the Other Side", Walter decided he had to let Peter know the truth, but, as he was about to explain, they were called in to investigate a case. They discover that Newton is attempting to bring something—or someone—from the other universe into our world. The sonic vibrations released from Newton's device would inevitably kill anyone from this universe. Peter, when attempting to foil Newton's plan, unexpectedly finds out that he is in fact, not from our universe. He is injured and while in the hospital, confronts Walter ("You said the effects of Newton's vibrations would be devastating. And they were, they...destroyed that FBI agent, they just...disintegrated him like he wasn't even there. But they didn't kill the man from the other side... and they didn't kill me. I'm not from here, am I?") and angrily blames Walter for his mother's (from our universe) suicide ("when I left, the guilt was too much for her to live with...the lie"). At the end of the episode, Olivia notifies Walter that Peter had checked out of the hospital and is now on the run to resume his isolated and nomadic pre-Fringe life. Despite attempts to track him down, Olivia is unable to locate him.
Peter travels to Washington state where he works with local police to solve a series of murders. Peter believes that Newton is responsible, but is proved wrong. However, Peter later finds Newton in his motel room, and Newton holds a gun to him. With Peter subdued, Newton calls out to "Mr. Secretary" (the man he pulled over from the Other Side) who comes from behind, revealing to be his real father, Walter (Walternate), from the other universe.
Peter agrees to accompany his real father to his home universe. He lies comatose for three days to acclimate to his old home and reunites with his real mother after waking up. Later, Peter reviews schematics of a machine (called the "Wave Sink" Device), which could heal his home universe, that requires his help for operation, but later learns from Olivia (who crossed over with Walter) that his real father intends to use the machine to destroy his adopted world. The Observers anticipated this outcome by warning Walter years ago that Peter should not return home. Additionally, September gives Olivia a drawing of a man, presumably Peter, in the machine and a closeup of Peter's face with energy emanating from his eyes. Olivia confesses her love for Peter, and they share a kiss. With this new information, Peter voluntarily returns to his adopted world with his adopted father and unknowingly with the parallel universe version of Olivia, while the Olivia from our side is held captive in the other world by Walternate.
Season three.
After returning to his universe, Peter finds it difficult being able to accept Walter's reasons for kidnapping him. In 3x02, "The Box", Peter helps thwart a terrorist attack on a Boston train station; he discovers that the ultrasonic device used for the attack is part of the weapon Walternate showed him, making him realize there are pieces of it in this universe as well.
Peter also becomes romantically interested in "Fauxlivia" (the alternate Olivia), unaware that she is an impostor sent to manipulate him and Walter. Later in Season 3 in the episode "Entrada", Peter discovers the truth as prime-Olivia informs him of being trapped in the alternate Universe. After the prime universe Olivia returns, she tells Peter that her hopes of reuniting with him helped her to survive and come back, leaving Peter in a tricky situation regarding his feelings for Olivia. "Fauxlivia" returns to her home universe and finds herself six weeks pregnant, Walternate finds this good news as he thinks it will be able to bring Peter back. Peter is yet to find out about this but he will then really have to choose between the two Olivias.
In the episode "Marionette", prime-Olivia struggles with the thought that the man she loved could not realize Fauxlivia was an impostor. She angrily declares that she does not want to be with Peter anymore, claiming "she's taken everything".
In the episode "6B" Peter and Olivia try to fix their relationship, but Olivia is scared because of how she sees him sometimes, "glowing" because he is from the parallel universe. She talks to him about it outside the bar opposite the apartment block but was interrupted by a soft spot glowing, because material from the parallel universe was being transferred. Olivia then talks to Peter and says she wants to know how 'beautiful' she and Peter are together, because Peter had previously said this, and then they end up together at the end of the episode.
In "The Firefly", September and The Observers resurface, hoping to correct a mistake he made 25 years prior. In the ensuing chase between them, Peter corners September on a rooftop and asks what will happen to him, if the "doomsday machine" will in fact destroy both him and this universe. However, September only cryptically states, "it must be difficult, being a father", before shooting him with his "air gun", knocking him unconscious. At the end of the episode, September and another Observer, December, watch the Bishop house, and reveal the reason why they orchestrated the day's events—to see if Walter is finally able to let Peter die, which he apparently is. "And, now we know", September remarks, "when the time comes, he will be willing to do it again".
In the episode "Bloodline" Peter's son is born to Fauxlivia, unknown to Peter.
Much of Peter's story arc throughout the third season revolves around the doomsday device. Peter and the science team discovered that our side had another weapon, with the pieces scattered all over the world, which was originally constructed by "The First People", the first human species on Earth. They realize that Fauxlivia's mission on our side was to locate the pieces of the machine, as Walternate's device on the other side was flawed and missing components. In "Reciprocity", the science team visits a Massive Dynamic bunker, where they have been constructing the machine. When Peter approaches it, the machine is triggered, and his nose begins to bleed. Following this, Peter decides to start killing all the remaining shapeshifters whose identities are on Fauxlivia's computer. When Walter finds out, he is worried the machine has begun to change Peter, "weaponizing" him. 
In "", Walternate activates the weapon on his side, using Peter and Fauxlivia's baby, Henry Dunham's, DNA. Through quantum entanglement, the weapon on this side is also actived, and, according to Sam Weiss, becomes "frustrated", after Peter attempts to enter it in an effort to prevent the destruction of this universe. Using Olivia's telekinetic powers, the weapon's protective force field is dropped, and Peter manipulates it, in 3x21, "The Last Sam Weiss". Whilst inside the machine, Peter's consciousness is propelled 15 years through time, arriving in 2026, outside the completed One World Trade Center. 
In "The Day We Died", the season three finale set in 2026, Peter, 47 years old and a leading member of a more militarized Fringe Division, is married to Olivia, who has taken Broyles' place as commanding officer. In this future, after Peter entered the machine, he destroyed the Other Side. However, both universes were inextricably linked, and by destroying one, it would only be a matter of time before the side remaining would also cease to exist. 
After seeing Olivia dead after Walternate (who had escaped to our side before his world's destruction) killed her, he becomes depressed and an alcoholic. Walter creates a plan to bring Peter's mind from 2011 into his 2026 body, where he would witness the end of days, before returning him, with the hopes that the younger Peter would make a different choice, than destroying the Other Side, thus creating the "First People" mythos.
After the Peter from 2011 experiences life in 2026, he returns to 2011, and uses the machine to create a "bridge" between both worlds, where both Walters, and both Olivias, can hopefully forget their differences to save the multiverse. However, before he can fully explain their mission, Peter mysteriously disappears, and both sides forget about him entirely, but remain dedicated to saving their worlds. A conversation between September and December reveals they forgot about Peter because he "never existed", as he "fulfilled his purpose".
Season Four.
Because of Peter's "erasure" from existence, a new timeline develops, which while very similar to the original one, contains slight differences. Just as happened in the original timeline, Walter was locked away in St. Claire's Mental Hospital for seventeen years, until Olivia Dunham had him released in order to help her partner and lover John Scott. However, without Peter there, they were unable to save John's life. The Fringe Division of the prime-universe is still formed after this, but the characters all have subtle personality differences. Also, other events which Peter only had a slight hand in are erased entirely, such as the prime-universe version of Lincoln Lee's first meeting with the Fringe Division.
Olivia lives with the constant feeling that something is missing from her life, and joined Fringe Division because she believed it would help her find answers. As a result of this, she has a much colder personality, and maintains an openly hostile relationship with double, Fauxlivia. She also managed to kill her father (whereas in the original timeline she only wounded him), and was adopted by Nina Sharp, who continues to be a maternal figure in her life.
Without Peter's presence, Walter has even less of a grip of reality, becoming agoraphobic, afraid to leave the lab, hypersensitive to germs that may or may not be there, and prone to destructive "episodes". In order to cope with this, he has Astrid examine crime scenes while wearing an ear-mounted microphone and video camera, while he watches. He also sets up a bed in the lab, with an FBI agent stationed outside whenever he sleeps. Olivia appears to have a calming effect on him, and their relationship is more gentle and crutch-like than in the original timeline.
In "Neither Here Nor There", September the Observer is instructed by his superior to erase all memories of Peter that still remain despite the timeline's change. While September constructs the necessary device, brief apparitions of Peter begin appearing to his former colleagues. However, they are so brief that most do not notice, with the exception of Walter, who becomes so terrified that he hides in his sensory deprivation tank. His colleagues do not believe him due to his fragile mental state. Once the device is constructed however, September decides not to activate it, and Walter sees a reflection of Peter in the screen of his television, causing him to panic. The "hallucinations" continue, and become auditory, which Peter pleading with Walter to help him. This pushes Walter to the brink, and Olivia finds him about to lobotomize himself as a result. It is at that point revealed that she has dreams of Peter, and the two agree to try and find him, though they don't know who he is or why he is appearing to them. 
The situation comes to a head when a strange force appears to Olivia several times. They first think that it's another Cortexiphan child, but at the end of the episode, it is revealed to be Peter. He resurfaces (quite literally) in Reiden Lake, and is taken to the hospital, where, much to the confusion of the Fringe Division, he asks for Olivia and Walter, and reveals knowledge that no citizen should know.
After revealing his knowledge of the technology the new breed of shapeshifters are using, he is brought into the Fringe Division under heavy supervision. His presence is emotionally painful to Walter, who reveals that, in this timeline, Peter died when the ice broke after they crossed over from the other universe. While he seems to believe Peter's claims, he doesn't consider himself worthy of having his son returned. Though he briefly expresses joy and wonder at seeing Peter, he quickly states that he doesn't deserve it, and that Peter was never Walter's son, leaving Peter frustrated and heartbroken. His presence also confuses Olivia, who treats him as a stranger. However, time paradoxes have begun to form, apparently as a consequence of his return. After fixing the time paradoxes, Peter concludes that this timeline is not "his", not the one he knows with the people he knows, and he wants to go to the machine again, certain that it will take him back to "his own" timeline. 
Lincoln Lee later asks him if he had a relationship in the original timeline with Olivia, as Lee wishes to pursue Olivia romantically, but does not want to insult Peter if he already has a relationship with her. Peter reassures him that "She's not (his) Olivia" and therefore he has no objection to Lee pursuing her. He even purchases Lee a new pair of glasses more stylish than his current one, in order to help him. 
After making numerous requests, he is continually denied access to the machine and becomes increasingly desperate to return home. He confronts Walter and demands his help, but Walter emphatically refuses, as the previous time he tried to save a version of Peter, his wife committed suicide, and he lost his career and sanity. Out of options, Peter concludes that his best hope is Walternate. However, he is denied access to the newly created "bridge", but Olivia and Lincoln offer to help him cross over using Walter's portal, which in the new timeline was recovered by Massive Dynamic after it sunk to the bottom of Reiden Lake after Walter originally crossed over. Olivia and Lincoln desire his help to gather intelligence on the alternate universe, especially regarding a new and dangerous form of human-shapeshifters, which they believe are under the direction of Walternate. Peter refuses, as he believes he is neutral in the conflict and helping them would make Walternate less likely to help him. 
After crossing over, Lincoln and Peter make a failed attempt to gain access to Walternate and are captured by the alternate Fringe Division. However, en route to being interrogated, their driver receives a mysterious call and kills his fellow officer and attempts to frame them for the crime and execute them. However, they are able to overpower and kill him, with Lee leading the pursuing Fringe Division of a chase as a diversion so Peter can escape. He visits his mother Elizabeth Bishop, and after convincing her of his identity, gains access to Walternate. 
Walternate reveals that he has been aware of Peter's reappearance in the timeline as he has been monitoring the intelligence feeds from the Prime Universe. Peter accuses him of creating the new shapeshifters and asks for his help in returning home. Walternate summons his lead scientist Brandon and asks him for confirmation that Walternate created them. Brandon denies it and Walternate unexpectedly shocks him unconscious with a special device, revealing him as a shapeshifter. He explains to Peter that he the shapeshifters have infiltrated his government, and that he has no reliable way of detecting them, as the device he used on Brandon is fatal to humans. He also reveals that he had nothing to do with the Fringe agent who attempted kill Peter and Lincoln. He asks for Peter's help in assuring the Prime Universe that he is not responsible for the new shapeshifters and asking for their help, as he believes that Peter's neutrality in the conflict makes him trustworthy. He promises Peter that he will help him return home in return for his help dealing with the threat. 
After Olivia begins having memories of Peter, he believes that he is psychically controlling her to become his Olivia, as she is susceptible to thoughts due to her Cortexiphan powers. He leaves her, saying it is for the best. However, after a meeting with September in which he learns that he is in his timeline after all, he joins her again and their relationship is rekindled.
Personality.
Peter has been described as a "sort of jack of all trades", and also as a "brilliant person" who possesses "a lot of his father's innate intelligence". He is often the first person to note how insane the proposed experiments sound and tries to find logical explanations often where there are none. When he is first introduced, Peter is callous and cold to Olivia, showing little concern for Agent Scott, but he grows to become more sympathetic as details of his unhappy and often traumatic childhood are revealed. He often maintains a sardonic, cynical demeanor, but has proven time and time again to have a heart of gold. In addition, he has become far more enthusiastic about the work Fringe Division does, and his thought process has realigned itself to suit that.
Relationships.
Prior to the pilot, Peter did not have a close relationship with his father, Walter. As a result, Peter grew up turning his back on science, the career field of his father. While the relationship has had many ups and downs, Peter has grown to trust and admire Walter, and consider him to be his father.
In the prime timeline, Peter was in love with Olivia, but was unaware that he fathered a child with Fauxlivia, whom she named Henry, in the alternate universe. Subsequently, at the end of season 3, when Peter is removed from the timeline as though he had never existed beyond childhood, Henry, too, ceases to exist. 
In the alternate timeline, Peter married Olivia and had a daughter, Henrietta (female version of “Henry”). After being taken by the observers when they invaded and reunited after 21 years, she was killed by Captain Windmark in "The Bullet That Saved the World".

Moross House

The Moross House is a house located at 1460 East Jefferson Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. It is the oldest surviving brick house in the city; it was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1971 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
History.
The Moross House was completed in 1848 by brickmaker Christopher Moross; it was one of two built by Moross on the site. The ownership changed hands several times until the Detroit Historical Commission purchased it in the 1920s. The house was completely restored in 1971 - 1973. Currently it is a private home.
Description.
The Moross House is a three-bay townhouse, built in a vernacular Federal style with Greek Revival details, including heavy stone lintels and sidelights and a transom surrounding the entrance. It stands two stories tall, built on a foundation of river limestone. The roof is parapeted with wood shingles, and a pair of chimneys bracket the roof.

First League of Armed Neutrality

The first League of Armed Neutrality was an alliance of European naval powers between 1780 and 1783 which was intended to protect neutral shipping against the Royal Navy's wartime policy of unlimited search of neutral shipping for French contraband.
Empress Catherine II of Russia began the first League with her declaration of Russian armed neutrality on 11 March (28 February, Old Style), 1780, during the War of American Independence. She endorsed the right of neutral countries to trade by sea with nationals of belligerent countries without hindrance, except in weapons and military supplies. Russia would not recognize blockades of whole coasts, but only of individual ports, and only if a belligerent's warship were actually present or nearby. The Russian navy dispatched three squadrons to the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and North Sea to enforce this decree.
Denmark-Norway and Sweden, accepting Russia's proposals for an alliance of neutrals, adopted the same policy towards shipping, and the three countries signed the agreement forming the League. They remained otherwise out of the war, but threatened joint retaliation for every ship of theirs searched by a belligerent. By the time the Treaty of Paris ended the war in 1783, Prussia, the Holy Roman Empire, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the Ottoman Empire had all become members.
As the Royal Navy outnumbered all their fleets combined, the alliance as a military measure was what Catherine later called it, an "armed nullity". Diplomatically, however, it carried greater weight; France and the United States of America were quick to proclaim their adherence to the new principle of free neutral commerce. Britain—which did not—still had no wish to antagonize Russia, and avoided interfering with the allies' shipping. While both sides of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War tacitly understood it as an attempt to keep the Netherlands out of the League, Britain did not officially regard the alliance as hostile. Throughout the war most of the naval supplies of the Royal Navy continued to come from the Baltic Sea.
It was followed in the Napoleonic Wars by the Second League of Armed Neutrality which was massively less successful and ended after the British victory at the Battle of Copenhagen.

Anti-flash gear

Anti-flash gear, also known simply as flash gear, is basic personal protective equipment consisting of a fire-resistant hood and fire-resistant gloves - often made of Nomex.
The purpose of anti-flash gear is to provide protection to the head, neck, face and hands from short-duration flame exposure and heat. This equipment is donned by all shipboard personnel whenever a fire breaks out or during periods of heightened readiness.
Anti-flash gear may be accompanied by other protective gear, such as life belts, helmets, gas masks, etc. While it may be worn by first-response fire-fighting parties, regular shipboard fire-fighters will usually wear full protective gear similar to civilian fire fighters.
History.
Anti-flash gear was introduced in the Royal Navy following the Battle of Jutland, when a number of British warships had been destroyed or damaged by flash from burning cordite propellant passing through the shell handling room into the magazine. It was found that the anti-flash hoods and gloves were more effective if flame-proofed with borax or boric acid.

Domestic policy of Evo Morales

The domestic policy of Evo Morales refers to the domestic policy initiatives of the current President of Bolivia, including past pre-presidential advocacies by Morales.
Politics.
Morales articulated the driving force behind MAS in the following terms:
He also stated:
Morales has argued for the establishment of a constituent assembly to transform the country. He also proposed the creation of a new hydrocarbon law to guarantee at least 50% of revenue to Bolivia, although MAS has also shown interest in complete nationalization of the gas and oil industries. Morales has taken a middle ground: supporting the nationalization of natural gas companies, but supporting foreign cooperation in the industry.
Morales has referred to the U.S.-driven Free Trade Area of the Americas as "an agreement to legalize the colonization of the Americas" and has supported the stated desire of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez to form an "Axis of Good" between Bolivia, Cuba, and Venezuela, in contrast to the "Axis of Evil" comprising the United States and its allies.
In March 2006, President Evo Morales announced in Santa Cruz an increase in the minimum wage by 50%. As it is currently set at 440 bolivianos(45 euros) per month, it would then increase to 660 bolivianos (67 euros) per month. Morales had earlier stated that it should be increased by 100%. However, 6 out of 10 workers are part of the informal economy, thus limiting the impact of this increase.
Fulfilling a campaign promise, Morales opened on August 6, 2006 an assembly to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority.
Education reform.
Indigenous languages in schools.
Morales supports a movement to teach indigenous languages such as Aymara, Quechua, and Guaraní which are spoken mainly in the rural areas of Bolivia. His government estimates that only 37% of the population speaks a native language that predates the introduction of Spanish in the 16th century. Morales's Education Ministry has declared the drive to increase this percentage as part of a broad effort "to decolonize the mindset and the Bolivian state." The program is seen as "emblematic of his government's indigenous-based social agenda". In 2006 Morales's Minister of Education and Culture, Felix Patzi, announced that he would be requiring all government employees to take indigenous language training. The Morales government's proposal to require all state schools to teach the languages has angered many urban Bolivians who see it as a move to replace Spanish. This is denied by the Morales government who point out that over half of Bolivians claim indigenous heritage and that it should not be shameful to speak an indigenous language outside of the home or local community. Patzi brought further controversy to the movement by calling Bolivians who can't speak an indigenous language "an embarrassment" and by issuing a letter stating that no school would be recognized unless they guaranteed indigenous language instruction in the 2007 academic year.
Reform of religious classes in state schools.
In June 2005, Minister Felix Patzi brought organizational opposition against the Morales governments' ideas when he declared that "Catholicism would no longer be ‘the official’ religion taught at schools." After mass protests led by the Catholic hierarchy this proposal was shelved by Morales.
Aftermath.
Morales, initially supportive of Patzi and his policies, faced with the opposition of the Catholic hierarchy dropped the proposal to change the religion classes in state schools. Morales also relaxed the language requirement, no longer requiring it to be obligatory in 2007. In late January 2007, Morales replaced several members of his cabinet, including Patzi whose suggestions had "got Morales in hot water with the Roman Catholic Church". The Bolivian media reported that this cabinet shuffle "reduced the number of ministers of indigenous descent, and incorporated more middle-class politicians from the radical left to his cabinet."
Economy.
Nationalization of natural gas industry.
In 2005, following popular protests and president Gonzalo Sánchez "Goni" de Lozada's resignation, Congress passed an energy law that added a 32% tax on production to an already-existing 18% royalty. It also required that companies renegotiate their contracts with the state.
As of May 1, 2006, President Morales signed a decree stating that all natural gas reserves were to be nationalized: "the state recovers ownership, possession and total and absolute control" of hydrocarbons (Bolivia has the second largest resources of natural gas in South America — 1.38 trillion cubic meters — after Venezuela). He thus put to some effect his electoral promises made during the various Gas Wars, declaring that "We are not a government of mere promises: We follow through on what we propose and what the people demand."
The announcement was timed to coincide with Worker's Day on May 1. Ordering the military and engineers of YPFB, the state firm, to occupy and secure energy installations, he gave foreign companies a six-month "transition period" to re-negotiate contracts, or face expulsion. Nevertheless, Morales stated that the nationalization would not take the form of expropriations or confiscations. Vice President Álvaro García said in La Paz's main plaza that the government's energy-related revenue will jump to $780 million in 2007, expanding nearly sixfold from 2002.
Among the 53 installations affected by the measure are those of Brazil's Petrobras, one of the largest foreign investors in Bolivia, which controls 14% of the country's gas reserves. Brazil's Energy Minister, Silas Rondeau, reacted by condemning the move as "unfriendly" and contrary to previous understandings between his country and Bolivia.
US Exxon Mobil Corporation, Petrobras, Spain's Repsol YPF, UK gas and oil producer BG Group Plc, and France's Total are the main gas companies present in the country. According to Reuters, "Bolivia's actions echo what Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, possibly Morales' biggest ally, did in the world's fifth-largest oil exporter with forced contract migrations and retroactive tax hikes — conditions that major oil companies largely agreed to accept." YPFB will pay foreign companies for their services, offering about 50% of the value of production, although the decree indicated that companies exploiting the country's two largest gas fields would get just 18%.
Nationalization of smelter.
On February 8, 2007, Morales announced that a metal processing plant outside of the city of Oruro owned by the Swiss mining company Glencore International AG would be nationalized. The plant processes tin, lead, and silver. Morales said that there had been "a lack of transparency in its financial dealings" and that corporations that abide by Bolivian law had nothing to fear. He said "Companies that respect Bolivian laws, that do not steal money from the Bolivian people, will be respected. But if the companies do not respect the laws, I have no other alternative than to recover those companies." Vinto was privatized by the Banzer government in 2000, when it was sold to London-based Allied Deals. However, Allied Deals promptly went bankrupt and was unable to meet its commitments, forcing the government to liquidate the asset. The liquidating entity Grant Thornton sold Vinto to Compañía Minera Colquiri, owned by Compañía Minera del Sur (51%) and Great Britain's Commonwealth Development Corporation (49%), in June 2002. Glencore purchased the plant from Comsur-CDC in 2004.
Coca.
Background.
Licit and illicit uses.
Coca is the raw material for cocaine but is prized by many Bolivians (especially among those of Amero-Indian descent) for its traditional uses in medicines and herbal teas. Long before coca was used to make cocaine, the indigenous people of the Andean region, the Aymara and Quechua, chewed coca leaves as a dietary supplement, a means to ease pangs of hunger and thirst and an antidote for altitude sickness. Many Amero-Indians continue to view the plant as sacred. In modern Bolivia, coca leaves may be legally consumed and are most often prepared in teas like "mate de coca". The legal sale and consumption of coca leaves are part of daily life for some groups of Bolivian peasants, especially those in mining and other fields of heavy labor. Noted celebrities who have consumed coca tea include the late Pope John Paul II and The Princess Royal. While a limited market exists for coca leaves, since the early 1990s the United States has put pressure on the Bolivian government to reduce the amount of coca leaves produced for refinement by the international drug trade.
Plan Dignidad.
In 1995 at the height of coca production, one out of every eight Bolivians made a living from coca. The country was the world's third largest grower of coca after Peru and Colombia. In 1997, 458 square kilometres of land were being used to produce coca leaves, with only 120 km² of that being grown for the licit market. In August 1997, with strong support of the US government, Bolivian President Hugo Banzer developed "Plan Dignidad" ("The Dignity Plan") to counter the "scourge" of drugs. The plan focused on eradication, interdiction (through lab destruction), efforts to counter money laundering, and implementation of social programs that countered and prevented drug addiction. The plan's heavy emphasis on plant eradication and noticeable lack of focus on trafficking organizations was noted by its critics at the time. The US Embassy in Bolivia defended the aggressive focus on crops, maintaining that Bolivia was devoid of significant trafficking organizations and claiming that the bulk of illegally exported coca went through small ‘mom-and-pop’ operations. This claim continues to be rejected by scholars of Bolivian society who say "Bolivia is very vulnerable to the influence of international trafficking organizations and that it is very likely that the participation of Bolivian entrepreneurs in the illegal business has increased." During the initial years of the operation area of coca production dropped. While in 1997 it had been 458 km², by 1998 it was down to 380 km²; in 1999 it fell to 218 km², and in 2000 it reached its lowest point at 146 km². Since the 1990s, the US has been funding the Bolivian government's eradication program by an average of $150 million a year.
Opposition to eradication, rise of Morales.
Critics of the aggressive focus on farmers and the program's lack of effort against traffickers argued against the claims that Bolivia's traffickers were only "mom-and-pop organizations". They pointed out the increase in prices offered to Peruvian coca farmers during 1998 as proof that international trafficking organizations were going to Peru to make up for the Bolivian shortfall caused by the program. They also pointed to the 1999 indictment for drug trafficking of Marino Diodato who was married to the niece of President Banzer, and was an Italian believed to have Mafia and Camorra ties. By 2001 coca planting in Bolivia moved outside of the traditional growing areas of Chapare and Yungas and the area in production began to climb ever since.
Along with an increase in world wide coca production, the program contributed to a decline in the real standard of living of Chapare peasants leading to protests and violent social unrest (where both demonstrators and police were slain). The Bolivian government's use of the military in coca-growing regions during the unrest brought criticism from NGOs such as Human Rights Watch. Promises of alternative development for farmers stagnated because of worsening external economic conditions. These conditions caused social mobilization among coca farmers like Evo Morales who called for an end to forced eradication and other measures enacted with the intent of countering narcotics. From 2000 forward, the Bolivian government made several agreements with coca grower federations to end confrontations, but they failed to follow through on their promises causing further opposition to these governments. Morales rose to national attention by leading the political opposition to eradication and this position is a central reason for his election to the Bolivian Congress. His association with anti-eradication forces caused his expulsion from Congress in 2002 which led to his Presidential campaign with its surprising showing that same year.
Morales coalition prevails.
Pressures from the Morales-led coalition caused president Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada to stop forced eradication. To address some of his opponents concerns in 2003 he initially proposed allowing families to cultivate small plots of coca but in the face of strong pressure from the US Embassy he withdrew the idea. Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada resigned the presidency due to the Bolivian Gas War. When his successor Carlos Mesa was unable to stem the increasing conflict over distribution of wealth from fossil fuel production he also resigned. Morales's support from coca farmers was seen as a large reason for his victory to the open presidential office in the 2005 election.
On his way to vote during the 2005 election Morales carried a coca plant. After it was declared that he was the front runner in the election he called for a referendum on how the plant should be controlled. Countering US fears that he would ignore coca cultivation expressly done for narcotic purposes Morales said, "There won't be the free cultivation of the coca leaf." He also called on America to enter into an agreement with Boliva to truly fight drug trafficking. He repeated his position calling for "zero cocaine production and zero drug trafficking, but not zero coca growing or zero cocaleros growers." He announced his government would study whether the amount of coca allowed for legal traditional consumption should be increased. At the time coca growing was legal on 29,000 acres (120 km²) of the Yungas valley with lesser area in the Chapare region.
Morales Presidency.
In early 2006, soon after taking office, Morales traveled to the tropical region of Chapare and met with a crowd of 20,000 consisting mainly "cocaleros". A garland of coca leaves was placed around his neck and more leaves placed upon a straw hat he donned to shield him from the sun. He told the crowd, "The fight for coca symbolizes our fight for freedom. Coca growers will continue to grow coca. There will never be zero coca."
There is much disagreement between Morales's administration and the United States regarding anti-drug laws and cooperation between the countries, but officials from both countries have expressed a common desire to work against drug trafficking, with Sean McCormack from the U.S. State Department reinforcing the support of Bolivian anti-drug policy, and Morales repeatingly calling for zero cocaine production and zero drug trafficking.
Processing plant.
In February 2007, Venezuela loaned Bolivia $250,000 to build two coca processing plants in Chapare and Las Yungas to turn coca into tea and "trimate" (a mixture of aniseed, chamomile and coca). The plants are set to be up and running in September or October 2007 and the products will likely be sold in Venezuela.
Constitutional Assembly.
One of Morales's electoral promises was to establish a Constitutional Assembly to re-write the Bolivian constitution. This was also one of the central demands of the Bolivian social and indigenous movements who supported Morales's candidature for the presidency. A Constitutional Assembly was established and elections for assembly members were held in July 2006. The Assembly then sat in Sucre, in the Teatro Gran Mariscal and was given 12 months to write a new Bolivian constitution. The process of drafting the constitution was initially stalled by debates over voting procedures (whether a simple majority or two-third majority should be required to make decisions) and then by the introduction of an arcane debate about which should be Bolivia's capital city, Sucre or La Paz. The draft Constitution was finally approved in December 2007, in a session which took place in Oruro. Although most of the members of the opposition party, PODEMOS, absented themselves from the session, the assembly was able to pass the draft constitution with the two-thirds majority required.
Constitutional referendum.
In mid-October 2008, a deal was reached to press ahead with a referendum on a new constitution after Morales acceded to demands not to run for more than one more term. The agreement was reached after Morales led a march of more than 100,000 of his supporters on the congress. He told the cheering crowd in La Paz: "Four political parties agreed to make the ratification of the constitution possible, the referendum to approve the constitutional draft will take place on January 25." It was decided that the referendum would take place on 25 January 2009.

Second League of Armed Neutrality

The Second League of Armed Neutrality or the League of the North was an alliance of the north European naval powers Denmark–Norway, Prussia, Sweden, and Russia. It occurred between 1800 and 1801 during the War of the Second Coalition and was initiated by Paul I of Russia. It was a revival of the First League of Armed Neutrality, which had been quite successful during the American War of Independence in isolating Britain and resisting attempts to interfere with their shipping, but the Second League was less successful than the First.
The Second League was intended to protect neutral shipping against the Royal Navy's wartime policy of unlimited search of neutral shipping for French contraband, in an attempt to cut off military supplies and other trade to the First French Republic. The British government, not yet anxious to preserve Russian goodwill, openly considered it a form of alliance with France and attacked Denmark, destroying parts of its fleet in the first Battle of Copenhagen and forcing it to withdraw from the League. In addition to this Prussia invaded Hanover in April 1801 as a way to attack the British. Paul's death in March 1801 and the accession of Alexander I led to a change of policy in Russia, and the alliance collapsed. Russia later joined the British in a coalition against Napoleonic France.
Legacy.
The prospect of a third league of armed neutrality potentially including Britain and France was briefly proposed in the 1860s, during the American Civil War, following the Trent Incident in which the US Navy stopped a British vessel and removed two Confederate diplomats. Ultimately the two countries did not form a league but did maintain the principle of the freedom of the seas, and both remained neutral.

History of Liao

History of Liao, or Liao Shi (; "Dynastic History of the Liao Dynasty") is a Chinese historical book compiled officially in the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) founded by the Mongols, under the direction of the great historian Tuotuo, and finalized in 1344. Based on Khitan's primary sources and other previous official Chinese records, it exposes the Khitan people, Khitan's tribal life and traditions, and Liao Dynasty's official history.
"History of Liao" of 1344 was compiled using older sources, mainly: 
The "Liao Shi" contains 116 volumes, including 30 volumes of Imperial Annals, 32 volumes of Records of Institutions, 8 volumes of Tables, 48 volumes of Biographies and Descriptions, and 1 volume of Glossary of National Language.
Many Chinese scholars of the time argued that the non-"han", "barbarian" Liao Dynasty did not merit its own official history, but rather posited that the Liao histories should be an addendum to the history of the Song, which was ethnically "han". This was part of the larger dispute between the Mongol court and the Chinese literati scholars, in which the Chinese political theory whereby only one dynasty could be deemed legitimate at a time clashed with the Mongol's beliefs to the contrary. Due to this dispute between two different political cultures, the "Liao Shi", as well as the histories of the concurrent Jin and Song dynasties, was not officially compiled until 1343-1344, when the pro-Chinese Chief Councillor Toγto () took up the pre-Yuan histories project again. In its final form, this project conceded to the Mongol court's desire to treat the Liao, Jin, and Song dynasties as equally legitimate dynasties. The compilation of the "Liao Shi" was finished in one year by imperial historians, although without undergoing any but the most minimal of proofreadings. Because of this, the "Liao Shi" and the other two pre-Yuan histories are known for their technical errors, lack of precision, inconsistencies in transcribing non-Chinese terms and names, and over-lapping subject matter. Scholars have noted the internal and external contractions in "Liao Shi" as early as the Qing period.
Nonetheless, the "Liao Shi" provides a large amount of knowledge on Khitan's imperium's tribal politics and traditions. Since the Yelü Yan's "Shilu" and the Chen Daren's "Liao Shi" are no longer available, Toqto'a's "Liao Shi" is the only known Chinese-style historical record of the history of the Khitan imperium.
The work of collation and punctuation have been done several times, by example in the Qianlong edition, the Nanjian edition, the Beijian edition, Baina edition and the Daoguang edition.The nowadays commonly use edition is the Zhonghua Shuju Press edited "Liao Shi", under direction of the Khitan studies' specialists Feng Jiasheng and Chen Shu, and based on the Baina edition. This Zhonghua Shuju Press version and its annotations also refer to other historical sources such as the Cefu Yuangui, Zizhi Tongjian, Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian, Jiu & Xin Tangshu, Jiu & Xin Wudai Shi, Song Shi, Jin Shi, Qidan Guozhi and Liao Wenhui.

Percy Egerton Herbert

Lieutenant-General Sir Percy Egerton Herbert KCB, PC (15 April 1822 – 7 October 1876), was a British Army officer and Conservative politician.
Background and education.
Herbert was born at Powis Castle, near Welshpool, the second son of Edward Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis, grandson of Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive. His mother was Edward's wife Lucy Graham, third daughter of James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose. He was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.
Military and political careers.
Herbert was made an ensign in the 43rd (Monmouthshire) light infantry in January 1840, serving with them in the war on the Xhosa (1851–53), the Orange River Boers expedition, and the battle of Berea. He rose to lieutenant on 7 September 1841, captain on 19 June 1846, major on 27 May and lieutenant-colonel on 28 May 1853.
Herbert entered politics when he was returned for Ludlow, uncontested, in February 1854, holding the seat until he resigned on September 1860. He continued to serve in the army, being appointed assistant quartermaster-general of Sir De Lacy Evans's division of the army of the East. He landed in the Crimea in this staff position, receiving major wounds at the Battle of the Alma and the siege of Sevastopol and also serving at the Battle of Inkerman. He took over from Sir Richard Airey as quartermaster-general of the whole British army force from when Airey returned to England until the evacuation of the Crimea. For his services in the Crimean War he was made an aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria, a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and a colonel (as a brevet rank, on 28 November 1854), and also received knighthoods from the Turkish, Sardinian and French governments.
On 19 February 1858 Herbert was made lieutenant-colonel of the 82nd (Prince of Wales's) foot, joining that regiment at Cawnpore on 21 April 1858. He commanded the regiment's left wing in the Rohilkhand campaign (being present at the capture of Bareilly and Shahjahanpur) and then the Cawnpore and Fatehpur districts until spring 1859, as well as being sent to pursue Firuz Shah and a body of rebels on the banks of the river Jumna in December 1858. In September 1860 he left Parliament to become deputy quartermaster-general at the Horse Guards. He re-entered Parliament in April 1865 as Conservative MP for South Shropshire, holding the seat until February 1874. From 1865 to 1867 assistant quartermaster-general at Aldershot. In March 1867 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Treasurer of the Household in Lord Derby Conservative administration, in which post he remained until December 1868, the last year under the premiership of Benjamin Disraeli. He was promoted to major-general in January 1868 and lieutenant-general in September 1875, and was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1869.
Marriage and issue.
Herbert married Lady Mary Caroline Louisa Petty-Fitzmaurice, daughter of William Petty-FitzMaurice, Earl of Kerry, on 4 October 1860. They had four children:
Herbert died at The Styche, Market Drayton, Shropshire, in October 1876, aged 54, and was buried at Moreton Say. Lady Herbert survived her husband by over 50 years and died in September 1927.

Wales & Edwards was a British manufacturer of milk floats based in Shrewsbury. They were particularly well known for their three wheelers. It was one of the oldest milk float manufacturers lasting from the early 1940s to the early 1990s. In 1989, the company was acquired by Smith Electric Vehicles. They sold mainly to United Dairies (later known as Unigate) and in the early years to Express Dairies. The basic design has evolved throughout W&Es existence before finally ending its days as the Rangemaster.

City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra

The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra (Czech: "Filharmonici města Prahy") is a classical orchestra, predominantly composed of Czech and Slovak classical and jazz musicians.
History.
The history of the orchestra goes back to the Film Symphony Orchestra (FISYO), which was found shortly after World War II, in 1947. After separating and fully privatized it initially performed under the name "Czech Symphony Orchestra", but had problems with unauthorized use of the name by other Czech ensembles for themselves. Finally music producer James Fitzpatrick came up with its current name in 1992, after the Velvet Revolution.
Under the leadership of German conductor Friedemann Riehle since 1995 the Orchestra quickly developed into one of the leading orchestras for CD-recording in Europe. The orchestra plays about 200 recording sessions every year. The Prague Philharmonic Orchestra works with labels such as Decca, EMI, Sony BMG and many international film studios. Soloists like Jonas Kaufmann and Sol Gabetta have recorded CDs with the orchestra. Also the orchestra recorded many international Movie Scores. Recordings have been made for film production companies such as Paramount, Sony, Lucasfilm and many others in the Smecky Music Studios. David Lynch returned again in 1997 to record his Lost Highway, and yet again in 2001 to record Mulholland Drive. 
Fully privatized after the Velvet Revolution, today, the musicians and supporting professionals continue to play and record music together (usually every day of the week) for major international films, television series, CDs/DVDs, video games, and even ring tones - both for the Czech Republic market and for clients & media productions around the world.
The New Years Concerts of the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Friedemann Riehle are a highlight of the Prague music scene. Also the Prague philharmonic orchestra has taken part in Marcos Witt's CD "Sinfonía del alma" in 2007.
In Dubai's New Year's Eve celebrations to mark the beginning of 2013, the Orchestra performed live in time to the city's fireworks display.

Robert Still (cricketer)

Robert Stuart Still (15 March 1822 – 5 July 1907) was an Australian cricketer, who played two first-class cricket games for Tasmania, and had the honour of captaining the team on one of those occasions.
Still was born in Bathurst, New South Wales. A tall round arm bowler who could generate movement off the pitch, he proved an effective opening bowler. In his first match against Victoria, he opened the bowling, taking 4/23 off 11 overs, and in the second innings, he combined with opening partner, Robert McDowall to skittle out the Victorians for a paltry 50 off 18 overs. Still claimed 3/24 off 9 overs, and MacDowall took 5/23 off 9. Between the two, they claimed 15 wickets to set up an 8 wickets victory for the Tasmanians. 
Still did not play another game for Tasmania until the 1857-58 season, when he was recalled to face the Victorians again. Tasmania were demolished for 33 on a damp green pitch, with Gideon Elliott taking an astonishing 9/2 off 19 overs. The Victorians replied with 115, Still claiming 3/21 off his 18 overs. Tasmania was again bundled out, this time for a slightly better 62, but it handed Victoria victory by an innings and 20 runs, with Still not required to bowl in a second innings, his first class career had ended.
Robert Still died in Launceston, Tasmania, aged 85 years.

Race for the Galaxy

Race for the Galaxy (also abbreviated "RftG" or simply "Race") is a card game designed by Thomas Lehmann that was released in 2007 by Rio Grande Games. Its theme is to build galactic civilizations via game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments. It accommodates 2-4 players by default although expansions allow for up to 6 players, as well as solo play. The game uses iconography in place of language in some places, with complex powers also having a text description. While appreciated by experienced players for being concise, some new players find the icons difficult to learn and decipher.
The game won "Boardgamegeek's" Golden Geek Award for best card game, Fairplay Magazine’s "À la carte" award for best card game of 2008, and was described by the magazine "Tric Trac" as ""LE jeu de cartes de cette année 2008"" (THE card game of the year 2008).
Gameplay.
The play style of the game is similar to that of another Rio Grande game, "San Juan", which is the card game version of the board game "Puerto Rico." Lehmann, "Race'"s designer, developed his own card game version of "Puerto Rico" at the request of the publisher. Some of its ideas were incorporated in "San Juan". Later, Lehmann used those ideas to create a different game, one of space exploration and conquest rather than colonial development in the Caribbean.
Each player builds an interstellar civilization that starts with only its home world in play and a hand of cards. Players strive to have the most victory points at game end; points are gained by settling new worlds, by developing new useful attributes for their civilization, and by consuming goods produced by their civilization's worlds. Each card serves multiple purposes: cards represent the worlds and civilization "developments", cards are used as payment for playing a world or development (by sacrificing cards from a player's hand); finally face-down cards are used as tokens to represent the goods that worlds produce.
At the start of each round, all players simultaneously and secretly choose one of five "phases": Explore, Develop, Settle, Consume, or Produce; phase selections are revealed simultaneously.
In the main part of the round, all players may perform a specific activity related to each of the phases that at least one player has chosen, in the order above (Explore, then Develop, then Settle, etc.). When performing the activity for a phase, a player who actually chose that phase gains a bonus (looking at extra cards during Explore, paying fewer cards to Develop, getting a bonus card after Settling, etc.). The Explore phase adds cards to a player's hand; the Develop and Settle actions let players play cards from their hand onto the table (a player's "tableau"); the Consume action can result in players drawing cards and taking victory point markers from a common pool; and the Produce phase creates goods that can be Consumed in a later round. Cards in one's tableau typically provide bonuses to various activities, in addition to providing victory points.
After all activities are complete, players discard down to a hand limit of 10 cards. Unusually among card games, cards discarded due to the hand limit or when paying a cost are placed face-down (in a "messy" pile to distinguish them from the draw deck), concealing information that could be used to deduce upcoming draws.
Play continues until, at the end of a round, either at least one player has 12 or more cards in their tableau, or the entire starting pool of victory point tokens has been claimed by the players. At that point, the player with the highest total of victory points from tokens and from cards in their tableau is the winner.
The principal difference in the playing sequence between "Race" and "Puerto Rico/San Juan" is that in the latter games, a given phase can only be chosen by one player each round, and the order of activities is based on player order and the phases each player picks in succession; in "Race", multiple players may choose the same phase, and the order of activity execution is fixed.
Expansions.
During playtesting, plans were made for two expansions to add more variety to gameplay, shore up certain strategies, and to accommodate more players. The game's success prompted the publisher to request a third expansion, as well as an entirely new series of expansions (not requiring the original trio).
Gathering Storm.
The first expansion adds components for a fifth player, additional cards, "goals" (opportunities to gain extra victory points chosen at random at game start), and rules and components for solo play (against a "robot" player).
Rebel vs Imperium.
The second expansion adds components for a sixth player, more cards, and (limited) direct interaction between players (in the form of military conquest (known as takeover) of certain worlds belonging to other players' civilizations; players who refrain from playing certain cards are immune to conquest). This expansion also introduces many new Rebel and Imperium Cards and introduces a special 2 player game variant where one player takes the role of The Imperium while the other struggles against it allying with the Rebels. In this variant the starting hands consist partly of Imperium/Rebel cards and takeovers are allowed.
The Brink of War.
The third expansion adds still more cards, and goals, as well as a new mechanic called galactic prestige. Each round the player(s) with the most prestige earn an additional victory point and possibly a card. Each prestige is worth one victory point at the end of the game, and many of the new cards allow prestige to be spent (for victory points, cards, or other effects). Additionally, a new "once-per-game" action is introduced that allows the user to search the deck for a card meeting a specific stated requirement, or to enhance the bonus the user earns in a round (at the cost of one prestige).
Alien Artifacts.
The fourth expansion will be used with only the base game, and as of November 2013, it is listed on Rio Grande's website with a release date of December 10, 2013. It will include new explore powers and an "alien orb" that players will be exploring for victory points and new powers.

Keith Robertson (writer)

Keith Carlton Robertson (1914-1991) was an American writer of children's books and murder mysteries. He was a former captain in the United States Navy.
Biography.
Keith Robertson was born on May 9, 1914 in Dows, Iowa. He joined the Navy in 1931, and served as a radioman on a destroyer. Later, he attended the United States Naval Academy, graduating with a B.S. degree. He attributed his initial decision to study at the Academy to a "fanatical aversion to washing dishes." He said, "When I discovered that midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy did "not" wash dishes but were gentlemen by act of Congress, I promptly applied for entrance." Robertson served in World War II as captain of a destroyer. He was awarded five battle stars. He retired from the service as a captain in the United States Naval Reserve. 
Robertson published his first book, "Ticktock and Jim", in 1948. His writing career spanned 40 years. As a member of the Rutgers University Council on Children's Literature, he was active in encouraging aspiring authors.
He was married to Elizabeth Woodburn Robertson, a rare-book dealer, and had four children. He died of cancer at his home in Hopewell, New Jersey on September 23, 1991, aged 77.
Writing career.
Keith Robertson is best known for the five books of the "Henry Reed" series, beginning in 1958 with "Henry Reed, Inc.", which won the William Allen White Children's Book Award in 1961. Another Henry Reed book, "Henry Reed's Baby-Sitting Service", also won this award, along with the Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Readers’ Choice Award, in 1969. The Henry Reed series was illustrated by Robert McCloskey.
Keith Robertson used the pseudonym Carlton Keith for his six murder mysteries.

<doc id="20094800" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20094800" title="Direct TPMS">
Direct TPMS

Direct TPMS, or direct tire pressure monitoring systems (direct sensor TPMS) refers to the use of a pressure sensor directly mounted on the wheels or tires of a vehicle. The pressure inside the tire is measured using a pressure transducer with the pressure information being subsequently sent to the vehicle to warn the driver of under or over inflation of a tire. The pressure information is commonly transmitted to the vehicle using radio frequency (RF) technology, though systems using mechanical, electrical or magnetic methods have been used over recent years.
Typical system.
In most current designs of direct TPMS, a small electronic assembly which is rugged enough to be mounted inside a tire, measures the pressure using a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) pressure sensor and then transmits this and other information to one or more vehicle receivers. Other information can include a serial number, temperature, acceleration and the status of the complete tire pressure monitoring system. The purpose of the serial number is to allow the vehicle to ignore transmissions from other vehicles and operate with a unique data field. A typical direct TPMS (e.g. Ford, BMW or Toyota) comprises the following components on a vehicle:
Most direct TPMS systems use ultra high frequency (UHF) radio in one of the 'unlicensed' ISM bands (industrial, scientific and medical) for transmitting the data, often around 434 MHz in Europe and 315 MHz in much of the rest of the world. On some systems there is a separate receiver or antenna near each wheel whilst more commonly there is a single receiver which receives data from all of the wheels on the vehicle. Commonly this receiver is also used for remote keyless entry system (RKE) as this also usually uses UHF radio transmissions.
TPM sensors can be fitted to the wheels in a number of ways. They can be mounted on the back of the tire valves stem or attached using adhesive or to a band which is then securely wrapped around the rim inside the tire, usually in the drop zone.
Direct tire pressure monitor system warning light.
When the direct TPMS warning light comes on, either one of the tires is under-inflated or there is a fault with the system. If the light is constant then inflating to the correct placard pressure should turn it off. If this is not the case then this indicates a puncture. If the light is intermittent or if it stays on after correct inflation or replacement of a punctured tire then this indicates a fault with the direct TPMS system.
Registration of direct TPMS IDs.
When the direct TPMS system is fitted at the factory the unique ID numbers of the TPM (tire pressure monitoring) sensors have to be registered along with their position on the vehicle with the tire pressure monitor ECU. This is also the case if any of the system components are subsequently changed e.g. in the event of rotating the tires, changing sensors, replacing the ECU etc. 
This process requires the activation of the direct TPMS sensor using low frequency (LF) radio and the capture of the UHF data transmitted. This data includes the direct TPMS ID, the pressure and the temperature. In automotive manufacturing plants, the activation is carried out using large antenna systems whilst in the dealerships and tire shops, hand tools are used. These tools can also be used to check the direct TPMS for faults prior to disassembly. If a TPM sensor or its position on the car are changed without re-registering the IDs, then the TPMS warning light will turn on and stay on until the IDs are re-registered.
Localisation.
If there are multiple antennas or receivers, this permits localisation of the TPM such that the vehicle can tell from which wheel the pressure data has come. As an alternative to this method, the vehicle can be programmed at the time of manufacture with the position of the tire together with its TPM serial number. This allows the vehicle to display which tire has low pressure.
Also, some vehicles have low frequency radio transmitters mounted near to each wheel which can be used to force the individual TPMs to transmit at will. These typically use similar technology to 125 kHz RFID tags where the transmitted field is predominantly magnetic and can be easily detected by a small LF antenna located in the TPM. This method of localisation is often referred to as a high line system.
The LF antenna is also often used by the TPM for configuration and to force transmission so that localisation can be re-learned by the vehicle if a sensor is changed or the wheels rotated to even up tread wear.
A third method uses the UHF signal strength which is proportional to the distance of the TPM from the receiver. If the receiver is located towards the front of the vehicle, the signal from the front wheel TPM's will be stronger than that from the wheels at the rear.
The TPM also has a method of detecting the rotational direction of each wheel to identify which side of the vehicle the TPM is located and this information forms part of the message transmitted to the vehicle. This combination allows the correct wheel to be identified.
TPM sensor features.
The TPM sensors currently fitted to high volume production cars worldwide are battery-powered, self-contained units which periodically measure tire pressure, and often temperature and acceleration. The sensor is equipped with an RF transmitter circuit which is used to broadcast the measured pressure etc. within the tire.
The TPM is designed to use as little power as possible to give maximum battery life. This is done by using very low power circuitry and transmitting the data as infrequently as possible and with as low power as possible. The UHF transmitter in a TPM typically transmits around 250μW (1μW is equal to one millionth (10−6) of a watt).
TPMs do not have UHF receivers built in due to the relatively high power requirements of this technology. This means that they can't tell that they are transmitting at the same time as another TPM. Most TPMs do have LF receivers as this uses little or no power.
The pressure, temperature and acceleration sensors generate analog signals which are converted to their digital equivalents using analog to digital converters. The acceleration sensor measures the centrifugal force generated when the wheel rotates. This force is proportional to the rotational speed. The acceleration sensor may be a simple switch rather than an analog transducer (accelerometer). This is usually referred to as a roll switch. The acceleration sensor allows the TPM to be placed in a low-power communication device mode, when the vehicle is stationary which can extend the battery life. The advantage of a roll switch over an accelerometer is that the switch is purely mechanical and doesn't use any power to take a measurement.
When the vehicle is stationary, the TPM may periodically transmit to the vehicle. This allows (as long as the vehicle receiver is always on) the driver or vehicle operator to be warned of low pressure as soon as the Ignition system is switched on rather than having to wait until the vehicle is moving.
All TPM units on a vehicle operate on the same RF channel frequency and each message includes pressure data, temperature data, a unique ID code, operating state data, status information and check digits. The check digit is either a checksum or a cyclic redundancy check (CRC).
The TPM does not usually have information about the tire's correct pressure as this would be very difficult and possibly dangerous to support. However it may have an algorithm contained within it which detects both slow and rapid changes in pressure. This condition may be transmitted as part of the TPM's status. It may also cause the TPM to transmit more frequently.
Direct tire pressure monitoring systems.
There are two main types of direct tire pressure monitoring system currently in use. These are known as 'high line' and 'low line'.
High line system.
If the vehicle is fitted with low frequency (LF) transmitters near each wheel, the vehicle may use these to force the sensors to transmit. In this case, the TPM may not transmit on its own, but the vehicle will periodically command the sensors to send their information.
In addition, the TPMs will be forced to transmit when the ignition is switched on. This will give an early indication of low pressure without having to have the vehicle's receiver switched on when the vehicle is not in use. The transmitters are usually activated one at a time in sequence so that the vehicle can inform the driver of the location of the wheel with low pressure. This information can then be used later for localisation by matching the TPM's unique ID with its position discovered by this sequential activation. This method is used on some high line systems where the TPM also transmits periodically.
On some vehicles only three LF transmitters are used in order to save money. The vehicle assumes that transmissions from a nearby TPM which has not been woken up by the LF belong to the TPM located where there is no LF transmitter.
High line systems are inherently more expensive than low line systems but they have the advantage of the vehicle knowing the pressure when started without draining the vehicle's main battery and providing localisation. These systems tend to be used on higher end models.
Low line system.
In this system, the TPM units transmit on their own at fixed or random intervals. As the individual TPMs on the vehicle do not know if another TPM is transmitting at the same time, it is possible to have collisions between messages transmitted. Measures have to be taken to ensure that the message is received by the vehicle. On some systems the message is re-transmitted multiple times to reduce the effect of interference (communication). The transmission pattern can be random or pseudo random to reduce the chance of collisions between transmissions from the sensors on the vehicle.
Another method of attempting to avoid collisions is simply to transmit more frequently such as once per minute. In addition, if the TPM detects a rapid change in pressure or too high a temperature, it will start to transmit more frequently so that the vehicle has more chance of receiving the information. The low line system is used on the majority of vehicles due to its lower cost.
Legal status.
USA.
The use of direct TPM in vehicles in the USA was mandated in 2000 by the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act (or TREAD). This states that the driver of a vehicle must be warned of under inflation by 25%. The warning is displayed to the driver in line with 49 CFR Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The minimum requirement for the warning is in the form of a simple lit symbol on the dashboard, and this is often augmented by the display of a graphic of the car showing the wheel position to which the warning light corresponds. All new model year 2008 light vehicles shall have a TPMS (direct or indirect) fitted which is capable of detecting when one or more of the vehicle's tires, up to all four tires, is 25% or more below the manufacturer's recommended inflation pressure (placard pressure) or a minimum activation pressure specified in the standard, whichever is higher.
EU and Far East.
European Union (EU) and Far East legislators are looking at TPMS as a way of reducing CO2 emissions, and are presently (as at January 2009) considering compulsory tire pressure monitoring systems from this environmental stance. Starting in November 2012, all new models of passenger cars must be equipped, in E.U., with a TPMS.

1. FC Haßfurt

The 1. FC Haßfurt is a German association football club from the city of Haßfurt, Bavaria.
History.
The club was formed in 1917 under its current name, 1. FC Haßfurt.
The 1. FC Haßfurt first appeared above the local football level in 1957, when it archived promotion to the Amateurliga Bayern-Nord (III), the northern division of the highest state league. It could not manage to hold this level in its first season 1957–58 and was relegated straight back to the 2nd Amateurliga Unterfranken.
Bouncing straight back in 1959, Haßfurt had a much better second try in the Amateurliga, coming sixth in 1959–60. A strong performance the season after saw the club winning its league and earning promotion to the 2nd Oberliga Süd, then the second tier of league football in Southern Germany. While the club easily won its promotion round, unbeaten in six games versus Offenburger FV, TSV Heusenstamm and Salamander Kornwestheim, it could only obtain a licence for the second division on appeal.
In the same league with some well-known football clubs from the south of Germany, like Hessen Kassel, FSV Frankfurt and Stuttgarter Kickers, the team performed well, earning a tenth place in its first season. Its second year in the league was to be the last edition of the competition due to the formation of the Fußball-Bundesliga. A fourteenth place was not enough for the 1. FC Haßfurt to earn a place in the new tier two "Regionalliga Süd" and it had to return to the now single-division Amateurliga Bayern.
Upon return to the third tier, the club continued to perform well, earning a third place in its first year. After a some mixed results, the team repeated this performance in 1968–69. From there, however, the club went downhill, resulting in relegation from the Amateurliga to the Landesliga Bayern-Nord (IV) in 1972. After three unimpressive seasons in this league, Haßfurt took out the title in 1975–76 and returned to the third division.
Settling in its first season, the second, 1977–78, proved to be a highlight in the clubs history. Winning the division, one point ahead of MTV Ingolstadt, the 1. FC Haßfurt was directly promoted to the "2nd Bundesliga Süd". Financial reasons however forced the club to not accept this offer and Ingolstadt found itself promoted instead. The club had one more outstanding season after this, in 1979–80, when it finished second in the league to FC Augsburg. The season after, it slipped to seventeenth place, and was relegated from what was now the Amateur-Oberliga Bayern. 
The 1. FC Haßfurt didn't manage to return to its successful past after this, fluctuating between the Landesliga Bayern-Nord and the league below, the Bezirksliga Unterfranken and later the Bezirksoberliga Unterfranken. The club found itself relegated from the Landesliga five times in the next two decades, in 1985, 1989, 1993, 1999 and 2005, only to return each time.
Having returned to the Landesliga in 2007, the club played in this league until 2009, when a 17th place finish meant another relegation. The club continued its descend through the leagues, playing in the tier-eight Bezirksliga in 2011–12, where it suffered another relegation, now to the Kreisliga Schweinfurt.

Christian Louis de Massy

Christian Louis de Massy (born 17 January 1949 in Monaco) is the son of Princess Antoinette of Monaco, Baroness de Massy, and her husband, Alexandre-Athenase Noghès.
Massy is a first cousin of the reigning Prince Albert II and nephew of Prince Rainier III. Although he was born out of wedlock, his parents married in 1951, thus legitimizing him. He was the second of three siblings. His two sisters are Elisabeth-Anne (born 1947) and Christine Alix (1951–1989).
Princely status.
By the time Christian's parents' married in 1951, Rainier III was the Prince of Monaco but was unmarried and had no children. Christian states in his biography, that his mother, at this time, was scheming to stage a "coup d'état" and place him upon the throne. However, once Rainier married Grace Kelly and had children, the possibility of Christian acceding to the throne became remote.
Christian is often referred to as "Baron de Massy", even during the lifetime of his mother, the original grantee of the title and, since then, without indication that the title was granted hereditarily.
Adjustment to constitution.
In 2002 the constitution was adjusted to allow siblings of the reigning Prince and their descendants to succeed to the throne, and Christian was officially included as 11th in line of succession to the Monegasque throne. When Albert succeeded on the death of Rainier, Antoinette was no longer the sibling of the reigning Prince, so she and her children lost their official place in the line of succession, but they and their descendants remain eligible for selection by the Crown Council if the current line fails.
Education.
Christian Louis was a pupil at the Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland. He was expelled. From September 1963 until July 1967 he was resident (during terms) at Downside School, Somerset, UK. He attended Cambridge University for a short time, but dropped out.
Marriages and issue.
Christian Louis has been married four times.
First.
To María Marta Quintana y del Carril in Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, on 14 November 1970. This marriage ended by process of divorce in 1978 - one daughter:
María Marta Quintana y del Carril (b. London, 17 June 1951) is the daughter of Enrique Quintana y Achával and his wife Marta Juana del Carril y Aldao.
Second.
To Anne Michelle Lütken in Ramatuelle on 11 September 1982. This marriage ended by process of divorce in 1987 - without issue.
Anne Michelle Lütken (b. 28 November 1959 - d. London, 25 November 2001) was the first child of Carl Fredrik Lütken and his first wife Bjørg, née Christiansen.
Third.
To Julia Lakschin in Geneva in April 1992. This marriage ended by process of divorce in 1995 - without issue.
Julia Lakschin (b. 6 November 1968) is the daughter of Roman Lakschin and his wife Ludmila. Roman Lakschin is the Dominican Ambassador to the United Nations and to the World Trade Organization.
She is married to Ivan Mikhailovich Musatov and has issue.
Fourth.
To Cécile Gelabale (b. Guadeloupe, 1968), as a baroness the highest ranked black person in Monaco. Two sons:
Cécile Gelabale is the daughter of Denis Gelabale and his wife Lucie Darius Denon.

Christian Social Movement in Ukraine

The Christian Social Movement in Ukraine was a political movement that existed in Western Ukraine from the end of the 19th century until the 1930s.
Ideals.
Its programme was based on Christian ethics and on papal encyclicals focused on social concerns whilst its political orientation was clerical-conservative. The movement's leaders included the Ukrainian political and cultural figure Oleksander Barvinsky, Anatole Vakhnianyn, and Kyryl Studynsky. The Christian Social Movement's support was based on Ukrainian moderates seeking rapproachment between Ukrainians and Poles. Originally its principles included loyalty to Austria–Hungary and the Habsburg monarchy, the creation of a separate Ukrainian province, support for the Ukrainian language and expansion of Ukrainian schools, and opposition to Galician Russophiles.
History.
Its political party, founded in 1896, was originally named the Catholic Ruthenian People's Union. During this time, it was supported by Metropolitan Sembratovich, head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and by the Austrian government, which subsidized the newspaper "Ruslan". In 1911 the Catholic Ruthenian People's Union, under the leadership of Oleksander Barvinky, renamed itself as the Christian Social Party and sent representatives to the Austrian Parliament in Vienna as well as to the local Galician Diet. After Austria-Hungary's collapse, the Christian Social Party subsequently participated in the formation of the West Ukrainian National Republic. Following the Polish–Ukrainian War, after western Ukraine had passed under the control of the Second Polish Republic, the party continued to function until the 1930s. At that time, part of its members joined the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance (UNDO) (a moderate political organization opposed to the radical Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists), while others founded the Ukrainian Catholic People's Party. The latter party advocated autonomy for western Ukraine but was loyal to the Polish state. It was able to place a member in the Polish parliament and Senate but was generally not very influential within Ukrainian society. 
In the Second World War, western Ukraine was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Christian Social Movement ceased to exist there.
Due to its strong ties to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the Christian Social Movement was criticized for its Clericalism by both left-wing socialist groups as well as by right-wing nationalist groups in western Ukraine.

History of Bombay in independent India

Mumbai (formerly Bombay) is the financial capital of India and one of the most populous cities in the world. Bombay grew into a leading commercial center of British India during the 19th century on the basis of textile mills and overseas trade. After independence from British rule, the desire to domesticate cosmopolitan Bombay within a Marathi social and linguistic framework was strongly expressed in the 1950s. Bombay, one of the earliest cities in India to be industrialized, emerged as the centre of strong organized labour movement in India, which inspired labour movements across India.
Background.
The seven islands that came to constitute Bombay were home to communities of the Kolis. For centuries, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese and subsequently to the British East India Company. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the British with large-scale civil engineering projects, and emerged as a significant trading town.
Bombay grew into a leading commercial center of British India during the 19th century on the basis of textile mills and overseas trade. The city was, first and foremost, built and developed by an indigenous industrial and commercial bourgeoisie consisting of Parsis, Gujarati Hindus, Muslims communities earning their wealth on the extensive Arabian trade. The expanding labour force in Bombay was initially drawn from the coastal belt of Konkan, south of the city. After the famine in the Deccan during 1876–78, large numbers of Maratha-Kunbis and other peasant castes from the Deccan arrived in the city. Until the 1940s, Marathi speakers from these areas accounted for nearly half of the city's population, and held mostly manual and unskilled jobs. The business community was dominated by Parsi, Marwari, Muslim, and Gujarati merchants and industrialists, who owned most of the capital, and dominated the public and political life of Bombay in the 19th and first half of the 20th century.
Bombay State.
After India's independence from British rule on 15 August 1947, the territory of Bombay Presidency retained by India after the partition was restructured into Bombay State. The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into Bombay State. Subsequently, Bombay City, the capital of erstwhile Bombay Presidency, became the capital of Bombay State. Following communal riots between Hindus and Muslims in the Sindh province of the newly created Pakistan from Bombay Presidency, over 100,000 Sindhi Hindu refugees from Pakistan were relocated in the military camps five kilometres from Kalyan in the Bombay metropolitan region. It was converted into a township in 1949, and named Ulhasnagar by the then Governor-General of India, C. Rajagopalachari.
In 1947, Congress party activists established the Rashtriya Mazdoor Mill Sangh (RMMS), with a claimed membership of 32,000, to ensure a strong political base in the textile industry. The RMMS served as a lasting impediment to the free development of independent unionism in Bombay. Economic growth in India was relatively strong during much of the 1950s, and employment growth in Bombay was particularly good, as the city's manufacturing sector diversified. The Bombay textile industry until the 1950s was largely homogeneous, dominated by a relatively small number of large industrial mills. From the late 1950s, policies were introduced to curb the expansion of mills and to encourage increased production from the handloom and powerloom sectors, because of their employment generating capacities. Bombay was one of the few industrial centres of India where strong unions grew up, particularly company or enterprise based unions, often in foreign owned firms. A key figure in the Bombay labour movement in the early 1950s, was George Fernandes. He was a central figure in the unionisation of sections of Bombay labour in the 1950s.
Bombay's Bollywood film industry grew rapidly as it received intense political attention and new sources of governmental funding after 1947. This enabled the industry to embark on technological innovations and to establish effective systems for nationwide distributions. The enormous growth in spectatorship and cinema halls throughout the country soon established Bombay cinema as the dominant Indian film industry. In April 1950, Greater Bombay District came into existence with the merger of Bombay Suburbs and Bombay City. It spanned an area of and inhabited 23.39 lakhs of people in 1951. The Municipal Corporation limits were extended up to Jogeshwari along the Western Railway and Bhandup along the Central Railway. This limit was further extended in February 1957 up to Dahisar along the Western Railway and Mulund on the Central Railway. The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, one of the finest institutions in the country in science and technology, was established in 1958 at Powai, a northern suburb of Bombay, with assistance from UNESCO and with funds contributed by the Soviet Union.
Battle of Bombay.
The desire to domesticate cosmopolitan Bombay within a Marathi social and linguistic framework was strongly expressed in the 1950s. On 13 May 1946, a session of the Marathi literary conference held at Belgaum, unanimously resolved on the formation of a united Marathi state. Consequently, the Samyukta Maharashtra Parishad (United Maharashtra Conference) was formed on 28 September 1946, to unite all Marathi-speaking territories into a single political unit. The Parishad consisted of political leaders from the Congress and other parties, and prominent literary figures. It presented its point of view to the States Reorganisation Committee. The States Reorganisation Committee, which has submitted its report to the Indian Government in 1955, recommended a bilingual state for Maharashtra–Gujarat with Bombay as its capital. The report also respected Gujarati susceptibilities over Bombay City. The Maharashtrians wanted Bombay as a part of Maharashtra, since it had majority of Marathi speakers. However, the city's economic and political elite feared that Bombay would decline under a government committed to developing the rural hinterland. Bombay Citizens' Committee, an advocacy group composed of leading Gujarati industrialists lobbied for Bombay's independent status.
In the "Lok Sabha" discussions on 15 November 1955, S. K. Patil, a Marathi-speaking Congress Member of Parliament (MP) from Bombay, demanded that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state, laying great stress on its cosmopolitan character. On 20 November 1955, the Bombay Pradesh Congress Committee organized a public meeting at the Chowpatty beach in Bombay, where S. K. Patil and Congressman Morarji Desai, the then Chief Minister of Bombay State, made provocative statements on Bombay. Patil said that, "Maharashtra will not get Bombay for the next 5,000 years." On 21 November 1955, violent outbursts erupted, and there was a total "hartal" in Bombay. Thousands of angry protesters converged at Flora Fountain with a view to march peacefully towards the Council Hall, where the State Legislature was in session. The police used tear gas to disperse the crowd, but when it failed, they finally resorted to firing, killing 15 people. Under pressure from business interests in Bombay, it was decided to grant Bombay the status of a Union territory under a centrally-governed administration, setting aside the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Committee report. On 16 January 1956, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, announced the government's decision to create separate states of Maharashtra and Gujarat, but put Bombay City under central administration. Large demonstrations, mass meetings and riots soon followed. The Bombay Police dissolved the mass meetings and arrested several of the movement's leaders. During 16 January–22 January, police fired at demonstrators protesting the arrests, in which more than 80 people were killed.
The States Reorganisation Committee report was to be implemented on 1 November 1956. It caused a great political stir and, led to the establishment of the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti (United Maharashtra Committee) on 6 February 1956. The Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti was basically born from the Samyukta Maharashtra Parishad, but had an enlarged identity with broad representation from not only the Congress, but opposition parties, and independents as well. The Samiti spearheaded the demand for the creation of a separate Maharashtra state including Bombay out of the bilingual Bombay State using violent means. In the August 1956 discussions, the Union cabinet agreed on the creation of a bigger bilingual Bombay State including Maharashtra, Marathwada, Vidharbha, Gujarat, Saurashtra, Kutch, and Bombay City. In the second general elections of Bombay State held in 1957, the Samiti secured a majority of 101 seats out of 133 in Maharashtra. The Congress could secure only 32 seats out of 133 in Maharashtra, obtaining a bare majority of 13 out of 24 in Greater Bombay. The Congress suffered the same fate in Gujarat, winning only 57 out of 89 seats. The Congress however succeeded in forming a government in Bombay State with the support of Marathwada and Vidarbha. Yashwantrao Chavan became the first Chief Minister of the bilingual Bombay State. In 1959, he headed a cabinet of 15, out of which 4 represented Gujarat, to discuss the future of Bombay State. Chavan managed in convincing Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, who was elected President of the Indian National Congress in 1959, of the futility of the bilingual Bombay State, which was increasingly jeopardizing Congress prospects in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Finally on 4 December 1959, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) passed a resolution recommending the bifurcation of the Bombay State.
The Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti achieved its goal when Bombay State was reorganised on linguistic lines on 1 May 1960. Gujarati-speaking areas of Bombay State were partitioned into the state of Gujarat. Maharashtra State with Bombay as its capital was formed with the merger of Marathi-speaking areas of Bombay State, eight districts from Central Provinces and Berar, five districts from Hyderabad State, and numerous princely states enclosed between them. The pro-Samyukta Maharashtra writers claimed that in all 105 persons died in the 
battle for Bombay. As a memorial to the martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, Flora Fountain was renamed as "Hutatma Chowk" (Martyr's Square), and a memorial was erected, since it was the starting point of the agitation.
After the 1960 bifurcation, many Gujaratis left Bombay feeling that they would be better-off in Gujarat than in Bombay, and fearing that they would be neglected by the Maharashtra Government. The Maharashtrians also blamed the Gujaratis for the death of the 105 martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement.
Rise of Regionalism.
When large number of Marathi speakers arrived in Bombay after the creation of Maharashtra, they found themselves at the lower rungs of the labour market and in competition with skilled communities from other parts of India. The Marathi-speaking middle-class in Bombay, who had been the most consistent supporters of the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti, also experienced similar discrepancies. The Gujarati and Marwari communities owned majority of the industry and trade enterprises in the city, while the white-collar jobs were mainly sought by the South Indian migrants to the city.
This was the line taken by Bombay cartoonist and journalist Bal Thackeray in his weekly magazine "Marmik" (Satire), launched in 1963, which soon became one of the most popular magazines among Marathi speakers in Bombay. Backed by his father Prabodhankar Thackeray and a circle of friends, he established the Shiv Sena party on 19 June 1966, out of a feeling of resentment about the relative marginalization of Maharashtrians in Bombay. The Shiv Sena rallied against the South Indians, the Communists, the Gujarati city elite, and the Muslims in India. In the 1960s and 1970s, Shiv Sena cadres became involved in various attacks against the South Indian communities, vandalising South Indian restaurants and pressuring employers to hire Marathis.
The creation of New Bombay.
The need for urban development on the mainland across from Bombay Island was first officially recommended in the 1940s. In 1945, a Post-war development committee suggested that areas should be developed on the mainland on the opposite side of the harbour to contain the future growth of the city. In 1947, N. V. Modak and Albert Mayer published their plan, stressing on controlled development of the city, suburbs, and its satellite towns like Thane, Bassein, and Uran. In March 1964, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay submitted its development plan for Greater Bombay, which was criticized for various reasons, but approved in 1967. By that time, another plan had been developed by two of Bombay's leading architects Charles Correa and Pravin Mehta, and an engineer Shirish Patel. They suggested that a "twin city" of equal size and prominence to Greater Bombay, would only be able to solve the city's congestion problems. Thus, the idea of the creation of New Bombay was born.
The proposed site for New Bombay covered an area of , integrating 95 villages spread over the districts of Thane and Raigad.
21st century.
During the 21st century, the city suffered several bombings. On 6 December 2002, a bomb placed under a seat of an empty BEST (Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport) bus exploded near Ghatkopar station in Mumbai. Around 2 people were killed and 28 were injured. The bombing occurred on the tenth anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya. On 27 January 2003, a bomb placed on a bicycle exploded near the Vile Parle station in Mumbai. The bomb killed 1 and injured 25. The blast occurred a day ahead of the visit of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of India to the city. On 13 March 2003, a bomb exploded in a train compartment, as the train was entering the Mulund station in Mumbai. 10 people were killed and 70 were injured. The blast occurred a day after the tenth anniversary of the 1993 Bombay bombings. On 28 July 2003, a bomb placed under a seat of a BEST bus exploded in Ghatkopar. The bomb killed 4 people and injured 32. On 25 August 2003, two blasts in South Mumbai - one near the Gateway of India and the other at Zaveri Bazaar in Kalbadevi occurred. At least 44 people were killed and 150 injured. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but it had been hinted that the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba was behind the attacks.
Mumbai was lashed by torrential rains on 26–27 July 2005, during which the city was brought to a complete standstill. The city received 37 inches (940 millimeters) of rain in 24 hours — the most any Indian city has ever received in a single day. Around 83 people were killed. On 11 July 2006, a series of seven bomb blasts took place over a period of 11 minutes on the Suburban Railway in Mumbai at Khar, Mahim, Matunga, Jogeshwari, Borivali, and one between Khar and Santa Cruz. 209 people were killed and over 700 were injured. According to Mumbai Police, the bombings were carried out by Lashkar-e-Toiba and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). In 2008, the city experienced xenophobic attacks by the activists of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) under Raj Thackeray on the North Indian migrants in Mumbai. Attacks included assault on North Indian taxi drivers and damage of their vehicles. There were a series of ten coordinated terrorist attacks by 10 armed Pakistani men using automatic weapons and grenades which began on 26 November 2008 and ended on 29 November 2008. The attacks resulted in 164 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several important buildings.

Julius Genachowski

Julius Genachowski (born August 19, 1962) is an American lawyer and businessman. He became the Federal Communications Commission Chairman on June 29, 2009. On March 22, 2013, he announced he would be leaving the FCC in the coming weeks. On January 6, 2014, it was announced that Genachowski had joined The Carlyle Group.
Early life and education.
Genachowski was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, and grew up in Great Neck, New York, the son of Adele and Azriel Genachowski. He attended yeshiva and studied in Israel. He entered Columbia College of Columbia University as a pre-med student, but earned a Bachelor of Arts in History (1985) "magna cum laude". He was an Editor of the "Columbia Daily Spectator". After working in Washington, D.C., for former New York Congressman Chuck Schumer, he entered Harvard Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (1991), also "magna cum laude". He was a Notes Editor at the "Harvard Law Review" when his classmate Barack Obama was its president. Genachowski clerked for The Honorable Abner J. Mikva on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and then for Justices William J. Brennan and David Souter at the U.S. Supreme Court.
Government and business experience.
Genachowski was on the staffs of the Select Committee investigating the Iran-Contra Affair and then U.S. Representative Chuck Schumer. In 1994 FCC Chairman Reed Hundt hired him as a senior legal advisor; he was chief counsel 1996-1997.
He was Chief of Business Operations and a member of Barry Diller's Office of the Chairperson at IAC/InterActiveCorp and executive responsible for the creation of Fox Broadcasting Company and USA Broadcasting. He earned at least $2.5 million when Vivendi acquired Universal assets in 2003. He had previously served on the Boards of Directors of Expedia, Hotels.com, and Ticketmaster.
Genachowski was a co-founder of LaunchBox Digital and Rock Creek Ventures; a Special Advisor at General Atlantic; and a member of the Boards of Directors at The Motley Fool, Web.com, Mark Ecko Enterprises, and Beliefnet. In April 2006, he was appointed to the Board of JackBe.
He served on the Board of Common Sense Media, a leading organization seeking to improve the media lives of children and families and the Advisory Board of Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2). He also helped found the New Resource Bank, the country’s first commercial green bank.
On January 6, 2014, it was announced that Genachowski returned to the corporate world to take a post at The Carlyle Group. There he will reportedly concentrate on global technology, media, and telecommunications investments.
Obama campaign and transition.
For Senator Barack Obama's 2008 Presidential Campaign, Genachowski was Chairperson of the Technology, Media and Telecommunications Policy Working Group, which created the Obama Technology and Innovation Plan. He also advised and guided the Campaign’s innovative use of technology and the Internet for grassroots engagement and participation.
After the November election, he co-led the Technology, Innovation, and Government Reform Group for President-Elect Obama's Transition Team. On January 12, 2009, several news outlets reported that Genachowski would be President-Elect Obama's choice to head the FCC. This was confirmed by a press release on March 3, 2009.
Tenure as FCC Chairman.
On June 25, 2009, the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed Julius Genachowski as FCC Chairman. "Wired" named “A New FCC” one of the “Top 7 Disruptions of the Year” after Genachowski announced plans to create the country’s first national broadband plan, reallocate spectrum from over-the-air TV broadcasters to meet demand for wireless usage, and pursue rules to preserve Internet freedom and openness.
According to an opinion piece by Genachowski, wireless providers increased wireless infrastructure investment more than 60% between 2009 and 2013 and the United States led the world in the deployment and adoption of 4G/LTE mobile broadband. A study by the ITIF made similar assertions. However, numerous press outlets subsequently questioned the findings. Businessweek called the U.S. a “wireless backwater” prior to 2008, while Genachowski praised the mobile industry for “America’s leadership in mobile” in 2009.
In terms of wired broadband, the Genachowski FCC reported that networks capable of 100 megabits per second passed less than 20% of U.S. homes in 2009 and over 80% in 2012, putting the U.S. near the top of the world in deployment of broadband infrastructure. This followed announcements of upgrade plans by cable operators in 2008. According to an opinion piece by Genachowski, American firms installed more fiber optic cable for high-speed broadband in 2011 and 2012 than those of any nation other than China, and more than all European nations combined.
Genachowski announced his resignation on March 22, 2013. He will join the Aspen Institute as a senior fellow. In addition, he announced in January, 2014 that, upon leaving the FCC, he would begin work for the Carlyle Group.
National Broadband Plan.
On March 16, 2010, Genachowski released a National Broadband Plan, titled “Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan”. The plan lays out a vision for a U.S. strategic advantage in broadband. It includes more than 200 recommendations, including proposals to reallocate airwaves for mobile broadband and to modernize the FCC’s $9 billion per year Universal Service Fund from a program that supports phone service to a program that efficiently supports broadband. Proponents had argued that lack of a national plan put the United States at a competitive disadvantage compared to nations with developed broadband plans.
The plan was released to generally positive reviews from public interest and business leaders. Some public interest advocates expressed concern that the plan did not propose to foster more competition in a broadband market. For example, the broadband plan found there to be “reasons to be concerned about wireline broadband competition in the United States.”
President Obama commended the plan, and the Obama administration endorsed the spectrum goal in a speech by National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers. At the end of Genachowski’s tenure, 87 percent of the action agenda had been acted upon. Additional agenda items were never provided.
Connect America Fund.
Under Genachowski, the FCC overhauled the $9 billion per year Universal Service Fund (USF) into a program that supports universal broadband service rather than phone service. The new Connect America Fund was approved unanimously by the FCC in October 2011 and launched in April 2012, and maintains the same annual budget as USF.
The FCC projects the Connect America Fund will help connect over 19 million Americans to broadband, mostly in rural areas. In July 2012, the FCC announced the first phase of the program which, over three years, pairs $115 million in public funds with private investment to bring high-speed Internet to 400,000 residents and businesses that lack access.
As part of the reforms, the FCC identified mobile broadband as a Universal Service goal for the first time. The Connect America Fund includes a Mobility Fund specifically to bring 3G and 4G wireless broadband to unserved areas.
Spectrum crunch.
Genachowski has warned of a “spectrum crunch” of public airwaves, in which demand for mobile broadband service outstrips the availability of spectrum. Numerous experts have disputed claims that a “spectrum crunch” exists.
Genachowski and his team have pushed for incentive auctions of broadcast television spectrum—a proposal in the National Broadband Plan to allow spectrum license-holders to supply spectrum for auction and receive a share of the proceeds. The plan received criticism from some television broadcasters, who said it favored mobile broadband deployment goals over their industry.
The auctions gained bipartisan support from U.S. lawmakers and praise from wireless and tech companies as a way to promote investment in wireless networks and drive further innovation.
Incentive auctions were passed by U.S. Congress and adopted into law as part of the deal to extend the payroll tax cut. Genachowski announced the process would be advised by a team of auction economics experts, led by economist Paul Milgrom.
Genachowski has pushed for spectrum sharing between current government and commercial wireless users in order to improve network capacity. He has also advocated for the preservation and use of unlicensed spectrum bands as platforms for innovation, citing the success of Wi‑Fi, which uses unlicensed spectrum. The FCC has set aside spectrum for unlicensed use.
In February 2013, the FCC voted unanimously on a Genachowski proposal to free up wireless spectrum that will increase Wi-Fi speeds and ease network congestion in homes and at major hubs, like conferences, airports, hotels etc. It is the largest block of unlicensed spectrum made available for Wi-Fi in over a decade, and adds an additional 195 MHz of spectrum in the 5 GHz band. NPR’s Marketplace called the vote a “rare moment of unanimity in Washington.”
Mergers and acquisitions.
Under Genachowski, the FCC approved the Comcast NBC merger in January 2011. The FCC and Department of Justice applied a number of public interest conditions to promote online competition in the video marketplace. Unfortunately, according to the FCC, the price of multichannel video has continued to rise. In June 2012, Comcast agreed to pay an $800,000 settlement for allegedly violating their agreement with the FCC to market an affordable, standalone broadband deal that was not tied to cable television plans.
In November 2011, following an August 2011 announcement by the Department of Justice that the merger would be opposed, the FCC moved to block AT&T’s proposed $39 billion bid for rival T-Mobile. The merger would have combined the second and fourth-largest cellphone carriers in the country, resulting in the largest concentration in U.S. wireless market in history. AT&T withdrew their application days later. AT&T competitors have sought to improve their market position with a proposed merger between T-Mobile/MetroPCS and a major investment in Sprint Nextel by Japan’s Softbank.
Consumer empowerment and protection.
Connect2Compete.
Genachowski announced the launch of Connect2Compete in 2011, an initiative to help close the digital divide by expanding broadband and computer access to low-income households. Connect2Compete offers under $10 per month broadband access and under $150 laptops to households with a child enrolled in the national school lunch program. It is a partnership with Internet service providers, technology companies, and nonprofits, run outside government and funded by in-kind commitments. In May 2012, Connect2Compete launched a pilot program to expand access in San Diego. It reports billions of dollars in commitments and plans to launch in all 50 states.
Gigabit City Challenge.
In January 2013, Genachowski launched a “Gigabit City Challenge” to engage with broadband providers and state and local leaders to ensure ultrafast gigabit Internet is available in at least one community in all fifty states by 2015. As part of the initiative, Genachowski announced plans to hold workshops and create best practices resources to help reach the goal.
Combating bill shock.
In 2011 the FCC and wireless carriers reached an agreement to combat bill shock when consumers receive unexpected overage charges. Smartphone and tablet wireless data users now receive alerts when they near an overage charge.
Leading Education by Advancing Digital (LEAD).
Genachowski launched an effort with U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to encourage the spread of digital textbooks and create a blueprint on how to harness technology for education reform. In 2012 the FCC and Department of Education joined with technology and education leaders to form the Leading Education by Advancing Digital (LEAD) Commission to analyze trends and present policy and funding recommendations. LEAD is co-chaired by Columbia University President Lee Bollinger, TPG Capital co‑founder James Coulter, former Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings and Common Sense Media founder and CEO James Steyer.
Data roaming.
Genachowski led a successful effort to pass data roaming rules so consumers have access to wireless Internet even in areas their provider does not cover. The rules passed on a 3‑2 vote in April 2011. The rules require Verizon and AT&T to enter into roaming agreements with smaller carriers in order to preserve industry competition.
Health Care.
Genachowski launched a Healthcare Connect Fund in 2012 to expand access to broadband for health care. The fund is capped at $400 million and will help bring modern, cost-saving telehealth technology to rural hospitals and clinics. Genachowski also led an effort to provide spectrum for wireless medical technology—called Medical Area Body Networks (mBANs)—that monitor patients’ vital signs to improve outcomes and lower costs.
Public files of TV stations.
The FCC also passed a rule to require local television stations to put their public files online. The rule modernized the existing agency rule that requires public files available at television stations in physical filing cabinets. The rule was proposed in an FCC report “The Information Needs of Communities”, commissioned by Genachowski and authored by Steve Waldman in 2011. Since 1938, broadcasters have been required to make a file available to the public containing information on station advertising and other topics. The new rule was passed in April 2012, and initially ABC, NBC, Fox, and CBS stations in the top 50 markets will have to put their file online—in 2014, all TV stations will be required to comply. Broadcasters resisted the requirement and claimed that administrative costs would be high. Public interest groups and editorial boards such as "Bloomberg News" endorsed the rule.
Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA).
In January 2012, the FCC released a report and order on implementation of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA), which updates federal law to increase the access of persons with disabilities to modern communications. Among the reforms was a rule moving Internet video previously shown on television to closed captioning.
Net neutrality.
While chief technology advisor to President-Elect Obama, Genachowski was a strong advocate of a net neutrality principle. Net neutrality principles were first articulated at the FCC by Republican Chairmen Michael Powell and Kevin Martin, and were endorsed in a unanimous FCC policy statement in 2005. Support for codifying net neutrality came from public interest groups, venture capitalists, wireless carriers such as Sprint and Clearwire, and a coalition including Google, Amazon, Twitter and others. Support for the net neutrality principle was also a campaign promise of Barack Obama. Opposition largely came from dominant Internet service providers.
In May 2010, the FCC proposed an Open Internet Order with net neutrality rules that required wireline Internet service providers to not block websites or impose certain limits on users; wireless providers were given greater freedom to interfere with consumer’s Internet access. In December 2010, the FCC passed a final version on a 3-2 vote.
President Obama issued a statement of support, and later threatened to veto any House legislation to repeal the rules. Support also came from a number of business and technology leaders and public interest groups. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson backed the rules as a way to eliminate regulatory uncertainty. The rules received criticism from Verizon, which argued they exceed the FCC’s authority, and from some public interest groups such as Free Press, which argued the rules were too narrow and should be expanded. Verizon Wireless and Free Press sued the FCC, although Free Press dropped its lawsuit.
In 2012, Genachowski appointed Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain to chair an FCC Open Internet Advisory Committee created to evaluate the effectiveness of the neutrality rules. The group is made up of representatives from Mozilla, Netflix, the Center for Democracy and Technology, AT&T, Internet Society, Comcast, Disney, and others. As of April 2013, no evaluation has been provided to the public.
In July 2012, during the FCC review of Verizon Wireless’ purchase of spectrum held by cable operators, the FCC settled an investigation into Verizon Wireless over violation of open Internet rules on its 700 MHz spectrum. The FCC found the Verizon had asked Google to remove applications from the Android marketplace that allow “tethering” to turn smartphones into Wi-Fi hotspots. Verizon had typically charged a “tethering fee” of $20 for their service. As part of the settlement, Verizon agreed to pay $1.25 million to the U.S. Treasury.
International.
Genachowski has promoted an international Multistakeholder Model of Internet governance to protect Internet freedom and warned against proposed new regulations by the International Telecommunications Union, an arm of the UN, that could result in a more government-oriented, top-down model of internet governance.
In November 2012, Genachowski and his Mexican counterpart signed an initiative to combat theft of mobile devices and their sale across the border. Under the program, wireless carriers will build and maintain an international database to prevent stolen devices from being reactivated in Mexico or the United States. Earlier in the year, major U.S. carriers signed an agreement with the FCC to begin disabling stolen devices within the United States.
Public Safety Initiatives.
Genachowski and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg unveiled the nation’s first comprehensive emergency notification system for cellphones at Ground Zero in May 2011. The Personal Localized Alerting Network (PLAN) is a free service to send emergency text alerts to citizens in an area with “imminent threats to safety.” It is a partnership between the FCC, FEMA, New York City, and wireless carriers. Genachowski has also announced a plan to create a “Next Generation 911” emergency response system that will enable text, video, and photo messages and automatic location information to be sent to 911.
In response to a nationwide rise in smartphone theft and related assaults, Genachowski, major city police chiefs, and wireless providers launched a national database to track stolen smartphones. The initiative will allow users to disable use of their device once reported stolen, lowering the black market value. From mid-2011 to mid-2012, roughly one in three robberies nationwide involved theft of a cellphone, according to the FCC. The four largest wireless carriers are expected to put databases in place by 2013, and complete a merged database in 2014.
Genachowski has campaigned against “distracted driving”, or the use of mobile devices or texting applications while driving. In 2009, Genachowski and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood launched a campaign to reform laws and change social norms. He has advocated in the media and testified before the Senate, and spurred awareness campaigns such as AT&T’s “It Can’t Wait” initiative. Over 100,000 car crashes each year involve texting, according to the National Safety Council.
Personal.
His parents are Eastern European Jews who survived the Holocaust. His cousin, Menachem Genack, is an Orthodox rabbi and the CEO of the Orthodox Union Kosher Division. He is married to Rachel Goslins.
Genachowski was named by President Barack Obama to lead the United States delegation for the commemoration of the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.
He plays in a regular weekend basketball game with former Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig, Federal Trade Commission chairman Jon Leibowitz, Hans Binnendijk of the National Defense University, Yochi Dreazen, a reporter for the "National Journal", and Tom Freedman, senior adviser under President Bill Clinton.

Portugal–Serbia relations

Portuguese-Serbian relations date back to 1917. Portugal has an embassy in Belgrade, and Serbia has an embassy in Lisbon. Despite support by Portugal for the independence of Kosovo, Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetković is keen to improve bilateral cooperation. Portugal is backing Serbia's accession to the European Union (EU).
History.
Portugal established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Serbia on October 19, 1917. Relations continued with the successor Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Portuguese recognized the government in exile of this state after the German occupation of 1941. Relations with the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which took power in 1945 after World War II, were only established in 1974 after the Portuguese Carnation Revolution. Following the dissolution of the SFR of Yugoslavia during the Yugoslav wars, Portugal maintained relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, later reconstituted as Serbia and Montenegro and finally as the Republic of Serbia after Montenegro declared its independence in July 2006.
In April 1999, Portugal participated in the NATO bombing of Serbia from the Aviano Air Base in Italy. Portugal also provided troops as part of NATO peacekeeping efforts in the breakaway Serbian province of Kosovo in 1999. In April 1999 Serbia filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice regarding Portugal's use of force in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. As of 2007, Portugal still had about 300 troops in Kosovo.
Economic relations.
In the January–October 2006 period bilateral trade between Serbia and Portugal were estimated at US$12.7 million.

2007 Grand National

The 2007 Grand National (known as the John Smith's Grand National for sponsorship reasons) was the 160th official annual running of the world-famous Grand National steeplechase which took place at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool, England, on 14 April 2007 and attracted the maximum permitted field of forty competitors for a total prize money of £700,000 including £399,140 to the winner.
33-1 shot Silver Birch, ridden by Robbie Power, edged out McKelvey to win the race by three-quarters of a length. Joint-favourite Point Barrow, at odds of 8-1, fell at the first fence. The meeting was attended by around 70,000 spectators at Aintree, and an estimated 16 million adults placed bets on the race.
Runners and betting.
2005 Scottish Grand National winner Joe's Edge was the long-time ante-post favourite but public money on race day came for 2006 Irish Grand National winner Point Barrow after being tipped by several morning newspaper tipsters but the big plunge bets went on the heavyweight Monkerhostin who had recently run well in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Not surprisingly the two former winners in the race, Hedgehunter, under the 11 stone 12 lb top weight and Numbersixvalverde were both heavily supported, along with Longshanks who had twice been placed in the Topham Trophy over one circuit of the course, and the 2006 Summer National winner McKelvey.
The race.
Cloudy Bays broke the tape when the runners were sent off for the first time, resulting in a false start. The long delay in getting the runners set again had many on their toes and they set off at a very fast pace second time. By then Cloudy Bays had little interest in taking part and was left by thirty lengths at the start.
Joint-favourite Point Barrow caused a huge groan from the stands and for millions watching on television by falling at the first fence, ending debutant rider Philip Carberry's National within a minute of it starting. Another debut rider, Wayne Hutchinson was left hanging on to his mount Tikram until finally being unseated as the horse went to jump the second fence.
The Outlier was the first to emerge as the leader and was tracked by Bewley's Berry, Naunton Brook and Ballycassidy as the field successfully negotiated the fences down to the sixth, Becher's Brook.
At the famous brook, Dominic Elsworth found himself falling off his mount Le Duc when he shouted to nearby rival Mick Fiztgerald on board Kelami for help. Fitzgerald pushed Elsworth only for the rider to remain unbalanced and fall off the other side instead. At the same fence Jack High crumpled on landing and fell, while Davy Russell was also thrown from Livingstone Bramble, requiring a trip to hospital for precautionary X-rays on his back.
As the field continued towards the seventh fence (Foinavon) Zabenz was pulled up, a stirrup leather having broken. Monkerhostin's rider Richard Johnson was also having to contend with a broken stirrup leather but his horse was not enjoying the experience and dug his heels in at Foinavon and refused.
Naunton Brook was now in the lead as the field took the 90-degree Canal Turn with Bewley's Berry, Ballycassidy and The Outlier next. Only Tom Doyle was caught out by the sharp turn and was ejected from Knowhere out the side, while right behind them Kandjar D'allier was baulked by two loose horses and crashed into the fence, almost bringing down Homer Wells in the process.
Of the thirty-one remaining only Royal Auclair failed to negotiate the four fences along the canal side that took the field back onto the race course for the first time, falling at the first of those, Valentine's brook, badly hampering Eurotrek. 
Naunton Brook and Ballycassidy continued to set the pace as the runners came in front of the stands and made their way towards The Chair. Gallant Approach survived a bad mistake here which put him out of centention, while Cloudy Bays refused when tailed off. Dun Doire was also tailed off at this stage as the field of twenty-nine runners took the water jump and began the second circuit.
The front running Naunton Brook began to show signs of fatigue as Ballcycassidy and Bewley's Berry now took the field over the fences down to Becher's. The Outlier unshipped his rider at the 19th fence (open ditch) as well as Idle Talk, who was already beaten when he dropped a foreleg into the ditch and failed to take off. Billyvoddan was the first of the tailenders to pull up before taking the fence, and the last of the disappointing joint-favourites, Joe's Edge, did the same before the 20th when he was found to have gone lame. Both Homer Wells and Eurotrek had been struggling since they were hampered earlier in the race by fallers. Now with their chances gone they were both pulled up before Becher's Brook along with another tail ender, Celtic Son to leave twenty-two runners still racing.
Bewley's Berry was out in front and cantering when he was caught out by the steep drop at Becher's and fell, leaving Simon and Libertine in front while Graphic Approach was losing touch when he fell, while Naunton Brook was pulled up after jumping the brook.
By the second jump of the Canal Turn, Bothar Na, Sonevafushi and Kelami were losing touch. Puntal, Clan Royal, Gallant Approach and Dun Doire were beaten and tailed off.
Ballycassidy was beginning to slow when he turned too sharply and threw his rider, while at the next fence (Valentine's) Simon came down when in second place. Slim Pickings moved into the lead at the next and by the third-last was at the head of a group of ten runners that still carried chances of winning. 
The long run to the second-last flight spread the pack out with Slim Pickings taking the fence just ahead of Silver Birch. At the last, Silver Birch landed just in front and began to get away from Slim Pickings on the long run-in. At the elbow, Silver Birch began to labour and Slim Pickings fought back, with McKelvey finishing best. The finishing post came just in time for Silver Birch to win by three-quarters of a length, with McKelvey second by one-and-a-quarter lengths. Slim Pickings finished third, fifteen lengths in front of fourth placed Philson Run.
Libertine was fifth, Numbersixvalverde sixth, Longshanks seventh, Puntal eighth and Hedgehunter ninth, a distance ahead of L'ami in tenth, Clan Royal in eleventh, and Gallant Approach the last of twelve to complete. Dun Doire pulled up three fences from home, Sonevafushi and Bothar Na bypassed the second-last, and Kelami and Thisthatandtother missed out the final flight.
Aftermath.
The winning rider-trainer-owner combination were among the youngest and least experienced in the history of the race with just one National between them, being a previous ride for 25-year-old jockey Robbie Power. Trainer Gordon Elliott was the youngest in the race and won with his first National entrant while owner Brian Walsh had bought the horse for 20,000 guineas the previous year as the first horse to carry his colours in the race. With a 33/1 winner and only one horse placed at a shorter price it was also a good day for the bookmakers who retained much of the £250 million gambled in the United Kingdom alone on the race, as none of the three joint-favourites completed the course.
Starter Peter Haines came in for criticism for his handling of the start after the runners had charged the tape at the first attempt. Many race commentators felt that Haines was then too picky in trying to get a good line for the restart as he ordered the runners to turn back from the start five times before finally letting them go at the sixth attempt.
The race after the National had to be abandoned after Graphic Approach collapsed on the hurdles course suffering from concussion and heat stroke. The horse had fallen at Becher's Brook on the second circuit but continued riderless until the lest fence when the horse ran towards the crowd and tried to jump the fence into the spectators. In the days after the race the horse looked to be on the road to recovery but eventually had to be euthanised.
McKelvey was also found to have suffered an injury late in the race which would rule him out for almost the entire next season. The injury almost certainly cost him victory.
Winning jockey Robbie Power received a four-day ban from the stewards who found that during the run-in he had used his whip too often and also struck Silver Birch too near the stifle. Third-placed Barry Garaghty was also given a three-day ban for overuse of the whip on Slim Pickings.
Davy Russell required hospital treatment after being thrown from Livingstone Bramble at Becher's Brook on the first circuit for precautionary X-rays on his shoulder and back.
2007 was one of the warmest Nationals on record with temperatures at race time hitting 22 degrees Celsius.
Coverage.
The race was broadcast live on the BBC as a "Grandstand" special for the 48th consecutive year. However it was to be the last time the race was broadcast as a Grandstand special, as the programme was discontinued before the following year's race. The televising of the race included cameras inside the first fence and two cameras inside jockey's caps (Jamie Moore on Thisthatandtother and Tom Doyle on Knowhere). The programme was presented by Sue Barker and Clare Balding with summary from John Parrott, Richard Pitman and Norman Williamson. The race commentary team was Ian Bartlett, Tony O'Heir, Darren Owen and lead commentator Jim McGrath who called the runners home for the tenth year.
Jockeys.
With the retirement of Carl Llewellyn, Tony McCoy, Mick Fitzgerald and Paul Carberry took over as the most experienced riders in the weighing room, each taking their twelfth ride in the National. Fitzgerald had previously won in 1996 and Carberry in 1999 but McCoy became the eighth rider to have taken twelve rides without being winner or runner-up.
Eight riders made their Grand National debut, with Tom O'Brien finishing second, Daryl Jacob fourth and Sam Waley-Cohen fifth. Wayne Hutchinson and Philip Carberry's debuts both ended at the first fence, while Denis O'Regan, David Condon and Paul O'Neill also failed to complete the course.

<doc id="20095331" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20095331" title="Blue Ridge Road">
Blue Ridge Road

Blue Ridge Road is a long roadway in Essex County, New York, in the United States. The road is designated as County Route 84 (CR 84) from NY 28N in Newcomb to Interstate 87 (I-87) in North Hudson, and as New York State Route 910K (NY 910K) between I-87 and U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in North Hudson. The CR 84 portion is an , two-lane stretch of rural highway maintained by the Essex County Department of Public Works' Highway Division while NY 910K is a highway maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). All of Blue Ridge Road has been designated as the "Blue Ridge Road Scenic Byway" by NYSDOT.
Blue Ridge Road was designated as part of NY 73 in the 1930 renumbering of state routes in New York. NY 73 was truncated to Schroon in the mid-1930s.
Route description.
Blue Ridge Road consists of Essex County's CR 84, which composes the bulk of the route, and NY 910K, which is a short, state-maintained roadway connecting I-87 to US 9. The entirety of Blue Ridge Road is designated as the "Blue Ridge Road Scenic Byway", a New York State Scenic Byway, by NYSDOT.
County Route 84.
Blue Ridge Road begins at an intersection with NY 28N and CR 75 (Eaton Lane) in the area south of Tahawus (pronounced "ta-hawz"). The road heads to the northeast, initially paralleling the Hudson River, then intersects with CR 25 (Tahawus Road), which heads north to the hamlet of Tahawus. After that, the route diverges from the Hudson River, turning to the southeast and climbing slightly to the side of Pine Hill, before progressing downhill. At the base of the mountain, CR 84 crosses over Vanderwhacker Brook, which flows into nearby Vanderwhacker Pond. The road winds its way around several different mountain peaks, passing to the north of Cheney Pond.
After passing through the hamlet of Boreas River, CR 84 briefly follows Wolf Pond Brook, which eventually turns north for nearby Wolf Pond. The road continues eastward past Sand Pond and begins to descend, roughly following Sand Pond Brook. It passes along the base of Ragged Mountain, a high peak in the Adirondacks, after which the road runs along the edge of the valley of the stream known as "The Branch." At the base of Three Brothers Mountain, CR 84 curves northeast before making a turn to the southeast, soon entering the hamlet of Blue Ridge. 
With The Branch still paralleling to the south, CR 84 continues its eastward descent and eventually intersects with its first road in several miles, Lazy Street, which provides access to the creek. At the base of Nippletop Mountain, Blue Ridge Road passes along the north shore of Palmer Pond, a small pond visible from the Adirondack Northway (I-87). Soon after, Blue Ridge Road intersects with the ramps leading to and from the Northway and the county-maintained portion of Blue Ridge Road ends.
NY 910K.
The eastern end of Blue Ridge Road, beginning at the ramps to and from the Adirondack Northway, is maintained by NYSDOT as NY 910K. The route heads eastward from the Northway ramps to nearby US 9. On this stretch, there is one intermediate intersection, this being with an unnamed roadway. The route ends at US 9 in the hamlet of North Hudson.
History.
The entirety of Blue Ridge Road was designated as the westernmost portion of NY 73 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 73 initially ran from NY 28N east to an intersection with US 9 in North Hudson, where NY 73 turned south to follow US 9 toward Schroon. The route was truncated to begin at US 9 in Schroon. NY 73's former alignment along Blue Ridge Road was redesignated as CR 2B by 1969. The section between the Northway and US 9 was later transferred to the state and assigned the NY 910K designation. On May 21, 2009, New York Governor David Paterson announced that stimulus money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act would be used to reconstruct the CR 84 segment of the Blue Ridge Road, seeing it as a major connector from NY 28N to I-87.

Andreas Hyperius

Andreas Gerhard Hyperius (1511–1564), real name Andreas Gheeraerdts, was a Protestant theologian. He was Flemish, born at Ypres.
Life.
He had a humanist education, and studied at Tournai and Paris. He was resident in England from 1536 to 1540, and in 1542 was appointed professor of theology at Marburg.
Works.
His theology lies between Lutheran and Reformed beliefs. Influenced by Martin Butzer, he was not a strict Lutheran. Jean Calvin endorsed his erudition.
He wrote the first Protestant text, "De formandis concionibus sacris" (On the Making of Sacred Discourses), solely devoted to systematic homiletics, in other words preaching considered as a branch of rhetoric. It was translated in English by John Ludham, as "The Practise of Preaching" (1577). Another English translation by Ludham was "A Speciall Treatise of Gods Providence" (c. 1588). Dietrich Bonhoeffer emphasised the role Hyperius had played in early Protestantism.
The "Methodus theologiae" is a selection from, and method for reading, the Church Fathers.
In his overall approach, he sought a firm basis in the Bible, rigidly, and held that before practical theology can be put in force, it must be made a part of systematic theological study, and must not be taught fragmentarily. Demanding an immense amount of preliminary reading on the part of the student, covering all practical theology except missions, he held that such reading would involve preparation for the practical work of the ministry. All must be squared with the Bible, or, where the Bible did not contain specific data, with the commandments of love for God and one's neighbor.
In addition, he urged the preparation of a work on church government, including the data of the New Testament, relevant portions of church history, excerpts from the councils, papal decrees, Church Fathers, and works on dogmatics, liturgics, and related materials.

Goal modeling

A Goal Model is an element of Requirements Engineering that may also be used more widely in Business analysis. Related elements include Stakeholder analysis, Context analysis, and Scenarios, among other business and technical areas.
Principles.
Goals are objectives which a system should achieve through cooperation of actors in the intended software and in the environment. Goal modeling is especially useful in the early phases of a project. Projects may consider how the intended system meets organizational goals (see also ), why the system is needed and how the stakeholders’ interests may be addressed.
A goal model:
Notations.
There are several notations in use for goal models in software development, including:
Other notations have been proposed by researchers.
Goal modeling in i*.
The i* goal modeling notation provides two kinds of diagram:
i* shows each role (an actor, agent or position) as a large circle containing the goals, tasks, and resources which that role owns. Ownership in i* means that the role desires the satisfaction of its goals, either for its own benefit or for the benefit of some other role. Goals may be accompanied by "obstacles" (negative goals) to be surmounted. Non-functional goals can be modeled as "soft goals" in i*: they are diagrammed as clouds or indented ovals.
Goal modeling in KAOS.
The KAOS goal modeling notation provides a way of defining goals and obstacles, underpinned by a formal (mathematical) method of analysis.
Goal modeling in UML.
UML's Use case diagram provides a simple goal modeling notation. The bubbles name functional goals, so a Use case diagram forms a simple functions-only goal model: as Cockburn writes, use cases cover only the behavioral requirements. Roles are shown as actors (stickmen on the diagram), linked to the use cases in which they take part. The use cases are drawn as elliptical bubbles, representing desired behavioral goals.
With the addition of "Misuse cases", the notation can model both desired goals and active threats. The misuse case notation shows negative (possibly hostile) stakeholders as the primary actors for the misuse cases; these may be grouped on the right-hand side of the diagram. The notation may assist in discovering suitable mitigating or preventative goals, shown as subsidiary use cases. These often have the aim of improving security, safety, or reliability, which are non-functional goals. Non-functional requirements can to some extent be described in use case style using Misuse cases to define negative goals; but the (positive) goals thus discovered are often functional. For example, if theft is a threat to security, then fitting locks is a mitigation; but that a door can be locked is a functional requirement.

Formerly a senior fellow at Chatham House ("The Royal Institute of International Affairs") in London, he has been associated with a number of think tanks in the United States and Europe.
Life.
The early focus of his work was post-Communist transition in Eastern Europe and Russia, such as in his first book, "Czechoslovakia: The Velvet Revolution and Beyond" (Palgrave Macmillan/St. Martins Press, 2000), which dealt with the post-communist reform process. His research and commentary have since branched out into transatlantic relations, European politics and the relationship between the Western world and the State of Israel. Before entering the think tank world, he was a foreign correspondent for The Times in Moscow.

Otto Liebermann

Otto Liebermann (24 November 1898 - 6 April 1974) was a chemist who invented a synthesis of dolomite.
Early life and education.
Liebermann was born on 24 November 1898 in Jasło (Galicia, then part of Austria-Hungary, now Poland). His father Alois came originally from Pilsen (Czech Republic and had started out working in the Oderfurter Mineraloelwerke at Ostrau (near Halle (Saale), Germany); he subsequently went to Galicia to work as a manager in the oil fields there and eventually became Technical Director of Nafta A.G. in Lemberg (now Lviv, Ukraine). Eventually Alois Liebermann started developing oil fields in Galicia, first on his own and then with partners.
Otto Liebermann was educated from 1904 to 1908 at the elementary school of Lviv, and at the "Gymnasium" of Lviv from 1908 to 1914. In 1914 his parents and their children (Otto, his two brothers Karl and Arthur and his sister Olga) moved to Vienna, where on 4 May 1916 Otto graduated from the "Staatsgymnasium". Being a citizen of Vienna, Otto Liebermann was conscripted into the Austrian army and served from 1916 to 1918. (One year later Otto Liebermann officially became a citizen of Austria). The end of World War I made it possible for him to enroll at the University of Vienna to study chemistry and physics, where he obtained his Ph.D. on 30 October 1922 with a dissertation titled "Über die Einwirkung von Schwefelsäure auf höhere diprimäre Glykolen" (On the effects of sulfuric acid on higher di-primary glycoles). See also the paper with the same title by A. Franke and O. Liebermann (1923), which appeared in the "Monatshefte für Chemie und verwandte Teile anderer Wissenschaften, Wien", vol.43, pp. 589–599. From 1922 to 1925 Dr. O. Liebermann worked as a chemist at the "Allchemin (Allgemeine Chemische Industrie A.-G.)" factory in Vienna. From 1925 to 1928 Otto Liebermann was employed by the "Aktiengesellschaft fur Mineralol-Industrie" (formerly "David Fanto & Co."), Vienna.
Otto Liebermann married Stella Schacherl in 1929; two daughters were born to them: Eva Eugenia in 1931 and Luiza in 1933.
Otto Liebermann became involved with the family business in 1928 and worked as the Managing and Technical Director of his father's oil fields in Potok, Galicia from 1929 to 1939, and he prospected for oil in the surrounding areas. His daughter Luiza remembered how her father became greatly interested in dolomite rocks because of their close association with oil deposits.
In May 1939 the Liebermann family was able to board the last boat leaving from Gdynia (Poland) before the outbreak of the Second World War. This chilling episode has been sketched by Otto Liebermann as follows: "In September 1938 Austrian passports were declared invalid and had to be exchanged for German ones. Failure to obey would result in deportation by the Polish Authorities. In autumn 1938 the Germans expelled people originating from Poland who lived in Germany and Austria. Thereupon the Polish Authorities made preparations to have their own back by doing the same and forcibly deported Austrian and German residents. Our passports were taken away, but after several days these were returned. At the same time it was made clear that we should leave Poland as soon as possible. In the late winter of 1938, when the threat of deportation was made, a tip-off by an acquaintance (a very old man) enabled me to hide in a wooden hut in the forest, until it was safe to return home. However this resulted in double pneumonia which combined with my angina made life very difficult. After much effort visas for emigration to Bolivia were obtained and we left Poland in early June 1939 with transit visas via England and Chile. We were only able to take vital personal belongings and no money, as exporting money was strictly forbidden. On arrival in England some complications developed and our departure was delayed and the German visas almost expired. In August 1939 visas were extended, but the outbreak of war in September prevented our departure for Bolivia. During the war I had enormous difficulties to fund our existence. In June 1940 I was interned on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien, and was released on medical grounds a year later. After internment I worked in a chemical laboratory of a metal factory carrying out very boring repetitive analytical work. At the end of the war I joined the firm of Jenson and Nicholson, who manufactured Berger paints, as a research chemist developing new paints and varnishes for the domestic and commercial markets. It took many years until we managed to have a modest home and in 1947 I was granted British nationality."
The Liebermann family lived in a house in Ilford (Essex), at the address mentioned in Otto Liebermann's 1967 paper in the science journal "Nature": 29 de Vere Gardens, Cranbrook, Ilford. Unfortunately, Otto Liebermann was not able to obtain employment in the oil industry and spent the years after the war until retirement working as Chief Chemist at the paint factory. In 1963 the journal "Paint Technology" printed two different papers on Dr. Liebermann's work at the Jenson and Nicholson Ltd. paint factory. Only after retirement Otto Liebermann could do what he had always wanted to do: his own research on dolomite. As his daughter Luiza recalled: "29 de Vere Gardens was a large house and when my sister and I left home my parents let the upstairs as a flat, converting a small bedroom into a kitchen. I can't remember the exact sequence of events but eventually they ceased to have tenants and Dad took over the upstairs kitchen as his laboratory. He was completely self financed and it was in the kitchen of 29 De Vere Gardens that he synthesized dolomite, the work he had had to leave for so many years because of the war." In March 1974 his wife Stella died, and only three weeks later on 6 April 1974 Otto Liebermann died in Ilford.

Vera Bradford

Vera Florence Bradford (5 September 19046 January 2004) was an Australian classical pianist and teacher, with a very long career. Her playing was admired for its depth and beauty of tone, classical unity and tremendous power.
Vera Bradford was born in Melbourne to a musical family. Her mother Edith was a pianist, and her father Frederick and brother Cec were violinists. She started learning the piano at the age of seven, and she graduated from the University of Melbourne Conservatorium in 1927, with the highest honours. In 1928 she took up a scholarship with Percy Grainger in Chicago. (Grainger and his wife Ella became close friends of Vera’s, and Ella always stayed with Vera on Percy's visits to Australia.) She also studied at the Chicago Musical College with Rudolph Ganz and Alexander Raab. It was Raab who introduced her to the technique that made her famous, the 'arm weight' technique of the Russian teacher Theodor Leschetizky, which she had first experienced when seeing Benno Moiseiwitsch perform in Melbourne in the 1920s. It was this which developed the big tone and control that became a feature of her performances of the works of Brahms, Rachmaninoff and Liszt. Raab insisted she not play the piano for a year, so that she could unlearn her previous techniques, and practise with the piano lid down. 
Her debut was in 1931 at the Chicago Opera House where she played the "Hungarian Gypsy Airs" by Sophie Menter, orchestrated by Tchaikovsky. This was followed by a long and triumphant career as a concert pianist in which she gave many first Australian performances – George Gershwin's Concerto in F, Richard Strauss's "Burleske in D minor" (1937), the Sophie Menter piece mentioned above, Debussy's "Feux d'artifices", and works by Bartók and William Walton. She played extensively in Australia and with the fledgling Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) orchestras before World War II, and after the war undertook a number of overseas tours. In 1946 she was the first Australian woman to perform the Brahms concertos, which the ABC and Bernard Heinze had previously considered too difficult for a woman. The critic Neville Cardus wrote of a performance of the D minor concerto with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra: "Miss Bradford put forth a strength which many men might envy or fear. It was virtuoso playing of a rare order".
The same attitude had prevailed when she was contracted to premiere Richard Strauss's "Burleske" with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in 1937. The visiting Finnish conductor Georg Schnéevoigt discovered the pianist was a woman and demanded she be replaced by a male pianist; but Vera Bradford was not one to be intimidated, and she gave an excellent performance.
For many years she was a teacher at Melbourne University. In 1963 she represented Australia at the 2nd International Music Festival in Seoul, Korea and visited Japan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. For some time in the 1960s she taught students in a private home in Frankston and was loved by her pupils. She continued to be active in music well into the 1970s, being the first pianist to perform a recital for Melbourne television However, for a time during this period, she was excluded from any ABC engagements, due to difficulties she had with the General Manager, Sir Charles Moses, and her recordings were banned from However in 2010, following a listener request to ABC FM broadcaster Colin Fox (Weekend Breakfast)ABC Radio recording were found from the archives and broadcast . In 1968 she formed the Frankston Music Society and the Frankston Symphony Orchestra, and performed with it on a number of occasions. She also arranged for young pianists such as Geoffrey Tozer and Ronald Farren-Price to appear with the orchestra.
Vera Bradford never married, preferring to focus her energies on her musical career.
She died on 6 January 2004, eight months short of her 100th birthday, at Tanderra Hostel in Camberwell, Melbourne. She often gave impromptu concerts there for her fellow guests, the last time being just two months before her death.
The Frankston campus of Monash University houses a large collection of Vera Bradford's items that she donated; it is known as the Vera Bradford Music Collection.

P. K. R. Warrier

P. K. Raghava Warrier FRCS () (13 August 1921 – 26 March 2011) was a cardiothoracic surgeon, author and social activist from Kerala, India.
Biography.
P. K. R. Warrier, the youngest son in his family, enrolled for medical studies at Madras Medical College during the early 1940s. As a student, he was actively involved in India's freedom struggle. It was during one of the freedom rallies in his student days that he met his future wife, Devaki Pallam, then an apprentice of Gandhi.
Having completed his undergraduate education at Madras Medical College in June 1946, he worked as a demonstrator of anatomy between July 1947 and December 1948. He remained in Madras training as an unofficial house surgeon and senior house surgeon under Dr. Mohan Rao and Dr. C.P.V. Menon at the General Hospital between January 1949 and June 1950. Between June 1950 and August 1959, he worked as a Civil Assistant Surgeon in various government hospitals throughout South India including Coimbatore, Cochin and Trivandrum as well as a brief stint in Minicoy Island.

Aurelia Browder

Aurelia Shines Browder Coleman (January 29, 1919 – February 4, 1971) was an African-American civil rights activist in Montgomery, Alabama. In April 1955, months before the historic arrest of Rosa Parks, she was arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white rider.
Biography.
Early Life and Family.
Aurelia Browder was born on January 29, 1919 in Montgomery, Alabama, where she resided her whole life. As a widowed mother of 6, she was responsible for supporting her family for several years. She had several different careers throughout her life including being a seamstress, nurse mid-wife and teacher. She was a strong, smart woman, one who Jo Ann Gibson Robinson described in her memoir as “well-read, highly intelligent, fearless.”
Education.
Browder completed high school in her thirties and eventually earned a bachelor’s degree in science from Alabama State University. She graduated with honors and was in the National Alpha Kappa Mu Honor Society there. While at Alabama State University, Browder met Jo Ann Gibson Robinson, a professor in the English Department, fellow Civil Rights activist, and member of the Women's Political Council. Robinson inspired Browder to get involved and tackle the injustices in the transportation system, encouraging her to participate in the lawsuit proposed by the Montgomery Improvement Association(MIA).
Involvement in Civil Rights.
Prior to her involvement in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Browder was active in the voter registration campaigns of the 1950s. She spent time tutoring African Americans who wanted to take the voter registration exam, worked to eliminate poll taxes, and provided transportation to the courthouse for those who wanted to register. Aurelia Browder became associated with several Civil Rights groups during her time including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).
Browder v. Gayle.
Arrest and Filing of Case.
Aurelia Browder was arrested on April 19, 1955, 7 months before the arrest of Rosa Parks, for sitting in the white section of a public city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. She was convicted and fined for her alleged crime. On February 1, 1956, Fred Gray (attorney for the Montgomery Improvement Association) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court of Montgomery on behalf of five black women who had been the victims of discrimination on local buses. W.A. Gayle, the Mayor of Montgomery, was the defendant. The Montgomery Improvement Association had its sights set on ending segregation and was fueled by the Montgomery Bus Boycott which was led primarily by Jo Ann Gibson Robinson. The boycott began on December 3, 1955, a few days after Rosa Parks’ arrest. The Montgomery Improvement Association filed Browder’s case because it would be able to skip being heard in the local courts. Rosa Park’s case would have had to go through local courts first, where the case might have stayed pending for years. By filing directly with the District Courts, they would also be able to achieve an injunction against the segregation law at the same time.
Plaintiffs.
Browder v. Gayle was filed listing five plaintiffs—Aurelia Browder, Susie McDonald, Jeanette Reese, Claudette Colvin and Mary Louise Smith. Browder was picked as the lead plaintiff because of her age. Two of the other plaintiffs were teenagers, and the other two were senior citizens. Browder was 45 at the time, putting her in the middle of the other plaintiffs and a good representation of all of them. Jeanette Reese withdrew from the case soon after it was filed because of intimidation from the white community.
Ruling and Aftermath.
On June 5, the judges released their decision—segregated buses violated the equal protection and due process guarantees of the 14th Amendment and were therefore unconstitutional. The City of Montgomery could not enforce any law “which may require plaintiffs or any other Negroes similarly situated to submit to segregation in the use of bus transportation facilities in the City of Montgomery.” Both the city and the state appealed this decision. On December 17, 1956, the Supreme Court upheld the ruling, issuing a court order to the state of Alabama to desegregate its buses. The Montgomery bus boycott ended on December 21, after 381 days.
Later life.
Browder continued to be an activist and involved with the NAACP, MIA and SCLC after her case was settled. She spent some time teaching veterans at the Loveless School and established her own business later in life. Browder’s son, Butler Browder, still lives in Montgomery. He feels that his mother’s legacy has been overshadowed. In a 2005 article in the Montgomery Advertiser, Butler wrote, “The truth is Browder vs. Gayle change the laws that mandated bus segregation. If it weren’t for that case and continued efforts to end segregation in this country, we might still be marching.”

Implant stability quotient

The Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) is a scale that indicates the level of stability and osseointegration in dental implants. The scale ranges from 1 to 100 and is measured by implant stability meters instruments using RFA (Resonance Frequency Analysis) technique. The acceptable stability range lies between 55-85 ISQ. Higher values are generally found in the mandible than the maxilla. High initial stability (ISQ values of 70 and above) tends to not increase with time, even if the high mechanical stability will decrease to be replaced by a developed biological stability. Lower initial stability will normally increase with time due to the lower mechanical stability being enforced by the bone remodeling process (osseointegration). The overall average ISQ value of all implants over time is approximately 70. If the initial ISQ value is high, a small drop in stability normally levels out with time. A significant decrease in ISQ indicates a potential problem and should be considered an early warning.

<doc id="20095716" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20095716" title="Würzburg Cathedral">
Würzburg Cathedral

Würzburg Cathedral () is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Würzburg in Bavaria, Germany, dedicated to Saint Kilian. It is the seat of the Bishop of Würzburg. With an overall length of 105 metres it is the fourth largest Romanesque church building in Germany, and a masterpiece of German architecture from the Salian period.
History.
The present cathedral, built from 1040 onwards by Bishop Bruno of Würzburg, reckoned to be the fourth largest Romanesque basilica in Germany, is the third church on the site: the previous two, built in about 787 and 855, were respectively destroyed and severely damaged by fire. After Bruno's accidental death in 1045, his successor Adalbero completed the building in 1075.
The side aisles were remodelled in about 1500 in the Late Gothic style. The stuccoist Pietro Magno decorated the cathedral in Baroque stucco work in 1701.
The greater part of the building collapsed in the winter of 1946 in consequence of the bombing of Würzburg on 16 March 1945. Reconstruction was completed in 1967, in the course of which the Baroque components were removed in favour of a re-Romanisation. The new interpretation emphasizes the contrast between the surviving historical parts of the structure, resulting in a sometimes controversial combination of predominantly Romanesque with modern and Baroque elements. The Neo-Romanesque west front with a rose window, the tripartite gallery and the opening for the clock were combined during the reconstruction with a plain pumice stone wall, and revealed again during renovation work up to November 2006. In 1988 the choir was redesigned by Hubert Elsässer.
Works of art.
The cathedral contains numerous works of art, of which the following are of especial note:
Organs.
The main organ was built in 1969 by the organ builders Klais. There is a second organ for the choir, and a third is planned for 2010.
Bells.
The cathedral today has 20 bells, with a total combined weight of 26 tons. The "Lobdeburg Bell", by Cunradus Citewar of Würzburg, the most prominent bellfounder of his time, dates from 1257, and, because it was taken down in 1933 and stored in the crypt, is the only ancient bell of the cathedral to have survived the firestorm caused by the bombing of 16 March 1945. It now hangs in the south-west tower and is rung every Friday at 3.00 p.m., to mark the hour of the death of Jesus Christ.
Würzburg Synod.
Between 1971 and 1975 the Würzburg Synod convened in the cathedral at the wish of Cardinal Döpfner, to determine the application of the Second Vatican Council to Germany.

The Horn is the most prominent peak on the Mount Buffalo plateau in Victoria, Australia. The Horn has an elevation of AHD.
Found on the west side of the Victorian Alps (part of the Australian Alps and the Great Dividing Range), the top of the mountain has granite boulders and rock formations.
A walking track leads to the top of The Horn.
History.
Aboriginal people made summer ascents to Mount Buffalo to gather and feast on the protein-rich Bogong Moth that cluster in rock crevices, and also to meet and hold ceremonies.
The Mount Buffalo plateau was named in 1824 by the explorers, Hume and Hovell, because of its supposed resemblance to a buffalo.

Description.
Very vigorous and rather unruly, maintaining a clean stem has proven difficult, effectively disqualifying 'Sapporo Gold' for street use, consequently it is now promoted primarily as a hedgerow tree. The foliage is similar to 'Sapporo Autumn Gold', which has the same parentage.
Pests and diseases.
'Sapporo Gold 2' (Resista) has a high resistance to Dutch elm disease.
Cultivation.
The tree was registered in 1990 as 'Sapporo Gold 2' (Resista) and has been marketed by André Briant Jeunes Plants [http://www.andre-briant.fr], Saint-Barthélemy-d'Anjou, as a hedging plant ever since.

Wang (musical)

Wang is a musical (the sheet music indicates "comic opera") with music by Woolson Morse and book and lyrics by J. Cheever Goodwin. It was first produced in New York in 1891 by DeWolf Hopper and his company and featured Della Fox. 
The show mixed comic opera material with burlesque and was set in Siam. The music does not have "Oriental" color, except for the title character's first entrance – on a "full scale imitation elephant" – and the wedding and coronation marches. The show was termed an "operatic burletta" because of the burlesque convention of having Fox wearing tights.
Production history.
"Wang" premiered at the now-demolished Broadway Theatre, New York City, on May 4, 1891 and closed on Oct 3, 1891 after 151 performances. The cast featured Helen Beresford as Nannette, Della Fox as Mataya, DeWolf Hopper as Wang, Samuel Reed as Colonel Fracasse, and Marion Singer as La Veuve Frimousse. 
The show was revived at the Lyric Theatre, running from April 18, 1904 through June 4, 1904, for 57 performances. The production was produced and directed by Sam S. Shubert and again starred Hopper and Singer, with Madge Lessing as Mataya.
Songs.
The songs in "Wang" (according to the published music, which varies from the song list shown at the Internet Broadway Database listing for the 1891 production) are:
The song "The Man with an Elephant on his Hands" was later adapted into an unlicensed and short-lived 1905 comic strip series by Everrett E. Lowry.

<doc id="20095824" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20095824" title="St. Werburgh's Church, Dublin">
St. Werburgh's Church, Dublin

St. Werburgh's Church is a Church of Ireland church in Dublin, Ireland, and was built in 1178, shortly after the arrival of the Anglo-Normans in the town, and named after St. Werburgh, abbess of Ely and patron saint of Chester who died in 699 AD. It is located in Werburgh Street, close to Dublin Castle.
The church.
In Celtic and Danish times, the parish was known as that of 
St. Martin of Tours, and his church stood near the south end of Werburgh Street. After St. Werburgh's Church was constructed it was much frequented by Bristol men, who were amongst the earliest settlers in Dublin. It contained chapels in honour of Our Lady, St. Martin and St. Catherine. 
The original church was burned down in 1300 (along with much of the city) and was rebuilt. From the time of Archbishop Henry de Loundres (died 1228), St. Werburgh's was appropriated to the Chancellor of St. Patrick's. By 1559 the nearby church of St. Mary del Dam on Dame Street was closed and its parish incorporated in that of St. Werburgh’s, which meant that St. Werburgh’s became the parish church of Dublin Castle. 
Primate James Ussher was appointed to this church in 1607, and Edward Wetenhall, afterwards Bishop of Kilmore, author of the well-known Greek and Latin Grammars, was curate here. Swift's friend, Dr. Patrick Delany (1685–1768), was rector of the parish in 1730.
During the 17th century conflicts erupted between the parish of St. Werburgh and that of nearby St. John the Evangelist (located in Fishamble Street) over parish boundaries. Each vestry wanted houses to levy rates on. The contested houses were in Copper Alley and those around Essex Gate and Essex Bridge.
The church needed replacement by the end of the seventeenth century. An act of 1715 which passed through the Irish Parliament appointed commissioners for building a new church. Colonel Thomas Burgh, M.P. for Naas, Surveyor-General for Public Buildings, was entrusted with the erection of the new structure. This was completed, so far as to admit of the celebration of divine service, in 1719, at a cost of £8,000. However, it was damaged by fire in 1754 and did not re-open until 1759. The present interior dates from this time, and was designed by John Smyth. 
In the eighteenth century St. Werburgh's came into vogue as the parish church of the British Lord Lieutenant and his entourage, where he had his own Viceregal pew inserted in 1767. In fact the pew register for this church lists many of the persons prominent in Dublin public life in this century. Around the same time John Smith (or Smyth) was the architect of an upper gallery for schoolchildren. The tower and spire were added the following year. The spire was removed around 1810 by the Castle authorities as a security measure, as it overlooked the Castle yard. They used as an excuse that the tower was unsafe (whereupon the architect Francis Johnston offered to make it safe, but was rejected); the tower was felled twenty-six years later.
The interior of the church was re-modeled in 1877 by the architect William Welland, when the parish was united with that of St. John the Evangelist.
In past times the area's fire engines were stored in the church porch and two examples can still be seen there today.
The parish.
The parish corresponds with the civil parish of the same name.
Notable parishioners.
John Field, composer and pianist was baptized in this church on 5 September 1782.

Carmen Campidoctoris

The Carmen Campidoctoris ("Song of the Campeador") is an anonymous medieval Latin epic poem, consisting in 128 sapphic-adonic verses in 32 stanzas, with one line from an unfinished thirty-third. The earliest poem about the Spanish folk hero El Cid Campeador, it was found in the monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll in the seventeenth century and was transferred to the Bibliothèque nationale de France, where it currently resides as manuscript lat. 5132. 
Content.
Subjectwise, the poem is a narrative of three of El Cid's victories: over an unknown Navarrese champion, over count García Ordóñez de Cabra, and finally over the Berenguer Ramon II, Count of Barcelona. The poem begins conventionally, with the poet confessing his unworthiness to sing of such a hero as El Cid, and moves quickly through his subject's youth, his early triumph over the champion from Navarre, and his loyal service to Sancho II of Castile and Alfonso VI of León. The anonymous poet blames the Cid's subsequent exile from court on certain enemies who turn the king against him. But the Cid is victorious over the army of García Ordóñez that Alfonso sent against him. The poet then describes, in great detail, a description of the Cid arming himself for battle against the Count of Barcelona, at Almenar near Lérida. The poem ends abruptly, obviously incomplete, before the battle. 
The description of the Cid's weapons, the earliest in the literature, contains references to chainmail, a silver-plated helm with a golden gem on it, a lance, an anonymous sword with golden ornamentation (which may be Tizona, based on the description), and a shield depicting a "fierce shining golden dragon" (which is the only surviving description of the Cid's shield). 
The "Carmen" also contains the earliest description of the Cid's ancestry, describing him as "Nobiliori de genere ortus / Quod in Castello non est illo maius": "He sprung from a more noble family, there is none older than it in Castile." R. A. Fletcher suggests this is a discreet way of saying that the Cid's ancestors were not among the most noble, just nobler than some.
Date and authorship.
The author of the "Carmen" was a good Latinist writing, to judge from his classical allusions, for a learned audience, probably at Ripoll. The hymn-like rhythm and rhyme strongly suggests that it was designed for public recitation. Scholars have dated the poem as early as 1083 (after the battle of Almenar in 1082) and as late as "c".1100. 
The motive of a Catalan monk in writing about a Castilian hero has been explained by the date of 1083 and the politics of Catalonia at that time. Since 1076 the brothers Berenguer Ramon II and Ramon Berenguer II had been trying to rule Catalonia jointly in accordance with their late father's wishes. This had proved unworkable and two divisions of the realm (1079 and 1080) had granted the Diocese of Vic, in which lay Ripoll, to Ramon Berenguer. The bishop of Vic, Berenguer Sunifred de Lluçà, was among Ramon's supporters. The "Carmen" was probably written by supporters of Ramon to celebrate his brother's defeat at the hands of the Cid, on the eve of civil war in Catalonia. 
The Late Latin title "campi doctor" or "campi doctus" (literally "teacher of the field"), rendered "campeador" in Castilian Romance, is first applied to the Cid by the anonymous author of the "Carmen", and it may be his literary invention. The library of Ripoll may have contained references to the obscure fourth- and fifth-century Roman military usage. It is not known how the term, which originally indicated a "regimental drill-instructor", came to currency in eleventh-century Spain, with a meaning like "armiger".

Fugue (hash function)

Fugue is a cryptographic hash function submitted by IBM to the NIST hash function competition. It was designed by Shai Halevi, William E. Hall, and Charanjit S. Jutla. Fugue takes an arbitrary-length message and compresses it down to a fixed bit-length (either 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits). The hash functions for the different output lengths are called Fugue-224, Fugue-256, Fugue-384 and Fugue-512. The authors also describe a parametrized version of Fugue. A weak version of Fugue-256 is also described using this parameterized version.
The selling point of Fugue is the authors' claimed proof that a wide range of current attack strategies based on differential cryptanalysis cannot be efficient against Fugue. It is also claimed to be competitive with the NIST hash function SHA-256 in both software and hardware efficiency, achieving up to 36.2 cycles per byte on an Intel Family 6 Model 15 Xeon 5150, and up to 25 cycles per byte on an Intel Core 2 processor T7700. On 45 nm Core2 processors, e.g. T9400, Fugue-256 runs at 16 cycles per byte using SSE4.1 instructions. On the newer Westmere architectures (32 nm), e.g. Core i5, Fugue-256 runs at 14 cycles/byte.
Fugue's design starts from the hash function Grindahl, and like Grindahl uses the S-box from AES, but it replaces the 4×4 column mixing matrix with a 16×16 "super-mix" operation which greatly improves diffusion. The "super-mix" operation is, however, only slightly more computationally expensive to implement than the AES mixing strategy.
SuperMix.
The 224 and 256 bit variants of Fugue work with a state which can be represented in 4 by 30 matrix of unsigned bytes, whereas the 384 and 512 bit variants work with a 4 by 36 byte matrix. Operations can be performed in-place on this state.
The core of the algorithm, known as the "SuperMix transformation", takes 4×4 matrix as input and returns a new 4x4 matrix. The input to SuperMix is simply the first four columns of the current 30-column state and the output is used to replace this same state area (i.e. SuperMix affects only the 4x4 matrix at the head of the state).
The SuperMix function can be defined as:
formula_1
where:
The transformation formula_5 takes a 4x4 matrix, and rotates the formula_6-th row to the left by formula_6 bytes, i.e.
Fugue 2.0.
Fugue 2.0 is a tweak of original Fugue, which runs at about twice the speed of Fugue for 256-bit output. The designers claim advanced proofs of resistance to differential collision attacks for this improved version.

Eight-vertex model

In statistical mechanics, the eight-vertex model is a generalisation of the ice-type (six-vertex) models; it was discussed by Sutherland, and Fan & Wu, and solved by Baxter in the zero-field case.
Description.
As with the ice-type models, the eight-vertex model is a square lattice model, where each state is a configuration of arrows at a vertex. The allowed vertices have an even number of arrows pointing towards the vertex; these include the six inherited from the ice-type model (1-6), and sinks and sources (7, 8).
We consider a formula_1 lattice, with formula_2 vertices and formula_3 edges. Imposing periodic boundary conditions requires that the states 7 and 8 occur equally often, as do states 5 and 6, and thus can be taken to have the same energy. For the zero-field case the same is true for the two other pairs of states. Each vertex formula_4 has an associated energy formula_5 and Boltzmann weight formula_6, giving the partition function over the lattice as
where the summation is over all allowed configurations of vertices in the lattice. In this general form the partition function remains unsolved.
Solution in the zero-field case.
The zero-field case of the model corresponds physically to the absence of external electric fields. Hence, the model remains unchanged under the reversal of all arrows; the states 1 and 2, and 3 and 4, consequently must occur as pairs. The vertices can be assigned arbitrary weights 
The solution is based on the observation that rows in transfer matrices commute, for a certain parametrisation of these four Boltzmann weights. This came about as a modification of an alternate solution for the six-vertex model; it makes use of elliptic theta functions.
Commuting transfer matrices.
The proof relies on the fact that when formula_9 and formula_10, for quantities 
the transfer matrices formula_12 and formula_13 (associated with the weights formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17 and formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_21) commute. Using the star-triangle relation, Baxter reformulated this condition as equivalent to a parametrisation of the weights given as
for fixed modulus formula_23 and formula_24 and variable formula_25. Here snh is the hyperbolic analogue of sn, given by
and formula_27 and formula_28 are Jacobi elliptic functions of modulus formula_23. The associated transfer matrix formula_30 thus is a function of formula_25 alone; for all formula_25, formula_33
The matrix function formula_35.
The other crucial part of the solution is the existence of a nonsingular matrix-valued function formula_36, such that for all complex formula_25 the matrices formula_38 commute with each other and the transfer matrices, and satisfy
where
The existence and commutation relations of such a function are demonstrated by considering pair propagations through a vertex, and periodicity relations of the theta functions, in a similar way to the six-vertex model.
Explicit solution.
The commutation of matrices in () allow them to be diagonalised, and thus eigenvalues can be found. The partition function is calculated from the maximal eigenvalue, resulting in a free energy per site of 
for
where formula_42 and formula_43 are the complete elliptic integrals of moduli formula_23 and formula_45.
The eight vertex model was also solved in quasicrystals.
Equivalence with an Ising model.
There is a natural correspondence between the eight-vertex model, and the Ising model with 2-spin and 4-spin nearest neighbour interactions. The states of this model are spins formula_46 on faces of a square lattice. The analogue of 'edges' in the eight-vertex model are products of spins on adjacent faces:
The most general form of the energy for this model is
where formula_49, formula_50, formula_51, formula_52 describe the horizontal, vertical and two diagonal 2-spin interactions, and formula_53 describes the 4-spin interaction between four faces at a vertex; the sum is over the whole lattice.
We denote horizontal and vertical spins (arrows on edges) in the eight-vertex model formula_54, formula_55 respectively, and define up and right as positive directions. The restriction on vertex states is that the product of four edges at a vertex is 1; this automatically holds for Ising 'edges'. Each formula_56 configuration then corresponds to a unique formula_54, formula_55 configuration, whereas each formula_54, formula_55 configuration gives two choices of formula_56 configurations. 
Equating general forms of Boltzmann weights for each vertex formula_4, the following relations between the formula_5 and formula_49, formula_50, formula_51, formula_52, formula_53 define the correspondence between the lattice models:
It follows that in the zero-field case of the eight-vertex model, the horizontal and vertical interactions in the corresponding Ising model vanish. 
These relations gives the equivalence formula_70 between the partition functions of the eight-vertex model, and the 2,4-spin Ising model. Consequently a solution in either model would lead immediately to a solution in the other.

They are based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States One of the goals of the organization is to promote barbecue related cultural events such as the "Tar Heel Barbecue Classic" and the "Lexington Barbecue Festival", as well as promote the barbecue culture of North Carolina.
Mission.
According the official website, "The mission of the North Carolina Barbecue Society (NCBS) is to preserve North Carolina’s barbecue history and culture and to secure North Carolina’s rightful place as the Barbecue Capital of the World." A less formal and more commonly heard motto is "to cook and eat barbecue as often as possible, preferably in the company of good friends and to promote the Old North State as the "Cradle of ’Cue"."
History.
The organization was founded in 2006. The president of the organization is founder Jim Early, attorney and author of the self-published book "The Best Tar Heel Barbecue: Manteo to Murphy", which is a review of all the restaurants on the "Historic Barbecue Trail", which links 25 barbecue establishments in 21 locales across the state.
Barbecue types and politics.
There are two native barbecue types in North Carolina, Eastern style and Lexington style, and great deal of controversy always surrounds any attempt to create an "official" barbecue type. They both use slow cooking over hardwood coals (usually hickory) but differ in methods. Two bills that would have introduced Lexington Style as the "defacto" barbecue type of the state met controversy and failure in the State House of Representatives and State Senate in 2006, "North Carolina House Bill 21" and "North Carolina Senate Bill 47".
Eastern style uses all of the meat from the pig (whole hog), or as it is more informally explained, it uses, '"every part of the hog except the squeal". The sauce can be as simple as vinegar and pepper.
Lexington style uses a vinegar and ketchup type sauce, and uses only the pork shoulder, which is darker meat, thus more moist. It is also served with red slaw, a type of coleslaw that uses this barbecue sauce (locally called "dip") instead of mayonnaise.
Sponsorship.
The organization is supported by member dues and by official sponsors. The majority of the official sponsors are barbecue restaurants in the region, which benefit directly from the efforts of the organization.

Ice-type model

In statistical mechanics, the ice-type models or six-vertex models are a family of vertex models for crystal lattices with hydrogen bonds. The first such model was introduced by Linus Pauling in 1935 to account for the residual entropy of water ice. Variants have been proposed as models of certain ferroelectric and antiferroelectric crystals.
In 1967, Elliott H. Lieb found the exact solution to a two-dimensional ice model known as "square ice". The exact solution in three dimensions is only known for a special "frozen" state.
Description.
An ice-type model is a lattice model defined on a lattice of coordination number 4 - that is, each vertex of the lattice is connected by an edge to four "nearest neighbours". A state of the model consists of an arrow on each edge of the lattice, such that the number of arrows pointing inwards at each vertex is 2. This restriction on the arrow configurations is known as the ice rule.
For two-dimensional models, the lattice is taken to be the square lattice. For more realistic models, one can use a three-dimensional lattice appropriate to the material being considered; for example, the hexagonal ice lattice is used to analyse ice.
At any vertex, there are six configurations of the arrows which satisfy the ice rule (justifying the name "six-vertex model"). The valid configurations for the (two-dimensional) square lattice are the following:
The energy of a state is understood to be a function of the configurations at each vertex. For square lattices, one assumes that the total energy formula_1 is given by
for some constants formula_3, where formula_4 here denotes the number of vertices with the formula_5th configuration from the above figure. The value formula_6 is the energy associated with vertex configuration number formula_5.
One aims to calculate the partition function formula_8 of an ice-type model, which is given by the formula
where the sum is taken over all states of the model, formula_1 is the energy of the state, formula_11 is Boltzmann's constant, and formula_12 is the system's temperature. 
Typically, one is interested in the thermodynamic limit in which the number formula_13 of vertices approaches infinity. In that case, one instead evaluates the free energy per vertex formula_14 in the limit as formula_15, where formula_14 is given by
Equivalently, one evaluates the partition function per vertex formula_18 in the thermodynamic limit, where
The values formula_14 and formula_18 are related by
Physical justification.
Several real crystals with hydrogen bonds satisfy the ice model, including ice and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP). Indeed, such crystals motivated the study of ice-type models.
In ice, each oxygen atom is connected by a bond to four other oxygens, and each bond contains one hydrogen atom between the terminal oxygens. The hydrogen occupies one of two symmetrically located positions, neither of which is in the middle of the bond. Pauling argued that the allowed configuration of hydrogen atoms is such that there are always exactly two hydrogens close to each oxygen, thus making the local environment imitate that of a water molecule, . Thus, if we take the oxygen atoms as the lattice vertices and the hydrogen bonds as the lattice edges, and if we draw an arrow on a bond which points to the side of the bond on which the hydrogen atom sits, then ice satisfies the ice model.
Similar reasoning applies to show that KDP also satisfies the ice model.
Specific choices of vertex energies.
On the square lattice, the energies formula_3 associated with vertex configurations 1-6 determine the relative probabilities of states, and thus can influence the macroscopic behaviour of the system. The following are common choices for these vertex energies.
The ice model.
When modelling ice, one takes formula_24, as all permissible vertex configurations are understood to be equally likely. In this case, the partition function formula_8 equals the total number of valid states. This model is known as the ice model (as opposed to an "ice-type" model).
The KDP model of a ferroelectric.
Slater argued that KDP could be represented by an ice-type model with energies
For this model (called the KDP model), the most likely state (the least-energy state) has all horizontal arrows pointing in the same direction, and likewise for all vertical arrows. Such a state is a ferroelectric state, in which all hydrogen atoms have a preference for one fixed side of their bonds.
Rys formula_27 model of an antiferroelectric.
The Rys formula_27 model is obtained by setting
The least-energy state for this model is dominated by vertex configurations 5 and 6. For such a state, adjacent horizontal bonds necessarily have arrows in opposite directions and similarly for vertical bonds, so this state is an antiferroelectric state.
The zero field assumption.
If there is no ambient electric field, then the total energy of a state should remain unchanged under a charge reversal, i.e. under flipping all arrows. Thus one may assume without loss of generality that
This assumption is known as the zero field assumption, and holds for the ice model, the KDP model, and the Rys F model.
History.
The ice rule was introduced by Linus Pauling in 1935 to account for the residual entropy of ice that had been measured by William F. Giauque and J. W. Stout. The residual entropy, formula_31, of ice is given by the formula
where formula_33 is Boltzmann's constant, formula_34 is the number of oxygen atoms in the piece of ice, which is always taken to be large (the thermodynamic limit) and formula_35 is the number of configurations of the hydrogen atoms according to Pauling's ice rule. Without the ice rule we would have formula_36 since the number of hydrogen atoms is formula_37 and each hydrogen has two possible locations. Pauling estimated that the ice rule reduces this to formula_38, a number that would agree extremely well with the Giauque-Stout measurement of formula_31. It can be said that Pauling's calculation of formula_31 for ice is one of the simplest, yet most accurate applications of statistical mechanics to real substances ever made. The question that remained was whether, given the model, Pauling's calculation of formula_41, which was very approximate, would be sustained by a rigorous calculation. This became a significant problem in combinatorics.
Both the three-dimensional and two-dimensional models were computed numerically by John F. Nagle in 1966 who found that formula_42 in three-dimensions and formula_43 in two-dimensions. Both are amazingly close to Pauling's rough calculation, 1.5.
In 1967, Lieb found the exact solution of three two-dimensional ice-type models: the ice model, the Rys formula_27 model, and the KDP model. The solution for the ice model gave the exact value of formula_41 in two-dimensions as
which is known as Lieb's square ice constant.
Later in 1967, Bill Sutherland generalised Lieb's solution of the three specific ice-type models to a general exact solution for square-lattice ice-type models satisfying the zero field assumption.
Still later in 1967, C. P. Yang generalised Sutherland's solution to an exact solution for square-lattice ice-type models in a horizontal electric field.
In 1969, John Nagle derived the exact solution for a three-dimensional version of the KDP model, for a specific range of temperatures. For such temperatures, the model is "frozen" in the sense that (in the thermodynamic limit) the energy per vertex and entropy per vertex are both zero. This is the only known exact solution for a three-dimensional ice-type model.
Relation to eight-vertex model.
The eight-vertex model, which has also been exactly solved, is a generalisation of the (square-lattice) six-vertex model: to recover the six-vertex model from the eight-vertex model, set the energies for vertex configurations 7 and 8 to infinity. Six-vertex models have been solved in some cases for which the eight-vertex model has not; for example, Nagle's solution for the three-dimensional KDP model and Yang's solution of the six-vertex model in a horizontal field.
Boundary conditions.
This ice model provide an important 'counterexample' in statistical mechanics:
the bulk free energy in the thermodynamic limit depends on boundary conditions. The model was analytically solved for periodic boundary conditions, anti-periodic,
ferromagnetic and domain wall boundary conditions. Six vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions on a square lattice has specific significance for algebraic combinatorics, it helps to enumerate Alternating sign matrix.
In this case the partition function can be represented as a determinant of a matrix (dimension of the matrix is equal to the size of the lattice), but in the other cases the enumeration of 
formula_18 does not come out in such a simple closed form.
Domain wall gives the smallest formula_18 . Clearly, the largest formula_18 
is given by "free" boundary conditions (no constraint at all on the configurations on the boundary), but the same formula_18 occurs, in the thermodynamic limit, for periodic boundary conditions, as used originally to derive formula_51.
3-colorings of a lattice.
The number of states of an ice type model on the internal edges of a finite simply connected union of squares of a lattice is equal to one third of the number of ways to 3-color the squares, with no two adjacent squares having the same color. This correspondence between states is due to Andrew Lenard and is given as follows. If a square has color "i" = 0, 1, or 2, then the arrow
on the edge to an adjacent square goes left or right (according to an observer in the square) depending on whether the color in the adjacent square is "i"+1 or "i"−1 mod 3. There are 3 possible ways to color a fixed initial square, and once this initial color is chosen this gives a 1:1 correspondence between colorings and arrangements of arrows satisfying the ice-type condition.

Brahmananda Keshab Chandra College

Brahmananda Keshab Chandra College, established in 1956, is an undergraduate college in Kolkata, west Bengal, India. It was named after the nineteenth century social reformer Keshab Chandra Sen. Popularly known as B.K.C. College, the institution was established with the aim of filling a vacuum in higher education in North 24 Parganas. The college has an aim of providing not just education but also a sense of social responsibility among its students.
History of the college.
In 1954, professor J. C. Ghosh, the then vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta, surveyed the available higher educational facilities in North 24 Parganas. The survey revealed that facilities were inadequate given the huge influx of refugees in the area. His suggested solution called for ten new colleges in the area, covering both male and female students and the study of both humanities and sciences, and funded by the Central Relief and Rehabilitation Ministry, Government of India. This plan was accepted and Brahmananda Keshab Chandra College was thus established in 1956 as one of the colleges under this scheme. Initially the college was housed at Sagar Dutta Free High School, Kamarhati, but later moved to its own premises in 1957.
Until 2008, the college was affiliated to the University of Calcutta. It is now affiliated with the West Bengal State University
Courses.
BKC College offers honours courses in the following subjects:-
Courses are also offered in 
Library and laboratories.
The college library has a collection of about thirty thousand books. The college also subscribes to a number of journals and periodicals which are on display in the library. The computerization of the library is underway. Departments of the college also provide the facility of borrowing books for the students through department libraries. The College is provided with well-equipped laboratories which are designed to meet the need of science students for their practical courses

<doc id="20096058" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20096058" title="Orwell's list">
Orwell's list

Orwell's list, prepared in 1949 by the English author George Orwell, shortly before he died, comprises names of notable writers and other persons he considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the Information Research Department's anti-communist propaganda activities.
Background.
The Information Research Department was a propaganda unit set up by the Labour government in 1948 based at the United Kingdom's Foreign Office, after the start of the Cold War.
Celia Kirwan, who had just started working as Robert Conquest's assistant at the IRD, visited Orwell at a sanatorium where he was being treated for tuberculosis in March 1949. Orwell wrote down the names of persons he considered sympathetic to communism and therefore unsuitable as writers for the Department, and enclosed it in a letter to Kirwan. The list became public in 2003.
Having previously worked for Cyril Connolly's "Horizon" magazine,
and briefly as an editorial assistant for Humphrey Slater's "Polemic", Kirwan was Arthur Koestler's sister-in-law and one of the four women to whom Orwell proposed after the death of his wife Eileen O'Shaughnessy in 1945. Although Koestler had supported such a match, Kirwan turned him down.
Notebook.
Orwell based his list on a strictly private notebook he had maintained since the mid-1940s of possible "cryptos", "F.T." (his abbreviation for fellow travellers), outright members of the CP, agents and sentimental sympathizers. The notebook, now at the Orwell Archive at University College London, contains 135 names in all, including US writers and politicians. Ten names had been crossed out, either because the person had died or because Orwell had decided that they were neither crypto-communists nor fellow travellers. The people named were a mélange: "some famous, some obscure, some he knew personally and others he did not." Orwell commented in "New Leader" in 1947:
The important thing to do with these people – and it is extremely difficult, since one has only inferential evidence – is to sort them out and determine which of them is honest and which is not. There is, for instance, a whole group of M. P.s in the British Parliament (Pritt, Zilliacus, etc.) who are commonly nicknamed 'the cryptos'. They have undoubtedly done a great deal of mischief, especially in confusing public opinion about the nature of the puppet regimes in Eastern Europe; but one ought not hurriedly to assume that they all hold the same opinions. Probably some of them are actuated by nothing worse than stupidity.
The notebook contained columns with names, comments and various markings. Typical comments were Stephen Spender “Sentimental sympathiser... Tendency towards homosexuality”, Richard Crossman “Too dishonest to be outright F. T.”, Kingsley Martin "Decayed liberal. Very dishonest" and Paul Robeson "very anti-white.
Richard Rees discussed the names with Orwell, later commenting that it was "a sort of game we played – discussing who was a paid agent of what and estimating to what lengths of treachery our favourite bêtes noires would be prepared to go." Orwell asked Rees to fetch the notebook from Jura in early 1949, thanking him in a letter of 17 April.
One of Orwell's biographers, Bernard Crick, thought there were 86 names in the list and that some of the names were written in the hand of Koestler, who also co-operated with the IRD in producing anti-Communist propaganda.
Orwell was an ex-colonial policeman in Burma and according to Garton Ash, he liked making lists: 'In a "London Letter" to "Partisan Review" in 1942 he wrote, "I think I could make out at least a preliminary list of the people who would go over" to the Nazi side if the Germans occupied England."'
Reactions to the IRD List.
The British press had known about the list for some years before it was officially made public in 2003, and reactions included the following headline in the "Daily Telegraph" when "breaking" the story in 1998:
People like Michael Foot, the former leader of the Labour Party and a friend of Orwell's in the 1930s and 1940s, were "amazed" by the revelation. Richard Gott, who in 1994 had resigned as literary editor of "The Guardian" after admitting that he had accepted travel expenses from the KGB, in an unrelated case, referred to Orwell's list as only a "small surprise".
Norman Mackenzie noted "Tubercular people often could get very strange towards the end. I'm an Orwell man, I agreed with him on the Soviet Union, but he went partly ga-ga I think. He let his dislike of the "New Statesman" crowd, of what he saw as leftish, dilettante, sentimental socialists
who covered up for the Popular Front in Spain it became communist-controlled get the better of him."
Bernard Crick justified Orwell wanting to help the post-war Labour Government. "He did it because he thought the Communist Party was a totalitarian menace," he said. "He wasn't denouncing these people as subversives. He was denouncing them as unsuitable for a counter-intelligence operation."
Professor Peter Davison, editor of Orwell's "Complete Works", said the really disappointed people will be those who claimed to have been on the list but were not.
John Newsinger considered it "a terrible mistake on his part, deriving in equal measure from his hostility to Stalinism and his illusions in the Labour government. What it certainly does not amount to, however, is an abandonment of the socialist cause or transformation into a footsoldier in the Cold War. Indeed, Orwell made clear on a number of occasions his opposition to any British McCarthyism, to any bans and proscriptions on Communist Party members (they certainly did not reciprocate this) and any notion of a preventive war. If he had lived long enough to realise what the IRD was actually about there can be no doubt that he would have broken with it".
Neal Ascherson was critical of Orwell's decision to give the information to the IRD, claiming "there is a difference between being determined to expose the stupidity of Stalinism and the scale of the purges and throwing yourself into the business of denouncing people you know." Paul Foot said the revelations would not detract from Orwell's reputation as a great writer, noting " I am a great admirer of Orwell, but we have to accept that he did take a McCarthyite position towards the end of
his life."
Alexander Cockburn was strongly critical of Orwell's actions, referring to the notebook as "a snitch list". Cockburn
attacked Orwell's description of Paul Robeson as "anti-white", pointing out Robeson had campaigned to help Welsh
coal miners. Cockburn also claimed the list revealed Orwell as a bigot: "There seems to be general agreement by Orwell's fans, left and right, to skate gently over Orwell's suspicions of Jews, homosexuals and blacks". 
Celia Kirwan insisted:I think George was quite right to do it. ... And, of course, everybody thinks that these people were going to be shot at dawn. The only thing that was going to happen to them was that they wouldn't be asked to write for the Information Research Department.

Sources vary as to the actual number of names on the list (figures range from 35 to 38). Names on the list include the following:

St Catherine's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)

St. Catherine's Church, on Thomas Street, in Dublin, Ireland, was originally built in 1185. It is located on what was once termed the ""Slí Mhór"" (Irish: Great Way) - a key route that ran westwards across Ireland from Dublin. The church was rebuilt in its present form in the 18th century by John Smyth (or Smith).
The church closed in 1966 due to a decrease in the local population. The church was de-consecrated the following year, and for a period was used by Dublin Corporation for exhibitions and concerts. After a period of decline, and later of refurbishment, St. Catherine's was re-consecrated and has been the place of worship for the Anglican "CORE" church (City Outreach for Renewal and Evangelism) since then.
History.
Parish history.
In 1177 the parish of St. James is mentioned as part of the abbey of St. Thomas (from which Thomas Street got its name), and the church of St. Catherine was a chapel-of-ease to the abbey. By the end of the 13th century the western suburbs had so increased in population that a separate parish was deemed necessary, which was provided for by splitting the parish of St. James and setting up an independent parish for St. Catherine's.
Both parishes were still subservient to the Abbey of St. Thomas, but in 1539 the abbey was dissolved with all the monasteries by Henry VIII. In the surrender made by Henry Duffe, last Abbot, were included "the Churches of St. Catherine and St. James near Dublin." Both churches, now independent, had new curates appointed by the crown: Sir John Brace to St. Catherine's (which was shortly taken over by Peter Ledwich (or Ledwidge)) and Sir John Butler to St. James. Over the following hundred years both churches passed over to the reformed church, while Roman Catholic priests led a precarious existence tending to the larger part of the population, which remained faithful to the old religion.
The parish of St. Catherine appears to have been the only viable one in the area at that time - Roman Catholics eventually got the use of a chapel in Dirty Lane (now Bridgefoot Street) towards the end of the 17th century. Later, another St. Catherine's was founded in Meath Street to cater for the Catholic population.
The two Church of Ireland parishes were separated in 1710.
Building history.
The building that stands now was originally built between 1760 and 1769 to the designs of the architect John Smyth (who was also responsible for the interior of St Werburgh's Church, among other works in Dublin at the time).
In 1803 the church was the site of Robert Emmet's execution - and a plaque commemorating this remains today.
Into the 20th century, the Protestant population of the Liberties area of the city declined, and the church closed in September 1966. It was de-consecrated the following year.
St. Catherine's was transferred for a number of years to Dublin Corporation, and was used for exhibitions and concerts - hosting artists such as Christy Moore and The Chieftains. It fell disused in the 1980s however, and the interior was vandalised.
In 1990 Dublin Corporation offered the church for sale as part of an inner city development plan. An Anglican group (City Outreach for Renewal and Evangelism - CORE) took on the refurbishment of the church in 1993, and the interior was largely restored by the end of 1998. In early November 1998 St. Catherine's was reconsecrated and has been an active place of worship since then.
Church architecture.
A noted authority on Dublin architecture, Maurice Craig, wrote that St. Catherine's has "the finest façade of any church in Dublin". Its façade is built of mountain granite and has in the centre four Doric semi-columns supporting a pediment, and at the extremities coupled pilasters. Originally a spire was intended, but this was not completed - due to lack of funds.
Internally, St. Catherine's is a galleried church (a type common in Dublin from the late 17th century) Architects Curdy and Mitchell restored the church in 1877 and during the following decade an interior reordering was undertaken by architect James Franklin Fuller, during which the old box pews were replaced with open ones.
The crypt contains the remains of several Earls of Meath. Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall, fatally wounded at the Battle of Rathmines, was buried in St Catherine's in August 1649.
Cemetery.
The churchyard and cemetery lies to the rear of St. Catherine's. Originally dating to 1552, burials ceased in 1894. The cemetery is now a small public park.

Florida National Bank

Florida National Bank (FNB), founded in 1905, grew to became the second largest commercial bank in Florida. Florida National Group was acquired in 1990 by First Union Corporation, which was renamed Wachovia in 2001.
History.
Early years.
Samuel Hubbard's Mercantile Exchange Bank eventually became Florida National Bank after Jacksonville's Great Fire of 1901. Millionaire Alfred I. du Pont acquired a major interest in the FNB shortly after moving to Jacksonville in the mid-1920s, but he was unable to gain control until the Great Depression struck in 1929. The FNB stayed solvent throughout the 1930s because du Pont put $15 million of his own money into the institution to cover Bank runs. During the early 1930s, six other Florida National Banks were opened throughout Florida, including Lakeland and Bartow; Alfred's wife, Jessie Ball du Pont was named a director of the bank. When Alfred du Pont died in 1935, the du Pont Trust, managed by Ed Ball, Jessie du Pont's brother, continued to control the bank. Growth continued with the acquisition of many more Florida banks over the next two decades and became known as the "Florida National Group", which was one of the strongest banks in the state. In size, the branches eventually numbered 185, second only in Florida to Barnett Bank. 
Ball built the Florida National Bank building at 214 North Hogan Street in Jacksonville in 1961. The structure was constructed using materials which would appreciate in value, such as marble floors and granite exteriors, but excluded items that Ball considered frills. There were no executive washrooms and no hot water faucets in the entire eleven story edifice. The corporate offices of the group were housed in the upper floors and the bank's principal location was on the ground floor. Ed Ball also kept his personal office there for managing the du Pont Trust. After Ball's death, the structure was renamed the "Edward Ball Building".
Congress forced the du Pont Trust to divest itself of banking interests when they withdrew the trust's 15-year exemption from the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The trust sold 34.7% ownership in Florida National Banks to Charter Company in 1971 for $42M, leaving the du Pont Trust with 24.9%, below the legal definition of a bank holding company. The CEO of Charter was Raymond Mason, a protégé of Ed Ball. Additionally, Ed Ball personally owned 6.4% of FNB and was executor of his sister's estate, which owned 4.5% of FNB. 
On July 9, 1973, the Federal Reserve Board issued a preliminary determination that the du Pont Trust had retained enough stock that would allow the trust to continue to exert some control over the bank. Ball was forced to sell the trust's remaining shares and resign as chairman of FNB. However, the du Pont Trust owned a significant block of Charter stock, and the close personal relationship between Mason and Ball still allowed some indirect control.
Acquisition.
Southeast Banking Corporation (SBC), Florida's largest bank holding company, targeted FNB with a takeover bid in 1980, which the FNB board rejected. That same year, a group of foreign investors from Chile, Venezuela, Canada and south Florida sought 40% ownership and control of FNB. FNB filed suit in circuit court and the group was enjoined from acquiring more than 25% of the bank holding company's outstanding shares. However, Florida National revealed in 1981 that it was willing to permit acquisition by Chemical Banking Corporation of New York after laws preventing interstate banking were lifted. At the same time, C.A. Cavendes Sociedad Financiera, a Venezuelan investment company, announced that it had acquired 24.99 percent of the common stock of Florida National. 
In February, 1982, SBC sued to obtain an injunction against the merger in Federal court, citing contrary banking laws in both Federal and Florida codes. Florida National Bank countered with an antitrust suit against SBC. It was FNB's contention that if SBC were allowed to complete the takeover, commercial banking competition would be unlawfully reduced. 
In early 1983, Southeast Banking Corporation dropped its takeover attempt and agreed to exchange their 1.73 million FNB shares for 24 FNB branch offices, $5.7M in cash, a downtown Miami real estate parcel and other assets. This was during the time when Charter was going through a bankruptcy. The Federal Reserve Board approved a revised merger plan between FNB and Chemical Bank in 1984. However, at the time, interstate banking acquisitions were prohibited by Federal law and required state legislative approval. With the 1990 deadline running out for its option to buy FNB and no sign of state legislative approval, Chemical Bank sold their 4.9% interest to First Union for $115 million. On March 7, 1989, it was revealed that Florida National Banks was to be acquired by Charlotte, North Carolina's First Union Corporation. The transaction, valued at $849 million, was consummated the following year.

The Riegelmann Boardwalk, named for Edward J. Riegelmann but known by many as simply as the Coney Island Boardwalk, is located along the southern shore of the Coney Island peninsula in Brooklyn, New York City, adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean. 
The boardwalk, built in 1923, stretches for 2.51 miles from West 37th Street at the border of Coney Island and Sea Gate to Brighton 14th Street in Brighton Beach.
Many of its most famous amusement parks no longer exist, but the boardwalk still hosts the Coney Island Cyclone roller coaster and the Wonder Wheel Ferris wheel, as well as the New York Aquarium. The more recent MCU Park is home of the minor-league Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.
The Riegelmann Boardwalk has a steel and concrete foundation supporting wood planking for the walkway. Restroom facilities, benches and waterfountains are located along its length.

Finnish science fiction fandom

Finnish science fiction fandom started getting organized in Finland when the first science fiction club (the Turku Science Fiction Society) was founded in Turku in 1976. The first fan conventions were in 1982 and 1985. The Finnish national convention, Finncon, was established in 1986. One of the main actors to start an active fan culture in Finland was Tom Ölander.

Master of Business and Management

A Masters in Business and Management (MBM) is a general category of "master in business" or "master in management" degrees, usually pursued by students immediately after completing a bachelor's degree (which distinguishes the MBM from the post-experience MBA degree that usually requires at least 3 years of work experience). Common MBM variations include MSc Management and MSc International Management.
The MBM is open to graduates in all fields of the humanities, arts, engineering, science and business. It is designed to equip students with generalist managerial and leadership skills that will improve their practice and help them start a successful career in business management. The curriculum is therefore often very similar to that of an MBA, though the teaching and learning styles may be different in order to account for the variations in prior work experience.
The Association of MBAs has been accrediting MBM degrees since 2005 and has accredited over 40 programs at international business schools.

Toufic H. Kalil House

The Toufic H. Kalil House is a structure built by Frank Lloyd Wright in Manchester, New Hampshire, in 1955. The Usonian Automatic design of this house allowed Wright to meet the requirements of Dr. Toufic and Mildred Kalil, a professional couple. Wright used the term Usonian Automatic to describe the design of economical Usonian style houses constructed of modular concrete blocks. This house illustrates Wright's creative use of this inexpensive material.
Typical of Wright's Usonian style, the Kalil house draws its beauty from simple, linear forms rather than ornamental details. Symmetrical rows of rectangular window openings give the heavy concrete a sense of airiness.
The Kalil house was designed in the mid-1950s, near the end of Wright's life. The Zimmerman House was built in a very different Usonian style for Dr. Toufic Kalil's good friend and hospital colleague, Dr. Zimmerman, three lots down, on the same street, five years earlier.
This house contains a living room, kitchen, two bedrooms, two baths and a study. All of the original furniture, most of which is built-in, is still intact. The house is privately owned and not open to tours.

Edmund Broughton Barnard

Edmund Broughton Barnard (16 February 1856 – 27 January 1930) was a British Liberal politician, landowner and sportsman.
Family and education.
Barnard was the son of William Barnard who had connections to Harlow Mill in Essex and the nearby Sawbridgeworth in Hertfordshire. He was educated at Brighton College and Downing College, Cambridge where he gained his BA in 1879 and MA in 1882. He was a member of the Agricultural Board of Studies of Cambridge University. He married Alice Maude Richardson in 1887. His wife died in 1907.
Career.
Barnard was an old-fashioned country gentleman, a patron of his locality on the Essex and Hertfordshire borders where his family had been extensive landowners and farmers for generations. He was a generous local benefactor and supporter of good causes.
Local politics.
Barnard was an original member of Hertfordshire County Council, serving on and chairing many different committees and becoming its chairman in 1920 and an Alderman. He was chairman of the County Council’s Education Committee and took a strong stand in favour of the retention of village schools, emphasising their importance to the preservation of village life. Barnard also served on Sawbridgeworth Urban District Council and was its chairman between 1905 and 1907 
Parliamentary politics.
He stood unsuccessfully for Parliament three times before getting elected. At the 1885 general election he was Liberal candidate in Epping; in 1886 he stood in Maldon and then in Kidderminster at the general election of 1900. After nursing the constituency for the next few years, he was finally elected at Kidderminster in the Liberal landslide victory of 1906 where his Conservative opponent was the future prime minister Stanley Baldwin. He did not contest Kidderminster in the general elections of January 1910 but fought the December General Election and came close to winning back his old seat. He seemed to have had a falling out with the Liberals over the prosecution of the First World War and the conduct of party politics in general as in 1917 he fought a by-election at Islington East for the National Party. He fought the 1918 general election for the same party at Hertford.
Other public appointments.
In 1904 Barnard was elected Chairman of the Metropolitan Water Board. He was sometime Chairman of the Lee Conservancy Board and the Thames Conservancy Board. In connection with this work he was appointed the First Employers’ Chairman of the Joint Industrial Council for the Waterworks Undertakings Industry. He was sometime president of the Canal Association of Great Britain. He was a Justice of the Peace for both Essex and Hertfordshire and Chairman of Bishops Stortford Petty Sessions. Barnard was also sometime chairman of the Hertfordshire Agricultural Executive, chairman of the Board of Governors of The Bishops Stortford Secondary School for Girls. He was also a Deputy Lieutenant of Hertfordshire.
Honours.
He was awarded the OBE and was knighted in January 1928.
Sportsman.
Barnard was an accomplished horseman. He played polo for Cambridge and rode in competitions under Jockey Club Rules, on one occasion riding three winners in an afternoon at Lewes races. He later took to regular attendance at race meetings and combined this with a reputation for being a pleasure seeker and convivial host at his Sawbridgeworth home.
Death.
Barnard died suddenly during a meeting of the Hertfordshire County Council which he was chairing on 27 January 1930. The meeting was being held in London in the Law Society’s Hall. Apparently Barnard was just about to move a resolution when he experienced a sudden seizure. The county medical officer went to his assistance but he had died almost instantly.

Center for the History of Family Medicine

The Center for the History of Family Medicine (CHFM) is a historical research center which is part of the non-profit American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation (AAFP Foundation), a non-profit, charitable 501(c)(3) organization located in Leawood, Kansas. The Center for the History of Family Medicine (CHFM) serves as the primary repository of information and resources on the history and evolution of general practice, family practice, the discipline of family medicine and the family medicine organizations within the United States. Its mission is to document, organize and preserve organizational records, personal papers, books and artifacts in all formats and disseminate information about them in both printed and electronic form. It also serves as an informational link to all other family medicine organizations and to all who are interested in the history of the specialty.
History & Background.
The first move to begin an historical center within the specialty of family medicine came in 1987, when Claudene Clinton, then Director of the Division of Research and Information Services for the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), suggested the need for the establishment of a repository within the AAFP to house the growing body of material relating to the founding, growth and development of both the Academy and the specialty of family medicine. At its meeting in February of that year, the Board of Directors of the Academy moved to establish “a task force on the history of the American Academy of Family Physicians to determine the best way to preserve materials and documents related to the growth of the specialty.” A consultant was obtained, and after lengthy study in which detailed space, equipment and budgetary requirements were determined, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of an “AAFP Archives” within the Academy. Following her retirement as Director of the Division of Research and Information Services, Ms. Clinton served as the first Archivist for the Archives (later renamed “The Archives for Family Practice”) on a contract basis with the Academy.
On January 1, 1992, administrative responsibility for the Archives was transferred from the Academy to the AAFP Foundation. Following its transfer to the Foundation, a Board of Curators was created to serve in an advisory capacity to the Foundation’s Board of Trustees on the operations of the Archives. Initially the Board was made up of 7 members (now 15) “who have made significant contributions to family practice; who possess a broad perspective of the discipline; who have a strong interest in its historical development; and who are familiar with all the organizations in the discipline.” In 1998, an endowment was also created for the Center, to help realize the Board of Curator’s vision of a “self-sustaining and self-supporting” entity operating within the Foundation.
By 2003, the Archives for Family Practice had evolved into the principal resource center for the collection, conservation, exhibition and study of materials relating to the history of family medicine. Besides the Academy and the Foundation, other family medicine organizations that contribute by placing their records into its holdings, donating to its endowment and having their members serve on its advisory board include the American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM); the Association of Departments of Family Medicine (ADFM); the Association of Family Medicine Residency Directors (AFMRD); the North American Primary Care Research Group (NAPCRG); and the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine (STFM). The collections had also evolved, growing into four separate and distinct areas:
This rapid expansion of the Archives for Family Practice’s collections, coupled with some confusion generated by its name (which was similar to several medicine journals bearing the title “Archives”), gave rise to the need for a name change for the Archives. Consequently, in November 2003, the Board of Curators and the AAFP/F Board of Trustees approved a new name for the facility, and on January 1, 2004, the Archives for Family Practice officially became the Center for the History of Family Medicine.
The Center for the History of Family Medicine is presently the only institution dedicated exclusively to preserving and sharing the history of family medicine in the United States. It serves to document all aspects of the profession in all of its spheres, including education, leadership development, advocacy, and in the continuing care of patients from birth to death.
Collections, Programs & Exhibits.
An interdisciplinary study center consisting of an historical research library, archives and museum center, the CHFM actively documents, collects, organizes, preserves and exhibits organizational records, personal papers, books, artifacts and other materials in all formats relating to the history of general practice, family practice and family medicine in America. The Center’s programs include an active acquisitions and oral history program in which personal and professional papers and oral histories are collected from prominent leaders in the specialty, and a traveling exhibit program. Reference services are also provided.

AI-5

The Ato Institucional Número Cinco – AI-5 () was the fifth of seventeen major decrees issued by the military dictatorship in the years following the 1964 coup d'état in Brazil. "Institutional Acts" were the highest form of legislation during the military regime, given that, issued on behalf of the "Supreme Command of the Revolution" (the regime's leadership) they overruled even the Nation's Constitution, and were enforced without the possibility of judicial review.
AI-5, the most infamous of all Institutional Acts, was issued by President Artur da Costa e Silva on December 13, 1968.
Written by then Minister of Justice, Luís Antônio da Gama e Silva, it came as a response to earlier events such as a march of over fifty thousand people in Rio de Janeiro to protest against the murder of student Edson Luís de Lima Souto by a member of the Military Police of Rio de Janeiro, the March of the Hundred Thousand, and the decision of the Chamber of Deputies denying authorization to prosecute Congressman Márcio Moreira Alves, which called Brazilians to boycott the celebrations of September 7 (Independence of Brazil). It also aimed to consolidate the ambitions of a group inside the military, known as "hardline", unwilling to give the power back to the civilians anytime soon.
Consequences.
The immediate consequences of the Institutional Act Number Five were: 
Rebel ARENA.
The AI-5 did not silence a group of Senators from ARENA, the political party created to give support for the dictatorship. Under the leadership of Daniel Krieger, the following Senators signed a disagreement message addressed to the president: Gilberto Marinho, Miltom Campos, Carvalho Pinto, Eurico Resende, Manoel Villaça, Wilson Gonçalves, Aloisio de Carvalho Filho, Antonio Carlos Konder Reis, Ney Braga, Mem de Sá, Rui Palmeira, Teotônio Vilela, José Cândido Ferraz, Leandro Maciel, Vitorino Freire, Arnon de Melo, Clodomir Milet, José Guiomard, Valdemar Alcântara e Júlio Leite.
The end of AI-5.
In 1978, President Ernesto Geisel allowed Congress to pass a constitutional amendment putting an end to AI-5 and restoring habeas corpus, as part of his policy of "distensão" (détente).
In 2004, the celebrated television documentary titled "AI-5 – O Dia Que Não Existiu" ("AI-5 – The Day That Never Existed"), was released. The documentary analyzes the events prior to the decree and its consequences.

Extinction (Bernhard novel)

Extinction is the last of Thomas Bernhard’s novels. It was originally published in German in 1986.
Plot summary.
"Extinction" takes the form of the autobiographical testimony of Franz-Josef Murau, the intellectual black sheep of a powerful Austrian land-owning family. Murau lives in Rome in self-exile, obsessed and angry with his identity as an Austrian, and resolves never to return to the family estate of Wolfsegg. He is surrounded by a group of artistic and intellectual friends, and intends to continue living what he calls the "Italianate way". When he hears of his parents' deaths, he finds himself master of Wolfsegg and must decide its fate. 
Murau has cut himself off from his family and sought to establish an intellectual life as a tutor in Rome. In the first half of the novel, he reflects on the spiritual, intellectual, and moral impoverishment of his family to his Roman student Gambetti. He only has respect for his Uncle Georg, who similarly cut himself off from the family and helped Murau to save himself. In the second section, he returns to his family’s estate, Wolfsegg, for the funeral, as well as to determine the disposal of the estate, which is now in his hands.
Throughout the novel, Murau talks about the void that he has created for himself via exaggeration combined with understatement. Murau then incriminates all of art in this role of unjustified absolution. To Gambetti, the "great" of "great art" was just that; when he thinks on his villa in Wolfsegg, "great" comes to mean something new: criminal art that has the power to make people pardon themselves for mortal sins.
Gambetti is Murau’s collaborator. His presence provides the mirror to the society of his parents, and reveals that Murau too has established an audience for himself that unknowingly endorses his obscure tactics. He stops speaking to Gambetti in the second half of the novel because Gambetti has been an agent in Murau’s self-deception. This in turn allows Murau to write his "Extinction".
Imagery, style and themes.
In this last of his novels, Bernhard uses repetition to achieve a cathartic effect while delivering himself of a parthian shot at the very language without which his own literary achievements would have been inconceivable. 
Although not his very last novel, "Extinction" is the last book published whilst Bernhard was still living, and for this reason it may be read as a sort of last poetic testament.
There’s something utopian in this novel, underscored by the ending, where Wolfsegg’s entire estate is donated to the Jewish community of Vienna. It’s a radical and destructive utopia, a utopia that annihilates Murau himself, and which is at any rate overwhelmed by resentment and hate for his birthplace. But Bernhard wouldn’t be Bernhard if such a denigration, so relentless and ruthless, didn’t mutate in a vertiginous cascade of words with compulsive musical pitches of extraordinary beauty (and beautifully rendered by translator David McLintock) – a melodic "aria" whose lightness sharply contrasts with the gloomy character of Murau’s proclamations. It’s this very rhythm – an inexorable, spiralling mechanism of hyperboles and superlatives – which confers to the narrative the specific "vis comica" so characteristic of Bernhard’s work. Exaggeration changes into grotesque, tragedy into comedy. And often within the text, one hears a long liberating laughter. "Everything is ridiculous when one thinks of death," Bernhard wrote, and very few other contemporary authors have demonstrated how thin the line is that separates the tragic from the comic.
Excerpts.

William Schaffner

Captain William Schaffner (born September 11, 1941 - September 8, 1970) was a pilot in the United States Air Force. He died in an incident in 1970 over the North Sea. Although unsubstantiated and in conflict with the official reports, UFO enthusiasts claim the incident was the result of contact with a UFO.
September 1970 incident.
In September 1970, Captain Schaffner was an American exchange pilot flying BAC Lightnings with the RAF at RAF Binbrook in north-east Lincolnshire, England. Binbrook was one of the bases, along with RAF Coningsby (which flew Phantoms), that was on Quick Reaction Alert. On the evening of September 8, 1970, an object was spotted over the North Sea by radar and he was on duty so took off to follow the object. His callsign was Foxtrot 94.
Further radar observation.
The object was then tracked by the early warning station at RAF Fylingdales and by the USAF radar station at Thule Air Base in Greenland and the Cheyenne Mountain radar base in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA. The Lightning planes were asked to return to their base in Leuchars, and the Phantom planes patrolled the area. At 21.30, the object was picked up on radar again heading south-west over the north of Denmark. Two Lightning planes were scrambled from RAF Leuchars, to patrol to the north-east of Aberdeen, and two Lightning planes were scrambled from RAF Coltishall. The Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska was informed of the incident as well as NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain. A Shackleton maritime plane that had been patrolling the Firth of Forth then circled the area around Flamborough Head.
Contact with the object.
Captain Schaffner, of 5 Squadron, took off from Binbrook in the Lightning plane "XS894" at 22.06. He had boarded the plane whilst its fuel tanks were still being filled. The plane was armed with two Red Top air-to-air missiles. The object was flying east of Whitby and parallel to the coast. It was tracked by RAF Staxton Wold in North Yorkshire.
Removal of the crashed Lightning.
Three weeks later, the plane was located on the sea bed. On October 7, 1970, Royal Navy divers located the plane. The plane was recovered from the sea three months later and was remarkably intact. The canopy was closed but there was no sign of the body of Captain Schaffner. The wreckage was taken back to RAF Binbrook for investigation. Normally this would have happened at the MOD Crash Investigation Branch, part of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (now the Air Accidents Investigation Branch) at Farnborough.
Other incidents the same year.
In the period of Autumn 1970 to Spring 1971, UFOs were seen over the Lincolnshire coast around Cleethorpes. At RAF Donna Nook, a large (180 ft long) UFO was seen hovering for many hours by RAF personnel and was accompanied by 'glass ball' objects.

Matunuck, Rhode Island

Matunuck is a village in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, United States near Charlestown, Rhode Island. The village is located on a point along the southern Atlantic coast of Rhode Island off of U.S. Route 1. The village takes its name from a Native American word meaning "look out." The Narragansett tribe made a summer encampment at this location before the land was sold to colonists as part of the Pettaquamscutt purchase.
Geography and attractions.
The area is home to several notable beaches including Moonstone Beach, South Kingstown Town Beach at Matunuck, East Matunuck State Beach, and Roy Carpenter's Beach and cottages. The well-known Theatre-by-the-Sea playhouse is also in Matunuck and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also well known Ocean Mist and Tara's Joyce Family Pub are located directly on the beach in Matunuck and are under constant threat of erosion issues. In the 80's there were three commercial fishing boats (Snow’s and Campbell’s Chowder) dredging large sea clams of the coast of Matunck and Green Hill. That dredging process destroyed the sea kelp field that buffered the coast from storms leaving the coastline defenseless against erosion. Since the late 80’s the Matunck coast erosion takes 1.3 feet of beach each year.

Wesley A. Ward

Wesley A. Ward (born March 3, 1968 in Selah, Washington) is a retired American Champion jockey and a current trainer in Thoroughbred horse racing. He grew up in the horse racing industry, the son of trainer Dennis Ward. 
In 1984, Wesley Ward was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Apprentice Jockey following a season in which he won riding championships at Aqueduct Racetrack, Belmont Park, and the Meadowlands Racetrack and rode 335 winners. He went on to compete at racetracks in Italy, Malaysia and Singapore before his battles with weight gain led to retirement in 1989.
Wesley Ward turned to training, first as an assistant to his father before going out on his own in 1993. He earned his first stakes win as a trainer in 1994 at Hollywood Park, winning the Cinema Handicap. Based in California, he also races at Gulfstream Park in Florida during the winter months. He has had 3 children, Riley Ward, Denae Ward, and Jackson Ward. His son, Riley, is currently enrolled in Pine Crest School.
On June 16, 2009, Ward became the first U.S.-based conditioner to ship a horse to England and win a stakes race at the prestigious Royal Ascot meeting. Strike the Tiger, a 2-year-old gelding co-bred and co-owned by Ward, shocked the meet by taking the Windsor Castle Stakes at odds of 33-1. The following day, Ward sent out a 2-year-old filly named Jealous Again to claim an even bigger Ascot victory. She took the Group 2 Queen Mary Stakes by a comfortable five lengths.
Ward also suffered setbacks at that Ascot meeting—4-year-old Cannonball was sixth in the Group 1 King's Stand Stakes, and juveniles Yogaroo (Norfolk Stakes-G2), Aegean (Albany Stakes-G3) and Honor in Peace (Chesham Stakes) were also-rans in their events. But Cannonball was wheeled back on four days' rest, almost unheard of in American racing circles, and ran second in the Group 1 Golden Jubilee Stakes. In 2013 Ward scored a further Royal Ascot success when No Nay Never won the Group 2 Norfolk Stakes, and a first European Group 1 win when the same horse won the Prix Morny at Deauville in August.

Samuel and Nathaniel Buck

Samuel and Nathaniel Buck were brothers who lived in England in the 18th century and were engravers and printmakers. Samuel did much work on his own but, when the brothers worked together, they were usually known as the Buck Brothers. More is known about Samuel than about Nathaniel.
Samuel Buck was born in Yorkshire in 1696. After publishing some prints in that county, he moved to London. With Nathaniel he embarked on making a number of series of prints of "antiquities", which consisted of ruined castles and former religious buildings in England and Wales. Starting in 1724, they travelled around the countries, completing the sets of prints for the regions of England by 1738 and producing those for Wales between 1739 and 1742. These are commonly known as "Buck's Antiquities". During this time they also worked on a series of townscapes in England and Wales entitled "Cities, Sea-ports and Capital Towns".
Nathaniel was the first to die, sometime between 1759 and 1774. Samuel's later years were spent in poverty. He died on 17 August 1779 in London and was buried in the churchyard of St. Clement Danes.

No. 275 Squadron RAF

No. 275 Squadron RAF was a Royal Air Force air-sea rescue squadron that served between 1941 and 1959.
History.
No. 275 Squadron RAF was formed at RAF Valley on 15 October 1941 for air-sea rescue duties in the Irish sea, the first aircraft being Lysanders Mk.IIIa's. Later in the year Walruses were added to the Squadron followed by Defiants, Spitfires and Ansons.
In April 1944 the Squadron moved to RAF Warmwell to cover the sea area between England and Normandy. Air-sea rescue missions continued until 15 February 1945 when the Squadron was disbanded at RAF Harrowbeer. 
No. 275 squadron was reformed at RAF Linton-on-Ouse as a sea and rescue Squadron to provide cover over the North Sea on March 1953 equipped with Sycamore HR.13 and HR.14 Helicopters, later relocating to RAF Thornaby on 18 November 1954 and remaining at Thornaby until October 1957 when the Squadron moved to RAF Leconfield. In March 1959 the unit converted to the Whirlwind HAR.4 helicopter, but on 1 September 1959 the Squadron was renumbered to No. 228 Squadron RAF and No. 275 ceased to exist.

Polish Jews were the primary victims of the German Nazi-organized Holocaust. Throughout the German occupation of Poland, many Poles risked their own lives – and the lives of their families – to rescue Jews from the Nazis. Grouped by nationality, Poles represent the biggest number of people who rescued Jews during the Holocaust. To date, 6,266 Poles have been awarded the title of Righteous among the Nations by the State of Israel – more than any other nation.
The Armia Krajowa (Polish resistance) alerted the world to the Holocaust, notably with the reports of Witold Pilecki and Jan Karski. The Polish government in exile and the Polish Secret State asked for American and British help to stop the Holocaust, to no avail.
Some estimates put the number of Poles involved in rescue at up to 3 million, and credit Poles with saving up to around 450,000 Jews from certain death. The rescue efforts were aided by one of the largest anti-Nazi resistance movements in Europe, the Polish Underground State and its military arm, the Armia Krajowa. Supported by the Polish government in exile, these organizations operated special units dedicated to helping Jews; of those, the most notable was Żegota.
Polish citizens were hampered by the most extreme conditions in all of German-occupied Europe. Nazi-occupied Poland was the only territory where the Germans decreed that any kind of help for Jews was punishable by death for the helper and his entire family. Of the estimated 3 million non-Jewish Poles killed in World War II, up to 50,000 were executed by Nazi Germany solely as a penalty for saving Jews. After the War most of this information was suppressed by the Soviet-backed regime in an attempt to discredit Polish prewar society and government as reactionary.
Background.
Numbers.
Before World War II, 3,300,000 Jewish people lived in Poland – ten percent of the general population of some 33 million. Poland was the center of the European Jewish world.
The Second World War began with the Nazi German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939; and, on September 17, in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement, the Soviet Union attacked Poland from the east. By October 1939, the Second Polish Republic was divided between the two totalitarian powers, with Nazi Germany occupying western and central Poland. The Germans regarded Poles as "sub-human" and Polish Jews somewhere beneath that category, treating both groups with extreme and brutal harshness. One aspect of German policy in conquered Poland was to prevent its ethnically diverse population from uniting against Germany. The Nazi plan for Polish Jews was one of concentration, isolation, and eventually total annihilation in what is now known as the Holocaust or "Shoa". Nazi plans for the Polish Catholic majority focused on the murder or suppression of political, religious, and intellectual leaders as well as the Germanization of the annexed lands which included a program to resettle Germans from the Baltic and other regions onto farms, ventures and homes formerly owned by Poles and Jews.
The response of the Polish majority to the Jewish Holocaust covered an extremely wide spectrum, often ranging from acts of altruism at the risk of endangering their own and their families’ lives, through compassion, to passivity, indifference, and outright brutality. Polish rescuers also faced threats from unsympathetic neighbours, the Volksdeutsche and the ethnic Ukrainian pro-Nazis, as well as blackmailers called szmalcowniks and (as in Warsaw) from Jewish collaborators such as Żagiew or Group 13. There were cases of denunciation or even participation in massacres of Jewish inhabitants. The guidelines for such massacres were formulated by Reinhard Heydrich, who ordered his chiefs to induce anti-Jewish pogroms on territories newly occupied by the German forces. Statistics of the Israeli War Crimes Commission indicate that less than a tenth of 1 per cent of Poles collaborated with the Nazis.
Non–Jewish Poles provided assistance to Jews in organized fashion as well as through varying degrees of individual efforts. Many Poles offered food to Polish Jews and left food in places Jews would pass on their way to forced labour. Others directed Jewswho managed to escape from the ghettosto people who could help them. Some sheltered Jews for only one or a few nights, others assumed full responsibility for the Jews' survival, well aware that the Nazis punished those who helped Jews by summary killings. A special role fell to the Polish medical doctors who alone saved thousands of Jews through their subversive practise. For example, Dr. Eugeniusz Łazowski, known as Polish 'Schindler', saved 8,000 Polish Jews from deportation to death camps, by faking an epidemic of typhus in the town of Rozwadów. Free medicine was given out in the Kraków Ghetto by Tadeusz Pankiewicz saving unspecified number of Jews. Rudolf Weigl employed and protected Jews in his Institute in Lwów. His vaccines were smuggled into the local ghetto as well as the ghetto in Warsaw saving countless lives. It is mostly those who took full responsibility who qualify for the title of the Righteous Among the Nations. To date, a total of 6,066 Poles have been officially recognized by Israel as the Polish Righteous among the Nations for their efforts in rescuing Polish Jews during the Holocaust, making Poland the country with the highest number of Righteous in the world.
The number of Poles who rescued Jews from the Nazi persecution would be hard to determine in black-and-white terms, and is still the subject of scholarly debate. According to Gunnar S. Paulsson, the number of rescuers that meet Yad Vashem's criteria is perhaps 100,000, and there may have been two or three times as many who offered minor forms of help, while the majority "were passively protective." In an article published in the "Journal of Genocide Research", Hans G. Furth estimated that there may have been as many as 1,200,000 Polish rescuers.
Richard C. Lukas estimated that upwards of 1,000,000 Poles were involved in such rescue efforts, "but some estimates go as high as three million." Lukas also cites Władysław Bartoszewski, a wartime member of "Żegota", as having estimated that "at least several hundred thousand Poles ... participated in various ways and forms in the rescue action." Elsewhere, Bartoszewski has estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the Polish population was actively involved in rescue efforts; Marcin Urynowicz estimates that a minimum of from 500 thousand to over a million Poles actively tried to help Jews. Teresa Prekerowa has estimated that between 160,000 and 360,000 Poles assisted in hiding Jews, amounting to between 1 and 2.5% of the 15 million adult Poles she categorizes as "those who could offer help. Prekerowa arrived at her estimate by assuming that it took two or three non-Jewish Poles to hide one Jew, while other sources indicate that a much higher number was involved (e.g., Paulsson estimates that it might have taken a "dozen or more" people for each person hidden). Prekerowa's estimation only counts those who were involved in hiding Jews directly and does not include those who were involved in other types of rescue efforts. It also assumes that each Jew who hid among the non-Jewish populace stayed throughout the war in only one hiding place and as such had only one set of helpers; Paulsson, on the other hand, wrote that an average Jew in hiding stayed in seven different places throughout the war.
According to Paulsson, an average Jew who survived in occupied Poland depended not on the actions of a single person, but on many acts of assistance and tolerance. As Paulsson notes: "nearly every Jew that was rescued, was rescued by the cooperative efforts of dozen or more people". During the six years of wartime and occupation, the average Jew was sheltered in seven different locations, had three or four sets of documents, two or three encounters with blackmailers, and faced recognition as a Jew multiple times.
Father John T. Pawlikowski referring to work by other historians speculated that claims of hundreds of thousands of rescuers struck him as inflated. Martin Gilbert has written that under Nazi regime, rescuers were an exception, albeit one that could be found in towns and villages throughout Poland.
There is no official number of how many Polish Jews were hidden by their Christian countrymen during wartime. Lukas estimated that the number of Jews sheltered by Poles at one time might have been "as high as 450,000." However, concealment did not automatically assure complete safety from the Nazis, and the number of Jews in hiding who were caught has been estimated variously from 40,000 to 200,000.
Difficulties.
Efforts at rescue were encumbered by several factors. The threat of the death penalty for aiding Jews and limited ability to provide for the escapees were often responsible for the fact that most Poles were unwilling to provide direct help to a person of Jewish origin. This was exacerbated by the fact that the people who were in hiding did not have official ration cards and hence food for them had to be purchased on the black market at high prices. According to Emmanuel Ringelblum in most cases the money that Poles accepted from Jews they helped to hide, was taken not out of greed, but out of poverty which Poles had to endure during the German occupation. Israel Gutman has written that the majority of Jews who were sheltered by Poles paid for their own protection, but sadly, a large number of Polish protectors perished along with the people they were hiding.
There is general consensus among scholars that, unlike in Western Europe, Polish collaboration with the Nazis was insignificant. However, the Nazi terror combined with inadequacy of food rations, as well as German greed and the system of corruption as the only "one language the Germans understood well", wrecked traditional values. Poles helping Jews faced unparalleled dangers not only from the German occupiers but also from their own ethnically diverse countrymen including Volksdeutsche, and Polish Ukrainians, who were anti-Semitic and morally disoriented by the war. There were people, the so-called szmalcownicy ("shmalts people" from "shmalts" or "szmalec", Yiddish and Polish for “grease” and slang term for money), who blackmailed the hiding Jews and Poles helping the Jews, or who turned them to the Germans for a reward. Outside the cities there were also some peasants looking for Jews who hid in the forests to demand money or turn them over to the Germans for a reward. The vast majority of these individuals joined the criminal underworld only after the German occupation and were responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people, both Jews and the Poles who were trying to save them.
The threat of denunciation not only deterred many Jews from attempting to find shelter among Poles, but also forestalled Poles of good will who feared denunciators.
According to one reviewer of Paulsson, with regard to the extortionists, "a single hooligan or blackmailer could wreak severe damage on Jews in hiding, but it took the silent passivity of a whole crowd to maintain their cover." He also notes that "hunters" were outnumbered by "helpers" by a ratio of one to 20 or 30. According to Lukas the number of renegades who blackmailed and denounced Jews and their Polish protectors probably did not number more than 1,000 individuals out of the 1,300,000 people living in Warsaw in 1939.
Michael C. Steinlauf writes that not only the fear of the death penalty was an obstacle limiting Polish aid to Jews, but also some prewar attitudes towards Jews, which made many individuals uncertain of their neighbors' reaction to their attempts at rescue. Number of authors have noted the negative consequences of the hostility towards Jews by extremists advocating their eventual removal from Poland. Meanwhile, Alina Cala in her study of Jews in Polish folk culture argued also for the persistence of traditional religious antisemitism and anti-Jewish propaganda before and during the war both leading to indifference. Steinlauf however notes that despite these uncertainties, Jews were helped by countless thousands of individual Poles throughout the country. He writes that "not the informing or the indifference, but the existence of such individuals is one of the most remarkable features of Polish-Jewish relations during the Holocaust." Nechama Tec, who herself survived the war aided by a group of Catholic Poles, noted that Polish rescuers worked within an environment that was hostile to Jews and unfavorable to their protection, in which rescuers feared both the disapproval of their neighbors and reprisals that such disapproval might bring. Tec also noted that Jews, for many complex and practical reasons, were not always prepared to accept assistance that was available to them. Some Jews did not expect help from their Polish neighbors — in fact, some were surprised to have been aided by some people who expressed antisemitic attitudes before the war. Similar sentiment was expressed by Mordecai Paldiel, former Director of the Department of the Righteous at Yad Vashem, who writes that the widespread revulsion at the murders being committed by the Nazis was sometimes accompanied by a feeling of relief at the disappearance of Jews. A Yad Vashem study of Żegota cites an interview, in which the organization's Deputy Chairman, Tadeusz Rek, mentions his report to the representatives of the Polish government-in-exile claiming "that the overwhelming majority of Polish society are hostile toward those extending relief." Paulsson and Pawlikowski write that overall, such negative attitudes were not a major factor impeding the survival of sheltered Jews, or the work of the rescue organization "Żegota".
The fact that the Polish Jewish community was decimated during World War II, coupled with stories about Polish collaborators, has contributed, especially among Israelis and American Jews, to a lingering stereotype that the Polish population has been passive in regard to, or even supportive of, Jewish suffering. However, modern scholarship has not validated the claim that Polish antisemitism was irredeemable or different from contemporary Western antisemitism; it has also found that such claims are among the stereotypes that comprise anti-Polonism. The presenting of selective evidence in support of preconceived notions have led some popular press to draw overly simplistic and often misleading conclusions regarding the role played by Poles at the time of the Holocaust.
Punishment for aiding the Jews.
In an attempt to discourage Poles from helping the Jews and to destroy any efforts of the resistance, the Germans applied a ruthless retaliation policy.
On November 10, 1941, the death penalty was introduced by Hans Frank, governor of the General Government, to apply to Poles who helped Jews "in any way: by taking them in for the night, giving them a lift in a vehicle of any kind" or "feedrunaway Jews or sell[ing them foodstuffs." The law was made public by posters distributed in all major cities.
The imposition of the death penalty for Poles aiding Jews was unique to Poland among all Nazi occupied countries, and was a result of the conspicuous and spontaneous nature of such an aid. For example, the Ulma family (father, mother and six children) of the village of Markowa near Łańcut – where many families concealed their Jewish neighbors – were executed jointly by the Nazis with the eight Jews they hid. The entire Wołyniec family in Romaszkańce was massacred for sheltering three Jewish refugees from a ghetto. In Maciuńce, for hiding Jews, the Germans shot eight members of Józef Borowski family along with him and four guests who happened to be there. Nazi death squads carried out mass executions of the entire villages that were discovered to be aiding Jews on a communal level. In the villages of Białka near Parczew and Sterdyń near Sokołów Podlaski, 150 villagers were massacred for sheltering Jews. In November 1942, the Ukrainian SS squad executed 20 villagers from Berecz in Wołyń Voivodeship for giving aid to Jewish escapees from the ghetto in Povorsk. According to Peter Jaroszczak "Michał Kruk and several other people in Przemyśl were executed on September 6, 1943 ("pictured") for the assistance they had rendered to the Jews. Altogether, in the town and its environs 415 Jews (including 60 children) were saved, in return for which the Germans killed 568 people of Polish nationality." Several hundred Poles were massacred with their priest, Adam Sztark, in Słonim on December 18, 1942, for sheltering Jews in a church. In Huta Stara near Buczacz, Polish Christians and the Jewish countrymen they protected, were herded into a church by the Nazis and burned alive on March 4, 1944. In the years 1942-1944 about 200 peasants were shot dead and burned alive as punishment in the Kielce region alone.
Entire communities that helped shelter Jews were annihilated, such as the now-extinct village of Huta Werchobuska near Złoczów, Zahorze near Łachwa, Huta Pieniacka near Brody or Stara Huta near Szumsk.
Additionally, after the end of the war Poles who saved Jews during the Nazi occupation very often became the victims of repression at the hands of the communist security apparatus, due to their instinctive devotion to social justice which they saw as being abused by the government.
Jews in Polish villages.
A number of Polish villages in their entirety provided shelter from Nazi apprehension, offering protection for their Jewish neighbors as well as the aid for refugees from other villages and escapees from the ghettos. Postwar research has confirmed that communal protection occurred in Głuchów near Łańcut with everyone engaged, as well as in the villages of Główne, Ozorków, Borkowo near Sierpc, Dąbrowica near Ulanów, in Głupianka near Otwock, and Teresin near Chełm.
The forms of protection varied from village to village. In Gołąbki, the farm of Jerzy and Irena Krępeć provided a hiding place for as many as 30 Jews; years after the war, the couple's son recalled in an interview with the "Montreal Gazette" that their actions were "an open secret in the village everyone knew they had to keep quiet" and that the other villagers helped, "if only to provide a meal." Another farm couple, Alfreda and Bolesław Pietraszek, provided shelter for Jewish families consisting of 18 people in Ceranów near Sokołów Podlaski, and their neighbors brought food to those being rescued.
Two decades after the end of the war, a Jewish partisan named Gustaw Alef-Bolkowiak identified the following villages in the Parczew-Ostrów Lubelski area where "almost the entire population" assisted Jews: Rudka, Jedlanka, Makoszka, Tyśmienica, and Bójki. Historians have documented that a dozen villagers of Mętów near Głusk outside Lublin sheltered Polish Jews.
In some documented cases, Polish Jews who were hidden were circulated between locations in a village. Farmers in Zdziebórz near Wyszków, by turns, sheltered two Jewish men who later joined the Polish resistance Armia Krajowa (Home Army). The entire village of Mulawicze near Bielsk Podlaski took responsibility for the survival of an orphaned nine-year-old Jewish boy. Different families took turns hiding a Jewish girl at various homes in Wola Przybysławska near Lublin, and around Jabłoń near Parczew many Polish Jews successfully sought refuge.
Impoverished Polish Jews, unable to offer any money in return, were nonetheless provided with food, clothing, shelter and money by some small communities; historians have confirmed this took place in the villages of Czajków near Staszów as well as several villages near Łowicz, in Korzeniówka near Grójec, near Żyrardów, in Łaskarzew, and across Kielce Voivodship.
In tiny villages where there was no permanent Nazi military presence, such as Dąbrowa Rzeczycka, Kępa Rzeczycka and Wola Rzeczycka near Stalowa Wola, some Jews were able to openly participate in the lives of their communities. Olga Lilien, recalling her wartime experience in the 2000 book "To Save a Life: Stories of Holocaust Rescue", was sheltered by a Polish family in a village near Tarnobrzeg, where she survived the war despite the posting of a 200 deutsche mark reward by the Nazi occupiers for information on Jews in hiding. Chava Grinberg-Brown from Gmina Wiskitki recalled in a postwar interview that some farmers used the threat of violence against a fellow villager who intimated the desire to betray her safety. Polish-born Israeli writer and Holocaust survivor Natan Gross, in his 2001 book "Who Are You, Mr. Grymek?", told of a village near Warsaw where a local Nazi collaborator was forced to flee when it became known he reported the location of a hidden Jew.
Nonetheless there were cases were Poles who saved Jews were met with a different response after the war. Antonina Wyrzykowska from Janczewko village near Jedwabne managed to successfully shelter seven Jews for twenty-six months from November 1942 until liberation. Some time earlier, during the Jedwabne pogrom close by, a minimum of 300 Polish Jews were burned alive in a barn set on fire by a group of Polish men under the German command. Among the Jews rescued by Wyrzykowska was Szmuel Wasersztajn who, without seeing anything that happened, later falsely accused many innocent Poles of the crime. Wyrzykowska was honored as Righteous among the Nations for her heroism, but left her hometown after liberation for fear of retribution.
Jews in Polish cities.
In Poland's cities and larger towns, the Nazi occupiers created ghettos that were designed to imprison the local Jewish populations. The food rations allocated by the Germans to the ghettos condemned their inhabitants to starvation. Smuggling of food into the ghettos and smuggling of goods out of the ghettos, organized by Jews and Poles, was the only means of subsistence of the Jewish population in the ghettos. The price difference between the Aryan and Jewish sides was large, reaching as much as 100%, but the penalty for aiding Jews was death. Hundreds of Polish and Jewish smugglers would come in and out the ghettos, usually at night or at dawn, through openings in the walls, underground tunnels and sewers or through the guardposts by paying bribes.
The Polish Underground urged the Poles to support smuggling. The punishment for smuggling was death, carried out on the spot. Among the Jewish smuggler victims were scores of Jewish children aged five or six, whom the German shot at the ghetto exits and near the walls. While communal rescue was impossible under these circumstances, many Polish Christians concealed their Jewish neighbors. For example, Zofia Baniecka and her mother rescued over 50 Jews in their home between 1941 and 1944. Paulsson, in his research on the Jews of Warsaw, documented that Warsaw's Polish residents managed to support and conceal the same percentage of Jews as did residents in other European cities under Nazi occupation.
Ten percent of Warsaw's Polish population was actively engaged in sheltering their Jewish neighbors. It is estimated that the number of Jews living in hiding on the Aryan side of the capital city in 1944 was at least 15,000 to 30,000 and relied on the network of 50,000–60,000 Poles who provided shelter, and about half as many assisting in other ways.
Organizations dedicated to saving the Jews.
Several organizations were created and run by ethnic Poles and Jewish underground activists, dedicated to saving the Polish Jewish community. Among those, "Żegota", the Council to Aid Jews, was the most prominent. It was unique not only in Poland, but in all of Nazi-occupied Europe, as there was no other organization dedicated solely to that goal. "Żegota" concentrated its efforts on saving Jewish children toward whom the Germans were especially cruel. Polish sociologist Tadeusz Piotrowski estimates that about half of the Jews who survived the war (more than 50,000) were aided by "Żegota" with various forms of assistance – financial, legalization, medical, child care, and help against blackmailers. In his 1977 study Joseph Kermish asserts that a number of Polish sources overestimated the levels of support Żegota provided to Jews, saving perhaps only a few thousands of Jews (although this lower figure only counts those saved in Warsaw rather than all of occupied Poland); nonetheless the study concurs that the activities of Żegota "constitute one of the most brilliant chapters in the efforts to extend relief to Jews."
Perhaps the most famous member of "Żegota" was Irena Sendler, who managed to successfully smuggle 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Besides "Żegota", there were few smaller, less effective organizations, which on their actions agenda included help to the Jews. Some were associated with "Zegota".
Jews and the Church.
The Roman Catholic Church in Poland provided many persecuted Jews with food and shelter during the war, even though monasteries gave no immunity to Polish priests and monks against the death penalty. Nearly every Catholic institution in Poland looked after a few Jews, usually children with forged Christian birth certificates and an assumed or vague identity. In particular, convents of Catholic nuns in Poland (see Sister Bertranda), played a major role in the effort to rescue and shelter Polish Jews, with the Franciscan Sisters credited with the largest number of Jewish children saved. Two thirds of all nunneries in Poland took part in the rescue, in all likelihood with the support and encouragement of the church hierarchy. These efforts were supported by local Polish bishops and the Vatican itself. The convent leaders never disclosed the exact number of children saved in their institutions, and for security reasons the rescued children were never registered. Jewish institutions have no statistics that could clarify the matter. Systematic recording of testimonies did not begin until the early 1970s. In the villages of Ożarów, Ignaców, Szymanów, and Grodzisko near Leżajsk, the Jewish children were cared for by Catholic convents and by the surrounding communities. In these villages, Christian parents did not remove their children from schools where Jewish children were in attendance.
Irena Sendler head of children's section Żegota (the Council to Aid Jews) organisation cooperated very closely in saving Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto with social worker and catholic nun, mother provincial of Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary - Matylda Getter. The children were placed with Polish families, the Warsaw orphanage of the Sisters of the Family of Mary, or Roman Catholic convents such as the Little Sister Servants of the Blessed Virgin Mary Conceived Immaculate at Turkowice and Chotomów. Sister Matylda Getter rescued between 250-550 Jewish children in different education and care facilities for children in Anin, Białołęka, Chotomów, Międzylesie, Płudy, Sejny, Vilnius and others. Getter's convent was located at the entrance to the Warsaw Ghetto. When the Nazis commenced the clearing of the Ghetto in 1941, Getter took in many orphans and dispersed them among Family of Mary homes. As the Nazis began sending orphans to the gas chambers, Getter issued fake baptismal certificates, providing the children with false identities. The sisters lived in daily fear of the Germans. Michael Phayer credits Getter and the Family of Mary with rescuing more than 750 Jews.
Historians have determined that in some villages, Jewish families survived the Holocaust by living under assumed identities as Christians — with the knowledge of their neighbors, who did not betray their identities. This has been confirmed in the villages of Bielsko (Upper Silesia), in Dziurków near Radom, in Olsztyn Village near Częstochowa, in Korzeniówka near Grójec, in Łaskarzew, Sobolew, and Wilga triangle, and in several villages near Łowicz.
Some officials in the senior Polish priesthood however, remained hostile toward the Jews – a theological attitude well-known from before the war. After the war, some convents were unwilling to return children to Jewish institutions that asked for them and refused to disclose the adoptive parents' identities, forcing government agencies and courts to intervene.
Jews and the Polish government.
Lack of international effort to aid Jews resulted in political uproar on the part of the Polish government in exile residing in Great Britain. The government often publicly expressed outrage at German mass murders of Jews. In 1942, Directorate of Civil Resistance, part of the Polish Underground State, issued a following declaration based on reports by Polish underground. 
Polish government was the first to inform the Western Allies about the Holocaust, although early reports were often met with disbelief even by Jewish leaders themselves; then, for much longer, by Western powers. 
Witold Pilecki was member of Polish Armia Krajowa resistance, and the only person who volunteered to be imprisoned in Auschwitz. As agent of underground intelligence he begun sending numerous reports about camp and genocide to Polish resistance headquarters in Warsaw through the resistance network he organized in Auschwitz. In March 1941, Pilecki's reports were being forwarded via the Polish resistance to the British government in London but the British authorities refused AK reports on atrocities as be a gross exaggerations and propaganda of Polish government.
Similarly, Jan Karski, who had been serving as a courier between the Polish underground and the Polish government in exile, was smuggled into the Warsaw Ghetto and reported to the Polish, British and American governments on the situation of Jews in Poland. In 1942 Karski reported to the Polish, British and U.S. governments on the situation in Poland, especially the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto and the Holocaust of the Jews. He met with Polish politicians in exile including the prime minister, as well as members of political parties such as the Polish Socialist Party, National Party, Labor Party, People's Party, Jewish Bund and Poalei Zion. He also spoke to Anthony Eden, the British foreign secretary, and included a detailed statement on what he had seen in Warsaw and Bełżec. In 1943 in London he met the then much known journalist Arthur Koestler. He then traveled to the United States and reported to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
In July 1943, Jan Karski again personally reported to Roosevelt about the plight of Polish Jews, but the president "interrupted and asked the Polish emissary about the situation of... horses" in Poland. He also met with many other government and civic leaders in the United States, including Felix Frankfurter, Cordell Hull, William Joseph Donovan, and Stephen Wise. Karski also presented his report to media, bishops of various denominations (including Cardinal Samuel Stritch), members of the Hollywood film industry and artists, but without success. Many of those he spoke to did not believe him and again supposed that his testimony was much exaggerated or was propaganda from the Polish government in exile.
The supreme political body of the underground government within Poland was the Delegatura. There were no Jewish representatives in it. Delegatura financed and sponsored "Żegota", the organization for help to the Polish Jews – run jointly by Jews and non-Jews. Żegota was granted nearly 29 million zlotys (over $ 5 million dollars; or, 13.56 times as much in today's funds) by Delegatura since 1942 for the relief payments to thousands of extended Jewish families in Poland. The government in exile also provided special assistance – funds, arms and other supplies – to Jewish resistance organizations (like ŻOB and ŻZW), particularly from 1942 onwards. The interim government transmitted messages from Jewish underground to the West and gave support to their requests for retaliation on German targets if the atrocities are not stopped – a request that was dismissed by the Allied governments. The Polish government also tried, without much success, to increase the chances of Polish refugees finding a safe haven in neutral countries and to prevent deportations of escaping Jews back to Nazi-occupied Poland.
Polish Delegate of the Government in Exile residing in Hungary, Henryk Slawik, helped rescue over 5,000 Hungarian and Polish Jews in Budapest, by giving them false Polish passports as non-Jews.
With two members on the National Council, Polish Jews were sufficiently represented in the government in exile. Also, in 1943 a Jewish affairs section of the Underground State was set up by the Government Delegation for Poland; it was headed by Witold Bieńkowski and Władysław Bartoszewski. Its purpose was to organize efforts concerning the Polish Jewish population, to coordinate with "Zegota", and to prepare documentation about the fate of the Jews for the government in London. Regrettably, the great number of Polish Jews had been killed already even before the Government-in-exile fully realized the totality of the Final Solution. According to David Engel and Daniel Stola, the government-in-exile primarily concerned itself with the fate of Polish people in general, reestablishing independent Polish state and establishing itself as an equal partner amongst the Allied forces. On top of its relative weakness, the government in exile was subject to the scrutiny of the West, in particular, American and British Jews reluctant to criticize their own governments for inaction in regard to saving their fellow Jews.
The Polish government and its underground representatives at home issued declarations that people acting against the Jews (blackmailers and others) would be punished by death. General Władysław Sikorski, the Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, signed a following decree and called upon the Polish population to extend aid to the persecuted Jews:
However, according to Michael C. Steinlauf, only on rare occasions did appeals to Poles to help Jews accompany these statements before the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in 1943. Steinlauf points out that in one speech made in London Sikorski was promising equal rights for Jews after the war, but the promise was omitted from the printed Polish version of the speech. According to David Engel, the loyalty of Polish Jews to Poland and Polish interests was held in doubt by some members of the exiled government, leading to political tensions. Overall, as Stola notes, Polish government was just as unprepared to deal with the Holocaust as were the other Allied governments, and that the government's hesitancy in appeals to the general population to aid the Jews diminished only after reports of the Holocaust became more wide spread.
Szmul Zygielbojm, a member of the National Council of the Polish government in exile, committed suicide in May 1943, in London, in protest against the indifference of the Allied governments toward the destruction of the Jewish people, and the failure of the Polish government to rouse public opinion commensurate with the scale of the tragedy befalling Polish Jews.
Poland, with its unique underground state, was the only country in occupied Europe to have an extensive, underground justice system. These clandestine courts operated with attention to due process (obviously limited by circumstances) and as a result it could take months to get a death sentence passed, much as in regular judicial systems. However, Prekerowa notes that the death sentences only began to be issued in September 1943, which meant that blackmailers were able to operate undeterred for 3 years from the time of the sealing of the Jewish ghettos in Autumn 1940. Overall, it took the Polish underground until late 1942 to legislate and organize non-military courts which were authorized to pass death sentences for civilian crimes, such as non-treasonous collaboration, extortion and blackmail. According to Joseph Kermish, among the thousands of collaborators sentenced to death by the Special Courts and executed by the Polish resistance fighters who risked death carrying out these verdicts, very few were explicitly blackmailers or informers who had persecuted Jews. This, according to Kermish, led to increasing boldness of some of the blackmailers in their criminal activities. Marek Jan Chodakiewicz writes that a number of Polish Jews were executed for denouncing other Jews. He notes that since Nazi informers often denounced members of the underground as well as Jews in hiding, the charge of collaboration was a general one and sentences passed were for cumulative crimes.
The Home Army units under the command of officers from left-wing Sanacja, the PPS as well as the centrist Democratic Party welcomed Jewish fighters to serve with Poles without problems stemming from their ethnic identity. As noted by Joshua D. Zimmerman, many negative stereotypes about the Home Army among the Jews came from reading postwar literature on the subject, and not from personal experience. In spite of Polish Jewish representation in the London-based government in exile, some rightist units of the Armia Krajowa – as noted by Joanna B. Michlic – exhibited ethno-nationalism that excluded Jews. Similarly, some members of the Delegate's Bureau saw Jews and ethnic Poles as separate entities. Historian Israel Gutman has noted that AK leader Stefan Rowecki advocated the abandonment of the long-range considerations of the underground and the launch of an all-out uprising should the Germans undertake a campaign of extermination against ethnic Poles, but that no such plan existed while the extermination of Jewish Polish citizens was under way. On the other hand, not only the pre-war Polish government armed and trained Jewish paramilitary groups such as Lehi but also – while in exile – accepted thousands of Polish Jewish fighters into Anders Army including leaders such as Menachem Begin. The policy of support continued throughout the war with the Jewish Combat Organization and the Jewish Military Union forming an integral part of the Polish resistance.

Magic string

A magic string is an input that a programmer believes will never come externally and which activates otherwise hidden functionality. A user of this program would likely provide input that gives an expected response in most situations. However, if the user does in fact innocently provide the pre-defined input, invoking the internal functionality, the program response is often quite unexpected to the user (thus appearing 'magical').
Background.
The term comes from the fact that this type of problem is often seen in Windows Forms with editable text boxes for input. Normally such errors occur as a result of time constraints. A developer must find a fast solution instead of delving more deeply into a problem and finding a better solution.
For example, when testing a program that took a user's personal details and verified their given credit card number, a developer may decide to add a magic string shortcut whereby entering the unlikely input of "***" as a credit card number would cause the program to automatically proceed as if the card was valid, without spending time verifying it. If the developer forgets to remove the magic string, and a user of the final program happens to enter "***" as a placeholder credit card number while filling in the form, the user would inadvertently trigger the hidden functionality.
Resolution.
Situations/issues of cause.
Often there are significant time constraints out of the developer's control right from the beginning of their involvement in a project. Common issues that might lead to this anti-pattern as a result:
Strict formatting.
Restricting the format of the input is a possible maintenance (bug fixing) solution. Essentially, this means validating input information to check that it is in the correct format, in order to reduce the possibility of the magic string being discovered by the user. Examples include validating a telephone number to ensure that it contains only digits (and possibly spaces and punctuation to a limited extent) or checking that a person's name has a forename and a surname (and is appropriately capitalised). In any case, an exception is made for the magic string itself in the validation code. The idea is that, since any user would likely quickly realize the enforced strict formatting by trial and error, it would likely not occur to them to try inputting any string whatsoever; as such, the user is almost certain not to get as far as trying the magic string.
As with any input validation process, it is important to ensure that the format is not so restrictive that it unintentionally restricts some users from being able to use the application. An example of this is restricting telephone number or postal code input based on one country's system (e.g. requiring every user to give a five-digit ZIP code), causing problems for legitimate users who are based in other countries.
Purposeful implementation.
As is often the case with anti-patterns, there exist specific scenarios where magic strings are a correct solution for an implementation. Examples include cheat codes and Easter eggs.

Organ theft in Kosovo

Organ theft in Kosovo (sometimes also known as the "yellow house" case) refers to organ harvesting and killing of an indeterminate number of "disappeared" people, for which 5 people so far have been convicted in the case involving an elaborate organ trafficking network, and other cases are under investigation. Various sources estimate that the number of victims ranges from a "handful", up to 50, between 24 to 100 to over 300. The victims are believed to be mostly ethnic Serbs of Kosovo, killed by perpetrators with strong links to elements of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in 1999. By 2011, about 1,900 "disappeared" people (about two-thirds of them Albanians of Kosovo) still remained missing from the Kosovo conflict.
According to UN document, the victims were chosen from a pool of about 100 to 300 combatants and civilians taken prisoner or kidnapped by the KLA during and after the Kosovo War and then taken to detention centers and private homes in northern and central Albania. The UN document indicates the involvement or at least knowledge of several mid-level and senior KLA commanders, the men were taken to a makeshift clinic near Tirana, Albania, where they were shot in the head and then had their organs removed. The United Nations (UN) war crimes prosecutors investigated the case in 2002 and 2003, and again in 2004, but concluded there was insufficient evidence to prove that the organ harvesting ring existed.
In 2010, a report by Swiss prosecutor Dick Marty to the Council of Europe (CoE) uncovered "credible, convergent indications" of an illegal trade in human organs going back over a decade, including the deaths of a "handful" of Serb captives killed for this purpose. On 25 January 2011, the report was endorsed by the CoE, which called for a full and serious investigation. Since the issuance of the report, however, senior sources in the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) and many members of the European Parliament have expressed serious doubts regarding the report and its foundations, believing Marty failed to provide "any evidence" concerning the allegations. A EULEX special investigation was launched in August 2011.
A possibly related case of illegal, yet non-lethal, organ transplants at the Medicus clinic outside Pristina is reportedly part of an international organised crime network with links to Kosovo's government. The Medicus case resulted in the indictment and arrest of several people who are to be tried in two separate trials in Kosovo and Turkey.
Del Ponte's book (2008).
The allegations first appeared in the media in "", written in 2008 by Carla Del Ponte, a former chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In her book, Del Ponte states that Kosovo Albanians harvested organs of kidnapped ethnic Serbs after the armed conflict ended in 1999. These accusations were backed by her own visit to the site; several witnesses both in and out of the ICTY, one of whom "personally made an organ delivery" to an Albanian airport for transport abroad; and "confirmed information directly gathered by the tribunal."
Del Ponte concluded that if the case had been opened before Kosovo's declaration of independence, world governments might not have had the same stance on the Kosovo question. The Swiss government ordered Del Ponte not to discuss the case. She was accused of spreading unfounded rumors and her former press secretary distanced herself from Del Ponte. Bernard Kouchner, former top UN representative in Kosovo, stated in April 2011: "We were aware of the extortions, but we never heard of organ trafficking," rejecting the accusations made by Del Ponte.
Investigations.
"Yellow house" in Albania.
After the war in Kosovo, American journalist Michael Montgomery obtained testimony from seven former KLA soldiers who said they had transported prisoners, dead and alive, from Kosovo to Albania. Some of Montgomery's sources referred to the possibility of organ-trafficking and identified a small yellow farmhouse in the village of Rripë near the remote town of Burrel, Albania. Montgomery provided a summary of his research to the Office of Missing Persons and Forensics (OMPF) at the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). A team of UN and ICTY investigators visited the house in February 2004. They found widespread traces of blood of uncertain provenance on the floor and medical surgical equipment on the rubbish dump and in the riverbed. The family living in the house offered contradictory and inconsistent explanations for the blood and equipment.
According to Del Ponte, witness statements indicated that a doctor, described as a Kosovar from Peć, might have removed the organs from up to 50 prisoners there. The villagers objected to the exhumation of the graves where the witnesses said that several victims were buried under false Albanian names. The UN then shelved their investigation, lacking the mandate to investigate crimes committed after the war had ended and also having gathered insufficient evidence to support an indictment. Most of the witnesses were taken to Italy for their protection and seem to have "disappeared from the face of the earth", having presumably gone into hiding.
Information obtained by the Serbian radio and television B92 alleged that prisoners were trafficked in trucks from Kosovo to Gurrë, Mat, in northern Albania, and to a KLA camp in Kukës, during and after the Kosovo War. The organ harvesting was presumably performed while the prisoners were alive in the so-called "Building/Prison 320", 20 km from the "yellow house" mentioned by Del Ponte as the site of the acts. B92 also alleged they have documents revealing that Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha was asked by the KLA leader and former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj to send security forces to destroy all evidence connected to the disappearance and organ harvesting of Serbs from Kosovo who were transported to Albania.
According to the Serbian war crimes prosecution, "Building/Prison 320 is a neuro-psychiatric clinic. We believe that surgical operations were carried out there on civilians, as the conditions existed for such a thing. There was a prisoner camp there, as well as a KLA camp ... It differs markedly from what the Albanian prosecutor has been saying, who shut the case back in 2005." Serbian war crimes prosecutor, Bruno Vekarić, asserted that an additional 40 mental patients from Štimlje are thought to be victims of the organ theft. However, the Humanitarian Law Center conducted an investigation into the deaths of the named victims (two women with severe mental disabilities) and established that the women died of natural causes and were not victims of organ trafficking.
The Serbian investigation was re-launched on 21 March 2008, just ahead of Del Ponte's book release on 3 April 2008, when the country's prosecutors claimed they had sufficient evidence "to search the whole of Albania for mass graves of Serbs." Serbia urged Albania to cooperate but in late October 2008, Albanian officials replied that the charges were already investigated by the UN and Carla Del Ponte and that the Serbian government had no new evidence. On 14 November 2008, UNMIK invited Serbian war crimes prosecutors to join with them in a new investigation about the "yellow house".
On 20 November 2008, in line with ICTY's commitment of cooperation with Serbia, current ICTY chief Serge Brammertz provided Serbia evidence of the operation house in northern Albania. In response, the Albanian prosecutor said only a small amount of penicillin was found. An ICTY report stated that seven points were confirmed in the allegations and that the Albanian prosecutor and UNMIK failed to tell the truth when investigating the findings concerning surgical equipment.
According to the UN, the Albanian government has been trying to prevent inquiries into possible war crimes and the involvement of KLA elements in organ trade, even after proof of surgical procedures in the Burrel house was presented to them. Albanian officials claim that the allegations are speculative. However, Human Rights Watch believes otherwise. HRW has been conducting its own investigation into the allegations and has been calling for an independent probe to investigate crimes by former leaders of the KLA. HRW believes the allegations are credible and that simple harvesting of kidneys could have been easily performed even without surgical tools, although such were found at the scene.
In August 2009, Albanians in the village of Rripë prevented representatives of the CoE (under Dick Marty) from searching houses relating to the case. The locals said they would not let anyone other than the Albanian government examine potential evidence, although the Albanian and Kosovo authorities have said they will not investigate. Serbian war crime prosecutors have said that new evidence has been found and that the investigation is ongoing. The Council of Europe is still interested in the case and embassies are sending data to the war crimes committee. Additionally, new potential witnesses have been found that could "open up the case in the real sense of the word".
On 27 December 2009, Serbian prosecutor Vladimir Vukčević announced that the names of "the people who were in the house" were uncovered, as well as victims from beyond Kosovo, "some Russian and Czech citizens". He further advised that organs were believed sold "in the West and East, in Turkey, and Saudi Arabia". On 9 September 2012, Vukčević said Serbia is protecting an unnamed witness, described as a former KLA member who claims to have participated in harvesting a heart from a Serb captive in northern Albania and transporting it to the airport near Tirana. Serbian prosecutors "estimate that the information this witness has given is true."
In June 2009, a Kosovo Serb and two Serbian citizens, accused of being provocateurs, were arrested by the Kosovo Police for allegedly offering money in exchange for statements confirming organ trading and to mediators finding such information. The three have been investigated for inciting people to falsely testify that they were victims of organ harvesting. The accused were released in February 2010 and the case was dismissed by EULEX.
In May 2010, EULEX chief war crimes investigator Matti Raatikainen said: "The fact is that there is no evidence whatsoever in this case. No bodies. No witnesses. All the reports and media attention to this issue have not been helpful to us. In fact they have not been helpful to anyone." According to BBC News, Raatikainen said that "the main problem" was that "the scandal created by the allegations has distracted attention from the real work of finding the remains of 1,861 people still missing from the war and its aftermath, and prosecuting their killers - in Serbia, Kosovo and Albania." Earlier that same month, EULEX made the first arrest in connection with a case of illegal detention camps in Albania, especially in the north-east Albanian town of Kukës, which held ethnic Albanians suspected of disloyalty to the KLA. "But constant revelations in the Serbian press that new evidence, or new witnesses have emerged for the organ-trafficking allegations, have all proven either false, or unsubstantiated," according to BBC News. One EULEX investigator called it a "fairy-tale". A source close to the Serbian investigation was also quoted as saying "I still believe something happened there, but nothing on the scale of what has been suggested... and possibly not even connected to the KLA."
The European Union has set up an investigation, with a task force headed by U.S. prosecutor John Clint Williamson. Although, Kosovo and Albania continue to deny the accusations, on 2 May 2012, Albania drafted legislation allowing an EU-led investigation, which would permit international investigators to conduct the probe on Albanian territory. Prime minister Sali Berisha stressed that for Albania it is "a priority" to investigate allegations made by Dick Marty.
Medicus clinic in Kosovo.
In November 2008, several men were arrested after a raid on an organ trafficking ring in Pristina after a Turkish national, Dr. Yusuf Sonmez, was questioned by the Kosovo Police. Two urologists and a manager working in the private clinic Medicus, none of whom were qualified to perform surgery, were conducting an organ trafficking business at their clinic from 1998 until their arrest in late 2008.
Sonmez is also believed to have been active in Baku, Azerbaijan, where a local investigation found "citizens of various countries" were brought into the country for illegal kidney transplants. Reportedly, Sonmez was "involved" in the alleged racket, which also had operations in Ecuador. A group of four Ukrainian doctors were arrested in this case by Azeri and Ukrainian authorities. In addition, Sonmez, who has admitted to performing thousands of transplants, which he claims were all voluntary for humanitarian purposes, has been repeatedly arrested for organ transplants in his native country.
On 12 January 2011, Yusuf Sonmez, dubbed "Dr. Frankenstein" by Turkish media, was arrested in Istanbul. In September 2011, a Turkish prosecutor requested a 171-year prison sentence for Sonmez, who was charged with performing at least 11 illegal organ removal surgeries at the Medicus clinic, illicit organ trafficking, and forming a criminal gang. The prosecutor demanded the same sentence for the accused mediator, an Israeli citizen, Moshe Harel.
In another case, five (later nine) people, including the former Kosovo government secretary of health, were indicted on 15 October 2010 by an EULEX court in Pristina, Kosovo, accused of direct or indirect involvement in a number of non-lethal illegal kidney transplantations at the Medicus clinic. The accused are said to have lured impoverished people from Turkey, Russia, Moldova and Kazakhstan with false promises of payment for their organs. According to "The Guardian", the newspaper "has established that organs are believed to have been shipped to Istanbul in a criminal racket operated by Yusuf Sonmez, the same Turkish doctor wanted by Interpol for his alleged involvement in the Medicus clinic."
Prosecutor Marty's report (2010).
On 12 December 2010, a draft report from Swiss prosecutor Dick Marty to the Council of Europe was pre-released. The report alleged that the Republic of Kosovo's prime minister, Hashim Thaçi was the head of a "mafia-like" group responsible for smuggling weapons, drugs and human organs through eastern Europe. As stated in the report, the KLA held prisoners in a network of six facilities located in Albania, and Thaçi's "Drenica Group" had the greatest responsibility for the prisons and the fate of those held there.
"Some Serbians and some Albanian Kosovars were held prisoner in secret places of detention under KLA control in northern Albania and were subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment, before ultimately disappearing," the report says. A "handful" of the healthiest prisoners were presumably transferred to a farmhouse near Fushë-Krujë, not far the Albanian capital of Tirana, where they were killed for their kidneys.
The report states: "As and when the transplant surgeons were confirmed to be in position and ready to operate, the captives were brought out of the 'safe house' individually, summarily executed by a KLA gunman, and their corpses transported swiftly to the operating clinic." Some of the captives were aware of the fate that awaited them and pleaded not to be "chopped up". The organs were then subsequently shipped to Istanbul, Turkey.
Marty's report, entitled "Inhuman treatment of people and illicit trafficking in human organs in Kosovo", was presented to the Council of Europe Foreign Relations Committee on 16 December 2010, and was expected to be on the agenda of the Session of Council of Europe in January 2011. The report made waves across the world and led to a series of similar reports. The Swiss foreign ministry noted that Marty's report contained "grave accusations made on the basis of countless witness accounts and evidence."
Reactions.
The EULEX announced that they regarded the report very seriously and called for supporting evidence. On 17 January 2011, the EULEX Special Prosecutor's Office met with Albanian officials to discuss the organ case. UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier said that EULEX, which is now in charge of dealing with war crimes in Kosovo, was given every war crimes file that the ICTY and the UN possessed, including witness statements.
Kosovo's government has denied the crimes and criticized the report as "biased", "politically motivated" and anti-Albanian". Speaking at a press conference, Marty claimed that the content of his report was known to Western intelligence agencies, who deliberately chose to downplay the allegations for the sake of foreign-policy objectives. Kosovo interim President Jakup Krasniqi asked the EU not to endorse the report, saying "I welcome your support in not allowing adoption of this report as an official document of the Council of Europe." Former Kosovo prime minister and KLA commander, currently Social Democrat leader Agim Çeku, accused Belgrade of creating the allegations, saying "Every accusation against the KLA comes from Serbia or its helpers. It's just an attempt to blacken our war and our victory."
Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha responded by calling Marty "racist and antisemitic", while Albanian MP Shpëtim Idrizi alleged that the report "is something ordered by Russia and Serbia, and offers no facts. This is a story full of untruths and propaganda." On the other hand, Albanian former communist-era dissident Fatos Lubonja said it is important for an investigation to be conducted: "It matters not only for international justice, not only for the Serbs, it matters also for the Kosovo Albanians who have such leaders. If these leaders are criminals, if they face accusations of being criminals, they cannot create a democratic order."
Hashim Thaçi himself denied the crimes and his associates announced they would file a lawsuit against Marty. Thaçi also announced that he will publish a list of witnesses who contributed to the report that would discredit it, stating "There are witnesses and evidence which shows in what way the report was made." Thaçi's political opponents denounced the report and the accusations as "unacceptable". In 2011, Marty retracted earlier comments and claimed that his report has "never" implicated Thaçi directly, but rather his close associates. However, he added that it is "hard to believe that he [Thaçi] never heard about that."
On 25 January 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) voted to adopt a resolution based on the Marty report. 166 PACE members voted in favor, while eight voted against the document. Several amendments proposed by the Albanian delegation were rejected and the Council called for a full and serious investigation. The resolution calls on the international community and governments in Belgrade and Priština, as well as in Albania, to "undertake measures" in order to clear up the crimes.
On 8 February 2011, "The Wall Street Journal" published an article by Denis MacShane questioning the allegations in Marty's report. According to a former prosecutor in the case against Slobodan Milosevic, Sir Geoffrey Nice, the Marty report provides no evidence, no victims and a witness that does not exist. Nice dismissed the allegations as attempts to undermine Kosovo's independence.
In March 2011, Marty presented his report to the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, whose members said after the meeting that Marty did not provide any evidence, while some of them claimed that he attacked and accused of bias those who questioned his report. In a heated debate, Marty told the MEPs that a witness protection program was needed in Kosovo, before he could provide more details on witnesses to the trafficking as their lives were in danger.
Leaked documents.
In January 2011, "The Guardian" released NATO documents from 2004 that identified Hashim Thaçi as under the control of the Albanian mafia, in particular former KLA chief of logistics Xhavit Haliti. Haliti, who "serves as a political and financial adviser to the prime minister", was described as "highly involved in prostitution, weapons and drugs smuggling". According to the article, Haliti uses fake passports to travel abroad because he is blacklisted in several countries, including the United States. "Haliti is also named in the report by Marty, which is understood to have drawn on NATO intelligence assessments along with reports from the FBI and MI5," according to the article.
On 17 February 2011, the media obtained a classified document which suggests that the UN knew about the organ trafficking and the criminal involvement of senior KLA commanders as early as 2003. On 20 February 2011, Jose Pablo Baraybar, former UNMIK Forensics and Missing Persons Office head, confirmed that the United Nations was given confidential material about organ trafficking in Kosovo by an anonymous official. The statements, compiled in 30-pages, were made to the UN by at least eight "low to midlevel ranking KLA members". The documents have been given the name "CX-103".
Head of the ICTY Mission to Skopje and Priština Eamon Smith sent a letter to the ICTY Chief Investigator Patrick Lopez Terez on 30 October 2003, informing Lopez about Smith's meeting and conversation with UNMIK Justice Department head Paul E. Coffey. Smith presented his conclusions regarding the human organ trafficking case based on testimony by former KLA members. In 2002-2003, a number of ex-KLA ethnic Albanian witnesses from Kosovo and Montenegro gave detailed testimony about the revenge killings of Serbs and trading of kidneys, livers and other organs in the aftermath of the Kosovo War, taking place as late as the summer of 2000.
The witnesses reported that between 100 and 300 people were kidnapped in mid-1999 and transported to detention facilities in northern Albania, where they were held. Some of the captives in the 25-50 year age range were subjected to medical exams at given locations. The witnesses described how they buried victims to hide evidence of killings. The UN briefly investigated the claims but did not launch the probe, prompting accusations of double standards against the UN by Serbia.
Most of the victims were Serbs who were abducted in Kosovo between June and October 1999, the document stated. Those people were allegedly held at different KLA-run prisons in Albania and in some cases their organs were removed at a home set up as a medical clinic, where specialized equipment and medical personnel were in place to carry out the operations.
In December 2003, a top justice official in Kosovo, Paul Coffey, wrote to Jonathan Sutch, an ICTY official in Kosovo, that the crimes were reported to the UN in Kosovo by "multiple sources of unknown reliability." Coffey said the information was "based on interviews with at least eight sources, the credibility of whom is untested, all ethnic Albanians from Kosovo or Montenegro who served in the KLA." One of the witnesses is quoted as telling the UN that the first two organ harvesting surgeries were done "to breach the market", and that traffickers later were able to make up to $45,000 per body. "The largest shipment was when they did 5 Serbs together. ... He said they took a fortune that time. Other shipments were usually from two or three Serbs," according to the document.
A source said that the organs were taken through Tirana's International Airport Nënë Tereza to the Atatürk International Airport in Istanbul, and that workers at the airports were bribed "to close their eyes". Two sources said they personally took part in delivering body parts (hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys) to Tirana’s international airport. One source said he was instructed by his KLA superiors not to mistreat the prisoners and that he became suspicious when they were to deliver "a briefcase or a file with papers that would be given to the doctor when the captives were delivered" to the house in northern Albania, adding that he used to bring prisoners there but never drove any of them back.
Witnesses state that top KLA members and doctors from Kosovo and abroad were fully aware of the transport and surgeries and that they were actively involved in them. The sources also told the UN that the house where the organs were harvested was a two-hour drive from Tirana airport. The UN and ICTY investigators visited a house in the village of Rripë in 2004 and found pieces of medical equipment, medicine boxes and blood traces. Other victims include some women described as "prostitutes", of whom at least two were believed abducted in Albania.
Acquitted.
On January 12, 2013 Haradinaj and two other high-ranking officials from the KLA were acquitted from all charges regarding war crimes, including organ harvesting.

Elegy for Sam Emerson

Elegy for Sam Emerson is a novel by the American writer Hilary Masters set in pre-9/11 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
The novel tells the story of Sam Emerson, proprietor of an upscale Mount Washington restaurant with stunning views of the three rivers below. Emerson, at midlife and nostalgic, ruminates on his strange childhood as he faces the prospect of life without his much younger lover, and at the same time, deals with disposing of his mother's ashes and traveling to France to look for his father's unmarked grave.

Nate Parker

Nate Parker (born November 18, 1979) is an American actor and musical performer who has appeared in "Red Tails", "The Secret Life of Bees", "The Great Debaters", and "Pride". He was an All-American wrestler in both at Great Bridge High School and at the University of Oklahoma. Parker has been active in charitable work, donating his time both as a volunteer wrestling coach and a political activist.
Background.
Parker was born in Norfolk, Virginia, to Carolyn, a 17 year-old mother at the time. His mother never married his biological father, but did wed the man who gave Parker his last name. Parker has four younger sisters. According to a DNA analysis, some of his ancestry is from Cameroon. During Parker's time in middle school, his mother fell in love with Walter Whitfield, who was stationed in Bath, Maine, in the United States Air Force. Although his mother married Whitfield and moved to Maine, Parker, despite the physical distance after the move, remained close to his biological father emotionally. His father died when Parker was eleven, however. Parker became involved in classroom fights and home power struggles with his stepfather, Whitfield. Parker moved to Virginia Beach, Virginia to stay with his maternal uncle, Jay Combs, a former wrestler, at age 14. Nate's great-grandmother got sick and his mother moved back to Hampton Roads, Virginia and lived in the Churchland High School zone, where Nate joined her. Sharing a three-bedroom apartment with four uncles, his mom, aunt, and grandmother, Parker told "USA Weekend" newsmagazine ""we didn't have many material things but we loved each other unconditionally.""
As a sophomore at Pennsylvania State University in 1999, he and a teammate were accused of having had non-consensual sex with a woman who had passed out, but when she admitted during the trial to having had consensual sex with Parker the day before the alleged rape, Parker was acquitted in 2001. Parker married Erie, Pennsylvania-native Sarah DiSanto, whom he met while they were attending Penn State, in Erie's Frontier Park during the summer of 2007. He is a University of Oklahoma alumnus.
Athletic career.
Because Parker looked up to Combs, Combs was able to get Parker started in Wrestling at Princess Anne High School. Parker placed third in the Virginia High School League state wrestling championships as a junior while attending Churchland after reuniting with his mother. Carolyn Whitfield moved to the Great Bridge High School district so Parker could participate in its powerhouse wrestling program. He was a member of the 1997–98 state champion Great Bridge wrestling team and was a state champion wrestler who placed third in the High School National Wrestling Championships, while becoming a high school All-American. He earned a full scholarship to wrestle at Penn State University.
At Penn State, Parker was nationally ranked as a freshman. After transferring he continued to be ranked as a redshirt junior wrestler. In 2002, he placed fifth at the National Collegiate Athletic Association wrestling championships and became an All-American at Oklahoma. Following his fifth place finish, he was ranked second nationally as a redshirt senior. In 2003, he earned an undergraduate degree in computer programming from Oklahoma. After graduating from Oklahoma, he worked as a computer programmer until he was noticed at a modeling convention in Dallas, Texas, while accompanying a model friend.
Acting career.
Los Angeles talent manager Jon Simmons noticed Parker at the convention and talent search while Parker was waiting for his friend to finish her audition. Simmons felt Parker had "the look" and inquired about whether Parker was an actor or a model. After Parker denied both, he asked Parker to read a monologue from "The Fast and The Furious". He then asked Parker to videotape himself doing lines from "Antwone Fisher" and Parker delivered a video within a week. Simmons told him to move to Los Angeles, California right away. Parker packed his clothes and computer and moved to sleep on another aspiring actor's couch. He quickly landed a part in a television commercial. Bit parts and guest appearances followed. He has been working with acting coach Cary Anderson since arriving in Los Angeles. As of early 2008, Parker continued to live in North Hollywood, California with his wife, mother and three of his sisters in a one-bedroom apartment.
Parker played the male lead in "Rome and Jewel", a hip-hop take on "Romeo and Juliet" in 2006. He had a smaller role in "Pride", about an African American swim team, but one that allowed him to display his athletic physique.
Denzel Washington directed "The Great Debaters" and selected Parker for the role of Henry Lowe. Parker heard Washington requires biographies of the characters that he directs. He wrote a 100-page biography of the Henry Lowe character. To prepare for his role and write a character biography, he read the works of James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, W.B. Yeats, Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes. The character was based on the real-life debater, Henry Heights. Parker's character is the love interest of Jurnee Smollett's character and has a bad-boy streak. Parker also performed on the soundtrack. Parker, and co-stars Forest Whitaker, and Denzel Washington were nominated for the 2008 NAACP Image Awards in the best supporting actor category, which Denzel Washington won.
In "The Secret Life of Bees" he is the love interest of Alicia Keys' character. The movie co-stars Queen Latifah, Dakota Fanning, Jennifer Hudson, Alicia Keys, and Sophie Okonedo.
Public charity.
Parker aspires to provide scholarships to youth between the ages of 17 and 25 at Wiley College through the 100 Men of Excellence Initiative. He has been a supporter of Boys & Girls Clubs of America as well as a program called Peace4Kids, which is a program for foster youths and underprivileged youth in South Los Angeles, California where kids are involved in daily activities that stimulate and nurture creativity and intellect. Parker also coaches a wrestling team of 10-, 11- and 12-year-olds at Rosemead High School and he assists in coaching wrestling at Rio Hondo College. Parker was an active supporter of and volunteer for the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign.

Johannes Baptista Montanus

Johannes Baptista Montanus (1498 – May 6, 1551) is the Latinized name of Giovanni Battista Monte, or Gian Battista da Monte, one of the leading humanist physicians of Italy. Montanus promoted the revival of Greek medical texts and practice, producing revisions of Galen as well as of Islamic-influenced medical texts by Rhazes and Avicenna. He was himself a medical writer and was regarded as a second Galen.
Montanus was born in Verona, and became a friend of the pioneering anatomist Andreas Vesalius. He introduced autopsies as a means of acquiring anatomical data, and established the first permanent anatomical theatre, where Vesalius, Gabriele Falloppio, Hieronymus Fabricius and others carried out studies.
Montanus became a professor of practical medicine at Ferrara and at the University of Padua in 1539. His greatest innovation was to introduce clinical medicine into the curriculum as a way to integrate medical theory and practice. His students included John Caius, one of the most eminent physicians of the 16th century and a court physician of Edward VI, and Valentinus Lublinus. Lublinus was one of several former students who drew attention to their teacher's method by publishing his lectures and notes after his death. The new field of clinical medicine then began to attract students from northern Europe.
In 1545, he helped establish the first botanical garden in Padua. He died in Padua.

Taptu

Taptu is a social media and technology company that builds platforms, tools and applications that enable highly personalised creation, curation, recommendation, search, discovery, management, consumption and sharing of content across all personal screen-based devices, and most significantly on touch screen mobile devices, including phones running the operating systems iOS (iPhone) and Android. Taptu is a privately held company that was founded in Cambridge in 2007 and is backed by funding from Venture Capitalists including DFJ Esprit and Sofinnova. The company is based in Cambridge and Denver, Colorado.
In September 2012, Taptu was acquired by UK based Mediafed Ltd.
Products.
Original product.
Taptu's first product was a mobile search engine, provided as a website using html optimized for phones, and dedicated "apps" for iPhone and Android. It was closed in early 2011, with an announcement from Mitch Lazar stating the intention to focus on the news aggregation product.
Current products.
Taptu currently has two products. 
My Taptu.
Its flagship product is the recently launched My Taptu, a social news aggregator that draws heavily on the company’s mobile search heritage but attempts to move them beyond search. According to Taptu, the app, which is available on the iPhone and Android devices, is "aimed at solving information overload," or what Taptu calls "app hopping." It presents all the information that a person "is into" in a "one- stop app" through "streams," or what CNET describes as “content playlists.” My Taptu has tried to separate itself in the increasingly crowded social news space by offering various ways of personalizing and building My Taptu.
Currently, the app lets users add content through:
1) "Social Streams:" Users can add their Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn feeds to My Taptu. They can also add the feeds of select newsmakers or publishers that My Taptu has curated. Any time someone in a user's social circle shares a link with him, My Taptu will display a preview of the article and its source in the app itself.
2) "Single Streams:" One stream of content comes from one source, and runs all of the news or content coming only from that source. For example, a person can add "The New York Times" breaking news as a stream.
3) "Mixed Streams:" Combined streams are curated by topic. Content comes from a variety of sources. For example, the technology news stream could contain news flowing from TechCrunch, "The New York Times" Bits Blog, Read Write Web, Engadget, Gizmodo, and "The Wall Street Journal", among others. Taptu believes mixed streams put a story into a wider context, and help people discover content they might have not originally sought out.
4) "Web Watcher Streams:" Taptu has technology that it calls the “web watcher”, which allows it to watch websites that have no RSS feed and no mobile presence and turn their content into streams. The company uses it to fill out their fashion streams. 
My Taptu was released in the App Store and the Android Market on November 9th, 2010. It has received several positive reviews. and Apple promoted the App on its UK App Store front page by selecting it as a feature App of the Week shortly after My Taptu launched.
To support the launch of My Taptu, the company commissioned a series of online videos. The videos are designed to illustrate that My Taptu had a wide enough depth and breadth of content to appeal to any niche interest or passion a person has. One of its successful videos depicts the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, riding a “Boris Bike” Danny MacAskill-style at a local London skate park.
Wapedia.
Wapedia, Taptu’s other product, is a mobile Wikipedia service.
Management.
Mitch Lazar, former MD of Yahoo Mobile Europe, is CEO of Taptu. He stepped into the role on 20 October 2010, after spending 3 months as President and COO. Steve Ives, founder and former CEO, moved over to president where he remained until early 2011
Funding.
Taptu is backed by Sofinnova and DFJ Esprit, which bought out 3i’s investments in 2009.

WRAC (FM)

WRAC (103.1 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Country music format. Licensed to Georgetown, Ohio, USA, the station is owned by Dreamcatcher Communications.
History.
The station was assigned the call letters WIAO on June 15, 1981. On October 16, 1981 the station changed its call sign to the current WRAC.
WRAC was originally founded and placed on the air by Virginia Purdy as part of the Ohio River Broadcasting Association (ORBA). The studios started out with its creme and blue colors scheme, in a converted barn/garage on Virginia's personal property in West Union. The transmitter was placed on Spencer Mountain, roughly 10 miles west of West Union and one mile north of the pan handle. Gene Bowen (formerly of WURD provided much of the logistical help in getting the station on the air. The studios and transmitter site were furnished with state-of-the-art equipment. The station was one of the first in the area to originate high fidelity remote broadcasts using link backs by transmitter rather than conventional phone lines.
The first primary hosts were Virginia Purdy (afternoon talk), Gene Bowen (morning drive), Phil Swayne (lunch block), Ted Foster (evenings) and Dan Ramey (afternoons). Jeff Hall and Jeff Scott (King) joined soon afterward. Jeff Hall replacing Dan Ramey afternoons, and Jeff Scott providing engineering support, remote broadcast setup and vacation fill-in support. Jeff Scott later worked stints in morning drive and lunch block.
Gene Bowen, Jeff Hall, and Jeff Scott left successful previous positions at WURD to join WRAC. Gene Bowen, Phil Swayne, Jeff Hall, and Jeff Scott have since left the station to pursue careers outside of radio. (Gene Bowen has since died.)
The station started out playing an eclectic blend of top hits in pop, country, and adult contemporary. Bluegrass segments were later added on the weekend and subsequently to weekday evenings. The station was known for its community involvement stemming primarily from the founders interest in politics. Virginia herself maintained a tight grip on the public persona of the station by banning content that she felt was unacceptable for the public airwaves. At her request, the playing of the song "Jack and Diane" by John Cougar was banned, as one early example. She also hosted regular afternoon talk segments on relevant topics with the movers and shakers of the area. At her direction, the station, early on known as the bridge across the Ohio, maintained a presence at every festival and celebration in the surrounding Southern Ohio and Northern Kentucky markets. As Virginia became ever more involved in educational politics, her day to day influence and interest in the station began to wane.
Early on, the station had no nickname, at the strict direction of the owner. WRAC was always only referred to as WRAC in jingles and promos; never with any taglines or nicknames. Internally the "RAC" in WRAC was always thought to stand for Radio Adams County. Management felt this too restrictive and never permitted its use on the air. An early "on the air" promotion entitled "Make Maggie Moo" became so popular that when the station was later sold and the format changed to top ten country, Maggie remained to become the station mascot, and the station is now known as C103 "The Home of the Cow".
C103 now plays Top 40 Country plus top hits from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The primary on-air hosts today are Brad Rolfe and Rosie Young (The Brad & Rosie Show). The show has generated very high ratings in the past several years and is now the number one morning show in the area. Longtime afternoon host Ted Foster retired in April of 2010. This position was taken over by Matt Hilderbrand in May of 2010. Hilderbrand has since become a popular personality in the area. Rolfe and Hilderbrand also share hosting duties of "The Trash and Treasure Trading Post", a long standing call in show for the station.
C103 is the number one country radio station in Southern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. C103 now broadcasts in digital from a new tower and transmitter located in Russelville, Ohio. C103 studios are still located in West Union, Ohio. C103 is not only a country music radio station but also serves the community by broadcasting from area festivals, fairs, community events plus C103 has the best high school sports broadcast in the area. C103 airs over 150 Southern Hills Athletic Conference basketball games a year, as well as high school baseball and volleyball,
dirt track and NASCAR Sprint Cup racing.

The station is owned and operated by Ashland University (formerly Ashland College). The station's studios are located in the Center for The Arts building (formerly Arts & Humanities, or A&H). The transmitter and its antenna are located in the top floor of the library.
History.
WRDL began broadcasting from tiny studios in Founder's Hall in 1971. Originally at 88.1 on the dial, the 10-watt station's transmitter was located atop Clayton Hall, the tallest dormitory on the campus. Later the frequency was moved to 89.5 to avoid conflicts with other nearby non-commercial educational stations. In the 1980s the power was increased to 3,000 watts, and the station dial position was moved to 88.9. The transmitter was moved atop the new campus library building.
The station gets its call letters from the initials of Richard Dean Leidy, an adjunct professor that founded the radio/television department, at what was then called Ashland College. He led the department from 1960 to 1988, when he retired.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the station's music hosts included Tripp Rogers, Bob Spence, John Hager, Pete Moore, John (the Bear) Carroll, Doug Kurkul, Mike Parker, Michelle Temple, Tim (Shadow) Morris, Keith Connors, BJ McCurdy, Blair Mintz, Jeff France, and Ed Vogt. A Spanish-language show on Sundays was hosted by Jose Diaz. During this time, the station was called FM89, and later 89-Plus. The Sunday Night Special, which ran once a week for two hours, featured a different recording artist each week. Among the artists highlighted on the Sunday Night Special programs were Pink Floyd, Bob Seger, Todd Rundgren, the Doobie Brothers, Chicago, Yes, Heart, Billy Joel, Paul McCartney, and many other of the era's most popular rock acts. Airing immediately after the Sunday Night Special was an hour-long disco program, hosted by Adolph Santorine. The station also offered a weekly program featuring jazz, hosted by Mark Buchan. 
In 1993, student staff adopted the nickname "The Eagle," because it was easier to say than the call letters. The name references the university's mascot, the Eagles.

1937–38 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1937-38 campaign was like many recent years dominated by the club's FA Cup run. They reached their 5th and final FA Cup final, before losing to Preston North End at Wembley. They finished their league season in 15th place in Division 1.
Review.
Yet again, Town's season was dominated by their FA Cup run. They reached their fifth and so far last FA Cup Final. After a win over Hull City in Round 3, they scraped past Notts County and Liverpool, they beat York City in the quarter-final in a replay, before beating the favourites Sunderland at Ewood Park in the semi-final, meaning they would play Preston North End in the final, a repeat of the 1922 FA Cup Final, the only one of Town's previous final appearances that they won. The final at Wembley was the first since moving to the London stadium to go into extra time. The result would be the opposite to the 1922 final, with Town conceding a penalty to lose the match 1-0.
Their league form was pretty shaky during the season and they only guaranteed their safety with 2 games to go. Their wins at Leeds Road over Stoke City and Manchester City, the previous season's champions guaranteed their survival in 15th place.

Monte Rosa Hut

The Monte Rosa Hut (German: "Monte-Rosa-Hütte") is a mountain hut located near Zermatt at the foot of Monte Rosa (4,634 m) at an altitude of 2,795 metres. It is owned by the Swiss Alpine Club. The hut is the start of the normal route to the summit and other mountains in the area. The first hut was built in 1895. A completely new building was inaugurated in 2009, at an altitude of 2,883 metres.
Location.
The Monte Rosa Hut lies on the western side of Monte Rosa, on the place named "Plattje". It dominates the Gorner Glacier and is surrounded by many four-thousanders: Monte Rosa, Lyskamm, Castor, Pollux, Breithorn and Matterhorn.
The hut can be reached using the Gornergratbahn; from the station "Rotenboden" a trail leads to the Gorner Glacier. Then the glacier has to be crossed (usually marked itinerary), at around 2,600 m another trail leads directly to the hut.
History.
The first hut, known under the name "Betemps hut", was built between 1894 and 1895. It had 25 beds and was owned by the Swiss Alpine Club central committee. The hut was enlarged in 1918 to host 20 more people. The Betemps hut was offered to the Monte Rosa section in 1929 then transformed and renamed "Monte Rosa hut". Between 1939-1940 a new hut with 86 beds was built. The capacity was raised up to 146 in 1972 and 160 in 1984.
The new hut.
A new hi-tech environmentally friendly mountain hut was inaugurated in September 2009. The project of the Swiss Alpine Club, to mark the 150th anniversary of the ETH Zürich, was launched in 2003. The construction materials prefabricated elements were transported by train to Zermatt and 3,000 helicopter trips were needed to take 35 workers and materials up to the glacier. The five-story crystal - shaped building was built on stainless-steel foundations with a spiral interior completely made out of wood, the exterior being covered with a silver aluminium shell. The building is designed to obtain 90 per cent of its power needs from the sun. Excess energy is stored in valve-regulated lead-acid accumulators, which guarantee power even when it is overcast. The water is produced from melting glaciers then collected and stored in a large reservoir 40 metres above the hut. Bands of windows allow the sun to heat air inside the spiral building with the redistribution of thermal energy produced by visitors.
Over the next few years the hut will become a research station for the students from the ETH Zürich. They will use it to investigate how to use energy and resources efficiently.

Great Book of the Public Debt

The Great Book of the Public Debt (French: "Grand-livre de la dette publique") was created by the Revolutionary French Government in 1792 as a consolidation of all the states debts.
It was Joseph Cambon who made the initial suggestion for the state debt to be "rendered republican and uniform" and it was he who proposed to convert all the contracts of the creditors of the state into an inscription in a great book, which should be called the "Great Book of the Public Debt".
The post revolutionary government of Louis XVIII continued to use the Great Book of the Public Debt and it is an integral part of the Fourth Convention (Private Claims upon France) attached to the Paris Peace Treaty of 1815.

Almoloya del Río

Almolya del Río is a town and municipality located in the State of Mexico 26 km from the state capital of Toluca. It is located 2,600 meters above sea level. The name Almoloya comes from the Nahuatl phrase "almoloyán" which means place where water flows out. "del Rio" means "of the river" in Spanish and refers to the Lerma River, which originates here.
The town.
History.
While the area had been long inhabited by hunter-gatherers, the first sedentary farming communities appeared in this area around 5000 to 1000 BC. Almoloya was founded on the edges of the marshes of Lake Chicnahuapan. In the Pre-Classic period, agriculture intensified and tribal communities began to develop. By the High Classic period, villages with ceremonial centers had developed as well as the cultivation of corn, beans and vegetables on chinampas in Lake Chicnahuapan and the Chicnahuapan River, now known as the Lerma River. The village of Almoloya was founded between 650 and 850 AD by the Otomí and Matlatzinca people. The patron divinity was the Night Jaguar from the Olmec culture and the ceremonial center was called Xiutépetl Xaxalpa.
Mixcoatl conquered Almoloya del Río, along with Toluca, Tenango, Malinalco and Zoquitzinco. This was part of the expansion of the Tepanec empire which included many of the peoples of the Valley of Toluca. Aztec conquest came in 1476 under leader Axayacatl putting the town under the jurisdiction of Tacuba. Later, in 1521, Spaniard Gonzalo de Sandoval took over the town along with the rest of the valley, putting it under the jurisdiction of Toluca. The Franciscans came shortly thereafter to evangelize the native population, very likely building a small, temporary church where the current church stands. In 1528, the town was part of the encomienda of Juan Gutiérrez Altamirano, a cousin of Hernán Cortés, who had a hacienda named Ateneo. He also set up a hacienda just outside of the town of Almoloya. In the 16th and 17th centuries the town church, San Miguel Arcangel was built. In the 18th century, the town of Metepec had grown sufficiently that it became a jurisdiction, which Almoloya belonged to. Viceregal authorities mandated that Indians living in scattered small communities in this valley be grouped into four larger communities; one of these communities was Almoloya By 1808, the town itself had grown sufficiently that it had jurisdiction over three other communities: San Mateo Texcalyacac, Santa Cruz Atizapán, Santa María Nativitas and San Pedro Techuchulco. During the Mexican War of Independence, Ignacio Rayón's troops fought royalist troops in the fields between this town and Santiago Tianguistenco.
On 26 October 1884, 300 people led by Friar Isidro García attacked forty evangelists killing Pastor Landa, Nicanor Gomez and Nicolas Muciño.
In 1889, the town had a territory of 18 km2 and a population of 3,740 people.
During the Mexican Revolution, the townspeople's loyalty was split between the federal government and Zapatista and other revolutionaries. In 1913, Genovevo de la O. took the town's municipal president, Apolonio Vázquez prisoner and nearly executed him. In 1915, fighting between federalists and revolutionaries resulted in the burning of the municipal palace and the destruction of almost all of the municipality's records. A small portion was saved by Juan Hernández.
Between 1914 and 1918, a series of epidemics such as typhoid and famines struck the town, resulting in the reduction of the population.
Between the 1930s and 1950s a number of work projects began to divert water from the Lerma River to supply nearby Mexico City. This eventually led to the disappearance of Lake Chignahuapan. These works included an aqueduct and other actions such as dynamiting to divert the water to the city. In addition to the disappearance of the lake, this diversion has had seriously negative consequences to the Lerma River itself by blocking off the springs that feed the river. Overexploitation of these springs is also causing the dropping of water tables that will eventually cause the springs to dry up altogether.
By 1995 only 55 people spoke an indigenous language and by 2005, only 31 did. As of 2005, the town had a population of 7,992 people.
Notable sites.
The town church, called San Miguel Arcángel, is its most outstanding feature, built between the 16th and 17th centuries. It is dedicated to Our Lord of Burgos. The church faces west, towards where Lake Chignahupan was, with a view of the Nevado de Toluca. In the late 19th century, the stone wall to the north was constructed and its tower is thought to have been built around this time as well. Its bells were cast in 1947. According to sources, to achieve a better sound, many women of the town donated much of their gold jewelry. Many of the church's improvements at this time were the work of a religious fraternity called "La Agrupacion." The church has two side naves and one main nave, at the back of which if the main altar, whose age is undetermined. Above the vestibule is the choir, which used to have a large organ. In its interior are sculptures of the Archangel Michael, Saint Augustine, Archangel Gabriel, and four of Christ.
The Esmeralda Clock was made in 1926 in France with its base made in Mexico. It originally was located in Mexico City. It was given to the municipality as a token of appreciated for the sale of its water to the city. It was placed in its current position in 1940. As the town is located on the tallest hill in the municipality, the tones of this clock can be heard in the nearby communities, with many people using these chimes to mark their day.
The Parque Ecoturístico was inaugurated in 2007 in the marshes of the old lake. These marshes are home to a wide variety of species including a third of the bird species native to the State of Mexico. It is also a wintering ground for birds that migrate from the U.S. and Canada.
Economy.
As the principal economic activity of the town is the production of denim clothing, every year in September is the "Feria de Vestido y Costura" (Festival of Clothing and Sewing).Garments produced include rebozos, stoles and embroidered wool skirts. Traditional garments of the region, especially those associated with the feast of Corpus Christi are a specialty as well. Many of these garments can be bought at the weekly Sunday tianguis or open-air market.
Almoloya is known for mariachi bands that make their living at Plaza Garibaldi in Mexico City. The best-known of these bands are called "Benito Juarez" and "Miguel Hidalgo".
Festivals.
This town celebrates Carnaval every year in honor of the Virgin of Dolores. During this celebration, folkdances such as the "Paseo de Locos" (Parade of Crazies) los "Vaqueros" (the Cowboys) las "Pastoras" (the Shepardesses) and " Señor Santiago" (Lord Santiago).
This town is also the home of the annual "Biker Fantasy Fest," also known as the "International Camping Biker" which started in 1994. This is a rock-and-roll and motorcyclists' event, billed as non-violent and family-friendly. The 2007 event expected 50,000 people over the three-day event. This event mostly features Mexican rock bands such as Las victimas del Dr. Cerebro, La Dolorosa, Los Gatos (band), Congal Tijuana, Panteón Rococó and Maldita Vecindad.
The municipality.
As municipal seat, the town of Almoloya del Río currently has governing jurisdiction over only two other communities, Tecalco to the north of the main town and Texcoapan to the south. These two are divided into the following communities: Emiliano Zapata, El Calavario, La Puerta, Loma Linda, San Miguel, Duraznitos, Loma Alta, Florida (El Jaguey), Mirasol and Mezapa. Together the combined municipality had a population of 8,939 in 2005.It is bordered by the municipalities of Santa Cruz Atizapán, Santiago Tianguistenco, Texcalyacac, Xalatlaco and San Antonio la Isla. It has a territory of 6.44 square km. The topography of this small municipality consists of a hill of volcanic origin, on which the town lies, surrounded by smaller, rolling hills and the lakebed of the old Lake Chignahuapan. From here the Lerma River has its start from a number of springs that originate here.
On 26 March 1847, Almoloya del Río became a municipality. In 1854, the communities under its jurisdiction were San Pedro Techuchulco, San Mateo Texcalyacac, Santa Cruz Atizapán and the Rancho de Almoloya. However, its territory was reduced in 1866 when the municipality of Texcalyacac was erected and again in 1870 when Santa Cruz Atizapán separated.
The area has a rainy season from April to October and a dry season from November to March with a total annual rainfall of 871.7 mm. Average temperature is about 11.7C with temperatures as high as 18C and as low as 1.5C.
The principal economic activity, the production of clothing, is based on the town. Some handcrafts are produced including woven baskets for tortillas and flower arrangements. Outside the town, there is still agriculture, primarily the production of animal feed and corn on communal and ejido lands. Cattle raising is also practiced here.

Pyrus pyraster

Pyrus pyraster (syn. "Pyrus communis subsp. pyraster"), also called European Wild Pear, is a species of pear belonging to the Rosaceae family. 
This wild pear and "Pyrus caucasica" (syn. "P. communis" subsp. "caucasica") are thought to be the ancestors of the cultivated European pear ("Pyrus communis" subsp. "communis"). Both the wild pears are interfertile with domesticated pears.
It is sometimes difficult to distinguish "Pyrus pyraster" from a common pear. "Pyrus pyraster" can reach an age of 100 to 150 years.
Description.
"Pyrus pyraster" is a deciduous plant reaching in height as medium sized shrub and as a tree. Unlike the cultivated form the branches have thorns. The leaves are ovate with serrated margins. The flowers have white petals. The stamens are equal to the length of styles. The flowering period extends from April through May. The fruits reach in diameter. and ripens in late Summer to early Autumn.They are quite hard and astringent, but they have a sweet taste and are edible when they are really ripe and fall from the tree. The seeds ripen in September.
Distribution.
The distribution of wild pear ranges from Western Europe to the Caucasus. In Northern Europe it does not occur. This plant has become quite rare. It is sympatric with "Pyrus elaeagrifolia.
Habitat.
It occurs in thickets and open woods with cool-temperate climates, in lowlands, hills and sometimes in the mountains, at above sea level.
Wild Pears in Britain.
The “Wild Pears” of England and Wales are actually thought to be Domesticated Pears that have escaped cultivation. They appear to be archaeophytes, with charcoal and carbonised pips having been found at several Neolithic sites and are occasionally mentioned in medieval documents. So it is likely that pears spread to Britain after their domestication with early farmers and subsequently escaped into the wild.
Its establishment in the British Isles is probably due to human migration, with the trees belonging to one of the "Pyrus communis" subspecies instead of the "true" Wild Pear species ("Pyrus pyraster") which is native to much of continental Europe but absent from Britain. 
Another species of pear found wild in South West England, the Plymouth Pear is now thought to have originated from hedging plants imported from Brittany.

Foggerty's Fairy

"Foggerty's Fairy", subtitled "An Entirely Original Fairy Farce", is a three-act farce by W.S. Gilbert based loosely on Gilbert's short story, "The Story of a Twelfth Cake", which was published in the Christmas Number of "The Graphic" in 1874, and elements of other Gilbert plays. The story concerns a man who, with the help of a fairy, changes a small event in his past to try to save his engagement to the girl he loves. This leads to profound changes in his present, and he finds that matters are even worse than before.
"Foggerty's Fairy" opened at the Criterion Theatre in London on 15 December 1881. Charles Wyndham, the manager of the Criterion, starred as the lead character, Frederick Foggerty. Despite Wyndham's star power, interest in the play's bold and original premise and reviews that were at least partly positive, the play was not a success. It closed on 6 January 1882 after about 25 performances. Disappointed, Gilbert turned back to writing comic operas with Arthur Sullivan.
Background.
Genesis.
By the time "Foggerty's Fairy" premiered, Gilbert and Sullivan had already written half a dozen comic opera hits. Since 1877, however, Gilbert had not written a successful play apart from Sullivan. Gilbert wrote "Foggerty's Fairy" for British actor Edward Sothern, who had commissioned two earlier plays from Gilbert, "Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith" and "The Ne'er-do-weel". Sothern had not been satisfied with "The Ne'er-do-weel", despite various rewrites, and he refused the piece. He had already paid Gilbert for the play, and Gilbert was unable immediately to pay him back. After various discussions between Gilbert and Sothern, Gilbert agreed to let Sothern play his recent comedy success, "Engaged", in America and promised to write a new play for him.
In the autumn of 1879, Sothern was on one of his lengthy American tours. He intended to open the new Gilbert play at the Park Theatre in New York in the spring of 1880. "The Era" wrote in October 1979 that "It is proposed, during Mr Sothern's engagement, to bring out revivals of "The Crushed Tragedian", "Dundreary", and "David Garrick", the new comedy by Mr Gilbert being reserved for the spring engagement." At the same time, Gilbert was also busy rehearsing his American productions of "H.M.S. Pinafore", the world premiere of "The Pirates of Penzance" and touring companies to play these and "The Sorcerer", as well as British revivals of two of his plays.
On 29 February 1880 "The Era" reported: "Mr Sothern says that, although his new comedy, by Mr Gilbert, has cost him 3,000 guineas, he would not take 6,000 guineas for it now. It is a piece of the wildest absurdity ever perpetrated, and all the parts are immense." Obviously by that date Sothern had received an early version of the play and was enthusiastic about it. The same issue of "The Era" states that definite plans had been made for Sothern to appear at the Gaiety Theatre, London in "Foggerty's Fairy", as the new play was now called, in October 1880, after the end of his American tour. Sothern did not produce the play in the spring, and scholar Andrew Crowther speculates that Gilbert was late in completing it. In addition, Sothern had been ill for much of the time since the autumn, although he fulfilled his performing commitments.
Sothern came to England for a six-week holiday in June 1880, still planning to produce "Foggerty's Fairy" in New York. After one illness and a short European tour, Sothern fell seriously ill in the autumn. His health declined until he died in January 1881 never having performed the play but leaving behind a heavily-annotated copy. Sothern's sister, Mary Cowan, was the beneficiary of Sothern's will. Sothern's widow contested the will, and it took Cowan until 31 May to probate it. Gilbert contacted Cowan soon after Sothern's death and offered her his help. He suggested that she "underlet" "Foggerty's Fairy" to him for £525 and half of whatever he received for it until she had been paid 1,500 guineas. The play was first offered to comic actor J. L. Toole, but the deal fell through, and Gilbert next offered the play to actor Charles Wyndham, who was then manager of the Criterion Theatre. After Gilbert had settled these financial dealings with Mrs. Cowan, she wrote to him: "Allow me to say that of all the people with whom I have had any dealings in reference to money since my Brother's death, you have treated me with the greatest kindness & fairness & I feel grateful to you for sparing me any trouble or anxiety."
"Foggerty's Fairy" includes a mixture of several elements that Gilbert had used in earlier work. The main device of the fairy magic, which changes a small event from the past and leads to unexpected consequences, came from a short story, "The Story of a Twelfth Cake", which Gilbert had first published in the Christmas number of "The Graphic" in 1874. This novel plot elements anticipates numerous fantasy and science fiction stories like "Back to the Future". Gilbert slightly modified the story and renamed it "Foggerty's Fairy" when he republished it in his 1890 collection of stories and essays, "Foggerty's Fairy and Other Tales". Although this plot device is retained in the play, the plot of the play is almost completely changed. The device of transformation by supernatural aid is one of Gilbert's favourites. Gilbert uses it in "The Sorcerer", "The Mountebanks" and many of his other works. In addition, Gilbert used elements from his earlier plays "The Wedding March" (1873) and "Tom Cobb" (1875). In addition, several lines from the play appear in various Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The Ko-Ko, Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum exchange from "The Mikado", about lovers being too affectionate in front of another man who loves the woman, is used in the first act of Foggerty's Fairy. The "romantic" old lady, Malvina de Vere, is described as "having the remains of a fine woman about her", as is Ruth in "The Pirates of Penzance".
Productions.
By October 1881, Gilbert was rehearsing "Foggerty's Fairy" at the Criterion. At the opening night on 15 December 1881, Arthur Sullivan was in the audience. He found the play "ingenious, but unsatisfactory—like a dream". Audience reaction was favourable enough that Gilbert took a curtain call. The critics agreed that the piece was bold and original but uneven. The idea of the parallel universes conjured by the fairy was novel and intriguing but bewildering to audiences and critics, who were required to remember the original state of affairs and compare them to the magically transformed one. We are used to this type of story in plays and films today, but it was unprecedented and shocking in 1881.
Wyndham's performance was praised, and the play must have generated considerable interest: On 24 December, the drama critic of "The Illustrated London News" had not yet seen the play, but had heard that the play was "brilliantly successful, and will probably have a very long run; so there will be plenty of time to criticise it at leisure after the feverish pantomimic Boxing-Night week. I hear the "Fairy" spoken of on all sides as one of the wittiest and as the most ingenious and daring of Mr Gilbert's dramatic productions." Unfortunately, he never published his review – "Fogerty's Fairy" closed on 6 January 1882, before the next edition of his weekly paper. It was not a success, playing only about 25 performances. 
After the play's failure, Gilbert decided to concentrate on his work with Sullivan. Five days after it closed, Gilbert and Sullivan signed a new five-year agreement with Richard D'Oyly Carte to produce more operas together, and then they went to Sullivan's home to discuss their next piece, another work about fairies, "Iolanthe". "Foggerty's Fairy" still receives occasional amateur productions and rare professional ones.
Synopsis.
Act I.
In the Talbot drawing room, it is the morning of the marriage of Foggerty, a young pharmacist, to Jenny Talbot, a childhood friend. She will only marry a man who has never loved before because she doesn't want to "have a heart at second-hand". She was previously engaged to Foggerty's gloomy friend, Walkinshaw, but Foggerty informed her that Walkinshaw had been engaged to another woman, and so Jenny broke their engagement. Jenny's father, a "wholesale cheesemonger", and her guests do not much like Foggerty, and the best man, Walkinshaw, still bears a grudge. Foggerty has not told Jenny that he has another fiancée in Melbourne, Delia Spiff, a rich old woman who is a distant relative of Jenny's. Despite her wealth, however, he got cold feet and returned to London. Walkinshaw notes a newspaper report that Spiff has just arrived in England.
Foggerty is afraid that Spiff will ruin his marriage, but a fairy guardian named Rebecca arrives and offers help. Foggerty wishes that Spiff did not exist. She gives Foggerty a magic elixir that will change a past event in his life. Rebecca warns him that all the consequences of any event changed by the elixir will also be changed and that this may lead to unanticipated results. He promises to use caution. She also gives him pills that he can swallow before summoning her. Now Spiff arrives and claims Foggerty in marriage. Jenny calls off the engagement, Walkinshaw is pleased, and in desperation Foggerty drinks the elixir.
Act II.
Fairy Rebecca awakens Foggerty, and he finds himself in a different drawing room. As a consequence of the obliteration of Spiff, Rebecca has never met Foggerty before. He overhears Jenny's bridesmaids talking and deduces that he is about to marry Jenny. Malvina de Vere, a "stately lady of middle age and tragical demeanour" meets Jenny, now in her wedding dress. Malvina has previously had 18 lovers, all of whom had left her, though not before paying substantial damages in breach of promise lawsuits. She believes that her 19th lover is unfaithful but hopes that lover 20 will marry her. Jenny invites her to her wedding reception.
It turns out that Jenny is about to marry Walkinshaw, rather than Foggerty, although she does not love him. Foggerty sees Jenny in her wedding dress and tries to kiss her, annoying Walkinshaw. After Foggerty understands the situation, he tells Jenny that he loves her. She says that she has always loved him, but he never declared his feelings, and now it is too late. He understands that, in his earlier reality, he had come together with Jenny only as a consequence of fleeing Spiff. Foggerty roughs up Walkinshaw for stealing his girl, but realises the cause and is dejected. Walkinshaw and Talbot doubt his sanity. Meanwhile, Jenny overhears Malvina calling her lawyer, who says that her 19th lover is to be married later that day, and so she is free to marry her number 20. She mentions her 19th lover's name: Walkinshaw! Jenny terminates her engagement to Walkinshaw, throwing herself into Foggerty's arms. Malvina sees Foggerty and tells him that she can marry him now – he is lover number 20. Jenny faints, and Foggerty flees with Malvina in pursuit.
Act III.
Hours later, both return to Walkinshaw's parlour, exhausted. Jenny's father has called the doctors to report that Foggerty has gone mad. He instructs Walkinshaw to keep him there until he can be hauled off to the asylum, but Walkinshaw hides from Malvina. Threatened with a suit for staggering damages, and having lost Jenny, Foggerty decides to marry Malvina. He also explains to Malvina that he has lost his memory of the past. Talbot comes back with the doctors and Blogg, an asylum attendant. Blogg is instructed to stay and watch Foggerty but not to contradict him in any way. Foggerty deduces that Blogg is a policeman, and by the time he finishes asking Blogg about the crime that he himself must have committed, he thinks that he and Walkinshaw murdered the latter's aunt. Now he believes that he will be "hanged first and confined in a lunatic asylum afterwards". 
He summons Rebecca using one of the pills, but she is not his fairy as a consequence of the elimination of Spiff. After some blackmailing (he has 47 pills left!), he points out some inconsistencies in the consequences of the magic. He persuades her to restore matters to their original state, but without Spiff. She does so, and the scene is transformed to daylight in the Talbot's home. All ends happily, with Foggerty to marry Jenny and Walkinshaw to marry Malvina.
Critical reception.
The drama critic of "The New York Times" wrote:
"Whether the piece was successful or not remains to be seen. Opinions differ. The audience was not enthusiastic. It laughed and it applauded. A portion of it hissed, but this portion was a miserable minority. The farce is in three acts. If it were in one it would be highly entertaining. In three it becomes tedious... Unless set to music by Sullivan [Gilbert's] dramatic Bab Ballads are unbearable. You see all their ugly points, observe all their inhumanity.
The critic of the "Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News" wrote:
"The first act... is occupied in a very fresh illustration of a familiar subject. For the hand of pretty Jennie Talbot, the sentimental daughter of a wholesale cheesemonger, there have been two rivals, Foggerty and Walkinshaw... The... business-like air of the fairy, the incredulity of Foggerty, and the means by which a charm is made to work through a pill and a draught — all these combine to render this unique scene irresistibly ludicrous. It is, of course the very crux of the play, and if it were either misunderstood or resented the rest could not possibly succeed.
The spell itself and its consequences are certainly less easy to work out effectively than was the case with the famous spell in "The Sorcerer"... After this the fun soon becomes fast and furious — too furious to be in our judgment characteristic of the author's happiest manner. There is certainly a good deal of drollery in Foggerty's interview with Malvina de Vere, and their friendly steps towards an action for breach of promise. But there is almost too much of it, and there is certainly too much of the satire upon mad-doctors and their ways which occurs when Foggerty's friends believe him demented, and try to get a certificate to that effect from Dr. Lobb and Dr. Dobb. The climax, therefore, which is brought about when the hero takes a pill, summons the fairy once more, and brings matters back to their status quo, is very welcome, for towards the last the fun is felt to be flagging. The mad dream has been almost too long as well as too elaborate in its absurdities. This fault, if it be found to exist, can, of course, be readily remedied, as there seems no real need for the hero's false confession, à la Topsy, of a crime which he never committed.
It would be difficult to say too much in praise of the spirit, the appreciation, and the judgment, with which Foggerty's Fairy is acted at the Criterion by all concerned... But, above all, Mr. Wyndham's services in connection with the production are worthy of note. He has to keep Foggerty at fever pitch throughout, and yet never to abandon the tone of light comedy".

Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission

The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission was a non-departmental public body established to take responsibility for the child maintenance system in Great Britain.
The Commission’s primary objective was to maximise the number of effective child maintenance arrangements (private or statutory) in place for children who live apart from their parents. Under the 2010 UK quango reforms, the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission became the Child Maintenance Group within the Department for Work and Pensions, who now have responsibility for its functions.
Functions.
The Commission had three publicly stated functions:
History.
During 2008, the Commission began to offer information and support on the different child maintenance options available to parents. The Commission also provided an efficient statutory child maintenance service with improved assessment, collection and enforcement processes. The new enforcement powers were introduced from 2009/10. These changes aimed to ensure parents take responsibility for providing financial support for their children where they have access to them, or indeed do not. 
The Commission was abolished on 31 July 2012. Its functions were subsumed back into the Department for Work and Pensions, including responsibility for operating the Child Support Agency.
The new '2012 Scheme' is branded as the Child Maintenance Service and began limited intake of new cases on 10 December 2012.

Critical thermal maximum

Critical thermal maximum, in zoology, is that temperature for a given species above which most individuals respond with unorganized locomotion, subjecting the animal to likely death. This concept is particularly relevant in periods of aestivation or quiescence, in which circumstances an organism experiences limited mobility and lacks the ability to seek a microhabitat of reduced thermal stress.

Burton, Wiltshire

Burton is a small village with 96 households (March 2009) in the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in England. Kelly's Directory of Wiltshire of 1915 identifies Burton as the most important part of the parish of Nettleton. It is about 8 miles west of Chippenham.
There is a record of Burton dating back to AD 1204, and more recently in Book 44 - Wiltshire, of the Topographical Collections of John Aubrey 1659-70.
St Mary's Church.
The Church of St Mary the Virgin, which lies on the hill above the hamlet of Burton, is the oldest and most important building in the village, and is a Grade I listed building. The oldest parts of the Church date from about 1290 although little remains from that period. The Register of Incumbents dates back to 1305 when the Abbot of Glastonbury presented Johannes de Montacute to the living. The Manor and Advowson of Netlington belonged, until the Dissolution, to Glastonbury Abbey. The Church is now in the ByBrook Benefice in the rural deanery of Chippenham, archdeaconry of Malmesbury, and the present patron is the Bishop of Bristol.
The external walls of the nave and aisle date from the 14th century and in 1460 a general re-modelling of the church took place which included re-roofing the church, the building of the chancel and the erection of the north and south porches.
The 15th-century tower is one of a superb group to be found in this area, and has a western doorway over which is a quaint stone hood forming a shallow porch.
The north porch is richly vaulted within, and is surmounted externally by a panelled and battlemented parapet. On the cornice beneath are a number of grotesques to carry off the roof water : two at each side. A much-worn stoup for holy water is against the inner doorway. The door itself is the original one and still retains a large handle and escutcheon of the original ironwork. The door is fitted with a Banbury lock, which is the earliest form of church lock. This type of lock is one in which the lock's metal components are separately fitted into a block of wood which forms the frame. There are two keys - the smaller, possibly the older, is 230 mm long, and weighs 483 gm; The larger is 317mm long, weighing 858gm.
The south doorway is an early example of Early English work and has a curious canopied niche over the apex with flanking buttresses in which are carved two small human figures.
The priest's door is in the north wall of the chancel chapel, as the rectory is on this side of the church, and has over it externally a curious little projecting hood. Above the chancel arch is a picturesque stone sanctus bell-turret with panelled sides surmounted by a short broach spirelet with foliated finial. The ceiled wagon roof is tiled in Cotswold stone.
Inside the Church.
The earliest feature of the church is the circular Norman font, the lower part of which is formed like a scallop-capital with fish-scale ornamentation above.
The north aisle, which has three Georgian box pews, is a 14th-century copy of Norman work. The arches of the nave rest on the round columns which have sculptured capitals, all of them different. Here is a fine array of thirty or forty figures and faces below the roof and on the arches. Most are human, with a few grotesques. Some of them are corbels holding up the roof.
The bench table (stone bench) on the inside of the north wall is of particular interest and probably dates from the 13th century.
Most of the ancient glass was destroyed by Oliver Cromwell's men in the Fanatique Tymes, as John Aubrey put it, but some fragmentary pieces remain in the north aisle windows, mainly heraldic forms. They show Royal Arms, Scrope, Badlesmere, Dunstanville and Paulet among others. The families represented were all atone time or another associated with the Manor of Castle Combe though the Paulet arms occur all over South and West England.
The 14th century aisle terminated in a line with the chancel arch. When the aisle was lengthened, the original three-light east window with reticulated tracery was reconstructed in the present 15th century east wall, and the square-headed three-light windows inserted in the north wall, and two in the south wall of the nave. Arthur Mee's description of the Church in 1939 describes the nave as 'filled with box pews', but these have been reconstructed at some unknown date into pews of a normal height. 
The Royal Arms over the chancel arch, which by law after the Restoration had to be displayed, is interesting as it is in the form used by the Georges until 1801. These were the last of the Royal Arms to display the Arms of France in the second quarter.
The pulpit is of stone, with 15th century stone carving. The stone steps up to it are 600 years old.
The altar is crowned with a late nineteenth century reredos, which is a Doulton terracotta panel of the Last Supper by George Tinworth. The altar rails are 17th century with vertically symmetrical balusters. There is a heraldic wall monument beside the altar with marks of lightning on it, to Samuel Arnold a 19th-century rector for 40 years. Some restoration work was carried out in 1900 and again in the 1970s when a serious fire destroyed much of the work just finished. Repairs were again completed a year later.
In 2009, the pews and pew platform were removed in the west end of the church, and a new stone floor laid over the earth floor underneath. This revealed that one of the beams supporting the pew platform was very old, hand carved and part painted - possibly part of the rood screen that many churches had before the Protestant Reformation.
The church possesses several pieces of silver, including a flagon, chalice, paten and paten cover, most of which dates from the 17th and 18th century.
There is a First World War memorial commemorating:
and Rolls of Honour for the Parish and for Nettleton School.
There is a Second World War Memorial, commemorating:
There are several other memorials inside the Church, mainly of the incumbents and their relatives.
The Church Bells.
The tower holds six bells which were restored and rehung by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough on a new steel frame in 1982 below the old wooden frame, thus displacing the old ringing chamber. The bells are now rung from the base of the tower. The bells and their dates and makers are as follows:
Treble: Lllewellins & James 1889 3cwt 1qr 19 lb
2: A Rudhall 1754 4cwt 0qr 17 lb
3: T Mears 1830 5cwt 1qr 6 lb
4: W Purdue 1652 6cwt 1qr 4 lb
5: W Purdue 1653 8cwt 3qr 7 lb
Tenor: A Worcester foundry c1400 11cwt 2qr 11 lb
Tenor in Gsharp.
The tenor bell has an unusual border. Ornamental borders of foliage or arabesques between the words or on other parts of the bell are hardly ever found on mediaeval bells. The only other instances in an English Church are believed to be on the tenor at Hereford Cathedral (about 1450), and a bell at Bintry, Norfolk (about 1530).
In the Churchyard.
There are 24 listed monuments in the Churchyard. These are chest tombs with a Grade II listing. Also in the Churchyard is the war grave of Private Edwin Kent. The Wiltshire Times of 30 October 1915 published the following report concerning the death and funeral of Edwin Kent:
In the churchyard here are also the graves of Captain John Russell Compton Domvile (1856–1893) and Eva Kathleen Domvile (1868–1897), children of Reverend Charles Compton Domvile (1816–1898) who was Rector of St Mary's. This branch of the Domvile family is descended from Charles Pocklington Esquire M.P. who succeeded his Uncle Sir Compton, and took the Name and Arms of Domville.
Listed Buildings.
St Mary's Church is the only Grade 1 listed building in the parish.
Burton Farmhouse, now known as The Old Farmhouse, is situated at the bottom of Church Hill, and is a Grade 2 listed building. It is late 17th or early 18th Century. The Plume of Feathers, now known as The Old Plume, is also Grade 2 listed. It is late 17th or early 18th Century.
Other Old Buildings.
Another old building is Chestnut Cottage, which used to be the old forge. Also, part of the Old Rectory, now a private house, dates from 1605, although in common with the other old buildings, it has been substantially extended and altered over the generations.
The Causeway.
An evaluation excavation in 2005 confirmed the presence of a causeway next to the top (East-West) section of Church Hill, comprising several phases of stone surfacing approximately 2.6m wide, built on to a 4m wide bank of redeposited natural clay. Although limited dating evidence was recovered, the causeway appears to have been in use by the 17th century, and may well be Medieval in origin. The causeway seems likely to have been used until the construction of a dry-stone wall along its centre line in the 19th or 20th century. A possible early road surface extending beneath the modern lane was also identified and, although poorly dated, its construction and use appear to have been broadly contemporary with the causeway.
Travel.
Road.
The village is on the B4039 road, less than 15 minutes from the M4 motorway Junction 17, for travel eastward towards Reading and London, and about 5 minutes from M4 Junction 18 for travel towards Bristol and South Wales, connecting at Junction 20 north of Bristol with the M5 motorway for the South West and Birmingham.
Rail.
Trains from Chippenham station serve Swindon, Didcot, Reading and London to the East; Bath and Bristol and onwards to the South West; and also South via Westbury to Southampton.
Trains from Bristol Parkway railway station (17 miles) serve South Wales, the Midlands and the North of England.

Description.
Half-elves, as their name implies, are the offspring of humans and elves. Unlike Elrond and his twin brother Elros in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, half-elves do not have to "choose" between the human and elven worlds but are a subrace unto themselves, blending the features of human and elf. Half-elves look like elves to humans and like humans to elves (hence their elven description as "half-human"). They do well with elves, humans, gnomes, dwarves, and halflings, a social ease reflected in racial bonuses to the Diplomacy and Gather Information skills. In the case of conflicts between elves and humans, however, each side suspects a half-elf mediator of favoring the other. The drow despise them, referring to them as 'Mongrel half breeds'.
The main character of the initial "Dragonlance" series, Tanis Half-Elven, is a half-elf, as his name implies. In the "Dungeons & Dragons" Eberron campaign setting, half-elves consider themselves a separate people from humans and elves both and "breed true"; they bear the dragonmarks of Storm and Detection.
Half-Elves have curiosity and ambitions like humans but they have sense for magic and love for nature like their elven parents. Their skin is paler than human skin and they are taller and bigger than elves. Half-Elves have long ears like elves. They live about 180 years.
While creating a character in 3rd edition, a player can choose any class for half-elf. Half Elves, like humans, do not get attribute bonuses and decreases, so they don't have a favored class. Naturally, as elves, they have low-light vision, immunity against sleep effects and partial affinities for skills related to perception (elves have full skill affinities for same skills).
Like elves, a half-elf can become an Arcane Archer.

Sessility (botany)

In botany, sessility (meaning "sitting", used in the sense of "resting on the surface") is a characteristic of plants whose flowers or leaves are borne directly from the stem or peduncle, and thus lack a petiole or pedicel. The leaves of the vast majority of monocotyledons lack petioles.

Sessility (limnology)

In limnology, sessility is that quality of an organism which rests unsupported directly on a base, either attached or unattached to a substrate. It is a characteristic of vegetation which is anchored to the benthic environment. There are two families of sessile rotifers: Flosculariidae and Collothecidae. The circalittoral zone of coastal environments and biomes are dominated by sessile organisms such as oysters. Carbonate platforms grow due to the buildup of skeletal remains of sessile organisms, usually microorganisms, which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism. 
Sessile organisms such as barnacles and tunicates need some mechanism to move their young into new territory. This is why the most widely accepted theory explaining the evolution of a larval stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability. Wayne Sousa's 1979 study in intertidal disturbance added support for the theory of nonequilibrium community structure, “suggesting that open space is necessary for the maintenance of diversity in most communities of sessile organisms.”

Records, but went unreleased. The album's only single, which was the title track, peaked at #46 on the "Billboard" country charts in 2002. "Put Your Best Dress On" was later released by Steve Holy in 2004, whose version went to #26 on the same chart.
Although it was not released, Robert L. Doerschuk of Allmusic reviewed the album. He gave it four stars, saying that McCoy "fills this album with quality material and digs into it with some of his finest singing to date."

National Regifting Day

National Regifting Day is an annual observance held each year on the Thursday before Christmas. Many office holiday parties are held on this day, and research shows that 40 percent of office party gifts are regifted—that is, something given to someone and then re-given to another person without use.
On October 24, 2008, the state of Colorado declared December 18, 2008, "National Regifting Day," in an official proclamation issued by the state's governor, Bill Ritter, Jr.. Money Management International made NationalRegiftingDay.com and Regiftable.com to give people a fun way to learn more about regifting dos and don'ts, and to start the conversation on a topic many people are reluctant to discuss—holiday spending and financial worries.
The idea of regifting was made possible in a popular "Seinfeld" episode, wherein the etiquette of re-gifting is discussed.
Media references.
There have been several media references to National Regifting Day, including the following:

Sessility (zoology)

In zoology, sessility is a characteristic of some animals, such that they are not able to move about. Sessile animals are usually permanently attached to a solid substrate of some kind, such as a part of a plant, a dead tree trunk, or a rock. For example, barnacles attach themselves to the hull of a ship, but corals lay down their own substrate.
Sessile animals typically have a motile phase in their development. Sponges have a motile larval stage, which becomes sessile at maturity. In contrast, many jellyfish develop as sessile polyps early in their life cycle. In the case of the cochineal, it is in the nymph stage (also called the crawler stage) that the cochineal disperses. The juveniles move to a feeding spot and produce long wax filaments. Later they move to the edge of the cactus pad where the wind catches the wax filaments and carries the cochineals to a new host. 
Many sessile animals, including sponges, corals and hydra, are capable of asexual reproduction "in situ" by the process of budding.
Clumping.
Clumping is a behavior in an animal, usually sessile, in which individuals of a particular species group close to one another for beneficial purposes, and can be seen in coral reefs and cochineal populations.

Richard Rompala

Richard M. Rompala (born 1947) is an American executive currently on the board of directors of the Olin Corporation. He was chairman of Valspar from February 1998 until his retirement in July 2005. He had previously served as both CEO and president of Valspar. Rompala's leadership is credited with significantly expanding Valspar's international business operations, where it had previously been a primarily North American business.
Early life and education.
Richard Rompala was born in 1947 to a working class family on Pittsburgh's strongly Eastern European South Side. Rompala's steelworker father eventually moved the family to Ambridge, Pennsylvania.
In 1964, Rompala went to Columbia University, earning bachelors degrees in chemistry and chemical engineering in 1969. He went on to Harvard Business School where he earned an MBA in 1975.
Management work.
Rompala got his first management position at the Olin Corporation, running their flexible urethanes division. He left this position in 1979 to work for Victor Posner and eventually served as a senior vice president of operations at Mueller Brass. In 1985, he went to work for PPG Industries starting as a vice president of corporate development. He was eventually promoted to group vice president of chemicals and then to group vice president of resins and coatings. In 1993, PPG's chairman and CEO, Vincent Sarni was on the verge of retirement, and outside speculation suggested that Rompala was a serious contender to take his place. This, however, did not happen, and Rompala left PPG.
In May 1994, Rompala was elected president of Valspar. On October 30, 1995, he assumed the position of CEO at Valspar, succeeding C. Angus Wurtele in that position. He went on to replace Wurtele as chairman in February 1998, with Wurtele staying on Valspar's board of directors. Rompala's contributions at Valspar enabled them to increase their overseas revenues from 3% in the mid-1990s to nearly 30% by 2004. Rompala accomplished this by opening joint ventures in China, Hong Kong, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico.
In 1998, Rompala went to work on the Olin Corporation's board of directors, where he currently serves as the lead director and chair of the compensation committee. Rompala retired from Valspar as chairman in July 2005.

Eternal (film)

Eternal is a 2004 film about sixteenth-century Countess Elizabeth Báthory "repeating her crimes in modern day Montreal".
Characters.
Mark R. Leeper writes that "Néron's exotic lesbian vampire" in "Eternal" (2004) "is reminiscent of "Dracula's Daughter", though her assistant and victim-procurer Irina (Victoria Sanchez) is much less powerful than Sandor was in the earlier film".
Production run.
The film premiered in Canada in September 2004.
Reception.
Mark R. Leeper gives the film a 6/10, concluding that the film is "polished, sexy, and entertaining, and the art direction is its best aspect. But it is not a film that will stick with the viewer. It is too similar to films like "Jack's Back" (about Jack the Ripper returning) and several others".

Nyanzale

Nyanzale is a camp for Internally Displaced People (IDPs) in the Masisi territory of North Kivu province, Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Nyanzale is about north of Goma and south of Kanya Bayonga. 
It is a small town which population has more than doubled with the arrival of 20,000 displaced people. They fled in January 2007 out of fear of fighting between the rebels of the Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Rwanda and Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo dominated by Laurent N'Kunda's soldiers. They are also avoiding armed bandits that live in the bush. Armed banditry is a problem, since unemployed soldiers and a surplus of small arms from years of fighting are a bad mix. Unicef tries to help the refugees.

Dudley Noble

Dudley Noble, who started at the Rover Company in 1911 as a motorcycle tester and competition rider, became one of the British automobile industry’s pioneering publicists. 
He arranged one of the first ever promotional films to be shot, in 1912, of the Rover motorcycle production and testing, ending with a sequence of him accidentally falling off his motorbike in the middle of Kenilworth ford! Many of his Rover publicity exercises, such as racing the Blue Train, passed into motoring legend.
In January 1930, the Rover name hit the world press when a Rover tried to take on "Le Train Bleu" on its 750 mile run between Calais and Cannes. The idea of racing the Blue Train was very popular with motor enthusiasts, and each new attempt was received with varying expectations of success. Many had already failed on this mammoth challenge. The act to promote the new Rover Light Six in a headline-grabbing campaign was the brainchild of former motorcycle tester and pioneer publicist Dudley Noble, in which a Light Six was to race the Blue Train across France from Calais to St Raphael on the Côte d'Azur. It was a moderately shameless stunt of him, being safe in the knowledge that the average speed of the famous express was no more than about 40 mph once all its stops and detours were taken into account. To beat the train, Noble had to drive more or less non-stop from Calais to the French Riviera. The Rover Light Six averaged 38 mph on its 750 miles journey to beat the train's expected time of just over 20 hours, which gave the Rover team a 20 minute lead over the train. It had been beaten for the first time and the Rover team became celebrities through the ""Daily Express"".
In March 1930, Bentley Boy Woolf Barnato raised the stakes on Rover and its Rover Light Six having raced and beat "Le Train Bleu" for the first time, to better that record with his 6½ Litre Bentley Speed Six on a bet of 100 Pound Sterling. He drove against the train from Cannes to Calais, then by ferry to Dover and finally London, travelling on public highways, and won; the H. J. Mulliner-bodied formal saloon he drove during the race as well as a streamlined fastback "Sportsman Coupe" by Gurney Nutting he took delivery of on 21 May 1930 became known as the "Blue Train Bentleys"; the latter is regularly mistaken for or errouneously referred to as being the car that raced the Blue Train, while in fact Barnato named it in memory of his race.
