Kristyna Myles (born 10 May 1984) is a British singer-songwriter who is currently based in Manchester. Originally from Leicestershire, she came into prominence after winning "Busk Idol", a 2005 nationwide singing competition organised by BBC Radio 5 Live. Since winning, she has featured on albums by Chris de Burgh and Rick Guard, and has performed on television programmes such as "Songs of Praise", "Wogan Now & Then" and "Play It Again". She also supported de Burgh on nine dates of his European tour. In 2009, she was nominated for a MOBO award as part of gospel act DTWG : Desire To Worship God and has recently signed a five-album deal with Decca Records.
Life and music career.
1984–2002: Early life.
Myles was born and raised in Leicestershire. She attended Thomas Estley Community College in Broughton Astley before moving up to Lutterworth Grammar School (now Lutterworth College) at age 14. She studied Flute with Elizabeth Hextall {Black Rat} and later recorded the Black Rat track 'Jane' which was on the album 'Rich Pickings' Her first experience of the music industry came when she was 16 years old, when she was invited by Basement Jaxx to audition for the lead vocals in their single "Romeo". In 2002 she was accepted into the University of Salford, where she studied Popular Music and Recording and was in the same year as Manchester bands Delphic and Everything Everything.
2003–2007: "Busk Idol" and Chris de Burgh.
While studying at university, Myles formed a band and won a national songwriting competition. This led to her having her song "Thank You" released as a single in the Netherlands and performing in Amsterdam for the launch party. After graduating, she busked on Market Street, Manchester, before representing the city on BBC Radio 5 Live's "Busk Idol" competition in 2005, which she went on to win with her guitarist Ben Williams.
By winning "Busk Idol", Myles caught the attention of British singer Chris de Burgh, who invited her to record a duet entitled "Raging Storm" with him at London's Abbey Road Studios, for his latest album "The Storyman". Myles performed the song with de Burgh at one of his concerts at the NEC Arena in Birmingham in 2006 and on the television show "Wogan Now & Then". She was subsequently offered an opening slot on nine dates of de Burgh's 2006 European tour, which saw her perform in cities such as Frankfurt, Munich and Amsterdam.
Later that year, Myles featured on an Manchester-themed episode of the BBC show "Songs of Praise", where she performed her own composition "My Lord". In January 2007, Myles returned to the city centre of Manchester to help guitarist Andy Rourke and the annual charity concert Versus Cancer set a world record for largest group busk then, in April, performed with de Burgh and singer Aled Jones on the television programme "Play It Again". She released her debut EP, "One of a Kind", as a digital download through Roots Music Group in 2007, which featured four original compositions: "One of a Kind", "My Lord", "Setback" and "Sunshine". Myles also featured on the track "Sense of Purpose" from the EP "The Bells of St Mary" by British band Detours, which was also used on their studio album "Sense of Purpose".
2008–2011.
During 2008, Myles was the only unsigned artist to feature on the Universal Music compilation album "Songbird 2008", with "My Lord", a track from "One of a Kind". In July she supported Mick Hucknall on part of his UK tour, playing at venues such as Echo Arena Liverpool and in October she performed at Oxjam events in Lancaster, Lancashire, alongside Joe De Luca and Mike Dignam. During the next year she recorded a duet named "Making Movies" with jazz singer Rick Guard for his 2009 album "Anyone But Me". That August, Myles was nominated for Best Gospel Act at the MOBO Awards 2009 as part of the gospel collective DTWG : Desire To Worship God, but lost out to Victizzle.
Myles has been performing at venues and festivals across the UK and Europe throughout 2010 and 11. She played at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas in March and featured on BBC Radio Manchester in May.
2012.
Myles recently finished recording tracks for her debut album with producer Ken Nelson and announced that she had signed a five-album deal with Decca Records and that her debut album, called Pinch Me Quick, is due for release in September 2012. A first single from the album called I'm Not Going Back is due for release on 16 July.
As part of the build-up to the release Myles is campaigning to raise funds for British homeless charity Centrepoint. She plans to busk and fund raise across the UK and will be playing guest slots at Festivals like the Kew The Music Festival at London's Kew Gardens in order to encourage donations.
In June Myles will be supporting Ben Montague on his UK tour.

The village has a population of 210 and lies on the higher, left bank of the Pilica River, about 9 km upstream from where it now joins the Vistula. In the Middle Ages, the settlement's location on the western scarp of the Vistula River valley marked the then confluence of the two rivers, resulting in the village sharing the name of the river; however there is another small town also called Pilica, which lies near the source of the same river.
During World War II the area was heavily fought over and the village was in the front line for five months from the beginning of August 1944 when the Soviet army established a at Magnuszew on the west bank of the Vistula, followed by German counterattacks, until the successful Soviet breakout on 12 January 1945.

Walter von Bülow-Bothkamp

Leutnant Walter von Bülow-Bothkamp (alternate spelling Bothcamp) (24 April 1894 – 6 January 1918), Pour le Merite, Military Order of Saint Henry, Iron Cross was a German fighter ace from an aristocratic family who was credited with 28 victories.
Early life.
Walter von Bülow-Bothkamp was born at Borby, now a part of Eckernförde in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. He was the second eldest son in his family; there would be two younger brothers. All four of them would serve their country during World War I, with three of them dying in service.
Bülow-Bothkamp graduated from the Baccalaureate High School in Plon, Schleswig-Holstein in 1912. He then traveled for six months in Great Britain and Switzerland. After his "wanderjahr" he settled in to study law at the University of Heidelberg. He also joined a student corps there.
In August 1914, he and his younger brother Conrad joined Braunschweige Hussars Regiment 17 (the Deaths Head Hussars). In January 1915, he accompanied his unit to the front in southern Alsace.
Early Flying Service.
Walter von Bülow-Bothkamp was commissioned as a leutnant (lieutenant) in April 1915 and applied for pilot's training in the "Luftstreitkräfte" (German air service). Along with his brother Conrad, he trained in Replacement Division 5 in Hanover from 15 April through 15 September 1915.
Bülow-Bothkamp was originally posted to FA 22, which was an aviation squadron organized for aerial reconnaissance, observation, and direction of artillery on the Western Front. Although flying an AEG G.II two-seated observation plane, he managed to down enemy two seaters on consecutive days, 10 and 11 October 1915. He served with FA 22 until 14 March 1916.
After an award of the Iron Cross First Class for his victories in October, his transfer to FA 300 took him to the Middle East to continue his reconnaissance duties in support of a German ally, the Ottoman Empire. He flew on the Palestinian front and was wounded on 13 June 1916. In a letter home from the hospital in Jerusalem, he joked about his shoulder wound being as inconsequential as a dueling scar suffered at university.
After his discharge from hospital on 1 July, he won twice more near El Arish, with a fifth victory unconfirmed.
His courage and aggressiveness earned him a transfer to piloting fighter planes. He left FA 300 on 7 December 1916 and joined a Prussian fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 18
Fighter Service.
Bülow-Bothkamp shot down two enemy aircraft on 23 January 1917 and another the following day, to start his and Jasta 18's victory roll. By 10 May, when he transferred out of Jasta 18, his total stood at 13.
Appointed to Leadership.
He was then appointed Commanding Officer of Jagdstaffel 36. He promptly shot down two French observation balloons at Bouvancourt on 21 May. A hip wound kept him from scoring for a while, before he began a steady accumulation of triumphs that would extend from 6 July to 2 December. During this stretch, on 8 October, after 21 victories, he was awarded the highest decoration of both Prussia and the German Empire, the Pour le Merite. On 29 October, he went on leave until 7 November, leaving Hans Hoyer in temporary command of the squadron.
On 2 December, he killed Lieutenant Harry G. E. Luchford of No. 20 Squadron RAF when he shot down his Bristol F.2 Fighter. This was Bülow-Bothkamp's 28th and final victory.
On 13 December 1917, he was transferred to being Commanding Officer of a more prestigious unit, Jagdstaffel 2, Oswald Boelcke's old unit. On 6 January 1918, Walter von Bülow-Bothkamp led his wingmen into a dogfight against No. 23 and No. 70 Squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps near Ypres. He did not survive. RFC aces Captain Frank G. Quigley and Captain William M. Fry are believed to be his conquerors.
Walter was buried in his family chateau's cemetery. He joined his brother Frederick, killed in action in 1914. Within the year, Conrad would join them.

Głowaczów, Masovian Voivodeship

Głowaczów is a village in Kozienice County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Głowaczów. It lies in northern part of historic Lesser Poland, approximately west of Kozienice and south of Warsaw, along National Road Nr. 48. The village has a population of 780.
Głowaczów was founded in 1445 by a nobleman named Sędziwój Leżeński Głowacz (Nałęcz coat of arms), and later on, it belonged to the families of Leżeński, Boski and Ostroróg. The town with its two churches (one from 1390, another from 1445) was destroyed by Swedish invaders in the deluge (1655). New church was built in 1675, to be destroyed by Germans in 1944. Until 1795 (see Partitions of Poland), Głowaczów belonged to Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship, and in the 19th century, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland (1815 - 1915). In the second half of the 17th century, Głowaczów emerged as a local center of Jewish culture. Here, on February 15, 1864, one of battles of the January Uprising took place, and in 1869, the Russians stripped it of its town charter. In 1921, already in Second Polish Republic’s Kielce Voivodeship, Głowaczów had 2271 inhabitants, including 1411 Jews.
In September 1939, several skirmishes between the advancing Wehrmacht and the retreating units of Armia Prusy took place here. The village was partly destroyed, and in the spring 1940, all residents of Głowaczów were forced to leave their houses, as German authorities built airforce training facilities. Its Jewish residents were murdered in late 1942 in Treblinka death camp.

Bulk reading

For RFID tags, bulk reading is the extension of single reading to a set of tags. A group of objects, all of them RFID tagged, are read completely from one single reader position at one time. 
Limitations.
Bulk reading is a possible use of HF (ISO 18000-3), UHF (ISO 18000-6) and SHF (ISO 18000-4) RFID tags. However, as RFID communications address RFID tags responde strictly sequentially, the time needed for bulk reading grows linearly with the number of labels to be read. This means it takes at least twice as long to read twice as many labels. Due to collision effects, the time required is greater.
Principle.
A bulk of RFID tags has to be illuminated by the interrogating signal just like a single tag. This is not a challenge concerning energy, but with respect to visibility, especially in electromagnetic fields and using UHF or SHF dipole antennas. If any of the tags are shielded by other tags, they might not be sufficiently illuminated to return a sufficient response. 
The response conditions for inductively coupled HF RFID tags and coil antennas in magnetic fields appear better than for UHF or SHF dipole fields, but then distance limits apply and may prevent success.
Operational advantage.
Under operational conditions, bulk reading is not reliable. Bulk reading can be a rough guide for logistics decisions, but due to a high proportion of reading failures, it is not (yet) suitable for inventory management.
However, when a single RFID tag might be seen as not guaranteeing a proper read, a bunch of RFID tags, where at least one will respond, may be a safer approach for detecting a known grouping of objects. In this respect, bulk reading is a fuzzy method for process support. 
From the perspective of cost and effect, bulk reading is not reported as an economical approach to secure process control in logistics.

Gzhel

Gzhel is a style of ceramics which takes its name from the village of Gzhel and surrounding area, where it has been produced since 1802.
Overview.
About thirty villages located southeast of Moscow produce pottery and ship it throughout Russia. The name Gzhel became associated with pottery in the 14th century. Gzhel pottery was originally created by potters in their homes, however fairly early on these potters started to organize into workshops to increase production. The workshops eventually became a factory with pieces being formed in moulds and potters being responsible for separate pieces, a specific style, or decoration. The earliest pieces were created of earthenware. The pottery was painted solid white with distinctive blue designs. Pottery was also produced using a tin based white glaze and coloured glaze designs in blue, green, yellow, and brown, rather than just blue on a white background, in a style that is referred to as Maiolica. The body colour of earthenware varies depending on the raw materials used, and can range in color from white to brown. It is generally fired at lower temperatures than either stoneware or porcelain, and can remain semi-permeable to water until glazed.
Historical overview.
In the 1830s, the Gzhel potters developed a faience, or white earthenware, of a quality that rivaled the creamware being produced in England at the time. They followed the development of faience with the acquisition of porcelain. Porcelain is fired to a similar temperature as stoneware, but unlike stoneware it becomes a translucent white and as such is highly desirable. The making of porcelain had been a secret heavily guarded by China with only finished products being exported. When Russia was able to produce their own porcelain, it undercut the high cost of imports from China or Western European producers. Although there have been several periods of disruption in pottery production at Gzhel, quality pottery is once again being produced in both the recognizable blue on white design as well as the more colorful Maiolica ware.

Gniewoszów, Masovian Voivodeship

Gniewoszów is a village in Kozienice County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Gniewoszów. It lies approximately south-east of Kozienice and south-east of Warsaw.
History of the Jewish community.
According to official government statistics, in 1925 the Jewish community of Gniewoszów (Yiddish: גנייבושוב) was estimated at 2,530 persons. In 1933 across the Municipality lived 2,118 Jews. In 1937 the Kehilla was made up of only 1,662 Jews. The considerable drop in population numbers was likely caused by the migration overseas. The community owned a brick synagogue, a bath house, a cheder and two cemeteries, one at Oleksowska Street, and a second one at Lubelska.
On the eve of World War II, a total of 1,580 Jews lived in the town. Gniewoszów was overrun by the Wehrmacht in mid September 1939. Jews were ordered to wear a Star of David, and forced to perform slave labor. Before the end of 1939 Judenrat was established, with curfew and strict food rations. The Synagogue was turned into a German horse stable. The Jewish population began to grow sharply by 1940, because there was no permanent German garrison in the town and also, it laid on the Vistula, the convenient crossing point. Already by early spring of 1940 there were 2,750 Jews in the town (nearly half requiring food assistance), and by October 1940, the Jewish population exceeded 3,000. On December 22, 1941 a formal (open type) ghetto was registered by the German administration, and in spring of 1942 Jews from surrounding villages were forced to move into it. All men were required to shave their heads and beards. In August 1942 the getto was turned into a transit ghetto, doubling the number of Jews brought in from smaller towns (Ryczywół, Sieciechów) for the total of 6,580 inmates. On August 19–20 approximately 5,000 Jews were transferred to Zwoleń transit ghetto nearby. Around 600 were resettled to Lublin. The remaining 1,000 Jews were sent to their deaths in Treblinka extermination camp on November 15, 1942. No more remained.

Friedrich Heinrich Philipp Franz von Hefner-Alteneck (April 27, 1845 in Aschaffenburg – January 6, 1904 in Biesdorf near Berlin) was a German electrical engineer and one of the closest aides of Werner von Siemens. He is largely remembered for the invention of the Hefner lamp, which provided the measure of luminous intensity used in Germany, Austria and Scandinavia from 1890 to 1942. The measure was called the "Hefnerkerze" (HK). The Hefnerkerze was superseded in the 1940s by the modern SI unit, the candela.
He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1896.

Gzhel, Moscow Oblast

Gzhel () is the name of two rural localities in Ramensky District, Moscow Oblast, Russia, southeast from the center of Moscow. It gave its name to Gzhel ceramics as well as the Gzhelian age and stage in the ICS geologic timescale. In a broader sense, the name also refers to a cluster of villages and settlements in the vicinity of Gzhel and Rechitsy. An eponymous railway station on the Moscow–Kazan railroad has been operating since 1912.
Gzhel stands on the banks of the Gzhelka River, known from the 1451 charter of Sophia of Lithuania, mother of Vasily II of Moscow, as "Kzhelya". The year the village of Gzhel was established remains unknown; it was first reliably documented in the 1784 census. The village prospered in the end of 19th century; the 1871 census recorded 11 retail shops, 15 pubs, 5 inns, and 88 manufacturing shops. Farmland was scarce; most of the population made a living in ceramic trade or worked in Moscow. According to 1878 records, 952 local men and 177 women worked outside of Gzhel, yet the village provided employment to more than 1,200 workers from other places, evenly balancing the equation. Unhealthy work environments promoted mass tuberculosis among locals and guest workers; in 1909, the village built a privately funded free sanatorium for TB patients.

Cladocera

Cladocera is an order of small crustaceans commonly called water fleas. Around 620 species have been recognised so far, with many more undescribed. They are ubiquitous in inland aquatic habitats, but rare in the oceans. Most are long, with a down-turned head, and a carapace covering the apparently unsegmented thorax and abdomen. There is a single median compound eye. Most species show cyclical parthenogenesis, where asexual reproduction is occasionally supplemented by sexual reproduction, which produces resting eggs that allow the species to survive harsh conditions and disperse to distant habitats.
Description.
They are mostly long, with the exception of "Leptodora", which can be up to long. The body is not obviously segmented and bears a folded carapace which covers the thorax and abdomen.
The head is angled downwards, and may be separated from the rest of the body by a "cervical sinus" or notch. It bears a single black compound eye, located on the animal's midline, in all but two genera, and there is often a single ocellus. The head also bears two pairs of antennae – the first antennae are small, unsegmented appendages, while the second antennae are large, segmented and branched, with powerful muscles. The first antennae bear olfactory setae, while the second are used for swimming by most species. The pattern of setae on the second antennae is useful for identification. The part of the head which projects in front of the first antennae is known as the rostrum or "beak".
The mouthparts are small, and consist of an unpaired labrum, a pair of mandibles, a pair of maxillae, and an unpaired labium. They are used to eat "organic detritus of all kinds" and bacteria.
The thorax bears five or six pairs of lobed, leaf-like appendages, each with numerous hairs or setae. Carbon dioxide is lost, and oxygen taken up, through the body surface.
Life cycle.
With the exception of a few purely asexual species, the life cycle of cladocerans is dominated by asexual reproduction, with occasional periods of sexual reproduction; this is known as cyclical parthenogenesis. The system evolved in the Permian, at the same time that the Cladocera arose. When conditions are favourable, reproduction occurs by parthenogenesis for several generations, producing only female clones. As the conditions deteriorate, males are produced, and sexual reproduction occurs. This results in the production of long-lasting dormant eggs. These ephippial eggs can be transported over land by wind, and hatch when they reach favourable conditions, allowing many species to have very wide – even cosmopolitan – distributions.
Ecology.
Most cladoceran species live in fresh water and other inland water bodies, with only eight species being truly neritic (oceanic). The marine species are all in the family Podonidae, except for the genus "Penilia".
Taxonomy.
The order Cladocera is included in the class Branchiopoda, and forms a monophyletic group, which is currently divided into four suborders. Around 620 species have been described, but many more species remain undescribed. The genus "Daphnia" alone contains around 150 species.
The following families are recognised:
Order Cladocera Latreille, 1829
Etymology.
The word "Cladocera" derives via New Latin from the Ancient Greek (', "branch") and (', "horn").

Fennimore and Gerda

Fennimore und Gerda (subtitled "Two Episodes from the Life of Niels Lyhne in Eleven Pictures") is a German-language opera with four interludes, by the English composer Frederick Delius. It is usually performed and recorded in English, as Fennimore and Gerda in a translation by Philip Heseltine. The German libretto, by the composer himself, is based on the novel "Niels Lyhne" by the Danish writer Jens Peter Jacobsen. In neither German nor English is the libretto highly regarded; rather, the work is considered an "orchestral opera," limited in its dramatic appeal but voluptuous and engaging in its instrumental texture.
Delius began writing "Fennimore und Gerda" in 1908; he finished in 1910, but the premiere, intended for the Cologne Opera, was delayed by the First World War and did not take place until 21 October 1919, and then at the Opernhaus in Frankfurt. It was the composer's last opera.
Synopsis.
Two cousins, the writer Niels Lyhne and the painter Erik Refstrup, are in love with the consul's daughter, Fennimore. She chooses Erik but the marriage begins to break down as a result of the artist's drinking and Fennimore embarks on an affair with Niels. Erik is killed in an accident and, overwhelmed with guilt, Fennimore breaks off the affair. The rejected Niels spends years travelling before he settles down and marries his neighbour's daughter, Gerda.

Cincinnati Airport People Mover

The Cincinnati Airport People Mover or Underground Train consists of an automated people mover that serves travelers of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Opened in 1994 to connect Terminal 3, now the Main Terminal, with Concourses A and B. The system was constructed and was originally under the operation of Delta Air Lines.
History.
In September 1991, Delta Air Lines announced that a people mover system would be installed to connect their terminals as part of a major expansion undertaken in the early to mid 1990s. The system was originally announced as consisting of a pair of passenger trains, consisting of three cars seating a maximum of 71 passengers apiece for a total of 213 passengers per train. Constructed and installed by Otis, at the time of its construction this $16.7 million facility was only the sixth of its kind installed by Otis throughout the world. The train would be inaugurated on following a dedication ceremony on June 9, 1994. In 2010, after Delta cut back on flights, the train skipped Concourse A station, and went between Terminal 3 (now the Main Terminal) and Concourse B. Since the closing of Terminal 2, the train makes 3 stops: Main Terminal, Concourse A and Concourse B round-trip. Today, the train handles up to 500 round trips. Trains departs every 90 seconds.

European route E33

European route E 33 is a series of roads in Italy, part of the United Nations International E-road network. 
It runs from Parma to La Spezia, both in Italy.
It leaves Parma, where it links to E 35 and heads south-west, reaching its destination of La Spezia, where it further links to E 80, a transcontinental route. The is therefore exactly the same route as the Italian A15.
In practice, the number E 33 does not appear on any road signs. Instead, its entire stretch is signposted as E 31, creating a duplication with the E 31 in Germany and the Netherlands. This goes back to the numbering set forth in the original European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries (AGR) of 1975, in which Parma - La Spezia was numbered E 31 and Rotterdam - Ludwigshafen was numbered E 33. These numbers were swapped upon the AGR's entry into force in 1985, apparently resulting from the fact that the Parma - La Spezia route is entirely situated east of the Rotterdam - Ludwigshafen route so that the former should under AGR principles have a number above the former. This numbering change, however, never made it onto Italian signs.

Anti-fashion

Anti-fashion is an umbrella term for various styles of dress which are explicitly contrary to the fashion of the day. Anti-fashion styles may represent an attitude of indifference or may arise from political or practical goals which make fashion a secondary priority. The term is sometimes even used for styles championed by high profile designers, when they encourage or create trends that do not follow the mainstream fashion of the time. Another example, this time from the early 20th century, was promoted by the legendary designer Gabrielle Chanel - a "poor girl" woman's style where rich ladies could look like regular women while still dressing in clothes that showed their quality under close inspection.
Grunge is an example of the oppositional style of dress while the rational dress of the Victorian era, which allowed ladies to swim or bicycle, is an example of a functional anti-fashion. A trend for feminist women to dress in ways that do not follow the norms for women's clothing has been described as anti-fashion, though research suggested many women who dress this way do not choose to label themselves this way, in the opinion of author Samantha Holland this is because the women do not like the confrontational overtones of the term. In the 1990s a minimalist style described as anti fashion emerged on both sides of the Atlantic where young people would typically wear simple clothes such as black jeans and white t-shirts without a visible brand name.
The dress sense of the Charles, Prince of Wales has been described as anti fashion, in that it reflects indifference to current fashion in favour of traditional style. Simple Fashion adopted by Hardcore Punks in the '80s. At its strictest it consists of a plain white t-shirt, black trousers or plain jeans and black boots. Hair is cut short. This anti fashion was adopted in response to the 'overly fashion conscious' fans of bands such as the Sex Pistols.

The village has a population of 4.

His parents owned an estate in Zegrzynek (practically the entire settlement), with the manor visited by writers such as Maria Konopnicka and Konrad Prószyński. It was nationalized by the communists after the war. It is widely assumed that it was Jerzy's wife, Anita Szaniawska ("née" Szatkowska) who set Szaniawskis country manor on fire in 1977, causing not only its total destruction, but also the death of two squatters locked inside. She died in a mental hospital.

Łajski

Łajski - is a village located in Poland in Masovian Voivodeship in the Legionowo County, in the Gmina Wieliszew.
In the years 1975-1998 the area was the province of Warsaw Voivodeship.
Location of the town.
Łajski is located around the Warsaw Basin. It has densely wooded areas which are the northern stretch of the Pomiechowskie Forests, and in its south-eastern part are the remains of the Nieporęckiej Forest. The landscape is gently undulating plain, and the surrounding hills reach 75–85 m.
The village has about 1,300 inhabitants. Łajski lies in close proximity to Legionowo, 16 km from the center of Warsaw, with routes connecting to Warsaw and Gdansk (by railway) and the Masurian Lake District (national road No. 61). Less than 7 km away is the village of Zegrze Reservoir, which is summer relaxation destination for the inhabitants of greater Warsaw.
Łajski was formed as a result of administrative changes in 1973 and is bordered by the municipality Wieliszew and near Skrzeszew, Wieliszew and Michałów-Reginowem.
Soil.
Most sands here are mixed with clay, limestone and in the deep parts, small bands of carbon.
History of the village.
Łajski is within the territory of greater Warsaw, and consists of land formerly contained within the three historical administrative units in the ducal fief of Mazovia - the land of Warsaw, Zakroczymska and Sochaczewska. When the Crown took over, they entered into the voivodeship as part of the districts of Warsaw, Zakroczymskiego, Serocki and Sochaczew.
In 1795, these areas came under Prussian rule. In the nineteenth century most of the area fell within the precinct of Warsaw province, and only in 1952, was separated from a separate district - Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki.
In terms of church administration, the area belonged to the late eleventh century to the Diocese of Plock. In 1978 it joined the Archdiocese of Warsaw, and from 1995 Łajski became part of the Diocese of Warsaw-Praga. The diocese was founded March 25, 1992 under the edict of Pope John Paul II.
Łajski as a village was recorded in the land register as property of Count Potocki Augusta. Named after an owner Łajsk, said to be a colorful figure in those days, a Polish activist who in 1886 was one of the founders and first president of the Warsaw Society of Cyclists. The count was also the founder, in 1897, of a glass works.
In September 1939, the Army stopped the Nazi invaders in the line of the Narew, defended by an army of Modlin.
The occupation led to a further administrative divisions with the area being subordinate to the Governor General of the German Reich.
An offensive resulted in destruction in 1944. The most fierce battles betwen the Red Army against the German army brought immense destruction of buildings in Łajski. The proximity to the Modlin Fortress, around which took place the fiercest battles, made it necessary to start post-war redevelopment of the town from scratch.
Within Łajsk there are several archaeological sites, where the remains of the former residents of this area from different eras were found. The major findings include the excavation of the Hallstatt culture of the period possibly from the Iron Age. H. Hildebrand discovered it in 1874 and it's now accepted that the Hallstatt period were in the years 700-400 BC.
22 archaeological sites have been discovered: tombs, graves with cover, ash pan graves, pit graves, and more. One of the most interesting discoveries were urns - usually an earthen vessel, which serves to store the ashes of the deceased, which is characteristic for the cultures which used a certain funeral rite. These findings confirm the continuity of settlement in the village and surrounding areas.
Economy.
Mechanical Plant "Horseshoe" Poniatów
From 1933-1943 at the border between Łajski and Poniatów (today Michałów-Reginów) operated the Mechanical Plant "horseshoe" Poniatów. The first months of operation the plant was limited mainly to the production of horseshoes.
In later years, the range of products was constantly changing, studs were fixed and were the primary product of the plant. With time, they started to produce motorcycles.
Establishments and public places
Education.
There is an elementary school with a policy of inclusive education, integration in the classroom, teaching children with different disabilities, and having a decision on disability. Children with disabilities benefit from the help of many experts, i.e. assistants of disabled children, sensory integration therapist, psychologists, counselors, counselors for music therapy, art therapy and dogotherapy.
Since September 2008 there is a class in the school brass band, in which classes are conducted by graduates of the Academy of Music.

Macrolane

Macrolane is a body-contour filler marketed by Q-Med in the UK since early 2008. It claims to be a less invasive alternative to surgical breast enlargement, offering an increase of one cup size through injections that take between 30 and 90 minutes - colloquially referred to as the "30 minute boob job".
More recently, Q-Med have discontinued promoting Macrolane as a breast enhancer due to the lack of consensus amongst radiologists regarding how to examine breasts that have been injected with filler.
Procedure.
The treatment involves injecting stabilised hyaluronic acid into the breast, buttock or other areas, and then moulding to the desired shape. The procedures requires a local anaesthetic, and will likely cause bruising, swelling and discomfort for a few days. The effect only lasts for 12 months, after which further injections are required.
Criticisms.
The procedure has drawn criticism as its long-term effects are relatively unknown. In 2009 the journalist Alice Hart-Davis described the problems that she experienced after having the procedure. The only medical trial was supported by the manufacturers, involving 1000 patients in Japan, and anybody taking the procedure will be entered into a European-wide research trial.
Initially, treatment in the UK was reasonably expensive, costing about £3000 for the initial injections, followed by £1400 for repeat injections each year in order to maintain the effect. The cost of treatment declined to around £2000 for initial injections as its popularity grew.
In Sweden there has recently been a number of cases of erection problems and pain associated with erection when injections were used to increase penis size, prompting a mandatory investigation into the safety of the product.

1,1,3,3-Tetramethylguanidine

Tetramethylguanidine is an organic compound with the formula HNC(N(CH3)2)2. This colourless liquid is a strong base with a higher pKa than typical amines. 
It was originally prepared from tetramethylthiourea via "S"-methylation and amination, but alternative methods start from cyanogen iodide.
Uses.
TMG is mainly used as a strong, non-nucleophilic base for alkylations, often as a substitute for the more expensive bases DBU and DBN. Since it is highly water soluble, it is easily removed from mixtures in organic solvents. It is also used as a base-catalyst in the production of polyurethane.

Yanina Batyrchina

Yana (Yanina) Batyrshina (, born October 7, 1979) is a former individual rhythmic gymnast who competed for Russia. She is the 1996 Olympics All-around silver medalist, two time (1995,1997) World All-around bronze medalist, the 1996 European All-around silver medalist and 1996 Grand Prix Final All-around champion.
Personal life.
Yana Batyrshina is of Jewish and Tatar descent. She studied physical education at the Kharkov Institute.
Career.
Batyrshina started training at five years old when a rhythmic gymnast coach approached her father and told the family she was ideal gymnastics material. At 9 years of age, Batyrchina moved to Russia with Irina Viner who became the Russian National Team Head coach.
Batyrchina burst onto the International scene in 1993, when she finished 2nd all-around at the European Junior Championships, she also won gold in the individual apparatus finals with rope and clubs, and silver with ball and ribbon.
In 1995, Batyrshina made her senior international breakthrough in Grand Prix events, collecting a total of 15 medals. At the 1995 World Championships she won the bronze medal in All-around and also took home golds for the team competition and ball. Her results fluctuated in 1996, but she still managed ton take the silver medal for the all-around and ball at the 1996 European Championships. After the event final of 1996 World Championships, she won the silver medal in ribbon.
Batyrshina competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics, but she had a rough start at the preliminaries. She wept bitterly after several errant catches left her sitting in 13th place in preliminaries but since the top 20 advanced to semifinals, she redeemed her poor preliminary results and set her up perfectly for finals. But during her last event exercise, ribbon, she lost focus in the midst of a simple hand-to-hand exchange and dropped the apparatus. Batyrshina was scored 9.683, putting her into second place overall ahead of Ukrainian Olena Vitrichenko.
Batyrchina polished off her 1996 season with a win in All-around at the 1996 Grand Prix Final (tied with Yekaterina Serebrianskaya), a huge coup considering the depth of the field. She parlayed her success into a medal-winning 1997, including several Grand Prix golds. Despite her success and desire to continuing competing through the 2000 Olympics, 1998 presented a new challenge for Batyrshina in the form of up and coming new Russian teammate Alina Kabayeva. Kabayeva would go on to win the 1998 European Championships, while Batyrshina would struggle with ribbon and finish third in All-around. Batyrshina picked up three more medals in apparatus finals with a gold in rope, silver with hoop, and bronze with ribbon but, according to coach Viner, Batyrshina was beginning to feel that there was not enough room for both her and Kabayeva at the top. Batyrshina quietly retired a short time after Europeans at 19 years of age.
After her retirement, Batyrshina began coaching. In 1999, she was briefly invited to serve as a trainer at the UNOPAR gym in Londrina, Brazil, helping prepare the Brazilian group for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.
Influence.
Yanina Batyrshina is arguably one of the most popular rhythmic gymnast of her decade. Her winning style has altered the direction of rhythmic gymnastics in Russia as well as the rest of the world. Well known for her undeniable flexibility and personality, Batyrchina was also hailed for a top-notch level of difficulty and high, oversplit leaps and jumps. She included many flexibility skills in her routines, the majority of which highlighted her spectacularly elastic back.

Following the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, the republics of Serbia and Montenegro together established a federation as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). In 2003 the FRY was reconstituted as a state union officially known as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The British Ambassador to Serbia was also accredited to Montenegro. The union was dissolved in June 2006 when Serbia and Montenegro declared themselves independent countries, and a British embassy was then established in Podgorica.

Robert Kellard

Robert Kellard (April 23, 1915–January 13, 1981) was an American actor who appeared in over 60 films between 1937 and 1951.
Career.
Kellard entered in Hollywood in 1937 in the film "Annapolis Salute", directed by Christy Cabanne. After that, he bounced back and forth from starring roles in low-budget films like "Island in the Sky", "Time Out for Murder", "While New York Sleeps", and supporting roles in "Boy Friend" and "Here I Am a Stranger", until he found the time to make two serials for Republic Pictures. 
Although third billed, Kellard was ostensibly the hero in Republic’s adaptation of Sax Rohmer’s "Drums of Fu Manchu".

List of The Secret Saturdays episodes

"The Secret Saturdays" is an animated television series that aired on Cartoon Network in most countries and on Teletoon in Canada. The episodes are directed by Scott Jeralds and produced by PorchLight Entertainment. The series debuted on Cartoon Network on October 3, 2008.
The series concentrates on the adventures of the Saturdays, a family of cryptozoologists who work to keep the truth about cryptids from getting out in order to protect the human race and the creatures themselves. The Saturdays travel the world searching for cryptids to study and battling twisted villains like the megalomaniac V.V. Argost. The series is influenced by the style of 1960s-era Hanna-Barbera action series (such as "Jonny Quest"), and is combined with creator Jay Stephens's own personal interest in cryptozoology.
The first season has 26 episodes and is focused primarily on the Saturdays' search for an ancient Sumerian cryptid called Kur, who has the power to control an army of cryptids. At the end of the season finale, it was revealed that Kur was none other than Zak Saturday, a fact of which not even Zak was aware. On November 7, 2009, a second season containing 10 episodes aired to follow up on the cliffhanger ending. It featured a self-contained story arc focused on Zak and his family dealing with the revelation of Zak being Kur and the consequences of that knowledge. The series ended on February 27, 2010. Contrary to what many people believe, there are only two, not three, seasons.

Shopping in Leeds

Most of the retail activity in Leeds, northern England, is contained within central Leeds. The city centre has attracted many upmarket retailers in recent years, including Harvey Nichols, leading to Leeds being dubbed 'Knightsbridge of the North'.
City centre.
The Shopping Quarter of Leeds city centre is the area which traditionally extended south from The Headrow to Boar Lane, but now extends north of The Headrow through the St. Johns, Merrion and The Light shopping centres. Most of the city's major shops are located north of Boar Lane and south of the Merrion Centre. Like any major city, the shopping district is home to both major international chains, including Marks & Spencer (founded in 1894 on a small stall at the city's market), and independent shops. The Corn Exchange has traditionally championed many of these shops and since a refurbishment in 2007–08, re-opened as a boutique shopping destination. The entire lower-ground level is now occupied by a new restaurant, the Piazza by Anthony, which has been followed by a growing number of independent fashion boutiques and creative enterprises, including Hidden Wardrobe and Outrage.
Most streets in the Shopping Quarter are connected to Briggate. It is one of many of the main shopping streets and is also home to several national and international food chains.
Briggate is one of Leeds' main shopping streets, the other being The Headrow. In the 1960s The Merrion Centre was constructed to provide the city centre with modern shopping facilities away from the increasingly busy roads.
Leeds city centre has many shopping centres including:
The city also boasts many Victorian shopping arcades, particularly around Briggate. The Victoria Quarter is made up of shopping arcades.
Pedestrianisation
Much of the shopping areas of Leeds city centre have been pedestrianised. Briggate, Lands Lane, Albion Place, Bond Street, Commercial Street, King Edwards and Kirkgate (from Briggate to Vicar Lane) have all been pedestrianised.
Markets 
There are two markets in Leeds city centre. The main one is Leeds City Market, named Kirkgate Market locally, on Vicar Lane which is made up of several halls built at different times over the last century. It is Europe's largest covered market. There is also a smaller outdoor trading area at Kirkgate Market. The original markets where Michael Marks started his Penny Bazaar, which became Marks and Spencer were located near to City Square.
There are the smaller Merrion Markets in The Merrion Centre which are significantly smaller than those of Vicar Lane.
There are regular Sunday Farmers Markets on Briggate and an annual Christmas Market in Millennium Square.

Solec nad Wisłą

Solec nad Wisłą is a village in Lipsko County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Solec nad Wisłą. It lies approximately east of Lipsko and south-east of Warsaw. The village has a population of 1,650, and is located on the Vistula river, in historic Lesser Poland. It used to be a town from 1347 to 1869. Even though technically a village, Solec maintains the character of a town, with a traditional market square, a feature of other ancient European towns.
In its early days, Solec used to be called "Solca", and the name most probably comes from trading of salt, which took place here. The village was also called "Solec Sandomierski" and "Solec Radomski", and in the 19th century, the name Solec nad Wisłą was accepted, to distinguish it from other places, such as Solec Kujawski.
Solec has a long history, it was first mentioned in 1138 in the Gniezno bull, and at that time, it belonged to the Archbishop of Gniezno. In the 12th century the village belonged to the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, and in 1325 it was purchased by King Władysław Łokietek. In 1347 King Kazimierz Wielki granted it Magdeburg rights, building here a castle and renovating a parish church.
In the 15th and 16th centuries Solec emerged as a local salt trade center. It organized fairs and enjoyed several privileges, confirmed by King Zygmunt Stary. In 1615-1627 Krzysztof Zbaraski rebuilt the castle in Renaissance style and founded a monastery. During the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660) the prosperous town and the castle were completely destroyed - out of 246 houses, only 6 remained after the war. The town, which until the Partitions of Poland belonged to Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship, began to slowly recover in the 18th century. After the dissolution of Poland it was annexed first by Austria, and in 1815, by Russian-controlled Congress Poland. After the January Uprising Solec lost its town charter (1869), and has been a village since then.

Netherlands Symphony Orchestra

The Netherlands Symphony Orchestra (Dutch: "Nederlands Symfonieorkest") is a Dutch symphony orchestra. The home of the orchestra is the Muziekcentrum in Enschede. The orchestra was previously known in Dutch as Orkest van het Oosten (literal translation "Orchestra of the East"), but in October 2011 changed its Dutch name to align with the English name. At the same time the Dutch abbreviation "OvhO" was replaced with "NedSym."
Netherlands Symphony Orchestra performs about 75 concerts a year in Enschede, Hengelo, Zwolle and Deventer, as well as throughout the province of Overijssel and the Randstad. NedSym also serves as orchestra with the Nationale Reisopera for two productions a year and various provincial choirs. 
History.
The precursor ensemble to the Orkest van het Oosten was the "Twents Kamerorkest" (Twents Chamber Orchestra), an amateur ensemble which began performing in the 1930s under the direction of Klaas de Rook. In 1947, this orchestra changed its name to the "Twents Philharmonisch Orkest" (Twents Philharmonic Orchestra). In 1954, the orchestra became fully professional under the name of the "Overijssels Philharmonisch Orkest" (Overijssels Philharmonic Orchestra), incorporating musicians from the Twents Harpsichord Ensemble and the Twents Chamber Orchestra. 
In 1983, the Overijssels Philharmonic Orchestra was merged with Opera Forum. The two orchestras were joined together as the Forum Philharmonic operating in two formations: one for accompanying the opera the other for symphonic concerts, and a few times a year both together for large scale productions. In 1994, the orchestra was seriously reduced and formed an independent ensemble under the name Orkest van het Oosten. At the same time, in 1994, the Nationale Reisopera was organised from Opera Forum, without an orchestra. The Orkest van het Oosten contracted to accompany two Nationale Reisopera productions a year.
Conductors.
Jaap van Zweden was chief conductor of the OvhO from 1996 to 2005. Since the 2006-2007 season, Jan Willem de Vriend has been chief conductor of the OvhO, with an initial contract of 3 years. Although there have been reports of controversy over his direction of the OvhO, his contract with the OvhO has been extended to 2012. In 2010 the "Orkest van het Oosten" was awarded with an Edison award.
In 2009 Ed Spanjaard conducted Das Rheingold, of Wagner’s Ring des Nibelungen with the Nationale Reisopera and Orkest van het Oosten in Enschedé where in 2010 he will be conducting Die Walküre.

Newfoundland Margarine Company Limited

The Newfoundland Butter Company founded by Sir John Chalker Crosbie in 1925 was one of three oleomargarine manufacturing firms established in Newfoundland during the early 20th century. Oleomargarine or margarine manufacturing plants which used beef fat and lard as main ingredients were established as an inexpensive alternative to butter manufacture which traditional used dairy products. With the expertise of George Ehlers, a Danish chemist, the Crosbie family had grown the firm into the largest margarine manufacturing firm in Newfoundland. The Newfoundland Butter Company through acquisition and merger over the years with the other two manufacturing plants was eventually sold to Lever Brothers of England in 1938 and became a subsidiary of Lever Brothers of Canada. To reflect the product of manufacture the company name was changed in 1950 to The Newfoundland Margarine Company Limited.
History.
Oleomargarine was invented by a French chemist in 1869, which uses a variety of soluble and insoluble ingredients which quickly became an alternative to butter. Soon after its invention it came under regulation, to protect the dairy industry where taxes were levied on yellow margarine and in some countries an outright ban on its sale. 
Newfoundland did not have a strong dairy industry at the turn of the 19th century and subsequently embraced the production of margarine. Then in 1883, under the direction of Robert A. Brehm, Harvey and Company started the first margarine manufacturing plant. This plant used fish and seal oils in its production. Brehm had left Harvey and Company shortly thereafter and started a second manufacturing plant under the name Hearn and Company which he eventually renamed Brehm Manufacturing Company after the death of his partners. 
A third manufacturing plant was opened on LeMarchant Road, St. John’s by John Chalker Crosbie in 1925. They had hired the expertise of a Danish chemist George Ehlers in its manufacture. Within a short time this firm had taken a leading role in the production of margarine for the country. The product was sold in wooden tubs under the brands of "Golden Spread" and "Silver Spread".
The original two companies, Harvey and Company and Brehm Manufacturing Company had amalgamated in 1932 and sold their plant to Lever Brothers of England under Unilever Limited in 1937. Then in 1938 the Newfoundland Butter Company was sold to the Lever Brothers. Then only one plant remained in existence, The Newfoundland Butter Company on LeMarchant Road. The name was eventually changed to Newfoundland Margarine Company Limited in 1950.
Margarine and Confederation.
Margarine manufacture in Canada was banned in 1886 and remained so until 1948 except for the period from 1917 to 1923 when the ban was lifted because of shortages of butter during the war. However, Newfoundland continued to manufacture margarine (the first plant had opened in 1883) and at times sold margarine to the rest of Canada at half the price of butter. Before Newfoundland joined in confederation with the rest of Canada such had become a negotiation point which in turn led to Term 46 of the Newfoundland Act. A stipulation within Term 46 prohibited the sale of margarine to the rest of Canada but allowed the manufacture and sale of margarine within Newfoundland as noted herein:
After the joining of the Dominion of Newfoundland into confederation with Canada the Newfoundland Butter Company became the first margarine manufacturing plant in Canada. Due to Term 46 regarding the sale of margarine it became unlawful to ship to any other province within Canada. This turn of events did not please everyone and it drew well known Newfoundland political satirist and poet Greg Power (1909 - 1997) to write the poem "The Ballad of Oleo Margarine".
The Ballad of Oleo Margarine<br>
I pray that I shall never know <br>
A future without oleo,<br>
Or live to see my little sons<br>
Turn up their noses at my buns;<br>
But there is one with soul so dead,<br>
Who’d sacrifice our spread for bread,<br>
And ban from every Newfie table<br>
Our wholesome, rich, improved Green Label.<br>
- excerpt from "The Ballad of Oleo Margarine", Greg Power (1909 - 1997)
Closure and current status.
Major brands produced by the Newfoundland Margarine Company were "Good Luck" and "Eversweet". Both of these products become staples of many households within the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. In early 2000 Unilever made the announcement that it will be closing the manufacturing plant in St. John's. The plant on LeMarchant Road closed in 2004 and the building was demolished in 2007 to make way for a Shoppers Drug Mart.

Tai Lin Radio Service

Tai Lin Radio Service Limited was one of Hong Kong's largest electrical appliance retail chains. Founded in 1946, it liquidated on 17 October 2008, having thirteen branches altogether throughout the territory at the time.
History.
Tai Lin opened its first store at 309 Nathan Road, Yau Ma Tei, primarily selling radio sets. Since then, it rapidly developed its servicing, management and retail services, besides including tape recorders, gramophones and amplifiers into its line-up. In 1957, Tai Lin became the first electrical appliance store to introduce stereo Hi-Fi to the Hong Kong market.
In the population boom of the 1960s, Tai Lin expanded its product line to television sets, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners and cameras, among others, and at the same time, opening new branches to form a retail chain. In 1976, Tai Lin registered itself as a company under the name "Tai Lin Radio Services Limited."
The 1980s and 1990s were defined as Tai Lin's "golden age." The chain has spent HK$50 million in 1989 to refurbish its existing branches. In addition to three stores in Mong Kok and To Kwa Wan, Tai Lin made its proactive expansion throughout the Hong Kong market with new stores in Kwun Tong, Sha Tin, Causeway Bay "et cetera". At its peak in 1997, Tai Lin had 13 stores altogether.
After 62 years in existence, Tai Lin collapsed and succumbed, reportedly to the effects of the global financial crisis, affecting 260 personnel from thirteen branches.

Morituri (1948 film)

Morituri is a 1948 German black and white drama film produced by Artur Brauner's CCC Film. The film was directed by Eugen York and starred Walter Richter, Winnie Markus and . It features the onscreen debut of German actor Klaus Kinski as a Dutch concentration camp prisoner.
Plot.
As the end of the Second World War approaches and the Soviet Red Army is advancing, a group of concentration camp inmates is helped to escape by a Polish doctor. They hide in a wood where they meet other fugitives, who have been there for months, constantly in fear of being discovered. Out of fear of the German army patrols, they do not dare to leave the forest, even as the food supplies run low. The Polish doctor blows up a bridge, attracting the German troops' attention to the forest. The soldiers come perilously close to the hidden fugitives, but in the last moment have to retreat before the approaching Red Army units.
Production.
The title comes from the Latin expression "Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant". 
Making this film was a very personal project for Artur Brauner. The script is based on an idea of his and this was only the second film made by his company CCC Film.
Exteriors were shot near Berlin in Brandenburg, interiors in Berlin-Tempelhof. Principal cinematography was from September 1947 to January 1948. 
Reception.
The film was first shown on 28 August 1948 at the Venice Film Festival on the Lido di Venezia, Italy. 
It premiered in the "Waterloo-Theater", Hamburg, Germany on 24 September 1948. It was released at the "Neues Scala Kino" in Berlin on 16 November 1948. The film was a commercial disaster, with audiences hissing and booing. A theater in Hamburg was vandalized, after which other theater owners, fearful of reprisal by Nazi sympathizers, refused to show the film. It was called "Freiwild" in Austria. 
"Morituri" was aired on German television station ZDF on 7 April 1991. 
In 2009 Artur Brauner donated the film to Yad Vashem along with 20 other Holocaust-related films he had produced.

Brunswick Beacon

With a circulation of about 15,000, the Brunswick Beacon serves Shallotte, the islands of Holden Beach, Sunset Beach and Ocean Isle Beach, as well as a number of other coastal communities in southern Brunswick County including Carolina Shores, Calabash and other rural small towns. Because of the area's allure to tourists and retirees insistent on keeping up with Brunswick County's burgeoning real estate market, the Beacon boasts paid circulation in 49 states.
The Brunswick Beacon was founded by Brunswick County native Robert B. Stanley, Sr. in 1962, following a series of ill-fated publications that served the area dating back to the 1930s. The first publication of what would become The Brunswick Beacon was called Shallotte Press and was dated November 1, 1962. A contest held to name the paper was won by Shallotte businesswoman, JoAnn Simmons.
With the islands nearly vacant in the early 1960s and small pockets of population in the fishing-dominated surrounding communities, front page news from that period included a local man being stung by a bee, a raid on a local still, and a jailbreak in a neighboring town.
The Beacon was purchased in 1970 by Edward Sweatt, then a partner in Community Newspapers Inc. out of Spartanburg, S.C. Sweatt and his wife, Carolyn, staved off competition from several groups intent on starting a second newspaper in the market and skillfully guided the Beacon through the area's population explosion in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By the mid-1990s, real estate and service industry advertising allowed the Beacon to expand from printing 28 to 32 pages to 70-plus pages each week.
In early 2001, the Beacon moved from its location on Main Street to a new 21,000 square foot office center and printing plant on Smith Avenue. The Beacon was purchased in June 2003 by Landmark Community Newspapers Inc. out of Shelbyville, Ky. LCNI is a division of Landmark Media Enterprises, a privately held media company in Norfolk, Va. with interests in newspapers and special publications, TV broadcasting, cable programming, outdoor advertising, and education.

Marchigiano dialect

Marchigiano is an Italian dialect spoken in the region of Marche, in Italy, in a zone which includes the provinces of Ancona, the Macerata's one and the Fermo's one. It is one of the Central Italian dialects, and considered connected to Umbrian dialects and Tuscan much more in the northern part. There are notable grammatical and idiomatic differences between Marchigiano and standard Italian language.
In itself Marchigiano is not uniform from town to town, being divided in three main parts:
Common features.
The three areas of the Marchigiano dialect are united by some common features which distinguish the dialect from the others central Italian languages :
The conjugation of "to be" and "to have got" at the present indicative tense in the two main dialects is as follows :
Features of the three areas.
Ancona's dialect.
The dialect of Ancona is spoken in the region of the town of Ancona, Porto Recanati, Loreto, Osimo, Jesi, Chiaravalle and Falconara. Particularly this dialect's speakers always use the articles "el" ("the" male singular, Italian "il") unlike standard Italian which in some cases uses "lo" ("the" male singular). Only the speakers of the towns which are closer to Macerata (Osimo, Castelfidardo, Loreto, Porto Recanati) use the article "lo" as in Italian. These cities also undergo other influences from Macerata's dialect because they are closer to it.
Fabriano's dialect.
The dialect of Fabriano is spoken in the town of Fabriano (closer to Umbria) and in the towns closer to it. Rhotacism occurs in this dialect ("calza" (sock) > carza, "fulmine" (lightning) > furmine).
Macerata's dialect.
The dialect of Macerata is spoken in the province of Macerata and in the Fermo's one. The speakers of Macerata,to say "the", use "lu "(male singular) and "lo" (neuter singular) .
Rhotacism occurs. A lot of assimilations occur:

The Dragons (band)

The Dragons were a rock band based in San Diego, California, that released seven albums between 1991 and 2005. The band was notably fronted by singer/guitarist Mario Escovedo, whose musical family also includes Alejandro Escovedo, Pete Escovedo, Javier Escovedo (The Zeros), Coke Escovedo, Paris Escovedo (the son of Coke Escovedo) and Sheila E. Other members of The Dragons included Ken Horne (lead guitar), Steve Rodriguez (bass guitar) and Jarrod Lucas (drums).
The band played a combination of glam, garage and punk rock, similar to New York Dolls and Hanoi Rocks.
Before starting The Dragons, both Escovedo and Rodriguez had played together in a local San Diego band called M-80. The Dragons formed in 1991 and later that year performed at the first of their 11 appearances at South by Southwest. The band released an eponymous vinyl album in 1992 for the Spanish label Imposible Records. 
A year later they followed with a single for Poptone Records that brought them a lot of local radio exposure. In 1996, The Dragons recorded "Painkiller" for Scam-O-Rama records. Two years later in The Dragons signed a deal with Junk Records and released "Cheers to Me", "R.L.F." and "Kamikaze" in three consecutive years. The band followed that with a Japanese-only release "The Dragons." In 2003, The Dragons signed with Gearhead Records and released "Sin Salvation." Over the years, the band toured nationally both on the club circuit and as opening act for major bands.
After 13 years and seven albums, the band announced it was parting ways in November 2005. Guitarist Horne moved back to his native Japan, and in 2008 joined The Bronx. The Dragons have since reformed with guest lead guitarists for a few one-off shows from time to time.
Escovedo has since formed a new band called the Mario Escovedo Xperience (MEX for short) that plays music more akin to Los Lobos and the Texas Tornados than the hard rock of The Dragons.

Weighted-knuckle glove

Weighted-knuckle gloves, also called sap gloves, are a type of weapon used in hand to hand combat. They consist of a pair of ordinary looking gloves usually made of leather or a synthetic material, with powdered lead or steel sewn into a special pouch covering the knuckles, and often the backs of the fingers and the back of the hand. In some designs, this distinctive feature is obvious, while in others it is almost completely indistinguishable from an ordinary glove, allowing the gloves to be worn in plain sight without suspicion.
They are primarily used by security guards, and by bouncers and other security professionals where physical combat is expected.
Usage.
The purpose of these gloves in combat is both offensive and defensive. Offensively, the weight of the metal powder adds mass and therefore kinetic energy to punches, back-hands and other hand strikes. The weighting also distributes the impact in a manner similar to a blackjack, transferring concussive force in the case of a head-strike to cause a knockout. This is the opposite of brass knuckles, which are designed to concentrate the force of a blow in a smaller area to cause more tissue damage.
However, the primary aim of the gloves is actually defensive. Normally, punches with the unprotected hand against an opponent’s head or face will painfully injure the hand in the process, and strikes to the mouth can often result in severe lacerations from the opponent’s teeth. The layer of powdered metal serves to protect the hand against these injuries, without compromising the effectiveness of the strike. Properly executed, a person wearing weighted knuckle gloves can even punch glass or concrete without injury or even pain.
The gloves also protect the hand from blows inflicted by the opponent, allowing the user to block minor strikes from blunt weapons such as sticks. This is especially important in maintaining one’s grip on the opponent should they try to dislodge the grip using strikes to the back of the hand. Some designs include a Kevlar lining to add further protection against lacerations.
Legality.
Unlike brass knuckles, weighted knuckle gloves are legal in most areas, as they are generally considered “less-lethal weapons", due to their defensive nature. In some jurisdictions, including Australia, they may be restricted under more general "dangerous weapons" laws.
In the United States, weighted knuckle gloves are illegal in the states of Massachusetts and California. In New York, sap gloves are "not" specifically denominated as unlawful weapons by state law. However, they may be unlawful to possess with intent to use them unlawfully against another.
In the United Kingdom, weighted knuckle gloves are legal to buy, sell and own. However possession in a public place without a reasonable excuse or lawful authority is illegal.

Vasilissa ergo gaude

Vasilissa ergo gaude (""Therefore rejoice, princess"") is an isorhythmic motet by the Renaissance composer Guillaume Dufay. In terms of its subject matter, it is sometimes grouped together with Lamentatio sanctae matris ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae, Apostolus gloriosus and Balsamus et munda cera which are generically called Dufay's "Byzantine motets". Its composition was occasioned by the marriage on the 21st of January 1421 of Cleofa Malatesta, daughter of Malatesta di Pandolfo, to Theodore II Palaiologos son of the Byzantine emperor Manuel II and Despot of the Morea. It has been surmised that the actual motet was composed in 1420 and is perhaps the earliest example of this choral form if not the earliest work attributed to Dufay. In earlier scholarship it was assumed that the motet's first performance had taken place on May 19, 1419 during the festivities prior to the marriage 
The tenor line is taken from Psalm 45:11 (44:11 in the traditional Catholic numbering), whose theme is royal marriage. The verse chosen for the motet occurs in Catholic liturgy in the Gradual of various feasts of the Virgin Mary. The motet is preserved in the contemporary music manuscript Codex Bologna, International museum and library of music, MS Q15.
In terms of structure the composition has been compared with the mature work of Johannes Ciconia, a Franco-Flemish composer also active in Italy. Of the four voices used, the two upper voices bearing the melody often imitate each other and move faster than the two lower voices. The talea is repeated only once. An additional device independent from the motet's purely isorythmic design is the canonic introit (a short canon used as a prelude) appearing at the beginning of the composition. 
Even though numerological mysticism which is often encountered in the Ars Antiqua seems to have been of minor importance in musical composition from the 14th century onwards, there have been attempts to interpret the motet's texture and design from a symbolic-mystical viewpoint. Dufay is known to have utilised similar devices such as gematria (a system of number symbolism drawn from the Pythagorean corpus) in other nuptial compositions. The tenor line singing the Cantus firmus in "Vasilissa ergo gaude" consists of a total of 2x49 notes plus the two closing notes which add to a total of 100 notes. It has been suggested that this number implies the medieval symbolism for repentance which leads to absolute unity. It has further been proposed that the number 100 should be related to the total of 700 or else 7x100 notes of the remaining three voices, alluding thus to the sacred number 7. The sum total of notes in the motet is 800 and this has been interpreted as an allusion to the number 8. In medieval numerology, 8 signified eternity, understood in the context of Dufay's motet as eternal stability. 
All these numerical symbolisms must have had a particular significance in view of the politically motivated marriage between Cleofa Malatesta and Theodoros Palaiologos. The marriage was arranged as part of a series of diplomatic gestures between Cleofa's uncle Pope Martin V and the Byzantine emperor. It was hoped that it would facilitate reunification between the Roman Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Spunky and Tadpole

Spunky and Tadpole was an animated television series produced by Beverly Hills Productions and syndicated beginning on September 6, 1958. The show's characters were a boy and a bear who hunted down bad guys in a string of made for TV installments, usually running ten installments shown in two weeks or two for one week. The show remained in production until 1961.
According to "Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 Through 2003:"
"Ultra-chintzy both in concept and execution... Spunky and Tadpole was given a big-bucks promotional sendoff in 1958 by its first syndicator, Guild Films. A major TV distributor of the period thanks to such valuable properties as the Liberace Show and the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes theatrical cartoons, Guild secured bookings for Spunky and Tadpole in several top markets, promising a series that would appeal equally to grownups and children. Competition from stronger syndies like Huckleberry Hound and the Three Stooges shorts caused Spunky & Tadpole to fall by the wayside, and when Guild disappeared in a merger at the end of the 1950s, the cartoons were shunted around to several minor distributors. Offered at bargain rates to less affluent stations in smaller markets, Spunky & Tadpole continued to play unobtrusively into the mid-1960s."

Oluf Rygh

Oluf Rygh (5 September 1833 – 19 August 1899) was a noted Norwegian archaeologist, philologist and historian. Oluf Rygh is recognized as one of the founders of professional archaeology in Norway.
Background.
Oluf Rygh was born in Verdal. His parents were Peder Strand Rygh (1800–1868) and Ingeborg Marie Bentsen (1809–1878). He was the older brother of Evald Rygh and Karl Ditlev Rygh. Oluf Rygh attended the Trondhjem Cathedral School in 1850 and went to the University of Christiania to study philology, where he graduated in 1856. In 1858, while a teacher at Nissens Skole in Christiania, he was a research fellow for history. Later he was a professor of classical philology, history and Scandinavian languages.
Career.
Rygh was professor of history at the Royal Frederick University between 1866 and 1875. He was director of "Oldsaksamlingen" (which subsequently became the Museum of Cultural History) from 1862 and professor of Nordic archeaology from 1875 – the first professor of archaeology at any Scandinavian university. He led excavation of the Tune ship 1867. His work "Norske Oldsaker" (Norwegian Antiquities) published in 1885 is recognized for its detailed illustrations and even today is still a significant reference source.
From 1879 to 1899 he chaired the Norwegian Historical Association.
Oluf Rygh is best known for creation of "Norske Gaardnavne" (Norwegian Farm Names), which is a 19 volume set of books based on a manuscript prepared from 1897 to 1924. The book contains a standardized notation, information on pronunciation, historical forms and the etymology for recorded farm, estate and manor names in Norway, which became the standard for place names in Norway. It inspired similar research in Sweden and Denmark. Rygh died in 1899 at Ulefoss in Holla, Telemark. At the time of his death, only three and one half volumes had been published.
Legacy.
The street "Oluf Ryghs gate" at Fagerborg has been named after him.

Newport Roman Villa

Newport Roman Villa was a Romano-British farmhouse built in 280 AD. It is located near to Newport, Isle of Wight. 
Discovery and excavation.
Newport Roman Villa was first discovered in 1926 when the owner of a nearby house laid foundations for a garage. The site was excavated and the ground plan of the villa house was uncovered. 
Thanks to public interest and the generosity of the developer, the site was preserved and protected by a cover building. It is now a scheduled ancient monument, giving it protected status. 
History.
Newport Roman Villa was built around 280 AD with local stone including flint, chalk, limestone and greensand with the walls remaining almost at their original height. The building was roofed with massive slabs of Bembridge limestone which needed large roof timbers to support them. Many of these roof slabs had a distinctive shape, pierced with a single hole to take a nail, were found on the site. It is likely the building was the centre of a wealthy estate.
The discovery of fragments of window glass on the site shows that the building had some glazed windows, and remains of painted wall plaster during excavation show that at least some of the rooms had brightly coloured interior walls.
It features one of the best preserved Roman bath suites with hypocaust underfloor heating. The furnace for heating the bath suite was outside the back wall of the villa at the end of the bath wing, and a servant would have been responsible for providing it with fuel. The hot air from the furnace passed through an arch at the base of the villa's back wall and circulated under the raised floors of the three rooms.
It remains unknown when life at the villa ended. During excavation, the skull of a woman in her early thirties was found in the corner of one of the rooms. It has been suggested that she was killed during a raid in an abandoned building. However it is also viewed that the abandonment of the island's villas by the middle of the fourth century could be due to economic hardship rather than the threat of attacks by Anglo-saxon raiders.
Museum.
The villa has since been reconstructed based on the latest archaeological evidence featuring a Roman kitchen and Roman garden. It is now open to the public usually from around April to October. The villa regularly has over 5,000 visitors per year, with a further 1,400 school children taking part in educational visits. It is located on Cypress Road in Newport on the Isle of Wight in the middle of a residential development.
For 2009 the villa underwent a roof replacement project, involving essential repairs and replacement of the cover-building roof structure to protect it from further weathering. The project has been joint-funded by the Isle of Wight Council and English Heritage, which grant-aided over £40,000 towards costs. The roof has been designed to improve environmental conditions, reducing moisture levels which have contributed to a build-up of algae on the mosaics below.

You Belong to Me (Carly Simon song)

"You Belong to Me" is a song written by American singer-songwriters Carly Simon and Michael McDonald. Originally recorded by McDonald's rock group The Doobie Brothers for their seventh studio album, "Livin' on the Fault Line" (1977), the song was made famous by Simon herself when recorded for her seventh studio album, "Boys in the Trees" (1978). Released as the album's lead single, her version reached the top ten of the Pop Singles chart in late June 1978. A live version of the song from The Doobie Brothers' 1983 album "Farewell Tour" would later chart on the Pop Singles chart at number seventy-nine in early August 1983.
Artists who have covered "You Belong to Me" include Anita Baker on the 1990 compilation album "", and her 1994 album, "Rhythm of Love", Jennifer Lopez on her 2002 album "This Is Me... Then", and Chaka Khan on her 2007 album "Funk This"—the latter being a collaboration with Michael McDonald. It was also recorded in Finnish by Finnish singer Maarit for her 1978 album "Siivet saan", retitled "Yhteen kuulutaan". Los Hooligans, a traditional ska band from Fresno, CA, covered the song on their "Mafioso Ska" CD released in 2006 with lead vocals sung by Randy Young.
Simon's version was featured on the soundtrack to the romantic comedy films "Desperately Seeking Susan" (1985) and "Little Black Book" (2004).

The Shawnee Inn &amp; Golf Resort

The Shawnee Inn & Golf Resort is a resort located in the village of Shawnee on Delaware in Smithfield Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania, east of Stroudsburg. 
The Buckwood Inn, an exclusive resort with an 18-hole golf course, was built by Charles Campbell Worthington, formerly head of the Worthington Pump and Machinery Corporation. This later became the Shawnee Country Club. The course was completed around 1910. In 1912 Worthington invited professional golfers to compete on his course, and this led to the foundation of the PGA of America. After trying unsuccessfully to keep the fairways in shape by grazing sheep on them, Worthington designed the gang mower with three moving wheels. He launched the Shawnee Mower Factory to manufacture it.
The golf course hosted the PGA Championship in 1938, which Paul Runyan won beating then Shawnee "touring pro" Sam Snead. In 1967, Hale Irwin won the NCAA Championship on the course for the University of Colorado. The course is located on an island in the middle of the Delaware River, across from Hardwick Township, New Jersey. The course was designed by renowned architect A.W. Tillinghast who also designed Winged Foot Golf Club, Baltusrol, Newport Country Club, Ridgewood Country Club, and Bethpage Black.

Croatian Fraternal Union Avenue

Croatian Fraternal Union Avenue (, often shortened to "Avenija HBZ") is a controlled-access avenue in Zagreb, Croatia. Going north-south, the avenue connects the Martinovka neighborhood near downtown and Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall in the north with Novi Zagreb and the Freedom Bridge in the south. 
The road runs from Paromlinska Street to Tomljanovićeva Road, intersecting Vukovar Avenue, Slavonska Avenue (interchange) and ending in the south with an interchange on Tomljanovićeva Road. Although it carries a lot of traffic, its drivers have to stop at traffic lights built on each intersection and interchange, prompting its status as one of the deadliest roads in Zagreb.
The avenue carries six lanes of traffic throughout its length except for the Freedom Bridge. An expansion of the bridge is planned for 2009.

The Idolmaster SP

One reason for dividing "SP" among three versions when developing the games was to allow players to buy the version which features their favorite idols. Rival idols were introduced into "SP" because the development team felt that rivals are essential for "The Idolmaster", which also serve to deepen the bonds between the player and an idol. Including downloadable content, the game features 54 songs the idols perform: 34 songs in original versions and 20 remixes of those songs, which have been released on several music albums. The three versions of "SP" sold 129,088 units collectively in their first week of sales, and together ranked as the second best-selling video games in Japan that week.
Gameplay.
"The Idolmaster SP" is a series of three raising simulation games in which the player assumes the role of a producer working for the talent agency 765 Production (765 Pro) who is in charge of training 10 prospective pop idols on their way to stardom. The idols who the player is able to produce are dependent on the version of the game. In "Perfect Sun", the idols are Haruka Amami, Yayoi Takatsuki, and Makoto Kikuchi; in "Missing Moon", the idols are Chihaya Kisaragi, Azusa Miura, and Ritsuko Akizuki; lastly, in "Wandering Star", the idols are Iori Minase, Yukiho Hagiwara, and Ami and Mami Futami (who work as a pair). Each version also features an exclusive idol from the rival agency 961 Production who make up the idol unit Project Fairy: Hibiki Ganaha in "Perfect Sun", Miki Hoshii in "Missing Moon", and Takane Shijō in "Wandering Star".
The games have two main modes of gameplay—a free produce mode and a story produce mode—in which the player can choose only one of the 765 Pro idols to produce at a time. In the free produce mode, the player produces a given idol for a period of 52 weeks, culminating in a farewell concert. It is divided into easy, normal and hard modes which correspond to the degree of difficulty it is to satisfy various goals during gameplay. In the story produce mode, the main goal is for the player's chosen idol to win the Idol Ultimate (IU) competition and compete against the rival idols. Unlike the free produce mode, the story produce mode contains an additional aspect called the rank up limit where the player's idol must gain a certain number of fans by a specified time so as to pass qualifying rounds for IU. If the player is not able to gain enough fans or fails an IU audition, the player is given the option to retry; if a player does not choose to retry, that current producing session will end. The games also contain an additional multiplayer mode called the agency mode in which up to three players can play together. Each of the players' idols can communication with each other, compete against each other in auditions, and exchange accessories, among other things.
At the start of every in-game day, the player checks the idol's mail, which may include mail from industry professionals and fan letters. This is followed by greeting the idol, and during this time, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will affect an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by the color of a heart on the heads-up display. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue, to yellow and finally red as enthusiasm increases. The player can view the state of an idol's statistics at this time, which are divided into three categories: vocal, dance and visual image. As these increase, an idol's overall image level will also increase, but the level may also decrease during gameplay. The player is shown an idol report which shows an idol's rank and level, and contains current popularity trends in vocal, dance and visual image, which gives the player a guide on how to gain popularity.
The player must organize an idol's daily schedule including what she will do in the morning, afternoon and evening. There is a large amount of freedom in organizing the schedule, though each event may take up either one-third, two-thirds or an entire day of in-game time to complete. The schedule choices include: changing an idol's costume or song, making appointments with reporters or stylists, taking a lesson, doing promotional work, taking an audition, or taking the day off. The lessons are in the form of six minigames which serve to increase an idol's statistics in either vocal, dance or visual image. Each lesson is timed, which varies between lessons, and the lesson's overall performance is ranked from bad, to normal, good and finally perfect. The player may also choose to do a hard lesson, which is more demanding and takes more in-game time. The promotional phase of the gameplay mainly deals with the player talking with the idol and doing jobs to further her publicity. Like when greeting the idol before, the player is given multiple responses to choose from over the course of a conversation. Depending on which choice is made will affect how well or poorly the communication is received from bad, to normal, good and finally perfect communication, which results in either good or bad memories. The good memories are tallied in the heart on the heads-up display.
When the player chooses to do an audition, they first select the song and costume the idol will use if she passes the audition; the song is also used during the audition. Each costume and song have either a vocal, dance or visual attribute which will affect the results of the audition. Before an idol can take an audition, she must satisfy specific criteria for a given audition, such as having a certain number of fans or having already passed a number of previous auditions. Once an audition is chosen, the player can view the rank and level of the other idols who are auditioning. When taking an audition, the player guides the idol to appeal to three judges in vocal, dance and visual image by receiving points in each category. How many points an idol receives when appealing is dependent on her statistics. Each audition is divided into three segments of nine attempts at an appeal followed by a mid-audition review. At the end of each segment, the three idols with the most points in a given image category will receive a number of stars in that category dependent on the current popularity trends from the idol report; an idol will also lose a star if she has the least points in a given category.
The interest level of the judges is indicated by three gauges which increase and decrease depending on how well or poorly an appeal is received. The appeals are also affected by how well the player stays in rhythm with the chosen song. If one judge is appealed to too many times, their interest level may drop to zero, at which point all the stars earned for that category will be revoked. The player also has the option to use up to three good memories during each audition which serve to dramatically increase an idol's appeal points and the gauges for the judges. At the end of the audition, the number of stars received determines if the idol passes or not. If an idol passes the audition, she is chosen to do a televised performance of the song previously chosen. A performance serves to increase an idol's number of fans, which in turn can increase an idol's rank if enough fans have been obtained for a given rank. An idol's rank starts at F, and goes up in stages to E, D, C, B, A and finally S. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. Once the day's schedule has been completed, the player returns to 765 Pro will the idol. The player will be shown the idol's rank, how many fans she has gained over the course of the day, and how many fans she currently has. If available, the idol will be given various presents from her fans at this time.
An additional feature to the gameplay is the promise system, which has to do with the player making various promises with an idol. If the promise is kept, the player will receive some sort of bonus, but if the promise is broken, there is a large penalty. The player is given the option to make a promise or not, and can usually refuse to do so. These promises take various forms, such as arranging to take auditions with rival idols, arranging to meet with reporters or stylists, and specific demands an idol will make in regard to her schedule. For lessons and auditions, the player is also given the option for the idol to promise to do a self-lesson or self-audition in which she does them by herself. For a self-lesson or self-audition, the player inputs a time and date, and the PlayStation Portable (PSP) will be put into sleep mode. The closer the player is to taking the PSP out of sleep mode by the specified time, the better the results of the lesson or audition. A similar feature is sometimes employed when the player chooses to end the game. An idol will stop the player and designate a time and date by which the player must continue playing the game; the player does not have the option to refuse.
Development and release.
"The Idolmaster SP" was developed by Namco Bandai Games and directed by Akihiro Ishihara. When developing the ports, the staff wanted to reach out to players outside of those who had already played the original arcade game or its Xbox 360 port. Ishihara himself not only wanted there to be a line to buy the games in Akihabara, but also wanted there to be those who would see the games being sold in a shop and spontaneously buy them. For this reason, it was decided that limited editions of "SP" would not be sold. Ishihara felt the need to get closer to the end users in part because of the players who had helped spread the word about "The Idolmaster", so "SP" was divided into three versions to allow players to buy the version which features their favorite idols.
In addressing the PlayStation Portable's graphic capabilities compared to previous games in the series being developed for the Xbox 360, Ishihara points out that despite what people may think, once the idols start moving, they actually look much better than when viewed as a still image. Ishihara also notes that many of the idols' facial expressions in "SP" were changed from previous games. He goes on to say that for a game intended for a portable game console, there was a considerable amount of tinkering, and that the development team had to completely rebuild the game.
Ishihara likens the story produce mode first introduced in "SP" to a strategic simulation game where a large development in the story will occur after one part of the story is cleared. The development team included a large amount of story within each idol rank, as well as smaller scenarios between the ranks, resulting in a substantial amount of detail. The team had wanted to include a mode that would be similar to the original arcade game's gameplay, but Ishihara thought that simply adding in the functionality of the arcade game would not work. So while the story produce mode in "SP" can be thought as similar to how the arcade game operated, Ishihara points out that there is an added sense of tension surrounding an increase in idol rank, which in turn causes the story in general to be tense. While Ishihara goes on to say the story produce mode was developed to be relatively severe, he notes that as long as players put in the effort, anyone can clear the game.
The introduction of rivals into "SP" had to do with Ishihara's view that rivals are essential for "The Idolmaster". In the arcade game version, players compete against other players online during the idol auditions, but because this feature was not going to be included in "SP", the staff thought to create rivals that the player would compete against in the story produce mode. Ishihara describes the main theme of "The Idolmaster" as having to do with the entertainment industry, and according to him, there needs to occasionally be elements that "shake up" the industry, such as rival characters. Namco Bandai Games producer Yōzō Sakagami notes that the development team focused on how to further deepen the bonds between the player and idols, and according to him, rivals are an essential part of that. Along with this, it was suggested that one of the idols leave 765 Production and go to rival studio 961 Production, and Miki Hoshii was chosen based on her "free and uncontrolled" personality.
The games were released in Japan on February 19, 2009. They were later released on Sony's PSP the Best collection on January 28, 2010, and became available for download through the PlayStation Store on October 28, 2010. Namco Bandai Games released 18 downloadable content (DLC) updates between February 19, 2009 and July 28, 2010 available through the PlayStation Store. An additional DLC update originally released with "The Idolmaster Break!" manga was re-released on the PlayStation Store on October 28, 2010. The updates include new songs and remixes, costumes, accessories, stages, and additional side-stories called "Idol Dramas".
Music.
"The Idolmaster SP" features 34 songs in original versions and 20 remixes of those songs, for a total of 54 songs written and composed by a variety of songwriters. Initially, the three versions each contain 20 songs, though 17 of them are common to each version. The remaining three songs in each version can only initially be sung by one idol. In "Perfect Sun", "I Want" is sung by Haruka Amami, is sung by Yayoi Takatsuki, and is sung by Makoto Kikuchi. In "Missing Moon", is sung by Ritsuko Akizuki, is sung by Chihaya Kisaragi, and is sung by Azusa Miura. In "Wandering Star", is sung by Iori Minase, "Kosmos, Cosmos" is sung by Yukiho Hagiwara, is sung by Ami and Mami Futami. Versions of these nine songs were later released in downloadable content packs so that all the idols could sing them, including Hibiki Ganaha, Miki Hoshii, and Takane Shijō. An additional eight songs in original versions were released in downloadable content packs, as were the 20 remixes.
Four songs were originally introduced in "SP": "Colorful Days", , and . The songs were released by Nippon Columbia on a 10-part CD series titled "The Idolmaster Master Special" between 2008 and 2010. The first two releases were the singles for "Colorful Days" and "Overmaster" on December 10, 2008. This was followed by eight compilation albums: "Master Special" volumes one through six from February 4 to August 5, 2009, "Master Special Winter" on December 16, 2009, and "Master Special Spring" on March 17, 2010.
Reception.
The three versions of "SP" sold 129,088 units collectively in their first week of sales, and together ranked as the second best-selling video games in Japan that week. The games sold an additional 26,931 units the following week, for a total of 156,019 units collectively. The games sold so well in Akihabara on their release day that several stores had sold out by late afternoon, in part because most who bought one version also bought the other two. "SP"s three versions received a combined score of 31 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine "Famitsu". The games were voted one of the most anticipated future game at the 2008 Japan Game Awards. In writing for "Famitsu", reviewer Sekai Sandai Miyokawa notes that in addition to the nature of the game having to do with training idols, "SP" being split into three versions may be off-putting for beginners to "The Idolmaster" series. However, he goes on to say that the game is not only friendly to beginners, but that each version have plenty of worthwhile content that gradually draws the player further into the series. The minigames played during the lessons are called "surprisingly difficult," especially if the player is aiming for a perfect score, and the continuous need to take more lessons has been likened to the plots of "Star of the Giants" and "Aim for the Ace!".
Despite a perceived drop in graphical quality compared to previous "Idolmaster" games developed for the Xbox 360, the idols' performances and bountiful facial expressions in "SP" are praised for their "high quality." The story presented in the story produce mode is described as "skillfully done with interesting developments." The game has been praised for the variety in musical genres of its songs, many of which are described as "leaving an impression" in one's ears. Miyokawa writes that the desire to hear all of the game's songs is one reason why someone would continue to play the game.

Simplified music notation

Simplified music notation is an alternative form of music notation designed to make sight-reading easier. It was proposed by Peter Hayes George (1927-2012). It is based on classical staff notation, but sharps and flats are incorporated into the shape of the noteheads. Notes such as double sharps and double flats are written at the pitch at which they are actually played, but preceded by symbols called "history signs" to show that they have been transposed. The key signature and all other information in the original score is retained, but the player does not need to remember the key signature and accidentals while playing.
The notation was designed to help players who struggle with sight-reading, including those who suffer from working memory impairments, dyslexia and other learning difficulties.
History.
Peter Hayes George (1927-2012) was born in Quebec, Canada, the son of a diplomat. He attended RADA and began his career as an actor playing roles such as the lead in ‘Malachi's Cove’ directed by Charles Frank and the juvenile lead in Peter Brook's London West End production "Dark of the Moon". In the 1960s he gave up acting as shortcomings with his working memory made it difficult for him to accept major roles with long speeches. 
After studying music for teachers at Los Angeles City College in 1962, George took up the piano. He thought that that since musicians can keep the music in front of them while playing, his memory problems would present no difficulty. However, he discovered that musicians must remember to modulate each musical note according to the key signature, to continue any accidentals through the bar, and to cancel them at the end of the bar. He also found difficulty in transposing notes such as double sharps and double flats.
His simplified music notation was designed in response to this. The original concept was formed in 1977 and the notation was developed over the next 30 years. The first series of music books in his simplified music notation was published in September 2008. A second series, "Key Perfect", was published in 2010. Its early-grade piano repertoire pieces were composed and compiled by music teacher and author John Kember and international pianist and lecturer John York. This latest series was designed to show the effectiveness of simplified music notation as a learning tool towards improving students' reading skills in traditional notation. 
Notation.
The basic concept of George's simplified music notation is that players should be able to play what they see, without having to adapt for key signature or complex accidentals.
The traditional sharp and flat symbols in the key signature are replaced by the sharp and flat noteheads of simplified music notation: a triangle for sharps and a rhombus for flats. The traditional oval notehead is used when a note is natural.
If there is a key change in the middle of a piece, the new key signature is shown without naturals to ‘neutralise’ the previous key. The exception to this is where the key changes to C major or A minor, where ‘neutralising’ naturals are used to make this clear. Instead of the traditional natural symbol, an oval notehead is used.
Double sharps, and double flats (and optionally B and E sharp, and F and C flat) are enharmonically transposed, and preceded by a symbol called a "history sign". History signs allow anybody studying the music to see how it was originally written and to analyse the harmonic progression of the piece. However, they can be ignored whilst sight-reading.

SG Egelsbach

The SG Egelsbach is a German association football club from the city of Egelsbach, Hesse.
History.
The club was formed after the Second World War in 1945 when four local sports associations merged, the "FC Egelsbach 1903, TV 1874 Egelsbach", "TG 1885 Egelsbach" and the "Arbeiter-Radfahrverein 1905". Through the "TV 1874", which was formed on 15 August 1874, the current club claims its foundation date within the club's name. Like in most other towns and cities within the US occupation zone, only one sports club was permitted to exist. The new "SGE" was heavily based on the pre-1933 workers clubs, which had been outlawed by the Nazis. But unlike most other places, where, after the liberlisation of occupation laws, the old sport associations re-surfaced, in Egelsbach the merger of the four formerly separate clubs endured.
For the most part of its history, the club existed as a minor local amateur side. The "SGE" first rose to attention when it earned promotion to the "Landesliga Hessen-Süd" (IV) in 1974. After a couple of good seasons in this league, a championship was won in 1979 and the "SGE" entered the "Oberliga Hessen" for the first time. Before that, in 1976, the club managed for the first time to qualify for the German Cup. In the DFB Cup 1976-77, it beat the 1. FC Mülheim 0–3 in the first round before falling to the VfL Osnabrück 0–2 in the next round.
The club only lasted for two seasons in this league before returning to the "Landesliga" in 1981. Another decent cup run in the DFB Cup 1980-81 saw the team again reach the second round. After defeating the TuS Neuendorf 3–4 in extra time, the 1. FC Kaiserslautern ended their run in round two. A runners-up spot in 1985 was the highlight of the following "Landesliga" seasons, before another league championship in 1989 earned it the return to the "Oberliga". Immediate relegation from this league was followed by another "Landesliga" championship and another return to the highest league in the state of Hesse.
The following three seasons saw the "SGE" do rather well, finishing fourth each year and subsequently earning entry to the new "Regionalliga Süd" in 1994.
In this league, the club was never more than a struggler and being able to survive for three seasons was certainly a success in itself. Eventually, however, relegation could not be avoided and in 1997 the team went back to the "Oberliga". The adventure "Regionalliga" however had cost the club dearly in financial terms and almost send it broke. A third appearance in the German Cup in 1994 did not change this all that much. Another loss to Kaiserslautern, this time in round one, was nevertheless quite honorable with a 0–2 result.
Back in the "Oberliga Hessen", the "SGE" finished a respectable seventh but a two-point deduction combined with the financial repercussions of semi-professional football forced the club in 1998 to downgrade its ambitions.
The club stepped down to the "Bezirksoberliga Darmstadt" (VI) for the 1998–99 season.
After a fall to as far as the "Kreisliga A-West Offenbach" (VIII), the club returned to the "Bezirksliga Frankfurt/Offenbach" (VII) in 2003. After the 2007–08 season, the Hesse FA overhauled its league system, renaming the "Bezirksliga" to "Kreisoberliga".
In 2008–09, the club had a bad start, sitting on last place in its league all season long, the "Kreisoberliga Gruppe Offenbach", and being relegated at the end. It took "SGE" until 2013 to win promotion back to the Kreisoberliga, after winning the championship in the Kreisliga.

Vanuatu and the United Nations

The Republic of Vanuatu has been a member of the United Nations since the year of its independence in 1980. The country was a particularly active member in the 1980s, when, governed by Prime Minister Father Walter Lini and represented by Ambassador Robert Van Lierop, it was a consistent advocate for decolonisation. Subsequently, its emphasis within the United Nations shifted to the issue of climate change and the vulnerability of Small Island Developing States.
1980s: the Lini and Van Lierop years.
In 1980, when the newly independent Vanuatu joined the United Nations, its Prime Minister, Walter Lini, asked Robert Van Lierop, an American film director and civil rights activist, to be its Permanent Representative at the United Nations. The two men had met when Vanuatu had been a topic of discussion at the U.N. just prior to its independence. Van Lierop accepted, and represented Vanuatu for over a decade. He was, throughout the 1980s, Vanuatu's only diplomat stationed permanently in New York, and he visited Vanuatu twice a year on average.
As Vanuatu's ambassador, and following instructions from the ni-Vanuatu government, he campaigned within the U.N. against apartheid in South Africa, and in favour of decolonisation for East Timor, Western Sahara, West Papua and New Caledonia, among others. Van Lierop stated in 1990 that "On the issue of decolonisation, in particular for New Caledonia, Vanuatu is recognised as one of the principal promoters of independence, and this has resulted in great respect for our country". Vanuatu was a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, and Lini's government cherished its independence, emphasising that Vanuatu had its own voice at the United Nations, eshewing alignment with either the Western bloc or the Eastern bloc.
In 1988, Van Lierop became Vice-President of 43rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 1990, he was chairman of the United Nations' Special Committee on Decolonization, in keeping with Vanuatu's long-standing efforts in that field.
Climate change and Small Island States' vulnerability.
In 1990, Van Lierop became the first chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States, a position which he held until 1994; he emphasised the importance of the fight against climate change, to which Small Island Developing States are particularly vulnerable.
This has remained Vanuatu's emphasis to this day. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly in September 2008, ni-Vanuatu President Kalkot Mataskelekele stated:
Vanuatu in the 2000s did not, however, entirely cease to promote the cause of decolonisation. In September 2004, Foreign Affairs Minister Barak Sopé, addressing the General Assembly, asked that West Papua be added once more to the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, and stated:

Gerard Béhague

Gerard Henri Béhague (November 2, 1937 in Montpellier, France - June 13, 2005 in Austin, Texas, USA) was an eminent Franco-American ethnomusicologist and professor of Latin American music. His specialty was the music of Brazil and the Andean countries and the influence of West Africa on the music of the Caribbean and South America, especially Candomblé music. His lifelong work earned him recognition as the leading scholar of Latin American ethnomusicology.
Biography.
Béhague was born in Montpellier, France and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. There he studied piano, music theory and composition at the National School of Music of the University of Brazil and the Brazilian Conservatory of Music. He earned a diploma from the latter (1959), a masters degree in musicology from the University of Paris (Sorbonne; 1962), and a Ph.D. in musicology from Tulane University (1966), where he studied under the noted music historian Gilbert Chase. In 1962, Béhague married Cecilia Pareja, a daughter of Ecuadorian writer and diplomat Alfredo Pareja Diezcanseco. 
Béhague taught music history, American music, and Latin American music at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1966 to 1974. His scholarly interests gravitated towards ethnomusicology (a new field of interdisciplinary study of music and its complex interrelationships with the cultures that produce it). He ultimately started a program there in Latin American ethnomusicology which is currently maintained by one of his protégés, former UT Austin student Robin Moore. 
Béhague joined the School of Music faculty at the University of Texas at Austin in 1974, his permanent academic position, where he was instrumental in establishing the graduate program in ethnomusicology. At UT Austin, he served as chairman of the Department of Music (1980–89), as Frank C. Erwin, Jr. Endowed Professor in Music (1985–2005) and as Virginia L. Murchison Endowed Regents Professor of Fine Arts (1995–2005). He died of lung cancer on June 13, 2005.
Scholarship.
Béhague was recognized during his later life as the leading scholar of Latin American ethnomusicology. He was particularly well known for his research on the music of Brazil, which he studied both as a music historian and as an ethnomusicologist. He served (1969–77) as associate editor of the "Yearbook for Inter-American Musical Research", and as editor (1974–78) of the journal "Ethnomusicology". In 1980 he founded, and subsequently edited, the "Latin American Music Review", a journal drawing together academics from all of the Americas to publish in three languages. He was president of the Society for Ethnomusicology (1979–81) and served on the board of directors of several other professional associations.
He trained several of the well-known Latin Americanist ethnomusicologists active today both in the United States and Latin America, and he researched and published extensively on various aspects of this field. He published two edited volumes, and two books of his own, "Music in Latin America: An Introduction" (1979), and "Heitor Villa-Lobos: The Search for Brazil's Musical Soul" (1994).
Legacy.
The Gerard Béhague and Everett Helm Latin American Sheet Music Collection, 1917-1969, is housed at the Sousa Archives and Center for World Music. This collection consists of Brazilian sheet music from the period, ca. 1915-1945, and popular Argentine sheet music from the same time period, as well as popular Cuban sheet music from the 1960s. The sheet music was purchased by the University of Illinois at the request of Béhague, who used it for his research.

The Little Sweep

The Little Sweep, Op. 45, is an opera for children in three scenes by the English composer Benjamin Britten, with a libretto by Eric Crozier.
"Let's Make an Opera!".
"The Little Sweep" is the second part of a stage production entitled "Let's Make an Opera!". The first part takes the form of a play in which the cast portray contemporary amateur performers conceiving, creating and rehearsing the opera. Intended as an introduction to and demystification of the operatic genre, the play also provides an opportunity to rehearse the audience in the four "Audience Songs" they will sing after the interval.
The format of the play altered radically in the early months of its existence, passing through at least three versions (including one specially written for radio) utilising different approaches to the exposition. An initial version set "on the stage of any village hall" during an open dress-rehearsal for an already-written work morphs into one where the "Little Sweep" narrative is related by Gladys (Mrs. Parworthy) as a true story which happened to her grandmother, Juliet Brook, when Juliet was a fourteen-year-old in 1809 or 1810. In this telling the long-term happy ending is revealed, that Juliet's uncle (the father of the visiting Crome children) took Sammy the rescued sweep-boy on as a gardener's boy. Gladys's mother remembered him as "old Samuel Sparrow, the head gardener", who used to give her apricots on her birthday. The group of six adults (including the conductor) and six children choose this as the subject of their home-made opera, libretto by Anne Dougall, a young Scottish bank clerk, and music by Norman Chaffinch, an enthusiastic amateur. The opera is written, composed, cast, produced and rehearsed in the space of less than an hour.
The adult characters in the play were given the cast members' own Christian names and invented surnames, while the children originally had the Christian names of the children in the opera. For these, Britten used the names of the children and nephews of John Gathorne-Hardy, 4th Earl of Cranbrook, a personal friend of the composer's, whose family seat of Great Glemham House lies a few miles inland from Aldeburgh, close to Snape. In later versions of the play the children also acquired the names of the respective cast members, and Elisabeth Parrish became Pamela, to reflect the part of Rowan having been taken over by Pamela Woolmore, who originally understudied the role.
Composition history.
Britten and Crozier had been thinking about a children's opera for some years, but only began to put the concept into practice in the autumn of 1948 when planning the programme for the second Aldeburgh Festival. One afternoon Britten suggested two "Songs of Innocence and of Experience" by William Blake, entitled "The Chimney Sweeper", and as Crozier relates, "by that evening we had planned the structure, action and characters of a short opera in three scenes."
As with "Albert Herring", the opera which had opened the first Aldeburgh Festival, the action was to be set locally in Suffolk, this time in Iken Hall, a large rambling farmhouse on the banks of the river Alde. The child characters were transplanted from a nearby country house, Great Glenham, which in the late eighteenth century had been the home of George Crabbe, the author of the poem "The Borough" which had formed the basis of Britten's 1945 masterpiece "Peter Grimes". Great Glemham House was (and is) the home of Lord Cranbrook, a personal friend of the composer's who was at that time Chairman of the Aldeburgh Festival. Britten and Crozier adopted the names and personas of his children and nephews for the opera (although the children themselves were not involved in the production), and the opera is "affectionately dedicated to the real Gay, Juliet, Sophie, Tina, Hughie, Jonny and Sammy – the Gathorne-Hardys of Great Glemham, Suffolk."
Musical forces.
Vocal
The enthusiastic response of the audience to the congregational hymns incorporated in the cantata "Saint Nicolas" encouraged Britten and Crozier to build on this concept, and rely on the audience themselves to provide the chorus. The five adult parts (including that of Juliet, the eldest girl) were written for five members of the English Opera Group, and the remaining six children's parts were filled by boys and girls from the Ipswich Co-operative Society Choir.
Orchestral
Britten chose modest orchestral forces; string quartet (one instrument per part), piano duet (four hands on one piano), and percussion (cymbal, tenor drum and bass drum) requiring only one player. The vocal score, published by Boosey and Hawkes in 1950, incorporates a version for two pianos and percussion, with additional notation in the piano parts for use if the percussion instruments are unavailable.
Performance history.
"The Little Sweep" was the first of Britten's operas to be entirely conceived, composed and produced at Aldeburgh. Work continued throughout the spring and the first performance was given on 14 June 1949 in the Jubilee Hall. Imogen Holst describes "a hubbub of excited comment" from the first audience as even seasoned opera-goers raised their eyebrows at the standard expected of the audience/chorus ("What! In "five-four?"" ""What?" Diminished octaves?"), and the consternation of a "tall thin music critic" uncertain of the precise "divisi" required for the four birdsong choirs in the "Night Song". The performance was a huge success, with the final "Coaching Song" in which the children on stage improvised a coach using a rocking-horse, a couple of chairs, and two parasols for the wheels, hailed as a triumph.
Synopsis.
While their mother is absent "seeing papa off to join his ship", the three Brook children of Iken Hall have been playing host to their three Crome cousins, together with their nursery-maid. The visit is due to end the following day.
Scene 1.
The first Audience Song is sung before the curtain rises to reveal the children's nursery at Iken Hall, which Rowan the nursery-maid is covering in dust-sheets in preparation for a visit from the chimney-sweeps. Miss Baggot, the elderly sharp-tongued housekeeper, escorts in Black Bob, the master-sweep, and his son Clem, "a brutal apprentice as black as his dad". Last of all Sam trails in, a small white figure struggling with an armful of buckets and rope. While Miss Baggot gives the instructions, Rowan is shocked by the wretchedness of the little boy, and begs the sweeps not to send him up the chimney. The sweeps mock her and pallid white Sammy as they drive him up his first chimney, to be transformed into a black, "chimbley-stack" boy. Rowan runs from the room in distress, and the sweeps leave to prepare the next chimney.
The door opens and Juliet enters furtively, before climbing into an armchair and covering herself with a dust-sheet. The children are playing hide-and-seek, apparently the version known as sardines. Jonny finds Juliet and joins her in her hiding-place, but their game is interrupted by a cry of distress from Sammy, who has become stuck in the chimney. The commotion attracts the other four children, and they succeed in extricating the sweep-boy from his predicament while singing the shanty "Pull the rope gently". Like Rowan, the children are horrified by Sammy's condition. They decide to hide him in the nursery while faking up a line of footprints to make it seem as if he has escaped through the window.
Miss Baggott and Rowan return with the sweeps, and are thoroughly taken in by the ruse. Black Bob and Clem run off in search of Sammy, pursued by Miss Baggott insisting that they get on with the job. Thinking herself alone, Rowan sings an aria ("Run, poor sweep-boy") expressing her wish that she could help Sam escape. Overhearing this, the children gradually emerge from under the dust-sheets and set about persuading her to help them get Sam away from the sweeps. A decision is taken to feed him and bath him, and the curtain falls on the preparations for the bath.
Scene 2.
The second Audience Song is again sung to a closed curtain, vividly describing the splashing and scrubbing which is happening out of sight. The curtain rises to reveal Sam, "whiter than swans as they fly", and Juliet begins to question him about his background. He reveals that his father is a waggoner who broke his hip so that he couldn't work, and Sammy was sold into an apprenticeship with the sweeps because "there wasn't anyting to eat". Sammy stoically declares that it was time he began work, as "I shall be nine next birthday", and the wealthy children become even more dismayed. Sam reveals that his home is in the village of Little Glemham, which by coincidence is also Rowan's home.
Jonny conceives the plan of smuggling Sam into his travelling-trunk so that he can be carried out of the house unseen when the Crome children leave the following day. Rowan agrees, just as Miss Baggott returns in a furious rage over her treatment by the sweeps, who have accused her of hiding their apprentice. There is a mad scramble to hide Sammy and look as innocent and natural as possible as Miss Baggott enters the room. At the spectacle of the grubby, sooty, untidy state of the nursery, the housekeeper's ire is redirected towards the children. Seeing toys lying around she approaches the toy-cupboard where Sammy is hiding, reaching for the door-handle. In desperation Juliet fakes a fainting fit, which has the desired effect. Everyone fusses around Juliet, who is eventually carried to her bedroom, as Jonny reassures Sam and urges him to "sit tight, and tomorrow you're a free man."
Scene 3.
The third Audience Song evokes the passing of the night. For this, the audience is divided into four groups, taking the parts of owls, herons, turtle-doves and chaffinches engaging in a singing competition. The curtain rises to reveal Juliet sitting in her dressing-gown, as Rowan enters carrying a tray with her breakfast. They call Sammy out of the cupboard and feed him Juliet's breakfast, while Juliet sings a charming farewell aria. Sammy tries to refuse the money Juliet gives him, but she is insistent. The other children enter, the three Cromes ready to leave for home. They pack Sammy into Jonny's trunk, with yet more food, only to run into a problem when it proves to be too heavy for Tom the coachman and Alfred the gardener to lift. The children and Rowan break into the growing argument between Miss Baggot and the men, and offer to help lift the trunk. The extra manpower does the trick, and Juliet, Gay and Sophie watch from the window as it is loaded into the coach taking Jonny and the twins away.
As soon as the coach has notionally departed, the entire cast returns to the stage for the Coaching Song. They form a tableau with a rocking-horse and chairs arranged to form a coach, and sing together with the audience, describing Sammy's journey to safety and freedom.

Greifswald Medical School

Greifswald Medical School () is a division of the University of Greifswald, Germany, consisting of the university's medical school and the adjacent Greifswald University Hospital. Its roots date back to the founding of the university in the year 1456, and it is therefore one of the oldest such institutions in Europe.
Institution.
The medical school has existed since the founding of the university in 1456, and is therewith one of the oldest medical schools in the world still in existence.
Admission.
The University of Greifswald's medical school is the second most requested, the most selective, and among the best-ranked in Germany. In 2007, Greifswald was ranked 2nd of 34 medical schools in Germany in terms of popularity with prospective students, out-ranking other popular universities such as the University of Heidelberg. Admission is therefore as restrictive as at some of the world's best medical schools like Harvard.
Greifswald University Hospital.
The university hospital (German: "Universitätsklinikum Greifswald"), was completely reconstructed at the new science campus east of the city centre up to the year 2011. It is therefore one of the best equipped and most up-to-date full service hospital in Germany. The university hospital recently purchased a nearby communal hospital in the city of Wolgast to increase the number of beds and treated patients. This was the first time in Germany, that a (public) university hospital bought another public hospital. The merger was first prohibited because German antitrust authorities were worried about a dominating position of the "Universitätsklinikum Greifswald" in the region. However, the decision was later revoked by a direct veto of the federal government of Germany, which is a very rare procedure.

Nesting (voting districts)

"Nesting" is the delimitation of voting districts for one elected body in order to define the voting districts for another body. For example, in California, the State Assembly (the lower house) is composed of 80 members, each one representing 1/80th of California's population, and the State Senate (the upper house) is composed of 40 members, each one representing 1/40th of California's population. In this case, the process of nesting could either be first defining the 80 Assembly districts, and then defining the Senate districts as a merge of two Assembly districts, or first defining the 40 Senate districts, and then creating the Assembly districts by splitting each Senate district into two. If the Assembly districts and the Senate districts are created independently of each other, then the process of nesting is not used.
The major concerns of nesting are:
US States which perform nesting.
The US States which have nesting (with the ratio of lower house to upper)

He was drafted out of St. Paul High School in Santa Fe Springs California by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 5th round of the 1977 Major League Baseball Draft. He was a "September Call-up" in 1980, and he pitched pretty well. He started four games, going 3–1 with a 2.61 ERA. This earned him another brief look the next year, when he had a similar 3–1 record, this time with a 1.77 ERA in five starts. That season, he was hit in the arm by a line drive from Phil Garner, thus hampering his career. The Cardinals still tried him out in the bullpen in 1982, when he started six games and relieved in five games, finishing with a 2–3 record and 4.72 ERA.

Klinefelter syndrome

Klinefelter syndrome or Klinefelter's syndrome is the set of symptoms resulting from additional X genetic material in males. Also known as 47,XXY or XXY, Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder in which there is at least one extra X chromosome to a standard human male karyotype, for a total of 47 chromosomes rather than the 46 found in genetically typical humans. While females have an XX chromosomal makeup, and males an XY, individuals with Klinefelter syndrome have at least two X chromosomes and at least one Y chromosome. Because of the extra chromosome, individuals with the condition are usually referred to as "XXY males", or "47,XXY males".
This chromosome constitution (karyotype) exists in roughly between 1:500 to 1:1000 live male births but many of these people may not show symptoms. If the physical traits associated with the syndrome become apparent, they normally appear after the onset of puberty.
In humans, 47,XXY is the most common sex chromosome aneuploidy in males and the second most common condition caused by the presence of extra chromosomes. Other mammals also have the XXY syndrome, including mice.
Principal effects include hypogonadism and sterility. A variety of other physical and behavioural differences and problems are common, though severity varies and many XXY boys have few detectable symptoms.
Signs and symptoms.
There are many variances within the XXY population, just as within the 46,XY population. While it is possible to characterise XXY males with certain body types and physical characteristics, that in itself should not be the method of identification as to whether or not someone has XXY. The only reliable method of identification is karyotype testing. The degree to which XXY males are affected, both physically and developmentally, differs widely from person to person.
Physical.
As babies and children, XXY males may have weaker muscles and reduced strength. As they grow older, they tend to become taller than average. They may have less muscle control and coordination than other boys their age.
During puberty, the physical traits of the syndrome become more evident; because these boys do not produce as much testosterone as other boys, they have a less muscular body, less facial and body hair, and broader hips. As teens, XXY males may have larger breasts, weaker bones, and a lower energy level than other boys.
By adulthood, XXY males look similar to males without the condition, although they are often taller. In adults, possible characteristics vary widely and include little to no signs of affectedness, a lanky, youthful build and facial appearance, or a rounded body type with some degree of gynecomastia (increased breast tissue). Gynecomastia is present to some extent in about a third of affected individuals, a slightly higher percentage than in the XY population. About 10% of XXY males have gynecomastia noticeable enough that they may choose to have cosmetic surgery.
Affected males are often infertile, or may have reduced fertility. Advanced reproductive assistance is sometimes possible.
The term "hypogonadism" in XXY symptoms is often misinterpreted to mean "small testicles" or "small penis". In fact, it means decreased testicular hormone/endocrine function. Because of this (primary) hypogonadism, individuals will often have a low serum testosterone level but high serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. Despite this misunderstanding of the term, however, it is true that XXY men may also have microorchidism (i.e., small testicles).
XXY males are also more likely than other men to have certain health problems, which typically affect females, such as autoimmune disorders, breast cancer, venous thromboembolic disease, and osteoporosis. In contrast to these potentially increased risks, it is currently thought that rare X-linked recessive conditions occur less frequently in XXY males than in normal XY males, since these conditions are transmitted by genes on the X chromosome, and people with two X chromosomes are typically only carriers rather than affected by these X-linked recessive conditions.
Cognitive and developmental.
Some degree of language learning or reading impairment may be present, and neuropsychological testing often reveals deficits in executive functions, although these deficits can often be overcome through early intervention. There may also be delays in motor development which can be addressed through occupational therapy and physical therapy. XXY males may sit up, crawl, and walk later than other infants; they may also struggle in school, both academically and with sports.
Cause.
The extra X chromosome is retained because of a nondisjunction event during meiosis I (gametogenesis). Nondisjunction occurs when homologous chromosomes, in this case the X and Y sex chromosomes, fail to separate, producing a sperm with an X and a Y chromosome. Fertilizing a normal (X) egg produces an XXY offspring.
The XXY chromosome arrangement is one of the most common genetic variations from the XY karyotype, occurring in about 1 in 500 live male births.
Another mechanism for retaining the extra X chromosome is through a nondisjunction event during meiosis II in the female. Nondisjunction will occur when sister chromatids on the sex chromosome, in this case an X and an X, fail to separate. (meiosis) An XX egg is produced which, when fertilized with a Y sperm, yields XXY offspring.
In mammals with more than one X chromosome, the genes on all but one X chromosome are not expressed; this is known as X inactivation. This happens in XXY males as well as normal XX females. However, in XXY males, a few genes located in the pseudoautosomal regions of their X chromosomes, have corresponding genes on their Y chromosome and are capable of being expressed.
The first published report of a man with a 47,XXY karyotype was by Patricia Jacobs and John Strong at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1959. This karyotype was found in a 24-year-old man who had signs of Klinefelter syndrome. Jacobs described her discovery of this first reported human or mammalian chromosome aneuploidy in her 1981 William Allan Memorial Award address.
Variations.
48,XXYY and 48,XXXY occur in 1 in 18,000–50,000 male births. The incidence of 49,XXXXY is 1 in 85,000 to 100,000 male births. These variations are extremely rare. Additional chromosomal material can contribute to cardiac, neurological, orthopedic and other anomalies.
Males with Klinefelter syndrome may have a mosaic 47,XXY/46,XY constitutional karyotype and varying degrees of spermatogenic failure. Mosaicism 47,XXY/46,XX with clinical features suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome is very rare. Thus far, only about 10 cases have been described in literature.
Analogous XXY syndromes are known to occur in cats—specifically, the presence of calico or tortoiseshell markings in male cats is an indicator of the relevant abnormal karyotype. As such, male cats with calico or tortoiseshell markings are a model organism for Klinefelter syndrome.
Diagnosis.
About 10% of Klinefelter cases are found by prenatal diagnosis. The first clinical features may appear in early childhood or, more frequently, during puberty, such as lack of secondary sexual characters and aspermatogenesis, while tall stature as a symptom can be hard to diagnose during puberty. Despite the presence of small testes, only a quarter of the affected males are recognized as having Klinefelter syndrome at puberty and 25% received their diagnosis in late adulthood: about 64% affected individuals are not recognized as such. Often the diagnosis is made accidentally as a result of examinations and medical visits for reasons not linked to the condition.
The standard diagnostic method is the analysis of the chromosomes' karyotype on lymphocytes. In the past, the observation of the Barr body was common practice as well. To confirm mosaicism, it is also possible to analyze the karyotype using dermal fibroblasts or testicular tissue.
Other methods may be: research of high serum levels of gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone), presence of azoospermia, determination of the sex chromatin, and prenatally via chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. A 2002 literature review of elective abortion rates found that approximately 58% of pregnancies in the United States with a diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome were terminated.
Differential diagnosis.
The symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome are often variable; therefore, a karyotype analysis should be ordered when small testes, infertility, gynecomastia, long legs/arms, developmental delay, speech/language deficits, learning disabilities/academic issues and/or behavioral issues are present in an individual. The differential diagnosis for the Klinefelter syndrome can include the following conditions: fragile X syndrome, Kallmann syndrome and Marfan syndrome. The cause of hypogonadism can be attributed to many other different medical conditions.
There have been some reports of individuals with Klinefelter syndrome who also have other chromosome abnormalities, such as Down syndrome.
Treatment.
The genetic variation is irreversible. Often individuals that have noticeable breast tissue or hypogonadism experience depression and/or social anxiety because they are outside of social norms. This is academically referred to as psychosocial morbidity. At least one study indicates that planned and timed support should be provided for young men with Klinefelter syndrome to ameliorate current poor psychosocial outcomes.
By 2010 over 100 successful pregnancies have been reported using IVF technology with surgically removed sperm material from males with Klinefelter syndrome.
Prognosis.
Children with XXY differ little from other children. Although they can face problems during adolescence, often emotional and behavioural, and difficulties at school, most of them can achieve full independence from their families in adulthood. Most can lead a normal, healthy life.
The results of a study carried out on 87 Australian adults with the syndrome shows that those who have had a diagnosis and appropriate treatment from a very young age had a significant benefit with respect to those who had been diagnosed in adulthood.
There is research suggesting Klinefelter syndrome substantially decreases life expectancy among affected individuals, though the evidence is not definitive. A 1985 publication identified a greater mortality mainly due to diseases of the aortic valve, development of tumors and possible subarachnoid hemorrhages, reducing life expectancy by about 5 years. Later studies have reduced this estimated reduction to an average of 2.1 years. These results are still questioned data, are not absolute, and will need further testing.
Epidemiology.
This syndrome, evenly spread in all ethnic groups, has a prevalence of 1-2 subjects every 1000 males in the general population. 3.1% of infertile males have Klinefelter syndrome. The syndrome is also the main cause of male hypogonadism.
According to a meta-analysis, the prevalence of the syndrome has increased over the past decades; however, this does not appear to be correlated with the increase of the age of the mother at conception, as no increase was observed in the prevalence of other trisomies of sex chromosomes (XXX and XYY).
History.
The syndrome was named after Harry Klinefelter, who, in 1942, worked with Fuller Albright at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts and first described it in the same year. The account given by Klinefelter came to be known as Klinefelter syndrome as his name appeared first on the published paper, and seminiferous tubule dysgenesis was no longer used.

Rectilinear Research Corporation

Rectilinear Research Corporation was a manufacturer of quality loudspeakers. The company was formed around 1966 and its principal was Morris I. Wiener (alt. sp. "Weiner") of Plandome Manor, New York.
The first known main office location for the company (1966–68) was at 30 Main Street, Brooklyn, New York. Some time around 1968, the company moved headquarters, manufacturing assembly, and service center to 107 Bruckner Blvd (E 133rd St.) in the Bronx. The company remained at this address until it was shuttered in 1977-8.
Arnold Schwartz (Micro-Acoustics, founded in 1966), James Bongiorno (Ampzilla, founded in 1974), Marty Gersten (Ohm Acoustics, founded 1971), Jon Dahlquist (co-founder Saul B. Marantz of Dahlquist Phased Array in 1978 ), and Richard Shahinian (later engineer designer with Harman Kardon and founder of Shahinian Acoustics at or around 1975) were at different times and at different stages working with the company as engineers to develop speaker models.
The company launched its first model, the Rectilinear III, in 1966. The early versions were designed by Arnold Schwartz and later by James Bongiorno (who also designed the Rectilinear X model).
The first known independent notice for the "III" is a retailer advertisement dated 12/4/1966. This model, as did many later Rectilinear models, received many positive reviews by audio journalists in major audio magazines, including "Stereo Review", "Popular Electronics", "Buyer's Guide" Magazine, and "Stereo & Hi-Fi Times". Three of the company's print advertisements were illustrated by the artist Rick Meyerowitz and ran in publications such as "Rolling Stone", "National Lampoon", and others in 1973 and 1974.
Although formally this model always carried the name "III", it was colloquially often nicknamed the "Highboy" following the launch of the "III Lowboy" (around 1970) in order not to confuse the two models. Both the "III "Highboy"" and "III Lowboy" are pictured here.
By 1971, Rectilinear had expanded its product range to include the following speaker models (MSRP prices per speaker):
Some of these early 3-way models featured 10" and 12" woofers manufactured by Jensen ("Flex-Air") and CTS (Chicago Telephone Supply), 5" whizzer cone squawkers manufactured by Philips Electronics of the Netherlands, and 2" and 2.5" cone tweeters by Peerless of Denmark. The Rectilinear speakers were typically, but not always, of ported design and finished in walnut with fabric or fretwork grilles. Many models featured one, or sometimes two, rear tone controls. The company offered some of their models as kits and "semi-kits".
Later models (1971 - approx. 1977) include:
The company also produced a tilted speaker stand, the "Rectilinear Dispersion Base", intended to be used with the Model 5 speaker.
Although the Rectilinear speakers were distributed through a nationwide network of up to 400 dealers, most of their sales was generated on the East Coast. Distributor in Canada was H Roy Gray Ltd., 14 Laidlaw Blvd., Markham, Ontario. International and military sales were offered by Royal Sound Co., 409 North Main St., Freeport, New York.

450th Bombardment Wing

The 450th Bombardment Wing is an inactive United States Air Force (USAF) unit. It was last assigned to the 810th Strategic Aerospace Division of Strategic Air Command (SAC) at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota. It was inactivated on 25 July 1968.
The wing was constituted as a fighter unit and activated briefly in the 1950s under Tactical Air Command (TAC) at Foster AFB, Texas, where it replaced a flying training wing. It was the first USAF combat wing to fly the North American F-100 Super Sabre.
The wing was redesignated as the Strategic Air Command (SAC) 450th Bombardment Wing and activated at Minot AFB, North Dakota in 1963, replacing the 4136th Strategic Wing taking over its Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses. It supported SAC combat operations in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. It was inactivated and replaced by the 5th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, in July 1968.
History.
Tactical Air Command.
Under Tactical Air Command, the 450th Fighter-Bomber Wing, was established and activated at Foster AFB, Texas, on 1 July 1954, replacing and absorbing the assets of Air Training Command's 3580th Pilot Training Wing. Four operational squadrons (720th, 721st, 722d and 723d) were assigned to the 450th Fighter-Bomber Group, initially equipped with the North American F-86F Sabre. Its aircraft wore an approximation of the stars and stripes, with seven red and six white stripes on the trailing edge, and three stars in white on the blue forward portion of the fin. They also were designated with a colored, scalloped nose chevron. A second group, the 322d Fighter-Day Group, with three additional F-86 squadrons, was attached to the group, although assigned to Ninth Air Force.
The primary mission of the 450th FBW was to maintain tactical proficiency for combat operations and to prepare for overseas deployments as part of Ninth Air Force. In early 1955, the 450th FBW began receiving new North American F-100C/D Super Sabre aircraft, replacing the obsolescent F-86s. The 450th FBW was the first operational Tactical Air Command wing to be equipped with the F-100. With the change of equipment, the wing was redesignated as the 450th Fighter-Day Wing on 8 March 1955, with all its subordinate groups and squadrons also being redesignated. 
At the end of 1957, its subordinate 450th Fighter-Day Group and 450th Maintenance and Supply Group were inactivated and the wing's flying and maintenance squadrons were assigned directly to the wing under the Dual Deputate organization. On 1 July 1958, the 450th was redesignated as the 450th Tactical Fighter Wing as part of a worldwide USAF naming reorganization.
On 28 August 1957, despite the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower appropriated funds for new construction at Foster, the base was ordered closed by the spring of 1959, with the resident 450th TFW inactivating. This closure was due to budgetary constraints in the Air Forces. The 450th TFW F-100 aircraft were reassigned to the 4th and 36th Tactical Fighter Wings, and all units assigned to Foster were inactivated by mid-December 1958.
Strategic Air Command.
4136th Strategic Wing
The change in the mission of the 450th to strategic bombardment began on 1 September 1958 when Strategic Air Command (SAC) established the 4136th Strategic Wing (SW) at Minot AFB, North Dakota, an Air Defense Command base, and assigned it to Fifteenth Air Force. The wing was transferred to the 821st Air Division in January, but it remained a headquarters only until June 1959, when the 906th Air Refueling Squadron, equipped with Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers and a squadron to provide security for SAC assets on the base were activated and assigned to the wing. A third squadron, the 60th Munitions Maintenance Squadron was added to look after the wing's special weapons. The wing did not become fully operational until March 1961, when the 525th Bombardment Squadron, (BS), consisting of 15 Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses moved to Minot from Homestead AFB, Florida where it had been one of the three squadrons of the 379th Bombardment Wing, and three maintenance squadrons were activated and assigned to the wing, 
This was part of SAC's plan to disperse its Boeing B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike. Half of the wing's aircraft were maintained on fifteen minute alert, fully fueled, armed, and ready for combat. The 4136th (and later the 450th) continued to maintain an alert commitment until the wing was inactivated. Because the growing SAC mission at Minot was becoming the base's predominant mission, In July 1962, SAC took over the base from ADC and formed the 862d Combat Support Group as the host for all organizations stationed there. In 1962, the wing's bombers began to be equipped with the GAM-77 Hound Dog and the GAM-72 Quail air-launched cruise missiles, The 4136th Airborne Missile Maintenance Squadron was activated in November to maintain these missiles
450th Bombardment Wing
However, SAC Strategic Wings could not carry a permanent history or lineage and SAC looked for a way to make its Strategic Wings permanent. As a result the 4136th SW was replaced by the 450th Bombardment Wing, Heavy (450th BW), which assumed its mission, personnel, and equipment on 1 February 1963.
In the same way the 720th Bombardment Squadron, one of the unit's World War II historical bomb squadrons, replaced the 525th BS. The 60th Munitions Maintenance Squadron and the 906th Air Refueling Squadron were reassigned to the 450th. The 4136th's maintenance squadrons were replaced by ones with the 450th numerical designation of the newly established wing. Each of the new units assumed the personnel, equipment, and mission of its predecessor.
The 450th Bomb Wing was assigned to SAC's 810th Strategic Aerospace Division. The wing trained in global bombardment and air refueling operations. The wing added post attack command and control system (PACCS) airborne launch control system (ALCS) missions in 1967 and began active PACCS/ALCS missions in February 1968. the 450th supported SAC combat operations in Southeast Asia by furnishing KC-135 aircraft and crews between December 1964 and July 1968, and B-52 crews, from June to July of 1968.
By 1968, Intercontinental ballistic missiles had been deployed and become operational as part of the United States' strategic triad, and the need for B-52s had been reduced. In addition, funds were also needed to cover the costs of combat operations in Southeast Asia. As part of a reduction of the B-52 force, SAC moved the 5th Bombardment Wing from Travis AFB, California to Minot in July 1968, assuming the 450th Bomb Wing's mission, personnel, and equipment. redesignation to keep the senior organization on active service.

Henry Sheehy Keating

Lieutenant General Sir Henry Sheehy Keating KCB (13 November 1775 – 12 September 1847) was born at Bansha, County Tipperary in Ireland and was an officer of the British Army during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars who served in two important operations against French colonies. The most important of his services came during the Mauritius campaign, when he commanded the troops stationed on Rodrigues, a small island use as a base by British forces during the campaign. Keating was instrumental in planning and executing a series of amphibious operations against the French held islands, culminating in the capture of both Île Bonaparte and Île de France in 1810.
Early service.
Keating joined the British Army in 1793, at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Purchasing a commission in the 33rd Regiment of Foot, Keating was almost immediately despatched to the West Indies with his regiment. Serving the campaign against French colonies in the region under Sir Charles Grey, Keating was promoted to lieutenant and fought in the invasion of Martinique, during which he was twice grievously wounded and taken prisoner by the French. While recovering from his wounds, which included a broken arm from a musket shot and a skull fracture from a shell splinter, Keating was held in a prison hulk for 18 months, before being sent to a more secure prison facility in La Rochelle.
On his return to Britain in 1796, Keating was promoted to captain. In 1800 purchased a promotion to major and was transferred to the 56th Regiment of Foot, then stationed in Ireland. Serving as a brigade major, Keating was placed in command of recruitment in County Mayo, a service for which he later received the thanks of both his senior officers and the local government. Serving through the Peace of Amiens, Keating became lieutenant colonel in command of the 56th on 1 August 1804.
Eastern service.
In 1807, Keating was sent for service in British India and in 1809 was detailed to command the land forces in a combined operation against the French held islands of Île Bonaparte and Île de France. These colonies formed a base for a powerful squadron of French frigates, which were at the time causing severe damage to British trade in the region, breaking up East Indiamen convoys and seizing ships with cargoes worth over £500,000. Keating, with a detachment of soldiers provided by the Madras government and using ships from the squadron of Commodore Josias Rowley, who was in overall command, seized the small island of Rodrigues. This provided an adequate base for British ships to operate from and for amphibious operations against the other islands to be staged.
Keating's first duty came in September 1809, when he was ordered to storm the port of Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte. This harbour was sheltering a French frigate named "Caroline" and two captured East Indiamen, but was defended by five powerful gun batteries. Keating and Rowley agreed that a frontal assault would fail, and instead devised a plan in which Keating, with 368 of his own men and 236 sailors and Royal Marines under Nesbit Willoughby would land at Point de Galet, from Saint Paul. The force would then advance and storm the batteries from the rear. The plan was a total success, Keating's men capturing each battery in turn early in the morning of 21 September and using the cannon within to fire on the shipping in the harbour. A brief attempt at defence by local forces was brushed aside, and Keating and his men re-embarked in the evening, the force remaining offshore until 28 September.
Keating also masterminded the invasion and capture of Île Bonaparte and Île de France, being seriously wounded in the latter when he was stabbed in the thigh during a skirmish. for his service in the campaign, Keating was awarded 400 guineas worth of silver plate and given the governorship of the renamed Île Bonaparte, Ile Bourbon. In 1815, at the end of the war, Keating arranged for the island's return to representatives of the restored French king, Louis XVIII.
Retirement.
In 1815, Keating was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He had continued to rise in rank, becoming a major general in 1813 and reaching lieutenant general in 1837. The year before he had been knighted, becoming a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. In April 1845, he was made honorary colonel of the 33rd Regiment of Foot. He died in September 1847 in Cheltenham aged 71. He remains are interred in the town's cemetery and a Memorial to him was erected in Christ Church, Cheltenham. He had earlier married Mary Anne Singer in Dublin, and the couple's eldest son, Henry Singer Keating later became a prominent lawyer and MP, serving twice as Solicitor General.
Portrayal in Fiction.
Keating is a secondary character in the novel The Mauritius Command by Patrick O'Brian, which portrays the Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811. He is favourably portrayed as a capable and determined commander.

Following a long period of inactivity the band reformed in 2008. Their music is a fusion of rock and pop, both foot-tapping and thought-provoking. Later that year the band performed at various venues around Scotland, and an opening slot on the bill at the 2008 Retrofest festival at Strathclyde Park. 2009 has seen the band providing support to the Blow Monkeys and Hue and Cry in May to come.
A new CD ""Stealing Seconds",", was released to coincide with the band's re-launch. Further new material is anticipated.
Back in 1982, the line-up then consisted of McNeill brothers John (guitar / vocals), Malky (keyboard / vocals) and Allan (bass /vocals), with the drum stool being occupied by Davey Halley. This was augmented later in the year, by lead guitarist Tam Watson, and his cousin Michael Quinn on saxophone.
In November 1982 they ventured into Glasgow's Park Lane studios, and recorded three songs, two of which formed their double "A" side debut single - Time Bandits and What's the Odds, on their own Tenement Toons label. Following its release, on 11 March 1983, it received overwhelming support from Radio Clyde, having featured on almost every program, but especially Richard Park (now with Magic 105.4 in London and the infamous headmaster of BBC's prime time show ‘ Fame Academy'), Mark Goodier (now morning host on 102.2 Smooth Radio in London), and Billy Sloan. Following this, the single was picked up nationally, and was played on Radio One's (the late)John Peel, David Jensen, Peter Powell and Adrian John shows. The single was also reviewed favourably by Elvis Costello on Radio Clyde.
Following the success of Time Bandits, NiteMoves in Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street became the band's home base, performing a regular Sunday night sell-out, with DJ, Richard Park.
In the summer of 1983, following a series of gigs around the country, the band were brought to the attention of Harvey Goldsmith (who featured in his very own TV series called 'Get Your Act Together' on the UK's Channel 4 ). Harvey was promoting the Rod Stewart gig at Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow, and invited the boys to play support to Rod, Gary Glitter, and Jo Boxers. Billy Connolly, also managed by Harvey Goldsmith, became a fan and was a regular source of advice and encouragement to the band.
Fueled by the success of this gig, the band signed to MCA Records and MCA Music Publishing as well as Harvey Goldsmith. In October 1983, another single, Passionate Friends, was recorded at Battery Studios in London, produced by Charlie Eyre. The single achieved the scary heights of number 28 in the Radio Clyde charts.
Extensive touring to promote the single followed, notably on the Police Synchronicity tour, at Cornwall and the NEC, Birmingham. A Hogmanay extravaganza with Big Country and RunRig at Glasgow Barrowlands, broadcast live across Europe for MTV. 2 support gigs with Nik Kershaw at Derby and Edinburgh. Television appearances saw the band feature in a schools program, "Time to Think", and performing live on the BBC's "Untied Shoelaces Show", with legendary Radio Clyde DJ, Tiger Tim. Radio broadcasts included a live concert on Radio Clyde from Glasgow's NiteMoves.
In the spring of 1984, the band commissioned New York producer Jimmy Douglass (mega producer, recently working with Justin Timberlake and Nelly Furtado). The outcome of these Jam studio sessions in London, was 3 songs White Boys making White Noise, End in Tears and Hostage.
Not long after this the band ended their association with MCA Records and their management. They eventually split in 1984. After a long spell of inactivity as the band, although the various members continued doing their own projects, the Friends are now back together again. This resulted in a series of gigs in the summer of 2008.

Gustav Knittel

Gustav Knittel (27 November 1914 — 30 June 1976) was an SS-Sturmbannführer (Major) in the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler who was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, the German Cross in Gold and the Close Combat Clasp in Gold. He was a convicted war criminal.
Early life.
Gustav Knittel was born in Neu-Ulm, in Bavaria, on 27 November 1914. He had a fraternal twin brother Bernhard and two sisters. His parents Bernhard senior and Theresia (née Pfinder) ran a bakery in Neu-Ulm, Schützenstraße 52. Knittel attended the Volksschule and Realschule in Ulm and the Oberrealschule in Göppingen.
Early career.
Knittel joined the Allgemeine SS on 15 April 1933. He believed this to be a suitable preparation for a professional military career while he was still in school. As this was a formality for new SS members he became a member of the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933. He was assigned to the 79. SS-Standarte in Ulm and with this unit he took part in the 1933 Nuremberg Rally.
Following the passing of his Abitur in March 1934 Knittel applied for a position in the Reichswehr but he was rejected. He then decided to pursue a career in what became the Waffen-SS and was transferred to the SS-Standarte Deutschland of the SS-Verfügungstruppe in Ellwangen in October 1934. He graduated from the SS-Junkerschule Bad Tölz in 1938. He returned to SS-Regiment Deutschland and with this unit Knittel took part in the occupation of the Sudetenland after the Munich Agreement. He served with various SS units before becoming adjutant of SS Reserve Battalion "Ellwangen" in August 1939.
Wartime career.
Shortly before the German invasion of France and the Low Countries Knittel was transferred to the 15th (motorcycle) company of the Leibstandarte. He was to replace Max Wünsche as a platoon commander (the other platoon commanders being Hugo Kraas and Hermann Weiser) but the transfer was postponed until after the capitulation of The Netherlands. Knittel took part in the Battle of France saw action at Wormhout and Bollezeele and was awarded the Iron cross 2nd class before he was wounded while leading the attack on Saint-Pourçain-sur-Sioule on 19 June 1940 and transported to a German field hospital in Troyes. The campaign in France also earned him the Infantry Assault Badge and the Wound Badge in black. When the commander of the 15th (motorcycle) company, Kurt Meyer, raised the Aufklärungsabteilung LSSAH (Reconnaissance Battalion LSSAH) in Metz in late 1940 he assigned Knittel as commander of the 4th (heavy) company. Knittel recovered from his leg wound in the SS hospital in Hohenlychen and returned to the Leibstandarte in November 1940.
After taking part with the Reconnaissance Battalion LSSAH in the German attack on Yugoslavia and the battle for Greece he next participated in Operation Barbarossa: the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He led his company during the drive of the Leibstandarte on Zhytomyr but was wounded during the fighting for the heights north of Marchlewsk on 11 July 1941. This time Knittel had sustained shrapnel wounds and he was shot through the right armpit. He recovered in Hohenlychen hospital again and he was then posed to the SS Training camp Dachau. He was awarded the Iron Cross 1st class and returned to his company in November.
Knittel distinguished himself on 19 November 1941 during the attack on Sultan-Sali during the battle for Rostov and later between 27 November and 1 December when he led an ad hoc Kampfgruppe (battlegroup) to defend the German retreat on Taganrog against the Red Army.
In March 1942 he was appointed as the company commander of the 3rd (light half-track) company in the Reconnaissance Battalion LSSAH. After formation of this unit at the Sennelager training grounds in Germany and further training in Normandy, Knittel led this company during the battle for Kharkov and distinguished himself between 2 and 4 February 1943. Having received orders to lead an ad hoc battlegroup formed around his company and move behind enemy lines to cover the retreat of the 298. Infanterie-Division, he made contact with this battered division in Shevchenkove, was cut off by the advancing Red Army but managed to fight his way back to the German lines with his battlegroup and a group of rescued soldiers. He further distinguished himself when the 1st SS reconnaissance Battalion LSSAH was encircled in Alexejewka and Knittel led one of the counterattacks against the Red Army on 13 February. The following day the battalion was saved from destruction because Max Wünsche managed to reach Alexejewka coming from Yefremivka with his tank regiment. On 15 February Meyer and Wünsche wanted to reach the lines of Fritz Witt and Knittel with his company was sent to Bereka to reconnoitre the planned route. He found Bereka occupied by the Red Army and he was wounded in the following attack. The next day the combined battlegroup of Meyer and Wünsche managed to reach Yefremivka. Knittel was hospitalized with a leg wound but returned to his company for the successful counterattack on Kharkov. Following the recapture of Kharkov, Emil Wawrzinek, one of the platoon commanders who served under Knittel, was awarded the German Cross in Gold.
In April 1943 Meyer left the Reconnaissance Battalion LSSAH and Knittel succeeded him as battalion commander. He was wounded on 11 July during the Battle of Kursk but stayed with his troops. Knittel led his battalion in Italy and during the 1943–1944 winter battles in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, further distinguishing himself at Turbovka and at Divin, where he personally led his men around the defensive positions of the Red Army and took the town from the east by surprise. He was awarded the German Cross in Gold on 23 January 1944.
He continued to lead the remains of his battered battalion during the battles in February and March, earning the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for securing the Bowenez Pocket between Ternopil and Proskurov on 13 March and his defence of Hill 300 south of Andrejewka between 30 March and 1 April 1944. To defend Hill 300 Knittel led the men of the 68. Infanterie-Division back into their defensive positions after they had been pushed out by the attacking Red Army. He then managed to fend off four more attacks from the Red Army that day and one more on 1 April. This enabled the German Army to safely cross the Zbruch River and retreat to Lemberg. The decimated Leibstandarte was then transferred to Belgium. Knittel set up his headquarters in Turnhout where he was awarded the Knight's Cross on 4 June 1944. His former adjutant Hans-Martin Leidreiter, who now led a company, was awarded the German Cross in gold.
The Leibstandarte was shipped to Normandy a week after D-Day and Knittel led his battalion during the German attempts to counter the allied invasion. It was in Normandy that he realized that Germany would lose the war, especially after he witnessed the devastating power of the allied fighter-bombers and artillery during Operation Lüttich and in the Falaise Pocket. After the retreat from France Knittel left for a short holiday in Neu-Ulm. He was awarded the Close Combat Clasp in gold on 13 October 1944 and he tried hard to obtain a position behind the front which he found as commander of the Field Replacement Battalion LSSAH in Lübbecke.
The Battle of the Bulge.
Divisional commander Wilhelm Mohnke ordered Knittel to return to the Leibstandarte. On 13 December 1944 he arrived at the divisional headquarters near Euskirchen where he asked Mohnke to grant Emil Wawrzinek the command of the 1st SS reconnaissance Battalion LSSAH. Wawrzinek had led the battalion since its return from France and had rebuilt it during the past months. But the next day Mohnke insisted that Knittel had to lead the reinforced battalion that would become "Schnelle Gruppe (fast group) Knittel".
That same day, 14 December, Knittel was briefed about the upcoming Operation Wacht am Rhein, the German attempt to break through the American lines and cut the allied forces in two. With the Leibstandarte as spearhead of the 6th Panzer Army of Sepp Dietrich Schnelle Gruppe Knittel was to follow the battlegroups of Joachim Peiper and Max Hansen, then use its speed to capture a bridge across the Meuse River south of Liège enabling the Leibstandarte to move toward Antwerp. On 15 December Knittel was further briefed at the headquarters of Hermann Prieß, the commanding officer of the 1st SS-Panzerkorps. During this briefing Otto Skorzeny was introduced and the details of Operation Greif were revealed. After this meeting Knittel drove to the command post of his battalion in Glaadt to pass the orders and specifics on to his company commanders.
The offensive started the next day, 16 December 1944. Initially Knittel advanced quickly, following in the wake of Peiper and Hansen without enemy contact, marching over Holzheim, Hosingen, Honsfeld and Born. On 17 December a scouting party of Schnelle Gruppe Knittel murdered eleven African-American soldiers of the 333rd Artillery Battalion in Wéreth.
On 18 December it became clear that Peiper made the best progress and Mohnke ordered Knittel to follow that battlegroup. After a short meeting with Hansen in Recht, Knittel moved to Stavelot. After leaving instructions for his company commanders he crossed the Amblève River bridge in Stavelot at noon to contact Peiper in La Gleize. Elements of his battlegroup followed during the afternoon and early evening but the American 30th Infantry Division managed to recapture the northern part of the town, blocking the advance route of the rest of Schnelle Gruppe Knittel and the battlegroup of Rudolf Sandig. The next day, 19 December, Mohnke ordered Knittel and the elements of his fast group that did manage to reach La Gleize back to Stavelot to recapture the town and open the advance route which was also essential in supplying battlegroup Peiper with fuel and ammunition. Knittel set up his command post in the Antoine Farm west of Stavelot. The counterattack he deployed failed but that day members of his battalion murdered civilians in Parfondruy, Renardmont and Stavelot. That evening the Americans demolished the bridge in Stavelot.
Increased pressure from American forces stalled the advance of the Leibstandarte and continued attempts from Knittel and Sandig to recapture Stavelot failed while Peiper had come to a halt in La Gleize. The elements of Schnelle Gruppe Knittel on the western bank of the Amblève River were trapped between Stavelot, Coo and Trois-Ponts. On 20 December Taskforce Lovelady from 3rd Armored Division attacked Knittels positions from the direction of Trois-Ponts but was halted by a King Tiger tank and some anti-tank guns positioned near Petit-Spai. That evening elements from the 82nd Airborne Division moved in on the positions near Petit-Spai and cut off the road to Wanne. On 21 December elements of the 3rd Armored Division pushed Schnelle Gruppe Knittel out of its positions in Ster but elements of Kampfgruppe Hansen had reached Petit-Spai during the night and their counterattack pushed the 82nd Airborne Division back to Trois-Ponts. On 22 December a major attack from the 30th Infantry Division threw Knittels men out of their positions at the western edge of Stavelot.
It had become clear that the Meuse River could not be reached and Peiper decided on 23 December to abandon his vehicles and march through the woods to escape capture. He left La Gleize with the remaining men. 36 hours later he reached the German lines at Petit-Spai and marched to Wanne. In the early morning of 25 December Knittel cleared his positions on the western bank of the Amblève River and withdrew his men to Wanne. There the Leibstandarte regrouped before moving to the Bastogne area. The Ardennes Offensive ended for Knittel when airplanes from the American 9th Tactical Airforce bombed his command post near Vielsalm on 31 December 1944. He was hospitalized in Germany with a serious concussion.
Trial and imprisonment.
In May 1945 Knittel returned to his family in Neu-Ulm but soon decided to hide on a farm near Stuttgart. He returned to his hometown later that year but when he met with his wife on 5 January 1946 he was captured by Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) agents Michel Thomas and Theodore Kraus. Knittel was imprisoned in the CIC prison in Ulm and interrogated by Thomas. Knittel later claimed that he was physically abused by his guards but Thomas denied this accusation.
In March Knittel was transferred to Schwäbisch Hall, where Peiper and the other suspects of the Malmedy Massacre were detained. Knittel and his Schnelle Gruppe had not taken part in the Malmedy Massacre since they had used a more southerly route but he was soon questioned about war crimes in the Stavelot area. Knittel confessed that he ordered the murder of American prisoners of war near Petit-Spai. Like other defendants he complained after his trial that the interrogations included psychological torture. Knittel claimed to have been threatened with being handed over to the Belgians and that his interrogators suggested that signing a confession or not was the choice between fair American justice and Belgian revenge. Knittel also hoped that a false confession would steer the attention of his interrogators away from the civilians the men under his command murdered in Stavelot, Parfondruy and Renardmont and that he could then show during his trial that the murders he confessed to never happened. He intended to use the war diaries of the American units which had opposed his Schnelle Gruppe during the Battle of the Bulge to prove that no Americans were murdered at the date and location he gave in his confession. But during the Malmedy massacre trial his defence lawyers did not get permission to use these war diaries and following his self-incriminating confession he was sentenced to life imprisonment on 16 July 1946.
Knittel and his lawyers immediately filed a request with the War Crimes Board of Review to have his case reopened and in March 1948 the reviewing authority reduced his sentence to 15 years imprisonment. In May 1948 the War Crimes Review Board Nr. 4 rejected the claim that irregularities had occurred during the trial against Knittel but following the Simpson Report and the findings of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services his sentence was further reduced to 12 years imprisonment. Knittel was released from Landsberg Prison on 7 December 1953 following a Christmas Amnesty.
Knittel worked as a car salesman for Opel in Ulm until health problems, including several cardiac arrests, forced him to retire in 1970. Gustav Knittel died on 30 June 1976 in Ulm hospital.

Michael Reyniersz Pauw

Knight Michiel Reiniersz Pauw (29 March 1590, Amsterdam - 20 March 1640, Amsterdam) was a burgermeester of Amsterdam and a director of the Dutch West India Company (WIC).
He was born in Amsterdam in a rich merchant family - his father, Reinier Pauw (1564–1636) wasn't only a merchant, but also a Mayor of Amsterdam - and studied law in Leiden.
His brother Adriaan Pauw
The WIC was founded in 1621 to exploit trade in the Western Hemisphere, and by 1625 had established a colony at Fort Amsterdam (Lower Manhattan) and Fort Orange. In the hope of encouraging settlement the company, in 1629, started to offer vast land grants and the feudal title of patroon. under the auspices of the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions. In 1630, Pauw purchased two tracts from the Lenape at Hopoghan Hackingh (Hoboken) and at Ashasimus (Harsimus), though the patroonship likely included the entire peninsula between the Hudson River and Hackensack River now known as Hudson County, New Jersey, and possibly his holdings on Staten Eylandt (Staten Island). It was given the Latinized form of his surname (which means "peacock"), Pavonia. It is said it was sold to him by the Manhattans after they had retreated there after the sale of their home island to Peter Minuit some years before. Initially, a small hut and ferry landing were built at Arresick, called Powles Hoek (Paulus Hook), but Pauw failed to fulfill the other conditions set forth by the company (which included populating the area with at least fifty adults), and was later required to sell his interests back to it.
In 1634 he collaborated with Kiliaen van Rensselaer and Wouter van Twiller in sending cattle (horses and cows) in the next six years.
The name Pavonia remains as an avenue and library branch in contemporary Jersey City. There is also a Pavonia Court in Bayonne and Pavonia Avenue in Kearny. Erie Railroad's Hudson waterfront terminus was called Pavonia Terminal located nearby PATH rapid transit system's station once called Pavonia. Saint Peter's College, located on land that was part of the patroonship, has as its mascot a peacock.
Pavonia was not the only American territory that would bear his name.
First described by Amerigo Vespucci, who traveled with a Portuguese expedition of Gonçalo Coelho to Brazil in the year 1503, the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago was invaded by the English, and from 1556 until 1612, was held by the French. In 1628, it was occupied by the Dutch, who were displaced two years later by a Spanish-Portuguese military expedition led by Rui Calaza Borges. The Dutch occupied the island once again in 1635, making it a hospital for their troops who occupied Northeastern Brazil (the Brazilian coast between Rio São Francisco and Maranhão). The island became known as "Pavonia", in honor of Pauw. It would remain under Dutch control for nearly twenty years, when it was reconquered by Portugal.
Pauw was apparently very successful, and was able to commission one of the most popular architects of the period to build a "grachtenpand", or canal house, in Amsterdam. It may be seen in the two lead images for this article. Clad in white sandstone imported from Germany it, was the first in the city to have a "neck" gable.

Mike Chris

Michael Chris (Born: October 8, 1957 in Santa Monica, California) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who attended the West Los Angeles Junior College. He appeared in games in three Major League seasons, starting approximately half of the games. The Detroit Tigers drafted him with the 10th overall pick of the 1977 Major League Baseball Draft and promoted him to the majors in 1979 to pitch in 13 games, starting eight. He did not impress, finishing with record of three wins against three losses, with a 6.92 ERA. The Tigers finally traded him to the San Francisco Giants in 1981 with Dan Schatzeder for Larry Herndon. He pitched in part of two seasons for the Tigers, but they placed him on waivers in 1983. The Chicago Cubs claimed him, but he never pitched for the Cubs, and they released him in the offseason.
Chris is noteworthy for having been drafted four times in the Major League Baseball Draft in three years, by three different teams. The Oakland Athletics drafted him twice, in 1975 and 1976. In 1976, he was drafted twice in secondary phases of the draft, declining first to sign with the California Angels and then declining to sign with the A's. He finally signed with the Detroit Tigers after they selected him in the first round of the 1977 draft.

The Venice Marathon () is a marathon road race that has been held each year in Venice since 1986, usually in October. The race is currently sponsored by Casino di Venezia (Venice Casino), and thus it is known as the Casino di Venezia Venice Marathon. Ponte della Libertà and Parco San Giuliano are among the landmarks which are featured on the course. The competition celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2010 and that year it hosted the men's Italian marathon championships, which was won by Migidio Bourifa.
Since 2000, East African runners have dominated the elite races – Moroccan-born Frenchman El Hassan Lahssini is the only men's winner outside of this region since 1998. The course records are both held by Kenyans: John Komen holds the men's record of 2:08:13 hours while Helena Kirop is the women's holder with 2:23:37.

John Elliott (cricketer)

John William Elliott (born 12 February 1942) was an English cricketer who played ten first-class matches for Worcestershire between 1959 and 1965, although he played for the county's Second XI as late as 1971.
He made his first-class debut against Somerset aged just 17, though then did not play at that level again for two years.
Elliott claimed six of his 26 first-class dismissals in a single match, and five in a single innings. This feat came against the Pakistan Eaglets in 1963.
He was not a good batsman: in 11 first-class innings he reached double figures just twice.

Women of Valor

Women of Valor is a 1986 CBS-TV movie about World War II, starring Susan Sarandon and Kristy McNichol and directed by Buzz Kulik. It premièred on November 23, 1986 and was released on DVD on March 10, 1998.
Plot.
A group of American Army nurses are captured by the Japanese in April 1942. They are put in a prisoner-of-war camp in Bataan, where they spend three years of their lives. The story focuses on Lt Margaret Ann "Maggie" Jessup, the head army nurse who survived the camp and testifies against the Japanese in front of the United States Congressional subcommittee years later as a colonel.
Criticism.
The film was generally negatively received. One of the main criticisms was that the film was not realistic. The cast was also criticized for retaining their looks while trying to survive in poor conditions. "The New York Times" also stated the film should have given more attention to the persons rather than the situations.

Abel Collin

Abel Collin (1653-1705) was a benefactor in Nottingham. He established Abel Collin's Charity.
Family.
He was the son of Laurence Collin.
His sister, Fortune Collin, married Thomas Smith, founder of Smith's Bank in Nottingham.
History of the Charity.
By his Will, published in 1704, twenty four alms houses were built in Nottingham. The initial purchase of land was made by Thomas Smith in 1708 for the purpose of building some little houses and endowing same for some poor men or women to dwell in.
As time went on, further land and property was purchased. In 1709 a new building was erected on Friar Lane. In 1831 the Almshouses on Carrington Street were largely rebuilt. Early in 1909 the 80 years leases of the Nottingham property fell in, the income from that source increasing sevenfold. £17,000 (£ as of ), was also received from the Nottingham Corporation for land acquired for street widening and taken largely out of the ground of the almshouses.
The site occupied by twenty almshouses in Carrington Street was sold and new houses were erected on Derby Road, Beeston.
In 1954, the remainder of the Almshouses on Carrington Street were demolished. In 1956, the Almshouses on Friar Lane were demolished to create room for Maid Marian Way. Pevsner thought that this was one of the best almshouses of its date in England.
Current status.
The Charity "The United Charities of Abel Collin" still exists over 300 years from its founding. It is the oldest charity in Nottingham.
It now has 63 houses and bungalows in Beeston, Nottingham. Four bungalows were completed in 2010 - designed by the Nottingham firm Marsh Grochowski for the tercentenary year.
The charity is run by a board of Trustees, the current Chairman is Colin Muge.

Thomas Coughtrie

Thomas Robb Coughtrie (25 November 1917 – 27 August 2008) was credited by the Times as the inventor of the Mole wrench.
However, this conflicts with other references that show the invention of the Vise Grip in Nebraska with an initial patent in 1921 and fuller developments patented in 1924.
It could be surmised that M. K. Mole and Son produced their own version (the Mole Grip) based on the existing American Vise Grip. The likeness between the two is clear even from sketch drawings.
He was born in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland. After his education at Bellshill Academy he qualified as a chartered engineer.
During the Second World War, he was an electrical engineer involved in the maintenance of 1,000 ton 'Whale' floating roadways for Mulberry harbours.
In 1947 he started working for the Birmingham engineering firm 'M. K. Mole and Son', founded in 1835. When the second Mole brother died in 1950 he became managing director of the company. In 1955 he patented the self-grip wrench.
In 1960 the Mole company, and Coughtrie, relocated to Newport, South Wales.
He became a director of Cwmbrân New Town, governor of four local technical colleges and, in 1978, deputy lieutenant for Gwent.

<doc id="19833982" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19833982" title="Antoine equation">
Antoine equation

The Antoine equation
is a vapor pressure equation and describes the relation between vapor pressure and temperature for pure components. The Antoine equation is derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation.
The equation.
where "p" is the vapor pressure, "T" is temperature and "A", "B" and "C" are component-specific constants.
The simplified form with "C" set to zero:
is named the August equation, after the German physicist Ernst Ferdinand August (1795–1870). The August equation describes a linear relation between the logarithm of the pressure and the reciprocal temperature. This assumes a temperature-independent heat of vaporization. The Antoine equation allows an improved, but still inexact description of the change of the heat of vaporization with the temperature.
The Antoine equation can also be transformed in a temperature-explicit form with simple algebraic manipulations:
Validity range.
Usually, the Antoine equation cannot be used to describe the entire saturated vapour pressure curve from the triple point to the critical point, because it is not flexible enough. Therefore, multiple parameter sets for a single component are commonly used. A low-pressure parameter set is used to describe the vapour pressure curve up to the normal boiling point and the second set of parameters is used for the range from the normal boiling point to the critical point.
Example parameters.
The constants are given in °C and mmHg.
Example calculation.
The normal boiling point of ethanol is "T"B = 78.32 °C.
This example shows a severe problem caused by using two different sets of coefficients. The described vapor pressure is not continuous—at the normal boiling point the two sets give different results. This causes severe problems for computational techniques which rely on a continuous vapor pressure curve.
Two solutions are possible: The first approach uses a single Antoine parameter set over a larger temperature range and accepts the increased deviation between calculated and real vapor pressures. A variant of this single set approach is using a special parameter set fitted for the examined temperature range. The second solution is switching to another vapor pressure equation with more than three parameters. Commonly used are simple extensions of the Antoine equation (see below) and the equations of DIPPR or Wagner.
Units.
The coefficients of Antoine's equation are normally given in mmHg—even today where the SI is recommended and pascals are preferred. The usage of the pre-SI units has only historic reasons and originates directly from Antoine's original publication.
It is however easy to convert the parameters to different pressure and temperature units. For switching from degrees Celsius to kelvin it is sufficient to subtract 273.15 from the C parameter. For switching from millimeters of mercury to pascals it is sufficient to add the common logarithm of the factor between both units to the A parameter:
formula_6
The parameters for °C and mmHg for ethanol
are converted for K and Pa to
The first example calculation with "T"B = 351.47 K becomes
A similarly simple transformation can be used if the common logarithm should be exchanged by the natural logarithm. It is sufficient to multiply the A and B parameters by ln(10) = 2.302585.
The example calculation with the converted parameters (for K and Pa):
becomes
(The small differences in the results are only caused by the used limited precision of the coefficients).
Extension of the Antoine equations.
To overcome the limits of the Antoine equation some simple extension by additional terms are used:
The additional parameters increase the flexibility of the equation and allow the description of the entire vapor pressure curve. The extended equation forms can be reduced to the original form by setting the additional parameters "D", "E" and "F" to 0.
A further difference is that the extended equations use the e as base for the exponential function and the natural logarithm. This doesn't affect the equation form.

Onavillu

The Onavillu is a simple, short bow-shaped musical instrument. Its name may come from "Onam" and "Villu", since it is used in dances in Kerala during the Onam festival, and Villu means bow. Although still regularly used in rural art forms, use of the Onavillu is on the decline.
'Onavillu' also refers to flat, tapered wooden artifacts decorated with tassels and used in ceremonies of devotion to Lord Vishnu.
Instrument.
The Onavillu that accompanies the Kummattikali and other folk dances is a Kerala string instrument made from the pith of the palmyra stem, or from bamboo, shaped as a bow. Bamboo slivers are used for bowstrings. The bow strings sound when struck with a thin stick, the size of a pencil. The sound can be varied through finger pressure on the string.
Ceremonial Bow.
The ceremonial Onavillu, which is not a musical instrument, is made from a flat piece of wood 1/2 inch thick, tapering on both sides. Sizes range from 3.5 feet by 4 inches to 4.5 feet by 6 inches. The wood of kadambu, maruthu, jack fruit, and aanjili trees are preferred (See List of Indian timber trees). The wood is cut to the required dimension before being decorated with miniature paintings of Anantha Sayanam (reclining pose of Lord Vishnu) and avatars Dasavatharam, Shri Rama Pattabhishekam and Shri Krishna Leela. Convicts in the central jail at Poojappura make the red tassels used to adorn the bows.
The making of the ceremonial bows is the preserve of a local family.
Legend.
According to legend, when King Mahabali was being pushed into the earth by Vamana, Lord Vishnu appeared before him. King Mahabali asked that each year he could be allowed to visit his native land and to see the Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu granted him the boon, but said that the King would be able to see him and his avatars only as painted images. Lord Vishvakarman was ordered to paint images of Dasavatharam on pieces of kadambu wood. This was the origin of the Onavillu, which is put on display every year for King Mahabali to see.
Ceremonial Use.
On Thiruvonam day, the birthday of Lord Maha Vishnu, large number of devotees visit the Sri Padmanabha Swamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India to take part in the Onavillu charthal or the dedication ceremony of the colourful bows. The temple is one of the 108 sacred temples dedicated to Lord Mahavishnu. The bows are first offered to the family deity at the Vilayil Veedu,Karamana for three days. They are then taken to Sri Padmanabha Swamy temple on Thiru Onam day and displayed at the Natakasala before being offered to the deity. 
The Anantha Sayanam version of the villu is consecrated to Lord Padmanabha (Vishnu); the one with the Dasavathram painting is offered to Lord Narasimha; the one showing the Krishna-leela is dedicated to Lord Krishna; the one with the painting of Shri Rama Pattabhishekam is consecrated to the idol of Shri Rama. 
The Onavillu are removed on the third day. The Temple Trust distributes the Onavillu to devotees, who consider them a symbol of prosperity.

USS W. W. Burns (1861)

USS "W. W. Burns" was a schooner acquired by the United States Navy in 1861.
"W. W. Burns" was a wooden-hulled Chesapeake Bay schooner acquired by the U.S. Navy on 13 August 1861 at Baltimore, Maryland for use as stone-laden blockship during the American Civil War. The purchase of "W. W. Burns" was one of 22 made at Baltimore in the summer of 1861, and she and the other 21 ships were slated to be loaded with stone, taken to the North Carolina coast, and sunk as blockships off the entrances to the major inlets leading to Albemarle Sound, Pamlico Sound, and Okracoke Sound. The venture was the first of the "stone fleet" projects undertaken by the U.S. Navy during the Civil War, but, due to delays and other problems, it failed.
Some of the 22 ships seem to have remained at their anchorages in Hampton Roads, Virginia, and deteriorated late that summer and into the autumn of 1861. The ultimate fate of "W. W. Burns" is unrecorded.

1997 Ardabil earthquake

The 1997 Ardabil earthquake was a destructive earthquake that occurred on 28 February 1997. The epicenter was located near the city of Ardabil in northern Iran.
Background and tectonics.
Ardabil and the surrounding province which bears its name are agricultural lands, primarily populated by Azeris. Two other earthquakes damaged northern Iran the month before, killing at least 79 people.
Damage and casualties.
The earthquake occurred at 12:57 UTC (4:27 p.m. Iran Standard Time) and lasted for 15 seconds. At least 1,100 people were killed, 2,600 injured, 36,000 homeless, 12,000 houses damaged or destroyed and 160,000 livestock killed in the Ardabil area of northwestern Iran. Severe damage was observed to roads, electrical power lines, communications and water distribution systems around Ardabil. Hospitals and other medical buildings were overflowing with patients as a result of the earthquake. More than 83 villages experienced some form of damage.
Within the village of Villadareh, 85 corpses were recovered from the rubble. In Varania, another small village near the epicenter that had previously had a population of 85, all but 20 residents had perished.
Aftershocks.
Roughly 350 aftershocks followed the main Ardabil earthquake. The largest one had a magnitude of 5.2 on the Richter scale. Aid workers and rescuers approximate death toll as high as 3000. 
Aftermath and relief efforts.
In the aftermath of the tremor, of snow fell, hampering rescue efforts. The Iranian government declared three days of mourning to honor victims. Iranian president visited the damaged area on 4 March. Rescue workers at the scene disputed the official government death toll, claiming it was as much as three times higher.
Nonetheless, head of the Iranian Branch of Red Crescent Seifollah Vahid Dastjerdi was satisfied with the pace of relief work. More than 8,700 tents, 21,800 blankets, 15,300 heaters and lanterns, 2,000 bottles of baby formula and 80 tons of bread were given to the victims. Additionally, 60 ambulances, 127 trucks and vans and two helicopters transported victims, relief workers, and supplies to and from the affected region.
Air crash.
On 3 March, a small aircraft on a relief mission crashed about 16 miles (25 km) northeast of Ardabil. Its wreckage was discovered the following day. There were four people on board the Falcon aircraft but no survivors. The crash was blamed on poor weather and heavy snowfall.

British International School Vietnam

The British International School (BIS), Ho Chi Minh City is an international school in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, offering a British style education. The school has three campuses located in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). One Primary campus is located in District 3 of the city, whilst a second Primary campus and a Secondary campus are located in the residential area of District 2. BIS was founded in 1997 as Tiny Tots, a Kindergarten. Beginning with only two classes, two overseas teachers and 40 toddlers, it has since grown to become a private day school with over 1,800 students from 52 countries. Both Primary campuses cater for students from the Foundation Stage (Pre-school) through to Year 6 and the Secondary campus caters for students from Years 7-13. BIS has 161 full-time teachers, most of whom are British qualified. BIS teaches the National Curriculum of England and students take both the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) examinations and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. BIS is accredited through the Council of International Schools (CIS). The school is a registered centre for the UK examination boards, Cambridge International Examinations. It is also designated as an IB World School. It is a member of the Federation of British International Schools in South East Asia (FOBISSEA).
History.
In August 1997, a pre-school named Tiny Tots was established in a villa on Nguyen Van Thu Street in District 1 of Ho Chi Minh City - starting with just two classes, two teachers from overseas and 40 toddlers. Building on this success, a second pre-school named Fundino was soon established in District 3. The original Tiny Tots villa was extended in 2000 to accommodate 10 additional primary classrooms, bringing the total number of students to 300 children. This was the first year the school was officially called the British International School, with Marjorie Hunt being the first Head Teacher.
Two years later, a new Primary campus was built in the residential An Phu area of the city. Alun Thomas was appointed as Principal of the three campuses and enrolment reached 600 children. In August of 2005, a purpose built Secondary campus was opened on land very close to the new Primary campus in An Phu.
In August 2007, another new Primary campus was built on Tu Xuong Street in District 3, combining the Nguyen Van Thu campus and the Fundino campus into one new school. Mr Shaun Williams was appointed as Principal, and the school roll rose to 1,350 children, with ages ranging from 2 to 18.
In 2008, an extension to the An Phu Primary campus was opened followed by an extension to the An Phu Secondary campus in August 2010. These extensions provided additional classrooms and specialist facilities allowing the school to grow towards its projected target of 2,000 students. 
Facilities.
All of the school campuses have: 
Early Years Foundation Stage.
Both primary campuses also have:
Secondary.
The Secondary Campus has further facilities, including: 
Extra Curricular Activities.
BIS offers numerous extra-curricular activities from Year 1 onwards.
and many more.
Curriculum.
The British International School, Ho Chi Minh City teaches children from the ages of 2 years old (Pre-Nursery) through to 18 years old (Year 13). These are split into three areas of learning, Foundation from age 2 to 4+, Primary from age 5 to 10+ and Secondary from age 11 to 18.
The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), for children under the age of 4, provides a base from which students can move into primary school. An adapted form of the National Curriculum for England . In our Primary campuses this is achieved through the use of the International Primary Curriculum (IPC), which is a modified curriculum for schools wishing to place the National Curriculum for England into an international context.
Secondary education consists of three distinct, consecutive phases:
Year 7 (age 11-12), Year 8 (age 12-13) and Year 9 (age 13-14). The English National Curriculum is taught with the following subjects offered - English, Mathematics and coordinated Science (Biology, Chemistry and Physics) French/Mandarin/Spanish, Geography/History, Art/ICT, DT/Music, PE/Vietnamese, and ILS/Assembly/Drama. 
Year 10 and Year 11 (age 14-16). Students study for the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) examinations. Students follow the IGCSE course, provided by Cambridge University, UK which includes the compulsory subjects of English, Mathematics and coordinated Science in addition to four subjects chosen from a selection of options.
Year 12 and Year 13 (age 16-18). Upon successfully completing their IGCSE’s, students then enter the IB Diploma Programme (IBDP). Compulsory subjects for this course are Mathematics, English and a second language. Students then choose three further subjects from a list of options that are provided each year. The IBDP is internationally recognized and allows students access to the very best universities worldwide. 
Inter-school involvements.
Inter-house sporting competitions and fixtures against other schools in Ho Chi Minh City occur on a regular basis as well as regional games. The school is also involved in the Federation of British International Schools in South East Asia (FOBISSEA), with sports and music.
BIS was the founding school of SAIMUN (HCMC Model United Nations). SAIMUN is the only MUN conference held in Vietnam, and was established in 2009. In addition, BIS established and hosted the 1st Annual FOBISSEA MUN 2010.
BIS is also the host of the annual ABRSM High Scorers' Concerts in Ho Chi Minh City, which feature the top 25 scoring musicians.

Charles II Gonzaga (1609–1631) was the son of Charles I, Duke of Mantua and Catherine of Lorraine (also known as Catherine of Mayenne), he was the Duke of Nevers and Rethel, together with his father.
In 1621, he succeeded his uncle Henry of Lorraine as Duke of Mayenne.<br> 
In 1627 he married his cousin Maria Gonzaga, inheritor to the Duchy of Mantua and the Marquisate of Montferrat. However, Cesare II Gonzaga, Duke of Guastalla and emperor Ferdinand II did not accept this succession line, leading to the War of Mantuan Succession (1628–1631).
Charles was never the proper Duke of Mantua since he died at Cavriana six years before his father. When the latter died in 1637, Charles's eight-year-old son, Charles II, became Duke of Mantua, his widow Maria acting as regent. His daughter Eleonora became Holy Roman Empress.
Family.
In December 1627 he married his cousin Maria Gonzaga, the marriage being arranged by Vincenzo II Gonzaga.
