Yi Yuanji

Yi Yuanji (; Wade-Giles: I Yüan-chi) (c. 1000, Changsha, Hunan – c. 1064) was a Northern Song Dynasty painter, famous for his realistic paintings of animals. According to Robert van Gulik, Yi Yuanji's paintings of gibbons were particularly celebrated.
The 11th-century critic Guo Ruoxu (郭若虚) in his "Overview of Painting" (图画见闻志, "Tuhua Jian Wen Zhi") tells this about Yi's career:
He spent months roaming the mountains of southern Hubei and northern Hunan, watching roebucks (獐鹿) and gibbons (猿狖) in their natural environment.
In 1064, Yi Yuanji was invited to paint screens in the imperial palace. Once this job has been completed, the Yingzong Emperor, impressed, commissioned him to paint the "Picture of a Hundred Gibbons", but unfortunately the artist died after painting only a few gibbons. A few of his other gibbon paintings have survived, and Robert van Gulik, quite familiar with the behavior of this ape, comments on how naturally they look in the pictures. His other work includes depictions of deer, peacocks, birds-and-flowers and fruits-and-vegetables; many of them are kept in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. The "Monkey and Cats" painting is especially charming. Van Gulik identifies the monkey as a macaque. This painting was featured on a 2004 "Year of the Monkey" stamp from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
The image of Yi Yuanji, with his intimate knowledge of nature, has attracted attention from modern Chinese painters.

SM-130,686

SM-130,686 is a drug which acts as a potent, orally active growth hormone secretagogue, with around half the potency of the endogenous agonist ghrelin as a stimulator of growth hormone release. It produces dose-dependent increases in muscle mass and decrease in body fat, and is under investigation for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency and other medical conditions. Concerns about its potential use as a performance-enhancing drug for athletes have led to the development of urine tests for SM-130,686 and other growth hormone secretagogues, even though no drugs from this class have yet progressed to clinical use.

The collective seems to have splintered, as internal conflicts have led to the breakup of groups (for example, Little Brother) and general dissent within the Justus League. Also individual members have stated that the time of this collective has passed and that they have moved on, according to Chaundon in an online interview. Several members are still with Hall Of Justus, however the rest of the crew seems to have left and are pursuing separate musical endeavors.

Craig Bloxom was born in Ingelwood, Los Angeles on 31 July 1959 to George William and Arliene Dorlores (née Dreger). The family moved to Australia in 1965 to escape rising crime in the Los Angeles at the time. After growing up in Perth, Western Australia and later Nelson Bay, New South Wales, he met Mike Weiley at high school and moved to Sydney, where they joined Cliff Grigg, who happened to live in a squat in the inner Sydney suburb of Glebe. As a rent saving device Bloxom and Weiley also moved into Grigg's squat, it also became their rehearsal site.
Spy vs Spy: 1981–2003.

The Torment

The Torment is the first studio album by the British thrash metal band Seventh Angel, released on Music for Nations label in 1990. The album established the band as "one of England's leading thrash metal bands" by "The Daily Telegraph". In 2010, "HM Magazine" ranked it number 51 on the Top 100 Christian Metal Albums of All Time list.
Recording.
After signing with Under One Flag, a subsidiary label of Music for Nations, Seventh Angel recorded the debut at Mad Hat Sudios, Wolverhampton, with producer Paul Hodson. The coverart was done by Rodney Matthews. The album features plenty of tempo changes, progressive elements and considerable amount of deathrash leanings.
Reception.
In a review published on 1 September 1990 in "Cross Rhythms" magazine, Brian Hoff gave the album 8 points out of 10 and stated he was impressed by the music and lyrics. He wrote that "there can be no doubt about it, this album is going to offend, shock, worry and disgust some people", referring to lyrics that "smack you straight between the eyes and tell it as it is." For example, "Dr Hatchet" is a song which accuses those in the medical profession who perform abortions of being cold blooded murderers. According to Hoff, the song caused "much controversy amongst certain so-called Christian event organizers." Musically, Hoff felt that the only thing that needed cricism was Ian Arkleys vocals: "These are excellent for the thrash numbers, but unlike his guitar work, lack the range, imagination and musicality to cope with a track like 'Katie' where some real vocal dexterity is called for, Ian sounds more like he's talking or doing a 'Make Way' chant than singing." After the release, the British newspaper "The Daily Telegraph" wrote that Seventh Angel is one of England's leading Christian thrash metal bands. "The Torment" achieved notable mainstream distribution.
Later, Ian Arkley has stated in interviews that he regrets the album's lyrics because he was "young and reckless" at the time he wrote them. Eventually, the lyrical style would become more subtle on the second album "Lament for the Weary".
Tour.
During the months following the album's release, the band played concerts in Dudley and Stourbridge, 5 times in Brierley Hill's The Rock Tavern club. In November 1990, Seventh Angel headlined Metal Meltdown festival.
In February 1991, Seventh Angel appeared on BBC TV four times with video material recorded at Metal Meltdown festival. "Forbidden Desires" was the selected song.

Llwynywermod, (), also known as Llwynywormwood, is an estate owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, just outside the Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales.
The estate is near the village of Myddfai, Llandovery, Carmarthenshire; the Duchy completed its purchase of the property in March 2007. The three-bedroom farmhouse was converted into a residence for Charles, Prince of Wales, who is also the Duke of Cornwall, by Craig Hamilton Architects using traditional building techniques. It was once the coach house to the now ruined 13-bedroom country house of the Griffies-Williams family that stood nearby.
Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, took up residence at the property in June 2008.
The courtyard range adjoining the main house is let as holiday accommodation when the Prince is not in residence.
The historian Mark Baker has written a book detailing the history of the estate and restoration, entitled "A Royal Home in Wales: Llwynywermod". It was originally commissioned by the Welsh Historic Gardens Trust, who presented a special leather-bound copy to the Prince of Wales in February 2008.

Hedge fund industry in China

Hedge funds started in China in the early 1990s, and has so far undergone four stages: infancy, formation, rapid expansion, and adjustment and standardization.
Categories.
Currently hedge funds in China fall into two categories. One is those companies backed up by the government, including brokers managing pooled property, trust and investment companies' trust and investment projects, and investment companies managing their own capital. The other is private hedge funds. Under the name of "Investment Consulting Company" or "Investment Management Company", they provide management for pooled property.
Economic growth trend.
Against the background of China's fast growing economy, the number of hedge fund investors is increasing rapidly in the country, and the total amount of their wealth is increasing in step. By the end of June 2008, China's residents had RMB 19,460bn ($2,820bn) in bank deposits, of which 80% was in the name of 20% of the population. With such a huge amount of cash assets in hand, the wealthy's strong investment demand has provided hedge funds in China with a sufficient supply of capital. In addition, China's companies also have a huge sum of spare cash, which is also a primary source of capital for hedge funds.
Share of GDP.
Data showed that hedge funds account for 0.6% of the GDP in the USA, 0.35% in Europe, 0.2% in Asia, while only 0.1% in China. It is expected that China's GDP would quadruple in 10 years time and hedge funds would be about 0.4% of the country's GDP. [http://www.pr-inside.com/report-on-china-s-hedge-fund-r894061.htm] In this case, China's hedge funds would expand 12-fold, and place China second in the world for hedge fund investments.

"One Second of Insanity" (also styled as "1 Second of Insanity") was the second single from the debut album, "Begins Here", by Australian rock group, The Butterfly Effect and was released in 2003. Though the track failed to appear on the ARIA Singles Chart, it was ranked at No. 68 on the Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2003. The national radio station, Triple J, had played it, as a radio-only release, which had a limited run of 500 CD single units pressed.
The single was also released in the United Kingdom and Europe on 19 August 2004 on Modern Music.
Background.
"One Second of Insanity" was the second single from the debut album, "Begins Here", by Australian rock group, The Butterfly Effect and was released in 2003. The Brisbane-based band were formed in 1999 by Clint Boge on guitar, Glenn Esmond on bass guitar and vocals, Kurt Goedhart on guitar and Ben Hall on drums. They spent November 2002 to March 2003 recording their debut album at Modern Music Studios. The album was released in Australia on 4 August 2003 and debuted at No. 24 on the ARIA Albums Chart.
The single was played by national radio station, Triple J, and appeared at No. 68 on the Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2003. "One Second of Insanity" was written by Goedhart, Boge, Hall and Esmond.
The single was also released in the United Kingdom and Europe on 23 August 2004. musicOMH's Sacha Esterson reviewed the album and declared that "One Second of Insanity" was "very short, and that's probably a good thing. It lacks the quality shown in the rest of the tracks, and loses steam after about one minute". Chris Linosi (musicOMH) describes the song as being "short, sharp and may well have its 15 minutes of fame, but it's bordering on the average and it in no way reflects the maturity of the rest of their debut album". 
The song was also featured in the second season of the Australian television drama series, "Love My Way".

1936–37 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1936-37 campaign was a season that saw Town fight for their league status in Division 1. They finished 15th, a far cry from their 3rd place finish the previous season.
Review.
Town's 8th season under Clem Stephenson was another season of mediocrity, which had been continued for most of the previous few seasons with the exception of the previous season's 3rd place finish. With no FA Cup run to fall back on either, Town were down in a relegation dogfight with nearly half the teams in the division, but luckily the records of Manchester United and Sheffield Wednesday were worse enough to see them drop down to Division 2.

Burchellia

Burchellia is a genus in the family Rubiaceae, native to the Cape floristic region of southernmost Africa. It contains a single species, Burchellia bubalina, commonly named the "wild pomegranate" (English) or "wildegranaat" (Afrikaans). The species is widely cultivated in frost-free gardens as an ornamental tree, and has become a weed in some regions.
A small shrub or tree to 8 metres, the species has red flowers, grey-green bark and dark green leaves.
This name was revised by John Sims in the species' first description in "Curtis's Botanical Magazine" in 1822. He gives this account of the earlier taxonomic history:In the "Supplementum Plantarum" of the younger Linnæus this plant was referred to the genus "Lonicera", but as it belongs to the natural order of Rubiaceae it will by no means associate with that genus. Persoon joined it with Swartz's "Cephælis", the "Tapocomea" of Aublet and Bernard de Jussieu; but Mr. Brown not finding it to accord with any established genus, has considered it as distinct from any, and given it the name of "Burchellia" in honour of Mr. Burchell, a very enterprising traveller in Southern Africa, who has favoured the public with an interesting account of his travels in that country. And, certainly, persons who, in spite of deprivations and difficulties, spend a large portion of their valuable time in such hazardous undertakings, for the promotion of science, merit this only reward of the botanist; but we can by no means approve of altering the specific name, which, when once established, should remain inviolate, except for very particular reasons; we have therefore thought it right to restore the name of bubalina.
[[Image:Botanical Magazine 2339 (pl) Burchellia bubalina.png|thumb|Pl. 2339 of "Curtis's Botanical Magazine"
Following the formal description, he wrote as follows:"Burchellia bubalina" is a native of the Cape of Good Hope, where it is called Buffelhorn or Buffaloe-Horn, a name given it by the colonists from the extreme hardness of its wood. Flowers in the spring or summer. Requires to be protected from frost and we believe has seldom blossomed in this country without the assistance of the heat of the stove. Communicated by Messrs. Loddiges and Sons.
The name of the genus was given in honour of William John Burchell, an African explorer.

DB Museum, Koblenz

The DB Museum in Koblenz was opened on 21 April 2001 as the first remote site of the Nuremberg Transport Museum. It is run by volunteer workers as part of the "Stiftung Bahn-Sozialwerk" (BSW), a kind of railway workers social service organisation, and has its origins in a BSW's 'Group for the Preservation of Historical Railway Vehicles' at Koblenz.
Emergence.
The DB Museum, Koblenz, is housed in the former goods wagon repair shop ("Ausbesserungswerk") in the Koblenz district of Lützel. The site was built in 1905 as part of the rebuilding and expansion of Lützel goods station into the Koblenz-Lützel locomotive depot ("Bahnbetriebswerk").
Originally the facility included a large roundhouse with two turntables, where the goods locomotives were stabled, as well as a wagon shed in which goods wagons were repaired until 1995. Today it accommodates the vehicles belonging to the DB Museum at Koblenz. The old "Bahnbetriebswerk" was dismantled bit by bit up to the early 1980s.
Exhibits.
Various exhibits are displayed on the open part of the site. The museum's collection of vehicles includes more than 20 locomotives and wagons. The central themes of the exhibitions are electric trains and travelling by rail. In addition to the exhibits of actual vehicles, these themes are expanded by means of photographs, pictures and models in the museum rooms.
Other facilities.
Books, model railway items and other gifts with a railway theme may be found in the small shop at the entrance.
A model railway, built in modular ("Nordmodul") fashion, recalls the atmosphere of the steam age in the post-war years. Outside in the open air, a 110 m² LGB garden railway layout is being constructed.

Simon Archer (antiquary)

Sir Simon Archer (21 September 1581–before 4 June 1662) was an English antiquary and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1640.
Archer was the eldest son of Andrew Archer (died 1629) of Umberslade Hall, near Tanworth in Arden, Warwickshire. Like his father, he expanded the family estate. He was knighted on 21 August 1624 at Warwick Castle.
In 1628 Archer was appointed High Sheriff of Warwickshire and, in April 1640, elected as Member of Parliament for Tamworth in the Short Parliament. He remained neutral in the English Civil War in 1642, but two of his sons fought on the Parliamentary side. From 1644 he himself served on the parliamentarian subcommittee for accounts in Warwickshire, which served as a curb on the more militant members of the county committee. In the 1650s, he was active as a Justice of the Peace in local government, and (unusually) retained this office after the Restoration, until his death. 
His main claim to fame was as an antiquary, starting work on the history of his native county in the 1630s. William Dugdale was initially his assistant, but when Archer became more involved in public affairs, Dugdale took over the lead, resulting in the publication in 1656 of Dugdale's "Antiquities of Warwickshire", with a fulsome acknowledgement to Archer's work in the epistle dedicatory. 
He married Anne, daughter of Sir John Ferrers of Tamworth Castle. He was succeeded at Umberslade Hall by his second son Thomas. His great grandson, another Thomas was created Baron Archer in 1747.

Led by Scotland's Mark Morrison and managed by Johnny Hammond the tour took in 22 matches. Of the games three were test matches, played against the South Africa national rugby union team. The British Isles drew the first two test matches and lost the final encounter.
Having lost only one game out of 40 matches in the previous two tours of South Africa, the British Isles team were truly tested by the South African rugby nation on this tour. Of the 22 games played, the tourist won eleven, drew three and lost eight. Unlike past teams, the British Isles three-quarter line was not seen as the team's strongest asset and more reliance was placed in the pack. Of the backs, only Reg Skrimshire, the only Welsh player selected, was judged to have shown any true flair; while the pack failed to live up to expectations, even when led by Scottish power-house David Bedell-Sivright.
The tour included Louis Leisler Greig, who later became well known as a royal equerry, friend of George VI and became a prominent member of the far right January Club.

Prologue (Prose Edda)

The Prologue is the first section of four books of the "Prose Edda", and consists of a euhemerized account of the origins of Norse mythology: the Norse gods are described descended from the Trojans.
The genealogy presented by Snorri begins with Priam.
Priam's daughter Tróán married king Múnón or Mennón. Their son was Trór, or Thor, who was fostered in Thrace.
Thor slew his foster father and married Sibil, identified with Sif. 
The line of descendants of Thor and Sif is given as follows:
Finally, the son of Fríallaf was "Vóden, whom we call Odin", who came to Germany ("Saxland") and established the royal lines there.
In Saxland, Odin's sons Vegdeg, Beldeg (Baldr) and Sigi founded the ruling houses of the Franks, from whom descended the Völsungs.
Odin himself moved on to Jutland (Reidgothland), where he established his son Skjöldr, from whom derive the Skjöldungs, the kings of the Danes.
After this, Odin went on to Sweden, where there was a king named Gylfi. Gylfi welcomed Odin and his train as "men of Asia, who were called Æsir".
In Sweden, Odin founded a city called Sigtún as a Trojan colony. Later, Odin's son Yngvi became king of Sweden, founding the Yngling dynasty.
Finally, Odin went on to Norway, where he established his son Sæmingr as king.
The "Prologue" concludes in a linguistic remark, observing that the Æsir when they came to the north intermarried with local women and gradually lost their "Asian" language, adopting the local tongue, but that the names of the earliest members of their lineages remain in their original "Asian" language.
Snorri's genealogy is obviously informed by Anglo-Saxon tradition, as preserved by Æthelweard and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. His genealogy from Seskef to Odin directly parallels that from Sceaf to Woden in Anglo-Saxon tradition, and Snorri explicitly gives Odin's original name as "Vóden", explaining that the original names of the Æsir were better preserved in England. Snorri's Skjaldun, intermediate between Seskef and Odin, corresponds to the Anglo-Saxon Scyld, but Snorri sees himself forced to duplicate this character as Skjöldr, son of Odin, as the eponymous ancestor of the Skjöldungs.
Regarding the euhemerization in the "Prologue", Faulkes (1985) commented that "undoubtedly one of the motives for including the prologue, and maybe the chief reason for the use of the frame device itself, was to avoid the criticism that his stories were dangerous to orthodoxy".

Neopaganism in Hungary

Neopaganism in Hungary (Hungarian: "Újpogányság") is very diverse, with followers of the Hungarian native faith and of other religions, including Wiccans, Kemetics, Mithraics, Druids and Christopagans.
Szilárdi (2006) describes the movement as a postmodern combination of ethnocentric linguistic, national, religious and occasional political patterns of identity. Interest in the reconstruction of an ethnic religion for the Hungarians manifested for the first time in the early 20th century. A contribution to the popularisation of Pagan ideas in the Hungarian society was the tremendous success of the rock opera "István, a király" in 1984.
Religions.
Christopaganism.
Many Pagan groups in Hungary make use of Christian terminology and iconography re-interpreted in an ethnic Pagan way. This is the case of the "Church of Esoteric Beliefs — Church of the Holy Crown" (Hungarian: "Ezoterikus Tanok Egyháza — Szent Korona Egyház"), conceptualising a Scythian ancient religion with Christian character, worshiping the "Fény Jézus" ("Light Jesus") and the "Boldogasszony" ("Blessed Lady"), with the "táltos" as priests. The church has been establishing "naptemplomok" (singular: "naptemplom"), "temples of the Sun", as its places of worship. Another organisation of this kind is the "Our Lady's Love Church" ("Nagyboldogasszony Szeretet Egyház").
Hungarian Neopaganism.
Hungarian Neopaganism, the Hungarian native faith, or "Ősmagyar Vallás" (meaning "Ancient Hungarian Religion" or more accurately "Arch-Hungarian Religion") as it is called in the local Neopagan discourse, defines the movements which seek to rebuild a purely Hungarian ethnic religion, inspired to Hungarian mythology and folklore. This drift has roots in the ethnological studies of the early 20th century, while the elaboration of a national Hungarian religion was endorsed in the interwar Turanist circles (1930s-40s), finally blossoming alongside other Pagan religions since the fall of the Soviet Union. The difference between Hungarian Neopagan groups is often determined by their differing ideas about the historical origins of the Hungarians.
The development of the Hungarian Neopagan movements largely rely on the work of individual shamans or neoshamans, the "táltos", who may organise themselves in associations, set up schools, or establish larger religious organisations. The shamans' movement started to come to light in the 1980s, organising cooperation with representatives of core shamanism from the United States since 1986. Those "táltos" who espouse a Turanist ideology often choose to affiliate with Tengrism.
The most important organisations of this kind are the "Yotengrit", and the "Ősmagyar Táltos Egyház" ("Arch-Hungarian Táltos Church") founded by András Kovács-Magyar, who later also founded the "Táltos Iskola" ("Táltos School"). Other groups of this stream are the "Ősmagyar Egyház" ("Arch-Hungarian Church") and the "Magyar Vallás Közössége" ("Community of Hungarian Religion").
Another church of the Hungarian native faith is the "Árpád Rendjének Jogalapja Tradicionális Egyház" ("Traditional Church of the Order of Árpád"), founded in 2009. It is ispired to the Traditionalist School, the Nouvelle Droite of Alain de Benoist, and to the concept of a common Indo-European paganism.
Kemetism.
The "Ankh — Church of Eternal Life" (Hungarian: "Ankh — Az Örök Élet Egyháza") is a Kemetic church in Hungary, founded in 1999. They propose a theory that sees God as the source of the universe, himself being the universe, inclosing every conscious and unconscious being. The aim of the organisation is to cultivate and meet the gods, who are the powers acting in the creation.
Neo-Mithraism.
The "Sodalitas Mithraica" (Latin for "Mithraic Fellowship") is a Neo-Mithraic group active in Hungary.
Wicca and Witchcraft.
"Magyar Boszorkányszövetség" (meaning "Hungarian Witchcraft") is a Budapest-based Neopagan organization formed in 1986. Wicca, a religion of English origin, has spread to Hungary as in the other countries of Western Europe. Zsuzsanna Budapest, a Hungarian who emigrated to the United States, is the founder of the Wiccan denomination known as Dianic Wicca, popular in North America. The Celtic Wiccan Tradition Church ("Kelta-Wicca Hagyományőrzők Egyháza") is a Celtic Wiccan church in Hungary.

Write out

A write out is a punishment used in schools in which a misbehaving student must write something out. It is different from writing lines as, instead of writing something out a number of times, the student might write out a page, chapter or paragraph of their schoolbook, workbook or novel. In the case of non-written homework (spellings), the student might have to write the spellings a number of times.

Hungarian neopaganism

Hungarian Neopaganism, the Hungarian Native Faith, or Ősmagyar Vallás (Hungarian expression meaning Ancient Hungarian Religion, or more accurately Arch-Hungarian Religion) as it is called in the local discourse, is a broad category defining the Neopagan movements which seek to rebuild an ethnic religion of the Hungarians, inspired to Hungarian mythology and folklore. These movements have roots in the ethnological studies of the early 20th century, later the elaboration of a national Hungarian religion was endorsed in the interwar Turanist circles (1930s-40s), and finally blossomed alongside other Pagan religions in Hungary since the fall of the Soviet Union.
The boundaries between Hungarian Neopagan groups are often determined by their differing ideas about the ethnogenetic origins of the Hungarians, which have historically been a matter of debate. Many groups acknowledge the mainstream Uralic theory of the Hungarian origins, while other ones disallow it, endorsing Scythian, Sumerian or Turkic connections.
The development of the Hungarian Neopagan movements largely rely on a background layer constituted by the work of individual shamans or neoshamans, the "táltos", who have surfaced since the 1980s. Some of the "Ősmagyar Vallás" organisations find support from the Fidesz and Jobbik political formations.
History.
The study of the ancient religion of the Hungarian people has been hanging together with the debate on their ethnogenesis. Fringe theories about Scythian and Sumerian origins were supported by early ethnologists. With the mid-19th century Romantic influence on ethnology, new studies on folklore were carried out, and the mainstream religious studies circles gradually welcomed the conception of the original Hungarian religion as based on shamanism, with relations to Uralic and Siberian traditions. This stream of thought was hallmarked by Arnold Ipolyi's impressive "Hungarian Mythology".
The idea of an ethnic Hungarian shamanism was later carried forward in a psychoanalytical way by Géza Róheim in the 1920s, and by Vilmos Diószegi with field work in Siberia in the 1950s and the 1960s. The shamanic character of the original Hungarian religion, whether the native faith is fully described by it or it was only an aspect, is accepted by the majority of scholars. Thus, further studies focussed on the ethnic Hungarian shamans, the "táltos". The idea of a national Hungarian religion was later endorsed also in the Hungarian Turanist milieu in the 1930s and the 1940s, generally focussing on a kinship with both the Uralic peoples and the Turkic peoples.
The "táltos" background.
Hungarian chronicles of the 13th century still make reference to "magicians" as "táltos" (shaman) persons. The "táltos" tradition survived until the World War II in rural areas, where certain people were still considered as "táltos" by the local community, though they practiced weather-magic only.
Diószegi describes the "táltos" as specialists who are able to get controlled ecstasy ("rejtezés"). The position of the "táltos" is reached by heredity or vocation; the process includes typical stages: after initial resistance to vocation and the various symptoms of the "shamanic disease", the chosen by the gods finally accepts his role. The "táltos" gets shamanic knowledges at a young age, through shamanic journeys in days-long dreams, in which the main initiation goal is climbing the "égig érő fa" ("sky-high tree"), also called "életfa" ("tree of life"), "világfa" ("world tree") or "tetejetlen fa" ("tree without a top"). Diószegi considered many elements of the Hungarian shamanic tradition to be Hungarian ethnic specificities, not found in Central Asian traditions.
Currently, the Hungarian ethnology of religion, primarily the academic circle of Miháli Hoppál, has an important role in international shamanic studies. The ethnological accounts define the "táltos", and generically the shaman, as that whose social functions are to heal, prophesy, and save the cultural traditions connecting the past and the present, the individual and the community, men and nature and the gods. In the words of Hoppál shamanism is depicted as a "bridge and symbol, because it interconnects the traditions of the past with the present, and anchors the future of traditions".
The shamans' movement started to come to light in the 1980s, organising cooperation with Michael Harner and other representatives of core shamanism from the United States since 1986. Miháli Hoppál strongly supports the neoshamanic revival in his country as a mean of ethnic revival, reproduction of ethnic identity, and he significantly contributed to the development of the local Hungarian Native Faith scene.
There are significant differences between American and Hungarian neoshamanisms. Whilst the American movement provides a trans-cultural technique, designed as adaptable to different cultural contexts, and focussed on self-empowerment and healing application, the Hungarian neoshamanic movement is intrinsically an ethnic religious phenomenon.
"Táltos" congregations hold weekly ritual gatherings; in addition, they organise collective pilgrimages and healing occasions. The participants celebrate toghether different rituals (rituals of inituation, rituals of passage, sweat lodges and fire-walk ceremonies, fertility, healing and purifying rites, either for the environment, the participants, the collectivity or the nation), perform shamanic drumming, and techniques of meditation and self-development. While the ceremonies are usually led by the "táltos", the community actively takes part. The most well-known contemporary "táltos" are Zoltán Sólyomfi, István Somogyi, Fehérholló Öskü, and András Kovács-Magyar.
Organised forms.
The heterogeneity of Hungarian native faith churches shows the diversity of the views within the movement. Besides religious concepts, they differ from each other in the character of their activities. They are often gradual developments of "táltos" communities, or are established by individual "táltos"; these charismatic figures are considered by their followers valid spiritual leaders and while some act only in their local communities, others have national reputation. Their recognition and legitimacy is based on attributed healing and spiritual power, ritual efficiency and authenticity. The most influential organisations of this kind are the "Yotengrit", and the "Ősmagyar Táltos Egyház" ("Ancient Hungarian Táltos Church" or "Arch-Hungarian Táltos Church").
Ősmagyar Táltos Church.
The Ancient Hungarian Táltos Church or Arch-Hungarian Táltos Church(Hungarian: "Ősmagyar Táltos Egyház") was founded by András Kovács-Magyar, who later also founded the Noetic Táltos School (Hungarian: "Szellemi Táltos Iskola"). András Kovács-Magyar is a very popular shaman, and his religious enterprise is flourishing. The church promulgates the sacredness of the Pilis Mountains.
Traditional Church of the Order of Árpád.
The Traditional Church of the Order of Árpád (Hungarian: "Árpád Rendjének Jogalapja Tradicionális Egyház") is a distinct group within the Hungarian native faith. It was founded in 2009 and makes reference to the Turanist emigrated ideologues Adorján Magyar and Victor Padányi, but it is ispired to the Traditionalist School, the Nouvelle Droite of Alain de Benoist, and to the concept of a common Indo-European paganism. The church's name is a reference to the Árpád dynasty.
Yotengrit.
In recent years, "Yotengrit" became one of the most influential Hungarian native faith movements. Whilst this ethnic religion is considered by adherents as a faithful heir of the pre-Christian belief system, it could be defined as reconstructionist with various non-indigenous influences. The founder and leader of the movement is Imre Máté, who took part to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, later emigrating to Germany where he became a businessman and poet. In the 1990s he was back to Hungary and founded the "Yotengrit" in his region of origin, proclaiming himself a "táltos".
The movement, based on Máté's ideas, proposes a dualistic theology: a masculine sky god named "Gönüz", from a Turkic word for "Sun"; and a female mother goddess, "Ukkó", identified with the "Boldogasszony" of the folk beliefs. The movement does not refuse completely the Finno-Ugric legacy of the Hungarians; religious tolerance and political neutrality are emphasised by the movement.
Others.
Other groups of this stream are the Ancient Hungarian Church or Arch-Hungarian Church (Hungarian: "Ősmagyar Egyház") and the Community of Hungarian Religion (Hungarian: "Magyar Vallás Közössége"). They are either connected to Turanist ideologues, and post-Turanist ones. Their common reference points are Badinji-Jós and Ida Bobula.
"Ősmagyar Vallás" and Tengrism.
Those "táltos" who espouse a Turanist ideology ("id est" the theory of the Hungarian kinship with the Turkic peoples) sometimes choose to affiliate with Tengrism, that is the Turkic ethnic religion. This is the case of Zoltán Sólyomfi, a renowned "táltos" in Hungary. These "táltos" are generally characterised by their used of the Turkic name of the Deity, "Tengri", instead of the Hungarian indigenous one, which is "Isten".
In 2012 a nine meters high "életfa" (tree of life) was gift by Hungarian Neopagans to the Tengrists of Kazakhstan. In the same year, Ojun Adigzsi See-Oglu, a famous shaman from Tuva, was invited to the Hungarian Parliament Building and performed a ritual dance around the Holy Crown of Hungary.

Durrës Amphitheatre

The Durrës Amphitheatre () is a large Roman amphitheatre in the city of Durrës, Albania. Built in the 2nd century AD during Roman Emperor Trajan's rule, it is located in the centre of the city and is only half unearthed. The Durrës Amphitheatre is one of the largest amphitheatres in the Balkan peninsula, once having a capacity of 20,000 people, and has no analogs in Albania. It was discovered in the late 1900s and today has become a popular tourist attraction. Durrës Amphitheatre is a World Heritage candidate.
History.
The amphitheatre was built in the 2nd century AD. The city of Durrës was first mentioned in 627 BC. The amphitheatre was used for performances until the 5th century AD, well after the Byzantine Empire, where it was located, adopted Christianity as the state religion. In the 6th century, the chapel devoted to Saint Asti, the first bishop of Durrës and a martyr, was built on the amphitheatre. It was laid out with mosaics.
About one third of the site was discovered and excavated in the 1900s, and the rest was excavated in the 1960s. There was no conservation efforts undertaken by the authorities before the 2000s, and the amphitheatre was slowly decaying. In addition, there was construction undertaken around the site. In the 2004 the University of Parma started restoration work to save the monument.
Site.
The amphitheatre has an elliptical shape with the axes of and . The arena is by and is high. It is built on a slope of the hill, and inside the amphitheatre there are staircases and galleries at different levels. The chapel with mosaics is preserved.
The site currently functions as a museum.
Dangers.
The amphitheatre is surrounded on all sides by the city of Durrës, and a section of the arena itself has been built upon with modern housing. Thus, development pressures threaten the long-term preservation of the site. The municipality of Durrës is now planning to remove the houses.
There are structural deficiencies, and mosaics and paintings are slowly decaying.
In 2013, the amphiteatre was shortlisted along with thirteen other sites by Europa Nostra as one of the most endangered cultural heritage sites in Europe.

Lena Kundera and Bianca Montgomery

Lena Kundera and Bianca Montgomery are fictional characters from the American daytime drama "All My Children". Commonly referred to by the portmanteau "Lianca" (for Lena and Bianca), they were the first lesbian couple on an American soap opera. Lena was portrayed by Olga Sosnovska, and Bianca was portrayed by Eden Riegel. Lena and Bianca's romance "quickly became a hit with viewers" and regularly surpassed older more established heterosexual couples for the #1 spot on Internet and soap opera magazine readers' polls. The characters are the first to share a same-sex kiss in American soap opera history.
Background.
Writing and portrayals.
The writers characterized resident lesbian and good girl Bianca Montgomery's romantic life as tortured; she consistently fell for heterosexual or unavailable women. When the series showcased her having fallen in love with best friend and confidante Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson), this theme was continued. Maggie declared herself heterosexual and told Bianca she was only romantically interested in men. To show Bianca moving on, and to add conflict to Bianca and Maggie's relationship, the writers introduced Lena Kundera in December 2002. Lena, a "sassy" bisexual from Poland, was characterized as a temptress "in the mold of Juliette Binoche". Bianca instantly found Lena attractive and competed for her attention with friend Boyd Larraby (Marc Menard), as they bet on which one of them could date Lena first. Viewers watched as Lena began spending time with Bianca as part of an "evil plan" to take over Bianca's mother's company, but also as she found herself falling in love with Bianca. In an interview reported by the "New York Post", Brian Frons, head of ABC Daytime, stated that he considered the Lena and Bianca pairing "much bolder" than romantically pairing Bianca with "longtime" galpal Maggie. 
Bianca was 19 and Lena was in her late 20s, around the same age as Boyd. The writers had Bianca win the bet against Boyd, and Lena and Bianca bond easier despite their age difference. Boyd was suspicious of Lena's intentions, and persuaded mother-figure Myrtle Fargate (Eileen Herlie) to chaperone the couple. Though Myrtle saw nothing to convince her of malice on Lena's part, Boyd's suspicions were valid. "Lena has made a lot of mistakes in her past," clarified Eden Riegel, Bianca's portrayer. "She has not proven herself a very nice person. Of course, Bianca doesn't know that. And now Lena is working with Michael (a bad guy played by William deVry) to try to take down Enchantment." Michael Cambias, portrayed by actor William deVry, was scripted as Lena's business partner and lover. As part of a secret plot to destroy Bianca's mother, Erica Kane, and her cosmetics company (Enchantment), Lena was told by Michael to get close to Bianca so Bianca could be more easily manipulated. 
The writers showcased Lena's guilt regarding the takeover plan after she developed romantic feelings for Bianca. She refused to continue the manipulation, but was blackmailed by Michael into following through with the takeover. Lena eventually decided to leave town rather than betray Bianca and tell her the truth. She informed Bianca that she could never see her again. "For Bianca, this was a huge disappointment," said Riegel. "Every time she opens up to a woman, she gets her heart broken." 
To reunite the couple in dramatic fashion, the show had Myrtle urge Bianca to follow Lena to the airport and demand an explanation; on the April 23, 2003 episode, the two characters shared the first same-sex kiss in American soap opera history. "It's that kind of old romantic airport scene in which the two lovers decide whether they can take the risk and take a chance on love -- only it's two women this time," relayed Riegel. Riegel had never kissed a woman before. "I was a little nervous because I wanted it to look natural and organic and real and true," she said. "I didn't want it to seem tentative." Riegel and Olga Sosnovska discussed practicing the kiss. "We thought about maybe trying it out in the dressing room first," Riegel laughed. "But then we just thought, 'We are professionals. This will be fine." The writers detailed "fun and daring" moves in the episode, such as having Bianca discuss with Myrtle her confusion about Lena leaving her. Myrtle, in her aristocratic British accent, replied, "Maybe it was too hot!" Giving insight into Bianca's unlucky romantic life, she suggested that Bianca loves unavailable women because her mother is always running away from true love.
The physical aspects of Lena and Bianca's romance were heavily downplayed by the series. When asked if she thought she and Riegel had succeeded in living up to the "couple's groundbreaking and progressive" reputation, Sosnovska responded, "Yes, we succeeded to a certain extent. We succeeded in making this couple acceptable." After a pause, Sosnovska continued, "Not acceptable in a realistic sense, since our relationship hasn’t been portrayed truly realistically, which would have been nice." She described Bianca and Lena's physical relationship as "kind of ostentatiously reserved" compared to what gets shown between heterosexual couples, "although I’m quite shocked by what does get shown between the heterosexual couples." Even though the couple had recently started "dating" again, as the writers also scripted a love triangle including Maggie, there was an apparent double-standard regarding intimacy between the same sex lovers; in the entire year of Lena and Bianca's on-again, off-again relationship, the two women had only kissed twice onscreen. The final obstacles given to the couple's onscreen intimacy were Bianca's rape by Michael and pregnancy with his child, which were controversial and seen by viewers as desperate attempts by the network to avoid lesbian love scenes. AfterEllen.com editor Sarah Warn stated that it was a way to assure Bianca's continued asexuality. Warn added that "the pregnant-lesbian storyline" is a favorite refuge for television writers who both want to avoid dealing with the sexual aspects of lesbian relationships and who want to "normalize" the lesbian characters — "to show viewers that, at their core, lesbians are just like heterosexual women — who of course, all want to be mothers". In 2004, though Lena and Bianca were allowed to kiss for a third time onscreen, it came at the end of their romance, as Lena went back to Poland to tend to her ailing mother and the couple was later written to have broken up over the phone.
Reception and impact.
2003 kiss.
"All My Children" made television history on April 23, 2003 when Lena and Bianca shared the first same-sex kiss in American soap opera history. The kiss was not the first same-sex kiss for daytime television. The United Kingdom had featured its first lesbian kiss between fictional characters on the soap opera "Brookside" ten years earlier in December 1993, portrayed by actresses Anna Friel and Nicola Stephenson. Lena and Bianca sharing a kiss, however, and also being between two people of the same sex, was something that had been thought of as unlikely for American soap opera. The kiss received media attention such as "TV Guide", "Soap Opera Digest", and other publications. On the day before the kiss aired, Riegel and Sosnovska appeared on the morning talk show "The View" and answered questions from Barbara Walters and the other hosts, including guest host Monica Lewinsky. Star Jones introduced the segment by stating that "All My Children" had dealt with a number of controversial topics, including "AIDS, abortion, drug abuse, racial prejudice, and teenage alcoholism, but no storyline has generated the kind of buzz as the lesbian kiss". The kiss was shown to the audience and followed up with questions by the hosts consisting of whether the actresses were nervous acting out the intimate scenes and what it was like to portray lesbians. 
Critics were mixed on how the Lena and Bianca kiss was portrayed, on whether it was as realistic as it should be. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com stated, "Not the most passionate kiss, but satisfying enough, given that most of the episode was devoted to showcasing the big event." The kiss represented a change in American culture. Stephen Tropiano of PopMatters said, "In perhaps what could be a step in the right direction, daytime television has at last included the first on-screen kiss between a same-sex couple." Tropiano, however, criticized shows treating same-sex kisses as "big events". He stated, "Over the years, television has repeatedly made the same point by treating a kiss exchanged between two members of the same sex as something out-of-the-ordinary and unnatural. It's the network brass more than television series writers and producers who have reinforced society's negative attitudes toward public displays of affection between gay and lesbian couples by treating same-sex kissing as a taboo subject." Tropiano wondered now that Lena and Bianca had kissed if they would kiss again or go beyond that in regards to physical intimacy; he felt that it was not likely until society, or at least, television, began to regard a same-sex kiss as just a kiss. 
When asked if soap opera fans were ready for the kiss, Riegel stated, "I know that on the (Internet) message boards, there is a small but vocal minority that didn't want to see this. But the vast majority (of fans) were ready, excited and with the storyline." For "All My Children" fans, who had witnessed Bianca's unlucky romantic life, the kiss "was long overdue". 
Popularity.
Though the couple was popular, they were also controversial. Sosnovska was asked if she realized that by accepting this role she would be stepping into "so much" controversy. "I’m still coming to terms with this phenomenon of Lianca," she replied, "with the devotion that I’m shown as a couple on TV, and the whole concept of fans. The letters that I get are heart breaking. It’s horrible that even now in the 21st century many lesbians feel the need to hide. Not everyone is confident enough to face the world, and not everyone lives in a safe environment." She continued, "I never really thought about it before--it doesn’t occur to you that this medieval type of mentality occurs. It’s horrifying what happens." Sosnovska did, however, see the decision to be out as a personal choice. "I don’t blame people who choose not be out," she said. She donated her time to fan sponsored fundraisers that raised money for several charities connected to the Lena and Bianca storylines. Over $20,000 had been raised for the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project. Sosnovska stated, "I would never have known what a powerful tool TV could be, especially daytime. It’s frightening to the extent it’s a huge responsibility on the producers, directors, and actors to influence minds. You can’t underestimate the force of it." 
Sosnovska was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from fans. "I apologize to anybody who’s sent me anything and hasn’t gotten a reply. I physically can’t keep up with it (the volume of mail), especially when I go away," she said in emphasis of a recent trip to London she had made. In addition to helping with fundraisers, Sosnovska was outspoken about gay marriage. "I've been listening to the debate about gay marriage, she said. "It’s very difficult to wrap my head around people who oppose such a basic right. There’s no logic behind any of these reasons gay marriage. opposed to it have no idea about the fact that they’re talking about normal people." In this respect, Sosnovska hoped her role as Lena had helped, if even a little, since "the more human faces you can put to this story, the better". 
AfterEllen.com cites that lesbian and bisexual women do not have "many characters" they can call their own, and had never had a daytime couple that they "could pin hopes and dreams on". Sosnovska and Riegel together as Lena and Bianca "became that couple" and the audience was given "the chance to see two sexy, confident, and very out women together as daytime television's first lesbian couple". Though prime time dramas such as "The L Word" feature more lesbian and bisexual content, it is only available on cable. "All My Children"'s advantage is that it is seen " in homes across the country that might not intentionally tune into shows with lesbian characters". The fact that a significant portion of viewers grew up with some of these characters enabled the series to develop "a certain comfort level" with the audience that other television characters do not have. 
AfterEllen.com theorized that what endeared the Lena and Bianca romance to "so many viewers across the country" and allowed them to create a significant contribution to the acceptance of lesbians and bisexual women onscreen and in society was chemistry This chemistry, the website reasoned, made the pairing a fan favorite. The website stated that "one of the main reasons that viewers both gay and straight" thoroughly liked this pairing "was the amazingly realistic portrayal of two people in love who just happen to be women". 
"They are both sensational actresses who, though heterosexual, committed wholly to the relationship," said Mimi Torchin, former founding editor-in-chief of "Soap Opera Weekly" and then columnist for the magazine along with soap opera website SOAPnet.com. "You weren't aware so much that history was being made but rather that this was something beautiful and special that you had never seen before," she stated. "There was a purity to their love that made it non-threatening to the straight audience." 
Lena and Bianca's romance was a classic soap opera story of love and redemption--the bad girl saved by the love of an innocent. They became one of the show's most successful romances. "and Bianca were the No. 1 couple in daytime," said Riegel. "They embraced Bianca with a fervor usually reserved for only the hunkiest of heroes. That experience taught me to never underestimate the open-mindedness of daytime audiences."

Gay City News is a free weekly newspaper based in New York City that focuses on local and national issues relating to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. It was founded in 1994 as "Lesbian Gay New York", later "LGNY", and was sold to Community Media LLC, owner of "The Villager", in 2002, which renamed the publication. It is the largest LGBT newspaper in the United States, with a circulation of 47,000.
"Gay City News" came into existence after several incarnations. The newspaper began to form in the late 1980s after the collapse of the LGBT newsmagazine "OUTWEEK" (which came into existence in 1985 to compete against the then-dominant "New York Native"—which itself folded in 1997). "OUTWEEK" was famous for firebrand activist style journalism and provided groundbreaking coverage of a then nascent gay civil rights movement. It was one of the first publications to undertake scientific reporting on the growing AIDS crisis.
After an investor squabble that closed the magazine, Troy Masters, then an advertising director at "OUTWEEK", led the formation of a group to create a new publication; that publication became known as "QW", the first glossy gay magazine, and was funded by William F. Chafin. Mr. Chafin died before the publication could make a profit, and the magazine was closed upon his death.
Two years later, Masters sought to establish a newspaper and founded "LGNY". "LGNY" published for 8 years and was relaunched in 2002 as "Gay City News". 
Its current editor-in-chief is Paul Schindler, and the associate editor is Duncan Osborne.

County of Hawke (New Zealand electorate)

County of Hawke was a 19th-century parliamentary electorate in what is now the Hawke's Bay region of New Zealand in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament in 1860.
History.
In 1858 the General Assembly made some significant changes to electoral boundaries and increased parliamentary representation from 37 members to 41. One of the changes meant the electorate was split into its two separate components (with both and County of Hawke expanding inland into previously unincorporated areas). County of Hawke was represented by two Members of Parliament, James Ferguson, incumbent in the seat as member for the previous Wairarapa and Hawke's Bay electorate and Thomas FitzGerald from 26 April to 5 November in 1860 after winning the .
The second Parliament was dissolved on 5 November, and FitzGerald did not seek election to the new Parliament. He had been elected Superintendent of the new Hawke's Bay Province in 1859. He moved to Queensland, Australia in 1862.
In 1861, the new Napier seat was formed in Hawke's Bay.

Apple Trek

Apple Trek is a computer game for the Apple II family of computers based on the "" science fiction series.
Summary.
This is similar to the earlier mainframe-based "Star Trek" game. It runs in text mode and was written in Integer BASIC.
The object of the game is to defeat all the Klingons (called "Klarnons" in some versions) on the board. Resources may be replenished at starbases.
A depiction of the known quadrants is at the top of the text screen, with three-digit numbers indicating the number of Klingons, the number of starbases and the number of stars respectively. Navigating to a different quadrant reveals the adjacent quadrants. A depiction of the quadrant in which the Enterprise is present is in the lower left.
Absolute position is given as ordered pairs: vertical, from the top; and horizontal, from the left. Angle notation is navigation style: 0 degrees at the top, counting clockwise.
Two unusual features the game had, for text-based Star Trek games, were that when torpedoes were fired the player would see them travel, and also that the Klingons had torpedoes (in these early games, they were usually armed only with disruptors).

Gérald Baticle

Gérald Baticle (born 10 October 1969 in Amiens), is a former French football player and manager.
Playing career.
Baticle started his pro-career in his native Picardy region at Amiens SC but quickly attracted the attention of Guy Roux who recruited him at AJ Auxerre. He played his first game in Ligue 1 on September 19, 1991 against FC Metz. In 1992/93, he was the UEFA Cup's top goalscorer as Auxerre reached the semi-finals where they were edged out by Borussia Dortmund after a penalty shootout. A year later, Baticle scored one of Auxerre's goal during the final of the French cup where the AJA defeated Montpellier HSC 3:0 to win its first national title. In 1994/95, Baticle had to face the concurrence of an emerging Lilian Laslandes for the sole striker post in Guy Roux's emblematic 4-3-3. He then chose to move to an ambitious RC Strasbourg side where he joined a team composed of Frank Leboeuf, Franck Sauzée and Aleksandr Mostovoi. Baticle spent three seasons at Strasbourg and was a captain there after Leboeuf's departure in 1996. He was repositioned as an offensive midfielder by Jacky Duguépéroux and, in this position, was instrumental in Strasbourg's 1997 League cup triumph as well as the good UEFA Cup run the following season. He was then back for a season and a half at Auxerre as a transition striker between world champion Stéphane Guivarc'h and the young Djibril Cissé. In December 1999, he was transferred to FC Metz where he enjoyed decent success as a striker for three years in a struggling team. When Metz was relegated, Baticle moved to Troyes AC for a season before ending his career in 2003/4 with Ligue 2 side Le Havre AC.
Coaching career.
Baticle was a successful youth coach for three seasons with AJ Auxerre's under 18 team, reaching the final of the Coupe Gambardella in 2007. In October 2008, Pascal Janin was sacked from his post at Stade Brestois and it was rumoured that general manager Corentin Martins was eager to bring his former Auxerre teammate at Brest for the managing job but the move was at first opposed by Auxerre's president Jean-Claude Hamel. Ultimately, a compromise was found and Baticle joined Brest, winning his first game 4:0 against SC Bastia on November 7, 2008. He was fired on May 2009 and replaced by Alex Dupont.

First Direct Arena

The First Direct Arena (formerly known as the Leeds Arena) is a 13,500 capacity entertainment focused arena in Leeds, West Yorkshire. It is the first in the United Kingdom to have a fan-shaped orientation.
The arena officially opened its doors on 4 September 2013 with Sir Elton John, playing to an audience of 12,000. Bruce Springsteen had, however, held the first concert on 24 July 2013, with an audience of 13,000. The arena's opening season in 2013 later included acts including Kaiser Chiefs and Rod Stewart.
History.
Public demand for an arena in Leeds.
Leeds has been the largest city in the United Kingdom without a major venue to hold music or indoor sporting events. , Bristol and Leeds were the only major cities without an arena style venue. Previously, the Queen's Hall was used for popular music concerts but this was demolished in 1989. Since 1989, there have been a number of failed attempts at building a major venue in Leeds.
An arena has been long requested by residents in Leeds. The consultation on the Vision for Leeds 2004 to 2020 showed a strong demand from the public for a new arena, and the project became one of the city's 12 priorities. The Leeds Initiative formed a Cultural facilities task group to consider options. It appointed PMP consultants whose report outlined the viability of a Leeds Arena,and other potential projects such as a concert hall. The task group recommended that the Council proceed with the development of a 12,500 seat arena.
Whilst this study was taking place, campaigners including the "Yorkshire Evening Post" lobbied for a new arena to be built in the city. This resulted in a widescale 'Leeds needs an arena' campaign that had endorsements from local artists including the Kaiser Chiefs as well as local businesses and residents. The campaign was well publicised in local media, and included popular Myspace and Facebook groups.
Developer and operator competition.
Following this, competitions began to find an operator and developer for an arena. In March 2008, SMG were chosen as the future operators of the First Direct Arena, following world wide interest from potential operators in the scheme. SMG also operate arenas in Newcastle, Belfast and Manchester and operate over 200 venues worldwide. The addition of Leeds strengthens their position in the UK Arena market. SMG's European managing director has stated that Leeds will be its "flagship venue" in Europe and that they expect First Direct Arena "to be in the top 10 in the world within two to three years of opening".
Two main bidders were involved in the competition to develop the arena. These were the Council owned land at Elland Road as one location which would have been developed by GMI and land owned by Montpellier Estates in Sweet Street, Holbeck with Montpellier Estates being developer of the latter site. However in November 2008, Leeds City Council announced they had terminated the developer competition and chosen Claypit Lane as the site for the new arena and would proceed as the developer. This resulted in a legal challenge from Montpellier Estates. Montpellier's claim for more than £43.5m was rejected by Justice Supperstone in a Judgement handed down on 6 February 2013.
Plans.
The arena's location, on Claypit Lane is situated at the Northern Quarter of Leeds city centre, behind the Merrion Centre. The land the arena is being built on is the Claypit Lane Council car park and land formerly owned by Leeds Metropolitan University. Demolition of the former Leeds Metropolitan building was completed in 2009.
Independent economic impact assessments conducted by Yorkshire Forward show that the new arena will bring over £25 million to the local economy every year and bring 300 full-time jobs. The money provided by Leeds City Council will come from part of the proceeds from their sale of Leeds Bradford International Airport in October 2007, Yorkshire Forward grant support and revenues from rent and commercial activities. The total scheme costs are estimated to be in the region of £80 million including land costs.
The arena will be constructed in a super theatre fan shaped format as opposed to the more conventional bowl or horse-shoe seating arrangement commonly used by most arenas in the United Kingdom. The arena promises 'perfect sightlines' from each seat and the longest distance from the stage will be 68 metres as opposed to 95–110 metres at a traditionally designed Arena. According to the City Council, flat floor seating and 15 rows of retractable seating can be removed to create a huge floor area holding thousands of standing spectators. The interior design is flexible and the First Direct Arena will be able to accommodate a range of events including:
The external design was announced in August 2010. The external design has a honeycomb design. This design uses – a voronoi diagram – to create cellular shapes that are visible on key approaches to the arena.
On an evening, the front of the building will have the ability to change colour or pattern dependant on the show or mood of the arena at the time.
Construction.
Construction work on the First Direct Arena commenced in February 2011. Construction was completed by May 2013, with a public open day scheduled for 25 May.
Naming rights.
On 2 May 2013, telephone and internet bank First Direct were announced as the sponsor of the arena, with the name officially becoming the First Direct Arena. The naming rights will expire in 2018.
Opposition from South Yorkshire.
Yorkshire Forward's support and intended £18 million funding has gained much publicity and has been subject to fierce political fighting. Some critics outlined that public funding is common on most recent Arena developments as seen in the Manchester, Nottingham and Liverpool developments. Each arena gained public funding and this was not protested by other established arenas. However, there was some opposition to the Leeds Arena from the owners of Sheffield Arena and Clive Betts, MP for Sheffield Attercliffe, who believe that the arena would adversely affect Sheffield Arena especially as the Leeds Arena would acquire funding from Yorkshire Forward. However, Yorkshire Forward stated that they fully support the development of an arena in Leeds and that an independent economic impact assessment also showed that a Leeds Arena would be of benefit to the entire region. Subsequently, Yorkshire Forward reaffirmed support to provide funding to the scheme. However, following a decision by BIS, central government initially did not authorise Yorkshire Forward to provide funding to the scheme. Soon after, it was announced that £9.9 million funding was authorised by central government. This was met with fierce criticism from Sheffield MPs, but received positive responses in the Leeds City Region.
Events.
The first event in the arena was a concert by Bruce Springsteen on 24 July 2013 although the arena officially opened in September 2013. A wide variety of events have already taken place or been scheduled, including:
Comedy.
Miranda Hart, Russell Howard, Micky Flanagan, Lee Evans.

On Thursday 20 March 2014, it will play host to week 7 of the 2014 Premier League Darts
Transport.
The arena is located in Leeds city centre, on Claypit Lane. There are over 7500 car parking spaces within a 15 minute walk of the arena, and Leeds railway station and Leeds City bus station are each a 15 minute walk away. There are bus stands nearby on Woodhouse Lane. The proposed Next Generation Transport trolleybus will run close to the arena.

<doc id="20122145" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20122145" title="Nainital Lake">
Nainital Lake

Nainital Lake, a natural freshwater body, situated amidst the township of Nainital in Uttarakhand State of India, tectonic in origin, is kidney shaped or crescent shaped and has an outfall at the southeastern end.
Nainital Lake, in the Nainital district called the Lake District of India, is one of the four Lakes of Kumaon hills; the other three lakes are the Sattal Lake, the Bhimtal Lake and the Naukuchiyatal Lake.
History.
Historical records confirm that in 1839, Mr. P. Barron, from Rosa, an English business man in sugar trade, on a hunting expedition accidentally coming across the lake at Nainital was so captivated that he decided to build a European Colony on shores of the lake. The news magazine, the "Englishman Calcutta", reported in 1841 discovery of this lake near Almora.
Topography and Hydrology.
The lake is bounded by the high and steep Naina peak on the North West side, by the Tiffin Top to the south west side and snow view peaks on the north. Coniferous forest trees cover these hill ranges. The annual rainfall in the basin area of the lake is reported to be 1294.5 mm (43.15 inches). Tropical monsoon climate with maximum temperature 24.6 °C and minimum of 0.5 °C are recorded. The water is reported to be alkaline in nature (ph value of 8.4–9.3).
The lake receives flows from the surrounding catchment basin which comprises the hill slopes and springs. The hydrologic studies related to water balance and sedimentation was done using radioisotopes for estimating/measuring the various components of the inflow and outflow into the lake. Studies indicated that the subsurface inflow and outflow were significant – ranging from 43 to 63% and 41 to 54%, respectively, of the total inflow and outflow, except in years of exceptionally heavy rainfall. The components of outflows were the surface outflow, the subsurface outflow through the springs on the downstream side and draft through wells for meeting the water supply of Nainital town and evaporation loss from the lake surface. The mean water retention time for the lake was computed as 1.16 years for the mean annual rainfall.
Geology.
The Krol group of rocks, comprising slates, marls, sandstones, limestones and dolomites with a few small dykes intrusives, is the dominant geological formation of the lake’s surroundings. The lake is deduced to have been formed tectonically. Balia Nala, which is the main stream feeding the lake is along a fault line and the subsequent streams align parallel to major joints and faults. 26 major drains feed the lake including the 3 perennial drains. The lake catchment has highly folded and faulted rocks due to poly phase deformation. Landslides are a frequent occurrence in the hill slopes surrounding the lake, which are steep. The slopes are highly vulnerable to landslides and mass movement due to various geological and human factors. Several landslides have occurred in the past (pictured) around the lake. Many settlements around the lake are located in landslide areas.
Flora and fauna.
While the Nainital district where the lake is situated (in the middle Himalayan ranges up to , a temperate zone), is rich in flora (typical temperate climate plants) and fauna, the details of the flora and fauna specific to the lake and its surroundings recorded are the following.
Vegetation.
The trees and bushes grown in the region (lake’s basin) with their botanical and common Indian names (in parenthesis) are reported to be: a) Quercus incana Oak (Banj)}; b) Aesculus indica (Pangar or Horse chestnuts); c) Juglans regia (Akhrot or walnut), d) Populous ciliata (Hill Pipal, a sacred tree); e) Fraxinus miscrantha (Ash tree or Angu); f) Platanus orientalis (Chinar); g) Rubus lasiocarpus (Hisalu); h) Rosa moschata (Kunj or Musk rose); i) Berberis asiatica (Kilmora);j) Cupressus torulosa (Surai or Himalayan cypress); k) Rhododendron arboreum (Buruns); Cedrus deodara (Deodar); l) Salix acmophylla (Weeping Willow); and m) Pinus (Pine). 
The Aquatic Macrophytic vegetation recorded are the a) Potamogeton pectinatus, 2) Potamogeton crispus, 3) Polygonum glabrum, 4) Polygonum amphibium and Polygonum hydropiper (Water pepper).
Several species of medicinal flora and horticulture plants have also been reported.
Aqua fauna.
The fishes found in the lake are generally carps Mahseer, (the Hindi name of mahāsir, mahāser, or mahāsaulā used for a number of fishes of the group), also hill trout and the mirror carp which breed several times during one spawning season during May to September. Two species of Mahaseer fish viz., Tor tor: The red finned mahseer and the Tor putitora: The yellow finned mahseer, a food fish which grows to varying sizes from 20 to 60 Cms (7.87 to 23.62 inches) are reported. The three species of Hill Trout found in the lake are the Schizothorax sinuatus, Schizothorax richardsoni and Schizothorax plagiostornus. The imported fish bred in the lake is Mirror carp or Cyprinus carpio. Gambusia affinis also called Mosquitofish have been introduced in the lake as a biocontrol measure to control Mosquito larvae.
Fauna.
Nine species of birds and nine species of animals have been recorded in the Nainital district.
Water quality.
A scientific study indicates that the open drains feeding the lake introduce toxic substances from the catchment of the lake, particularly heavy metals which get adsorbed onto the suspended sediments, which in turn settle down in the bottom of the lake. A study of the risk assessment code has revealed that 4–13% of manganese, 4–8% of copper, 17–24% of nickel, 3–5% of chromium, 13–26% of lead, 14–23% of cadmium and 2–3% of zinc exist in exchangeable fraction which puts the lake under the low to medium risk category and infers that it could enter into food chain and also cause deleterious effects to aquatic life. This study provides the basic database to formulate guidelines for the dredging operations and/or restoration programmes in the lake.
The water quality studies carried out by the National Institute of Hydrology during 1999–2001 on physico-chemical parameters (pH, temperature profile, Secchi’s transparency, dissolved oxygen, BOD, COD and nutrients), biological profile (density of population, biomass and species diversity of phyto, zooplankton and macrobenthos) and bacteriological characteristics have led to the conclusion that long-term limnological changes have occurred in the lake. Excess of nutrients inflow have contributed to the eutrophic conditions and the internal recycling of nutrients from sediments during water circulation has resulted in luxurious growth of phytoplankton. The lake is thus anoxic and has reduced hypolimnion, winter circulation, large phytoplankton and relatively lower animal population.
Threats to the lake.
The problems facing the lake which were also listed in the plea in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) before the Supreme Court of India in 1995 seeking court directive for redress measures could be summarised as below:
Lake restoration.
The National Institute of Hydrology (NIH) of Roorkee who prepared a plan for the restoration of the lake, at an estimated cost of Rs 50 crore (about US $ 10 million), sponsored by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, are also now guiding the restoration measures. The Conservation and Management Plan evolved by NIH is not only lake centric but also proposes to tackle the immediate periphery of the lake which contributes an adverse impact on the lake. The “Nainital Jheel Parikshetra Vishesh Kshetra Vikas Pradhikaran”, the Lake Development Authority notified under U.P. Special Area Development Act 1986 is a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) set up for implementing the restoration works. The restoration works that have been implemented or are in different stages of implementation are the following:
The Honourable Supreme Court of India in its judgment of 1995, in response to the Public Interest Litigation, gave the following recommendations which have also been addressed in the restoration measures mentioned above.
"(i)Sewage water has to be prevented at any cost from entering the lake; (ii) So far as the drains which ultimately fall in the lake are concerned, it has to be seen that building materials are not allowed to be heaped on the drains to prevent siltation of the lake;(iii) Care has been taken to see that horse dung does not reach the lake. If for this purpose the horse stand has to be shifted somewhere, the same would be done. The authorities would examine whether trotting of horses around the lake is also required to be prevented;(iv) Multi-storeyed group housing and commercial complexes have to be banned in the town area of Naini Tal. Building of small residential houses on flat areas could, however, be permitted;(v) The offence of illegal felling of trees is required to be made cognizable.(vi) Vehicular traffic on the Mall has to be reduced. Heavy vehicles may not be permitted to ply on Mall;(vii) The fragile nature of Ballia Ravine has to be taken care of. The cracks in the revetment of Ballia Nullah have to be repaired urgently."
In the “India Today” magazine, Prasanta Rajan, a journalist, in a preamble to the particular interest shown by the Lady District Magistrate of Nainital in restoration works of the lake has very vividly described the lake in these words: 
"Look for the lake through the colonial windows of Pant House, a vintage English bungalow on the hilltop, now submerged in wintry night, solitary with a kind of Wuthering Heights mystery. Down below, the lake is a laminated stillness, protected by seven never-sleeping hills. In the dead darkness of Kumaon, this magnificence is a distant, partially lit vision, less than real, as the hills of frozen memories make the lake a footnote in water".
Other attractions.
There is the Nainital Boat Club that offers yachting facilities at the lake. The Annual Kingfisher Yachting Competition (Regatta) is held here in the third week of June. The Kumaon festival which brings out the local cultures and traditions is organized every year during the winter months of October and November, by the Tourism Department.

LT&amp;SR 51 Class

The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway 51 class was a class of 4-4-2T steam locomotives. Twelve were built by Sharp, Stewart and Company to the design of Thomas Whitelegg for the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway in 1900, with North British Locomotive Company supplying an additional six in 1903. The LTSR numbered them 51–68, and named them places in London and Essex.
They entered Midland Railway stock in 1912. The Midland gave them the power classification 2P, and renumbered them 2158–2175. They subsequently entered London, Midland and Scottish Railway stock in 1923. They retained their ex-Midland Railway numbers until 1930 when they were renumbered 2092–2109.
Number 2105 was withdrawn in 1947, and the remaining seventeen of these entered British Railways stock in 1948, and were to be renumbered 41910–41926, but only three (41922, 41923 and 41925) survived to carry their new numbers. The last was withdrawn in 1953. None was preserved.

Armenia–Hungary relations

Armenia–Hungary relations refer to the diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and Hungary.
Background.
Diplomatic relations between the two nations started at the end of the Cold War, mainly with the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
There are around 15,000 people of Armenian descent living in Hungary.
Severing of diplomatic relations.
On 31 August 2012, Armenia severed relations with Hungary following the extradition of Ramil Safarov – convicted of murdering Armenian Lieutenant Gurgen Margaryan in Hungary in 2004 – to Azerbaijan. Safarov was pardoned upon returning despite the assurances of the Ministry of Justice to Hungary that his sentence would be enforced. The move follows a deteriorating Armenian-Azeri relationship since a ceasefire ended the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994.
In Yerevan, protesters threw tomatoes at the building of Hungary's honorary consulate and tore down the flag of Hungary. The United States also criticised the decision to free Safarov. In 2013 April, Armenia’s acting Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian said that "Armenia ready to settle relations with Hungary, but Budapest should undertake steps".

Veterans Aid

Veteran's Aid is a UK charity for Veterans in crisis. It operates from an HQ and Drop-in Centre at 40 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 0RE, just a few minutes walk from Victoria Station. It also operates a hostel called New Belvedere House in East London (Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Army, RAF or Merchant Navy).
History.
Veterans Aid started life in 1932 as EFC. In 2007 it was renamed Veterans Aid and its remit extended from homelessness to all issues affecting veterans in crisis.
It was founded by the wife of Major Gilbert Huggins after her husband narrowly escaped death by drowning in Malta's Grand Harbour.
Grateful for what she considered to be a miracle of deliverance, she started looking for some way in which she could be of service. Being frequently approached for money by homeless Veterans in London, she decided to establish an organisation to help them. This led to the opening in January 1932 of H10 - a canteen and recreation room for destitute ex-services personnel in Lambeth, South London.
Additional accommodation was obtained, including a hostel and a night shelter, and in 1933, the title Embankment Fellowship Centre (EFC) was adopted. In March 1969 the name was changed to Ex-Service Fellowship Centres (the acronym EFC being retained). In October 2007, the Trustees decided that the name of the charity should be changed to "Veterans Aid" in order to reflect more accurately the nature of the work done.
It operates from an HQ and Drop-in Centre at 40 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 0RE, a few minutes walk from Victoria Station. It also operates a hostel called New Belvedere House in East London.

Doug Rickard (26 May 1939 – 7 May 2002) was an Australian-born space engineer. He is known for his stories of engineering while at the Woomera Deep Space Station. He died in 2002 from myelofibrosis caused by contact with Cobalt-60 while working at the Maralinga nuclear test facility.
Some of his stories have been collected by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, whose logo he possibly inspired (although the logo was designed by Bill Kennard), under the title "Memoirs of a space engineer". Additional humorous engineering stories include hand-decoding images from Mariner 4 onto a sheet of graph paper since NASA JPL had only built a single display system, running a magnetic tape recorder 25 times over its rated speed to have enough bandwidth to record Ranger 9 video of its impact on the moon, and an impromptu excavation of Pompeii's plumbing systems.
Doug also worked for some time for the Australian subsidiary of Digital Equipment Corporation. During that time he was seconded to Project Athena, the Campuswide Computing environment developed at MIT, with the specific responsibility of developing "Bones" a version of the Kerberos Authentication System, that did not relying on strong encryption, and as such would not require US Government approval for export.

He is best remembered as the author of "Imperialism: Pioneer of Capitalism". This unconventional Marxist analysis was published posthumously in 1980 and is still being debated.
Some commentators have likened Warren's ideas on capitalism, particularly his belief
that the creation of a global market is required for the creation of a Communist
society, to other thinkers,such as the Revolutionary Communist Party and

Leicester Falcons

The Leicester Falcons are a British American football team based in Leicester, England. The Falcons play in the National League Central of the British American Football Association National Leagues.
History.
The Leicester Falcons were formed in 2006 by general manager Guy Kersey and a nucleus of local players hoping to share their enjoyment and knowledge of the sport. Named in connection with Leicester Eagles, the regional flag football team, the Leicester Falcons held their first training session at Belgrave Rugby Club on 19 March 2006. After two seasons of associate membership, the Falcons achieved full membership of the British American Football League prior to the 2008 season.
The Falcons' first season in BAFL Division 2 Central ended with a 3–5–2 record, under head coach Danny Gaunt.
The 2009 season proved to be much better, with a regular season record of 7–2–1. Lester Hopewell took over as head coach, and led the Falcons to a playoff place. In the playoffs the Falcons beat Manchester Titans and Glasgow Tigers to reach their first championship game. In a tight game Leicester Falcons defeated Colchester Gladiators 33:32 to become the BAFL Division 2 Champions for 2009. This also secured promotion and the Falcons now play in BAFA Community Leagues Division 1.
The 2010 season contained a number of highlights. The team celebrated the 25th Anniversary of the Leicester charity LOROS by holding their league match against Birmingham Bulls at the Welford Road ground of Leicester Tigers. To crown the day the Falcons won a well-fought game to claim their first victory of the season 22 :15. To bolster the team for the second half of the season the team signed ex-NFL quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt, who had previously played for Denver Broncos and subsequently Houston Texans. This had the desired effect and helped an improving team to win its next four matches and secure a wildcard place in the 2010 season play-offs. Despite having a weakened team the Falcons made the number 1 seeded team, East Kilbride Pirates, work very hard to secure their place in the semi-finals; the Falcons lost a close fought game by only two points.
Following a realignment of the teams in BAFACL Division 1 the Leicester Falcons played in the Central Conference in 2011. This proved to be a successful season for the Falcons, who finished top of the conference with a 9–1 record. However, in a controversial ending to the season, BAFANL stripped the Falcons of the conference title and deducted one game after being found to have not followed proper transfer procedure in the transfer of Jason Brisbane. The Falcons therefore entered the playoffs as the #4 seed. In the playoffs, the Falcons beat Doncaster Mustangs in the quarter finals, before a famous upset win against top seeds London Olympians in the semifinal, to set up a rematch with East Kilbride Pirates at Britbowl XXV. This ended in a 62–23 defeat.
Following a divisional restructure, BAFA confirmed that the Falcons would be promoted to an expanded Premier Division for 2012, and will play in the Premier Division North. The Falcons began the season with two ties and a loss, before a controversial match against Doncaster Mustangs. Leicester won the match, but the result was overturned after BAFA determined the Falcons had fielded ineligible players. The fallout from this led to numerous players leaving, and the Falcons had to forfeit their remaining games. As a result, both head coach Stuart Franklin and interim GM Colin Branagh left their positions. The only Falcons organisation team to complete their season were the U16 youth team, who finished their inaugural season with a credible 3–9 record.
The 2013 season.
Following the Falcons' relegation from the Premier League after the previous season's fiasco, the Falcons organisation rebuilt from the ground up. Following Guy Kersey's departure to the USA, Saul Freer took over as chairman and began a second stint as head coach, leading a new player-run committee. The new-look team, consisting mainly of rookie players, won their first game against Crewe Railroaders 34–26 but lost their next two games by large scores. They went on to finish the season 6-4, in the process beating long standing rivals Shropshire Revolution in a tight game.
The Falcons Academy.
As part of the team's continued growth and to help ensure its future, as well as to provide an entry point for teenagers who wish to enjoy the sport of American football, the Falcons are looking for the next generation of players to join the organisation.
The Falcons started a youth programme in the autumn of 2009 to fill the gap between junior Flag Football and adult contact football. In 2011, they entered the BAFACL Junior division for the first time and finished their inaugural season with a 1–7 record, with the sole win coming against Coventry Jets. 2011 also saw the debut of the Falcons' university team, in association with De Montfort University.
2012 saw the debut of an under 16 team, playing five a side contact football, and the restructure of the junior setup into the Falcons Academy. The youth team, coached by Karl Burgess and Joel Pearson, completed their first season with a 3–9 record.

James W. Pumphrey

James W. Pumphrey (September 12, 1832 – March 16, 1906) was the owner of a livery stable in Washington, D.C., and played a minor role in the events surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and its aftermath. John Wilkes Booth hired a horse from Pumphrey that he used to escape with after he assassinated the President.
Early life and family.
James Pumphrey was born in Washington, D.C., to Levi Pumphrey and Sarah Pumphrey née Miller, and was one of six children. Upon the death of his father, being the eldest son, James inherited a livery stable at the corner of C Street and 6th Street.
James Pumphrey had two "common law" marriages and fathered seven children. He and his first wife, Margaret, had two children: Ida Elizabeth and James W., Jr. With his second wife, Mary, he fathered five children: Sarah, Mary, Josephine, Percival, and Edward.
The day of the assassination.
Pumphrey was an acquaintance of conspirator John Surratt and it was Surratt who introduced Booth to him prior to the assassination. Pumphrey's stable was located near the National Hotel, which was Booth's Washington residence at the time. Booth had been hiring one particular horse, which he preferred, from Pumphrey.
On April 14, 1865, after learning that Lincoln would attend that evening's performance of the play "Our American Cousin", Booth went directly from Ford's Theatre to Pumphrey's livery stable to make arrangements for procuring a horse. Pumphrey informed Booth that the horse he usually hired was unavailable. Therefore Booth hired a different one, a swift little bay mare with a white star on her forehead and a black tail and mane.
Booth told Pumphrey that he would be back to get it at around four o'clock that afternoon. 
At the hour agreed upon, Booth arrived at the stable. Pumphrey warned Booth that the horse was high spirited and she would break her halter if left unattended.
Booth mentioned to Pumphrey that he was going to Grover's Theatre, the former name of the National Theatre, as he had to write an important letter. He added that he planned afterwards to stop for a drink and then take a leisurely ride. Booth did write a letter, but not at Grover's Theatre. He wrote the letter at the National Hotel; it was written to the editor of a Washington D.C. newspaper called the "National Intelligencer". In the letter, he explained that his plans had changed from kidnapping Lincoln to assassinating him. In addition to signing his own name, he also added those of his co-conspirators: Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, and David Herold. Later, Booth did get a drink at Peter Taltavull's Star Saloon located next to Ford's Theatre, but he definitely did not go on a pleasure ride. Instead, Booth approached Edmund Spangler, an acquaintance and stage hand at Ford's Theatre, with the request to hold the reins of the skittish mare that he hired, while he briefly attended to some business within the theater. This business was murdering Lincoln.
After the assassination, Booth and Herold made good an escape to Virginia. Prior to crossing the Potomac River and while hiding out in some woods, Herold killed Pumphrey's horse along with his own because the horses were no longer needed.
Temporary imprisonment.
In the turmoil that followed Lincoln's assassination, scores of suspected accomplices were arrested and thrown into prison by the United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Stanton vigorously pursued the apprehension and prosecution of the conspirators involved in Lincoln's assassination. All the people who were discovered to have had anything to do with the assassination or anyone with the slightest contact with Booth or Herold on their flight were put behind bars. Pumphrey, having supplied the get away horse, was jailed. Ultimately, the suspects were narrowed down to a group of eight prisoners—seven men and one woman—and, along with many others, Pumphrey was released.
On May 15, 1865, Pumphrey testified for the Prosecution and described the horse he provided to Booth and the details of how that transaction came about.
Pumphrey's last part in the events surrounding the assassination was to wait mounted on his horse for hours outside the Old Arsenal Penitentiary. He waited in the hope of having the privilege of carrying President Andrew Johnson's reprieve to Mary Surratt. While Pumphrey regarded Mrs. Surratt as wholly innocent and exhibited the deepest sympathy for her, no reprieve was to come. On July 7, 1865, she was hanged with three of the other conspirators.
Later life and death.
Pumphrey continued to operate the livery stable until some time after 1900. The demise of his stable, like many others of the day, was caused by the advent of the automobile. On 16 March 1906, Pumphrey died in Washington, DC. He is buried in Congressional Cemetery.
Obituary.
The following is Pumphrey's obituary in "The Evening Star", Washington, DC. It is from page 9 of the issue dated 16 March 1906:

Gisborough Hall

Gisborough Hall is a 19th-century mansion house, now a hotel, at Guisborough, Redcar and Cleveland, England. It is a Grade II listed building.
The manor of Gisborough and the site of the dissolved Priory of Gisborough were acquired after the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Sir Thomas Chaloner in about 1558. He built a new manor house adjacent to the Priory ruins. His grandson was Sir William Chaloner Bt.
The manor house was demolished in the early 19th century when the family moved to Long Hull. In 1842 Admiral Thomas Chaloner inherited the estate and in 1856 created the present mansion house.
The house, in Jacobean style, presents a main south front of two storeys and attics behind balustrades, with seven bays, the central and two end bays being canted and gabled.
On his death without issue, the Admiral left the estate to his great nephew Richard Godolphin Walmesley Long (younger brother of Viscount Long) who in 1888 changed his surname to Chaloner. He was created Baron Gisborough in 1917 and died at the Hall in 1938.
The estate was sold by the family in the 1940s and the house was used as an old people's home for some years. In 2002 it was restored by new owners and converted to use as an hotel.

Laura Bradford

Laura Bradford (born January 9, 1957) was a legislator in the U.S. state of Colorado. Elected to the Colorado House of Representatives as a Republican in 2008, Bradford represented House District 55, which encompasses northern portions of Mesa County and northern Grand Junction from 2008 to 2012.
Biography.
Early life and career.
Born in Crookston, Minnesota and raised in Stephen, after moving to Montana and working at Yellowstone National Park at the age of 18, Bradford settled in Colorado, living in Denver, Greeley, and Aspen, before moving to Grand Junction, Colorado in 1981. Bradford has been married three times; she and her husband, Linton Mathews, have three children: Elizabeth, Meredith, and Preston.
After founding several sewing-related businesses, Bradford founded ProSafe Products in 1987, a small business manufacturing fitted covers and garments for medical and dental applications. Her family opened a tree farm in 2006 on land near Collbran, Colorado.
She joined the Women's Success Forum at the University of Denver Daniels College of Business in 1998, and was featured in the 1999 book "Women Who Mean Business". She was a member of the Colorado Women's Economic Development Council from 1995 to 2000, and, in 1999, was appointed its chair by Gov. Bill Owens, and also sat on the Mesa County Revolving Loan Fund Administration Loan Review Committee.
An amateur musician, Bradford has been treasurer for the Messiah Choral Society and directed her church's English Handbell Choir. She has served in various positions with the Republican party, and became House District 55 chair in 2002.
Legislative career.
2008 election.
Bradford began considering a run for the house seat, meeting with Republican leaders, in 2007, as did former state senator Ron Teck. When Teck declined to run in August 2008, Bradford was left as the leading contender for the seat. She had no opposition in the August 2008 Republican primary, but faced incumbent Democratic Rep. Bernie Buescher in the November 2008 general election. Buescher was widely-expected to become the next Speaker of the House if re-elected. Buescher's candidacy was endorsed by the "Denver Post".
Bradford ran a campaign focused on fiscal and economic issues, particularly attempting to link Buescher with Gov. Bill Ritter and their support of a controversial mill levy freeze.
Buescher was targeted by flyers from Focus on the Family Action and other 527 groups during the campaign. Bradford was also criticized by outside groups as failing to support cancer screenings, a charge she rebutted by citing her own bout with cancer. Bradford aired television commercials responding to attacks from 527 groups, some of which were briefly taken off the air and revised after it was discovered that a photograph of Buescher, taken by a "Grand Junction Daily Sentinel" reporter and used in the ad, was used without proper permission.
Bradford, running in a district with a 2:1 Republican voter registration advantage, received a late-minute boost from a visit by Republican presidential candidate John McCain on election day. As returns came in, Bradford and Buescher traded leads, with Bradford leading at the end of the night. By the following day, Bradford's lead settled at about 600 votes, more than 1 percent of ballots cast. Buescher conceded defeat the day after the election.
After defeating Buescher, Bradford received a standing ovation when first meeting with the House Republican caucus later in the week.
2009 legislative session.
For the 2009 legislative session, Bradford was named to seats on the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee and the House Local Government Committee, where she was the ranking Republican member.
The first bill introduced by Bradford was a measure to update laws governing Colorado's statewide voter registration database into compliance with federal regulations.
Bradford has announced her intention to support an expansion of the personal property tax exemption, a bill her opponent Buescher had promoted, and has publicly supported efforts to pass a version of Jessica's Law in Colorado, mandating stricter sentencing for sex offenders, and is expected to introduce a version of the legislation with Reps. Frank McNulty and Scott Tipton.
Drunk driving.
On January 25, 2012, Bradford was pulled over by Denver police after making an illegal turn. After the officer smelled alcohol on her breath, Bradford admitted to police that she had been drinking. Upon administering roadside sobriety tests, the officer called a supervisor to receive advice. Denver Police later claimed that Bradford then invoked Article V Section 16, of the Colorado Constitution, which provides for legislative immunity:
The representative, however, claims she never invoked legislative immunity; a claim which was substantiated by a House ethics committee. Bradford was issued a traffic ticket and her vehicle was impounded by Denver Police. Bradford later told a journalist that she drank three and a half glasses of wine during the night in question. She later delivered an apology on the House floor.
2012 election.
Bradford did not stand for reelection in 2012 and was succeeded by Republican politician Ray Scott who won election with 58% of the vote.

Portugal–Russia relations

Portugal–Russia relations are foreign relations between Portugal and Russia. Portugal has an embassy in Moscow while Russia has an embassy in Lisbon.
Both countries are the first country in Europe to the west and east, respectively, and they both have very good relations with each other. Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
History.
Full, ambassador-level, diplomatic relations between Portugal and the Russian Empire date back to 1779. Earlier, in 1724, Portuguese merchants appealed to Peter I to establish trading missions. Peter responded with appointment of a consul in Lisbon. There is no evidence, however, that the Lisbon consulate was actually established at that time. Trading between the two countries developed slowly, and the Russian consulate in Lisbon finally opened in 1769, headed by João António Borscher, a Portuguese-German banker from Hamburg. Borscher was not keenly interested in promoting Portuguese business interests, and trade between the two countries remained insignificant.
In September 1779, Maria I appointed the former ambassador in the Netherlands, Francisco José Horta Macedo, as Portugal's ambassador to Russia based in Saint Petersburg. Catherine II responded with appointing Count Wilhelm Nesselrode as an ambassador to Portugal. These contacts resulted in the 1782 Treaty on Armed Neutrality and the 1787 Treaty on Commerce. In 1799, the two countries signed a defensive alliance that did not precipitate into direct military action.
For most of the 19th century, relationships remained uneventful, gaining momentum in the last decade of the century when the Imperial Russian Navy regularly used Portuguese ports for replenishments. The crew of imperial yacht "Tsesarevna" in particular was hailed for their action in fighting the 1895 fire at the Portuguese Parliament. However, during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, Portugal sided with the United Kingdom and refused to allow the Russian Navy access to its ports. After the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia, the ties between two countries were severed and not re-established until 1977.

Felix Mann

Felix Mann (born 10 April 1931) is a German-born acupuncturist. He devised the system known as Scientific Acupuncture and is the founder and past-president of the Medical Acupuncture Society (1959–1980). He was also the first president of the British Medical Acupuncture Society (1980), and the author of the first comprehensive English language acupuncture textbook "Acupuncture: The Ancient Chinese Art of Healing" first published in 1962. In 1995, he received The German Pain Prize. Mann, who is based in England, has also lectured internationally on medical acupuncture. 
Criticism of basic acupuncture concepts.
Mann seemingly distanced himself from beliefs in the existence of acupuncture points and meridians. He has stated in his book "Reinventing Acupuncture: A New Concept of Ancient Medicine":
This merely implies an objection against the notion of point-like areas in certain positions:
And regarding meridians…
Also this is an objection against a perceived rigidity in the traditions:
"...the original, probably correct, observations were taken up by scholars who then processed something simple into something complicated, in their masterful, scholarly way. Possibly they wished the meridians in microcosm man to simulate the pathway of the planets in the celestial macrocosm and thus produced the truly amazing course of the meridians, coursing three times round the whole body.
However, despite the fact that I criticise the present description of acupuncture points and meridians, it will be apparent that I could never have evolved my own ideas without the stimulus of the
traditional structures." (p. 36)
New concepts.
Mann had in his later years introduced some new acupuncture concepts he had found important.
He regarded a significant part – perhaps as much as 50% of the patients – as "strong reactors":
This implies that the traditional acupuncture treatment – using many needles through many minutes – would be too strong and hence inefficient for the many strong reactors.
Mann introduced a new acupuncture method that he regarded as stronger than traditional skin acupuncture: Periosteal acupuncture. (p. 91)
This involves inserting the needles into the periosteum – almost all the way down to the bone.

Baumgardner was criticised for falling asleep during a House session and also faced revelations that an unregistered sex offender lived at his house and worked on his farm. Nevertheless, Baumgardner won the Republican nomination, taking 58% of the vote. White refused to endorse him, saying "I'll have a hard time supporting a dishonest man. The lies prevailed. His lies beat my truth. It shows that running an upright and honest campaign doesn't necessarily win the day. This is a man who lied to me. He lied about me. He lied about where he lives, what he does and how he votes." During the general election, Baumgardner defeated his Democratic opponent Emily Tracy with 51.1% of the vote.
2013 legislative session.
Senator Baumgardner was appointed to serve on the Senate Business, Labor, and Technology Committee, Capital Development Committee, and the Transportation Committee.

Castlegregory GAA

Castlegregory are a Gaelic Athletic Association club based in the parish of Castlegregory in Kerry, Ireland. This is a Gaelic football only club, with no hurling played. The club is a member of the West Kerry division of Kerry GAA. They play their home games in the newly renovated surrounds of Pairc An Caislean located just outside the parish's main village of the same name.
The club fields teams at all age groups from U10 through to Senior and has an excellent record at underage level with regular representation on county teams from U16 - U21.
Many Castlegregory players have been honoured at Munster Colleges level with Tralee CBS and at Sigerson Cup level with various third level institutions. The success of the outstanding Micheál O'Shea with UCC stands out in the minds of most along witn Seán Mahoney with ITT.
History.
Football was played in Castlegregory long before the GAA was founded in 1884.
The game of Caid was played in the parish of Castlegregory long before, and even after, the foundation of the GAA in Thurles in 1884. Caid itself seems to have been a combination of rough and tumble football and cross country running - the contestants being teams from neighbouring parishes.
One such game took place between Castle and Cloghane in 1886 at Dowling's Big Field in Stradbally with both sides claiming victory. A replay finally took place 2 years later with Cloghane winning. A local balladeer recalled the game in a song called "The Kickers of Lios na Caol Bhuidhe" which contains the immortal line: " ..they'd kick all before them from here to Tralee" Another line recounts events when the game became a little too robust: "The referee, with his whistle, was up on top a tree".!!!
The first official GAA club of the parish was known as Castlegregory Allen - in memory of William Allen, one of the Manchester Martyrs Allen, Larkin and O'Brien. The club took part in the first Kerry County Championship played in 1889 in which they met a team called Ó Breannan. After two draws, the second replay was played in Castle on 10 April, but the game was abandoned after O'Breannan refused to continue when Castle scored a disputed goal. However, as you would, both teams retired to a local hostelry and had a night of singing and dancing.
The first recorded meeting of the club took place in October 1889 and Mr Thomas Moore was elected president and the officers elected with him were Silvester Egan, Hugh O'Flaherty. Michael Kelliher, John Fitzgerald, Eugene Foran and Michael O'Sullivan. John Foran and Thomas McCarthy were elected captain and vice captain respectively. Tom O'Flaherty from Fahamore soon became Honorary Secretary of the Kerry County Board and not long after Castle became a proper affiliated club
Competitions.
Kerry GAA competitions are divided into two distinct branches - divisional and county.
In divisional competitions, teams face off against their neighbours from within their own geographical area. In Castlegregory's case, this means that they play against other West Kerry clubs such as Dingle, An Gaeltacht, Lispole, St. Pats, Blennerville and fierce rivals Annascaul.
County competitions involve matches against opposition from throughout County Kerry and are independent of divisional championships.
Castlegregory also send players to form part of the West Kerry divisional team which competes in the Kerry County Championships at Minor, U21 and Senior levels.
Club Foundations: Bord na nÓg.
All of Castlegregory's underage teams take part in similar county Gaelic football and divisional competitions.
Castle have regularly been strong contenders in their county league divisions, winning several titles at all underage brackets over the past 20 years or so, most notably a County Minor 3-in-a-row side in the mid 90's.
Senior.
2009 Kerry Junior County Champions. 2009 Munster Junior Champions. Castle defeated Mountcollins of Limerick by a score of 1-20 to 0-4 on 13 December 2009. Great celebrations and speech making were seen in the village the night after the match especially by team trainer Ger Callaghan and team captain Adrian 'Sammy' Finn of the Maharees. Castle followed up this fine win in January 2010 by defeating Longwood of Meath in the All Ireland semi-final by a score of 1-16 to 0-8. Another fine win witnessed in Limerick by many who travelled from West Kerry for the game. Castle went on to meet Kiltimagh of Mayo in the final played on Valentine's Day, 2010. In a tight encounter the game finished level on a score of 0-12 to 1-9 after normal time so a 20 minute period of extra time was played. In extra time Castle came out on top and showed their superior fitness to become the first club from West Kerry to win an All-Ireland club title defeating Kiltimagh 0-15 to 1-14.
In 2009 Castle also won promotion from Division 3 of the county league.
Parish Leagues.
As a large parish - end to end is about 30 miles - comprising many sizeable townlands and villages, early Castle teams suffered from logistical difficulties when it came to the organisation of training sessions.
To overcome this, a parish league was formed which pitted the best 15 from each or the larger townlands against each other. The main protagonists included teams from Cloghane, Stradbally, Aughausla, Camp, Maharees and Castlegregory.
As the local population declined many townlands had trouble finding 15 players, to the point where the parish league was disbanded.
In its place, we now have an annual once off game between the East of the Parish and the West of the Parish. These clashes take place every December, normally around St Stephen's Day.
Often tough affairs, featuring a cameo or two from former greats who just doesn't know when to lie down, the matches usually draw a large crowd.
Some things never change though and once the old scores are settled and rivalries renewed, it all ends with a trophy presentation and a pint in one of Castle's well known watering holes.
Notable players.
Castlegregory has had some wonderful players through the years, many of whom never made it into a Kerry shirt but may well have been able to lay claim to one. Of those who did, Pat O'Shea and Tom Moriarty are two of the most notable. Both are featured in the book "Princes Of Pigskin", which chronicles the men and women who have made Kerry great.

Paul Frantz

Paul Frantz (born 10 March 1927 in Wittisheim) is a former French football manager.
Career.
A physical education teacher, he never played as a professional, a fact that did nor prevent him from earning his 3rd level manager degree – necessary to coach pro teams in France – as valedictorian in 1958. He was the first manager with no experience as a pro player to do that. After several spells with amateur teams, he was named manager of RC Strasbourg in 1964. He led the Strasbourg team to a good run in the Inter-Cities Fairs cup in 1964–1965 ousting AC Milan and FC Barcelona before falling to Manchester United in the quarter finals. A year later, he led the Strasbourg side to victory in the Coupe de France, defeating FC Nantes 1:0. The following season, he was in charge of Karlsruher SC and he remains to this date the only French to ever coach a Bundesliga team. Back at Strasbourg in 1968, he occupied several positions including manager of the first team and director of football until 1976. In 1968 as well, he turned down an offer to be manager of the National Team. He also managed FC Mulhouse in 1974.
Impact on training in France.
Frantz is also renowned for his talents as a coaching trainer and is considered to be one of the iniators of the "scientific approach" to training in France. He was among the first to emphasize physical training and to introduce the use of body-building. During the 1970s he was responsible of the formation organized for aspiring pro managers by the Fédération Française de Football where he taught the likes of Aimé Jacquet, Roger Lemerre and Guy Roux. In Alsace, he also was influential in Arsène Wenger's development as a manager. In 2001, he was the recipient of the ""Trophée Georges Boulogne"" to honour his achievements as an educator and trainer.

Walney Bridge

Walney Bridge (officially Jubilee Bridge) is a bascule bridge in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England. Completed in 1908, it connects the Barrow Island ward on the British mainland to Walney Island spanning Walney Channel. The bridge carries the A590 trunk road, which has its western terminus on Walney.
History.
Talks began in 1897 to how feasible the construction of a bridge connecting Barrow to Walney would be. At the time, Walney residents where frustrated by the fact that they had to use a ferry to traverse the Walney Channel, and they also saw it as an opportunity to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. When the bridge was finally approved many companies fought for the building contract, with Sir William Arrol & Co winning it. Construction of the £175,000 (in that time) bridge began in mid-1905 and was finally opened by Barrow mayor Mrs. T.F. Taylor on 30 July 1908. For 27 years Walney bridge was a toll bridge until 4 April 1935, when the late Queen Mother officially renamed it Jubilee Bridge to mark the silver jubilee of King George V of the United Kingdom, as recorded on a plaque on the bridge, and handed it to the townspeople. During World War II, the bascule bridge was lifted every night to ensure that anyone who made landfall on Walney were unable to reach Barrow by crossing the bridge and reaching its shipbuilding facilities. The bridge is now over 100 years old, and in 2008 Cumbria County Council spent £1 million on renovating the bridge and repainting it for its centenary celebration. The bridge is not to be confused with Abbey Road's Jubilee Bridge, which is also in Barrow and is a Grade II listed structure.
The Blue Bridge.
Walney Jubilee bridge was often nicknamed by local residents "the blue bridge" in relation to its colour and to distinguish it from the other bridge situated on Barrow. These nicknames, however, were ended when in 2008 the bridge was painted gold and black.
Centenary celebrations.
The bridge recently celebrated its 100th anniversary with significant renovation and a night of fireworks.
In fiction.
The bridge was the link to the fictional island of Sodor, home of Thomas the Tank Engine et al. in The Railway Series books by the Reverend W. Awdry

Other members of the first team squad.
Everton were expected to be serious title contenders in the 1892/93 season but a summer of off the field turmoil played a part in a good but not great season. The club were forced to vacate their Anfield Road home and set up at a brand new venue of Goodison Park, leaving behind them their first choice left back, Duncan McLean and forward Alan Wylie. The latter probably realised that the return from injury of Fred Geary would see him left out of the front line but McLean's decision was a surprise to the club and fans and Bob Howarth found himself with six full back partners during the season. For the second year in a row the club struggled to find a first choice keeper as six different custodians filled that role as well, including Joey Murray on three occasions, despite his normal position being as a forward. The indecision in goal was more down to the selectors than poor performance as each defeat the club suffered in the first half of the campaign was met with the keeper being dropped. Eventually the selectors settled for Richard Williams whose regular clean sheets in the latter half of the season saw the club rally to finish the season in third place and reach the cup final.
Everton's midfield trio was also broken up this season as Bob Kelso lost his place to Dickie Boyle who arrived from Dumbarton. The clubs erratic start also saw Hope Robertson replaced eight games in by Jimmy Jamieson. The Scottish left half's stay at Goodison was short and after just four months he left for Sheffield Wednesday.
With Sunderland marching to the title and Everton having to settle for a distant third place, albeit after an excellent run in which saw them win nine of their last ten games it was the F A cup that captured the excitement as the club won through to the final for the first time. The selectors famously fielded a weakened side for the trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers in a league game a week before the two sides met in the cup final and won 4–2. Only four of the that team appeared the following week at the cup final as Boyle and Latta were joined by Kelso, having re-established himself in defence ahead of Collins and Stewart who had taken over after Jamieson had left for Sheffield Wednesday the previous month. The major selection surprise was that Patrick Gordon was selected ahead of Fred Geary in attack. The game became farce when the fans encroached onto the woefully inadequate field at Fallowfield in Manchester and made it impossible for Latta and Milward to use their wing play to proper effect, the latter being physically tripped by a spectator on one occasion. Wolves won the game in the second half when Harry Allen's hopeful punt deceived Dick Williams who lost the ball in the sun. Everton were furious though that Allen had received the ball from a spectator who had kicked the ball of Dickie Boyle's toe as the Everton half was taking the ball away from danger and felt that the game should have been reduced to the level of a friendly with the cup being played for at a later date. The game would leave a bad taste in the mouths of every Evertonian for over a decade until they finally did win the cup in 1906.

The following positive or neutral records were set by the 1891–92 Everton team

United States Marine Corps birthday ball

The United States Marine Corps Birthday is celebrated every year on the 10th of November with a traditional ball and cake-cutting ceremony.
__TOC__
Historical birthday.
The official birthday of the United States Marine Corps, on 10 November 1775, was when the Second Continental Congress decreed:
Tun Tavern, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is regarded as the birthplace of the Corps as the location of the first Marines to enlist under Commandant Samuel Nicholas, though it is disputed if a recruiting drive may have occurred earlier at Nicholas's family tavern, the . When the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, the Continental Navy was disestablished, and with it, the Continental Marines. The Corps was re-established on 11 July 1798, when the ""act for establishing and organizing a Marine Corps"" was signed by President John Adams.
Celebration.
Prior to 1921, Marines celebrated the recreation of the Corps on 11 July with little pomp or pagentry. On 21 October 1921, Major Edwin North McClellan, in charge the Corps's fledgling historical section, sent a memorandum to Commandant John A. Lejeune, suggesting the Marines’ original birthday of 10 November be declared a Marine Corps holiday to be celebrated throughout the Corps. Lejeune so ordered in Marine Corps Order 47:
The first formal ball was celebrated in 1925, though no records exist that indicate the proceedings of that event. Birthday celebrations would take varied forms, most included dances, though some accounts include mock battles, musical performances, pageants, and sporting events.
The celebrations were formalized and standardized by Commandant Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr. in 1952, outlining the cake cutting ceremony, which would enter the Marine Drill Manual in 1956. By tradition, the first slice of cake is given to the oldest Marine present, who in turn hands it off to the youngest Marine present, symbolizing the old and experienced Marines passing their knowledge to the new generation of Marines. The celebration also includes a reading of Marine Corps Order 47, republished every year, as well as a message from the current Commandant, and often includes a banquet and dancing if possible. In many cases, the birthday celebration will also include a pageant of current and historical Marine Corps uniforms, as a reminder of the history of the Corps. Another modern tradition includes a unit run on the 10th. Marines are reputed to celebrate the birthday, regardless of where they may be in the world, even in austere environments or combat.
In a more somber tradition, Samuel Nicholas's grave in the Arch Street Friends Meeting graveyard in Philadelphia is marked with a wreath at dawn by a group of Marines annually on 10 November to celebrate his role in the founding of the Corps.

David Wallin

David August Wallin was born 7 January 1876 in Östra Husby parish in Östergötland County, Sweden and died 27 June 1957 in Stockholm, Sweden, was a Swedish artist. In 1932 he won an Olympic Gold Medal in the art competitions of the Olympic Games in Los Angeles for his oil painting ""At the Seaside of Arild"".
Background.
David Wallin is best known for his oil paintings with genre motifs and idealized images of nude women in atmospheric landscapes, where he stressed the affinity of human and nature. He also painted tender depictions of mother and child, and a series of portraits of famous Swedes and genres as figures, landscapes and nudes, still lifes and religious images. He is represented in a large number of museums.
In 1905 he married the artist Elin Wallin, born Lundberg (1884–1969). He was the brother of the Swedish-American artist Carl E. Wallin (1879–1968), and he was the father of the Swedish artist Bianca Wallin (1909–2006) and the artist Sigurd Wallin (1916–1999).
Biography.
Childhood and Early Years.
David Wallin grew up on a farm, Varby, in Östra Husby parish, a locality on Vikbolandet, which had been in the family since the 17th century. His parents were the carpenter Alexander Wallin and his wife Inga Helena Larsdotter. He grew up in a large household with many siblings, a sister and four brothers. The home was strictly religious, and his father turned to the Bible and the writings of Carl Olof Rosenius for daily guidance. The popular revival movement was a powerful influence on life in the large household with the many children.
Wallin dreamt early of a career as an artist, his first artistic experience was an altarpiece by the artist Pehr Hörberg in Östra Husby church. He worked as a store clerk and as a painter’s apprentice in Norrköping 1893-1896, simultaneously attending lectures at a technical evening college. In 1896 he arrived in Stockholm and found work in the studio/atelier of Carl Grabow, a Swedish decorative painter of theatrical décor. Carl Grabow had established a decorating studio in Kungsholmen in Stockholm. The Grabow Collection at the Drottningholm Theatre Museum is unique documentary material for those wishing to study Swedish scenography of the late 19th century and the first years of the 20th century. Then Wallin continued his studies at the Technical Evening College (Tekniska skolan) in Stockholm under Anders Forsberg, who was a Swedish artist and art teacher and the teacher of freehand drawing at the Technical School.
Royal Academy of Arts in Stockholm 1898-1904.
In 1898 Wallin was admitted at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, where his fellow students included Karl Isakson, Ivar Arosenius and John Bauer. His teacher was among others Georg von Rosen. In 1903-1904 he studied briefly at the École des Beaux-Arts and Académie Colarossi in Paris, where his teacher was the Norwegian naturalist painter, illustrator, author and journalist Christian Krohg.
In 1902 Wallin received the Academy’s Ducal Prize for his oil painting ""Kraka"" and in 1904 he was awarded the Royal Medal for Portrait Painting. ""Kraka"" is a Norse mythology oil painting, of a little girl called Aslög or also called ""Kraka"" or ""Kraka meets Ragnar Lodbrok"" (Hrólf saga kraka, the Saga of King Hrolf kraki). David Wallin’s oil painting of ""Kraka"" has the dimensions of 223 x 149 cm.
Kraka was a Norse princess. She caught the attention of the old king Ragnar Lodbrok thanks to her immense beauty. Before Ragnar took Kraka to his wife he wanted to bring her wisdom to a test. Ragnar invited Kraka to dinner and told her at the same time that she should neither be dressed nor undressed. Kraka survived the challenge by coming dressed in a fishing net. This is the story of the Norse fairy figure Kraka in the Norse mythology. Kraka is also known as the legendary Aslög (Aslaug) in the Norse mythology. She is the daughter of Sigurd and Brynhild Fafnesbane, wife of Ragnar Lodbrok. Aslaug, Aslög, Kraka, Kráka or Randalin, was a queen of Scandinavian mythology who appears in Snorri’s Edda, the Völsunga saga and the saga of Ragnar Lodbrok. Some other Swedish painters, who had earlier painted ""Kraka"", are Mårten Eskil Winge (1825–1896) and August Malmström (1829–1901).
Engagement and marriage in 1905.
David Wallin was engaged in springtime 1905 and in September the same year he married his fellow artist Elin Wallin, born Lundberg (1884–1969). The wedding was on September 14, 1905, in Sankt Nikolai kyrka in Örebro (The Church of Saint Nicolai in Örebro), Elin’s hometown. After the wedding the couple made a combined wedding and study trip to Paris and London during the years 1905-1906. The couple eventually became the parents of seven children, five daughters and two sons, born in 1906 to 1924.
Artistical influences.
Among Wallin’s favorites in Paris were Jean-François Millet, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Gustave Moreau. Jean-François Millet was a French painter and one of the founders of the Barbizon school in rural France. Millet is noted for his scenes of peasant farmers, he can be categorized as part of the naturalism and realism movements. Pierre Puvis de Chavannes was a French painter, who became the president and co-founder of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and whose work influenced many other artists. Gustave Moreau was a French Symbolist painter, a late nineteenth-century art movement of French and Belgian origin, whose main focus was the illustration of biblical and mythological figures. He was the movement's inspirational teacher, and he did much for the era. He was a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he pushed his students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions. Wallin also became acquainted with the works of Édouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and other impressionists artists painting in the style of impressionism, an association of Paris-based artists.
In London Wallin studied the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (also known as the Pre-Raphaelites) and other groups, including James McNeill Whistler, who was an American-born, British-based artist. In London there were major collections of Pre-Raphaelite work in the Tate Gallery (Tate Modern or simply Tate) and Victoria and Albert Museum. Tate is Britain's national gallery of international modern art and forms and V&A is the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design.
David Wallin’s own portrait ""Portrait of my Wife"" was shown at ""Le Salon"", Salon (Paris), at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées on Avenue Alexandre III in Paris. This portrait was a portrait with a sitting model in silvergrey colors which are outlined against dimmed masses of leaves. The avenue Champs-Élysées was located right next to the Palais de l’Élysee (Élysée Palace) and the presidential palace, with its rounded gate, and the Grand Palais, was built in the late 19th century. The ""Grand Palais"" (Big Palace) was a large glass exhibition hall that was built for the Paris Exhibition of 1900. It was located in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.
Early subjects, early important portraits and other motifs.
The subject matter of David Wallin’s earliest independent paintings was associated with his native soil, for instance his ""Family Estate"" (1898). The most important among them, “"The Boy and the Migratory Birds"”. The big painting reveals the influence of the French painter Jean-François Millet, but is clearly inspired by real life.
A number of chiaroscuro portraits (an artistic technique) testify to his infatuation with Rembrandt during his student days at the Academy. "Chiaroscuro" is Italian for “"light-dark"” in art and is characterized by strong contrasts between light and dark, usually bold contrasts affecting a whole composition. It is also a technical term used by artists and art historians for using contrasts of light to achieve a sense of volume in modeling three-dimensional objects such as the human body. Chiaroscuro originated during the Renaissance as drawing on coloured paper, where the artist worked from this base tone towards light, with white gouache, and dark, with ink, bodycolour or watercolour. The French use of the term, "clair-obscur", was introduced in the seventeenth century. In photography, chiaroscuro is often effected with the use of "Rembrandt lighting".
Another motif was that of his wife and the mother-child theme, e.g. ""Spring""(1905), an oil portrait of his wife in the Lill-Jans Forest in Stockholm. Several sketches of his wife show remarkable coloristic free and easy manners. Some charming oils include ""Elin sewing"" (1905), ""Elin against blue sky"" (1905), and ""Elin in sunshine"" (1906).
In 1908, Wallin was awarded an Academy travel fellowship from the Academy’s special fund, which was later extended for another year. The following year, in 1909, he received the Wohlfahrt Award. The scholarship was an award of financial aid for the student to further education. The criteria of the award was that the value and the purpose would further his artistic education. The awards allowed him to live, first in Italy, and then in France during the period 1908-1913, with only brief visits to his native country and to Spain.
Italy 1908-1910.
In Italy, Wallin was based in Rome and Florence during the years 1908-1910 together with his family, his wife and his three daughters at that time. In Rome the family stayed at Via Frattina. Numerous sketches and jottings in his sketchbooks testify to studies of Renaissance painting. His own compositional ideas often consist of vague sketches with one or more figures in a dimly suggested landscape, often romantic couples.
In Rome he painted figures and street-life studies in addition to portraits, including several of ""Mrs. Carin Lidman"", born Thiel, later Mrs. Carin Östberg. In 1919 she married the famous Swedish architect and artist Ragnar Östberg, most famous for designing Stockholm City Hall. Ragnar Östberg was also Professor of Architecture at the Art Academy in Stockholm architecture school from 1922 to 1932. Wallin’s portrait of Mrs. Carin Lidman shows a shimmering young womanhood which is reproduced in richly nuanced, scented colors.
Wallin spent two summers at the Scandinavian Artists’ colony (or Art colony) at Volterra in Tuscany, where he returned to a genre that he had embarked on at home, it was that of nudes in a landscape. His wife and children served as models. The best of these studies suggest the love of light playing on skin and greenery so typical of plein-air painting. Volterra is a small town 45 km southwest of Florence.
Paris 1910-1913.
In 1910 the family moved to Paris at Rue de l’Abbé Grégoire, a street in 6th arrondissement in Paris, where they were friends with, among others, the circle surrounding Erik Tryggelin (1878–1962), a Swedish painter and photographer, and Gottfrid Larsson (1875–1947), a Swedish sculptor. Both of them also studied in Paris with scholarship. In springtime in 1912 Wallin and his wife Elin were the parents of four children, four girls born in 1906, 1907, 1909 and 1912, so it was natural that David’s motifs often were the mother-child theme.
Wallin was first introduced to modern contemporary painting in Paris, where he visited André Lhote and Kees van Dongen. André Lhote, (1885–1962) was a French sculptor and painter of figure subjects, portraits, landscapes and still life. André Lhote was influenced by Gauguin and Cézanne and Cézanne held his first one-man exhibition at the Galerie Druet in 1910. Nevertheless, 19th-century painting remained Wallin's preference. Kees van Dongen (1877–1968), usually known as just Van Dongen, was a Dutch painter and one of the Fauves. Fauvism is the style of "les Fauves" (French for "the wild beasts"), a short-lived and loose group of early twentieth-century modern artists whose works emphasized painterly qualities and strong colour over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism. While Fauvism as a style began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910, the movement as such lasted only a few years, 1904–1908, and had three exhibitions. Kees van Dongen gained a reputation for his sensuous, at times garish, portraits.
Wallin studied modern works at the Gertrude Stein’s modern art gallery in Paris. Much of Gertrude Stein's fame derives from a private modern art gallery she assembled, from 1904 to 1913 when she lived in Paris, with her brother Leo Stein, an art critic. The Steins were important collectors and supporters of Henri Matisse's paintings.
Wallin also studied modern works in the Edmond Auguste Pellerin’s collection of Paul Cézanne’s painting collection and at exhibitions. Wallin exhibited several compositions at "Le Salon (Paris)" in addition to ""Portrait of Elin"", ""Au Soleil"", a nude on the shore, bathed in light, and ""L’air du printemps"", painted in Italy in 1910. Le Salon was the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris. ""By the Wellspring of Life"", too, is characterized by a diffuse setting into which he has introduced the movements of playing children and water. Wallin’s palette is ascetic and suggests the influence of Puvis de Chavannes. Pierre Puvis de Chavannes was a French painter, who became the president and co-founder of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and whose work influenced many other artists. ""In the Beginning"" is reminiscent of Eugène Carrière’s romantic visions of the mother-child bond. Eugène Carrière was a French symbolist artist of the "Fin de siècle" period. Carrière was one of the leaders in the secessionist movement, which led to the founding of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. ""Resting Negro"" was detect the influence of Paul Gauguin’s "The Spirit of the Dead Awakens". Wallin had copied details taken from Paul Cézanne and Paul Gauguin.
Back in Sweden 1913.
"The décor of the wedding room at the Stockholm Court House"
After his return to Sweden in the autumn 1913 Wallin occupied himself with proposals for the décor of the wedding room at the Stockholm Court House (Swedish: Stockholms Rådhus) – a Frieze of Life, now in the Lund University’s Archives for the Decorative Arts in Lund in Sweden (also known as Museum of Sketches for Public Art). Stockholm Court House is situated on Kungsholmen in Central Stockholm, Sweden. The building was constructed between 1909 and 1915. The décoration of the wedding room at the Stockholm Court House had been preceded of three competitions (1912-1914) which had attracted a big number of artists of the time. The fight for the decortation of the wedding room in the new Stockholm Court House became one of the most dramatic in the Swedish history of monumental art. Proposals for the wedding room also came from for instance the artists Isaac Grünewald and Georg Pauli. At last, the decorative paintings in fresco in the wedding room were painted by the artist, master house painter and ornamental painter Filip Månsson, an artist who had earlier carried out décor paintings in the building.
"Other works" 
Wallin also worked on the mother-child theme: portraits of young girls, children, and nudes. Much was a continuation of earlier ideas. His pictures of children are often characterized by a fragile fairy tale atmosphere, such as ""A Little Bud on a Green Meadow"" (1914) and ""Story Time in the Garden"" (1918). The nudes are based on the contrast of light and shadow, movement and rest, ""Spring Holiday"" (1914). In this big painting with the format 168 x 129 cm the artist shows something of his best nude painting. In 1999 the painting was donated to Moderna museet in Stockholm (the Museum of Modern Art, Stockholm).
In 1914 David Wallin participated in the Baltic exhibition (Baltiska utställningen), which was an arts and crafts exhibition held in Malmö in the castle Malmöhus (now Malmö Art Museum) during the period May 15 – October 4, 1914. The Baltic countries of that time, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Russia, were represented in the exhibition. The Swedish architect Ferdinand Boberg was responsible for the shaping of the exhibition.
David Wallin exhibited at the Association of Swedish Artists’ exhibition in Stockholm in 1917 in Liljevalchs konsthall in Stockholm, which was built in 1916. The exhibition devoted a separate room to Wallin’s art. August Brunius was responsible for the most favourable reviews in which he proclaimed Wallin a very special force to be reckoned with within Swedish art, both in terms of his compositions and as the creator of a world of his own.
He has an emotional world of his own which focuses with special intensity on the mother-child theme. We have to go back to the classical painting of old to find a woman of the monumentality of ""A Young Swedish Girl"" or ""Ragnhild"" (created 1914, signed 1916), and to modern Norwegian art to find the equivalent of Wallin’s moving studies of children. The spiritual element sometimes emerges too forcefully, but it never turns cheap or sentimental. The physicality, both of the phenomenon itself and of the painting, is ever present”. (August Brunius in Svenska Dagbladet, May 16, 1917). ""Ragnhild"", 73 x 79 cm, can be counted as a portrait, but it is sooner a composition, where the artist with inspiration and accuracy has brought about a fascinating evening lighting. ""Ragnhild"" was exhibited nine times, both in Sweden and abroad, from 1917 to 1952. In 1998 the painting was donated to the Östergötlands länsmuseum in Linköping (Östergötland County Museum).
""The Salmon Fisherman"" (1915–1919) constitutes an undisputed high point. The mood of nature is here combined with deep, but yet restrained, feeling, filled with grief. Wallin’s preference for running water reminds us that in his youth he was an ardent admirer of Ernst Josephson.
"Two altarpieces and a self-portrait"
Two altarpieces from this period, 1919 and 1920, are in the churches in Valdemarsvik and Bureå. The altarpiece in Valdemarsvik church, in Östergötland, represents ""Christ and the Sinking Peter"" (1919). The other altarpiece, in Bureå church, in Västerbotten, represents ""Jesus Blessing the Children"" (1919–1920). An important self-portrait is also from this period, ""On the Balcony by the Sea"" (composition, signed 1916). The self-portrait, 120 x 90 cm, was donated in 1999 by David Wallin’s heirs to the Art Museum of Norrköping in Östergötland (Norrköpings konstmuseum). The portrait was created during a very active period of the artist’s life, when he was inspired of magnificent nature in harmony with his inner emotionally flows.
The 1920s and 1930s.
In the 1920s Wallin continued on the path of the free composition in which he strove for a synthesis of color and the play of light. His subject matter was usually "nature, mother and child". David Wallin has exhibitied in Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Munich, Dresden, Rome, Venice, Copenhagen, Budapest, Reval, Riga, Turku, Helsinki, Buenos Aires and in several U.S. cities, in Stockholm at Liljevalchs, Baltic Exhibition in Malmö in 1914, solo exhibition in "Nordic Art" at Gothenburg Jubilee Exhibition in 1923 and solo exhibition at Konstakademien (Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm) in 1926. Göteborgs Konsthall was built as an art exhibition hall for the Jubilee Fair of Gothenburg in 1923, Gothenburg Exhibition (1923). Göteborgs Konsthall later became a part of Gothenburg Museum of Art. The museum building, at Götaplatsen in the center of the city, was created for the international exhibition in Gothenburg 1923 celebrating the city’s 300th anniversary. The inaugural exhibition in Göteborgs Konsthall was the Jubilee Exhibition of Nordic contemporary art. The exhibition which took place between May 8 and October 15, 1923, was a muster of the Nordic breakthrough generation of modernism.
Some of the paintings exhibited in David Wallin’s solo Jubilee Exhibition in "Gothenburg 1923" and in Stockholm at "Konstakademien 1926" were:
The big painting ""Summer"" (created 1914, signed 1923), 201 x 157 cm, was exhibited in 1926. The painting represents a standing nude woman, and it pays homage to the woman and it is representative for David Wallin’s nude painting. Then the painting has been exhibited both abroad in Vienna, Budapest, Riga and in Stockholm at his big solo exhibition at Konstakademien 1931 and 1932. In 1998 the painting was also donated to the Östergötlands länsmuseum in Linköping (Östergötland County Museum), and the painting has now been deposit with the castle of Linköping.
At the same time the oil painting ""Springtime in the forest"" (1914–1925), 118 x 94 cm, was also donated to Linköping (Östergötland County Museum). It is a composition with a forest landscape with two figures. An old man is sitting by a tree trunk and a young girl is going with springy steps on the forest road, shows the artist’s typically philosophing presentation of the motif. ""Under the Tree"", was exhibited 1926 and ""Mother and Child"" was also exhibited 1926. ""Mother and Child"" is in the collections of the Budapest art museum in Hungary, Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest) ("in Hungarian": Szépművészeti Múzeum).
In 1926 the paintings ""Arilds fishing village"" ("Arilds läge") and ""Memories of youth"" were purchased by Nationalmuseum in Stockholm (National Museum of Fine Arts in Sweden).
During the 1930s David Wallin continued to devote himself to "nudes", the "relationship between man and nature", and the "bond between mother and child". He painted ""In the Summertime"" (1932), and ""At the Seaside of Arild"" (1932). The latter earned him an Olympic Gold Medal at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in California in the United States of America. ""Father at Ninety"" (1929) represents a rare departure from these themes.
Olympic Gold Medal in Los Angeles in 1932.
David Wallin won the Olympic Gold Medal in painting in Los Angeles, California, United States, in the 1932 Summer Olympics in the United States of America. Art competitions were held as part of 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States. Medals were awarded in five categories (architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture) for works inspired by sport-related themes. David Wallin won an Olympic Gold Medal in the Art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics in painting of the Olympic Games for his oil painting ""At the Seaside of Arild"". The Gold Medal was won in competition with names like Isaac Grünewald and Bruno Liljefors. After the success with the Olympic Gold Medal Wallin was invited over to the United States to do a tour with a touring exhibition. He visited New York, among other places.
Art competitions at the Olympic Games were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948, but were discontinued due to concerns about amateurism and professionalism. Since 1952 a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.
The 1940s and 1950s.
The 1940s and 1950s brought new variations on the theme figure in landscape. He painted ""On my Island in the Archipelago"" (1940), ""Salmon Fishermen in Ådalen"" (1943) and ""Midsummer’s Eve"" (1945). At the same time, he also devoted himself to pure landscape painting such as the pictures of Arild at the foot of Kullaberg in Scania. Arild was a fishing village and seaside resort as well as a resort for artists and writers. The coastline at Arild constitute a special landscape. It is a rocky coast with cobblestone flat rocks and rauk-like rocks. Arild was also an artist colony with famous names such as Gustaf Rydberg, Gustaf Cederström, Fritz von Dardel, Olof Krumlinde, Isaac Grünewald, Nathanael Beskow, Richard Bergh and Herman Österlund and more Skagen Painters, who gathered at Mother Cilla inn. In Kullaberg they were able to take advantage of the particularly strong summer light, reminiscent of that of Skagen. Wallin also made pure landscape painting with pictures of Omberg (Omberg, a mountain in western Östergötland along Vättern’s eastern shore), Scania (Scania in the southernmost of Sweden), Bohuslän (Bohuslän on the west coast of Sweden), Västmanlands bergslag (the western Västmanland traditionally belonged to the mining district of Bergslagen), Norrland (Norrland in the Northland of Sweden) and Norwegian landscapes.
The sketches of David Wallin, which are interesting from a painterly point of view and often exquisite, are part of his long and tireless career as an artist. Several canvases and smaller sketches show immediate coloristic inspiration and a freely poetic color which fuses reality and fantasy. In his landscapes as in his nudes the intense, romantic feeling transforms mountains, rivers, forests and meadows into outpouring of subjective moods.
Portrait Painting.
David Wallin’s portrait gallery contains the features of many leading personalities within Swedish cultural life.
Among the most famous early oil portraits, often chiaroscuro, are the portraits of the artist Axel Fahlkrantz (1851–1925) (1904), the poet and writer Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1904), the university president and architect Viktor Adler (1907), the founder of the telephone company "Telefonaktiebolaget L M Ericsson" Lars Magnus Ericsson and wife, the founder of the color company Wilhelm Becker (1904), Mrs. Granberg (1904), the young girl Barbro Gyllenhammar (1904), Portrait of the Publisher Saxon (1907), and the count and fellow artist, professor at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm Count Georg von Rosen (1908), depicting meditating in front of a painting.
Among the most famous portraits in oil of prominent Swedes later on are Mrs Waldenström (1914), the professor, mathematician Gösta Mittag-Leffler (1920), the author, phonetician, philologist and professor Fredrik Wulff (1922), the professor of literature and cultural history Henrik Schück (1923), the Swedish sculptor Carl Milles (1925), the councilman, director general and politician Bo von Stockenström (1926), the wife of Bo von Stockenström Anna von Stockenström (1926), Countess Magnus Brahe (1927), the professor, philosopher and jurist Axel Hägerström (1929), the doctor and Nobel Laureate Gustaf Dalén (1929), the general and politician Carl Gustaf Hammarskjöld (1930), the lord mayor in Örebro and president at Örebro Savings Bank Victor Schneider (1934), the professor and surgeon Abraham Troell (1938), the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs in the National Unity Government Christian Günther (1939) and the actor and prominent opera singer John Forsell.
Decidedly Romantic, Member of the Intermediate Generation.
David Wallin has often been described as unabashedly romantic. And he could, in fact, arguably be said to be “the last romantic in Sweden”, inasmuch as his approach to life often remained colored by the atmosphere at the turn-of-the-century. He strove to meld the intimate and the monumental in lyrically colored moods – which meant that he gradually distanced himself from modern trends in painting. This approach was deliberate. Wallin never ceased stressing the gap that existed between his own ideals and much of what broke through in today’s art. He wanted to remain faithful to these ideals.
Exhibitions and Memberships.
Wallin had about ten solo exhibitions in Sweden from 1926 to 1953 and about ten Swedish Group Shows in Sweden from 1905 to 1941 and numerous exhibitions sponsored by the Östergötland Art Association in various places in Östergötland. He had about twentyfive exhibitions abroad from 1906 to 1936. Wallin was a member of Swedish Artists’ Association, The Artists’ Club in Stockholm and Union Internationale des Beaux-Arts et des Lettres in Paris.
Represented.
In addition to the Budapest Museum in Hungary, Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest), and the Archives for Decorative Art (The Museum of Sketches) in Lund in the south of Sweden mentioned above, Wallin is also represented in 
In his youth, Wallin sometimes signed his name as Valin, Walin, or Vallin.

On the Bowery

On the Bowery is a 1956 American docufiction film directed by Lionel Rogosin. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.
After the Second World War Lionel Rogosin made a vow to fight fascism and racism wherever he found it. In 1954 he left the family business (Beaunit Mills-American Rayon Corp.) in order to make films in accordance with his ideals. As he needed experience, he looked around for a subject and was struck by the men on the Bowery and decided that this would make a strong film. Thus "On the Bowery" was to be Rogosin's provocative film school that would prepare him for the filming of his anti-apartheid film: "Come Back, Africa" (1960).
In 2008, "On the Bowery" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
Filming.
Greatly influenced by Robert Flaherty and Italian neorealism tradition, Rogosin submerged himself on the Bowery for many months before filming. He got to know the street and the men intimately, befriending a Bowery man: Gorman Hendricks. Together they wandered through the Bowery for several months until Rogosin started filming himself with a hidden camera. Not satisfied with the result he then hired a commercial crew but decided that these attempts were not satisfactory. At this time he was living in New York City’s Greenwich Village and he frequently went to the White Horse Tavern where he met writer Mark Sufrin and cinematographer Dick Bagley (recently part of the crew of Sydney Myers "The Quiet One"). They got along right away and agreed to work with Rogosin. Shooting began with no script or story in July 1955. The first rushes were not working well, so that Rogosin, Sufrin and Bagley worked out a simple script based on the lives of the Bowery men.
In July 1955 Rogosin and his crew started filming. At this time the Third Ave El had ceased running on May 12 but demolition of that section had not yet started so the dark shadows the El cast on the Bowery were still present, adding to the dingy atmosphere. With these Bowery men, Rogosin quickly developed his own method of creating dialogue and improvisation. The filming continued through October 1955 in a grueling schedule of long days and late nights. When the film was finished the first edit with editor Helen Levitt did not meet Rogosin’s approval and he solicited the help of Carl Lerner. Lerner was instrumental in pulling the film together according to Rogosin’s vision, and he acted as a mentill presentor and editor as Rogosin learned this aspect of his craft.
Plot.
The film chronicles three desperate days in a then impoverished lower Manhattan neighborhood, New York's skid row: the Bowery. It is the story of Ray (Ray Salyer), a railroad worker, who drifts on to the Bowery to have a drunken spree after a long bout of laying tracks and then falls in with a band of drunks who help him spend his money. Ray, the "new guy on the Bowery," whose biceps still fill out his sleeves, looks preoccupied as he enters the "Confidence Bar & Grill". Surrounded by various alcoholics in advanced states of decay, he buys them rounds of drinks, then blacks out on his first night, and wakes up to discover that his suitcase has been stolen. The thief (Gorman Hendricks) becomes the closest thing he has to a friend...and just like that, Ray embarks on a trip to hell, becoming part of the Bowery. In a series of Beckettian portraits, the protagonists, congregations of winos, listless listeners, blubber through numerous bar scenes, games of dominos around a flophouse stove, and a sermon at the Bowery Mission. Will Ray find his way out of this uncaring urban jungle?
Reception.
In September 1956, Rogosin became the first American director to win the Best Documentary award at the Venice Film Festival with "On The Bowery". Attacked by Bosley Crowther in the "New York Times" and shunned by the American Ambassador to Italy Clare Boothe Luce at the Venice Festival, Rogosin found support with the Flaherty family and many favorable reviews. In 1957, "On the Bowery" opened at the 55th Street Playhouse in New York, and was nominated for an Academy Award. Despite this success, distribution was extremely difficult. With "On The Bowery", Rogosin became one of the founding fathers in the development of Independent cinema in America, along with Sydney Myers and Morris Engel. "On the Bowery" would become an influence to many future independent filmmakers worldwide.
“..a film made from the inside...In the bars and on the sidewalks, the camera leans sympathetically across table or grating towards these men and women who have passed the point of no return, and have reached a hideous sort of happiness achieved at best by gin and whiskey, and at worst by a shared squeeze from a can of metal polish. We are with these people and we hear what they say. And Rogosin insists that we must love them; he seems to say, with Dostoyevsky, “the sense of their own degradation is as essential to those reckless unbridled natures as the sense of their own generosity.” —Basil Wright, "Sight and Sound"
“...brilliantly revealing photography by Richard Bagley matched to the patient, thoughtful construction and organization of director-producer Lionel Rogosin and writer Mark Sufrin...what stays in your mind permanently, striking you like a hammer when you first see it, is the face of the Bowery...the caked filth, the stubble beard, the clothes of eternity, the physical weakness and the shambling walk, and the unmistakable brand of liquor...” —Arthur Winston, "New York Post"
“...an extraordinary, agonizing document...filled with an overwhelming sense of veracity and an unvoiced compassion for the men who have surrendered their dignity for a drink” —Arthur Knight, "Saturday Review"
“This film, without the pity that secretly insults, without the disgust that indirectly compliments, studies its subjects with honest human interest, tries to see what they see in their lives, tries to find what they find in the bottom of the bottle.” —"Time"
Home media.
Milestone Films released "On the Bowery" on DVD and Blu-ray in 2012.

Moon gazing hare

The moon gazing hare is an ancient symbol of fertility. The hare is always an attribute of lunar deities. The moon-gazing hare was especially important to early Britons. In nature hares can be seen and in ancient times, often seen in this "moon gazing" pose. Chinese moon gazing hares were thought of as gazing up at what he sees as his ancient ancestor, the Moon rabbit in the moon.
The Moon gazing hare and spring.
The hare signifies the fertility of Spring, of new life as the sun returns to the earth. Light and dark are of equal length yet the light is growing stronger.
What the moon gazing hare represents.
The myth of the Moon gazing hare reflects ancient beliefs. Pagans believed that seeing a moon gazing hare would bring growth, rebirth, abundance, new beginnings and good fortune. The hare is known to be sacred to the goddess Eostre and eventually became known as the Easter bunny. In some countries, it is customary to eat hot cross buns around the time of Easter and Christmas; the cross on the bun is said to represent the four quarters of the moon. These buns were originally pagan offerings and were often hung from rafters to scare off evil that lurked in houses.

Energy technology

Energy technology is an interdisciplinary engineering science having to do with the efficient, safe, environmentally friendly and economical extraction, conversion, transportation, storage and use of energy, targeted towards yielding high efficiency whilst skirting side effects on humans, nature and the environment.
For people, energy is an overwhelming need and as a scarce resource it has been an underlying cause of political conflicts and wars. The gathering and use of energy resources can be harmful to local ecosystems and may have global outcomes.
Interdisciplinary fields.
As an interdisciplinary science Energy technology is linked with many interdisciplinary fields in sundry, overlapping ways.
Electrical engineering.
Electric power engineering deals with the production and use of electrical energy, which can entail the study of machines such as generators, electric motors and transformers. Infrastructure involves substations and transformer stations, power lines and electrical cable. Load management and power management over networks have meaningful sway on overall energy efficiency. Electric heating is also widely used and researched.
Thermodynamics.
Thermodynamics deals with the fundamental laws of energy conversion and is drawn from theoretical Physics.
Thermal and chemical energy.
Thermal and chemical energy are intertwined with chemistry and environmental studies. Combustion has to do with burners and chemical engines of all kinds, grates and incinerators along with their energy efficiency, pollution and operational safety.
Exhaust gas purification technology aims to lessen air pollution through sundry mechanical, thermal and chemical cleaning methods. Emission control technology is a field of process and chemical engineering. Boiler technology deals with the design, construction and operation of steam boilers and turbines (also used in nuclear power generation, see below), drawn from applied mechanics and materials engineering.
Energy conversion has to do with internal combustion engines, turbines, pumps, fans and so on, which are used for transportation, mechanical energy and power generation. High thermal and mechanical loads bring about operational safety worries which are dealt with through many branches of applied engineering science.
Nuclear energy.
Nuclear technology deals with nuclear power production from nuclear reactors, along with the processing of nuclear fuel and disposal of radioactive waste, drawing from applied nuclear physics, nuclear chemistry and radiation science.
Nuclear power generation has been politically controversial in many countries for several decades but the electrical energy produced through nuclear fission is of worldwide importance. There are high hopes that fusion technologies will one day replace most fission reactors but this is still a research area of nuclear physics.
Renewable energy.
Renewable energy has many branches.
Wind power.
Wind turbines draw energy from atmospheric currents and are designed using aerodynamics along with knowledge taken from mechanical and electrical engineering.
Geothermal.
Where it can be had, geothermal energy is used for heating and electricity.
Hydropower.
Hydropower draws mechanical energy from rivers, ocean waves and tides. Civil engineering is used to study and build dams, tunnels, waterways and manage coastal resources through hydrology and geology. A low speed water turbine spun by flowing water can power an electrical generator to produce electricity.
Bioenergy.
Bioenergy deals with the gathering, processing and use of biomasses grown in biological manufacturing, agriculture and forestry from which power plants can draw burning fuel. Ethanol, methanol (both controversial) or hydrogen for fuel cells can be had from these technologies and used to generate electricity.
Enabling technologies.
Heat pumps and Thermal energy storage are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or waste heat from a process).
Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to interseasonal, and can involve storage of sensible energy (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or latent energy (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hyropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The Drake Landing Solar Community (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. borehole thermal energy storage allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer. Types of storages for sensible energy include insulated tanks, borehole clusters in substrates ranging from gravel to bedrock, deep aquifers, or shallow lined pits that are insulated on top. Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold between opposing seasons (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a heat pump. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called phase-change materials (PCMs).

SmY RNA

SmY ribonucleic acids (SmY RNAs) are a family of small nuclear RNAs found in some species of nematode worms. They are thought to be involved in mRNA trans-splicing.
SmY RNAs are about 70–90 nucleotides long and share a common secondary structure, with two stem-loops flanking a consensus binding site for Sm protein. Sm protein is a shared component of spliceosomal snRNPs.
SmY RNAs have been found in nematodes of class Chromadorea, which includes the most commonly studied nematodes (such as "Caenorhabditis", "Pristionchus", and "Ascaris"), but not in the more distantly related "Trichinella spiralis" in class Dorylaimia. The number of SmY genes in each species varies, with most "Caenorhabditis" and "Pristionchus" species having 10–26 related paralogous copies, while other nematodes have 1–5.
Discovery.
The first SmY RNA was discovered in 1996 in purified "Ascaris lumbricoides" spliceosome preparations, as was another called SmX RNA that is not detectably homologous to SmY. Twelve SmY homologs were identified computationally in "Caenorhabditis elegans", and ten in "Caenorhabditis briggsae". Several transcripts from these SmY genes were cloned and sequenced in a systematic survey of small non-coding RNA transcripts in "C. elegans".
A systematic survey of 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) 5' capped transcripts in "C.elegans" using anti TMG antibodies identified two TMG capped SmY transcripts. Sequence analysis of the potential Sm binding sites in these transcripts indicated the SmY, U5 snRNA, U3 snoRNA and the spliced leader RNAs transcripts (SL1 and SL2) all contain a very similar consensus SM binding sequence ( AAU4–5GGA). The predicted SM binding sites identified in the U1, U2 and U4 snRNA transcripts varied from this consensus. 
Function.
In "C. elegans", SmY RNAs copurify with spliceosome and with Sm, SL75p, and SL26p proteins, while the better-characterized "C. elegans" SL1 trans-splicing snRNA copurifies in a complex with Sm, SL75p, and SL21p (a paralog of SL26p). Loss of function of either SL21p or SL26p individually causes only a weak cold-sensitive phenotype, whereas knockdown of both is lethal, as is a SL75p knockdown. Based on these results, the SmY RNAs are believed to have a function in trans-splicing.

Kyle Legault

Kyle Patrick Legault (born 30 May 1985 in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian speedway rider.
Career.
Legault is a three-time Canadian individual speedway champion; winning in 2003, 2004 and 2006. He began his British speedway career in 2005, with Premier League team the Sheffield Tigers where he recorded a 5.80 average in his first season. Legault remained with Sheffield in 2006 and the team reached the Premier League play-off final and the final of the Premier Trophy, but lost both finals to the King's Lynn Stars.
Legault switched to the Mildenhall Fen Tigers for 2007 and recorded an improved average of 8.77 by the end of the season. He also reached the final round of the 2008 Speedway Grand Prix qualifiers at Vojens, Denmark, but fell during his first heat and fractured his right wrist. In 2008, Legault moved to the Birmingham Brummies. However, in only Birmingham's second meeting of the season he was involved in a crash and suffered a broken fibula. It was thought that Legault would miss the remainder of the season, but he returned 12 weeks later to take part in a 2009 Speedway Grand Prix qualification round. He resumed racing for Birmingham in July, but broke his jaw and was ruled out for the rest of the season after he was involved in a crash at Sheffield on 21 August. 
Legault moved up to the Elite League in 2009 after signing a one-year loan deal with 2008 champions the Poole Pirates. However, at the beginning of the season, Legault suffered complications with the fibula he broke in 2008 and was required to undergo further surgery. Poole signed Paul Hurry as a temporary replacement but Legault missed the entire 2009 season. In 2010, Legault moved to Newport Wasps following recovery from injury.

Arran Gare

Arran Gare is an Australian philosopher known mainly for his work in environmental philosophy, philosophy of science, philosophy of culture and the metaphysics of process philosophy. He currently holds the position of Associate Professor in the Faculty of Life and Social Sciences at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
Biography.
Gare is the son of Frank Gare ISO, former Commissioner for Native Welfare and Regional Director of Aboriginal Affairs in Western Australia, and Nene Gare, author of "The Fringe Dwellers" and other novels. He is also the brother of Shelley Gare, an Australian author and journalist.
Gare graduated from the University of Western Australia with a BA (Hons) in philosophy. He then wrote his PhD, ("Science, Process Philosophy and the Image of Man: the metaphysical foundations for a critical social science"), at Murdoch University in which he formed his version of process metaphysics. On the basis of this he won a Postdoctoral Fulbright Fellowship to Boston University. Gare has taught at Murdoch University, University of Queensland, Curtin University and Swinburne University. In 2006 he was a Keynote Speaker to the 6th International Whitehead Conference at Salzburg University, Austria, delivering a paper entitled: "Reviving the Radical Enlightenment". More recently he has aligned himself with Chinese environmentalists in the quest to create a global ecological civilization.
Research.
Gare's work is mainly in environmental philosophy, the history and philosophy of science, philosophy of culture and the metaphysics of process philosophy. In 1983 with Robert Elliot he published Environmental Philosophy, one of the first anthologies in this field. In 1993 he published Nihilism Incorporated: European Civilization and Environmental Destruction and Beyond European Civilization: Marxism, Process Philosophy and the Environment, and then in 1995 he published Postmodernism and the Environmental Crisis. In these works he attempted to explain the ascendance, world domination and environmental destructiveness of European civilization, the failure of orthodox Marxism as practiced in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to provide a real alternative to this, and the ineffectuality of deconstructive postmodernism in the face of the ecological crisis confronting humanity, while offering a different path into the future based on a synthesis of process metaphysics, neo-Aristotelian ethics, neo-Hegelian political philosophy and eco-Marxism. In 1996 he published Nihilism Inc.: Environmental Destruction and the Metaphysics of Sustainability. He has continued to develop the ideas expounded in these books in a range of journals, book chapters, conferences and conference proceedings. 
In more recent work Gare has published in the fields of narratology, hermeneutics, semiotics, complexity theory, theoretical biology, human ecology and philosophical anthropology, Schelling’s philosophy, Chinese philosophy and Christopher Alexander’s theories of architecture, and called for a revival of the Radical Enlightenment as the true heir of the Renaissance struggle for democracy and for the creation of an ecological civilization as a new world order based on a new relationship between humanity and nature. More specifically, he has been concerned to develop more adequate theoretical foundations for human ecology and ecological economics to provide an alternative to neo-classical economics as the core discipline for formulating public policy, and has been developing a form of retrospective path analysis as an alternative to cost-benefit analysis as a framework for formulating such policy.
A critical review of his work has been made from within the domain of process philosophy by McLaren.
Foundation of a Journal.
He is the founder and a chief editor of the online journal "Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy" (ISSN: 1832-9101) which is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal of natural and social philosophy. Quoting the journal: "It serves those who see philosophy's vocation in questioning and challenging prevailing assumptions about ourselves and our place in the world, developing new ways of thinking about physical existence, life, humanity and society, so helping to create the future insofar as thought affects the issue. Philosophy so conceived is not exclusively identified with the work of professional philosophers, and the journal welcomes contributions from philosophically oriented thinkers from all disciplines."

J. R. Williams

James Robert Williams (March 30, 1888, Nova Scotia, Canada – June 17, 1957) was a cartoonist who signed his work J. R. Williams. He was best known for his long-run daily syndicated panel, "Out Our Way". As noted by Coulton Waugh in his 1947 book, "The Comics", anecdotal evidence indicated that more Williams' cartoons were clipped and saved than were other newspaper comics. A newspaper promotion of 1930 compared him to poets Eugene Field and James Whitcomb Riley.
When he was young, Williams' family moved to Detroit, and he was 15 when he dropped out of school to work as an apprentice machinist in Ohio, soon relocating to Arkansas and Oklahoma, where he drifted about, sometimes working on ranches during a six-year period. He spent three years in the U.S. Cavalry.
Returning to Ohio, he married Lida Keith and settled into a steady job with a crane manufacturing firm where he drew covers for the company's catalog. During his spare time, he created cartoons depicting ranch life and machine shop workers. He started submitting his work to newspaper syndicates, eventually receiving an offer from NEA.
"Out Our Way" begins.
"Out Our Way" first appeared in newspapers on March 20, 1922. The single-panel series introduced a variety of characters, including the cowboy Curly and ranch bookkeeper Wes, and soon led to a Sunday strip, "Out Our Way with the Willits". His assistants on the strip were George Scarbo and Neg Cochran. 
Williams used "Out Our Way" as an umbrella title for several alternating series. These had recurring characters, such as "Bull of the Woods" about the boss of a machine shop and the small town family life in "Why Mothers Get Gray". Don Markstein, in describing Williams' settings and themes, lists the other series subtitles:
With 40 million readers by 1930, Williams was so successful that he bought his own ranch in Prescott, Arizona, where he rode about on his horse Lizard. He later moved to Pasadena, California. His cartoons and strips continued through the next two decades, appearing in more than 700 newspapers at their peak. They were collected in several books, and some were reprinted in "Popular Comics". In 1956, the Worry Wart starred in a single issue of his own comic book, a Dell Four-Color titled, "Out Our Way with the Worry Wart". The following year, Williams died at age 69.
"Out Our Way" was continued by Neg Cochran, Paul Gringle, Ed Sullivan and others until 1977.
Publisher Leonard G. Lee of Canada's Algrove Publishing has reprinted Williams' work in more than a dozen volumes of their Classic Reprint Series. In addition to "Out Our Way Sampler: 20s, 30s & 40s" (2005), their catalog includes "U.S. Cavalry Cartoons", "The Bull of the Woods" (six volumes) and "Classic Cowboy Cartoons" (four volumes).

George Washington (Greenough)

George Washington (1840) is a massive sculpture by Horatio Greenough commissioned for the centennial of U.S President George Washington's birth in February 22, 1732.
Description.
Horatio Greenough based “Enthroned Washington” on Phidias' great statue of "Zeus Olympios" which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (and which was destroyed in late Antiquity).
The seated and sandal wearing Washington gazes sternly ahead. He is bare-chested and his right arm and hand gesture with upraised index finger toward heaven. His left palm and forearm cradle a sheathed sword, hilt forward, symbolizing Washington turning over power to the people at the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War.
The rear base of the statue has an inscription, as follows:
SIMULACRUM ISTUD <br>
AD MAGNUM LIBERTATIS EXEMPLUM<br>
NEC SINE IPSA DURATURUM<br>
HORATIUS GREENOUGH<br>
FACIEBAT"
The translation is: "Horatio Greenough made this image as a great example of freedom, and will not survive without freedom itself."
History.
The U.S. Congress commissioned Greenough to create a statue of Washington for display in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. 
When the marble statue arrived in Washington, DC in 1841, however, it immediately generated controversy and criticism. 
Many found the sight of a half-naked Washington offensive, even comical. 
The statue was relocated to the east lawn of the Capitol in 1843. 
Disapproval continued and some joked that Washington was desperately reaching for his clothes, then on exhibit at the Patent Office several blocks to the north. In 1908, the statue was brought back indoors when Congress transferred it to the Smithsonian Castle, where it remained until 1964. It was then moved to the new Museum of History and Technology (now the National Museum of American History). The marble statue has been exhibited on the second floor of the museum since that time.
Popular culture references.
The demigod-like pose of Washington is portrayed in Dan Brown's best-selling novel "The Lost Symbol" (2009), in which the author describes a hypothesis according to which Washington and the other founding fathers decorated the national capital full of Freemason and other occult symbols. However, the pose was only associated with Freemasonry after the Taxil Hoax, which falsely linked Freemasonry to Satan worship. The Taxil Hoax was perpetrated in the 1890s, while the statue was made in 1840.
The statue appears near the beginning of the 2013 first person shooter, "Bioshock Infinite", set in an alternate 1912 where Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson are worshiped by the inhabitants of the floating city of Columbia.

Mordechai Dov Brody

Mordechai Dov Brody (nicknamed Motl or Motyl) (1996 – 2008) was a 12-year-old Hasidic Jewish boy from Brooklyn, New York, United States. After a brain tumor stopped his brain functioning, doctors declared him legally dead on November 4, 2008, but his parents refused to accept the legal definition of death on religious grounds because his heart was still beating. The case became the center of a widely publicized, but never resolved, legal dispute between his parents, Eluzer and Miriam Brody, and Children's National Medical Center, Washington, D.C.
Position of the hospital.
According to an affidavit filed by one of his doctors, Motl's condition had deteriorated beyond a persistent vegetative state. He was pronounced brain dead and was unable to breathe on his own without the help of a ventilator. His heart beat on its own, but he required medication to maintain his blood pressure (normally a function of the brain stem). As a result, Brody's physicians wished to remove the boy from life support, as they believed he was brain dead, which is the legal definition of death in the District of Columbia.
Position of the parents.
Although there is no consensus about what defines death in Jewish law, the parents are followers of rabbi Chaim Jacob Tauber, chief rabbinical judge of the Bobov Hasidic community in Brooklyn and they reject brain death as an indicator of death. They wanted their son to remain on a ventilator as long as his heart was beating. As the case deals with the definition of death, rather than the value of living in a permanent vegetative state, it was far more like that of Jesse Koochin than that of Terri Schiavo.
Legal proceedings.
The hospital asked Judge William Jackson of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to affirm the doctors' decision that the boy could be taken off life support. Motl's parents challenged the hospital's assertion that Motl was dead, and claimed that doing so would be a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The judge heard initial arguments on November 10, but delayed issuing a decision until further hearings could be held. The family and the hospital also released a joint statement where they expressed their mutual hope for an out of court decision.
Cardiac death.
Motl's heart stopped on November 15, 2008, and he was buried on November 16. The court case was never resolved and, with Motl's death, is unlikely ever to be.

Leonard Bates

Leonard Thomas Ashton Bates (20 March 1895 – 11 March 1971) was an English cricketer. He was a right-hand batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler who played for Warwickshire.
Born in the pavilion at Edgbaston Cricket Ground where his father, John, was head groundsman, Bates would go on play 200 first-class matches at the ground scoring over 8,000 runs. In total Bates represented his county 441 times between 1913 and 1935, he also made two appearances for 'The Rest' against England in 1927 and once for the Players against Gentlemen in 1925.
Bates scored a total of 19,380 first-class runs at an average of 27.84, passing 1,000 runs in a season 12 times and three times passing 1,500. He scored 21 centuries, two coming against Kent at Coventry in 1927, his highest was a score of 211 against Gloucestershire in 1932.
After retiring as a player in 1935 he fulfilled the role of coach and head groundsman at Christ's Hospital until 1963. He died at Coldwaltham following a long and debilitating illness in which both his legs were amputated.

Toussaint-Henry-Joseph Fafchamps

Toussaint-Henry-Joseph Fafchamps, sometimes spelled Fafschamps, was a Belgian Army Captain. In 1851, with the Belgian gunsmith Joseph Montigny and the Fusnot company, he developed what is sometimes considered the first machine gun in history, 10 years before the advent of the Gatling gun. 
Specifications.
Fafchamps made a prototype of his machine, as well as drawings, which were remitted to Montigny. The Fafschamps gun was a manually fired 50-barrels volley gun using needle fire and paper cartridges, and was only intended as a stationary artillery piece for defensive fortifications. Fafchamps named it the "carabine multiple".
Legacy.
Joseph Montigny further improved the weapon, completing the transportable 37-barrels Montigny mitrailleuse (also known as the "Fafschamps-Montigny mitrailleuse") in 1863. From 1859, Joseph Montigny proposed his design to Napoleon III, which led to the development of the French Reffye mitrailleuse, designed by Jean-Baptiste Verchère de Reffye with the collaboration of Montigny, and which was adopted by the French Army in 1865. The invention of Fafschamps thus became the basis of the "mitrailleuse", which was used by the French in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Initially kept under wraps as a secret weapon, it became widely used in battle by French artillery during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71).

2008 Libyan Al-Fatih Cup Final

The 2007–08 Libyan Cup final was an football match held at 11 June Stadium on July 26, 2008. The match was contested by Khaleej Sirte and Al Madina. This was the first time in ten years that one of the Big Two of Libyan football, Al Ahly Tripoli and Al Ittihad, were not in the final. The match was a tense affair as this was Khaleej Sirte's first final, and as Al Madina had lost their last two, and their last cup win was in 1978, both sides, with similar league finishes, cancelled each other out. Khaleej Sirte won the game, with an 81st minute goal from Idrees Salem, and thus, secured qualification for the 2009 CAF Confederation Cup and the 2008 Libyan Super Cup. This trophy was Sirte's first major honour.

Odlum Brown Vancouver Open

The Odlum Brown Vancouver Open is a professional tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts. It is currently part of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Challenger Tour, and of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) Women's Circuit. It is held annually at the Hollyburn Country Club in Vancouver, Canada, since 2002.
History.
The inaugural Odlum Brown Vancouver Open took place in the Summer of 2002, in the Jericho Tennis Club, before it eventually moved to the Hollyburn Country Club, in West Vancouver, for the 2005 edition. Started as a $25,000 ITF Women's Circuit event, the Van Open saw the victory of eventual World No. 1 Maria Sharapova over Laura Granville in 2002, and of then-Junior World No. 1 and French Open girls' singles champion Anna-Lena Grönefeld in 2003.
The following year, Tennis Canada and Tennis BC (tennis' governing body in British Columbia) joined to bring the event to the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Tour as a $110,000 Tier V event. Czech qualifier, and eventual top ten member Nicole Vaidišová won the singles final over 2002 runner-up Laura Granville, becoming, as World No. 180, the lowest-ranked player to win a tour title during the 2004 WTA Tour season, and at 15 years, 3 months, and 23 days, the sixth youngest player to win a professional title in tour history.
While the women's event returned to its $25,000 ITF Circuit format in 2005, "to help develop some of the world's best Canadian junior girls", a $100,000 men's Challenger event was added to the tournament, with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) and the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Tour joining Tennis Canada, Tennis BC and the ITF in the organisation of the Open. Israeli Dudi Sela won the inaugural men's singles event over Australian Paul Baccanello in straight sets, and American Ansley Cargill won the first of her two women's singles titles (2005, 2006).
The Vancouver Open continued to grow in the following editions, with the ITF event's prize money moving up to $50,000 in 2007, and $75,000 in 2009. Amongst the tournament's champions since 2005 have been, on the women's side, former Junior World No. 1 Urszula Radwańska (2008 singles), Stéphanie Dubois (2007 doubles, 2009 singles), and on the men's side Rik de Voest (2006 singles, 2007 and 2009 doubles), Frédéric Niemeyer (2007 singles), Dudi Sela (2005, 2008 and 2010 singles), who claimed his second Van Open title, and 2006 Australian Open runner-up Marcos Baghdatis (2009 singles), who won in Vancouver his first title since February 2007. 
The Vancouver Open is run by Tournament Chairman Floyd Hill, Tournament Director Ryan Clark and Chief of Officials Lois Ker.

<doc id="20123121" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20123121" title="French kiss">
French kiss

In English informal speech, French kiss refers to an amorous kiss in which the participants' tongues extend to touch the other participant's lips or tongue. The implication is of a slow, passionate kiss which is considered intimate, romantic, erotic or sexual.
A "kiss with the tongue" stimulates the partner's lips, tongue and mouth, which are sensitive to the touch. The practice is usually considered a source of pleasure. The oral zone is one of the principal erogenous zones of the body.
Anthropologists are divided into two schools on the origins of kissing, one believing that it is instinctual and intuitive and the other that it evolved from what is known as "kiss feeding", a process used by mothers to feed their infants by passing chewed food to their babies' mouths.
Etymology.
A French kiss is so-called because at the beginning of the 20th century, the French had a reputation for more adventurous and passionate sex practices. In France, it is referred to as "un baiser amoureux" ("a lover's kiss") or "un baiser avec la langue" ("a kiss with the tongue"), even if in past times it was also known as "baiser florentin" ("Florentine kiss"). The Petit Robert 2014 French dictionary, released on May 30, 2013, added the French verb "galocher" — to kiss with tongues — making it the first time a single word described the practice.
Biology.
According to the biologist Thierry Lodé, tongue kisses, including the exchange of saliva, allows lovers to explore the immune system in order to avoid other people who have too much genetic relatedness. Indeed, from an evolutionary point of view, the sexual partner should be different to be attractive and to provide the genetic diversity that promote the health of the immune system progeniture. The Smell Identification salivary amended by the immune system can trigger desire, love, consent and finally the sexual act itself.

Kathlamet people

The Kathlamet people are a tribe of Native American people with a historic homeland along the Columbia River in what is today southwestern Washington state. The Kathlamet people originally spoke the Kathlamet language, a dialect of the Chinookan language. They were also called "Guasámas, or Guithlamethl, by the Clackamas", and "Kwillu'chini, by the Chinook."
Lewis and Clark reported "that about 300 Cathlamet occupied nine plank houses on the south side of the Columbia River", and lived between Tongue Point and Puget Island in Clatsop County, Oregon. On the north side, they lived "from the mouth of Grays Bay to a little east of Oak Point." Their villages were:
Clark wrote:
November 11th Monday 1805<br>
About 12 o'clock 5 Indians came down in a canoe, the wind very high from the S.W., with most tremendous waves breaking with great violence against the shores. Rain falling in torrents, we are all wet as usual and our situation is truly a disagreeable one. We purchased of the Indians 13 red char which we found to be an excellent fish. We have seen those Indians above and are of a nation who reside above and on the opposite side who call themselves (Calt-har-ma). They are badly clad & ill made, small and speak a language much resembling the last nation. One of those men had on a sailor's jacket and pantaloons and made signs that he got those clothes from the white people who lived below the point &c. Those people left us and crossed the river (which is about 5 miles wide at this place) through the highest waves I ever saw a small vessels ride. Those Indians are certainly the best canoe navigators I ever saw.
"In early January 1806 Cathlamet Chief Shahharwarcap, together with 11 men, visited Fort Clatsop". "About 1810 the Cathlamets moved across the Columbia and joined the Wahkiakums in a village at the present site of Cathlamet." About 50-60 Cathlamet remained in 1849.
"The last speakers of Kathlamet died in the 1930's," and the tribe is no longer distinct from the Chinook people.
Queen Sally's Spring in Cathlamet, Washington is named after the former head of the Kathlamet people, who told stories about her memories of Lewis and Clark as a young girl.

<doc id="20123165" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20123165" title="Kenyon Athletic Center">
Kenyon Athletic Center

The Kenyon Athletic Center (KAC) is an athletic center and student union serving the Kenyon College and Gambier village communities in Ohio. It was designed by architect Graham Gund and opened to the public on 25 January 2006. The facility cost approximately $70 million to build.
Planning and construction.
Plans were begun in 2001 for an athletic center to replace the then-outdated Ernst Center and Wertheimer Fieldhouse that had previously served Kenyon College. The building was originally intended to be called the Fitness, Recreation, and Athletic facility (FRA). Designs were made in collaboration with coaches and other athletics personnel, such as swimming coach Jim Steen, who was consulted while making designs for the "state-of-the-art" natatorium.
The KAC was built on the south end of Kenyon's campus, over the site of the former Wertheimer Fieldhouse, which was demolished to make way for the new facility. Construction began in 2003 and the facility was first opened to the public on 25 January 2006, two semesters after the originally projected date of completion (May 2005) and almost three years after the beginning of construction.
Architecture and features.
The athletic center consists of a hangar-like structure approximately long and wide, or in total, with an arching roof supported by concrete columns in the center of the building and along the perimeter. A frequently noted feature of the building is the use of glass to create an "open" feel and provide natural lighting—most of the outer wall is made of baffled glass panels. There is also integratedness between the different areas of the facility: most interior walls do not reach the ceiling, making it possible to see and hear activities in other parts of the building.
A key feature of the building is its natatorium, which serves as the principal training for the "Lords" and "Ladies" Kenyon swimming teams; the Lords have won 31 consecutive NCAA Division III championships, making them the team with the most NCAA titles in any sport, and the Ladies have won 23 (nonconsecutive) titles. The natatorium includes an olympic-size swimming pool with a "state-of-the-art regenerative media filter" (which, it has been claimed, saves 600,000 gallons of water a year), and is climate-controlled and hermetically sealed off from the rest of the facility.
The glass walls of the facility also play an important role in heating and regulating the temperature of the building: the glass panels have reflective coatings that control the entry of heat into the building, and are made up of two panes separated by a pocket of air which, along with the air between the glass panels and the interior sound baffling, are meant to help insulate the building and preserve energy. According to Calvin Frost, chairman of the Channeled Resources Group, Kenyon students placed a high value on ecological friendliness when sharing their attitudes about the KAC.
In addition to its natatorium, the KAC includes a 200-meter indoor track, tennis courts, and a basketball arena. As one of the primary goals of the building's design was to cater to recreational users and the student community in addition to varsity athletes, it also includes a weight and fitness room, a multi-purpose athletic court for intramural sports and community use, squash courts, dance studios, conference rooms, a movie theater, and a small café.
Recognition.
The facility has been widely praised for its architectural design, and has won several awards. It won the 2007 Facilities of Merit award from "Athletic Business" magazine, the New England AIA Merit Award for Design Excellence, and the Boston Society of Architects Honor Award, and was nominated for the 2007 Court of the Year award from the American Sports Builders Association. On the other hand, it has also received some criticism for its high cost.
Use in 2007 Will Graham celebration.
From 5 to 7 October 2007, the KAC was rented out to Will Graham of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association for the 2007 Will Graham Celebration, which was attended by approximately 5,000 people. The event was met with some controversy among the mostly liberal–progressive Kenyon College community, as Graham's son Franklin Graham had been accused of making discriminatory anti-Islamic statements; numerous students and faculty called the choice to host the event "inappropriate" and criticized Kenyon's administration for having allowed it.
Several weeks before the Celebration, about 300 residents of Knox County, Ohio, in which Kenyon is located, gathered near the Kenyon Athletic Center for a "Surround the KAC" event to "form a shield of protection" around the property in preparation for the Celebration. The event was also intended as an outreach to the non-Christian community. In order to avoid trespassing on college property, the group used the public roads around the athletic facility to surround and "bath the building in prayer".

2009 Asian Martial Arts Games

The 1st Asian Martial Arts Games were held in Bangkok, Thailand from August 1, 2009 to August 9, 2009 in 9 sports. Due to Political crisis in Thailand And 2009 Swine Flu, the Bangkok Asian Martial Arts Games Organizing Committee (BAMAGOC) and the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Thailand decided that Asian Martial Arts Games moved from the original schedule of April 25 to May 3 now on August 1 - 9.
Emblem.
The emblem comprises the letter "A" which stands for Asia that would include the Asian countries and population as well; while the letter "M" stands for Martial Arts Sports. The two connected letters are reflecting the meanings of modernity, activeness and simplicity; combining with the thoughts and cohesiveness of friendship and equality among the countries in Asia for the upcoming Martial Arts Games.
For the overall picture, it is a mixture of contemporary art, manifesting that Thailand is to act as the host of the Games. Red is the main color of the OCA, reflecting the color of the fight, standing for the color of the heart and colorizing the Asian art. Gold is the color of brightness of the Thai Kingdom and is the color for creativity and determination to organize the 1st Asian Martial Arts Games 2009.
Mascot.
“Hanuman” is a white – creamy super monkey and considers it as the God of the ape which has every kind of fighting skill with strong determination of great success.
The Organizing Committee uses “Hanuman Yindee” as the Mascot as it wants to convey the message of the word “Yindee” which means proudness and gratification. Furthermore, the Organizing Committee is using the word “Yindee” as to extend to everybody a warm welcome and a chance of making continuous friendship and solidarity throughout the entire peoples of Asia.
Participating nations.
37 out of the 45 Asian countries took part. Iran, North Korea, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Timor-Leste did not compete. Iran, a favourite for a spot at the top of the leader board pulled out of the contest after fears of catching swine flu forced the Iranian National Olympic Committee to advise the country pull out of the contest. Palestine, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan did not have any competitors at the games but their athletes still counted in the draw in Taekwondo because of their late withdrawal.

Pat Lykos

Patricia R. "Pat" Lykos (born February 20, 1942) is an American lawyer who is the former District Attorney of Harris County, Texas, United States. She defeated Democrat Brad Bradford in the general election on November 4, 2008. She survived the March 2008 primary, coming in second and receiving enough votes to qualify for the April 2008 runoff election. In the April 8, 2008 runoff, she defeated prosecutor Kelly Siegler 52.6% to 47.3%. The Harris County District Attorney position became open after the former DA Chuck Rosenthal resigned in response to scandal that happened after racial and sexist messages and jokes were found on county computers, under Rosenthal's control.
Biography.
Lykos, a graduate of the University of Houston and South Texas College of Law, was employed as a Houston police officer, and then started her own private practice as a litigator. In 1980, the Harris County Commissioners' Court appointed her to the newly created bench of County Criminal Court No. 10, and she won election that year.
In 1981, Republican Governor Bill Clements appointed her as Judge of the 180th State Criminal District Court. Lykos ran for re-election to the criminal court for three terms, in 1982, 1986 and 1990 being re-elected each time. Lykos has served as a senior district judge, a special assignments judge, and as Director of Special Projects for County Judge Robert Eckels, and Director of Judicial and Legal Issues for County Judge Ed Emmett.
She was the former chief judge of the Harris County criminal district courts, served three terms as President of the Retired, Senior and Former Judges of Texas, and taught in programs for the Texas Center for the Judiciary, the American Bar Association, and the State Bar of Texas. She is a Fellow of the American Bar Foundation and the Houston Bar Foundation, of which she is a founding member. She has been an adjunct professor at South Texas College of Law, and taught at the National Judicial College. 
Lykos has appeared on television news programs such as "Nightline", "48 Hours" and "Crime in America".
Tenure as the Harris County District Attorney.
Pat Lykos put together a leadership team with extensive management and criminal justice system experience. This team, with a total of over 150 years of legal experience, was vital to restoring public trust and confidence in the Harris County District Attorney’s Office after the Rosenthal scandal exposed an undercurrent of racism and negligence at the office. Lykos and her administration quickly worked to build the office into the best in the nation.
Lykos immediately adopted a new policy that all offense reports and related information must be provided to the defense to offer an efficient and equitable system. Prior to the initiation of this policy, defense lawyers were only allowed to view the reports and take non-verbatim notes. Within the first 100 days, the District Attorney’s Office developed a computer database to streamline the restitution requests and payments.
In January 2009, Lykos strengthened the already existing Mental Health Section, which works towards a community-based partnership that provides assistance for qualified, non-violent defendants with serious mental disabilities. The warehousing of persons with mental health issues who have committed non-violent nuisance offenses presents public safety, public health, and humanitarian issues. From January 2009 to June 2012, 98 offenders have entered into mental health diversion contracts and the recidivist rate is 15.67%. It is estimated that this program has saved Harris County about two million dollars; but, the vital statistic is the number of people who are in treatment and not confined to meaningless and indefinite incarceration.
In March 2009, Lykos worked with the Harris County Juvenile Probation Department to develop a diversion from the criminal justice system for non-violent juvenile offenders charged with first offenses that did not involve violence, drugs, or weapons. As of December 2012, 5,896 juveniles have successfully completed the program and only 11% of the participating offenders have re-offended.
In August 2009, Lykos established the DIVERT (Direct Intervention Using Voluntary Education, Restitution, and Treatment) program (which is outside of the State Law's range of punishment)to reduce the number of repeat offenders involved in impaired driving situations. Eligibility was established to meet public safety, public confidence consideration, and evidence-based practices criteria. Only true first offenders are considered and those eligible enter into a contract and are placed in treatment under strict conditions and supervision. As of December 2012, 3,134 defendants have successfully completed the program and only 99 have committed a new offense, which is a recidivism rate of 1.86%(please note that the program has not exceeded the time appropriate for an actual recividism study).
In 2009, Lykos created the Child Exploitation Section, (formerly known as Child Abuse Division) which led to the first charges for using the Sony PlayStation internet portal to attempt to solicit an eleven-year-old girl. She also created a Cold Case/Fugitive Apprehension Section that was dedicated to capturing fugitives. Prior to 2009, the sex offender registries from the Houston Police Department and the Harris County Sheriff’s Department were separated. Lykos immediately worked to consolidate these registries, thereby providing all local law enforcement with the same information.
In 2010, Pat Lykos received the Honesty and Integrity in Prosecution award from the Innocence Project of Texas. Lykos believes that all credible claims of innocence must be investigated because convicting innocent people is a triple tragedy: sends the wrong person to prison, denies real justice to victims, and leaves the actual criminal free to strike again.
In 2010, Lykos executed a temporary injunction to bar known criminal street gang members from Haverstock Hills, one of the most dangerous apartment complexes in Harris County, following after numerous other counties in the state. Now, the most dangerous apartment community is safe.
Beginning in January 2009, Lykos commenced a review of policies and procedures to ensure that the office was complying with applicable statutory and caselaw in observance of the mandate to see that justice is done. One of the issues raised related to whether there should be a minimum measurable amount of controlled substance as a requisite to filing charges. A determination was made, after consultation with scientific academies and forensic laboratories, that the minimum threshold amount of the Penalty Group One and Two should be .01 (one/one hundredth of a gram). This policy has eliminated the dangerously overcrowded conditions involved in the daily moving of inmates between the jail and the courthouse. And while this is not the responsibility of the District Attorney, Lykos narrowly focused on it. The reduction in the jail population is saving Harris County millions of dollars in overtime pay and the cost of transporting and housing inmates in Louisiana and other jurisdictions. Now, more officers are on patrol rather than processing a trace defendant for two to four hours. The Department of Justice is no longer threatening to take over the Harris County Jail.
More recently, Lykos (The Harris County District Attorney's Office) gave $475,000 to the Houston Police Department for a revolutionary advance in the fight against impaired drivers. This effort triples the number of permanently based Intoxilyzer breath-alcohol testing instruments in use by the Houston Police Department. Additionally, the entire test procedures and results will be digitally recorded.
The Harris County District Attorney’s Office received the 2011 Digital Government Achievement Award for the Consolidated Criminal History application. Additionally, the Technology Division created the Family Criminal Law Case Management System, the Check Fraud Case and Restitution Management System, and updated disaster recovery systems.
Houston Police Officers' Union.
Lykos filed for re-election on November 28, 2011. The next day, the Houston Police Officers' Union held a press conference denouncing Lykos’s drug policy that was instituted in January 2010. So, almost two years after the commencement of this drug policy, the union chose to publicly denounce Lykos. Concurrently, Mike Anderson, announced that he was seeking the Republican nomination for Harris County District Attorney.
Politicizing a Grand Jury.
At the end of the extended grand jury term for the 185th Grand Jury, the foreman, Patricia Pollard, a lawyer held a press conference denouncing the Lykos Administration. In 2005, Pollard wrote a letter to the Texas Legislature complaining of “widespread, massive and repeated” fraud. The Texas Senate Finance Committee invited Pollard to testify at a committee hearing in January 2006. After questioning from both Republicans and Democrats, Pollard was forced to admit that she had no evidence of “massive, widespread and repeated" fraud. Meanwhile, the Inspector General from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission testified about background checks to combat fraud, which completely countered Pollard’s baseless accusations.

2009 Asian Youth Games

The 1st Asian Youth Games was held in Singapore from June 29, 2009 to July 7, 2009 in over 90 sporting events. The plan for the Asian Youth Games was part of Singapore’s bid to stage the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics (YOG). The purpose was to allow youths to use the chance to benchmark their performances against youth teams from Asian nations. The Games also provided Singapore with an opportunity to test organisational and logistical capabilities in advance of the 2010 YOG. The organisation of the Games, spearheaded by the Singapore Sports Council, cost S$15 million, which was part of the $130 million for YOG.
Torch relay.
The 1st Asian Youth Games torch relay started on June 28 morning with the "Community and Corporate Leg". The flame lighting ceremony was held on June 28 at the Kallang Waterfront. The flame is then carried across the island in buses to arrive at the start of the three routes, named after the Olympic values of Friendship, Excellence and Respect. 
A total of 70 torchbearers were involved in day one of the relay.
The torch relay resumed on June 29 for the "Schools leg", with the flame travelling to 45 schools around Singapore, where over a hundred runners had the honour of carrying the torch.
The relay ended at the Singapore Indoor Stadium where three athletes ran in with the torches and light the cauldron as part of the Opening Ceremony celebrations.
Branding.
Theme song.
The theme song entitled "Asia's Youth, Our Future" was unveiled on March 19, 2009.
The song carries the message of hope and friendship and was composed by musician Iskandar Ismail, and written jointly by Jose Raymond and Hoo Cher Liek.
The singers are Nathan Hartono and Lian Kim Selby.
Emblem.
The official emblem of the 2009 Asian Youth Games was unveiled on November 14, 2008 and designed by Brainwave Design.
The logo, as described by Olympic Council of Asia, represents excellence and victory that the athletes will bring during the Games.
Mascot.
"Frasia", which means Friends of Asia, is the name of the official mascot for the 1st Asian Youth Games. The mascot embodies the values and spirit of the Asian Youth Games. The sprightly lion exemplifies friendship, respect and excellence. It constitutes a spirited representation of young hearts and minds in pursuit of sporting excellence.
Stamps.
Many countries' postal services have also released stamps, such as the Uzbekistan.
Broadcast.
The sports events were broadcast 'live' primarily via the official website through 4 concurrent 'live' streams during the games period. It was the first multi-sport event to receive approval from the Olympic Council of Asia to provide broadcast coverage of all the sports events completely via digital channels. Singapore's television channel, MediaCorp Channel 5 provided daily highlights of the Games. StarHub TV had 4 dedicated TV channels to provide coverage for the Games.
The opening ceremony was broadcast 'live' via the website. In addition, Video On-Demand Clips capturing key sporting highlights of the various games were made available.
Venues.
The Asian Youth Games and the 2010 Summer Youth Olympic Games are expected to use the same competition venues.
NTUC Downtown East originally was the planned Games Village for athletes and officials. However, a decision was made to move the Games Village to central Singapore at Swissotel The Stamford.
The change was made as NTUC Downtown East does not have enough beds for the athletes. Due to the H1N1 outbreak, Swissotel The Stamford catered the ninth floor to suspect cases in athletes.
Opening ceremony.
Themed "Asia's Youth, Our Future", the inaugural Asian Youth Games opening ceremony on June 29 was held in the Singapore Indoor Stadium. More than 1,400 performers from 20 schools and tertiary institutions are taking part in the opening ceremony. The opening ceremony was graced by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Representatives from the Olympic Council of Asia and the Singapore National Olympic Council were also be present.
There were three segments which were showcased: 'Asia's Zest', 'Garden in the City', and 'Spirit Of Evolution'.
The AYG cauldron was lit by three Singaporean young athletes, Tao Li (swimming), Remy Ong (bowling), and Jasmine Ser (shooting).
Participating nations.
The Singapore Asian Youth Games 2009 saw an estimated 1300 athletes aged between 14 and 17 from 43 countries competing in more than 80 sporting events.
Sports.
Attempts were made to stage all 26 YOG sports but, due to time and resource constraints, Singapore and the Olympic Council of Asia trimmed it to nine.
There were a total of 9 sports, the 8 that the Singapore and the Olympic Council of Asia trimmed down from the 26 YOG sports as well as an addition sport of Bowling which is not an official Olympics Sport.
Calendar.

John Bostock (physician)

John Bostock MD FRS (1773–1846) was an English physician, scientist and geologist from Liverpool. 
Life.
He spent some time at New College at Hackney where he attended Joseph Priestley's lectures on chemistry and natural philosophy, before graduating in Medicine at the University of Edinburgh and practising medicine in Liverpool. He moved to London in 1817 where he concentrated on general science. In 1819, Bostock was first to accurately describe hay fever as a disease that affected the upper respiratory tract. 
He lectured on chemistry at Guy's Hospital and was President of the Geological Society of London in 1826 when that body was granted a Royal Charter and Vice President of the Royal Society in 1832. 
Bostock died of cholera in 1846; He is buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery, London.
Works.
Bostock was one of the first chemical pathologists. He was the first to realise the relationship between the diminution of urea in urine as it rose in the blood, while the albumin in the blood fell as that in the urine increased. His most noted book, "System of Physiology", appeared in 1824. His only geological work was "On the Purification of Thames Water" which appeared in 1826.

This is a list of Christian religious houses, both for men and for women, whether or not still in operation, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Most religious houses survived the Reformation, although many nunneries did so by becoming Lutheran collegiate foundations for women of the aristocracy ("Damenstifte"). The great majority were closed however during the secularisation of the Napoleonic period, with the exception of the hospital orders, such as the Alexians and their female equivalents, the Cellite Sisters, the number of whose houses is a notable feature of the "Land". Also noteworthy are the small communities of local origin, such as the Olpe Sisters and the Schervier Sisters. Extant religious houses are indicated by bold type.

Kaltinėnai

Kaltinėnai is a small town in the west of Lithuania, located near Žemaičių highway in Šilalė district municipality, Tauragė County. Kaltinėnai has about 1000 inhabitants. The town is in a hollow, and it is rumoured that a large lake existed at the end of the Ice age where it now sits. Kaltinėnai is surrounded by famous mounds such as Skuburkalnis, Švedkalnis, Kepaluškalnis and Medvėgalis. There are also two rivers nearby, the Akmena and the Ižnė.
Notable buildings include the church, an old wooden synagogue, a home for the elderly and the Rehabilitation Centre.
History.
A stone axe discovered in the town suggests that the area was already inhabited by the Neolithic period. Historians believe that the town was originally part of a larger settlement, but later it split and Kaltinėnai became a separate region.
Kaltinėnai was first mentioned in a German chronicle as "terram Kalctene" in 1371. Northern Crusaders tried to conquer Kaltinėnai castle many times (in 1375, 1377 and 1389, also planned from 1386–1394), but local inhabitants repelled the attacks.
At the end of the 14th century and beginning of the 15th Kaltinėnai was one of 6–7 of the most important centres in Žemaitija. Signatures of noblemen from Kaltinėnai can be found on important documents. The town was so important that Vytautas the Great ordered one of the first Catholic churches in Žemaitija built in Kaltinėnai (the local population didn't convert to Christianity until 1413) and it was complete by 1421. The See of Žemaitija was founded in 1417 and it ruled the town for more than 400 years.
Kaltinėnai the town was established in 1524. It first appeared on a Polish map two years later, earlier than most of the surrounding towns.
There were more than 70 farms in Kaltinėnai as of 1638, but by 1668 only 50 remained. After the Great Northern War the town continued to decline, for example in 1773 there were only 15 farms that could pay a tax, 19 in 1778.
In 1842 authorities of the Russian tsar brought the ecclesiastical lands under their control and in 1861 made Kaltinėnai the volost centre. In 1901 a local teacher O. Skobinas published the book "Kaltinėnai town" in which he described contemporary town life. He wrote that a post office opened in 1861, a paramedic centre in 1882, a savings bank in 1897, and a chemist in 1898. Small markets took place every Wednesday, and large ones six times a year. 10 shops, several tearoom-canteens, and 17 craftsmen (seven tailors, five shoemakers, two blacksmiths, two glaziers and a woodworker) also worked in the town. 430 people lived in Kaltinėnai at that time—263 Catholics, 140 Jews, 15 Orthodox and 12 Evangelical Lutherans. Skobinas also mentions that many people had left the area for America to look for a better life.
Kaltinėnai inhabitants were very active in the 1905 Russian Revolution and the town also remained volost centre after the declaration of the Lithuania Independence Act in 1918. The town grew from 660 inhabitants in 1923 to 800 in 1939. Various shops were open in the town during that period, and there was a very active cultural life.
The German Occupation reached Kaltinėnai in June 1941. German soldiers and Lithuanians transferred all Jewish men aged 15 and older, along with those from nearby towns, to the Heydekrug (Silute) work camp. All the Jewish men of Kaltinėnai were killed before US troops arrived to liberate the region—one group of weak and elderly men in August 1941, another group in October and November, about 100 men in 1943 when they were transferred from Heydekrug to Auschwitz, some in a Warsaw typhus epidemic after Auschwitz, and the rest in Dachau in 1944. The Jewish women and children were made to do agricultural work, then in September 1941 they were shot en masse in Tūbinės forest about seven kilometres () from Kaltinėnai and buried in mass graves that eventually held 1200 people.
A Lithuanian Underground Representatives’ Congress gathered in Kaltinėnai on 5 September 1944. Its goal was to unite all patriotic organisations into one central resistance group. Although seven representatives were caught in an accident caused by Soviet reconnaissance, and German occupation authorities also sent their representative to the Congress, the Congress was nonetheless very important because the Lithuanian Army for Freedom came out of it as the main organiser of resistance.
On 7 October 1944 Kaltinėnai was occupied by the soviet army and the second Soviet Occupation began. Although this was one of the most difficult times in Lithuanian history, Kaltinėnai retained considerable significance as the centre of the precinct, kolkhoz and parish. The population declined sharply after World War II, but it began to climb again some years later.
Since Lithuania gained independence in 1990, Kaltinėnai has continued to honour its traditions. The town remains the centre of the eldership, which contains 74 settlements.
Kaltinėnai Aleksandras Stulginskis Gymnasium.
A parish school was founded in Kaltinėnai in 1777. This was later divided into four departments of primary school. In 1944 a pro-gymnasium was founded and after five years it was reorganised into a school with seven forms. In 1951 this school became the secondary school, and in 1969 a new school building was constructed.
Since 1992 the school has participated in a foreign exchange program with the German Hankensbüttel Gymnasium.
On 20 December 1999 the school was named Aleksandras Stulginskis Secondary School, and on 29 January 2009 the school became a gymnasium.
The school now has both primary and secondary divisions, as well as some divisions in nearby villages. The primary school is housed in the former hostel, with four years of study and a kindergarten.
The secondary school is housed in a two-story building with six forms, two optional higher forms, administrative offices, a canteen, a library, two gyms and an Aleksandras Stulginskis museum. There are over 500 students and over 50 teachers.
In 2006 the school won a grant to improve its energy use and was renovated.
The Church.
Since Vytautas the Great built the first wooden church in 1416, there have been about six wooden churches in Kaltinėnai. Some of these churches burned down and others simply collapsed.
The second-most recent church was built in 1896 and burned down in 1988. Only a traditional masonry stone fence, its gate and a wooden belfry remain. After the belfry was rearranged into a temporary chapel it lost the original form somewhat.
The current church, known as the church of St. John the Baptist, was built in 1995. It is a modern sacral architecture building with two high triangular towers and a high white marble and bronze sculpture of The Risen Christ by A. Vaura. V. Švanys created stained glass windows for the basement chambers of the church.
The Graveyard.
The parish graveyard is on the west side of the town. There is an octagonal wooden folk architecture chapel on the hill, built in 1798 and restored in 1989. There are also many saints’ sculptures on the same hill.
The chapel is surrounded by many very old, historical and artistic graves around the chapel, marked with metallic crosses and other gravestones. A high stone obelisk for Dionizas Poška stands near the chapel. Poška was a great poet and founder of the "Baubliai" museum, the first history museum in Lithuania. Marijona Stulginskienė (Aleksandras Stulginskis's mother) is buried on the southeast side of the graveyard hill.
The Pilės mound (Kepaluškalnis).
The Pilės mound (or Kepaluškalnis) is one of the most valuable cultural monuments in the Šilalė region.
Its hillsides stand at high, and the upper part of the mound is about . Its sides were originally surrounded by defence ramparts that are now flat, but the location of two ramparts is still visible, as are three defence ditches.
Based on the size of the mound and the dimensions of its fortifications, one of the strongest castles in Žemaitija stood on the Pilės Mound during the war with the Cruasders. There have also been various archaeological finds on the mound, such as stone shells.
The Rehabilitation Centre.
The Rehabilitation Centre of Kaltinėnai stands near the church. It was built by local priest Petras Linkevičius.
The Centre offers a swimming pool, salt and herb baths, underwater massage and a comfortable training-hall.

49th Fighter Training Squadron

The 49th Fighter Training Squadron is part of the 14th Flying Training Wing based at Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi. It operates T-38 Talon aircraft conducting flight training.
The squadron was first activated as the 49th Pursuit Squadron in 1941 during the expansion of the United States military that preceded World War II. Immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the squadron flew air defense patrols off the southern Pacific coast. In 1942 it was redesignated the 49th Fighter Squadron and deployed to England, but a few months later the squadron moved to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations. The squadron earned a Distinguished Unit Citation in 1944 and was inactivated in 1945.
The squadron was activated again at Dow Field, Maine as one of the first units of Air Defense Command (ADC). It converted to Republic F-84 Thunderjets, being one of the first squadrons to do so. The squadron was inactivated in 1949.
In 1952 the squadron, now designated the 49th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, was activated to replace an Air National Guard squadron that was being released from active duty at Dow. For the next thirty-five years the unit carried out the air defense mission at Dow, Hanscom Field, and Griffiss Air Force Base, upgrading its aircraft until equipping with the Convair F-106 Delta Dart, which it flew for almost twenty years. The squadron was the last to fly that plane, inactivating in 1987 as the Air National Guard took over air defense mission.
The unit was reactivated in 1990 as the 49th Flying Training Squadron at Columbus Air Force Base. Mississippi. It conducted the advanced phase of undergraduate pilot training and basic procedures and techniques of fighter employment since then except for a brief period when it was inactive in 1992-1993. In 2003 its name was changed to 49th Fighter Training Squadron to reflect this mission.
Mission.
The 49th Fighter Training Squadron conducts Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals flying training for Air Force and international pilots and weapon systems officers. It flies over 2,400 hours annually. Its mission is to develop the ability, proficiency, confidence, discipline, judgment, situational awareness and airmanship of future fighter wingmen.
In addition, unit members deploy to support fighter syllabus and operational training requirements for close air support and dissimilar air combat training.
History.
World War II.
The squadron was first activated in early 1941 at Hamilton Field, California as the 49th Pursuit Squadron one of the original three squadrons of the 14th Pursuit Group. The squadron trained with Republic P-43 Lancers until it was equipped with early model Lockheed P-38 Lightnings. After the Pearl Harbor Attack the squadron deployed to San Diego Municipal Airport where it flew air defense patrols for a week before returning to March Field later in the month.
In August 1942 the squadron deployed to the European Theater of Operations and flew escort missions for Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers as part of VIII Fighter Command until November.
The 49th was sent to North Africa in late 1942 as part of the Operation Torch invasion forces, taking up station in Algeria. The unit was reassigned to Twelfth Air Force and flew both fighter escort missions for the B-17s operating from Algeria, as well as tactical interdiction strikes on enemy targets of opportunity in Algeria and Tunisia during the North African Campaign. The 49th flew strafing and reconnaissance missions until January 1943, when the unit was withdrawn from combat and some aircraft and personnel were assigned to other units. In May, it resumed operations.
Following the German defeat and withdrawal from North Africa the squadron flew dive bombing attacks during the assault on Pantelleria. It helped prepare for and support Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, and Operation Avalanche, the invasion of Italy. It engaged primarily in escort operations after November 1943, flying missions to cover bombers on long-range missions attacking strategic objectives in Italy, France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Rumania and Bulgaria. The squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions on 2 April 1944 when it beat off attacks by enemy fighter aircraft, enabling the bombers it covered to strike a ball-bearing factory in Austria.
The squadron also provided support for reconnaissance operations. It deployed to Corsica in August 1944 to support Allied Forces in Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France. The unit continued to fly long range missions to strafe and dive bomb targets in an arc from France to the Balkan Peninsula until the surrender of Germany in May 1945. The squadron was inactivated in Italy in September of that year.
Cold War air defense.
Early operations.
The squadron was once more activated in the US on 20 November 1946 at Dow Field, Maine as part of the First Air Force of Air Defense Command (ADC). The squadron was one of the first operational units assigned to ADC.
The 49th was initially equipped with Republic P-47N Thunderbolts and later with first generation P-84B Thunderjets. It was responsible for air defense of the Northeastern United States. In 1947, the units's parent group became the first in the AAF to equip with the P-84. 
The 37th's mission was daylight and fair weather defense of northeast United States from New York City north to the Maine/New Brunswick border, shared with 52d Fighter Group (All-Weather) at Mitchel AFB, New York which flew F-82 Twin Mustangs for night and inclement weather operations. The squadron was inactivated on 2 October 1949. 
Air defense of the northeast.
The squadron was redesignated the 49th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and reactivated on 1 November 1952 and was once agains stationed at Dow Air Force Base, where it was assigned to the 4711th Defense Wing. At Dow the squadron assumed the mission, personnel, and Lockheed F-80C Shooting Stars of the 132d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was simultaneously inactivated. The 132d was a Maine Air National Guard unit that had been mobilized in February 1951 for the Korean War. Upon inactivation the 132d was returned to the control of the Guard.
Five months after activation, the squadron upgraded to North American F-86F Sabre aircraft. Both the F-80C and F-86F were
day interceptor aircraft, but the F-86 was faster and more agile. In March 1954, however the squadron converted to HVAR rocket armed and airborne intercept radar equipped F-86D Sabres, giving it an all weather capability. In November 1955, the squadron and its F-86Ds moved to Hanscom Field near Boston where it was reassigned to the 4707th Air Defense Wing.
In October 1956 the squadron re-equipped with its third version of the F-86, the F-86L. The F-86L incorporated data link, which enabled it to communicate directly with Semi Automatic Ground Environment direction centers without the need for voice communications. The unit operated the F-86L for the remainder of its tenure at Hanscom.
In October 1959 the 49th and the 465th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Griffiss Air Force Base, New York traded places, with each squadron assuming the mission, aircraft and personnel of the other. At Griffiss, the 49th joined the 27th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in the 4727th Air Defense Group until October, when the 27th moved and there was no longer a need for a group headquarters for ADC fighter squadrons so the 4727th was discontinued. The 49th initially operated Northrop F-89J Scorpions, which were armed with the AIR-2 Genie, a nuclear capable Air-to-air rocket. However, by December 1959 the squadron had begun to upgrade to supersonic McDonnell F-101B Voodoos, and the F-101F operational and conversion trainer. The two-seat trainer version was equipped with dual controls, but carried the same AIR-2 armament as the F-101B and was combat capable. 
The squadron operated Voodoos until September 1968, the aircraft being passed along to the Air National Guard as the squadron re-equipped with Convair F-106 Delta Darts. There were a total of forty-six F-106's assigned to the 49th at Griffiss between 30 September 1968 until its inactivation on 30 September 1987. F-106s 59-0062 and 59-0136 were the last two Delta Darts in active-duty USAF service, being sent to The Aircraft Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona on 9 July 1987. 
The squadron was initially programmed to receive F-15 Eagles to be used in the interceptor mission, however it was decided to inactivate the unit as part of the transfer of the air defense mission in the United States to the Air National Guard. The 49th Fighter Interceptor Squadron was the last active USAF F-106 unit. 
Pilot training.
The unit was reactivated in 1990 as the 49th Flying Training Squadron at Columbus Air Force Base. Mississippi. It conducted the advanced phase of undergraduate pilot training for two years before inactivating two years later.
It was activated again in 1994 and since then has taught basic procedures and techniques of fighter employment. It moved to Moody Air Force Base, Georgia in 2000, but returned to Columbus in 2007. In 2003 its name was changed to 49th Fighter Training Squadron to reflect this mission.

1978 — 1993.
Sadia worked largely with the Canadian guitar player David Wilcox, producing the albums 'Out of the Woods', 'My Eyes Keep Me In Trouble', 'Bad Reputation', 'Breakfast at the Circus', and 'The Natural Edge', many of which achieved gold or platinum status. She also co-wrote many of the titles on these albums. On these discs, she is billed simply as 'Sadia', or occasionally, "S. Sadia." These recordings also formed the basis of a number of 'Greatest Hits' packages, including the platinum-selling 'Over Sixty Minutes With'.
1993 — present.
Founding member of the multimedia world fusion project Equa with Stephen W. Tayler. Signed to Polygram (Australia) in 1996, producing the eponymously titled ARIA nominated album 'EQUA' in the same year.
The Sydney Dance Company has two works in their permanent repertoire, 'Unwitting Sight' (1998) and 'Cradle Song' (2001) choreographed by Wakako Asano to music by Equa.
In 1996, Sadia also worked on the TUC 'Respect:Unite Against Racism' campaign, producing the single 'Respect' featuring dozens of international recording artists. The project received a commendation from the House of Commons (UK) through the passage of an Early Day Motion (EDM), as well as national media coverage..
Sadia's work has been widely sequenced to films and television programmes by companies such as Polygram/Miramax, Interscope, and Universal Pictures, among others.
Film and installations.
Sadia produced, edited, and (working with Stephen W. Tayler as Equa) scored the short film The Noon Gun. Based on footage originally shot in Afghanistan in 1971, and with the support of the British Council,The Noon Gun had its world premiere at the 53rd Melbourne International Film Festival in August 2004. It subsequently had its UK premiere at the National Museum for Photography, Film and Television (now the National Media Museum ) in Bradford in September 2004. Shortlisted for the Satyajit Ray Foundation Short Film Competition, it has featured in film festivals worldwide.
As a filmmaker, Sadia has also produced and edited the short 'The End of the Party: Hyde Park 1969', a view of the 60's based on previously unseen footage of the famous first performance by Blind Faith in Hyde Park; produced and edited 'Iggy the Eskimo Girl', a short featuring Syd Barrett's (Pink Floyd) girlfriend Iggy, ubiquitously and affectionately known in the 1960s as 'Iggy the Eskimo girl'; and directed, produced and edited the film 'Lit From Within: The Film and Glass Works of Anthony Stern', a short documentary by Sadia about the filmmaker and glass artist Anthony Stern, which explores some of Anthony's life and works, and examines the aesthetic and philosophical relationship between glass and film as materials through which light passes. She also worked as director, editor, producer and sound designer on 'San Francisco Redux No. 1', the first installment of a multi-channel installation work. The latter films had their world premiere as part of the curated programme 'Le Cinema D'Avant-Garde' at Cinémathèque Française in Paris, France on June 27, 2008.
Sadia is also the creator of the single channel video installation 'The Memory of Water (Part 1)' which was acquired by ACMI (The Australian Centre for the Moving Image) to form part of its permanent collection of exemplary works by Australian and international artists. It featured in the exhibition 'Proof: The Act of Seeing With One's Own Eyes'. The work ran as a loop from 09.12.04 to 13.02.05 as part of the show, as well as appearing on a number of exterior screens in Federation Square, Melbourne.
Sadia is an occasional contributor to the photography magazine 'DayFour', most recently in the DayFour 'Ulysses II' publication and exhibition at printspace, London, December 2010- January 2011.
In 2009, Sadia was awarded a Studio 18 artists' residency, for international "contemporary visual artists pursuing an innovative practice in a professional capacity", at Gertrude Contemporary in Melbourne, Australia. This also marked the first public view of her 2009 installation work 'Noise/Ghosts of Noise'.
During this time she commenced work on her filmed multi-channel installation, 'Metamorphoses in 'A' Minor, filmed at the Kennedy Miller Mitchell motion capture soundstage at Sydney Gate in Sydney, Australia, with the support of Gertrude Contemporary and a British Council (Aus) Project Grant. The work takes place over three ‘movements’ or ‘chapters’, 'Formation', 'Emergence' and 'Flight' and features the Australian dancer and choreographer Wakako Asano, a longtime performer with the Sydney Dance Company under the tenure of creative director Graeme Murphy. It is set to an original neo-classical composition produced in collaboration with the UK composer and sound artist Stephen W. Tayler (Suzanne Vega, Peter Gabriel, Eric Serra, Bob Geldof, Kate Bush), using recorded layers and repetitive themes that build sequentially until an eventual moment of release. It is a work in the tradition of symbolic mysticism, an exploration of the transformative nature of the individual. The work relies heavily on time manipulation, and part of the challenge was to both produce and improvise movement that would be played back at speeds other than the speed at which it was originally filmed. This also provided cinematographic challenges, which were met through the use of digital cameras, including a Phantom high-speed digital camera running at 1500 fps (frames per second) to produce ultra-slow-motion.
Since January 2013 Sadia has been based out of Real World Studios.
In January 2014, Sadia completed ‘All Time and Space Fold into the Infinite Present (Cataract Gorge)’ a large-scale three channel filmed installation with an accompanying eight channel soundfield. The work features footage of the rapids captured by the artist in Cataract Gorge, Launceston, Tasmania. The footage has been slowed down and colour balanced to resemble deep space, while the motion remains that of the water. This produces a meditative work that draws together the artist’s ideas about time, space, and the land. The accompanying eight (8) channel soundfield is constructed of audio captured by the artist in the Gorge.
The work premiered at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery (QVMAG) Inveresk, Launceston, Tasmania, Australia’s largest regional museum, on January 10, 2014 and runs through March 2, 2014.
Books.
On June 26, 2013 Sadia's first book 'Notes To An Unknown Lover' was released by Bybrook Press. It is held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford University.

Farpi Vignoli

Farpi Vignoli (August 21, 1907 – November 1997) was an Italian sculptor. He was born and died in Bologna.
Biography.
Farpi Vignoli was born in Bologna in August 1907 (where he will live up to November 1997), from Callisto Vignoli, a carpenter, and Ersilia Tagliavini. He was the younger of three brothers. (The first name, unusual, born from a longer name that his father was tring to compose). It spends the infancy and the first adolescence in a house near the racecourse of the Arcoveggio (from which the inspiration for the "Il guidatore di sulki" (The Sulky Driver) " and then for the "horse"). In 1919 he was admitted to the College Venturoli, where he studied painting, sculpture, architecture following sculptor Enrico Barberi's teachings. In this period a brotherly friendship was born with Paolo Manaresi. In the same period the friendship with the sculptor Luciano Minguzzi was consolidated, as he they continued in the Academy with the same teacher Ercole Drei, then busy in the realization of the marmoreal Images of Liberty and Victory for the Chartreuse in Bologna. Concluded then the Art Academy, in 1934 he begins in Bologna with a personal exposition.
In the II "Quadriennale" in Rome, in 1935 (on invitation of the founder Cipriano Efisio Oppo), the "The Sulky Driver" was awarded the right to participate to the Olympiads in Berlin in 1936. During the following years: the "Tennis player" in 1936; the "Shot of rope" in 1937; the "Jumper" in 1938, this last suggestively suspended between sky and earth with an unusual equilibrium of oblique auctions. 
In 1936 he won the gold medal in the art competitions of the Olympic Games for his "Guidatore di sulky" ("The Sulky Driver").
Then Vignoli changes style and abandoned the sporting subject. In 1939, he introduced to the III Quadriennale, in Rome, the "prelude of love" opening a new period of creativeness more "eclectic". In the same years he realized two gigantic bas-reliefs for façade of "the Farmer's House" (today "Chamber Federate of Job") in Bologna. In 1940 wins (with "Four Horses") the façade of EUR, in Rome, and then two great trophies for the same complex. In 1941 the portrait of a friend: the poet Alfonso Gatto.
The resumption of the activity.
In the immediate postwar period, the new generations mature the rebellion against the preceding period. In this phase Vignoli devoted himself with passion to the watercolor painting (his favorite technique, since college), surprisingly innovating its chromatic and materic principles, reaching brightness and tones, more allied with the technique of the fresco, to the point that Virgilio Guidi defined the result: "a true ransom" toward the other "nobler techniques". 
Vignoli returns to the sculpture from the 1950 with various works: "Grave Frassetto", in the Chartreuse in Bologna; the portraits of American actors (among which were Tyrone Power and the director Henry King); "Grave Ennio Gnudi" (Mayor of Bologna in the 1920), always in the Chartreuse; the " bronzy Monument to the Bersaglieris fallen in Russia " (Bologna); his " Mother " and others. In 1957 he planned and directed the construction of the architectural complex for the Art Academy in Bologna, compreending the Theater for the School of Scenography, very appreciated by architect Gabor Acs. Then new errands of sculptures: "The Stele to the cripples of war " bronze (Park S. Violet, Bologna), the Monument of "St. Francis and the wolf" (Gubbio), bronze; the Ciborium of the Cathedral of Casalecchio, natural bronze ; " Mariarosa, the young teacher ", marble (Chartreuse); "the Horse" (Castel S. Pietro), bronze great to the truth.
In the last period of activity, among 1980 and 1990, the new sporting subjects, in bronze: "Hang-gliding, Windsurfer, Giacomo Agostini, Björn Borg, Motocross".
Bibliographical signs.
We can find first useful elements for reconstructing the artistic personality of Vignoli in the anthology of Eugenio Riccoboni of the 1942 " Rome in the art. The sculpture in the modern age ", and, subsequently, in the book of Francesco Sapori of the 1949 on his " Modern Italian Sculpture ".

Saxon V K

The Saxon Class V K were German, eight-coupled, narrow gauge steam locomotives operated by the Royal Saxon State Railways which had been primarily intended for the "Müglitztalbahn". In 1925 the Deutsche Reichsbahn incorporated arranged these locomotives as DRG Class 99.61.
History.
For the hilly line of the "Müglitztalbahn" from Mügeln to Geising-Altenberg the Sächsische Maschinenfabrik in Chemnitz developed an eight-coupled locomotive which, it was envisaged, would handle this route better that the hitherto deployed Saxon Classes I K and IV K. 
In 1901 and from 1905 to 1907 a total of nine locomotives were placed in service. Those built in 1905 had a slightly larger driver's cab. 
Whilst the new type of drive using Klien-Lindner axles allowed the eight-coupled engines to negotiate tight curves, in the end the new Class V K proved just as complicated and maintenance-intensive as the tried and tested IV K. 
For that reason no more were procured, despite their better starting characteristics.
All nine engines, numbered 201 to 209 were taken over in 1920 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and in 1925 were renumbered to 99 611 to 99 619.
Between 1934 and 1942 the locomotives were all retired. It is possible that several locomotives were left on the battlefields of the Second World War following duties at the front.
Technical features.
The boiler had the same dimensions as the Saxon IV K. The boiler feed was provided by two "Friedmann" injectors. The steam engine itself was a two-cylinder compound which drove the second coupled axle. The low-pressure cylinder on the right was set at an angle due to its large size. The first and fourth coupled axles were Klien-Lindner hollow axles which enabled an outside frame with Hall cranks. Two pull rods arranged in a cross enabled the transverse movement of the two hollow axles to be set by the same amount.
For braking, the locomotives were originally equipped with a steam brake and counterweight brake. In addition the locomotives were fitted for Heberlein brakes. But by 1920 they were given the new "Körting" vacuum brakes for engine and train.
The water supplies were carried in side tanks; the coal was stored in a bunker behind the cab.
Duties.
The six locomotives went into service on the "Müglitztalbahn". Even after the appearance of the more powerful VI K they remained on this route. After the conversion of the "Müglitztalbahn" to standard gauge in the 1930s the locomotives were transferred to other lines. They were used on the Mügeln and Thum railway networks and the Taubenheim–Dürrhennersdorf narrow gauge railway.

Abbey Lee Kershaw

Abbey Lee Kershaw (born 12 June 1987), also known as Abbey Lee, is an Australian fashion model. Following several years of success leading up to the 2011 fashion seasons, "V" magazine dubbed Kershaw a supermodel.
Early life.
Kershaw was born in Melbourne. She says that as a child, she was "always in the hospital." At age four, she suffered from meningitis and had to have two spinal taps. She also had a tumour on the knee, and several broken bones from climbing trees. She grew up in Kensington and attended St Michael's Catholic Primary school in North Melbourne in which she stated that she "grew up with 42 nationalities" explaining in an interview that her primary school of 150 children was very multicultural. She then attended the Academy of Mary Immaculate in Fitzroy. She later went on to win the Australian 2004 "Girlfriend Model Search". After high school, in 2005, she moved from Melbourne to Sydney to begin modelling. She lived 100 metres from the beach and it was while at the beach where she got scouted by Chic Management's Kathy Ward, the model scout that also discovered Miranda Kerr and Samantha Harris. She signed with Chic Management within weeks.
Career.
2007–09.
In 2007, Kershaw signed with Next Management and by March had moved to New York City. On 11 December, Models.com named her the "Next Superstar".
Kershaw made her debut in the 2008 New York Fashion Week, managing to walk a total of 29 shows for designers such as Oscar de la Renta, Halston, and notably closing for Rodarte. For her first time in Milan Fashion Week, she was booked as a Gucci exclusive. Later that year, in September, she fell in her high heels at the Rodarte show in New York. Then, a month later in Paris, she fainted at the Alexander McQueen show from wearing a very tight leather corset. Regardless of these two incidents, it did not affect her from booking more runways shows. Kershaw was one of new faces to appear on one of the fourteen covers of "V magazine's" Autumn issue. On 15 November 2008, in Miami, she made her international TV appearance at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, modelling in the "Pink Planet" segment.
Kershaw has starred in the fragrance ads for Gucci's new "Flora" scent since 2008.
In November 2009, Fashion TV placed her first in their First Face Countdown for Spring/Summer 2010. Kershaw had to sit out the Autumn 2009 shows due to a knee injury: she had torn ligaments and could barely walk. Kershaw was featured in the explicit shoot for the French magazine "Purple Fashion" published Autumn/winter 2009. The infamous spread, shot by photographer Terry Richardson, caused outrage in the blogosphere, where Richardson was accused of cajoling the girls for his own sexual satisfaction. In his defense, Kershaw said, "Terry doesn't force girls to do anything they don't want to. He puts you in a G-string in a pile of mud because you want to do it. You touch yourself because you want to. For me, that shoot was the truth about how things were between us both, and I felt good doing it. I'm not ashamed of it—why should I be?" After skipping the Autumn 2009 season owing to a knee injury, Kershaw reappeared in Milan Fashion Week, opening D&G to having the first and last looks at Fendi and Versace, prompting "New York Magazine" to name her "Milan's Top Model". On 1 December 2009, for the second time, she participated in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, but this time she had three outfits, modelling in the "Star Trooper," "Pink Planet", and in the "Enchanted Forest" segment.
2010–11.
In 2010, Kershaw was heavily in demand for campaigns, shoots and shows. Kershaw was featured in the 2010 Pirelli Calendar photographed by Terry Richardson, and the 2011 Pirelli Calendar photographed by Karl Lagerfeld. In March 2010, it was announced that she will be the face of Chanel's Autumn/Winter 2010/2011 ready-to-wear ad campaign. This news came after she closed the Chanel Spring 2010 couture show, and opened the Chanel Autumn/Winter 2010/2011 ready-to-wear show. In November, for the fourth time, she became the cover model of Australian "Vogue" (her previous covers of the same publication were in March 2010, March 2009, and September 2008).
She took her own self-portrait for the new Rag & Bone Do-It-Yourself ad campaign spring 2011 along with models Sasha Pivovarova, Edita Vilkeviciute, Karolina Kurkova, Candice Swanepoel and Lily Aldridge. She earned $100,000 as an exclusive for Chanel, walking for their spring-summer collection in Paris. She skipped New York Fashion Week for London. "V" Magazine's "The Discovery Issue" crowned Abbey Lee Kershaw as the new Supermodel. The magazine called Kershaw "the biggest fashion export from Down Under since Elle Macpherson joined the ranks of Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington."
Kershaw has been on the May 2011 cover of "Numero", photographed by Tom Munro.
2012–present.
Kershaw has been absent from the runway since the Fall 2012 shows where she walked only for Alexander Wang and Anna Sui. During 2012 she focused on acting and spent much of the year in Africa, as part of the production of the upcoming post-apocalyptic film "".
Although Kershaw was ranked 4th at the height of her career on the "Top 50 Models Women" list by models.com, she currently ranks 12th on the list, as of June 2013. and is ranked 21st on the "Top Money Girls" list by models.com.
Kershaw appeared in the Fall/Winter 2013–14 Campaign for Gucci alongside male model Adrien Sahores, shot by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott.
Personal life.
She is friends with models Freja Beha Erichsen, Karmen Pedaru, Joan Smalls and Catherine McNeil. She has a pet lizard named Annie Hall. Kershaw has 10 piercings in total: on her nose (her left nostril), on the nipple, a pierced belly button, and seven on her ears. She also has various tattoos, including; a small peace sign on the palm of her hand, an owl on her middle finger, the symbol for Gemini on her ankle, and a tattoo reading "truth", hidden on the inside of her bottom lip. She has recently added two on the side of her stomach done in white ink. Kershaw is also an artist who does abstract painting and uses oil pastels. She is a drummer in an Australian band and hopes to pursue a broader music career in the future.
Her father, Kim Kershaw, played in the Victorian Football League for Richmond and Hawthorn.

The song is a country ballad that begins with the female narrator noticing her phone ringing, and refusing to answer it because she recognizes the number. The woman is aware that the male character is most likely in a bar and drinking alcohol. Therefore, she refuses to answer her phone because she knows that she is always his "last call". This is a play on the bartending term "last call", which refers to the last round of alcohol served before the bar closes for the night.
Critical reception.
"Last Call" was well received by critics, being met with several positive reviews and was nominated for two awards.
Allmusic reviewer Thom Jurek called the song " a classic example of what makes Womack such a fascinating and emotionally resonant singer." Country Universe gave it an A rating, and considered that "Last Call" was reminiscent of her 2005 hit, "I May Hate Myself in the Morning". The song received a "thumbs up" review from The 9513 reviewer Brady Vercher, who also compared the song to "I May Hate Myself in the Morning" and said that "although the lyric doesn't accentuate the emotional conflict, Womack's vocal dips with indecision as she delivers a splendid performance." This song was number 52 on "Rolling Stone"'s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2008. Editors at "Billboard" wrote, "Haunting single “Last Call” is song-of-the-year material on a number of levels: songwriting, vocal performance and production." Chuck Arnold of "People Magazine" listed the song as a hot download and wrote, "Lee Ann Womack will have you busting out the hankies with the touching breakup ballad "Last Call."
In December 2008, the song received a Grammy award nomination for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. "Last Call" also received a nomination for Female Video of the Year in the 2009 CMT Music Awards.
Music video.
A music video directed by Trey Fanjoy was released for "Last Call." The video is done entirely in black and white, and was shot in New York City. In it, Womack is seen strolling down the street and standing on a balcony of a skyscraper, while scenes of a man drinking in a bar follows the song's lyrics. He attempts to call Womack, which prompts her to examine her phone and not answer. Singer Clayton Stroope of the band Thriving Ivory is featured as Womack's lover in the video.
Chart performance.
"Last Call" debuted at number 56 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart in July 2008. The song reached a peak of number 14 in February 2009, after spending over 36 weeks on the chart.

Gene Karst

Gene Karst is recognized as the first dedicated publicist in the history of Major League Baseball (MLB). He was hired in by Branch Rickey, then the General Manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, to write features about the Cardinals for small-town newspapers that could not afford to cover the team in person. To do this, Karst set up MLB's first press office. In this post, he wrote stories, created promotions, and made players available for interviews and guest appearances. He spent four years in this position with the Cardinals before moving on to join the Cincinnati Reds in the same capacity.
While with the Reds, Karst played a major role in baseball history by creating as a promotion MLB's first night game. The game was played on May 24, , with the Cincinnati Reds defeating the Philadelphia Phillies 2-1 at Cincinnati's Crosley Field.
In 2001, Karst was inducted into the St. Louis Media Hall of Fame. He died on April 6, 2004, at age 97 in Ladue, Missouri.

S.C.U.M (band)

S.C.U.M were a South East London based post-punk/art rock group. Its members were Thomas Cohen (vocals), Bradley Baker (machines, press), Samuel Kilcoyne (keyboards), Huw Webb (bass) and Melissa Rigby (drums). The band previously included Ruaridh Connellan (drums) and Joseph Williams (bass, media). S.C.U.M take their name from Valerie Solanas' manifesto, SCUM Manifesto, an ironic reference to the all-male band before Connellan's dismissal.
History.
S.C.U.M formed in early 2008, its initial line-up consisting of Thomas Cohen, Bradley Baker, Samuel Kilcoyne (founder of the Underage club nights and the festival spin off as well as the son of Add N to X's Barry 7), drummer Ruaridh Connellan and bassist Joseph Williams who left early on in the band's career due to his priorities, which lay in his desire to become a barrister.
S.C.U.M's debut single "Visions Arise" was released on Loog Records on 15 September 2008. Since then the band have toured extensively across the UK and Europe to a growing fan base and released three exclusive digital download tracks called SIGNALS. While S.C.U.M were travelling across Europe performing shows, they were taking studio time in each city they visited to record new works specific to each location. The music documented their sonic journey and acted as an audio visual scrapbook of the bands travels and musical progression. S.C.U.M have recorded a series of "SIGNALS" in Warsaw, Berlin, Paris and recently in Athens. S.C.U.M "SIGNAL (4) ATHENS" will be released later this year. Paris was the most extreme of these; the band described it as a painting of their minds at the time. Cohen later said "Paris was the one that started it, i just remember taking to bed one night after contemplating the early Dada artists and the lyrics came to me in a screen of emotion signals". They were featured and interviewed in the April 2010 edition of "Mojo".
S.C.U.M. were chosen by Portishead to perform at the ATP I'll Be Your Mirror festival that they curated in July 2011 at London's Alexandra Palace. On 18 July 2011, "Amber Hands" was released by Mute Records, described by Pitchfork as "the mammoth first single from the London shoegazers".
The band recorded their debut album with producers Ken and Jolyon Thomas whose production credits (individually and together) include David Bowie, Public Image Ltd, Sigur Ros and Psychic TV among others. The album "Again Into Eyes" was released on 12 September 2011, via Mute and received generally positive reviews, with a 7.3 rating from aggregating website AnyDecentMusic? (based on nine professional reviews).
On 11 December 2011 Thomas Cohen and his girlfriend Peaches Geldof (daughter of musician Bob Geldof) announced their engagement. Geldof announced on 5 January 2012 that she was pregnant with her and Cohen's first child. Their son was born in April 2012 and was named Astala Dylan Willow Geldof-Cohen. Cohen has fought speculation that he will leave S.C.U.M and has fought against accusations that his life with the higher-profile gossip magazine star Geldof will see him sell out his hipster image.
On 27 August 2012 Rough Trade exclusively released what they dubbed a 'lost EP' by the band. The limited edition run of 300 7" vinyl was recorded at 1-2-3-4 HQ studios in East London and intended as a self-release. However, due to a mix-up at the pressing plant, the vinyl went missing. A recent clear-out of a storage cupboard revealed the metalwork for the pressing and it was returned to the band who approached Rough Trade about releasing it.
On 12 January 2013 S.C.U.M. announced via Facebook that they were splitting up after their long hiatus. They also made hints of solo projects to come soon.
In June 2013 it was announced that former members Melissa Rigby, Huw Webb and Bradley Baker had undertaken a new project named Astral Pattern. The dream pop band released a first single Sitting in the Sun and that an EP titled Light Poems would be released shortly.
Musical style and influences.
S.C.U.M have claimed that they are not influenced by anyone musically, though they have spoken of a love for Throbbing Gristle, Ghost and Liars. Commenting on some British tabloids' calling him "a pretentious rocker", Cohen said: "It's because we don't make music about social issues so it comes across as unsocial and therefore pretentious. Which is rubbish." The band have stated in interviews that some of their songs deal with emotional fluctuations caused by visual manifestations of coloured shapes representing repressed lust. The band's post-punk revival sound as well as the fact that Huw Webb is the brother of Rhys Webb from The Horrors has led to many comparisons between the bands and, with TOY, they have been dubbed 'baby Horrors' by some negative critics.

Miss Czech Republic

Miss České republiky () was a national beauty pageant from the Czech Republic.
History.
Before Miss Czech Republic existed, there was a similar pageant that took place between 1966 and 1979, known as "Girl of the Year". Alžběta Štrkulová, a popular TV presenter in the Czech Republic, won in 1967. At the time, she was the most successful titleholder in the Eastern bloc. Unfortunately, this competition was banned by communist regime.
Miss Czech Republic used to send its winner to Miss Universe or Miss Europe, after a while only sent it to Miss World, then to neither. It would also choose representatives to international competitions like Miss International, "Miss Intercontinental, Miss Model of the year, Queen of the World" and "Miss Maja International".
Miss Czech Republic began in 1989 under the name "Miss Czechoslovak Socialist Republic". In 1990 the competition was renamed "Miss Czechoslovak Federative Republic". In 1993, when Czechoslovakia split into two countries (the Czech Republic and Slovakia), the competition was renamed "Miss Czech and Slovak Republic". Since 1994 it became Miss České republiky, organized by director Miloš Zapletal between 1989 and 2008. In 2009, Miss World 2006, Taťána Kuchařová, became the new director.
In 2005, former titleholder Michaela Maláčová founded rival competition Česká Miss, which now sends representatives to Miss Universe, Miss World and Miss Earth. In 2010, the two organizations signed an agreement of partnership, where the two rival organizations would have Maláčová as president.

March of Remembrance and Hope

The March of Remembrance and Hope (MRH) is a program designed for university and college students of all religions and backgrounds. The program takes place in mid-May, and includes a two-day trip to Germany, followed by a five day visit to Poland. The international MRH program was founded in 2001 by Dr. David Machlis of the United States and Eli Rubenstein of Canada, both of whom were involved in the March of the Living program.
During the trip students visit locations in Germany and Poland related to the Holocaust and other World War II genocides, including the site of the Wannsee Conference, and the former concentration/death camps of Auschwitz, Treblinka and Majdanek.
The purpose of the March of Remembrance and Hope is to teach students of various religious and ethnic backgrounds about the dangers of intolerance through the study of the Holocaust and other World War II genocides, and to promote better relations among people of diverse cultures.
Holocaust survivors also participate in the March of Remembrance and Hope program, sharing their painful memories in the very places in which their stories transpired. During the trip, the students also meet one of the Righteous Among the Nations, and learn of the heroic actions a minority of Europe's population took to resist Nazi tyranny.
Since its inception, students of many diverse religions, backgrounds and ethnicities have taken part in the March of Remembrance and Hope program, including: Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Seventh Day Adventist, and many others. In addition, students who come from their own history of persecution (such as survivors of the Rwandan Genocide, First Nation students, African Americans, etc.) have also participated in the March of Remembrance and Hope.
From 2007 to 2011 the program was run annually in Canada for Canadian university students, by the
Canadian Centre for Diversity, with the cooperation of other organizations. In 2013, CCD transferred the program over to March of the Living Canada. The major funder of the Canadian program is the Azrieli Foundation, founded by Canadian Holocaust survivor, David Azrieli, which is a Canadian philanthropic organization that supports a wide range of initiatives and programs, among which include Holocaust commemoration and education.
The international MRH program is currently on hold, but there are American groups who have traveled with the Canadian delegation, namely Nazareth College and Hobart and William Smith Colleges. There is also an Austrian program by the same name for university students of diverse backgrounds that travels to Poland earlier during the year, during the March of the Living (MOL). In 2010, Nazareth College and Hobart and William Smith Colleges launched their own program called The March: Bearing Witness to Hope - http://morah.naz.edu/.
Two student organizations in Canada dedicated to teaching tolerance and combating genocide, "’Shout Canada "’ and "’Stand Canada "’, were founded by students who participated in Marches to Poland. Many of the student leaders and active members of these two organizations are alumni of the March of Remembrance and Hope program.
On January 27, 2007, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Ms. Marie Mirlande Noel, an African American student at the College of St. Elizabeth, and a graduate of the MRH program, addressed the United Nations about her experience on the March of Remembrance and Hope program.

Última muñeca

La última muñeca (Spanish for "the last doll") is a tradition of the "Quinceañera", the celebration of a girl's fifteenth birthday in parts of Latin America. During this ritual the "quinceañera" relinquishes a doll from her childhood to signify that she is no longer in need of such a toy. The ritual could also suggest that she is now capable of being a mother. The "chambalán de honor" is a person designated to "present her to society" and is usually the one to give her the "última muñeca" as well. The birthday girl will then dance with the doll as part of the ceremony. Some of the dolls used in the ceremony are made of elegant ceramic or porcelain and are hand painted. These collector’s dolls are highly sought after on the collector’s market.

<doc id="20123735" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20123735" title="Vethathiri Maharishi">
Vethathiri Maharishi

Yogiraj Shri Vethathiri Maharishi (1911–2006) was a spiritual leader and founder-trustee of the World Community Service Center in 1958 in Chennai. He founded over 300 yoga centres around the world and wrote about 80 books, many of which became academic textbooks. He was declared the 19th Siddha by the Dravidian University.
Birth.
Shri Vethathiri Maharishi was born in 1911 in the village of Guduvancheri, 30 km south of Chennai, India, into an indigent weaver’s family.
Early life.
After spending several years in various minor employments, he established a textile concern that grew to employ over 2,000 workers on a profit-sharing basis. Maharishi regularly participated in intense meditation and introspection, which he claims brought him full enlightenment at the age of thirty five. At the age of fifty, he closed his commercial ventures and devoted himself solely to spiritual service. However, he remained a “householder”, i.e. he did not break his family ties or take vows of renunciation, but rather lived in the indigenous Siddha tradition, maintaining family ties.
Poems and books.
Shri Vethathiri Maharishi wrote over 2000 poems on philosophical subjects. In the Indian philosophical tradition, his philosophy corresponds to pure advaita; it may be called pantheistic monism. His language and attitudes are contemporary, non-sectarian and non-dogmatic. He authored about 75 books in Tamil and English, and continued to write until his death.
Spiritual teachings.
Vethathiri strove to find answers to three questions: “What is God?” “What is life?” “Why is poverty in the world?” The search to find these answers as well as to further his lot in life led him into various fields of endeavor, including becoming a qualified practitioner of two systems of Indian indigenous medicine, Ayurveda and Siddha, and certified practitioner Homeopathy as well. Vethathiri led the life of a householder until he was 50, and then changed the course of his life from being a businessman to teach and write about his experiences of purported divine revelations. He published many books in English and Tamil. Between 1972-1993, he visited the USA, Europe, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Mexico.
Vethathiri's science of living (Vethathiriyam).
Vethathiri Maharishi’s claimed to synthesize a complete science of living for the betterment of humanity through: Simplified Kundalini Yoga meditation, Physical Exercises, Kaya Kalpa Yoga and Introspections. Vethathiri’s lifetime works are called Vethathiriyam, which literally translates as a roadmap to the mountain of knowledge. He claimed that a deep understanding of nature is essential for living in harmony with the law of nature, while balancing material well-being with spiritual progress.
Vethathiri that the primordial state of the universe, which he called Absolute Space, has two inherent attributes that are latent:
Organizations.
In 1958 Shri Vethathiri Maharishi founded the World Community Service Centre (WCSC), a non-profit registered society with a view to work towards World Peace through individual peace. As of today, more than 200 trusts and about 1000 meditation centers have been registered and affiliated to WCSC in India. From 1972 to 1993, he traveled abroad annually, lecturing and teaching extensively in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and U.S.A.
In 1984 he founded the “Vethathiri Maharishi Yoga and Kaya Kalpa Research Foundation” based in Aliyar, Pollachi, Tamil Nadu in the name of Arutperunjothi Nagar. This is located on Pollachi-Valparai Highway SH-78, next to Azhiyar Dam and State Transportation buses are available to Arutperunjothi Nagar from Pollachi. Facilities are provided for large groups to stay and undergo SKY courses of several days in duration. The Temple of Consciousness is the centerpiece of the campus.
In 1998 the Brain Trust was established to bring together intellectuals of various fields to discuss the issues facing mankind and work towards solutions for bringing about peace and harmony to the individual and to the world at large.
The Spiritual leader and founder-trustee of Aliyar based Temple of Consciousness died at an age of 95 on 28 March 2006. His embalmed body is now located in Mani Mandapam inside the World Community Service Center, Arutperunjothi Nagar, Azhiyar, Pollachi.
Stamp on Vethathiri Maharishi released.
Receiving from former Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology A. Raja the first copy of a commemorative postage stamp on Vethathiri Maharishi, the then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi said that the centenary celebrations and postage stamps on eminent persons and freedom fighters would help the youth to be inspired and emulate such personalities.
Talking about Vethathiri Maharishi, the former Chief Minister said ""The teachings of Vethathiri Maharishi (1911-2006) have been receiving acclaim because the spiritual leader possessed the “weapon” of rationalism. To attract people, the spiritual leader did not use magical powers or claim that he was in contact with god. As he had possessed rationalism that would help people to realise themselves, his teachings and messages were still adored."
Ramalinga Swamigal (1823–1874) and Vethathiri Maharishi were conscious of the influence of superstitions on people and they strove for showing the correct path, Mr. Karunanidhi said.
N. Mahalingam, industrialist and president of the Temple of Consciousness, Aliyar, recalled his relationship with Maharishi and said the World Community Service Centre founded by the spiritual leader was an outcome of the Satya Gnana Sabai of Adigal.

Saint Dymphna (album)

Saint Dymphna is the self-produced fourth studio album by American experimental music band Gang Gang Dance, released in 2008 by The Social Registry. It received positive reviews from critics.
Critical reception.
Media response to "Saint Dymphna" was generally positive; aggregating website Metacritic reported a normalised rating of 78% in October 2008 based on 27 critical reviews. Drowned in Sound's John Semple praised Gang Gang Dance's expansion of their sonic palette and noted that the album offers "genuine moments of hope and salvation amongst the unrest". Marc Masters of Pitchfork Media claimed that "the newfound clarity produces neither thinness nor tedium, but simply a direct, unadulterated power". Allmusic's Thom Jurek explained that the record is unique and the band's most fully realised project to date. These positive comments were encapsulated by Jody White of No Ripcord, who gave the album a maximum rating of ten out of ten by praising the band for a memorable album full of challenging and genre-defining sounds.
Slant's M. Clark gave "Saint Dymphna" a rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five, one of the lowest that it received from notable publications, and commented that Gang Gang Dance's energy "often falls flat and their eclecticism is more distracting than compelling". Maddy Costa of "The Guardian" also suggested that the album is eclectic, but gave it a favourable rating by concluding that it is "arranged with exquisite precision". Reed Fischer of "Paste" claimed that the record is "a dangerously sane blueprint for producers trying to capture what "futuristic" sounds like right now". "Saint Dymphna" figured highly in several end-of-year best album lists for 2008, notably, at number three by Cokemachineglow, at number five by "The Wire", at number nine by Tiny Mix Tapes, and at number 13 by Drowned in Sound. It was named Best Album Of 2008 by "FACT".

The book was a compilation of fanciful stories first written six years earlier for Ellen Emerson (daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson). The book was published in an edition of 1600 and though Alcott thought it "sold very well", she received only about $35 from the Boston publisher, George Briggs.

Direct corporate access

Direct Corporate Access (DCA) is part of the Faster Payments Service which provides a same day clearing payment service to UK member banks. Direct Corporate Access (DCA) will provide Banks' business customers with direct access to the Faster Payments Service (FPS) clearing service in a very similar way that Bacstel-IP provides access to BACS. 
Direct Corporate Access only enables submission of files of payments, however as the central FPS processes payments individually, VocaLink the operators of DCA will split the files into individual instructions for processing through FPS. 
It was developed by APACS on behalf of the FPS member banks and the infrastructure went live in March 2009. Barclays was the first Bank live for customer sponsorship in August 2009. 
Albany Software was the first solution supplier to successfully process a payment through the Faster Payments Service via DCA, using Albany ePAY on Wednesday 22 July 2009.
Secure-IP.
Secure-IP is a clone of the existing Bacstel-IP channel used for BACS. Files of payments are secured using a smart card or Hardware Security Module (HSM).
Files of payments submitted by Secure-IP will be disaggregated by VocaLink, the operators of DCA, and submitted into the Faster Payments Service. Disaggregation and acceptance may take up to 30 minutes and beneficiaries will receive access to the funds within 2 hours of acceptance.
The software used to access Secure-IP must be approved. This is an extension to the existing Bacs Approved Software Service (BASS). In March 2009 Albany Software and Bottomline Technologies Europe Ltd received approved status for their first DCA capable products. They were joined in May 2009 by Barron McCann. In 2010 they were joined by Direct Debit Ltd In 2011 they were joined by Fundtech.
Bureaux.
Bureau organisations can submit files of payments on behalf of other registered Service Users of Direct Corporate Access. 
The Bureau needs to be sponsored by a DCA enabled Bank (initially only Barclays) and to use a Bureau/DCA version of the approved Bacs Approved Software Service (BASS) software.
The Bureau's sponsor bank issues PKI certificates for authorising files in the form of a smart card or Hardware Security Module (HSM). The same PKI certificates can be used to authorise Bacs file submissions via Bacstel-IP. 
File submissions can only be made on behalf Service Users of a DCA enabled Bank (initially only Barclays).

Mary Broadfoot Walker

Mary Broadfoot Walker (1888–1974) was a British physician who first demonstrated the effectiveness of physostigmine in the treatment of the condition myasthenia gravis.
Biography.
Mary Walker was born at Croft-an-Righ, Wigtown, Scotland in 1888, one of four children and the daughter of a Judge. After school she trained in medicine at Glasgow & Edinburgh Medical College for Women, graduating with MBChB in 1913. During the First World War she served with the Royal Army Medical Corps at the 63rd General Hospital, Malta. In 1920 she became a salaried Assistant Medical Officer in "Poor Law Service" at St. Alfege's Hospital, Greenwich, London, where she worked until 1936. During this time she was awarded Membership of the Royal College of Physicians, London, in 1932. She then worked at St. Leonard's Hospital, Shoreditch, St. Francis' Hospital, Dulwich and St. Benedict's Hospital, Tooting, before retiring to Croft-an-Righ in 1954.
In 1934, while working at St. Alfege's Hospital, Dr. Walker discovered that the subcutaneous injection of physostigmine could temporarily reverse the muscle weakness found in patients suffering from myasthenia gravis. She had noted that the symptoms and signs of myasthenia were similar to those found in curare poisoning, and physostigmine was used as an antidote to curare poisoning at that time. The first case of myasthenia gravis successfully treated with physostigmine was published in "the Lancet" in June 1934.
In 1935 Mary Walker was the first to recognise the association between the condition familial periodic paralysis and hypokalaemia (low blood potassium levels). She also described the glucose challenge test used in diagnosing hypokalaemic periodic paralysis and the use of intravenous potassium in its treatment. During 1935 her research on myasthenia was incorporated into her MD thesis which was submitted via the University of Edinburgh, and for which she received a Gold Medal.
Although she never became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, she was awarded the Jean Hunter Prize in 1962 ""for the advancement of research into the treatment of nervous exhaustion and for her original contribution to the fundamental knowledge of the nature of myasthenia gravis, made while carrying out the routine duties of a medical officer at a large metropolitan hospital"."
After her retirement in 1954, she continued to work part time at the Glasgow Royal Maternity & Women's Hospital, and remained active in the field of myasthenia gravis. Her 1973 article also describes "the Mary Walker Effect", a clinical sign found in myasthenia gravis. She died in September 1974 at the age of 86.

Ahmadiyya views on evolution

The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam universally accept in principle the process of evolution, albeit divinely guided, and actively promotes it. Over the course of several decades the movement has issued various publications in support of the scientific concepts behind the process of evolution, and frequently engages in promoting how religious scripture supports the concept.
Views on Creationism and Intelligent Design.
Ahmadi Muslims do not take all the Quranic and Biblical creation narratives literally, but understand some of the passages metaphorically. Intelligent design models are also rejected as are certain aspects of Islamic creationism that some modernist religious bodies have postulated. Instead they propound the concept of "Guided Evolution" (analogous, or identical, to the doctrine of theistic evolution or evolutionary creationism held by almost all liberal Christians, and some others) which is demonstrated as being supported both by scriptural and scientific evidence. 
Ahmadis favor the perspective that the human race evolved out of the earth over a long period of time. The Qur'an teaches that man was created from the earth through a gradual evolutionary process in the following verses: 
“And He has created you in different stages and different forms ... And Allah has caused you to develop as a good growth from the earth. [Qur'an 71:14,17 
These verses illustrate that the creation of the human race was the culmination of a gradual evolutionary process and that it would be incorrect to say (as Creationism/Intelligent design suggests) that God formed the human being in an instant. Thus Ahmadis accept the concept of evolution in principle, but do not accept Darwinian evolution in all its details.
Adam and Eve.
Ahmadi Muslims also reject the creationist doctrine that Adam was the first human being on Earth, and proclaim that he was appointed as the first Prophet of God. This is supported by the verse of the Qur'an which refers to the appointment of a Representative of God on earth, rather than the creation of a new species, viz: 
[2:30] And when thy Lord said to the angels: ‘I am about to appoint a Vicegerent (Khalifa) in the earth,’ they said: ‘Wilt Thou place therein such as will cause disorder in it, and shed blood? — and we glorify Thee with Thy praise and extol Thy holiness.’ He answered: ‘I know what you know not.’
Ahmadis reason logically that the angels could only have questioned the appointment of a human being as a Prophet (Khalifa of God) because they had already witnessed disorder and bloodshed amongst the already existing humans. 
The story of Adam and Eve as given in the Bible is viewed by Ahmadis as being more of an account of religious history than a history of the entire human race. 
Belal Khalid, an Ahmadi scholar, clarified in his work, “Original Sin”:
“When the stage of the full development of the mental faculties of man was reached, God sent His revelation to the most perfect man of that generation, namely, Hadhrat Adam (as).
In short, the Quran teaches that man's physical creation and development are the result of a process of evolution and in the same way his intellectual development is also the result of a process of evolution. Hadhrat Adam (as) was not the first human being, but was the first human being whose intellect was capable of accepting and bearing the responsibility of revelation.”
Guided evolution.
Rather than adopting the Darwinist theory of unguided natural selection, Ahmadi Muslims promote the supposition of “guided evolution” as being part of the progressive design of God. As such they deny that natural selection occurred purely by chance, or merely by survival of the fittest – and view each stage of the evolutionary process as being selectively and continually woven to an intricate level by one creator (Allah). 
Furthermore illustrated with scientific theories and Quranic scripture, Ahmadis contend that the processes of life on Earth started from one single point of species (bacteria) with a mixture of water and a viscous clay-like substance. From the source of that one single organism, to the point of the first Prophet Adam (so the Ahmadiyya view) was a slow gradual evolutionary process that occurred over several stages (Lane). Each stage being of a variable timescale - perhaps over billions of years.
Proponents of Ahmadiyya consider that the notion of unguided 'natural selection' does not adequately explain how various species that have progressed from the lowest forms to the highest forms have solely depended upon occurrence of random mutations within the gene pool, or purely by the demands of environmental factors. In his book "Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge and Truth" (published 1998), Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the late leader of the Ahmadiyya movement, elaborated the complex mechanism of evolution as having been played more like strategic game of Chess than a game of Dice. Subsequently evolutionary processes could only have been guided by a vastly higher intelligence (God).
Creation of the Universe.
Similar to Theistic realism and the stance of modernist Islamic scholars, Ahmadis adopt a scientific cosmological approach to explaining the formation of universe initiated from the Big Bang and highlight how these theories relate with Quranic scripture. 
Some of the following verses for example, illustrate how certain aspects of modern scientific theory correspond with religious scripture:
“Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, 
then We clove them asunder and We created every living thing out of the water. 
Will they not then believe?”
21:30
"Then turned He to the heaven when it was smoke, 
and said unto it and unto the earth: 
Come both of you, willingly or loth. 
They said: We come, obedient."
41:11
“On the day when We will roll up heaven like the 
rolling up of the scroll for writings, 
as We originated the first creation, (so) We 
shall reproduce it; a promise (binding on Us); 
surely We will bring it about.”
21:104
Ahmadi's also explain these verses were written over 1400 years ago – long before mankind had reached any level of scientific insight. Thus modern science has recently uncovered proofs about the universe which contend with these verses, so this is indication that the verses were revealed from the God that created the universe.
Six individual phases of creation.
Furthermore, Ahmadis highlight several verses in the Quran where it mentions of "Six periods of creation" and use these verses to explain 
the theory that the universe began roughly 13 billion years ago. 
A single period, so the Ahmadi view, has no definitive timescale and could mean anywhere from 1 day to billions of years. 
“And, verily, We created the heavens 
and the Earth and all that is between 
them in six periods and no weariness 
touched Us.”
50:39
According to the Ahmadiyya view the universe passed from stage to stage till the Earth assumed a shape and developed properties which could sustain human life.
Extraterrestrial evolution.
Generally, Ahmadis believe that life is almost certainly not limited to planet Earth. The possibility of life having evolved on other planets is clearly established in the first chapter of the Qur'an which speaks of the plurality of worlds:
“All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of All the Worlds.”
1:2
The following verse corroborates this interpretation: 
"And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and of whatever living creatures (da'bbah) He has spread forth in both. And He has the power to gather them together when He will so please". [42:29] 
Ahmadis believe that any planet that contains the key ingredient of life—water—may also harbour life, as God has created all living things from water: 
We (God) created every living thing out of the water.
21:30

Tujh Sang Preet Lagai Sajna (Star Plus)

Tujh Sang Preet Lagai Sajna was an Indian soap opera broadcast on STAR Plus channel. The series premiered on November 3, 2008, replacing the long-running Indian soap opera Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii which was also created by Ekta Kapoor of Balaji Telefilms.
Story.
The show was criticesed for replacing Kahanii Ghar Ghar Kii, lets demand for season 2
Balwant and Vikram Aditya used to be best friends despite the fact that the latter was a land owner and the former was a farmer.
Their friendship was an example for everyone and they were inseparable until one horrible day. 
Balwant's daughter Simran was supposed to marry Vikaram Aditya's son Sumit. But it turned out that Sumit was already married (and had a son with his wife Bindya). Sumit hadn't told anyone.
On the day of his proposed marriage to Simran, Sumit runs away to get Bindiya and tells Vikram Aditya everything. Simran follows Sumit to tell him that she respects his decision and she doesn't want to marry him if he is already married. Simran is heartbroken as she has loved Sumit since her childhood but she swallows her pain in order to make him happy.
Balwant and Vikram Aditya reach the train station, where Simran and Sumit are standing. Due to a misunderstanding Vikram Aditya accidentally shoots Simran. In a fit of rage Balwant's son Kuldeep shoots Sumit. Kuldeep goes to jail and the families become sworn enemies. The village where they live gets divided into two parts and separated by a border which no one can cross. One either belongs to Kishangadh (Vikram Aditya's village) or Shantigadh (Balwant's village).
Sumit's son Yug (one year old at the time) is sent to London to study and stay away from the enmity in the village. Kuldeep's daughter Vrinda (born on the day of the shoot-out) is considered unlucky in the family by everyone except Balwant, as her father (Kuldeep) went to jail and her aunt (Simran) died the day she was born.
20 years after the incident.
Circumstances led to Yug and Vrinda—two people whose families are sworn enemies—to fall in love. After several unpleasant encounters, they fall deeply in love. Yug and Vrinda can't live without one another, and they plan to get married. That is when they find out about their families hating each other. They decide to get rid of the enmity by reminding Balwant and Vikram Aditya how they used to be such great friends. When that doesn't work, Yug comes to live at Vrinda's house pretending to be the best friend of Vrinda's cousin Teji. Nobody in the family, except for Vrinda and Teji, knows who Yug really is. He wins everyone's hearts and the family decides to get Yug and Vrinda married. That's when Balwant finds out who Yug really is. Yug and Vrinda run away. But they do not marry each other and come back within a day. They tell their families that they could have married if they wanted, and no one would have been able to do anything. They didn't because they truly love each other and want their marriage to happen with everyone's blessings. Balwant and Vikram Aditya are untouched and they drag Yug and Vrinda home. Before leaving Yug says to Balwant, "Vrinda meri amanat hai, jisse mein aapke paas chodke ja raha hoon. Par mein usse lene jaldi aonga." (I am leaving Vrinda with you for a short while and I will come back to get her as she is only mine.)
This makes Balwant and Vikram Aditya furious. They meet and make a plan to get Vrinda married to someone else in another village. But they tell Vrinda that she is getting married to Yug. Meanwhile Vikram Aditya sends Yug out on a business trip to London. Vrinda marries Rajbeer, who doesn't know about this plan. Yug finds out what happened and doesn't know what to do.
On the first night of marriage, Vrinda tells Rajbeer everything about her and Yug's love and their family's betrayal. She tells him that she thought she was marrying Yug and she cannot live with anyone else. Rajbeer (heartbroken) tells Vrinda that his grandmother is very ill and will only live about 6 months more. If Vrinda leaves Rajbeer, his grandmother will die right away. Vrinda agrees to stay in the house as Rajbeer's wife until his grandmother dies. Rajbeer promises that after 6 months, he will hand her over to Yug.
During these 6 months Vrinda and Rajbeer fall in love. But they don't admit it to each other because Rajbeer thinks Vrinda still loves Yug. She thinks that Rajbeer thinks of her only as a friend. On the day that his grandmother dies, Rajbeer gives Vrinda to Yug. But Yug tells them both that they belong together, as he used to see Vrinda's eyes filled with love for him but that love is now for Rajbeer and he doesn't want to get in the way of their happiness. Vrinda thanks Yug and leaves with Rajbeer. Seeing that they tore their children apart, Balwant and Vikram Aditya end their enmity and become best friends again. Yug still loves Vrinda deeply but marries Bharti byn his grandfather's wishes. Yug tells Bharti that they will only stay friends as he will always love Vrinda. Yug had told Bharti all this before marriage but she wanted to marry him anyway because she loved him a lot.
At first it is shown that Bharti is a really sweet and beautiful girl who loves Yug deeply even though she knows about him and Vrinda. It is later revealed that Bharti is extremely jealous of Vrinda. Bharti is plotting to ruin Vrinda's life.
Vrinda gets pregnant and Bharti convinces Rajbeer that the child belongs to Yug, by showing him some pictures that show Vrinda and Yug embracing. (The pictures were taken when Yug was consoling Vrinda). The baby dies at the age of only one month in a kidnapping attempt. Vrinda is devastated and Rajbeer is furious. He thinks Yug is the cause of everything. He thinks Yug and Vrinda are having an affair. Rajbeer declares enmity with Yug and says that if Vrinda keeps any relation with Yug, he will consider her dead. Vrinda, who loves Rajbeer a lot, agrees to not keep any relation with Yug.
Two months later, Vrinda gets pregnant for a second time. When Vrinda is coming back from the clinic after getting her medicine, she nearly gets hit by a truck and is saved by Yug. Rajbeer comes at that moment and he sees Vrinda in Yug's arms. He thinks that Vrinda has still been meeting Yug and that this child too belongs to Yug and not him. He kicks Vrinda out of the house.
Yug tries to explain things to Rajbeer but that doesn't work so he goes to Vrinda (who is at the train station) to apologise. But Vrinda screams at Yug saying that every time Yug comes into her life, something goes wrong and if he wants to see Vrinda happy he should never show his face to her again.
Yug goes home, heartbroken, and he hears Bharti talking on the phone. He finds out how she was the one who showed Rajbeer the pics and ruined Vrinda's life and Yug gets furious. He confronts Bharti and screams at her saying there is so much difference between her and Vrinda, because Vrinda thinks about everyone else and Bharti only thinks about herself. Bharti screams at Yug saying that she did everything because she loved him. She wanted Yug to notice her but all he thought about was Vrinda. They divorce each other and Bharti goes away from everyone's life. The show takes an 8 year's leap.
Eight years later.
Rajbeer is now a huge business man like Yug used to be. Yug is nearly on the street because he refuses to do any business. Yug holds himself responsible for ruining Vrinds's life and wants to die as soon as possible. Rajbeer wants to ruin Yug financially and it seems to be working until Virnda comes back into their lives with her 8-year-old daughter, named Tulsi. Vrinda tells Yug that he had nothing to do with ruining her life, in fact he was the only one who stood by her. Relieved from his guilt, Yug goes back into business and gets back on top.
Rajbeer finds Vrinda and makes a deal with her. If she supports him with a court case (Vrinda is the eye witness and her statement could make Rajbeer's nephew go to jail) he will let her live with him as his wife. Vrinda agrees. Initially Rajbeer hates Vrinda and tries to do everything that he could to make her life miserable but he starts to soften up slowly. Tulsi, with the help of her "Yug uncle" brings her parents close together. But Rajbeer finds out about this and he yells at Tulsi saying that Yug is her father not him. Tulsi is hurt but Yug explains to her that her dad is just angry and they have to pacify him. But Tulisi starts crying and asks why Rajbeer doesn't accept her as his daughter and why did he tell her that Yug was her dad. Vrinda hears this whole conversation, and she is heartbroken that Rajbeer hurt her daughter. She decides she can't live with someone who hates her daughter so much so she decides to leave Rajbeer's house and she moves in to an inidan colony.
At first Vrinda is happy living in the colony, but then some of the gossipy women of the colony start taunting Vrinda. They say that she has a daughter but no husband and that Tulsi is probably an illegitimate child, and that's why her dad doesn't come to see her. Vrinda is hurt by these comments and Tulsi is visibly disturbed by them. Vrinda decides that she will re-marry so that no one will taunt Tulsi again. Vrinda asks Yug to marry her! Yug, still in love with Vrinda, says yes. Rajbeer finds out about the marriage and although he is insanely jealous he acts as if he doesn't care.
After a series of drama and misunderstandings, on the day of Yug and Vrinda's wedding, Rajbeer finally finds out the truth about what Bharti did, and how Vrinda was never unfaithful to him. He goes to the temple where Yug and Vrinda are getting married and begs for Vrinda's forgiveness and asks her to come back to him. Vrinda has forgiven Rajbeer and wants to go back to him, but she doesn't say anything as she doesn't want to betray Yug (who accepted her and stood by her when no one else would). Rajbeer takes Vrinda's silence as her way of rejecting him and he is just about to leave when Yug stops him. Yug says that although Vrinda won't say anything to him, he loves her so much that he can even read her silence and he can always tell what she is thinking and what she wants. He puts Vrinda's hand in Rajbeer's, symbolizing that they will always be together. Rajbeer welcomes Vrinda back into his house (with a clear heart), and apologises to Yug. Yug and Rajbeer become best friends again and they join their companies and start doing business together. Yug becomes the huge business tycoon that he used to be again and life seems perfect. The sacred veil of the goddess in the temple flows over Yug and the girl as they stare in to each other's eyes. (This was exactly how Yug and Vrinda met for the first time.) Then they snap out of their eye lock and stand up straight. The girl introduces herself as Radha and Yug, mesemerised by her beauty (this is the first time Yug is mesmerised by anyone other than Vrinda) offers to drop her home. Radha accepts Yug's offer and gets in to his car. While getting in to the car, Radha almost falls and Yug catches her. The show ends with Radha in Yug's arms, indicating that this is the start of a new lovestory.
As the credits roll, Rajbeer and Vrinda are shown playing with two more kids. Yug and Radha are shown getting married and then cradling their newborn son in their arms. So basically everyone lives happily ever after.
Cast and characters.
Now Rajbeer and Vrinda have a daughter, Tulsi

Fusion – Sarvodaya ICT4D Movement

Fusion is the ICT (Information and Communications Technology) for Development (ICT4D) movement of Sarvodaya, Sri Lanka, the leading NGO, serving over 15,000 villages. The name Sarvodaya is taken from the Sanskrit meaning of 'awakening (udaya) of all (sarva)', and roots back to the Gandhian ideals. Fusion, as implied by the true meaning of the word, envisages the fusion of the vision and mission of Sarvodaya into the broader development scenario, using Information and Communication technologies (ICT) as a common fabric. Thus, Fusion is identified as the ICT for Development (ICT4D) movement of Sarvodaya.
Fusion primarily, but not exclusively, works with the villages that have already been socially and economically uplifted through diverse community development programs carried out over a period of time. Thus they are better prepared to connect with the information age. For instance a community having a registered society, with a healthy track record of micro-finance activities is recognized as better prepared to interact with digital technologies.
Fusion partners with multiple institutions including the State (Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka), corporate, academic and civil organizations.
Vision.
The project's vision is the e-Empowerment of rural poor communities.
Fusion's broader mission is founded on the following three pillars;
History.
The program builds on the pioneering telecenter, that has been trialled by the Social Empowerment Program of Sarvodaya, in 1997, at a remote township (Kahawatta) of Ratnapura District, Sri Lanka.
Since it started it has progressed through a remarkable learning curve;
Programs.
Village Information Centers (VIC).
Village Information Centers are simple community based libraries. Their unique features include:
VICs are initiated by the youth leaders (volunteers) of rural villages. They are housed within low cost rural buildings, donated by the community. Some are maintained adjoining Sarvodaya Village Banks.
VICs accumulate and manage basic livelihood information related to health, transport, agriculture, education and governance.
There are VICs having enormous indigenous resources such as Traditional Medical Recipes (on Ola leaves), Indigenous crop harvest equipment, Storage systems, Traditional songs and books. Some VICs gather information related to local bio-diversity (birds, plant species etc.).
Telecentres.
Telecentres are small units having a few computers and other ICT equipment located in rural districts. They provide internet access, ICT education and other IT services to rural communities.
The majority of the telecentres with which Fusion partners are owned by rural communities, (mostly sponsored by the State sponsored eSriLanka program). Fusion maintains a small network of telecentres to carry out pilot projects, the knowledge obtained from which can finally be adopted by the wider community.

Awre for Blakeney railway station is a closed railway station situated in Gloucestershire, England. As well as the village of Awre it served the town of Blakeney, Gloucestershire
History.
Opened by the South Wales Railway, the station was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway and this in turn was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948. From 1868, it was a junction for the freight-only Forest of Dean Central Railway, and it was sometimes shown in timetables as "Awre Junction". The Forest of Dean line closed in 1949, though it was used as a siding to store wagons for some years afterwards. Awre station was closed to passenger and goods traffic in 1959, though a coal depot remained open until 1961.

That Guy with the Glasses

That Guy with the Glasses is a website that primarily showcases satirical reviews of movies, television shows, popular music, comics and video games. It primarily features the work of Doug Walker, a Chicago-based comedian, writer, and film critic also known as "That Guy with the Glasses". In addition to Walker, the website also features videos from other producers. The founder and administrator of the site is Michael Michaud, CEO of the parent company Channel Awesome. The site was launched in April 2008 after the original videos were removed from YouTube following complaints of copyright infringement.
The website is home to several series, starring Douglas Walker and others. The main Walker series are "5 Second Movies" (hyper-edited feature films), "Nostalgia Critic" (scene-by-scene reviews of films and television, later including more recent movies as well), "Ask That Guy with the Glasses" (a comedy question and answer show) and "Bum Reviews" (humorous plot summaries of recently released feature films). Other videos and written articles are hosted on the site, including some minor series and sketches starring Walker. Videos are now hosted by blip.tv after problems with earlier provider Revver.
History.
Doug Walker's first appearance on the web was on the video website YouTube, in which he created satirical video reviews of films and other media entertainment of the past and present. Initially, Walker viewed making the videos as a side hobby, rarely interacting with his fans and did not even reveal his real name until a video responding to the Northern Illinois University shooting. The series drew complaints from major studios like 20th Century Fox and Lionsgate over alleged copyright infringement. This led to his video content being taken off the website. Walker attempted to re-upload his content by assigning each video a new, separate channel so that if one were deleted, the others would be left intact. However, due to continuing issues with YouTube, Walker decided to leave the website altogether and create the website "That Guy with the Glasses" with webmaster Mike Michaud. Michaud had created the sites' parent company, Channel Awesome, after he and two others were laid off from Circuit City in 2007. Michaud has stated, "If we didn't lose our jobs, business wouldn't have happened anytime soon."
The site was re-launched in April 2008, and all of Walker's future videos would only be posted there. In the following months, the site rapidly added new contributors and series. In December 2008, Walker appeared in a commercial for the PBS documentary "Make 'Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America", performing a series of brief imitations of famous comedians, from Charlie Chaplin to Stephen Colbert. In 2009, Doug and Rob Walker and Brian Heinz produced an iRiff of "The Lion King" for RiffTrax. In March 2009, the iRiff was chosen as the winner of the website's RiffTrax Presents contest. The performers received $1,000 and, with instruction from Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, recorded a commentary for the film "Batman Forever".
"The Nostalgia Critic" shows average 100,000 to 300,000 viewers per week, and the site as a whole receives 1 million page views per month. This is expected to increase following content-provider Blip.tv's deal with YouTube in July 2009. As of July 2009, the site earns more than $10,000 per month in advertising revenue and has received more than $11,000 in online donations, with the company expecting to earn $150,000 by the end of the year. In the third quarter of the 2009 Fiscal year, Walker's shows earned $53,000, including $32,000 from the Nostalgia Critic alone. This revenue was generated by run of network from Puma and Starburst. The success of his shows has allowed Walker to make a living performing and to quit his previous job as an illustrator, as well as pay the salary of co-founder/COO Mike Ellis.
Channel Awesome has plans to build on the success of "That Guy with the Glasses" with a network of new websites including "Bar Fiesta" (covering Chicago entertainment and nightlife), "Blistered Thumbs" (a spin off incorporating the current site's video game content) and "InkedReality" (anime, manga, and comic books). Michaud told the "Chicago Sun-Times" that he has 300 new show ideas in the works, intends to discover more performers like Walker, and has plans to increase revenue through sponsorships and merchandising.
On June 28, 2012, Channel Awesome content producers Doug Walker (The Nostalgia Critic), Lindsay Ellis (The Nostalgia Chick), and Todd Nathanson (Todd in the Shadows) signed exclusivity deals with Blip.tv, the video website which has directly hosted most TGWTG and Channel Awesome programming since they left Revver in 2008. The deal will not affect the appearance of the producers' videos on Channel Awesome's That Guy with the Glasses website, and would assist the increase of budget of the three series, as well as provide technical improvements. An extension of this deal is a Blip-run YouTube channel called "League of Super Critics" which features truncated versions of recent videos from the three producers.
Events.
First Anniversary: "That Guy With The Glasses Team Brawl".
On May 10, 2009, The Nostalgia Critic and the Angry Video Game Nerd starred in "TGWTG Team Brawl", which was filmed in Chicago, IL, and celebrated That Guy With the Glasses' first anniversary. Various personalities from both the Critic and Nerd's sites participated in a battle between the "Reviewers", led by the Critic, and "Gamers", led by the Nerd. "The Final Brawl" was created not only as a major cross-over video, but as a meet up for the contributors. One notable crossover video was a joint review with the Nostalgia Critic and Angry Video Game Nerd who reviewed a documentary about the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"' "Coming Out of their Shells" concert.
TGWTG Charity Donation Drive.
On December 5, 2009, Doug and Rob Walker, Noah Antwiler, Joe Vargas, Ed Glaser, Brian Heinz, Bhargav Dronamraju, Bennett White, and Victoria Turner hosted a live charity drive to raise money for the Ronald McDonald house charity. The drive was hosted on UStream, accepting donations through PayPal and offering incentives on the site such as premium memberships on the site, along with a phone call from Doug and company for any donations over $300. The drive started at 7:00 CST, and had raised over $20,000 by midnight. The drive ran for over 7 hours and ended with a grand total of $26,400. The second donation drive was held on December 5, 2010, ending with a grand total of $50,025.
Second Anniversary: "Kickassia".
A special marking the second anniversary of the site was filmed in the Republic of Molossia on April 9 through April 11, 2010. In addition to the site contributors, the video also features Molossia's President Kevin Baugh and his family playing parodies of themselves. The plot involves the site members invading Molossia, under the leadership of the Nostalgia Critic, renaming the micronation "Kickassia", before infighting instigated by the previous ruler who had infiltrated the Kickassian government in disguise, leads to the collapse of the new state and restoration of the previous government. A DVD of the special was released in October 2010.
The series was met with mixed to positive reception.
Third Anniversary: "Suburban Knights".
The third anniversary special of the site, entitled "Suburban Knights", aired in seven parts from June 27 to July 2 in 2011. The plot involves the reviewers going after "Malachite's Hand", a magic gauntlet hidden in suburban Illinois while cosplaying famous characters from fantasy films and video games. During their quest, they are opposed by a force of guardians that are protecting the gauntlet, and are pursued by Malachite, an ancient sorcerer who seeks the gauntlet to restore his powers and destroy the world of technology forever. Malachite overpowers the reviewers and briefly reclaims the gauntlet—which had been refashioned into a Nintendo Power Glove—but is defeated by Ma-Ti (a parody of Ma-Ti from "Captain Planet") through the power of heart. Ma-Ti is killed along with Malachite and the reviewers hold his funeral, parodying that of Spock in "".
The film was met with generally positive reception, citing a great storyline as the series' major strength.
Fourth Anniversary: "To Boldly Flee".
On June 27, 2012, a teaser trailer was released for the site's fourth anniversary special "To Boldly Flee", an 8-part, three-hour-plus science fiction parody film. A "final" trailer was released on August 16, 2012. The site's promotion of the special caused fan speculation about the possible end of the Nostalgia Critic series.
While Walker's intention was to officially end the show, it was kept as a secret from fans until after the premiere of Part 8, in which Walker confirmed, in a separate video, that the Nostalgia Critic regular series had reached its end (although he would later decide to bring back the show). The series finale of the Nostalgia Critic was a review of the 2002 film "Scooby-Doo", which parodied the series finale of "" and was selected by fans. Walker claimed that he had not retired the Nostalgia Critic entirely, as he would return in cameos for Linkara and the Nostalgia Chick.
Part 1 was released on August 23, 2012 with the other parts being released every three days thereafter. Combining elements of slapstick, black, meta, and referential humor, with in-jokes and callbacks to individual contributors' running sketches and gags (such as a lengthy sub-plot involving Linkara's archenemy clone Mechakara), it is a direct continuation of the "Suburban Knights" story, centering around a search across the solar system for the presumed-dead Ma-Ti and a mysterious space anomaly called the 'Plot Hole,' which spews out inconsistencies in time and logic, causing an imbalance. 
In the final episode, the Nostalgia Critic enters the real world through the hole and meets the Writer (Doug Walker), learning that he is in fact a fictitious character. After the hole merges with the universe, the Critic, too, merges with the hole to keep it stable, thus supplying an "in-universe" reason for his departure. The remaining TGWTG critics, having survived the merging and accepting the fact that they now reside within a literal mistake, celebrate their victory in That Guy with the Glasses' mansion.
The film parodies and pays homage to numerous works of science fiction, including "Star Wars", "Star Trek", "Judge Dredd", "Battlefield Earth", "Robocop", "Aliens", "The Terminator", "Superman II" and "The Matrix", among many others. The film also satirizes the Stop Online Piracy Act, internet censorship and the film industry in general. The title "To Boldly Flee" is itself a reference to a popular "Star Trek" phrase.
Fifth Year Anniversary: "The Uncanny Valley".
The teaser trailer for the fifth year anniversary special, entitled "The Uncanny Valley", was released on July 2, 2013, and the special itself was released in installments between July 23, 2013 and July 28, 2013. Taken as a whole, the special is an anthology film all written by several contributors of the site.
Overview.
The website That Guy with the Glasses features content from about 50 other producers aside from Doug Walker. The majority of the content is humorous reviews of various media and popular culture items, such as films, television series, comic books, anime, music, video games, food, and toys. However, there are several shows on the site which are neither reviews (such as Nash Bozard's "What the Fuck is Wrong with You?" and Stuart Ashen's "Ashens Tech Dump"), nor are intended to be primarily humorous (the majority of these are analytical-style review series, such as Leon Thomas' "Renegade Cut").
Channel Awesome contributors tend to vary in approach between humor and serious analysis, often representing a balance of the two. Contributors are generally known by their cybernyms, some even creating fictional personas when appearing in their videos.
Current long-running series.
Atop the Fourth Wall.
Lewis Lovhaug, aka "Linkara", hosts a series in which he reviews bad comic books. Of particular note are those by Rob Leifeld and Gary Brodsky, as well as Frank Miller after his prime. The series started on the site with "Top 15 WTF Moments in Comics" (November 29, 2008). Every November, Linkara reviews golden age and silver age comics in a segment he calls "Secret Origins Month". Another segment is "PSA Hell", in which he reviews public service announcement comics. In particular, May of 2010 was themed as "PSA Hell Month". Linkara is admittedly a "Pokémon" fan, "Star Trek" fan, conservative, "Doctor Who" fan, and feminist. He also hosts a show documenting the history of the Power Rangers, of which he is a major fan. Among his strong dislikes are the "Spider-Man" comic "" (which he reviewed for his 200th episode, despite saying years earlier that it was one of the comics he would never review), and 1990s artwork, particularly that of Youngblood, in which characters are meant to look edgier to the extent where it almost appears that the characters lack visible eyes (a style which he has come to label "Youngblood's disease"). On occasion, Linkara will upload live reviews from conventions. Linkara also briefly narrated a show known as "Comics in Five Panels", in which he summarized entire comic books into five panels.
The Blockbuster Buster.
E-Rod "The Blockbuster Buster" is a reviewer of bad, high-budget films in contrast to Nostalgia Critic's reviews of theatrical films regardless of budget. E-Rod has a major dislike of Michael Bay movies and is a major fan of the Darkwing Duck animated cartoon series. One major element of the show is E-Rod gaining his powers through a claw hammer, à la Mjölnir on Thor. In the original opening to his show, he is shown specifically attacking a VHS copy of . The original opening also begins with an "in a world" narration, in which he makes it apparent that he will "avenge the world of remakes and sequels".
Bad Movie Beatdown.
"Bad Movie Beatdown" is a series hosted by Mathew Buck (born December 1, 1990) from Swindon, United Kingdom as "Film Brain". The series serves as a means of reviewing movies that were considered outside the normal demographic of Walker's Nostalgia Critic. Buck primarily reviews action and science fiction films, as well as rip-offs; he less frequently reviews romantic comedies, the majority of which are from the 2000s (though he has reviewed some more obscure films from the 1980s/90s, primarily British or made-for-TV films) to avoid interfering with Walker's demographic. Buck primarily looks at his material with an immense attention to research, incorporating comments from actors or crew about their respective work. Like other reviewers, he has one theme month per year, which have included the films of Sylvester Stallone, Steven Seagal, Wesley Snipes, and prominent WWE wrestlers.
Brows Held High.
Kyle "Oancitizen" Kallgren is a reviewer of art house cinema. The first episode of "Brows Held High" on the site was "Shakespeare, Film and Kenneth Branagh - A Retrospective" (April 27, 2011). Kallgren takes a very analytical view of the films and finds the symbolism in many portions of the movies, though in a tongue-in-cheek manner that deconstructs the underlying pretensions of much of the films that he reviews. He is also known for his passion for literature and his style wherein his reviews sometimes reflect the nature of the film itself. Particularly notable examples are his review of "The Man Who Fell To Earth", where the script of the entire video is sung to the tune of several songs by David Bowie, who starred in the film; and his review of "Melancholia", where the film's exploration of depression is mirrored by the downward arc of the reviewer's on-camera mood and recovery.
Todd In The Shadows.
Todd Nathanson is a reviewer of pop music. His moniker comes from his character gimmick of always filming his episodes in the dark. As a result, his face is never seen, and in crossovers and public appearances he compensates for the brighter lighting by wearing a hoodie and partial face mask. Todd's review style tends to focus on analysis of the lyrics, often mocking them if they are ridiculous and/or badly constructed. While his reviews typically focus on the specific song in question rather than the artist's whole body of work, there are sometimes exceptions, such as his review of Chris Brown's "Turn Up The Music", which he purposefully derailed into an analysis over Brown's domestic violence incident, and the response by the media, Brown's fanbase, and Brown himself.
In addition to his reviews of current songs, Todd has another series called One-Hit Wonderland, where he looks over the career of the so-called "one-hit wonders" and gives his opinion about their famous song and if their artist deserves a second chance. He is in a relationship with Lindsay Ellis, who also reviews on TGWTG as "The Nostalgia Chick". This is parodied in their videos by depicting the Nostalgia Chick as an obsessed stalker of Todd, who refuses her advances and is himself an obsessed stalker of Obscurus Lupa, another female reviewer in the site.
Bum Reviews.
"Bum Reviews" features a crazy, drug-addicted homeless man named "Chester A. Bum" (portrayed by Walker) reviewing movies in an over-excited, random manner. Because he is so happy to be in a warm room, Chester likes every movie he sees regardless of its actual quality. The intro mocks such programs as "Masterpiece Theatre". The Bum begins all his reviews with "Oh my God, this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life!" and always ends by shouting "Change! Ya got change?!" while holding a styrofoam cup at the viewer. The first episode was "Speed Racer" (May 11, 2008). The character is portrayed as a hyperactive, drug-addicted tramp and cinema-goer. He was created after the Nostalgia Critic's review of "Cloverfield". Walker loved his impersonation of Hud from the film so much, that he used it as a basis for Chester, though the origins of the character came from Walker's review of "Transformers".
The Cinema Snob.
"The Cinema Snob" stars Brad Jones as a pretentious art critic who watches and comments on late 60's-early 90's obscure exploitation films and pornography. Like many other shows on "That Guy with the Glasses", Jones started his show on YouTube until he was confronted with a copyright claim from the filmmakers of "Nail Gun Massacre". The first episode on the site was "E.T. The Porno" (January 07, 2010).
A film adaptation, "The Cinema Snob Movie", directed by Ryan Mitchelle, was released on September 27, 2012. Brad also confirmed that the film will get a limited theatrical release.
Prior to the Cinema Snob, Brad Jones is also an independent filmmaker, whose independent films are on his site and TGWTG for viewing. As of December 2013 he is currently developing a new anthology movie called "Shot on Shitteo".
Nostalgia Chick.
The idea of a "Nostalgia Chick" to complement the existing "Nostalgia Critic" (Doug Walker) was announced on the "That Guy with the Glasses" website in "The Search for the Nostalgia Chick" (August 10, 2008). The idea was for a female host to review female-targeted nostalgic films and television. A contest generated the winner, Lindsay Ellis (born November 24, 1984). The first episode of her series was Disney's "Pocahontas" (September 16, 2008).
Originally her episodes followed a similar style as The Nostalgia Critic's, with Lindsay recapping the movie while making jokes and criticisms along the way, but her style eventually began to diverge. Lindsay eventually abandoned the recap style in favor of discussing the movie's themes and flaws out of plot order, and also brought along a supporting cast, consisting of her friends Antonella "Nella" Inserra, Elisa Hansen, and guest appearances from her boyfriend Todd "In The Shadows" Nathanson.
The costume of the Nostalgia Chick initially included a pair of glasses and a bow tie, but they stopped appearing on the show after they were stolen. The bow tie was left over from Ellis' appearance in a production of "Cabaret" while studying at New York University (she played the accordion). Early episodes included the closing catchphrase "I remember it because the dudes don't" (based on the Nostalgia Critic's "I remember it so you don't have to").
In 2013, the second part of Lindsay's review of "" was linked by Ian McKellen's Facebook page. Lindsay's review of "Matilda" also included the lead actress Mara Wilson herself, building off her previous appearance in the Critic's review of "A Simple Wish".
Nostalgia Critic.
The Nostalgia Critic is the most popular video series created by Walker, in which he plays the titular reviewer. The show is written by him and his brother Rob Walker. The series was initially launched on YouTube before moving to Blip TV. It is the flagship show for Channel Awesome, which has since built on it with additional content, additional websites and the spin-off show "Nostalgia Chick".
Notable former series.
5 Second Movies.
Walker is a figure in the "hyperediting" trend. Currently, "5 Second Movies" has had a total of 131 episodes. After the 101st episode, Walker said he will only make them if he thinks of a very funny idea, because he has almost run out of ideas and he does not want to run the series into the ground and grow stale.
The Spoony Experiment.
The Spoony Experiment (TSE) is a series starring by Noah Antwiler (born December 27, 1980) as "The Spoony One" or "Spoony". The series was hosted on both its own site of the same name, and "That Guy with the Glasses". The primary format of the series is humorous reviews of video games and movies. From 2010, it has also incorporated some games journalism at trade shows such as the Electronic Entertainment Expo. The mascot of the series is "Burton the Robot", a robot puppet made by Antwiler. On June 21, 2012, TGWTG.com announced Antwiler's intention to leave the site to pursue his own goals. He nevertheless remains on good terms with the producers of the websites and frequently collaborates with them.
Awards.
On January 6, 2011, Doug Walker was awarded Entrepreneur of the Year in Las Vegas at the 4th Annual Mashable Awards, Mashable Awards 2010.

Andrew Gray (senator)

Andrew Gray (died 1849) was a Democratic-Republican politician, a member of the Delaware Senate from 1817 to 1821. He was from Mill Creek Hundred, in New Castle County.
He was a trustee of the Academy of Newark, and in 1817 sponsored a bill to allow it to raise $50,000 by lottery in order to raise funds to establish a college. The lottery did not go ahead, and in January 1821 Gray sponsored a second bill to establish a college, as "Delaware College", to be funded by a tax on steamboats and stagecoaches. The prospect of these new taxes was exceptionally unpopular, and Gray was defeated by an anti-college "Independent Democratic" ticket in the 1821 elections by a 2-1 margin.
When Newark College was finally established in 1833, his three sons were sent there. He was appointed president of the trustees in 1839, succeeding Thomas Clayton, and was replaced by Eliphalet Wheeler Gilbert in April 1841. After being ousted as president, he sought an investigation of the fledgling college, accusing the trustees of financial mismanagement. On February 14, 1843, he presented a petition, stating that the college had been effectively taken over by the New School Presbyterians, and that it was heavily in debt. In order to allow it to survive into the future, he argued, it should be closed until the income from the endowment was sufficient to maintain it; otherwise, the endowment fund would quickly be spent on operating costs until there was nothing left. After some debate; his petition was rejected, and the college remained open.

Diana Saravia Olmos

Diana Saravia Olmos is a Uruguayan notary and political figure.
Background and previous political alliances.
While the National Party's Aparicio Saravia was a collateral family forbear, she is a former Deputy, and former supporter of 'Pachequismo' and subsequently the Ballistas within the Colorado Party (Uruguay). She was formerly seen as politically close to Jorge Pacheco Klein, who, however, left the country in 1998.
Current political alignment with Pedro Bordaberry Herrán.
In 2008 Saravia adhered to Pedro Bordaberry Herrán's 'Vamos Uruguay' grouping within the Colorado Party. Partly given her family background and her past association with 'Pachequismo', she is thus thought to add to the potential of 'Vamos Uruguay' to attract support beyond the Colorado Party's traditional electoral backers.

Raven (Ace Comics)

The Raven is a fictional superhero character who first appeared in the Ace Comics title "Sure-Fire Comics"; not to be confused with the DC Comics character.
He is based on the pulp hero "The Moon Man" published by Periodic House, the pulp publisher connected to Ace Comics.
Publication history.
The Raven first appeared in "Sure-Fire Comics" #1 (June, 1940), as did Lash Lightning.
In 2008, The Raven (now renamed Mr. Raven to avoid a trademark conflict with DC Comics) appeared in flashback in "Project Superpowers" #0; in the one-shot "Project Superpowers: Chapter Two Prelude", it’s stated that Mr. Raven will appear in this line as a member of a team called The Super-Mysterymen (presumably named after the Ace title "Super-Mystery Comics").
Fictional Biography.
Ace.
In 1940, New York City Detective Sergeant Danny Dartin, tired of seeing criminals manipulate the law to escape justice, became a masked vigilante called The Raven and acted as a modern “Robin Hood,” stealing money from criminals and redistributing it to the poor. He was aided in this by Lola Lash, the police chief’s daughter.
"Project Superpowers".
At some point after World War II, Mr. Raven was imprisoned in the mystical Urn of Pandora, along with many other crime-fighters, by the misguided Fighting Yank; decades later, the Urn was broken and the heroes freed. Mr. Raven, along with seven other heroes (including Captain Courageous, Lash Lightning and Lightning Girl, Soldier Unknown), and the Sword, was then recruited to form a team called The Super-Mysterymen, whose purpose is not yet known.
