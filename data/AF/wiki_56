Old Scores

Old Scores is a 1991 film jointly produced by New Zealand and Wales, based around the two countries' mutual national sport of rugby union. It is notable for the appearance of a large number of legendary Welsh and New Zealand international rugby players in supporting roles. "Old Scores" was primarily intended as theatrical release in New Zealand but was shown a television movie in Wales.
"Old Scores" was directed by Alan Clayton, and the screenplay was by New Zealanders Dean Parker and Greg McGee. McGee has a strong history of dramatic works revolving around rugby, most notably his play "Foreskin's Lament".
Plot.
"Old Scores" revolves around a controversial (fictional) rugby match between Wales and New Zealand which was won by Wales. On his death-bed, the touch judge confesses to failing to disallow the winning try for an infringement by the Welsh scorer. The Welsh Rugby Union President announces that in order to set the record straight, there should be a rematch between the two teams - using the same players who had played the match 25 years earlier.
The teams are forced to re-assemble, each bringing along not only their 25 years of unfitness, but also various skeletons in the closet - most notably the major falling-out between two of Wales's star players, Bleddyn Morgan and David Llewellyn, whose friendship had ended acrimoniously many years earlier. Morgan, had since moved to New Zealand, and initially refuses to play the match. It is later revealed that this is because of a love triangle which had developed between the two and Llewellyn's fiancée Bronwen. He is persuaded to play, for the sake of his country, but there is considerable acrimony between the two players which threatens to disrupt the team's performance.
The film is a blend of drama and comedy - the latter especially revolving around the efforts of the players to come to grips with both their middle-aged bodies and the changes in rugby since their time as international players (rugby was a totally amateur sport in 1966; by 1991 it had become big business). The New Zealand team are a rag-tag bunch whose later lives have taken them in different directions: the team's "hard man" has become a peace-loving Salvation Army officer, one of the team has become a vote-grabbing politician, yet another has become a homeless drunk. All are reassembled and put through their paces by their 1970s coach, "Acid" (a biting caricature by Martyn Sanderson of fabled All Blacks coach Fred Allen). The film culminates in the replayed game, played at Cardiff Arms Park. 
According to the Helen Martin and Sam Edwards' book "New Zealand Film 1912 - 1996": "The dialogue is witty and characterisations are fine, if deliberately overplayed, but the ending turns the film into a shaggy-dog story." The match ball is replaced by Wales's "lucky ball", an antique taken from the Welsh Rugby Museum by Price. With the scores tied, a shot is taken at goal, but the ancient leather of the ball is not strong enough and it deflates, landing limply on the crossbar where it remains. The final scene of the film shows an official review into the match deciding that it should be replayed again.
Cast.
The cast mixes a number of experienced NZ actors (including John Bach and the late Martyn Sanderson), with many rugby players from the 1960s and 70s taking supporting roles as members of the Welsh and New Zealand teams — the latter mostly in non-speaking parts. The players included New Zealand's Ian Kirkpatrick, Waka Nathan, Grahame Thorne, and Alex "Grizz" Wyllie, and Wales's Phil Bennett, Gerald Davies, Mervyn Davies, Gareth Edwards, Tony Faulkner, Dennis Hughes, Barry John, Allan Martin, David Morris, David Price, Mike Roberts, J.J. Williams, and Bobby Windsor. Despite the film's plot indicating that these were the teams from 1966, many of these players did not play international rugby until after this time.
1990s All Black Steve McDowell also appears (and acted as choreographer for the rugby match scenes), as does New Zealand rugby commentator Keith Quinn.

Vastly outnumbered, the Greek Spartans held up the Persians advance for three days, until they were overrun by Persian forces. The film also focuses on the lead up to the Battle of Thermopylae revealing that the Greeks might have played a part in the Ionian Revolts in Asia Minor in 499 to 493 B.C. It brings its viewers into understanding ancient warfare when the documentary focuses on the naval battle around Thermopylae, strategic & tactical considerations, and the aftermath of the battle which lead to the burning of Athens and Greek victories in battles such as Plataea. It also reveals to those unaware that the Spartans didn't fight alone.

Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management

Nova Scotia Archives is a governmental archival institution serving the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. The archives acquires, preserves and makes available the province's documentary heritage — recorded information of provincial significance created or accumulated by government and the private sector over the last 300 years.
The idea for a provincial archives and a Provincial Archivist first took root on April 30, 1857 when a resolution was put forward in the Legislative Assembly (moved by Joseph Howe, and seconded by James W. Johnston), making it the first provincial archives in Canada. Thomas Beamish Akins, a lawyer, historian, archivist, and author, was appointed Nova Scotia's first Commissioner of Public Records from 1857 until his death in 1891.
In 1931, the Nova Scotia Archives became the first provincial archives in Canada to have a purpose-built building. The Chase Building, designed by Andrew R. Cobb, still exists and is now home to the Math department of Dalhousie University. The current Public Archives Building opened in 1980 to provide additional vault space and allow for the storage of all archival records under one roof.
The department itself was formerly known as the "Public Archives of Nova Scotia" and was renamed Nova Scotia Archives & Records Management in 1997 after it assumed responsibility of government record-keeping. The former name is still used in certain applications, such as at the agency's headquarters at Robie Street and University Avenue in Halifax. It is a Division of the Department of Communities, Culture and Heritage. In 2011, the archives' official name changed to the Nova Scotia Archives.
The Nova Scotia Archives continues to digitize large parts of its collections for viewing on their website. Their website contains approximately 70 virtual exhibits and databases, and features thousands of archival photos and documents. Nova Scotia Historical Vital Statistics, the Nova Scotia Archives' genealogy website, contains birth, death, and marriage records from 1763 to 1958 with new accruals being added every year.
The Nova Scotia Archives is the home of the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society.

Professor G.R.Sharma was an eminent Historian from Allahabad University who led the Kausambi excavations which added to original historical research in the country. The ruins of this ancient city were found on the left bank of the river Yamuna, 70 km south-west from Allahabad. Thus commenced excavations of the site by the late Prof. G.R. Sharma of the Allahabad University in 1949 and again in 1951-1956. Following these excavations numerous remains of the ancient city came to light. He is among the historians who brought archeology in the mainstream of studying History.
Professor G.R. Sharma, had ventured to document archaeologically the destruction and burning of several settlements in the Ganges valley during the so-called invasion of the Indo-Greek king Menander (considered to be identical with Milinda of the Buddhist tradition) in the 2nd century BC.
Professor G.R.Sharma had also discovered (in 1967) a prehistoric site near Khajuri on the river Belan, a tributary of the river Tons, in the Meja sub-division of Allahabad district of Uttar Pradesh.

Dominique Lefèbvre

Dominique Lefèbvre (1810-1865) was a French missionary of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, Bishop of Isauropolis "in partibus infidelium", and Vicar Apostolic in Vietnam during the 19th century. His imprisonment in Vietnam was a pretext for the first French naval interventions in the country.
Dominique Lefèbvre arrived in Vietnam in 1835. At the time, it was illegal for missionaries to enter the country to proselytise. In 1845 Lefèbvre was condemned to death. The US Captain John Percival of the USS "Constitution" failed in his attempts to have him released, but managed to inform Admiral Jean-Baptiste Cécille who obtained his release.
Later Dominique Lefèbvre again re-entered Vietnam, and was again imprisoned. In 1847, Cécille sent two warships ("Gloire" and "Victorieuse") under Captains Lapierre and Rigault de Genouilly to Danang (Tourane) in Vietnam to obtain the liberation of two imprisoned French missionaries, Bishop Dominique Lefèbvre (imprisoned for a second time as he had re-entered Vietnam secretly) and Duclos, and freedom of worship for Catholics in Vietnam. As negotiations drew on without results, on April 15, 1847 a fight named the Bombardment of Đà Nẵng erupted between the French fleet and Vietnamese ships, three of them being sunk as a result. The French fleet then sailed away.
Dominique Lefèbvre died in Marseilles in 1865.

American flag rugby

American flag rugby (AFR) is a mixed-gender, non-contact version of rugby union and is a variant of the sport Tag Rugby. American flag rugby is designed for American children entering grades K–9. The organization itself exists to provide free start up kits and support to any community looking to add a youth rugby program to their community. The program has received great praise in the USA including an article in Rugby magazine and a spot on Fox Sports Net. The initial program from Morris County has helped create various other programs start up and now encompasses thousands of kids and adults across America participating in the youth sport and starting up programs.
Overview.
American flag rugby is divided up among four different levels based upon the grade level a child is entering. The four levels are:
Each division itself has a unique set of rules in recognition that there will be different ability levels between the various age groups. The game, while based on rugby union, is actually far more related to rugby sevens. Similarities are seen with the number of players on the field and the arrangement of the line-outs, scrums, and kick-offs. Like rugby union, games are played in halves but the halves are significantly reduced. The halves are the same for all four levels at 10 minutes each instead of 40 minutes each.
The rule differences between each division are minor and gradually shift closer towards rugby union rules as the child advances up in divisions and increases his or her skill set. For Owls the game typically revolves around teaching the chlidren to run with the ball, learning to touch the ball down when scoring a try, and learning basic passing skills. Nothing is contested, there is no kicking, and there are no conversions. However when children reach the Eagle level many of the prior mentioned restrictions are removed and the children play with contest, are allowed open field kicking, and the game has a more dynamic flow to it.
History.
The first iteration of American flag rugby was founded by Tom Feury in 1998. Feury was initially looking for nothing more than a way to get his children and their friends introduced to the game. In 1999 the town of Denville granted him access to a field in order to do so. The first year began with only one team and 28 children.

International Knockout Mouse Consortium

The International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) is a scientific endeavour to produce a collection of mouse embryonic stem cell lines that together lack every gene in the genome, and then to distribute the cells to scientific researchers to create knockout mice to study. Many of the targeted alleles are designed so that they can generate both complete and conditional gene knockout mice.
The IKMC was initiated on March 15, 2007 at a meeting in Brussels. By 2011, "Nature" reported that approximately 17,000 different genes have already been disabled by the consortium, "leaving only around 3,000 more to go."
The consortium encompasses four major, high-throughput gene-targeted mutagenesis programs: the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Knockout Mouse Program (KOMP) and state-funded Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine (TIGM) in the U.S., the North American Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis (NorCOMM) Program in Canada, and the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis (EUCOMM) Programme in Europe. The first of its annual meetings of members and funders, hosted by the country of its rotating chair, was held at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland in the United States for 2007–2008, with Toronto, Canada hosting for 2008-2009.

Lord of the Rings Adventure Game

Lord of the Rings Adventure Game is a role-playing game based on the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien (specifically "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Hobbit") under license from Tolkien Enterprises. Iron Crown Enterprises (I.C.E.) published the game until they lost the license on 22 Sep 1999.
Setting.
The setting for LOR is an expanded version of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. Published campaign sourcebooks are set just before the year 3018 of the Third Age, i.e. just before the War of the Ring. The Player Characters are able to interact with the main characters of the Lord of the Rings, but do not take direct roles in the outcome of those events.
System.
Originally published by Iron Crown Enterprises (I.C.E.) in 1991-1993, this was a simple, "level-less" roleplaying system designed to help introduce new players (and game masters) to roleplaying in the world of JRR Tolkien’s "The Hobbit" and "Lord of the Rings". It uses only two 6-sided dice to resolve skill checks and combat. It was an expansion of the even simpler rules used by ICE for its Middle-earth Quest books. It was intended as a stepping stone to I.C.E.’s more complex Middle-earth Role Playing (MERP) system and game modules.
Players can create characters from the races of Men, Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits and Half-elves.
Characters possess Attributes and Skills rated between -5 and +5. Skills can be modified to a rating above or below these limits (i.e. under -5 or over +5). An attack roll consists of a roll of 2D6, to which the attacker's skill rating and appropriate weapon rating are added and the defender's defense and armor rating are subtracted. The result is looked up on a table to determine success or failure, and if it is a success how much damage is done.
Spell casters can only learn a very limited number of spells. Some feel this is more in tune with the flavor of Tolkien's writings than other systems.
History.
The system’s first entry was a boxed set (ICE #LR0) containing the scenario "Dawn Comes Early" which also included guidelines, maps, character bios, and cardboard characters with stands. The next was the scenario book "Darker Than the Darkness" (ICE #LR1) and then the scenario book "Over the Misty Mountains Cold" (ICE #LR2). Two more scenario books in the series were planned but never published.
Two subsequent Middle-earth based role-playing games, "The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game" (2002) and "" (2011), were published respectively by Decipher Inc. and Cubicle 7. Except for the original source material, the Decipher and Cubicle 7 games share no link to ICE's "Lord of the Rings Adventure Game" and use entirely different rules systems.

<doc id="19983346" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19983346" title="Batona Trail">
Batona Trail

The Batona Trail is a hiking trail through New Jersey's Pine Barrens. The trail is the one of the longest in the state behind the Delaware and Raritan Canal Trail, the section of the Appalachian Trail within the state, the Liberty-Water Gap Trail, and the completed section of the Highlands Trail in the state. The trail begins in Brendan T. Byrne State Forest (formerly Lebanon State Forest) at the ghost town of Ong's Hat and traverses Wharton State Forest and Bass River State Forest. The trail was built in 1961 by the Batona Hiking Club, which began informally in 1928 when Philadelphians began meeting regularly to hike. It takes about three days to hike the whole trail.
History.
In 1960, Dale Knapschafer, suggested a trail be built linking Wharton and Lebanon State Forests. The next year, Batona Hiking Club president, Morris Bardock, contacted the Department of Conservation and Economic Development in New Jersey for permission to construct such a trail. After receiving permission from the state, Morris Bardock and Walter Korszniak made exploratory trips to figure out a route in the winter and spring of 1961 for the future trail. Through the help of volunteers, the first thirty miles of the trail were completed over the summer and the final pink blaze was painted on a tree near NJ 70 in Lebanon State Forest on September 16, 1961. Bardock chose pink blazes for the Batona Trail. The trail originally connected Carpenter Spring in Brendan T. Byrne State Forest (formerly Lebanon State Forest) and Batsto in Wharton State Forest. At this time Batsto (batstu meaning bath place in Swedish) was being developed by the state and continued to be inhabited by a few people. More recently the trail has been extended
In 2012 the trail was rerouted in two areas. The first was in Bass River State Forest which is the southernmost part of the trail. The second area is around Chatsworth. Both of the rerouted sections go through quieter areas and bypass paved roads and power lines where the trail originally ran. The Chatsworth section puts the trail through the northern section of the Franklin Parker Perserve. Both of these reroutings have added about 2 miles to the overall trail length.
Flora and fauna.
Although the Pine Barrens, as the name suggests, are mainly flat pine forests, there is a large variety of plants and animals along the trail. The pines that are found there include loblolly pine, white pine, pitch pine, shortleaf pines, and Virginia pines. Although the pines dominate the area there are also maple trees, birches, cedars, oaks, magnolia, and sassafras trees along the trail. There are a number of edible plants, such as bearberries, spotted wintergreen, teaberries, huckleberries, bayberries, blackberries, cranberries, blueberries, and strawberries. There is a diverse range of other plants, to include the prickly pear cactus, wildflowers, twenty-eight species of orchids, the pitcher plant, ferns, Atlantic white cedar, and sphagnum moss.
Thirty-nine species of mammals, two hundred and twenty-nine bird species, fifty-nine reptile and amphibian species and ninety-one fish species have been reported in the Pine Barrens. Possums, chipmunks, squirrels, beavers, muskrats, mice, foxes, raccoons, weasels, mink, river otter, and white-tailed deer are some of the more common mammals seen in the Pinelands. Some common amphibians and reptiles are snakes, skinks, newts, salamanders, frogs, toads, and turtles. The Pine Barrens Tree Frog has a population here that is disconnected from other populations in the Carolinas and the Florida Panhandle. The Pine Barrens location makes it the fringe of both northern and southern species, such as the Yellow Fringed Orchid.
Events.
The Annual Fall Endurance Walk on the Batona Trail is generally held on the first Sunday in November.
Brendan T. Byrne State Forest.
Byrne State Forest (formerly Lebanon State Forest) has more than of blazed trails, including its section of the Batona Trail. The system of trails includes trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, snow shoeing, mountain biking, and wheelchair accessible trails. The Batona trail in this park permits hiking, cross-country skiing, and snow shoeing. The Batona Trail intersects with other trails in the park, allowing visitors to create various loops for day hikes. The Batona Trail through Byrne State Forest is maintained by the State park Service and the Batona Hiking Club.
Wharton State Forest.
The portion of the Batona Trail through Wharton State Forest is maintained by the State Park Service and the Batona Hiking Club.
Carranza Memorial.
The Batona trail passes the Carranza memorial within Wharton State Forest. There is a monument dedicated to Captain Aviator Emilio Carranza, whose plane crashed here on July 13, 1928. Carranza was born in Mexico in 1905 and began flying at a young age, after fighting against the Yaqui in the Yaqui rebellion. At age 22, he made the third longest non-stop flight. Carranza crashed in the pinelands of Tabernacle, NJ, along what is now known as Carranza Road while returning from a good-will flight to the United States from Mexico. Every year a ceremony is held on July 13 to remember Emilio Carranza's life and achievements.
Bass River State Forest.
There is a system of eight additional trails in the state forest that connect to the Batona Trail. The Batona Trail through Bass River State Forest is maintained by the State Park Service, the Outdoor Club of South Jersey and the Batona Hiking Club.

Cardiff Locomotive Workshops

The Cardiff Locomotive Workshops were situated between Cockle Creek and Cardiff railway stations on the main Sydney to Newcastle railway line.
Early northern workshops.
The Hunter River Railway Company established meagre maintenance facilities adjacent to its line at its eastern terminus, near the current day Civic station. These formed the basis of the Honeysuckle Point Workshops the old buildings of which now lie within the area redeveloped by the Honeysuckle Development Corporation.
The workshops grew in size as the isolated Northern system developed. Even when the first Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge linked it with the Sydney in 1889, a bright future for the workshops was assured. However, by 1925 the decision had been taken to abandon Honeysuckle Point as a locomotive centre and to build a new workshop with modern facilities, on a site where greater expansion could take place.
Establishment.
In November 1925 172 acres (69.6ha) of land was purchased from the Newcastle Wallsend Coal Company and design of the new workshops began. The design was completed in time for work to start in the middle of 1926. The first sidings were connected to the main line in April, a platform for workers was in place by June and all sidings were completed by September of that year. Construction of the foundations for the buildings was well advanced by this time and erection of the steelwork started early the following year. By the end of 1927 the building work was virtually complete.
Machinery and tooling had been ordered early in 1927 and supplies began arriving throughout the year. Two 75-ton cranes were installed in the Erecting Shops. By early 1928, the first locomotives entered the facility and were under repair. The first locomotive to leave the workshops was 3364. The Annual Report of the New South Wales Government Railways to 30 June 1928, shows that by that date Cardiff Workshops had already overhauled 14 locomotives and repaired 15 boilers.
Official opening.
The official opening took place on 1 March 1928. By this time the facilities were fully functional. Honeysuckle Point was now a garage for Departmental motor vehicles and a permanent way workshop. A platform to serve the works was opened as Sulphide Junction.
As built, the Cardiff Workshops were a show-piece and were visited by engineers to see the form of construction and layout used. The building covered 150,725 square feet (14,000 m2). Central to the shop was a traverser. The traverser lined up with five inwards roads from which locomotives could be drawn and conveyed to any of 22 pits in the two erecting shops inside. Similarly, tenders and bogies for the tender shop made their way to the two roads provided via the traverser.
Other areas within the complex included blacksmith's and spring shop; machine, fitting and wheel shops; boiler shop and copper shop. The works manager's office, which included accommodation for his assistant and other clerical staff, was situated near the main line.
Locomotives overhauled and built new.
Initially, Cardiff Workshops took in locomotives used in the Newcastle district which included such classes as 30 class passenger tanks and 19, 24 and 26 classes used in coal haulage. Subsequently, the overhaul of the steam fleet was placed on a more formal basis and each of the three large workshops, Eveleigh, Chullora and Cardiff, each assumed a number of locomotive classes for each to overhaul. To Cardiff came the 34 and 35 passenger classes and the 53 and 55 freight classes.
Cardiff built the 12 odd number non-streamlined 38 class locomotives (3807–3829) between February 1946 and August 1949.
The order for the 58 class freight locomotives was also undertaken by NSWGR workshops. Cardiff built 5807 and 5813 with the latter the last steam locomotive to be built in a NSWGR workshop.
The war effort.
The hostilities of World War II imposed a heavy load on the industrial resources of Australia and most railway workshops were asked to play a part in the war effort. Cardiff was no exception. A large ammunition factory was built at Rutherford and many dies, tools and jigs were required for that facility. As a consequence, a Tool Room was built as an extension of the Smith and Machine Shops. At this time, the total staff employed at Cardiff was approximately 1,200.
Beyer Garratts.
In 1952 the 60 class Garratt locomotives entered service and facilities for their overhaul became a problem. Cardiff was selected to handle the overhauls, but the length of the locomotives at 109 feet (33.22 m) posed a problem as they were not going to fit on the traverser. The solution was found in partially filling in the traverser and lifting the locomotives into position with the overhead cranes.
Diesel era.
For several years, both diesel and steam locomotives were handled at Cardiff, but as initial numbers were not excessive, they were handled without too many problems. When steam locomotives ceased being overhauled in from 1970, a reorganisation was able to proceed.
An electrical fitting shop replaced the copper shop. The diesel engines were maintained where once boilers stood. Bogies were serviced and traction motors assembled on to wheels where the traverser once operated. The erecting shops retained that identity, but with additional platforms to enable work to be carried out at levels above the floor of the shops.
In 1986 control of Cardiff passed from the Workshop Branch to the Mechanical Branch and it became home depot to the 48 class fleet. This saw the traverser filled in for the Garratts in the 1950s reopened. A wagon repair section was also established.
Closure.
Two changes brought about the decline of the Cardiff Maintenance Centre, the name it adopted in March 1987. The first was the decision to maintain all wagons at a "One Spot" facility, a centre where freight rolling stock could receive all its necessary maintenance at one location. From April 1993 the wagon work was transferred to Port Waratah One Spot facility.
Locomotive work continued, but the second change soon followed. This was to hire a new fleet of locomotives under a "Power by the Hour" or "ReadyPower" agreement. Clyde Engineering was awarded the contract and constructed a depot on Kooragang#Kooragang Island to service the 82 and 90 class locomotives. Many older locomotives were retired with the last locomotives departing Cardiff Workshops in December 1993 with the gates closed on 7 January 1994.
As members of the 44, 442 and 45 classes were replaced by the new arrivals they were brought to Cardiff for store before being auctioned with 81 present in October 1994.
From 1994 to 1998 Cardiff was used as a worksite for the fitting of radios to all locomotives.
EDI Rail.
In June 1998 Downer Rail was successful in tendering to build a fleet of 140 electric suburban carriages, the Millennium Trains. Immediately after the tender was awarded, Downer Rail moved to prepare the old buildings for their new role. A seven-year lease with an option to buy the site was signed. As at August 2013 the Reliance Rail consortium, of which Downer Rail is a member, were in the process of assembling 626 A set carriages for Sydney Trains.
Downer have also assembled diesel locomotives at Cardiff with the underframes built at EDI's Port Augusta workshops. Locomotives built at Cardiff were:

<doc id="19983597" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19983597" title="Georgian National Communications Commission">
Georgian National Communications Commission

The Georgian National Communications Commission (GNCC) was established in 2000 as an independent regulatory body to license and oversee the operations of telecommunication and broadcasting companies within the national territory. The GNCC consists of 5 members, appointed by the President of Georgia and approved by Parliament. The Commission is fully independent and not subordinated to any state authorities.The budget is entirely funded through regulation fees paid by companies and telecom operators using the Georgian radiofrequency spectrum. The GNCC does not receive any funding from the state budget.
Core mandate and functions of the GNCC.
The establishment of the GNCC was deemed as an important step forward in strengthening the transparency and competition of the Georgian telecommunications sector, aimed at the protection of consumer interests and the provision of a fair, equitable, and predictable regulatory environment for market players.
The GNCC is the only authority in Georgia to issue and suspend licenses in electronic communications and broadcasting on the basis of the fair competition and auctions. The Commission monitors activities of licensees and their compliance with the terms of license. As a part of its monitoring functions, GNCC maintains and processes data on the operations of license holders. The GNCC monitors the compliance of the license holders with Georgia’s laws “On Broadcasting”, “on Copyright”, “on Protection of Minors From Harmful Influence”, “on Advertising” and “On State Secret”.
The GNCC is tasked with the definition and allocation of Georgia’s national radio frequency spectrum, certification of electronic communications and broadcasting facilities, standardization, provision of metrological services, etc. The GNCC controls and restricts unauthorized and unlicensed access and use of the radio frequencies and means of electronic communications in Georgia. In the event of unauthorized use of frequencies or communication facilities, the GNCC is responsible for the application and enforcement of penalties envisaged by the laws of Georgia.
Collaboration with international organizations.
To ensure compliance with its core mandate and goals, the GNCC closely collaborates with international organizations, institutions and unions such as the EBRD, CE, USAID, etc. In 2001, the GNCC became an Associate Member of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). In 2007, in accordance with the ETSI rules of procedure, the GNCC became a full Administration Member of ETSI. In February, 2005, Georgia joined the ICANN/GAC and became the 100th member of Governmental Advisory Committee of Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN/GAC). According to the decision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia GNCC represents the interests of Georgia in this Committee. In 2007, the group became a full member of European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT). GNCC closely collaborates with CEPT as the regulatory authority for telecommunications and broadcasting in Georgia.
The GNCC is a fully transparent public authority, whose operations information, management, and administrative procedures are open to public review.
Georgian National Communications Commission vs Megafon.
In a recent notable case, the GNCC has accused the Russian mobile telecommunications provider MegaFon of illegal, unlicensed business operations within Georgia’s national territory, as well as participation in the Russian military’s invasion of the country in August, 2008. In a press release, the GNCC has compared MegaFon’s operations in Georgia to “economic annexation.”*
The GNCC claims that the Mobile Communications Company registered in the Russian Federation, “MegaFon”, started its illegal operations back in 2005 in the conflict zones of Georgia, in particular–South Ossetia region. Using the Georgian radiofrequency bandwidth, the Russian company provided coverage mostly in the areas of dislocation of the Russian military forces (participating in the UNOMIG mission). The rest of the area was mostly covered by the Georgian Communication Companies “Geocell” Ltd. and “Magticom". In the spring of 2008, the GNCC received complaints from Georgian mobile phone carriers alleging destruction of their communication facilities and antennas in the region and installation of MefaFon antennas.
On June 5, 2008, the GNCC conducted a monitoring survey of the spectrum use in Zemo Nikozi, in the Tskhinvali region of South Ossetia. Representatives of the Monitoring Department of the Commission conducted tests to identify the users of GSM-900 spectrum radio frequencies. The technical results show that MegaFon is maintaining unlicensed network coverage in the area. Since 2005, MegaFon has conducted retail sales of SIM cards for consumer use within Georgia, as confirmed by the explanatory letters of local citizens using MegaFon services. Notably MegaFon never sought or received an authorization or license from the GNCC to operate in any part of Georgia.
On the basis of Administrative legislation of Georgia GNCC imposed two fines on MegaFon, the first–in the amount of 5000 GEL ($3,750.00 USD) in July 2008, and the second, for the recurrence of violation in the amount of 500,000 GEL (approx. $350,000.00 USD) in September 2008. GNCC transferred the files on violations, committed by MegaFon to the General Prosecutor of Georgia for initiating criminal proceedings against the key officials of MegaFon.
In August, 2008, during the Russian military intervention in Georgia, the company expanded the coverage area beyond the conflict zone. Namely, the coverage area now included the territory of the former Autonomous Province of South Ossetia and Gori and Kareli districts of Georgia. On September 16, due to the findings of the second monitoring mission of GNCC and establishing its extended coverage, “MegaFon” was fined with 500,000 GEL.On October 2 2008 Tbilisi City Court upheld the decision of GNCC and dismissed the claim of MegaFon, which was held liable for providing unlicensed telecommunication services in Georgia.
MegaFon’s appeal of the second administrative fine shall be discussed by Tbilisi City Court in November 2008.
The business news portal MediaGuide.ru reported that the Russian government asked MegaFon on August 14 to send a number of "base stations" to the so called South Ossetia to connect with systems in neighboring North Ossetia, part of the Russian Federation. The government stated that the signal for one of two existing South Ossetian communication networks, routed through Tbilisi, was "very weak" and had no "guaranteed stability." Once the stations were in place, MegaFon’s signal could be picked up as well in the neighboring Georgian town of Gori. GNCC declares that no Russian mobile communication company have been rooting any signal via Tbilisi, moreover, the separatist region does not have any “existing” communication networks. Therefore, the talks of expanded MegaFon coverage rather attempt to justify its illegal economic invasion in Georgia, whereas MegaFon itself has been and persisted to deny its operations in Georgia even in September. Numerous articles in Russian media, including Moscow Times publish declarations by the separatist leaders, in particular Aduard Kokoity on the long-awaited expansion of the MegaFon network and multiplying the number of customers to 36,000.

Phil Irving

Philip Edward Irving MBE, C.Eng., F.I.Mech.E., M.S.A.E., (1903–1992) was an Australian engineer and author, most famous for the Repco-Brabham Formula One and Vincent motorcycle engines. He also designed Velocette motorcycles and drew the engine of the 1960 EMC 125cc racer.
Irving's first engineering job started in 1922 working for the Australian engineer Anthony Michell at the firm of Crankless Engines Ltd in Fitzroy, Victoria. At the firm worked under both Michell and engineer T.L. Sherman. Irving said: "It was the greatest stroke of luck imaginable that I started work under two such eminent men...".
Between 1926 and 1929 Irving jointly owned and operated a motorcycle workshop in the regional town of Ballarat, Australia with Ken Granter. As the economic climate harshened in 1929 business at the shop slumped and it was forced to close. A historic plaque commemorates the former location of the workshop at 28 Doveton Street, Ballarat in Victoria.
In 1931, he left Australia and travelled to Britain as pillion passenger to John Gill on his Round-the-World motorcycle and sidecar journey. This epic trip was sponsored by the HRD-Vincent Company and on arrival in Britain, the pair travelled to Stevenage where Philip Vincent and Phil Irving commenced a lifelong friendship. Irving had two stints working for Vincent; in the early thirties and from 1943 when he worked at Stevenage as Vincent's Chief Engineer.
From 1937 to 1942 he worked for Velocette at their Hall Green Factory in Birmingham, where he designed and patented a number of designs including the famed rear suspension adjustment used on the post war spring-frame Velocettes. It was also used on the LE Velocette, a motorcycle he sketched during his war years at the company. Irving also designed the prototype Model 'O' Velocette, a shaft-drive twin cylinder machine of 600cc capacity and loosely based on the supercharged 500cc racing machine known as 'The Roarer'.
In 1942 he moved to London and worked with Joe Craig at Associated Motor Cycles Ltd at Plumstead.
In July 1943 Phillip Vincent wrote to him and invited him to return to the Vincent HRD company at Stevenage to develop the opposed piston two stroke engine to be fitted to the eleven man airborne lifeboat. He remained therer until 1949 when he returned home to Australia.
During the 1930s and 40s, Phil Irving wrote a technical column in Motor Cycling magazine under the pseudonym " 'Slide Rule' " some of which were later reprinted in book form as "Motorcycle Technicalities". Amongst the other books he authored are "Tuning For Speed", "Motorcycle Engineering" and his autobiography, "Phil Irving - An Autobiography".
At the 1960 Isle of Man TT Races, Dr Josef Ehrlich, the owner of Ehrlich Motor Cycles (EMC Motorcycles) commissioned Irving to 'reverse-engineer' an MZ 125cc racing engine supplied by Ehrlich and to produce the working drawings of a water-cooled variant which became the 1961 EMC 125cc water-cooled single cylinder racing engine.
At the end of 1963, Irving was approached by Jack Brabham to design a simple, lightweight and powerful 3 litre V8 engine for the upcoming change in Formula One engine specifications due for 1966. This engine was built around the 3.5 litre Oldsmobile V8 cylinder block design and became known as the RB620. It incorporated some 'off-the-'shelf' technology such as Vincent valve inspection caps and BSA 500cc Gold Star cam profiles. Jack Brabham won the 1966 Formula 1 Driver's Championship and the Manufacturers' Championship using this engine.
In 1949 Irving became Vice President of the Vincent HRD Owners Club and continued in that role until the death of Phil Vincent in 1979 when he rose to President (an honorary title). Irving held the presidency until his death on 14 January 1992.
Irving was awarded an MBE (Member of the British Empire) in the Queen's 1976 New Year Honours List for his "services to automotive engineering". His award was announced in the Supplement to The London Gazette dated 31 December 1976.
In later life, Irving permanently lived in Australia, basing himself at Warrandyte, on the outskirts of Melbourne where he had a small workshop. He never stopped his practical involvement with engines and especially with Vincent motorcycles. Just a few weeks before his death and aged 89 years, he was still working on Harley Davidson motorcycles at 'Midwest Harley' in Ballarat, Australia. Its owner Ken James said: "You can't stop Phil; he just needs to be around engines and make them sing".
Irving's life was devoted to his passion for Motorcycles and Motor Racing. An Australian company KH Equipment Pty. Ltd, continues to build and improve on the Vincent line under the name 'Irving Vincent' in Hallam, Victoria, Australia.
To honour Irving's 'great achievements', the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport named its highest engineering award the Phil Irving Award, one of the recipients is Ron Tauranac.
There is also a Phil Irving Trophy motorcycle race held at Phillip Island during its annual Island Classic race meeting.

General article

A general article, in military law (sometimes called "the Devil's Article") is a legal provision that authorizes punishment of military personnel on grounds that are less specific as to the particulars of the offense and as to the punishment, compared to most crimes in modern West European law. The offenses are likely to reflect the effect on the military and its mission than the form the offender's behavior takes, or to be stated in terms of established customs of warfare.
History.
The example of military decrees of the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus in the early 17th century was followed in West European military units, often in the form of articles of war including a general article.
United States.
American military law has evolved from British roots, including the offense of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman and, within each service, successive versions of general article that confer wide discretion upon courts martial.
Since 1951, Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) has been the general article for all branches of the military.
Article 134 is a "catch-all" for many offenses that are not covered by other specific articles of the UCMJ. These other offenses, including their elements and punishments, are spelled out in Part IV, Punitive Articles (Paragraphs 60-113) of the Manual for Courts-Martial. They vary from kidnapping (para. 92) to disloyal statements (para. 72).

The "Macedonian community of Brazil" refers to the group of ethnic Macedonians living in Brazil or their descendants.
An estimated 45,000 people in Brazil are of Slav Macedonian ancestry. The Slav Macedonians can be primarily found in Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Curitiba. Many of the descendants no longer speak the Macedonian language.
History.
Many Pečalbari (seasonal workers) came to Brazil in the early 1900s looking for work. Many of them stayed and established themselves in Brazil. A large wave of Aegean Macedonians came to Brazil in 1928. After World War Two another group of Macedonians came to Brazil. 
By 1947 Macedonian Migrants in all corners of the world had commenced an appeal to raise funds in an effort to assist the Macedonians in Macedonia to build hospitals and medical centres. This was coined the "Hospital Appeal". Brazilians of Macedonian descent helped to raise money for the hospitals. A total of $154,000 was raised by Macedonian migrants all over the world.

<doc id="19983742" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19983742" title="Observations and Measurements">
Observations and Measurements

Observations and Measurements (O&M) is an International Standard which defines a conceptual schema encoding for observations, and for features involved in sampling when making observations. While the O&M standard was developed in the context of geographic information systems, the model is derived from generic patterns proposed by Fowler and Odell, and is not limited to spatial information. O&M is one of the core standards in the OGC Sensor Web Enablement suite, providing the response model for Sensor Observation Service (SOS).
Observation Schema.
The core of the standard provides the Observation schema. An "observation" is an act that results in the estimation of the value of a feature property, and involves application of a specified procedure, such as a sensor, instrument, algorithm or process chain. The procedure may be applied in-situ, remotely, or ex-situ with respect to the sampling location. Use of a common model for observation metadata allows data to be combined unambiguously, across discipline boundaries. Observation details are also important for data discovery and for data quality estimation. An observation is defined in terms of the set of properties that support these applications.
O&M defines a core set of properties for an observation: 
The key to the model is the division of the observation and its feature of interest, separating the concerns so that the appropriate information associated with the description of each object. This allows a unified treatment of "in situ", "ex-situ", and remote-sensed observations. The observation schema may also be understood as a corollary of the General Feature Model from ISO 19101, providing metadata associated with the estimation of the value of a feature property. The Observation model takes a user-centric viewpoint, emphasizing the semantics of the feature-of-interest and its properties. This contrasts with sensor oriented models such as SensorML, which take a process- and thus provider-centric viewpoint.
Many observations are made to detect the variation of some property in the natural environment, expressed as a spatial function or "field", also known as a "coverage" (ISO 19123:2005). The relationship between observations, features and coverages is explained, in the context of ocean observations an modeling, in a report for GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot 3.
Sampling Features.
The standard also provides a schema for Sampling Features. Observations commonly involve sampling of the ultimate feature of interest. Specific sampling features, such as station, specimen, transect, section, are used in many application domains, and common processing and visualization tools are used. The standard defines a common set of sampling feature types classified primarily by spatial dimension, as well as samples for ex-situ observations. The schema includes relationships between sampling features (sub-sampling, derived samples).
The core properties of sampling features are:

Juan de Lebu

Juan de Lebú was a Moluche cacique or Ulmen of the Lebu region, captured by the Spanish sometime before 1568. He was sent to Peru and the Spaniards had baptized him with the name of Juan. He returned in 1568, with the new Governor Melchor Bravo de Saravia. When he had the chance he escaped and returned to his people to help them in the war against the Spanish Empire. Because he had become familiar with European tactics like Paineñamcu (Alonso Diaz), they became close collaborators in the war.
During Governor Rodrigo de Quiroga's first campaign in 1578, there was a raid that attempted to burn down the Spanish winter camp at Arauco. Juan de Lebú and seven other lonkos were captured in a retaliatory raid against the perpetrators by the Spanish under Rodrigo the nephew of Quiroga. To punish them as an example the seven lonkos were hanged from trees while Juan de Lebú suffered the same punishment as Caupolican, impalement.

Bicentennial Park South

Bicentennial Park South is a football (soccer) stadium in Rockdale, a suburb of Sydney in New South Wales, Australia. 
Redevelopment of the venue started in October 2008, and finished in September 2009 to become the new home of New South Wales Premier League team, the Rockdale City Suns.
History.
Bicentennial Park was opened in 1988. The football ground was opened to the general public as an idle soccer pitch. The ground was used as a local training ground for football, rugby league and athletics while holding matches by a local soccer team, the "Monterey Stingrays". In 2006, redevelopment plans were announced, relocating many sporting teams to Bicentennial Park and Scarborough Park grounds. The Rockdale Ilinden Football Club is a 21 year tenant of the new ground.
Re-Development.
Development work begun on Bicentennial Park South in October 2008 as part of the "Bicentennial and Scarborough Park Upgrade", including surface reconstruction for buildings to house change rooms and training rooms on the western hill and extended car park spaces. Stage 2 involves the installation of additional floodlights and a new grandstand seating area. The Rockdale Ilinden Football Club had originally announced the completion of the upgrade to be by March 2009 in time for the 2009 NSW Super League season, however various issues caused delays in the completion of the venue.
The stadium was eventually completed in September 2009 and was opened during the month of December, where the first football match was played with the home team Rockdale clashing with Preston Lions FC on 12 December. The first official NSW Premier League match was contested during the second round of the 2010 NSW Premier League season against fellow competition rivals Bankstown City Lions with Rockdale prevailing 1-0.
Bicentennial Park East.
Bicentennial Park East is a nearby park consisting of 3 football surfaces specifically designed for the use of junior football players. The development consisted of two large soccer fields and one small field. Cricket pitches have also be constructed in the centre of the two large fields for use in summer. Bicentennial Park East is accessible to the north and south via a footbridge, connecting senior and junior playing fields along with the main car parks. Geographically, Bicentennial Park East is located on the border of three suburbs, Monterey, Rockdale and Brighton-Le-Sands, but is officially in Brighton-Le-sands according to the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales.

Hverfjall

Hverfjall (also known as Hverfell) is a tephra cone or tuff ring volcano in northern Iceland, to the east of Mývatn. 
It erupted in 2500 BP in the southern part of the Krafla fissure swarm. The crater is approximately 1 km in diameter.
Tephra has been carried from Hverfjall all over the Lake Myvatn area. A landslide apparently occurred in the south part of the crater during the eruption, which accounts for the disruption to the round shape of the mountain. During the Age of Settlement, lava flowed from Svortuborgir, at the southern end of Namafjall, around Hverfjall, which was nearly engulfed by the lava. At the same time an eruption occurred in the slopes above the valley of Hlidardalur.
The rim of the crater is only accessible by two paths, from the northwest and south. It is strictly forbidden to use other routes in ascent or descent.

Ek Je Aachhe Kanya

Ek Je Aachhe Kanya (,The Girl ) is a Bengali movie released in 2001. Directed by Subrata Sen, the movie featured Konkona Sen Sharma, Sabyasachi Chakravarthy, Debashree Roy and Arjun Chakraborty. This movie is Konkona Sen Sharma's cinematic debut and directorial debut of Subrata Sen.
Plot.
Anjan works in advertising and has recently rented a room in a house in the suburbs of Calcutta. Eighteen-year-old Ria, who lives there with her grand father, falls in love with the new tenant. But Anjan already has a long-time girlfriend Rupa, who works with him in advertising. The rejected girl tries in vain to win Anjan’s favour. When she sees that her efforts are futile she starts to make trouble for the couple. At first her mischief is only minor, but it is followed by more serious threats to Anjan’s advertising project. And when the couple announces their engagement the girl becomes so enraged thet she tries to kill them. A year later Ria is released from a mental institution because the doctors believe her to be stable. Anjan and Rupa are married and have moved away. But a new tenant has moved into grandfather’s house… The film candidly reflects the culture degradation of the metropolitan environment, of traditional interpersonal relationships and points to the raising crime rate among young people.
There have been numerous movies made on the theme of a younger woman becoming infatuated with an older man. In that sense, 'Ek Je Aachhe Konya' isn't too different. Subrata Sen does a good job of directing and writing. He did his research well and tells his story in the modern city.Rupa, Anjan and Ria are people of modern Calcutta. They are sophisticated and smart. Anjan and Rupa work together respectively as creative head and photographer for an ad agency. While young Ria happens to be the granddaughter of new tenant Anjan's landlord. From the moment Ria sets eyes on Anjan, she develops an instant attraction and a strong liking. Though Anjan is slightly aware of this, he brushes it off as harmless. However, things start to go wrong when Rupa enters her picture.Debashree Roy does a decent job as Rupa. The actress has been working for years, hence she plays her part with ease. Sabyasachi Chakravarthy is alright. Finally Konkona Sen Sharma steals the show with her portrayal of the stubborn, obsessive and unexpectedly dangerous Ria. She is simply excellent and keeps surprising with her versatility.Thanks to Sen's writing, no time is wasted on unnecessary subplots as the focus is on the three 'protagonists'. However, 'Ek Je Aachhe Konya' bears a striking resemblance to The Crush (1993) that starred Alicia Silverstone. The film may not be a rip-off but some people find similarities between the two movies. The songs are beautiful. For Konkona fans, 'Ek Je Aachhe Konya' is not to be missed because you'll see her in a completely different shade.

<doc id="19983878" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19983878" title="BORO method">
BORO method

BORO is an approach to developing ontological or semantic models for large complex operational applications that consists of a top ontology and a process for constructing the ontology. It was originally developed as a method for mining ontologies from multiple legacy systems – as the first stage in an architectural transformation or software modernization. It has also been used to enable semantic interoperability between legacy systems. It is described in detail in (Partridge 1996, 2005). It is the analysis method used in the development and maintenance of the U.S. Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) Meta Model (DM2). Using BORO, a data modeling working group of over 350 members is able to systematically resolve a very broad spectrum of knowledge representation issues.
History.
The method was developed in the late 80's and early 90's by a team of KPMG consultants led by Chris Partridge. The team was working on a difficult legacy re-engineering project and needed a new approach. The prime challenge of the re-engineering was to clarify the underlying ontology of the systems, and the work focussed on developing a process for mining ontologies and a top ontology that formed the foundation for the analysis. The top ontology was tailored to meet the needs of the re-engineering. Early work established that a key factor was to make a series of clear metaphysical choices to provide a solid (metaphysical) foundation. A key choice was for an extensional (and hence, four-dimensional) ontology which provided neat criteria of identity. Using this top ontology as a basis, a systematic process for re-engineering legacy systems was developed. From a software engineering perspective, a key feature of this process was the identification of common general patterns, under which the legacy system was subsumed. It has been substantially developed since then. Much of this has been proprietary, but some has been in the public domain, and elements of it have appeared in a number of standards. For example, the ISO standard, ISO 15926 – Industrial automation systems and integration – was heavily influenced by an early version. The IDEAS (International Defence Enterprise Architecture Specification for exchange) standard is based upon BORO, which in turn was used to develop DODAF 2.0. From 2003 to 2008, the start-up company 42 Objects, funded by private equity company 3i worked on developing systems based upon BORO.
Description.
The BORO method is a simple, repeatable process for developing formal ontologies. The method takes an extensional approach to ontology development. The advantage of BORO over other methods is that its grounding in physical reality means that, if followed to the letter, the method will always produce the same ontology given the same inputs. This makes it particularly powerful for comparing multiple data-sources for semantic matches/mismatches and for re-engineering multiple legacy systems into a coherent whole (either as a new monolithic system, or as a method for designing federation of existing systems). Although BORO produces an ontology (information science) in the very strictest sense of the term, it does not produce the type of ontology (information science) that computer scientists would use for reasoning and inference. Instead, BORO's purpose is to improve the quality of information and information models, to integrate multiple information sources and extract hidden semantics.
The purpose of the method is to re-engineer disparate data sources into a common model. It is particularly good at semantic analysis – establishing whether two concepts are the same, if they overlap, or if they are unrelated. Traditional methods of data analysis tend to be linguistic; comparison of concepts is based on the names these concepts have. More modern methods have introduced a more semantic approach, where the analyst will tend to analyse the meaning behind a word. Although these methods tend to produce more accurate comparisons, a lot of it depends on the analyst’s domain knowledge and linguistic interpretation. 
BORO is different to many other data analysis techniques in that treats the names of things as a secondary concern. With BORO, the analyst is forced to identify individual concepts by their extent. In the case of physical objects, this is their spatial/temporal extent. For types of things, the extent is set of things that are of that type. The BORO methodology is best summarised as a flowchart:
As an example, take “Waterloo Bridge” as a concept. The first thing we ask is “does it have spatial and temporal extent ?”. It has spatial extent; it spans the River Thames. However, when we examine the temporal extent we realise there have been two bridges at that site. The first, built in 1817 (two years after the battle of Waterloo) was demolished in 1920. The bridge that stands there now was built in 1942. This analysis has immediately highlighted a problem with a name-based approach – there are two bridges of that name, which one are we referring to ? At this point, the analyst can add one or both of the bridges to the ontology, then apply the appropriate names to each.
The process also works for types of things. Take “bridges” as a concept. It doesn’t have spatiotemporal extent, so we go to the next question “does it have members ?”. It does – the members are all the bridges in the world. We then identify some exemplar members – e.g. Waterloo Bridge. At this stage, it is advisable to identify exemplars that are “on the edge” of the set – e.g. things that may or may not be bridges – e.g. pontoons, bridging vehicles, etc. so as to accurately identify the extent of the type.
The final concept covered by the process is the tuple. A tuple is a relationship between things. If the concept under analysis is neither a type nor an individual, then it must be a tuple. We identify the things at the end of the tuple then add it to the ontology.
Presentations.
The method has been presented several times, including a recent 2hr tutorial at the Integrated Enterprise Architecture Conference in London in 2008. It was also presented at the UK Ministry of Defence's EKIG conference in October 2009.

Novelas ejemplares

Exemplary Novels () is a series of twelve novellas that follow the model established in Italy. Written by Miguel de Cervantes between 1590 and 1612, the collection was published in Madrid in 1613 by Juan de la Cuesta, and received well in the wake of the first part of Don Quixote.
Cervantes boasted in his foreword to have been the first to write "novelas" in the Spanish language:
My genius and my inclination prompt me to this kind of writing; the more so as I consider (and with truth) that I am the first who has written novels in the Spanish language, though many have hitherto appeared among us, all of them translated from foreign authors. But these are my own, neither imitated nor stolen from anyone; my genius has engendered them, my pen has brought them forth, and they are growing up in the arms of the press.
The novellas are usually grouped into two series: those characterized by an idealized nature and those of a realistic nature. Those idealized in nature, which are the closest to the Italian models, are characterized by plots dealing with amorous entanglements, by improbable plots, by the presence of idealized characters and psychological development, and the low reflection of reality. They include: "El amante liberal", "Las dos doncellas", "La española inglesa", "La señora Cornelia" and "La fuerza de la sangre". The realistic in nature cater to the descriptions of realistic characters and environments, with intentional criticism in many cases. The realistic in nature are the best known stories: "Rinconete y Cortadillo", "El licenciado Vidriera", "La gitanilla", "El casamiento engañoso" (which leads directly into the fantasy "El coloquio de los perros"), and "La ilustre fregona". However, the separation between the two groups is not sharp and elements of the idealistic may be found in some of the realistic novels.
Since there are multiple versions of some of these stories, it is believed that Cervantes introduced some variations in these novels for moral, social and aesthetic purposes (hence the name 'exemplary'). The more primitive version is found in the manuscript called the "de Porras de la Cámara", a miscellaneous collection of various literary works which include a novel usually attributed to Cervantes, "La tía fingida". On the other hand, some short stories are also embedded in "Don Quixote", as "El curioso impertinente" or "Historia del cautivo" which have autobiographical elements. In addition, it alludes to another novel already composed, "Rinconete y Cortadillo".
Influence and adaptations.
Cervantes' novellas inspired several English Jacobean dramas, whose authors might have read them either in French translation or in the Spanish original. Plays based on the novellas include Beaumont and Fletcher's "Love's Pilgrimage" (adapted from "Las dos doncellas"), Fletcher's "The Chances" ("La Señora Cornelia"), Fletcher's "Rule a Wife and Have a Wife" ("El casamiento engañoso"), and Middleton's "The Spanish Gypsy" ("La fuerza de la sangre" and "La gitanilla"), among others.
The short stories.
The complete collection of "Exemplary Novels" is seldom published today, at least in English. There have been two paperback editions of the novellas over the past fifteen years, both entitled Exemplary Stories rather than novellas, but neither of them included all of the novellas.

Chris Dyer

Chris Dyer (born 12 February 1968) is the chief engineer of BMW's DTM programme and the former race engineer of Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen at the Ferrari Formula One team.
Early career.
Born in Bendigo, Victoria, Dyer worked with the top V8 Supercar outfit, the Tom Walkinshaw owned Holden Racing Team in the mid nineties alongside drivers such as Peter Brock and Craig Lowndes. In 1997, he switched to Walkinshaw's Formula One team Arrows, working as Damon Hill's chief data engineer. In 1998, he stepped up to race engineering, working with drivers such as Jos Verstappen.
Ferrari.
For the 2001 season, Dyer moved to Scuderia Ferrari, working as Michael Schumacher's vehicle engineer, alongside Luca Baldisserri. By the end of 2002, Dyer engineered Schumacher at the tests, and after the championships had been won, at the last three races at Monza, Indianapolis and Suzuka. Dyer then race engineered Michael Schumacher to his 2003 and 2004 world titles, appearing with the German on the podium after his triumph at the 2003 Canadian Grand Prix. Dyer was quoted saying that 'One of Michael’s strengths is that, apart from driving quickly, he has an understanding of the car and how all the systems work'.
Dyer then took over as Kimi Räikkönen's race engineer when the Finn moved to Ferrari in 2007. Despite suggestions that the pair didn't always get the most from the package, Räikkönen took the title in 2007 at the final race by a single point over Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso. However, after the disappointing results in the 2008 season, Ferrari announced that Dyer would be replaced by Andrea Stella for the 2009 season, with Dyer promoted to chief track engineer.
On 4 January 2011 Ferrari announced that Dyer was replaced as head of race track engineering by former McLaren engineer Pat Fry. This decision was taken after Dyer made the call to bring Fernando Alonso into the pits to cover off the Australian Mark Webber's pit stop in the final 2010 race, at Abu Dhabi. This decision was blamed for costing Alonso the drivers title, in favour of Sebastian Vettel who went on to become champion. In October 2012 it was announced that Dyer was to join BMW's DTM programme as chief engineer.

David Ellis (31 August 1736 – 1795) was a Welsh Anglican clergyman, poet and transcriber of manuscripts.
Life.
Ellis was born to Ellis and Elizabeth David, of Dolgellau, north Wales. After attending the school in Ystrad Meurig, he studied at Jesus College, Oxford, but only from March to June 1764. He was then ordained deacon (1764) and priest (1765), serving as curate in Llanberis, Llangeinwen, Derwen and Amlwch before his appointment as vicar of Llanberis in 1788. In the following year, he became vicar of Criccieth, holding the post until his death. In addition to his clerical duties, Ellis wrote poetry and translated works by others from English into Welsh. He also transcribed many Welsh manuscripts, some of which are now preserved in the National Library of Wales. His burial at Criccieth took place on 11 May 1795.

Melaleuca cuticularis

Melaleuca cuticularis, or Saltwater Paperbark is a native tree of Western Australia.
Description.
"M. cuticularis" is a tree that typically grows to a height of - and is fairly dense.
The leaves are linear to oblong, grey-green to dark green in colour and between and in length and to in width. The stems and trunk of "M. cuticularis" are covered in a pale papery bark and connect to rigid and torturous branches.
The flowers are brush shaped, cream in colour and located at the terminus of the branches. "M. cuticularis" flowers in spring between the months of September and January.
Fruits are woody and generally solitary with a star-like shape, they are to in width.
Distribution.
"M. cuticularis" is able to grow in saline wetlands such as swamps and estuaries. It is tolerant of both waterlogging and the presence of salt in the air and water. 
The tree is native to Western Australia and is located mostly in Coastal regions South of Perth stretching to Israelite Bay.
This species is ideal for sandy clay, loamy clay and clay soils and is commonly used for soil stabilisation and revegetation. It is also shade and drought tolerant so can be used in hedges or windbreaks.

Neophytos Doukas

"For other people with the surname Doukas/Dukas see Dukas (disambiguation)"
Neophytos Doukas or Dukas (; 1760, Ano Soudena, Ottoman Empire – 1845, northwestern Greece) was a Greek priest and scholar, author of a large number of books and translations from ancient Greek works, and one of the most important personalities of the modern Greek Enlightenment ("Diafotismos") during the Ottoman occupation of Greece. His contributions to Greek education have been neglected because of the traditional ideas he advocated concerning the Greek language question (supporting the use of Puristic Greek or Katharevousa).
Life.
Doukas was born in the village of Ano Soudena, in the mountainous Zagori region of Epirus, northwestern Greece. As a child he lived inside a monastic community and became a priest when he reached adulthood. He started his studies in Ioannina and Metsovo and then continued in Bucharest (Wallachia). His major interests were ancient Greek philosophy and literature as well as religious Greek and Latin documents. 
At 1803 he moved to Vienna and became one of the most significant personalities of the Greek community there, in which he lived for 12 years. His career as a teacher started in 1812 in Bucharest, when he became director of the Eponym School (Greek: Επώνυμη Σχολή). His teaching methods were so popular that the number of his students increased rapidly in a 6 months period: from 60 to 400. His work was recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. In 1820 he became a member of the Filiki Eteria organization. 
With the creation of the Greek independent state, he returned to Greece and undertook the administration of the orphanage of Egina, after being invited to do so by Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias. He made a donation of 11,000 books to the orphanage's library. In the same period, he became director of Rizarios Seminary (a religious institution of higher education) in Athens, but he died at the age of 85, before he could take up the duties of this position.
Work.
His significant educational and writing activity remained mostly unknown (until the late 20th century), mainly because of his conservative ideas and his promotion and use of the classical Greek language in education. He was accused by Adamantios Korais of being an "anti-philosopher". His contributions to Greek bibliography and to the Greek Enlightenment were, however, crucial. 
Among many other works (over 70 books), he edited a large number of ancient Greek authors, including Aristophanes, the "Bibliotheca", Homer, Pindar, Euripides, Sophocles.

Finnish language

Finnish (, or "suomen kieli") is the language spoken by the majority of the population in Finland and by ethnic Finns outside Finland. It is one of the two official languages of Finland and an official minority language in Sweden. In Sweden, both standard Finnish and Meänkieli, a Finnish dialect, are spoken. The Kven language, a dialect of Finnish, is spoken in Northern Norway.
Finnish is the eponymous member of the Finnic language family and is typologically between fusional and agglutinative languages. It modifies and inflects nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numerals and verbs, depending on their roles in the sentence.
Classification.
Finnish is a member of the Finnic group of the Uralic family of languages. The Finnic group also includes Estonian and a few minority languages spoken around the Baltic Sea.
Finnish demonstrates an affiliation with other Uralic languages in several respects including:
Several theories exist as to the geographic origin of Finnish and the other Uralic languages. The most widely held view is that they originated as a Proto-Uralic language somewhere in the boreal forest belt around the Ural Mountains region and/or the bend of the middle Volga. The strong case for Proto-Uralic is supported by common vocabulary with regularities in sound correspondences, as well as by the fact that the Uralic languages have many similarities in structure and grammar.
The Finns are more genetically similar to their Indo-European-speaking neighbours than to the speakers of the geographically close Uralic language Sami. It has been argued that a native Finnic-speaking population absorbed northward migrating Indo-European speakers who adopted the Finnic language, giving rise to the modern Finns.
The Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, classifies Finnish as a level III language (of 4 levels) in terms of learning difficulty for native English speakers.
Geographic distribution.
Finnish is spoken by about five million people who reside mainly in Finland. There are also notable Finnish-speaking minorities in Sweden, Norway, Russia, Estonia, Brazil, Canada, and the United States. The majority of the population of Finland, 90.37% , speak Finnish as their first language. The remainder speak Swedish (5.42%), Sami (Northern, Inari, Skolt) and other languages. It has achieved some popularity as a second language in Estonia.
Official status.
Finnish is one of two official languages of Finland (the other being Swedish, spoken by 5.42% of the population ) and an official language of the European Union. It enjoys the status of an official minority language in Sweden. Under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries speaking Finnish have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs.
History.
Prehistory.
The Finnic languages evolved from the Proto-Finnic language after Sámi was separated from it around 1500–1000 BCE. Current models assume three or more hypothetical Proto-Finnic proto-dialects evolving over the first millennium BCE.
Medieval period.
Prior to the Middle Ages, Finnish was an oral language. Even after, the language of larger-scale business was Middle Low German, the language of administration Swedish, and religious activities were held in Latin, leaving few possibilities for Finnish-speakers to use their mother tongue in situations other than daily chores.
The first known written example of Finnish comes from this era and was found in a German travel journal dating back to c.1450: "Mÿnna tachton gernast spuho somen gelen Emÿna daÿda" (Modern Finnish: "Minä tahdon kernaasti puhua suomen kieltä, en minä taida"; English: "I willingly want to speak Finnish, [but I am not able"). According to the travel journal, a Finnish bishop, whose name is unknown, was behind the above quotation. The contextually erroneous accusative case in "gelen" (Finnish "kielen") and the lack of the conjunction "mutta" seem to indicate a foreign speaker with an incomplete grasp of Finnish grammar, as errors with the numerous noun cases are typical of those learning Finnish. Finnish priestdom at the time was largely Swedish-speaking.
Writing system.
The first comprehensive writing system for Finnish was created by Mikael Agricola, a Finnish bishop, in the 16th century. He based his orthography on Swedish, German, and Latin. His ultimate plan was to translate the Bible, but first he had to define rules on which the Finnish standard language still relies, particularly with respect to spelling.
Agricola's written language was based on western dialects of Finnish, and his intention was that each phoneme should correspond to one letter. Yet, Agricola was confronted with many problems in this endeavour and failed to achieve uniformity. This is why he might use different signs for the same phonemes depending on the situation. For example he used "dh" or "d" to represent the voiced dental fricative (English "th" in "this") and "tz" or "z" to represent the geminate unvoiced dental fricative (the "th" in "thin"). Additionally, Agricola might use "gh" or "g" to represent the voiced velar fricative and either "ch", "c" or "h" for . For example he wrote "techtin" against modern spelling "tehtiin".
Later others revised Agricola's work, striving for a more phonemic system. Along the way, Finnish lost some of its phonemes. The sounds and disappeared from the standard language, surviving only in a small rural region in Western Finland. Elsewhere, traces of these phonemes persist as their disappearance gave Finnish dialects their distinct qualities. For example, became "ht" or "tt" (e.g. meþþä → mehtä, mettä) in the eastern dialects and in some western dialects. In the standard language, however, the effect of the lost phonemes is thus:
Modern Finnish punctuation, along with that of Swedish, uses the colon character to separate the stem of the word and its grammatical ending in some cases (such as after abbreviations), where some other alphabetic writing systems would use an apostrophe. Suffixes are required for correct grammar, so this is often applied, e.g. "EU:ssa" "in the EU".
Modernization.
In the 19th century Johan Vilhelm Snellman and others began to stress the need to improve the status of Finnish. Ever since the days of Mikael Agricola, written Finnish had been used almost exclusively in religious contexts, but now Snellman's Hegelian nationalistic ideas of Finnish as a full-fledged national language gained considerable support. Concerted efforts were made to improve the status of the language and to modernize it, and by the end of the century Finnish had become a language of administration, journalism, literature, and science in Finland, along with Swedish.
The most important contributions to improving the status of Finnish were made by Elias Lönnrot. His impact on the development of modern vocabulary in Finnish was particularly crucial. In addition to compiling the "Kalevala", he acted as an arbitrator in disputes about the development of standard Finnish between the proponents of western and eastern dialects, ensuring that the western dialects Agricola had preferred preserved their preeminent role, while many originally dialectical words from Eastern Finland were introduced to the standard language enriching it considerably. The first novel written in Finnish (and by a Finnish-speaker) was "Seven Brothers", published by Aleksis Kivi in 1870.
Dialects.
The dialects of Finnish are divided into two distinct groups, the Western dialects and the Eastern dialects. The dialects are almost entirely mutually intelligible and distinguished from each other by only minor changes in vowels, diphthongs and rhythm. For the most part, the dialects operate on the same phonology, grammar and vocabulary. There are only marginal examples of sounds or grammatical constructions specific to some dialect and not found in standard Finnish. Two examples are the voiced dental fricative found in Rauma dialect and the Eastern exessive case.
The classification of closely related dialects spoken outside Finland is a politically sensitive issue that has been controversial since Finland's independence in 1917. This concerns specifically the Karelian language in Russia and Meänkieli in Sweden, the speakers of which are often considered oppressed minorities. Karelian is different enough from standard Finnish to have its own orthography. Meänkieli is a northern dialect entirely intelligible to speakers of any other Finnish dialect, which achieved its status as an official minority language in Sweden for historical and political reasons regardless of the fact that Finnish is an official minority language in Sweden, too.
Western dialects.
The South-West dialects "(lounaismurteet)" are spoken in Finland Proper and Satakunta. Their typical feature is abbreviation of word-final vowels, and in many respects they resemble Estonian. The Tavastian dialects "(hämäläismurteet)" are spoken in Tavastia. They are closest to the standard language, but feature some slight vowel changes, such as the opening of diphthong-final vowels ("tie → tiä", "miekka → miakka", "kuolisi → kualis"). The Southern Ostrobothnian dialects "(eteläpohjalaiset murteet)" are spoken in Southern Ostrobothnia. Their most notable feature is the pronunciation of 'd' as a tapped or even fully trilled . The Middle and North Ostrobothnia dialects "(keski- ja pohjoispohjalaiset murteet)" are spoken in Central and Northern Ostrobothnia. The Far-Northern dialects "(peräpohjalaiset murteet)" are spoken in Lapland. The dialects spoken in the western parts of Lapland are recognizable by retention of old 'h' sounds in positions where they have disappeared from other dialects.
One of the Far-Northern dialects, Meänkieli, which is spoken on the Swedish side of the border, is taught in some Swedish schools as a distinct standardized language. The speakers of Meänkieli became politically separated from the other Finns when Finland was annexed to Russia in 1809. The categorization of Meänkieli as a separate language is controversial among the Finns, who see no linguistic criteria, only political reasons, for treating Meänkieli differently to other dialects of Finnish.
The Kven language is spoken in Finnmark and Troms, in Norway. Its speakers are descendants of Finnish emigrants to the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. Kven is an official minority language in Norway.
Eastern dialects.
The Eastern dialects consist of the widespread Savonian dialects "(savolaismurteet)" spoken in Savo and nearby areas, and the South-Eastern dialects spoken now only in Finnish South Karelia. The South-Eastern dialects "(kaakkoismurteet)" were previously spoken also on the Karelian Isthmus and in Ingria. The Karelian Isthmus was evacuated during World War II and refugees were resettled all over Finland. Most Ingrian Finns were deported to various parts of Russia and Estonia.
Palatalization, a common feature of Uralic languages, had been lost in Finnic languages, but it has been reacquired by most of these languages, including Eastern Finnish, but not Western Finnish. In Finnish orthography, this is denoted with a 'j', e.g. "vesj", cf. standard "vesi".
The language spoken in the parts of Karelia that have not historically been under Swedish or Finnish rule is usually called the Karelian language, and it is considered to be more distant from standard Finnish than the Eastern dialects. Whether this language of Russian Karelia is a dialect of Finnish or a separate language is a matter of interpretation. However, the term "Karelian dialects" is often used colloquially for the Finnish South-Eastern dialects.
Linguistic varieties.
There are two main varieties of Finnish used throughout the country. One is the "standard language" ("yleiskieli"), and the other is the "spoken language" ("puhekieli"). The standard language is used in formal situations like political speeches and newscasts. Its written form, the "book language" ("kirjakieli"), is used in nearly all written texts, not always excluding even the dialogue of common people in popular prose. The spoken language, on the other hand, is the main variety of Finnish used in popular TV and radio shows and at workplaces, and may be preferred to a dialect in personal communication.
Standardization.
Standard Finnish is prescribed by the Language Office of the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland and is the language used in official communication. The Dictionary of Contemporary Finnish ("Nykysuomen sanakirja" 1951–61), with 201,000 entries, was a prescriptive dictionary that defined official language. An additional volume for words of foreign origin ("Nykysuomen sivistyssanakirja", 30,000 entries) was published in 1991. An updated dictionary, The New Dictionary of Modern Finnish ("Kielitoimiston sanakirja") was published in an electronic form in 2004 and in print in 2006. A descriptive grammar ("Iso suomen kielioppi", 1,600 pages) was published in 2004. There is also an etymological dictionary, "Suomen sanojen alkuperä", published in 1992–2000, and a handbook of contemporary language ("Nykysuomen käsikirja"), and a periodic publication, "Kielikello". Standard Finnish is used in official texts and is the form of language taught in schools. Its spoken form is used in political speech, newscasts, in courts, and in other formal situations. Nearly all publishing and printed works are in standard Finnish.
Spoken Finnish.
The spoken language has mostly developed naturally from earlier forms of Finnish, and spread from main cultural and political centres. The standard language, however, has always been a consciously constructed medium for literature. It preserves grammatical patterns that have mostly vanished from the colloquial varieties and, as its main application is writing, it features complex syntactic patterns that are not easy to handle when used in speech. The spoken language develops significantly faster, and the grammatical and phonological simplifications include also the most common pronouns and suffixes, which sum up to frequent but modest differences. Some sound changes have been left out of the formal language, such as the irregularization of some common verbs by assimilation, e.g. "tule-" → "tuu-" ('come', only when the second syllable is short, so the third person singular does not contract: "hän tulee" 'he comes', never *"hän tuu"; also "mene-" → "mee-"). However, the longer forms such as "tule" can be used in spoken language in other forms as well.
Written language certainly still exerts a considerable influence upon the spoken word, because illiteracy is nonexistent and many Finns are avid readers. In fact, it is still not entirely uncommon to meet people who "talk book-ish" ("puhuvat kirjakieltä"); it may have a connotation of pedantry, exaggeration, moderation, weaseling or sarcasm (somewhat like a heavy use of Latinate words in English). More common is the intrusion of typically literary constructions into a colloquial discourse, as a kind of quote from written Finnish. It should also be noted that it is quite common to hear book-like and polished speech on radio or TV, and the constant exposure to such language tends to lead to the adoption of such constructions even in everyday language.
A prominent example of the effect of the standard language is the development of the consonant gradation form /ts : ts/ as in "metsä : metsän", as this pattern was originally (1940) found natively only in the dialects of southern Karelian isthmus and Ingria. It has been reinforced by the spelling 'ts' for the dental fricative , used earlier in some western dialects. The spelling and the pronunciation encouraged by it however approximate the original pronunciation, still reflected e.g. in Karelian /čč : č/ ("meččä : mečän"). In spoken language, a fusion of Western /tt : tt/ ("mettä : mettän") and Eastern /ht : t/ ("mehtä : metän") has been created: /tt : t/ ("mettä : metän"). It is notable that neither of these forms are identifiable as, or originate from, a specific dialect.
The orthography of the informal language follows that of the formal language. However, sometimes sandhi may be transcribed, especially the internal ones, e.g. "menenpä" → "menempä". This never takes place in formal language.
Examples.
Note that there are noticeable differences between dialects. Also note that here the formal language does not mean a language spoken in formal occasions but the standard language which exists practically only in written form.
Phonology.
Characteristic features of Finnish (common to some other Uralic languages) are vowel harmony and an agglutinative morphology; owing to the extensive use of the latter, words can be quite long.
The main stress is always on the first syllable, and it is articulated by adding approximately 100 ms more length to the stressed vowel. Stress does not cause any measurable modifications in vowel quality (very much unlike English). However, stress is not strong and words appear evenly stressed. In some cases, stress is so weak that the highest points of volume, pitch and other indicators of "articulation intensity" are not on the first syllable, although native speakers recognize the first syllable as a stressed syllable.
There are eight vowels, whose lexical and grammatical role is highly important, and which are unusually strictly controlled, so that there is almost no allophony. Vowels shown in the table below, followed by the IPA symbol. These are always different phonemes in the initial syllable; for noninitial syllable, see morphophonology below. There is no close-mid/open-mid distinction, with true mid or open-mid being used in all cases.
The usual analysis is that Finnish has long and short vowels and consonants as distinct phonemes. However, long vowels may be analyzed as a vowel followed by a chroneme, or also, that sequences of identical vowels are pronounced as "diphthongs". The quality of long vowels mostly overlaps with the quality of short vowels, with the exception of u, which is centralized with respect to uu; long vowels do not morph into diphthongs. There are eighteen phonemic diphthongs; like vowels, diphthongs do not have significant allophony.
Finnish has a consonant inventory of small to moderate size, where voicing is mostly not distinctive, and fricatives are scarce. Finnish has relatively few non-coronal consonants. Consonants are as follows, where consonants in parenthesis are found only in a few recent loans.
Almost all consonants have phonemic geminated forms. These are independent, but occur only medially when phonemic.
Independent consonant clusters are not allowed in native words, except for a small set of two-consonant syllable codas, e.g. 'rs' in "karsta". However, because of a number of recently adopted loanwords using them, e.g. "strutsi" from Swedish "struts", meaning "ostrich", Finnish speakers can pronounce them, even if it is somewhat awkward.
As a Uralic language, it is somewhat special in two respects: loss of fricatives and loss of palatalization. Finnish has only two fricatives in native words, namely and . All other fricatives are recognized as foreign, of which Finnish speakers can usually reliably distinguish and . (The official alphabet includes 'z' and 'ž' [ʒ, but these are rarely used correctly, including by the Swedish-speakers.) Palatalization is characteristic of Uralic languages, but Finnish has lost it. However, the Eastern dialects and the Karelian language have redeveloped a system of palatalization. For example, the Karelian word "d'uuri" , with a palatalized , is reflected by "juuri" in Finnish and Savo dialect "vesj" is "vesi" in standard Finnish.
A feature of Finnic phonology is the development of labial and rounded vowels in non-initial syllables, as in the word "tyttö". Proto-Uralic had only 'a' and 'i' and their vowel harmonic allophones in non-initial syllables; modern Finnish allows other vowels in non-initial syllables, although they are uncommon compared to 'a', 'ä' and 'i'.
Morphophonology.
Finnish has several morphophonological processes that require modification of the forms of words for daily speech. The most important processes are vowel harmony and consonant gradation.
Vowel harmony is a redundancy feature, which means that the feature [±back] is uniform within a word, and so it is necessary to interpret it only once for a given word. It is meaning-distinguishing in the initial syllable, and suffixes follow; so, if the listener hears [±back] in any part of the word, they can derive [±back] for the initial syllable. For example, from the stem "tuote" ("product") one derives "tuotteeseensa" ("into his product"), where the final vowel becomes the back vowel 'a' (rather than the front vowel 'ä') because the initial syllable contains the back vowels 'uo'. This is especially notable because vowels 'a' and 'ä' are different, meaning-distinguishing phonemes, not interchangeable or allophonic. Finnish front vowels are not umlauts.
Consonant gradation is a lenition process for P, T and K, with the oblique stem "weakened" from the nominative stem, or vice versa. For example, "tarkka" "precise" has the oblique root "tarka-", as in "tarkan" "of the precise". There is also another gradation pattern, which is older, and causes simple elision of T and K. However, it is very common since it is found in the partitive case marker: if V is a single vowel, V+"ta" → Va, e.g. *"vanha+ta" → "vanhaa". Another instance is the imperative, which changes into a glottal stop in the singular but is shown as an overt 'ka' in plural, e.g. "mene" vs. "menkää".
Grammar.
Finnish is a synthetic language that employs extensive regular agglutination of modifiers to verbs, nouns, adjectives and numerals. However, Finnish is not a polysynthetic language, although non-finite dependent clauses may be contracted to infinitives ("lauseenvastike", e.g. "juode·ssa·ni" "when I was drinking", lit. "drink-in-I").
The morphosyntactic alignment is nominative–accusative; but there are two object cases: accusative and partitive. The contrast between the two is telic, where the accusative case denotes actions completed as intended ("Ammuin hirven" "I shot (killed) the elk"), and the partitive case denotes incomplete actions ("Ammuin hirveä" "I shot (at) the elk"). Often this is confused with perfectivity, but the only element of perfectivity that exists in Finnish is that there are some perfective verbs. Transitivity is distinguished by different verbs for transitive and intransitive, e.g. "ratkaista" "to solve something" vs. "ratketa" "to solve by itself". There are several frequentative and momentane verb categories.
Verbs gain personal suffixes for each person; these suffixes are grammatically more important than pronouns, which are often not used at all in standard Finnish. The infinitive is not the uninflected form but has a suffix "-ta" or "-da"; the closest one to an uninflected form is the third person singular indicative. There are four persons, first ("I, we"), second ("you (singular), you (plural)"), third ("s/he, they"). The passive voice (sometimes called impersonal or indefinite) resembles a "fourth person" similar to, e.g., English "people say/do/...". There are four tenses, namely present, past, perfect and pluperfect; the system mirrors the Germanic system. The future tense is not needed, because of context and the telic contrast. For example, "luen kirjan" "I read a book (completely)" indicates a future, when "luen kirjaa" "I read a book (not yet complete)" indicates present.
Nouns may be suffixed with the markers for the aforementioned accusative case and partitive case, the genitive case, eight different locatives, and a few other cases. The case marker must be added not only to the main noun, but also to its modifiers; e.g. "suure+ssa talo+ssa", literally "big-in house-in". Possession is marked with a possessive suffix; separate possessive pronouns are unknown. Pronouns gain suffixes just as nouns do.
Lexicon.
Finnish extensively employs regular agglutination. It has a smaller core vocabulary than, for example, English, and uses derivative suffixes to a greater extent. As an example, take the word "kirja" "a book", from which one can form derivatives "kirjain" "a letter" (of the alphabet), "kirje" "a piece of correspondence, a letter", "kirjasto" "a library", "kirjailija" "an author", "kirjallisuus" "literature", "kirjoittaa" "to write", "kirjoittaja" "a writer", "kirjuri" "a scribe, a clerk", "kirjallinen" "in written form", "kirjata" "to write down, register, record", "kirjasin" "a font", and many others.
Here are some of the more common such suffixes. Which of each pair is used depends on the word being suffixed in accordance with the rules of vowel harmony.
Verbal suffixes are extremely diverse; several frequentatives and momentanes differentiating causative, volitional-unpredictable and anticausative are found, often combined with each other, often denoting indirection. For example, "hypätä" "to jump", "hyppiä" "to be jumping", "hypeksiä" "to be jumping wantonly", "hypäyttää" "to make someone jump once", "hyppyyttää" "to make someone jump repeatedly" (or "to boss someone around"), "hyppyytyttää" "to make someone to cause a third person to jump repeatedly", "hyppyytellä" "to, without aim, make someone jump repeatedly", "hypähtää" "to jump suddenly" (in anticausative meaning), "hypellä" "to jump around repeatedly", "hypiskellä" "to be jumping repeatedly and wantonly", "hyppimättä" "without jumping", "hyppelemättä" "without jumping around". Often the diversity and compactness of this agglutination is illustrated with "istahtaisinkohan" "I wonder if I should sit down for a while" (from "istua", "to sit, to be seated"):
Borrowing.
Over the course of many centuries, the Finnish language has borrowed many words from a wide variety of languages, most from neighboring Indo-European languages. Indeed, some estimates put the core Proto-Uralic vocabulary surviving in Finnish at only around 300 word roots. Owing to the different grammatical, phonological and phonotactic structure of the Finnish language, loanwords from Indo-European have been assimilated.
In general, the first loan words into Uralic languages seem to come from very early Indo-European languages, and later mainly from Iranian, Turkic, Baltic, Germanic, and Slavic languages. Furthermore, a certain group of very basic and neutral words exists in Finnish and other Finnic languages that are absent from other Uralic languages, but without a recognizable etymology from any known language. These words are usually regarded as the last remnant of the Paleo-European language spoken in Fennoscandia before the arrival of the proto-Finnic language. Words included in this group are e.g. "jänis" (hare), "musta" (black), "mäki" (hill), "saari" (island), "suo" (swamp) and "niemi" (cape (geography)).
Also some place names, like Päijänne and Imatra, are probably before the proto-Finnic era.
Often quoted loan examples are "kuningas" "king" and "ruhtinas" "sovereign prince, high ranking nobleman" from Germanic "*kuningaz" and "*druhtinaz"—they display a remarkable tendency towards phonological conservation within the language. Another example is "äiti" "mother", from Gothic "aiþei", which is interesting because borrowing of close-kinship vocabulary is a rare phenomenon. The original Finnish "emo" occurs only in restricted contexts. There are other close-kinship words that are loaned from Baltic and Germanic languages ("morsian" "bride", "armas" "dear", "huora" "whore"). Examples of the ancient Iranian loans are "vasara" "hammer" from Avestan "vadžra", "vajra" and "orja" "slave" from "arya", "airya" "man" (the latter probably via similar circumstances as "slave" from Slav in many European languages).
More recently, Swedish has been a prolific source of borrowings, and also, the Swedish language acted as a proxy for European words, especially those relating to government. Present-day Finland belonged to the kingdom of Sweden from the 12th century and was ceded to Russia in 1809, becoming an autonomous Grand Duchy. Swedish was retained as the official language and language of the upper class even after this. When Finnish was accepted as an official language, it gained only legal "equal status" with Swedish, which persists even today. It is still the case today, though only about 5.5% of Finnish nationals, the Swedish-speaking Finns, have Swedish as their mother tongue. During the period of autonomy, Russian did not gain much ground as a language of the people or the government. Nevertheless, quite a few words were subsequently acquired from Russian (especially in older Helsinki slang) but not to the same extent as with Swedish. In all these cases, borrowing has been partly a result of geographical proximity.
Especially words dealing with administrative or modern culture came to Finnish from Swedish, sometimes reflecting the oldest Swedish form of the word ("lag" – "laki", 'law'; "län" – "lääni", 'province'; "bisp" – "piispa", 'bishop'; "jordpäron" – "peruna", 'potato'), and many more survive as informal synonyms in spoken or dialectal Finnish (e.g. "likka", from Swedish "flicka", 'girl', usually "tyttö" in Finnish).
Typical Russian loanwords are old or very old, thus hard to recognize as such, and concern everyday concepts, e.g. "papu" "bean", "sini" "(n.) blue" and "pappi" "priest". Notably, a few religious words such as "Raamattu" ("Bible") are borrowed from Russian, which indicates language contact preceding the Swedish era. This is mainly believed to be result of trade with Novgorod from the 9th century on and Russian Orthodox missions in the east in the 13th century. For example, the similarity of the words "Hirvas" (a male reindeer in Finnish) and "Irvas" (meaning reindeer in Serbo-Croatian), shows very old contacts between Finno-Ugric and Slavic language families. "Hirvas" is also a name for Eastern Sámi (Skolt Sámi) village which proposes the eastern origin of the word.
Most recently, and with increasing impact, English has been the source of new loanwords in Finnish. Unlike previous "geographical" borrowing, the influence of English is largely "cultural" and reaches Finland by many routes, including international business, music, film and TV (foreign films and programmes, excluding ones intended for a very young audience, are shown subtitled), literature, and, of course, the Web – this is now probably the most important source of all non-face-to-face exposure to English.
The importance of English as the language of global commerce has led many non-English companies, including Finland's Nokia, to adopt English as their official operating language. Recently, it has been observed that English borrowings are also ousting previous borrowings, for example the switch from "treffailla" "to date" (from Swedish, "träffa") to "deittailla" from English "to go for a date". Calques from English are also found, e.g. "kovalevy" (hard disk). Grammatical calques are also found, for example, the replacement of the impersonal ("passiivi") with the English-style generic you, e. g. "sä et voi" "you cannot", instead of "ei voi" "one cannot".
However, this does not mean that Finnish is threatened by English. Borrowing is normal language evolution, and neologisms are coined actively not only by the government, but also by the media. Moreover, Finnish and English have a considerably different grammar, phonology and phonotactics, discouraging direct borrowing. English loan words in Finnish slang include for example "pleikkari" "PlayStation", "hodari" "hot dog", and "hedari" "headache", "headshot" or "headbutt". Often these loanwords are distinctly identified as slang or jargon, rarely being used in a negative mood or in formal language. Since English and Finnish grammar, pronunciation and phonetics differ considerably, most loan words are inevitably sooner or later calqued – translated into native Finnish – retaining the semantic meaning.
Neologisms.
Some modern terms have been synthesised rather than borrowed, for example:
Neologisms are actively generated by the Language Planning Office and the media. They are widely adopted. One would actually give an old-fashioned or rustic impression using forms such as "kompuutteri (computer)" or "kalkulaattori (calculator)" when the neologism is widely adopted.
Orthography.
Finnish is written with the Swedish variant of the Latin alphabet that includes the distinct characters Ä and Ö, and also several characters (b, c, f, q, w, x, z and å) reserved for words of non-Finnish origin. The Finnish orthography follows the phoneme principle: each phoneme (meaningful sound) of the language corresponds to exactly one grapheme (independent letter), and each grapheme represents almost exactly one phoneme. This enables an easy spelling and facilitates reading and writing acquisition. The rule of thumb for Finnish orthography is: "write as you read, read as you write". However, morphemes retain their spelling despite sandhi.
Some orthographical notes:
Although Finnish is almost completely written as it is spoken, there are a few differences:
When the appropriate characters are not available, the graphemes "ä" and "ö" are usually converted to "a" and "o", respectively. This is common in e-mail addresses and other electronic media where there may be no support for characters outside the basic ASCII character set. Writing them as "ae" and "oe", following German usage, is rarer and usually considered incorrect, but formally used in passports and equivalent situations. Both conversion rules have minimal pairs which would no longer be distinguished from each other.
The sounds "š" and "ž" are not a part of Finnish language itself and have been introduced by the Finnish national languages body for more phonologically accurate transcription of loanwords and foreign names. For technical reasons or convenience, the graphemes "sh" and "zh" are often used in quickly or less carefully written texts instead of "š" and "ž". This is a deviation from the phonetic principle, and as such is liable to cause confusion, but the damage is minimal as the transcribed words are foreign in any case. Finnish does not use the sounds "z", "š" or "ž", but for the sake of exactitude, they can be included in spelling. (The recommendation cites the Russian play Hovanshtshina as an example.) Many speakers pronounce all of them "s", or distinguish only between "s" and "š", because Finnish has no voiced sibilants.
The language may be identified by its distinctive lack of the letters "b, c, f, q, w, x, z" and "å."
Important words and phrases.
¹ -te is added to make the sentence formal (T-V distinction). Otherwise, without the added "-te", it is informal. It is also added when talking to more than one person. The transition from second-person singular to second-person plural ("teitittely") is a politeness pattern, advised by many "good manners guides". Elderly people, especially, expect it from strangers, whereas the younger might feel it to be too formal to the point of coldness. However, a learner of the language should not be excessively concerned about it. Omitting it is never offensive, but one should keep in mind that on formal occasions this custom may make a good impression.

Onykia loennbergii

Onykia loennbergii, the Japanese hooked squid, is a species of squid in the family Onychoteuthidae, named for Swedish zoologist Einar Lönnberg. It occurs in the Western Pacific Ocean, at an estimated depth of 230–1200 m. The mantle length is approximately 300 mm. Each tentacular club contains 25 hooks. The arms are about 60% of the size of the mantle length.

Pazhaya Suriyani Pally

Pazhaya Suriyani Pally (loosely translated as Old Syrian Church) is located at Chengannur, 117 km north of the Kerala state capital Thiruvananthapuram on the MC Road. It is one of the ancient Christian Churches in Kerala. 
History.
It is believed that the church was built about 1700 years ago. The structure of the church building certifies that it is very very old. The story is that long ago a hermit priest came to Chengannur and began a worship place at this spot.
Till AD 1580, Nazranis and Knanaya people were worshipping together in this church. Then the Knanaya people who escaped the persecution in Cochin and surrounding area, also joined with those at Chengannur. Later the Knanaya people had built their own church and moved out.
During reformation two groups were formed in the Malankara Church. Those who supported Patriarch of Antioch was known as Bava kakshi and those who supported Malankara Metropolitan, the Metran kakshi. These two factions quarreled in this church and there was a court case. The court found that the clergy from both parties had letters from Mathews Mar Athanasius Metropolitan the then Malankara Metropolitans, and so ordered that the two parties should come to an agreement to share the church between them, on a weekly basis. Thus now the Chengannur Pazhaya Pally is co-owned by the Indian Orthodox Church and the Mar Thoma Church.
Trust Agreement.
The parish is governed according to the Trust Agreement signed by both parties on August 7, 1877.
The signatories of the original Agreement were :
Architecture.
Architectural style is a blend of 18th Century Christian and Hindu temple architecture and something fast disappearing from Kerala landscape . Its gopuravathil, nadapanthal, kalluvilakku and doors adorned with carved figurines including a Hanuman holding a baton. This is indicative of communal and religious harmony exhibited by the localities in yesteryears. 
The Pazhaya Suriyani Pally in Chengannur and the Cheriya Pally (St. Marys Orthodox Church) in Kottayam are unique with the same architectural splendor. 
History.
History has it that Ivanios Yuhanon, a metropolitan from Antioch, Syria, visited Malankara in 1751 and made the western ‘malika’ double storied building) of the Pazhya Suriyani Pally (this ‘malika’ is no more there) his home. Mar Ivanios, credited with the propagation the liturgy of Mar Yacob in Malankara, died in 1794 and was interred in front of the southern ‘thronos’ (altar) of the Church.
There is legend regarding Mar Ivanios’ arrival in Chengannur. When he reached erapuzha kadavu on River Pampa by boat, his followers took him to the Church in a procession. But the Nair chiefs of the land did not allow the procession to pass in front of the Vanchipuzha Chief’s palace and the procession had to take a different route. When the son of Vanjipuzha Chief fell ill, the royal astrologer found that the curse of a saint had fallen on the son. The Chief is said to have tendered an apology to Mar Ivanios whose prayer rid the boy of his illness. In return the Chief bestowed tax-free land and properties to the Church. 
Tablets of History: Over 1200 tombs in the cemetery adjoining the Suriyani Pally, some of them belonging to eminent Christians, stand as mute witness to the bygone days when all Christians were united in Christ but fell apart for reasons purely temporal. George Joseph, who was once President of the Indian National Congress and his brother renowned journalist Pothen Joseph and Padmashri PM Joseph, once principal of the National Physical Education College, Gwalior, are among those buried here.
Suriyani Pally, short of written evidences of its hoary past except perhaps the words carved on the pillars of its nadapanthal, proudly recalls the stories of its tour de resistance against foreign machinations, both from the East and the West. Throughout the centuries the church proclaimed its independence as evidenced by the formation of a Trust ratified by Travancore Royal, Court and latest by the High Court of Kerala 
Two tombs conspicuous by their close proximity to the Church belong to two illustrious sons of the Marthoma Church—Kottooreth Valiachan and Kottarathil Thoma Kaseesa. Valiachan, Rev. M. Joseph Kottooreth, was the first translator of the Syrian liturgy and first Secretary of the Church. He was also the first editor of the Malankara Sabha Tharaka. He also successfully conducted the Suriyani Pally case. Thoma Kaseesa and 11 others founded the Marthoma Suvishesha Sangham, which has been organizing the renowned Maramon Convention for more than a century.
Traditions.
The Church is famous for the Aval Nercha (offering of sweetened rice flakes) held on every Maundy Thursday, for the last four centuries. The current Trustee, V.A.Abraham Vaikkathethu, is one of the chief organisers of the Nercha at present.
The aval nercha custom is said to have an uninterrupted history of not less than 400 years. It was the patronage of the then rural chieftain of Vanjippuzha Palace, attached to the erstwhile kingdom of Venad who ruled Chengannur in the 16th century, which made it a popular event in the region.
The Vanjippuzha chief had given the power of local administration to Thomman Thomman, founder of the Mukkathu family of Syrian Christians, who had migrated to Chengannur in the late 16th century.
Origins of the custom.
According to church trustee V.A. Abraham, the origin of the aval nercha is attributed to an elderly matriarch of the Mukkathu family named Ackamma who used to take a small packet of aval to distribute it to the devotees after the Holy Qurbana on Maundy Thursday.
Ackamma used to give a pinch of rice flakes to all around her, and the members of the Mukkathu family continued the practice even after her death. The aval nercha became an elaborate event in later years, says Babu Zacharia, a former English professor and former president of the Mukkathu Kudumbayogam.
It is believed that a unique eight-headed coconut-scraper was gifted to the church by the royal chief for the annual aval nercha. There are others who believe that the foldable eight-headed coconut scraper is as old as the 1,700-year-old church. This antique piece is a major attraction of the aval nercha.
More than a thousand coconuts, 300 kg of rice flakes, 200 kg of jaggery, and spices go into the preparation of the aval, says Zacharia.
In the olden days, all these items were collected from the members of the Mukkathu family. However, now, rice flakes, jaggery and spices are purchased from the market, while the coconuts are collected from family members.
Collective effort.
As many as 100 family members assemble on the church premises on the eve of Maundy Thursday, immediately after the evening service. The eldest member of the family present breaks a coconut after a short prayer, marking the beginning of the collective preparation of the aval.
The sweetened aval is kept to soak and swell in large bell metal vessels. It is distributed immediately after the morning service.
The faithful here still follow the custom and tradition of accepting the aval nercha in a cloth and not in a container of any kind, says Abraham.

Carl Marstrander

Carl Johan Sverdrup Marstrander (1883-1965) was a Norwegian linguist, known for his work on the Irish language. His works, largely written in Norwegian, on the Celtic and Norse components in Norwegian culture, are considered important for modern Norway.
Life.
He was a student of Sophus Bugge and Alf Torp, and spent time in Ireland from 1907, studying on Great Blasket Island with Tomás Ó Criomhthain, and then teaching at the School of Irish Learning in 1910. From 1913 to 1954 he was Professor in Celtic languages at the University of Oslo. During the German occupation of Norway he was jailed several times. He influenced later linguists, including Alf Sommerfelt and Carl H. J. Borgstrøm.
Scholarly work.
In 1913 he began the actual publication of the long-projected historical "Dictionary of the Irish Language". He is also known for his writings on the history of the Isle of Man, and for securing support and recognition for the Manx historian J. J. Kneen. He made pioneering sound recordings of the Manx language, at a time when few fluent native speakers survived.
He theorised a North Italian or Etruscan origin for the runes. This was, however, partly based on an artefact known now to have been faked.

Jared Wilson (footballer)

Jared Andrew Wilson (born 24 January 1989) is an English footballer who plays for Evesham United. He previously played in the Football League for Birmingham City and Chesterfield, and in non-League football for Worcester City and Cirencester Town. He plays as a full back.
Club career.
Wilson, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, played in the under-18 side that reached the quarter-final of the 2007 FA Youth Cup. Before the 2007–08 season he signed his first one-year professional contract. He made ten appearances for the reserve team and five for the Academy team that season, after which he was given a further one-year contract.
In the build-up to the 2008–09 season, Wilson was part of the first-team squad and, together with fellow youngsters Jordon Mutch and Sone Aluko, went on the club's pre-season tour to Austria. Manager Alex McLeish described him as "an energetic full-back ... one we think could make a career in football". He was given a squad number and included among the substitutes for the Championship match against Crystal Palace in October 2008, but remained unused. A week later, called into the matchday squad at the last minute when Garry O'Connor was injured during the pre-match warm-up, he made his first-team debut as a 12th-minute replacement for the injured Stuart Parnaby in a 1–0 defeat at Queens Park Rangers.
Wilson joined Chesterfield of Football League Two in February 2009 on loan for the remainder of the 2008–09 season. He appeared regularly for the club, and in June 2009 signed a year's extension to his Birmingham contract. In May 2010 the club announced that he would be released when his contract expired at the end of June.
Wilson then spent pre-season on trial with both Cheltenham Town and Bishop's Cleeve but failed to land a deal, which led to his spending a year away from the game. In the summer of 2011, Wilson signed for Worcester City of the Conference North, and featured three times for the club before leaving to sign for Southern League Premier Division club Cirencester Town. In January 2012, Wilson left Cirencester for Evesham United, also playing in the Southern League Premier Division.
Wilson suffered relegation with Evesham at the end of the 2011–12 season but re-signed to remain with the club for the 2012–13 season where they would compete in the Southern League South & West Division.

Think Bike

The Think Bike Campaign was started by biking enthusiasts in South Africa, and is run by bikers, in the interests of road safety and public awareness. Many motorcycle accidents happen because of a lack of awareness of the issues among the general motoring public. The aim of the campaign is to correct that through the use of stickers, leaflets, and information distributed in other ways.
During 2005, a number of bikers were using an online forum to discuss the alarming number of unnecessary motorcycle accidents; avoidable accidents caused by inattentiveness, ignorance, incompetence and failure to exercise due care.
The Think Bike sticker campaign started by Tony Day of Cape Town in the 1980s, and its short life were discussed, and it was decided then and there to revive the campaign and expand on its goals and methods.
Thanks mainly to the dedication, hard work and leadership of the late chairman, Brian Cannoo (Buccaneer), the Think Bike Campaign now has over 1000 paid-up members, over 2000 forum contributors, dozens of sponsors and has to date distributed over 500 000 leaflets, over 200 000 bumper stickers, and reached literally thousands of motorcyclists and motorists with its message.
The campaign, while strongest in the Gauteng province, has representation in Western Cape, KwaZulu Natal and the Free State. It has dozens of trained marshals available for various events such as cycle races and is deeply involved in numerous other projects such as the annual Toy Run.
A number of studies have been done in the past, most notably in the US and UK, that show that an alarming number of motorcycle accidents are directly caused by other vehicles. Being as vulnerable as they are, bikers very often emerge from these avoidable accidents seriously injured, maimed or dead.
It is clear that the accidents we are talking about are the result of ignorance of the issues affecting motorcycles. This campaign is intended to help educate the general public about these issues without pointing fingers or accusing anyone of negligence. Bikers cannot expect motorists to consider their safety if they don't help motorists understand what the roads are like from a bikers' point of view.
The campaign is also aimed at the biking community, to educate about safety issues and encourage the use of protective clothing.
The Hurt Report, published in the US in 1981, showed some alarming trends. More than 900 motorcycle accidents were investigated in the Los Angeles area, and the results showed that:

Allen Buckley

Allen Buckley is an attorney and CPA, who in 2008 ran for one of Georgia's United States Senate seats as a member of the Libertarian Party. He was the party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia in 2006, where he drew 3.6% of the vote, and for Senator in 2004, where he took 2% of the vote. 
Buckley attended Kent State University, earning his bachelor's degree and then graduating in 1985 from the University of Georgia with his JD. In 1989, he earned his LLM in taxation from the University of Florida. Buckley is now an attorney and a CPA in Smyrna, Georgia, with a specialty in tax law and employee benefits.
2008 Senate campaign.
Prior to the election, Buckley captured around 4% to 8% in polling within the margin or difference between the main party candidates.
Buckley has launched two television ads in support of his campaign, calling the Iraq War a "fraud." In August, Chambliss invited Buckley and the Democratic candidates to participate in debates. Buckley polled 8% after appearing in the debates in September, with most of his support coming from Democrats. He has appeared in six debates.
In August, Atlanta-based radio host Neal Boortz said he might vote for Buckley over Chambliss for Chambliss's participation in the "Gang of Ten" energy compromise. Buckley and Boortz argued opposite sides in a Fair Tax debate on CNN, and they had previously debated on Boortz's radio show. 
The "Atlanta Journal-Constitution" said Buckley is: 
On election day Buckley's received 128,002 votes for 3.4% of the vote.
Political positions.
In his 2008 campaign, Buckley suggested that the United States reinstitute immigration policies based on race. According to his campaign web site, "The U.S. has a tremendous illegal immigration problem, and the projected population growth (largely Hispanic) is huge. (The United States should) limit future immigration (and) allow for future immigration in a manner that admits people of all races on a more proportionate basis."
Buckley is a fiscal conservative who has attacked incumbent Chambliss for his support of the Farm Bill, which provides for many subsidies to the farming industry; Chambliss has called them subsidies for the rich during a time of record farm profits. He has attacked the Fair Tax as penalizing the middle class: "The Fair Tax proposal amounts to a vote buy. Presumably, the politicians pressing for it know that the numbers do not work.”
Buckley has said of his energy proposals: "I believe the cleaner a fuel is, the less tax it should bear and the dirtier a fuel is, the more tax it should bear. For example, the current federal excise tax is 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline. If, in the future, one-third of our vehicles run on gasoline, one-third run on batteries and one-third run on hydrogen, and the respective 'well to wheels' CO2 output is 6, 3 and 1, then the 18.4 cent excise tax should be allocated so that gasoline bears 33.1 cents per gallon, battery-powered cars pay 16.6 cents per gallon in gasoline-equivalent terms and hydrogen vehicles pay 5.5 cents per gallon in gasoline-equivalent terms. I support similar tax changes for energy other than vehicle fuels."
To encourage the development of clean fuels, Buckley proposes "rewards (i.e. not grants) be provided for producing systems that convert the U.S. to cleaner-burning energy sources. For example, for vehicles, I recommend a $7 billion reward be granted to the first company or joint venture that produces 10 hydrogen or similarly clean-burning fueling stations and 1,000 vehicles that run on the clean-burning fuel in U.S. metropolitan areas with a population of 3 million or more."
To prevent more federal deficits, Buckley said: "I like tax cuts but only when they're matched with spending cuts, and I've proposed a 25% across-the-board cut in spending apart from Social Security. If we did that right now it would balance the budget, allow the Social Security surplus to be funded, and provide for tax cuts." Buckley has also called for a referendum on whether to increase Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA).

Theodosius of Sinai

Theodosius of Sinai () was a Bulgarian priest, writer and printer. He founded the first Bulgarian printing-house in Thesaloniki. Theodosius of Sinai is considered a Macedonian in the Republic of Macedonia.
Teodosius was born in the late 18th century in the town of Dojran, Ottoman Empire (today in the Republic of Macedonia). His birth name was Teohar (). After he had finished Greek (language) school in Istanbul, Teohar went back to Dojran, where he got married and was later ordained a priest. The death of his wife however drove him into a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. In 1828 Teohar became a monk in Saint Catherine's Monastery and there he adopted the monastic name Teodosiues ("Theodosiy" in Bulgarian).
After returning to the Balkans, Theodosius was appointed a priest in "St. Minas" church in Solun (Thesaloniki) in 1831. While in Solun, he established the firsts printing house in Bulgarian (language) in 1838. Theodosius used the movable type printing press of Daskal Kamche from Vatasha. The moveable types of the press were crafted by a Russian immigrant type-founder. The first books, typed in Teodosius's printing house, were ""Primary study through Slavonic-Bulgarian and Greek Orthodox morning prayers"" ("„Началное учение с молитви утренния славяноболгарский и греческия“") and ""Jewish ceremony and all of the harms, they've done"" - an anti-Semitic lampoon, which was initially translated "to simple and plain Bulgarian language" by Nathanael Ohridski. In 1839 Teodosius typed his own ""A Brief description of twenty monasteries that are situated in the Holly Mount Athos"".
In 1839 Teodosius' printing-house was burned down, but it was soon restored with the finansical support of Kiril Peychinovich. Peychinovich's book "Utesheniе Greshnim" ("Solace of the sinner") was typed in the restored printing-house in 1840. Teodosius wrote аn introduction to the book, where he mentioned that the book was written by Kiril Peychinovich into "...the plainest Bulgarian language, spoken in Lower Moesia, and the region of Skopie and Tetovo...". There Teodosius also praised the Bulgarian language and compared it to a key, which can unlock the heart of the Bulgarian nation for the light of the truth.
In 1841 Teodosius typed a book, called "A book for studying three languages - Slavonic-Bulgarian, Greek and Karamanlian". The book was a Bulgarian-Greek-Turkish dictionary, designed to be of use for merchants.
In 1843 a fire destroyed Teodosius's printing house for a second and final time. Theodosius returned to Dojran, where he began working as a miller in his sons' water-mill. According to Arseniy Kostentsev, the usable remains of Theodosius' printing press were taken to the village of Vataša.
Theodosius died in an accident in March 1843. He was killed by a collapsed roof.
Nine years after Theodosius' death, the brothers Kiryak and Konstantin Darzhilovi opened a new Bulgarian-language printing press in Thessaloniki.

Swapner Feriwala (, ...and they dared to dream) is a 2002 Bengali film. Directed by Subrata Sen, it featured Subrata Dutta, Ferdous Ahmed, Nilanjana Sharma. The film is Nilanjana Sharma's cinematic debut.
Plot.
"Swapner Feriwala" is a soothing fantasy in the pursuit of the last magical charms in our modern, urban lives. It's a symbolic story of youthful and vigorous rebellion against age-old orthodoxy and religious fanaticism and a clarion call to set everyone free of blind prejudices. 
Saritsekhar Roychowdhury, the old descendant of a renowned family, gets obsessed with the attainment of spiritual emancipation and brings a "godman" (Dipankar De) to the house to help him find the true way to freedom. The latter him the confidence of everyone in the family through his Tantra tricks and promises the childless couple a child within a year. 
Som (Subrata Dutta) an iconoclast magician and his friend, a fellow magician named Ferdoup Siddhartha, have devoted their lives to uncover the magic rackets fooling people with petty magic tricks. Som is an enigma, while Siddhartha believes the magic to pervade the beauty of nature, the vastness of the universe, the beautiful movements of togetherness and entire human existence. He wants only to drink the elixir of life and insists Som stop hankering after an elusive goal. The evil godman plots to seize the Roychowdhury house from Sanitsekhar and lay his hands on young, pretty Turni (Nilanjana Sharma), the only granddaughter of Saritsekhar, who lost her parents at an early age. 
Som and Sidhartha befriend Turni and warn her about the upcoming danger in her life. The godman reduces the woman in his aid and entrusts upon her the duty to keep an eye on Turni and to lure her closer to him. Turni escapes their evil plans with the help of the magician duo at first but soon she feels to be at her wit's end when her grandfather donates his house to the godman to build an ashram there. She could not settle elsewhere like her two uncles, being financially dependent on her grandfather. The satanic duo threatens Turni to follow their instructions to stay at the ashram and finally traps her and gets her intoxicated. As the sinister godman pounces upon her, the magician duo comes at her rescue and brings her to consciousness. The godmen fly away while the trio set on a journey.
By then, Turni has fallen for Som while Siddhartha loves her with his whole heart. When she reveals her feeling to Som, he resists her and leaves to follow his destiny. Siddhartha consoles the bereaved Turni and promises to stay with her forever. She recognises her true love in Siddhartha with the help of the magical hourglass, given by her mother and together they start a new journey.

<doc id="19984306" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19984306" title="Senior Scout Adventure">
Senior Scout Adventure

The Senior Scout Cederberg Adventure is a biennial event for Scouts in South Africa, and from overseas, and is organised by the South African Scout Association. The adventure takes the form of a hike of about 10 days, usually in the Cederberg mountains. During this time, participating scouts get to visit a number of activity centres where they can participate in activities ranging from marksmanship and rock climbing to sailing and gold panning.
History.
In 1968, Colin Inglis, the Western Cape Divisional Commissioner at the time, called a meeting to discuss the loss of 15 and 16 year old Scouts, which usually happened before they achieved their 1st Class Badge. He felt that once a Scout had reached the age of 16, troop activities were no longer an adventure for them and as a result they left the movement. He suggested that an adventure activity be held for 16 year old scouts who had obtained their 1st Class Badge, which could be the 'cherry on top' of their scout careers.
The meeting agreed and a small committee was set up to run an event late in 1969. This committee was composed of Colin Inglis, "Fatty" Rutter, Richard Knight, "Impie" Bryant and the Divisional Secretary. The rest of the year was spent organising the location in the Cederberg, testing communications, hiring school busses, finding activity leaders and various other functions. This first adventure was open only to scouts from the Western Cape, but it was so successful that it was requested for subsequent events to be opened to scouts from all over South Africa.
The team decided to rename it 'The National Senior Scout Adventure' and open it to all scouts over 15 and 6 months of age who held the 1st Class Badge. It was decided that if the national event was a success it would be opened up to international scouts. Due to pressure, the minimum age was lowered to 14 for scouts who held their 1st Class Badge and were recommended by their scouter. However, in 2004 the minimum age of 15 was reinstated.
The first national event was held over new years of 1970/1971 and was an even greater success that the experimental event and it was decided that it would be repeated every 2 years. However, this was not always possible and the next one was only held in 1974.
After the 1974 adventure the Cederberg was declared a wilderness area and activity centres were no longer allowed to be in the same location for more than 24 hours due to the new forestry rules. For this reason the 1976 adventure was moved to the Winterhoek. On this adventure a storm made rivers uncrossable and the adventure came to a stand-still for several days until the water subsided. To date, this was the only adventure where a helicopter has been used to rescue scouts, who were trapped in a kloof by rising water. Although unexpected, this added a new dimension to the adventure.
The following three were held in the Witzenberg Valley over the new years of 1978, 1981 and 1983. These adventures went well with the 1983 adventure being the biggest with 600 scouts.
In 1985, permission was obtained from private landowners in the Cederberg to put activity centres on their land and the Department of Forestry gave permission for scouts to hike and camp in the wilderness area. In December 1986, the National Senior Scout Adventure moved back to the Cederberg and has remained there ever since.
Colin Inglis continued to organise adventures in 1988, 1990, 1992 and 1994, until handing over to Richard Goldschmidt for the 1996 and 1998 adventures. Buzz Macey took over as the organiser for 2000 and 2002 when the event was opened up to Guides and Girl Scouts. John Mutti was the Adventure Organiser for 2004 and 2006/7 Centenary of Scouting. Buzz Macey ran the 2008 and 2010 Adventures. The next adventure runs from 10 December 2012 to 22 December 2012 and will be run by Nigel Forshaw.
The adventure is often called 'the Cederberg' by South African Scouts.

Leckwith development

The Leckwith development is in the Leckwith area of southwest Cardiff, Wales. Work started in Autumn 2007 with the construction of a new stadium for Cardiff City F.C. and Cardiff Blues.
The proposal.
The project consists of:
Completion of the development was planned for Spring 2010.
Three way land-swap.
To complete the deal, it involved a simple land-swap arrangement of existing facilities across three sites:
Unfortunately, due to unforeseen issues in construction across the two council owned sites, the football club incurred additional costs. This initially resulted in an agreement to lapse the development of the House of Sport until December 2010. In January 2009, with Cardiff City facing a winding-up order due to an outstanding £2.7M bill to HMRC, the club asked the council for permission to sell the residual 20acres to a developer.
Capital Retail Park.
The Capital Retail Park or Capital Shopping in Leckwith, started building at the end of 2007 and originated from the idea of a new stadium for Cardiff City FC. The retail development has total of 18 retail units including Costco, Asda and M&S Home. It was completed Spring 2009 but some units still remain unoccupied.
The tenants are:
Boots were also on the original list, however they did not officially sign up. It was believed that they would rent the 7A and 7B units; however these units have since been rented by Next, where a large store carrying menswear, ladieswear, childrenswear and homewear is due to open in August 2012.
Matalan were named in an original planning application, but pulled out in March 2005.
Cardiff City Stadium.
The new stadium has 26,828 seats and is home to Cardiff City F.C. club. The stadium also hosted the home matches of the Cardiff Blues rugby union team until the 2011–12 season. It is the second largest stadium in Cardiff and also Wales (the largest being the Millennium Stadium). The stadium cost £29,000,000, Laing O'Rourke was contracted for the whole development.
Cardiff International Sports Stadium.
The new athletics stadium, built to replace the previous Cardiff Athletics Stadium which was demolished to make room for the new rugby and football stadium. Construction started in March 2007. The athletics stadium is the only part of the development to not be built by the main contractor, Laing O'Rourke and instead individual contractor, Cowlin Construction. The stadium will include a gym, meeting rooms, and several offices, which should be completed in the new year. Members of the public are now permitted to come and watch the events that are taking place on the track or field in the now completed stand. The track and field are now open for public use.
Glamorgan Record Office/Glamorgan Archives.
The Glamorgan Record Office moved to a site behind the new football/rugby stadium from the Glamorgan Building in Cathays Park at the end of 2009. The newly renamed Glamorgan Archives offers facilities for visitors to search its 8.5 km of archives relating to the historic county of Glamorgan, as well as conference space for workshops, lectures and school groups, and a modern paper conservation studio.
Leckwith and Droves allotments and city farm.
The allotments, located on Bessemer Road have been caught in the middle of the whole development. Cardiff Council originally planned for the retail park to be built on the current site of the allotments. The older plots, which were then unused were covered in rock, which was then ground into smaller pieces, in early 2008. This still remains there and the rock will be used for the Leckwith development and will also be transported into Cardiff City Centre for the St. David's 2 shopping development.
The plans later showed that the development would be moved slightly further away. The retail park now rests on the previous city farm site. Some of the currently occupied allotments, however still face demolition if the planned Academy of Sport goes ahead.
The unused plots at the entrance to the allotments will soon be the site for a new community centre for disabled children and people with learning disabilities, run by Cardiff-based charity, Vision 21. This development was accepted by Cardiff Council on 20 October 2008, in their most recent development control announcements. This site will include a café, garden centre with a lot at the rear, and a small shop. For local businesses and residents, there will be offices and meeting rooms. The plans also show an energy saving centre and backpackers' overnight accommodation.
Ninian Park.
The stadium was handed over to Redrow Homes by Cardiff City chairman Peter Ridsdale on 10 September 2009. Redrow will build 142 new homes on the site, but it will still be known as Ninian Park. It is proposed at the centre of the new housing development will be a planted square, in the area of Ninian Park’s centre spot. It is also possible that street names of Cardiff City legends are being considered, though this is yet to be decided. The first show home of the £24m development will be opened by late spring 2010. The housing will be a mixture of terraced, detached and semi-detached houses.

The players come from a variety of backgrounds: as well as music teachers and music students, the orchestra includes many pre-professionals, musicians pursuing other careers and, increasingly, players who were trained across the world and who now reside and work in Ireland. What unites the members of the ensemble is their love of classical music and their commitment to the highest possible performance standards. The orchestra has a demanding schedule and prepares between four and five programmes each season based on weekly rehearsals that take place between September and June in St Louis High School, Rathmines, Dublin 6.
The orchestra performs extensively in Dublin and increasingly is bringing music to regional towns across Ireland. Its repertoire stretches across the musical spectrum, ranging from early works to newly commissioned pieces. The list of artists who have performed with the Hibernian Orchestra is impressive and includes many of the Ireland’s most famous virtuosi, including Finghin Collins, Philip Martin, Catherine Leonard, Nicola Sweeney and Iona Petcu-Colon. The orchestra is also committed to providing a platform for the next generation of soloists and has given early solo opportunities to many of Ireland’s most talented young musicians. The orchestra’s efforts to bring classical music to the city of Dublin are supported by Dublin City Council.

Semikron

Semikron is an independent, family-owned and internationally leading manufacturer of power semiconductor components. The company was founded by Dr. Friedrich Josef Martin in Nuremberg in 1951. German-based Semikron employs 3600 people worldwide (1500 in Nuremberg). Semikron comprises a global network of 35 companies with 10 production sites in Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Korea, Slovakia, South Africa and USA. Semikron is a one-stop provider of chips, discrete semiconductors, transistor, diode and thyristor power modules, power assemblies and systems for markets such as industrial drives, wind and solar, hybrid and electric vehicles, the rail industry and power supplies. According to a survey carried out by BTM Consult ApS, the total wind power capacity installed until 2009 was 122 Gigawatt. 57 Gigawatt comprises power semiconductors from Semikron. In the field of diode/thyristor modules Semikron is the market leader with a 30% share of the worldwide market.
The dedication to the hybrid and electric vehicle market is evident in the development and production of power semiconductors for this market but also the majority take-over of Compact Dynamics GmbH in 2010, a development specialist for innovative control systems, the joint venture with drivetek, a provider for application-specific control technology, and the take-over of VePOINT, developing and producing inverters, DC/DC converters and chargers (both in 2011).
Products.
Semikron’s product range consists of 11,600 different power semiconductors from 1 kW to 10 MW, including chips, discrete diodes/thyristors, power modules (IGBT / MOSFET / diode / thyristor/CIB/IPM), driver and protection components and integrated subsystems.
Amongst other developments Semikron invented the world's first isolated power module, the Semipack, of which 56 million are presently in use.
Important innovations of the organization:
Applications.
Today, 57 Gigawatt wind capacity is powered by Semikron technology. 122 Gigawatt (Source: BTM Consult ApS, 03/2008) is the total installed wind capacity since 1993. “Semikron inside“ has become a trademark for new markets such as renewable energy and hybrid vehicles as well as industrial applications such as electric drives, welding machines, lifts, power supplies, pumps, conveyor belts, trains and trams.
State-of-the-art technology.
Spring contacts allows for electrical contacts without soldering. Avoiding solder fatigue, spring contacts are resistant against shock, vibration and corrosion, and provide high temperature cycling in harsh industrial environments. The module is easily assembled to the control PCB only with screws. By pressing the PCB to the module the electrical contacts are established.
When using pressure contact technology, the soldered copper base plate and solder layers are omitted. Therefore modules with SKiiP Technology have fewer solder layers and have a 25% lower thermal resistance compared to leaded modules. This guarantees a longer service lifetime.
Sintering in combination with pressure contact results in an increased service lifetime because critical solder is omitted. The chips are not leaded but sintered by a cold weld to the ceramic. The operating chip temperature of 175°C is only 18% of the disassembly temperature of the sinter layer (solder: 60%). This shows that compared to the solder layer, the sinter layer will not fatigue over time in the application.
Quality & Environment.
Semikron has an integrated management system and is certified according to DIN EN ISO 9001:2000, VDA 6.1, OHRIS Work Security Management. The environmental management system is according to DIN EN 14001 and EMAS. All Semikron products do not contain Mercury, Cadmium, Hexavalent Chromium, PBB or PBDE. All products are lead-free according to the RoHS directives.
eCommerce.
Via an associated company of the Semikron Group it is possible to order online at the power semiconductor portal SindoPower.
Social engagement.
In memoriam to the wife of the company founder, a registered association called “Martin Care e. V” was started in the eighties. The association provides for orphans in Brazil. Additionally projects in India, South Africa and other parts of the world are supported.
In a children daycare centre at the Nuremberg headquarter Semikron offers 74 places for children of employees from SEMIKRON and other companies operating in the proximity, from the age of 1 year to school age. The centre is open from Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. and offers flexible childcare hours. It is also opened during school holidays and even offers vacation care for brothers and sisters. It was inaugurated by the German Minister for Family Affairs Dr. Ursula von der Leyen at the opening ceremony of SEMIKRON’s daycare centre on 27 June 2007.

He returned to Algeria in 1836 as aide-de-camp to general Trézel, with whom he participated in the 1836 Constantine expedition. For his conduct on that campaign and for saving general Trézel after the latter was wounded by a musket-ball, he was decorated with the Légion d’honneur.
Punishing the popular revolt of 15 September 1841 at Clermont-Ferrand, many people demanded his promotion but this was refused by Louis-Philippe of France due to his belonging to an Ultra-royalist family. A candidate for the deputation of 1848, he was not elected, though he rose to colonel in 1851. In the Italian campaign he was chef d’état-major of the Motte-Rouge division of the 2nd Army Corps under the orders of Mac-Mahon. He was wounded in the fighting at Turbigo, then at the battle of Magenta.
Made a general on 28 February 1868, he received the command of the 3rd division of 2nd Corps in 1870. On 2 August 1870 he and Bataille were charged with a reconnaissance which led to the battle of Sarrebruck. He fought at the battle of Spicheren on 6 August then retreated to Metz, which surrendered on 28 October, leaving Laveaucoupet a prisoner. When he returned to France he was recalled by the National Assembly of 1871. He fought in the last battles and in the raising of the Montmartre butte on 28 May 1871 during the Commune of Paris in 1871. He was called as a witness at the trial of Bazaine.

Vlorë Wind Farm

The Vlorë Wind Farm is a proposed wind farm in Albania. It will have 250 individual wind turbines with a nominal output of around 2 MW each, which will deliver up to 500 MW of power. 
The project, which has already been approved by the Albanian government, will have a total generating capacity of 500 megawatts. Europe's biggest onshore wind farm, currently under construction in Scotland, will have a generating capacity of 322 MW. 
It will also includes the construction of a transmission line between the Italian city of Brindisi and the Albanian port of Vlora. The 400 kV power cable, stretching 145 km across the Otranto channel under the Adriatic Sea at a depth of over 900 metres, will allow for electricity to be transmitted in either direction between the two countries. 
The wind farm is expected to be located on the Karaburun peninsula close to the city of Vlora, a former military installation, off limits to the public, during Albania’s communist regime.

Dying Breed

Dying Breed is a 2008 Australian horror film that was directed by Jody Dwyer and stars Leigh Whannell and Nathan Phillips.
Plot.
The film opens with the back story of Van Dieman's Land, a penal colony used by the British Empire. During the 1820s, Alexander Pearce, a prisoner known as "the Pieman", has escaped into the wilderness and he is being hunted by policemen with dogs. He is faced by a policeman who attempts to shoot Pearce, but his gun does not fire. Pearce then bites the policeman's neck, taking a large chunk from his throat, killing him, allowing Pearce to escape.
In present day, Nina, a zoologist, plans a trip with her boyfriend Matt to Tasmania to find the supposedly extinct Tasmanian tiger. Her endeavor is encouraged by a paw print that was discovered by her older sister in a remote area of the island before her body was mysteriously found in the Pieman River several years before. Matt's friend, Jack, and his girlfriend, Rebecca, help pay for the trip and accompany the fellow couple. When they arrive, Matt sees a small girl on the boat playing a game with yellow-tinted teeth. When Matt asks what she is doing, she recites a rhyme, but Matt gets too close and then bites his hand, causing it to bleed.
The group reaches their small town destination, and Jack decides to puncture the tire of one of the vehicles because it "makes him feel better". They enter the local pub and commingle with the odd natives of the town. Jack later discovers that his new vehicle has been scratched in retaliation for puncturing the tire, causing him to become angry. Later in the evening, the couples retreat to their rooms, and Jack and Rebecca amorusly copulate until they realize that somebody is watching them. A nude Jack runs after the voyeur, restrains him against a tree, and beats him.
The next day, the group goes out on a boat in the river along the forest. They decide to camp in a cave out in the woods, and later that evening Matt and Nina discover one of the Tasmanian tigers creeping through the bush. Nina rushes to get her camera to take a picture of the tiger, but it has run into the woods. The group goes into the dark after the tiger using their cell phones as light because capturing proof of its existence is critical to Nina's research. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, Rebecca is captured and eaten by a cannibal. When the other three re-group, they realize that Rebecca is missing and that Nina has blood on her pant legs.
Confused, the group searches for Rebecca and encounter the young girl from the boat near the cave. Nina drops a picture of her sister, which the young girl picks up, and announces, "It's Mama!" The girl's apparent father arrives in search of the girl. He agrees to help them find Rebecca, and leads them to an old mine tunnel and warns them of the booby traps, but he will not be going any further with them. The group goes in search of Rebecca, but the man who helped them, starts after them but is killed shortly after pausing and saying to an unseen figure, "We don't have to do this."
Jack finds Rebecca's phone and jacket covered in blood when Nina and Matt catch up to him. Jack mistakenly shoots one of the native villagers with a crossbow through the cheek, causing the villager to have his face pinned against a tree. Matt pulls the man's head off the arrow, and they start walking further. Soon they encounter a shack, and Matt and Jack begin to investigate. They find the dismembered body of Rebecca hanging in the trees by the shack. Jack starts to go crazy, but his leg gets caught in a bear trap, which causes him to fall to the ground, forcing his head into another bear trap. Scared, Nina flees the area and Matt attempts to find her.
The cannibals head after Nina, but Nina injures her leg while trying to escape. She hobbles onto a bridge where they cannibals reveal that her sister was fertile and gave birth to a child, but she jumped into the river while trying to escape capture. They imply that Nina will also be used for breeding like her sister was. Nina decides to jump from a bridge into the river while Matt screams in horror. When Matt arrives at the bridge, a village woman is standing there, and Matt believes that she killed Nina. The woman then pulls a knife and cuts her own throat.
Later, Matt is back at the town and the police have come to investigate the incident. Because Matt was separated from Nina, he is unaware of the face-punctured man's role in the incident. He is given a mug with a drink in it, and when he gets into his car to drive away, he finds that the drink was drugged and he cannot move.
He is later seen paralyzed in a chair while one of the cannibals explains that their settlement, much like the tiger, must stay hidden to survive. The cannibal then opens a door exposing a live Nina tied to a table, about to be raped for breeding purposes. While Matt watches, the young girl who was actually Nina's niece approaches him, removes a set of dentures, thus exposing a set of sharp deformed teeth. She then lunges at Matt, saying "I'm hungry!"

Crawling King Snake

"Crawling King Snake" (alternatively "Crawlin' King Snake" or "Crawling/Crawlin' Kingsnake") is a blues song that has been recorded by numerous blues and other artists. It is believed to have originated as a Delta blues in the 1920s and be related to earlier songs, such as "Black Snake Blues" by Victoria Spivey (1926 OKeh 8338) and "Black Snake Moan" by Blind Lemon Jefferson (1926 OKeh 8455).
As "Crawling King Snake", it was first recorded by Big Joe Williams on March 27, 1941. The song is a country-style blues, with Williams on vocal and nine-string guitar and William Mitchell providing imitation bass accompaniment. On June 3, 1941, Delta bluesman Tony Hollins recorded "a markedly different version" (OKeh 06350), which served as the basis for many subsequent versions.
John Lee Hooker versions.
John Lee Hooker began performing "Crawling King Snake" early in his career and included it in his sets after arriving in Detroit, Michigan in the early 1940s. In an interview, Hooker explained that he adapted Tony Hollins song: "I got that 'Crawling King Snake' from him ". Hooker first recorded the song in Detroit on February 18, 1949 for producer Bernard Besman. When it was released by Los Angeles-based Modern Records, "Crawling King Snake" became one of Hooker's most successful singles, reaching number six on the Billboard R&B chart in 1949. 
Hooker recorded several subsequent versions of the song, including one with Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards for Hooker's 1991 album "Mr. Lucky". "Crawling King Snake" "remained one of his signature songs and became a concert staple for dozens of blues-rock bands".
Other recordings.
Various musicians have recorded their interpretations of "Crawling King Snake", including Howlin' Wolf (1966), Big Walter Horton (1970), and Muddy Waters (1971). American rock band The Doors, who had performed the song since the earliest days of the band, recorded it for their 1971 album "L.A. Woman". Eric Burdon recorded it as a two minute-track for his 1982 album "Comeback"; his complete 11 minute version is included on a later compilation album. Other versions include those by George Thorogood (1985 "Maverick"), Junior Kimbrough (1994 "Sad Days, Lonely Nights"), Buddy Guy (2003 "Blues Singer"), Etta James (2004 "Blues to the Bone"), and Peter Green Splinter Group (2001 "Blues Don't Change", released 2012).

The Generating Company

The Generating Company is an international touring circus company producing large scale commercially successful shows and events around the world. Most recent shows include 'Voyage de la Vie' at Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore and 'Aqua' the world's largest water show located in Shenzhen southern China. The company produces events and runs training programmes for established artists and young people.The company is based in London, England and Le Buisson-de-Cadouin, France. The company premiered to critical success at the Millennium Dome until moving operations to The Circus Space in Hoxton in 2001. The company now works internationally.
History.
Formation.
The Generating Company founder, Paul Cockie, collaborated with Peter Gabriel and Mark Fisher, in 1998 to create a show for the Millennium Experience, a exhibition hosted at the Millennium Dome to welcome the third millennium. The crew turned to Circus Space, which offers the only national diploma in circus skills. With little more than a year until opening night, Circus Space formed an accredited program and trained 87 aerial performers for the Dome show.
The Dome show premiered on New Year's Eve, 1999. While the Dome itself was mired in controversy and financial woes, the show opened to critical success. With only a year long contract at the Dome, many of the show's performers considered a return to Circus Space to continue their careers. When the show closed at the end of 2000, about 20 of the performers returned to Circus Space to form The Generation Company, a small traveling company that retained many of the characteristics of the original Dome performance.
Financing and schools.
Following their success at the Dome and Circus Space, The Generating Company received a £70,000 grant from the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts and grants from the Arts Council England to begin a touring company. After a local show, Storm, performed at Circus Space in Hoxton, The Generating Company began pursuing a "fusion of professional training with an extended performance contract linked to future touring opportunities." It opened its first school in 2002, offering summer courses devised for children interested in circus skills. It also hosted programs at Trinity Buoy Wharf through 2009.
In 2008, The Generating Company decided to move the majority of its professional schooling and develop a creative centre at Le Buisson-de-Cadouin, France. Paul Cockle explained that setting up the company in France offered the chance to develop a residential centre where artists can live and work together. The new centre has been in the company's plans since its very beginnings in the Dome. With work stretching across the globe the company needs space to develop and bring international artists together to create work. The Generating Company still has administration offices in London but its core operation is based in France.
"Dragons' Den".
The Generating Company successfully appeared on the "Dragons' Den" in December 2005. Represented by Paul Cockle, Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis decided to invest in the company. Together they invested £160,000 into the company and own a 40% stake.

The Fame

The Fame is the debut studio album by American recording artist Lady Gaga. It was released on August 19, 2008 through Interscope Records. After joining Kon Live Distribution and Cherrytree Records in 2008, Gaga began working on the album with different producers, primarily RedOne, Martin Kierszenbaum and Rob Fusari. Musically, "The Fame" is a synthpop and dance-pop album that has influences of pop music from the 1980s. Lyrically, the album visualizes Gaga's love of fame in general while also dealing with subjects such as love, sex, money, drugs and sexual identity. Promotion was primarily through The Fame Ball Tour and multiple television appearances. "The Fame" was included as a bonus disc on the deluxe edition of the extended play, "The Fame Monster" (2009).
The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended the album's lyrical content and Gaga's musicianship and vocal ability, which have been compared to fellow pop singers such as Gwen Stefani. The album was a commercial success, topping the charts in different countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Poland and Switzerland. In the United States, it peaked at number two on the "Billboard" 200, while topping the Dance/Electronic Albums chart for 106 non-consecutive weeks.
The first two singles from "The Fame", "Just Dance" and "Poker Face", gained international success, topping the charts in several countries worldwide, including the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. "LoveGame" and "Paparazzi", were commercial successes as well, charting within the top ten of more than ten countries worldwide. "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" was released in the form of a promotional single. "The Fame" has won multiple awards since its release. It was nominated for a total of six Grammy Awards at the 52nd Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It won the Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album and the Best Dance Recording for the single "Poker Face". It also won Best International Album at the 2010 BRIT Awards. In 2013, "Rolling Stone" named "The Fame" as one of the "100 Greatest Debut Albums of All-Time".
Background and development.
While establishing herself as an artist and working her way up through the New York underground club scene, Gaga released her debut studio album, "The Fame". Speaking about the title and concept of the album, Gaga explained: ""The Fame" is about how anyone can feel famous. [...] Pop culture is art. It doesn't make you cool to hate pop culture, so I embraced it and you hear it all over "The Fame". But, it's a sharable fame. I want to invite you all to the party. I want people to feel a part of this lifestyle." Gaga stated in an interview with MTV UK that she had been working on the album for two and a half years and completed half of it during the first week of January 2008. As well as writing the lyrics, Gaga worked on the melodies and synth work of the album, with record producer RedOne. According to Gaga, the first track "Just Dance" is a joyous, heart-themed song, which appeal to people going through tough times in their life. "LoveGame", the second track, was inspired by Gaga's sexual crush on a stranger in a night club to whom she said, "I wanna ride on your disco stick". It was written in four minutes based on the disco stick hook. "Paparazzi" has been interpreted with different meanings. However Gaga explained in an interview with About.com, that the song was inspired by her struggles and hunger for fame and love. Essentially a love song, "Paparazzi" dealt with enticing the media and asked the question, whether one can have both fame and love.
"Poker Face" was inspired by Gaga's boyfriends who enjoyed gambling, and also dealt with her personal experience of bisexuality; her fantasies about women while having sex with men, thus representing her 'poker face'." "Boys, Boys, Boys" was inspired by the similarly titled Mötley Crüe song "Girls, Girls, Girls". Gaga explained that she wanted a female version of the song that rockers would like too. "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" summed up her time of self-discovery, living in the Lower East Side and dabbling in drugs and the party scene. "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" was about breaking up with a boyfriend and finding someone new. "Brown Eyes" was inspired by the British rock band Queen and, according to Gaga, is the most vulnerable song on the album.
Gaga further clarified the ideas behind "The Fame", and her inspirations and visions for the album. She believed that the most important thing missing from contemporary pop music was the combination of the visual imagery of the artist with the music. Gaga incorporated theatrics in her live performances of the songs from the album. Hence she hoped that people would take notice of the performance art, which she was trying to bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the lifestyle in front of it.
"I just feel like this record is really different- you[']ve got club bangers to more 70s glam to more singer-songwriter records to rock music. [...] "The Fame" is not about who you are—it's about how everybody wants to know who you are! Buy it and listen to it before you go out or in the car. [...] I think you've really got to allow artists' creativity to marinate. It took me a while but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record[,] it's a whole pop art movement[.] It's not just about one song."
Composition.
Musically, the album drew influences from late 1970s glam rock musicians such as David Bowie and Queen. Gaga incorporated their glam-rock sound while devising catchy pop melodies and hooks to create what she has dubbed, "theatrical pop". Songs like "Poker Face", "Just Dance" and "LoveGame" are uptempo dance songs, with "Poker Face" carrying a dark sound with clear vocals on the chorus and a pop hook. "Just Dance" is synth-based while "LoveGame" has a more dance-oriented beat, and "Money Honey" has a moderate techno groove. All of them combined synths of clipped marching beats, sawing electronics and contained mild R&B-infused beats. "Paparazzi" carried a sultry beat while "Summerboy" had influences of the music of Blondie. "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" is credited as a ballad compared to the rest of the dance-fueled tracks from "The Fame". The song has a 1980s synthpop feeling in it, while incorporating the "Eh, Eh" hook from Rihanna's single "Umbrella" (2007).
Lyrically, the songs on "The Fame" talk about being famous and achieving popularity; "Poker Face" is about sexual innuendo and teasing. Gaga explained in an interview with the "Daily Star" that the lyrics carry a bit of an undertone of confusion about love and sex. According to the BBC, the "Mum-mum-mum-mah" hook used in the song is copied from Boney M's 1977 hit "Ma Baker". "Just Dance" talks about being intoxicated in a party, with lyrics like "What's going on on the floor? / I love this record, baby but I can't see straight anymore". "LoveGame" portrays a message about love, fame and sexuality which is akin to the central theme of album. "Paparazzi" portrays a stalker who is following somebody being his or her biggest fan. The lyrics also portray the desire of capturing the attention of the camera as well as achieving fame. Gaga explained that,
"This idea of "The Fame" runs through and through. Basically, if you have nothing—no money, no fame—you can still feel beautiful and dirty rich. It's about making choices, and having references—things you pull from your life that you believe in. It's about self-discovery and being creative. The record is slightly focused, but it's also eclectic.[...] The music is intended to inspire people to feel a certain way about themselves, so they'll be able to encompass, in their own lives, a sense of inner fame that they can project to the world, and the carefree nature of the album is a reflection of that aura. I like to funnel interesting ideas to the rest of the world through a pop lens."
Critical reception.
"The Fame" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, based on 13 reviews. Matthew Chisling from Allmusic called the album "a well-crafted sampling of feisty anti-pop in high quality", and wrote that it "fails to come up short on funky sounds to amuse fans of this dance genre." Nicole Powers of "URB" complimented its "irony-laden lyrics, delivered in a style that owes a little something to Gwen Stefani," as well as the album's "deluxe ditties". Mikael Wood of "Entertainment Weekly" called it "remarkably (and exhaustingly) pure in its vision of a world in which nothing trumps being beautiful, dirty, and rich. In this economy, though, her high-times escapism has its charms". Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" found it "packing an immensely addictive melody or an inescapable hook, virtually everything sounds like another hit single", and predicted that it "certainly sounds like it could be big." Daniel Brockman from "The Phoenix" wrote that "Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy songwriting and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon." Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised Gaga's "blend of sassy attitude, metallic beats and sharp, incisive songwriting", elements which he felt are integral to "creating pop music".
Although he panned "Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)", "Paper Gangsta", and "Brown Eyes", Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called "The Fame" "a solid dance album" and wrote that "much of the album’s success can be attributed to rising club producer RedOne." Joey Guerra from the "Houston Chronicle" felt that although the songs present in the album are not innovative, Gaga deserved credit for bringing real dance music to the mass. Genevieve Koski of "The A.V. Club" felt that the "whole point" of the album is "glitter-laced, dance-inciting energy that bodes well for extended club play". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani viewed that Gaga's lyrics veer between "cheap" and "nonsensical drivel", while her singing is "uneven at best". He added that the highlights such as "Poker Face", "Starstruck", "Paper Gangsta", and "Summerboy" rely "almost solely on their snappy production and sing-along hooks." Freedom du Lac from "The Washington Post" criticized the album for lacking originality. MSN Music's Robert Christgau gave the album an "honorable mention" and quippedly referred to it as "shallowness at its most principled." "The Fame" garnered five Grammy nominations at the 52nd Grammy Awards on December 2, 2009. The album itself was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Electronic/Dance Album.

"LoveGame" was released as the third single in the United States, Canada and some European nations. It was the fourth single in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Promotion.
To promote the album, Gaga did several performances worldwide. Her first televised appearance was on Logo's NewNowNext Awards on June 7, 2008. She also performed on "Michalsky StyleNite at Berlin Fashion Week", "So You Think You Can Dance", "Jimmy Kimmel Live!", "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno", as well as in Vietnam for the 57th Miss Universe beauty pageant during the swimsuit competition. On January 31, 2009, she performed on television in Ireland on RTÉ One's show "Tubridy Tonight".

Gaga also performed "Poker Face" on "American Idol" on April 1, 2009. To celebrate the launch of the show "Dirty Sexy Money", ABC created a music video of Gaga's song "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich", directed by Melina Matsoukas. It was initially announced as Gaga's second single, but "Poker Face" was chosen instead. There were two videos released for the song – the first was composed of clips from "Dirty Sexy Money", and the second was the actual music video. The song charted on the UK Singles Chart due to digital downloads and peaked at number eighty-three.
The album received further promotion from her first headlining concert tour The Fame Ball Tour, which started on March 12, 2009 in San Diego, California. It was Gaga's first concert tour with North American shows in March, followed by dates in Oceania and a solo trek through Europe. Dates in Asia soon followed, as well as two performances at England's V Festival and two shows in North America that had been postponed from April. Gaga described the tour as a traveling museum show incorporating artist Andy Warhol's pop-performance art concept. Tickets were distributed for charity also. Alternate versions of the show with minimal variations were planned by Gaga to accommodate different venues. The show consisted of four segments, with each segment being followed by a video interlude to the next segment, and it ended with an encore. The set list consisted of songs from "The Fame" only. Gaga appeared on the stage in new costumes including an innovative dress made entirely of bubbles and premiered an unreleased song called "Future Love". An alternate set list with minor changes was performed for European dates. The show received positive critical appreciation with critics complimenting her vocal clarity and fashion sense as well as her ability to pull off theatrics like a professional artist. Gaga's second headlining tour, The Monster Ball Tour was also heavily consistent with songs from "The Fame" album, besides tracks from the follow-up EP, "The Fame Monster". Her 3rd concert tour, "The Born This Way Ball" had 4 songs off The Fame as well.
"The Fame Monster".
Originally intended to be a re-release of "The Fame" with eight additional tracks, Gaga and her record label announced that "The Fame Monster" would be a standalone album containing the eight new songs. The deluxe edition of the album contains "The Fame" in its entirety along with "The Fame Monster". The album deals with the darker side of fame, as experienced by Gaga over the course of 2008–09 while travelling around the world, and are expressed through a monster metaphor. Gaga compared the feel of her debut album and "The Fame Monster" with the Yin and yang concept. Cover artwork was done by Hedi Slimane and has a gothic look which Gaga had to convince her record company to allow her to shoot. The composition takes its inspiration from Gothic music and fashion shows. Contemporary critics gave a positive review of the album, with the majority of them complimenting the songs "Bad Romance", "Telephone", and "Dance in the Dark". In some countries the album charted together with "The Fame" while in others like the United States, Canada and Japan, it charted as a separate album. It has reached top ten in most of the major markets. She announced The Monster Ball Tour supporting the album, which started on November 27, 2009, and continued through until Spring 2011.

Emancipation (House)

"Emancipation" is the eighth episode of the fifth season of "House" and the ninety-fourth episode overall. It aired on November 18, 2008.
Plot.
Sixteen year old Sophia, an emancipated minor working at a factory, suddenly clutches her chest and coughs up blood. Meanwhile, House comes into Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital and House claims he did not ask Cuddy out; although Wilson does not comment, House suspects something is up. The team takes on the case and Foreman suggests Sophia's collapse is due to pregnancy, but Kutner does not believe it, nor the notion that she is taking drugs, as Thirteen suggests. House orders an echo, but Foreman asks to be let go temporarily to do clinical trials. House refuses, claiming he might need him for the current case. Taub and Thirteen go to Sophia's apartment and discover a bong, suggesting drug use, but Kutner believes Sophia needs steroids for vasculitis.
Unfortunately, House tells Foreman to put her on beta-blockers, yet Foreman informs the rest of the team to take care of it and leaves. While Kutner administers the beta-blockers, Sophia claims the bong belonged to her ex-boyfriend and admits the doctors have no reason to trust her, insisting she has not used drugs. Believing her, Kutner aptly switches the medication to steroids. In the meantime, Foreman is doing clinic duty, but Cuddy wonders if he is trying to prove something to House. She hands him a case involving 4-year old Jonah, who is suffering from bloody vomit and diarrhea. His older brother Evan is surprisingly knowledgeable about medical procedure and thoughtful of him. When Sophia develops a psychotic breakdown, Kutner admits to giving her steroids and House blames Foreman for leaving it up to Kutner.
Foreman suggests prinzmetal angina, causing an artery in the brain to spasm, and House reluctantly agrees, but orders Foreman to trigger a spasm. Again, Foreman tells the team to set it up and page him when they are ready to run the procedure, due to Jonah's ongoing case. When attempting to look in his digestive system with a camera, Jonah starts giggling uncontrollably and Foreman is stumped. Talking to Cameron and Chase for a differential, Chase notes the case is not interesting, but since House is not the primary, they will look into it. However, he warns Foreman it will not be enough to prove anything.
During an MRI scan, Kutner notices activity in the limbic system of her brain, indicating she was lying when she claims her parents are dead. Confronting her, Sophia reveals she is emancipated because her father raped her and her mother did not do anything about it. Back at the differential, Kutner suggests she might by lying about the rape and House notes it could due to emotional stress, explaining her symptoms, thus orders a round of anti-anxiety drugs. Alone with Wilson, he explains his reason about not asking Cuddy out, but Wilson insists on not giving opinions or insights, making House less than thrilled. Meanwhile, Cameron and Chase are just as stumped on Jonah's case, with Cameron noting that Foreman needs to focus on one case or the other. Just as Thirteen administers the anti-anxiety medication for Sophia, Foreman realizes the drugs are not helping, as her urine has turned dark-colored.
Continuing the differential, House wonders about Sophia's homemade furniture and Thirteen reports holes in the wood, indicating they were pressure treated, thus saying it would have released arsenic into the air. When Foreman gets paged by Cameron and Chase, who still have not found anything regarding Jonah, Chase states they need more help than they can provide, but Foreman is still reluctant to ask House.
Meanwhile, Thirteen removes the arsenic from Sophia's body with chelation, but the patient suffers a seizure after the treatment is over. House concludes the arsenic was fighting what is killing Sophia and tells them to put it back in. The team considers leukemia, thus Sophia requires a bone marrow donor. A biopsy confirms acute promyelocytic leukemia and although the patient is adamant in not contacting her parents for a bone marrow donation, Thirteen leaves to find Sophia's parents herself, only to discover the patient had stolen the identity of the "real" Sophia. The patient admits to identity fraud, but still refuses to call her family, noting that when she gets sick enough, the team will give her the donation without parental consent.
Foreman, Cameron and Chase still mull over Jonah's case until Chase suggests if the patient's mother or brother has anything to do with his symptoms. An idea hits Foreman: the mother states she only gives one tablet of vitamins to her sons each day, but Evan must have urged Jonah to take more than he requires. Foreman diagnoses Jonah with an iron overdose and because Evan did it out of good intentions for his brother, Foreman assures him his brother will forgive him.
The next morning, the team has found a partial donor for "Sophia", but it is nearly impossible for her to receive a second donation if the first fails. House tells them to treat the patient no matter what, but deduces her rationalization over not calling her parents overrides her emotional desire to not contact them. He confronts her, claiming "she" must have done something to them, rather than the other way around. The patient finally admits to killing her infant brother. She tells House he drowned taking a bath while she was supposed to be watching him. House states if she dies by refusing treatment, her parents will hate her for killing their remaining child. "Sophia" relents and asks her parents to help her. They come to the hospital and reunite with their daughter.
With both cases solved, Foreman confidently tells House he will do clinical trials, having proven he can handle two patients at the same time. House gives his approval, leaving Foreman bewildered, but House explains that all Foreman had to do was tell him, rather than ask. As House leaves, Wilson notes his friend made a noble gesture, but that what House wanted was to prove to Foreman that he (Foreman) can handle the situation. House denies the accusation. Wilson wonders if House is still interested in talking about Cuddy, and House insists he is not.
Music.
This episode features "Through the Dark" by Scottish singer-songwriter Alexi Murdoch.

The Death of Actaeon

The Death of Actaeon is a late work by Italian Renaissance master Titian, painted in 1559 to 1575 as an oil on canvas and now housed in the National Gallery of London, United Kingdom. It is probably one of the two paintings the artist states he has started and hopes to finish (one of which he calls "Actaeon mauled by hounds") in a letter to their commissioner Philip II of Spain during June 1559. However, most of Titian's work on this painting possibly dates to the mid-1560s, and as Titian seems never to have resolved it to his satisfaction, the painting remained in his studio until his death in 1576.
It is a sequel of Titian's work "Diana and Actaeon" showing the story's tragic conclusion, which approximately follows the Roman poet Ovid's account in the "Metamorphoses": after Actaeon surprised the goddess Diana bathing naked in the woods, she transformed him into a stag and he was attacked and killed by his own hounds. Both paintings belong to a group of large-scale mythological paintings inspired by the "Metamorphoses" and referred to by Titian himself as ‘poesie’, the visual equivalent of poetry, which he began producing for Philip II of Spain in 1551 and which also include "Danaë" and "Venus and Adonis" (Museo del Prado, Madrid), "Perseus and Andromeda" (Wallace Collection, London), "The Rape of Europa" (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston) and "Diana and Callisto" (National Gallery).
The public campaign in 1971 to buy it for the United Kingdom was one of the great successes of Martin Davies's directorship of the National Gallery and it was eventually purchased in 1972 with a special grant and Art Fund and Pilgrim Trust contributions, as well as via funds raised by a public appeal. As catalogue number NG6420, it now usually hangs in the Central Hall.

Emma Carelli

Emma Carelli (12 May 1877, Naples – 17 August 1928, near Rome) was an Italian operatic soprano who was particularly associated with the dramatic soprano roles of the verisimo repertoire and the works of Richard Wagner.
After a singing career which lasted almost two decades, she managed the Teatro Costanzi in Rome for almost fifteen years. After studying with her father, Beniamino Carelli, at the Conservatorio San Pietro a Majella, she made her professional debut in 1895 in the title role of Mercadante's "La vestale" during the centenary celebrations at Altamura and went on to appear in the opera houses of many Italian cities. In 1898 she married the left-wing politician, self-made millionaire, and later impresario, Walter Mocchi.
She sang in several world premieres including: Pietro Floridia's "La Colonia libera" (1899); Meryem in Cesare Galeotti's "Anton" (1900) and Rosaura in Mascagni's "Le maschere" at La Scala in 1901. For several years she also sang in South America, primarily Argentina, as part of a touring troupe organized by her husband. In 1903, she sang the title role in Edoardo Mascheroni's opera "Lorenza" for its South American premiere in Buenos Aires. She became particularly associated with the title role in Leoncavallo's "Zazà" and sang in several operas by Richard Wagner, including the roles of Kundry in "Parsifal" and Elisabeth in "Tannhäuser". She also sang the title role in Puccini's "Tosca", the title role in Giordano's "Fedora", Santuzza in Mascagni's "Cavalleria rusticana", and Margherita in Boito's "Mefistofele" among other roles.
In 1908, Carelli's husband purchased the Teatro Costanzi. His company, Società Teatrale Internazionale, produced the world premiere of Leoncavallo's "Maia" during its second season. Carelli took over the management from her husband in 1912 with a new company (Impresa Teatro Costanzi), while he concentrated on running the South American the touring troupe and the Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro and the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. During her 14 year management of the theatre, several operas received their first Rome performances including Richard Strauss's "Elektra" (in which she sang the title role), "La fanciulla del West", "Turandot" and "Il trittico" by Giacomo Puccini; "Parsifal" by Richard Wagner; "Francesca da Rimini" by Riccardo Zandonai; "Boris Godunov" by Modest Mussorgsky; "Samson et Dalila" by Camille Saint-Saëns. Apart from Elektra, her only other performance as a singer during that time was in the title role of Mascagni's "Iris". In 1926, Carelli and Walter Mocchi sold the Costanzi to the Rome City Council and withdrew from most of their other business interests in South America. Carelli died two years later in a car accident. A few years after her death, Mocchi married Bidu Sayão, whose career Carelli had fostered.

SY control cable

SY Control Cable is a flexible instrumentation cable designed for measuring, control or regulation in the field of process automation. It is a highly flexible multicore cable, with (class 5) copper conductors and a galvanised steel wire braid (GSWB) for mechanical protection. The cable is typically manufactured with PVC insulation, bedding and a transparent PVC sheath. The transparent sheath means signs of deterioration, damage or corrosion can be detected with ease. 
SY has a voltage rating of 300/500V and meets the requirements of both BS6500 and VDE0250 standards.
Uses.
As well as automation and process control, SY Control Cable is used in the rail and transport industry, building and construction, and transmission, distribution and power networks. Found on assembly and production lines, conveyors, in computer units and machine tool manufacture, SY Cable is designed for use in fixed installations and as an interconnecting cable between fixed and mobile equipment.
Origin of the name SY.
In CENELEC code – the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation – the S in SY stands for steel wire braid, and the Y for PVC. SY Control Cable can be referred to more generally as Instrumentation Cable, Flexible or Braided Control Cable and Control Flex.
CY and YY Control Cables.
There are three different types of Control Cable in the area of process automation: CY, YY and SY Cable. With its GSWB braid SY is suited to installations with medium to high mechanical stress. YY and CY Control Cable are very similar in construction, but without the mechanical protection provided by the steel wire. YY is a versatile cable that works well in environments with only light mechanical stress and CY Cable has a tinned copper wire braid and polyester binder tape, which provide protection against external electromagnetic influences.

He said that there were bright prospects for Moldova and Austria to expand their bilateral mutually beneficial cooperation, and spoke up for more active Austrian investment in privatized Moldovan enterprises and for creating the legal framework to broaden the bilateral interaction.
In 2003 Vladimir Voronin, President of Moldova, participated at the 10th meeting of the heads of states from Central Europe in Salzburg, Austria, at a meeting that gave leaders from countries across the continent the chance to exchange ideas on an equal footing. In July 2007, Austrian State Secretary Hans Winkler met the Moldovan Deputy Foreign Minister, and stated that Moldova's course of reform was also in Austria's Interest.
In January 2008, Vladimir Voronin met the director general for external economic relations at the Austrian Federal Economy and Labour Ministry Johann Sachs on a visit to Moldova.

St Bartholomew's Church, Dublin

St Bartholomew's Church, Dublin, is a Church of Ireland parish church located on Clyde Road in Ballsbridge on the Southside of Dublin.
History.
St Bartholomew's Church, Clyde Road, was consecrated in 1867. Many of its original features are intact, such as the sanctuary mosaics and the elaborate wrought iron choir screen. The architect was Thomas Henry Wyatt. The rectory was built in 1872 by the architect James Edward Rogers.
According to 'An Irishman's Diary' on P. 15 of "The Irish Times" on Saturday, June 23rd, 2012, the parents of Alan Turing, O.B.E., F.R.S., were married in the church in October 1907. They were Julius Turing (1873–1947) and Ethel Stoney (1881–1976).
The church is the focal point of the civil parish of the same name in the barony of Dublin.
Liturgy.
St Bartholomew's Church maintains a liturgical tradition that is broadly related to that of the Anglo-Catholic tradition. Anglo-Catholicism distinguishes that section or party of the Anglican Communion which stems from the Tractarian Movement of the 1830s. (This movement was centred in Oxford and included such influential figures as John Henry Newman, one of the prime movers in the founding of University College, Dublin.) Anglo-Catholics hold a 'high' doctrine of the Church and the sacraments; they attach great importance to the apostolic succession, that is, to an episcopal order derived from the apostles; to the historical continuity of the existing Church with the Church of the earliest centuries; and to the Church's ultimate independence of the State.
Music.
The church is celebrated for its fine music. The choir of boys and men, the only remaining all-male parish church choir in the country, generally sings at least one of the choral services each Sunday during term-time. The remainder are sung by the girls' choir (formed eight years ago and now playing an increasingly prominent role in the church's regular worship as well as undertaking a programme of regular concerts and joint events around the city and country), the Elgin Chorale (which sings during choir vacations) and the newly formed chamber choir the Clyde Chorale.In recent years, the activities of the choir have expanded to include regular concert appearances. The boy choristers have sung many times in the National Concert Hall, Dublin, where their performances have included the War Requiem of Benjamin Britten and J.S.Bach's Saint Matthew Passion. The choirs' repertoire is fully representative of the major styles of choral music from the sixteenth century up to the present day. With its superb acoustic, splendid organ and convenient location, Saint Bartholomew's is becoming more widely known as an excellent concert venue. Details of forthcoming events and services can be found on the church's website.
The Organ.
The organ was built in 1887 by Gray & Davison. Rebuilt in 1925, it was then left largely unaltered until 1963 when another firm, J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd, undertook a major restoration. This rebuild changed the character of the organ but retained most of the original pipework and mechanism. The organ was last rebuilt by Trevor Crowe of Dublin in 2002.. Much of the original instrument's character was brought back by restoring the third manual. In addition, sophisticated technology was incorporated, allowing the player to program sequences of stops and pre-define stop combinations. The instrument was ingeniously fitted into a fairly small chamber on the north side of the building.
The first radio broadcast of an organ recital at the church was made in 1935.

Billa (2009 film)

Billa () is a 2009 Telugu gangster-thriller film film directed by Meher Ramesh, a remake of the 2007 Tamil Film of the same name. But some scenes were changed to suit the Telugu audience. It also drew inspirations from the NTR-starring Telugu film, "Yugandhar" (1979) which drew inspirations from another Hindi film titled "Don" and one of Rajinikanth's 1980 Tamil film with the same title. Prabhas Raju Uppalapati plays the lead role, where he plays dual roles of the characters Billa and Swami Ranga, with Anushka Shetty and Namitha playing the heroines. The film, which began in October 2008, released in April 2009. Actress Jayasudha, who had earlier starred in "Yugandhar" (1979) as Jaya, the first Telugu remake of "Don", has a guest role as Janaki in this film.
Plot.
The movie begins with an underworld don Billa (Prabhas), featured on Interpol's criminal list, hiding and operating out of Malaysia. ACP Krishnamoorthy (Krishnam Raju) has spent the last few years looking for Billa, leaving behind a life in India.
During a chase with the police Billa is severely wounded after an accident and dies in front of the ACP. The ACP then secretly holds a burial of Billa. Interpol Officer Dharmendra (Rahman) is assigned to work with the ACP to capture the elusive Billa as no-one knows of Billa's death. The ACP keeps the death of Billa as a secret even from his fellow officers, and tracks down a look-alike called Swami Ranga (Prabhas), a petty thief based in Visakhapatnam. He asks Ranga to infiltrate Billa's gang by pretending to be Billa. In return he will make sure that the children Ranga adopted, Lakshmi and Sreenu, get a proper education in Hyderabad.
The ACP trains Ranga and sends him back to Billa's gang as a person who has lost his memory. Slowly Ranga starts to learn about Billa's gang and even speaks to Devil, Billa's boss, on the phone. Ranga provides a pen drive with the secret information of the crime network to the ACP, but he is about to be killed by a woman named Maya (Anushka Shetty) because her brother Vikram (Subbaraju) as well as his fiancee Priya (Hansika Motwani) were killed by Billa. At this juncture, the ACP arrives and tells her that he is Ranga and not Billa. Since then, she begins to assist Ranga and the ACP in their mission and soon falls in love with Ranga. Later before a party, Ranga secretly provides information to the ACP about a meeting of Billa's network and Lisa (Namitha), Billa's girlfriend, overhears his conversation. She challenges Ranga but in the fight, he accidentally kills her. A shootout occurs at the party and the ACP is secretly killed by Devil, leaving his gun behind. Ranga finds the ACP's body and the gun, but is taken into the custody of the police team, now headed by Interpol Officer Dharmendra. He argues during interrogation that he is Ranga and not Billa to Dharmendra. Ranga mentions a piece of evidence - the pen drive which may prove his innocence but the pen drive is nowhere to be found.
Unable to prove his innocence, he escapes from a police van. He phones Dharmendra and ask him to meet at the Aero bridge. Here it is revealed that Dharmendra is none other than the Underworld Crime Don Devil and he is the one who killed ACP Krishnamoorthy. While escaping from Devil's gang, he meets Officer Adithya (Adithya), who apparently had the pen drive all along and strikes a deal with Ranga to get hold of Devil. Meanwhile, Maya has been kidnapped by Devil after she tried to defend Ranga from Devil. Ranga decides to pose as Billa to Devil, and provides Russian explosives to an arms dealer Rashid (Kelly Dorjee), who insisted on dealing with Billa. Enraged at being slighted by Rashid, following the completion of the deal, Devil and his henchman Ranjith fight with Ranga. Soon the police arrive and Devil, posing as Dharmendra, asks the police to arrest Ranga as Billa but gets shot by the squad of police and dies as the police have wired the entire conversation between Devil and Ranga, thus proving Ranga's innocence.
The movie ends with Ranga returning to Visakhapatnam with Maya, and deciding to start a school and college there with the government reward given to him and four suitcases of cash he stole from Malaysia.
Production.
The Below is Based on an interview by Meher Ramesh to Mr. Jeevi of idlebrain.com, which is one of the Famous telugu cine portals.
Development.
It was during the shooting of Vayassunami song for Kantri in Ramoji Film City, NTR asked me if I were interested watching Tamil Billa film. He got a print mailed from Chennai. He wanted to watch it because it was done by legend NTR as 'Yugandhar'. He said that if we like the movie, we might remake in Telugu immediately after Kantri film. I loved the film, but opined that NTR might not suit the role at this stage of his career and told him frankly about it.
I still had the idea of remaking Billa. The same producer came up with the proposal of remaking it with Ravi Teja as hero. I watched the movie again with Ravi Teja in my mind. I modified certain scenes to suit him. Then I opined that a high budget film might not work out with Ravi Teja as hero. The producer will end up suffering for the kind of budget we ask for. Hence we collectively decided not to make the movie.
I got an offer to work with Prabhas. I told him another story and he didn’t look excited enough. I casually asked him if he saw Billa. I told him that it has all elements of commercial hits like Rowdy Alludu and Donga Mogudu which Chiranjeevi has done in his peak time of the career. He loved it and I told him the script changes. We need a comfortable producer who can spend lot of money at the same time who doesn’t pressurize us. Prabhas suggested that we should make it on his home banner Gopi Krishna Movies. I told him another script which is equally exciting. It would cost only 60% of what Billa would have cost. But Prabhas wanted to make Billa. We narrated it to Krishnam Raju and he loved it. I wanted Krishnam Raju to do the role of police commissioner. I wanted to capture the first combination of Prabhas and Krishnam Raju.
I did some changes in screenplay. I made Billa an out and out commercial entertainer. I visualized every shot before making the movie. We went to Malaysia and selected the required locations a month in advance.
Casting.
Anushka: I knew Sweety (Anushka) even before she entered movies. It was me who introduced her to Puri Jagan for Super film. I told her that she is going to be paired up with Prabhas and I need her in best shape. She worked hard and when I met her after two months, she slimmed down a lot.
Hansika Motwani: I told Hansika that a slot done by Kareena Kapoor in Hindi Don is available and asked her if she is interested in doing that role. She trusted me and told yes immediately.
Namitha: I didn’t have Namitha in my mind for that character. I tried many new faces. Namitha asked me that she want to re-enter Telugu films with Billa film. She slimmed down for this role and we had a photo shoot before signing her.
Supreet: Supreet is highly impressive as Katraju in Chatrapati. He matched the masculinity of Prabhas in that film. I cast him as an associate of Billa in this film. He looks cool in black suits.
Rehman: Tamil actor Rehman did an important role as an associate of Krishnam Raju in this film. I noticed that he is also a perfectionist like Prakash Raj. He learnt each and every word of his dialogue before hand. He uttered all Telugu dialogues with no prompting.
Filming.
Most of the Indian and Bollywood films shot in Malaysia has William Wong as action director. But I have good tuning with Stun Siva. I employed Stun Siva as fight master for Billa and we took the help of William Wong whenever we required. We shot a chase that never came in Indian screen before. It will be like watching terrific chases in Bond flicks. We used choppers for 15 days. When we asked for 2 helicopters, producer granted us four. This credit should go to producer D Narendra and production designer Krishna. We stayed in Malaysia for 3 months at a stretch to shoot this movie.
I wanted to have either Sameer Reddy or Chota K Naidu for cinematography. But dates of both of them were not available. Not many people know about Soundar Rajan who worked as an associate to KV Anand in the past. He also worked for four forgettable Tamil flicks. He got busy in doing commercial ads. We wanted to shoot Billa with Super 35 camera. When I met him for the first time, we shared good vibes. We spoke for 5 hours about moviemaking. I signed him without looking at his work because I realized that he is extremely talented through our discussion. He is a friend of Vishnu Vardhan who directed Tamil Billa. We met Vishnu Vardhan and I informed him the changes I made in Billa script. He was impressed with it. Soundar is an excellent technician with amazing sense of using lenses. He is one of the reasons why Billa is made in less time with more quality.
Billa is shot in 104 working days. We shot this film in unpredictable weather of Malaysia. The total runtime of the final cut is 2 hours and 30 minutes.
Reviews.
Indiaglitz gave the verdict as "It is stylish, visually rich."
Audio.
Music of Billa was launched at a packed auditorium in Shilpakala Vedika on the night of 18 March 2009. Dasari Narayana Rao, S. S. Rajamouli, V. V. Vinayak, Gopichand and Allu Arjun graced the function as guests. Dasari Narayana Rao launched the music. Mani Sharma composed music for the film and Lahari music bought audio rights.

Detroit Cornice and Slate Company Building

The Detroit Cornice and Slate Company Building is a Beaux-Arts style industrial office building located at 733 St. Antoine Street (at East Lafayette Street) in Downtown Detroit, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974.
History.
The Detroit Cornice and Slate Company was started by Frank Hesse in 1888. In 1897, the company hired Harry J. Rill to design a Beaux-Arts three-story building for their use. The building was used by the company until 1972, when lack of storage and parking space forced the company to relocate in Ferndale. In 1974,the building was renovated for office and commercial use by architect Bill Kessler. In the 1990s, the "Metro Times" newspaper moved into the building; a wraparound addition was constructed to increase room for the newspaper. In 1999 William Kessler and Associates restored and made an addition to the building.
In July 2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan was finalizing the purchase of the Cornice and Slate Company Building, which had the "Metro Times" and Paxahau, an event production and management company that produces the Movement Electronic Music Festival. The Cornice and Slate building is adjacent to the BCBS Bricktown customer service facility. The acquisition of the Cornice and Slate building would add additional space to BCBS's Greektown facility. The ground floor lease to the Flood's Bar & Grille would be maintained while the Cornice and Slate second and third floors would be used as office space for about 100 BCBS employees. This means that the other tenants would be expected to move out of the building. Helen Stojic, director of corporate communications for BCBS, did not state the sale price of the building. BCBS was expected to close on the purchase in August 2013.
By July 16, 2013 Chris Sexson of the "Metro Times" stated that the publication had not yet made definitive plans for its new headquarters but was already looking for a new headquarters location. The acquisition forced the "Metro Times" to move. The newspaper leased space in a facility in Ferndale, Michigan.
Construction.
The facade of this building is constructed from finely crafted galvanized steel. These metal facades permitted elegant ornamentation to be constructed quickly and cheaply, particularly in locations like Detroit where stone was not easily obtainable. The Detroit Cornice and Slate Company itself fashioned many of the building's simulated carvings from sheet metal.

Moldova–Switzerland relations

Moldovan-Swiss relations are diplomatic, economic and other relations between Moldova and Switzerland. Both countries established diplomatic relations on September 2, 1992. Moldova is represented in Switzerland through its embassy to the United Nations in Geneva. Switzerland is represented in Moldova through its embassy in Kiev (Ukraine) and an honorary consulate in Chişinău. Since 1992 various senior Moldovan officials have visited Switzerland to discuss improvements in bilteral relations. Switzerland has provided significant aid to Moldova.
Official visits and statements.
In April 1992 the Swiss military attaché in Moscow said that Switzerland intended to establish links between the Swiss and Moldovan military institutions and assist Moldova in strengthening defense capabilities.
In January 1999 Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi visited Switzerland, and stated that progress had been made in broadening bilateral relations between the two countries.
In October 2006, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Switzerland to Moldova Christian Fessler stated that Switzerland supports Moldova's European integration efforts, and hoped for a peaceful settlement of the Transnistria conflict.
In June 2008, the Moldovan Vice-Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration Andrei Stratan visited Switzerland and met with senior officials to discuss improvements in bilateral relations, including visa arrangements and joint cooperation efforts in the social, tourism and education sectors. They noted plans to open an embassy of Switzerland in Chişinău.
In December 2008 Valery Ostalep, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Moldova, visited Switzerland and met with senior officials to discuss opportunities for improved economic relations.
Agreements.
As of 2008, Moldova and Switzerland had signed a dozen agreements, half of which were economic.
Aid.
In 1996 it was reported that the Swiss-American Micro-Enterprise Programme would lend money for small loans to assist Moldova's micro-enterprises. Switzerland's State Secretariat for Economic Affairs funded a project in 2005 to assist the Moldovan Ministry of Economy and Commerce in improving levels of foreign direct investment.
The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) has been active in Moldova since 2000, providing humanitarian aid. The SDC gave support to the International Organization for Migration in 2001 to start a reintegration program for the victims of trafficking in women. The Lausanne-based Terre des hommes has been active in Moldova since 2005, giving support and training to authorities in protecting children at risk of parental neglect, abuse, exploitation and trafficking. The Swiss Tropical Institute has provided assistance to Moldova since 2006 in improvements in perinatal treatment.
Economic relations.
Switzerland is Moldova's 14th most important trading partner.
In July 2000, the president of the Swiss airline Crossair met with Moldovan President, Petru Lucinschi and expressed readiness to extend the partnership with the state-owned Air Moldova, and to take part in the privatization of the Air Moldova. The Moldovan government was also negotiating with Swiss-based Militzer & Münch about a concession to run the Moldovan National Railroad Company. Alain Benech of the Secretariat for Economy of the Switzerland Foreign Department stated in an interview that there were many opportunities for Swiss business in Moldova.
In December 2008, Moldovan entrepreneurs in Switzerland attended a forum organized by the newly formed Switzerland-Moldova Chamber of Commerce, with guest speakers Pierre-François Unger, Minister of Economy and Health of the Canton of Geneva and Moldovan Minister of Finance Marian Durleshtyanu.
Miscellaneous.
In June 2003 Swiss parliamentarian Ruth-Gaby Vermot-Mangold presented a report on organ trafficking to the Council of Europe, including evidence gathered in Moldova. This has prompted Swiss authorities to consider new legislation to prevent abuse of organ donations.

Belgium–Ukraine relations

Belgium–Ukraine relations are foreign relations between Belgium and Ukraine. Diplomatic relations were established in 1992. Belgium has an embassy in Kiev; Ukraine has an embassy in Brussels and two honorary consulates (in Antwerp and Mons). Although politically the two nations are not closely connected, they have a long history of economic integration and trade, with Belgian investment playing a role in the contemporary Ukrainian economy. As of 2008, trade revenue generated between the two nations accounted for approximately USD1 billion.
History.
Trade links between Kievan Rus' and Flanders and what is now Belgium were established as early as the 11th century. By 1600, trade between the two regions had developed fully, particularly that of textiles and jewellery. Merchants from Kiev arrived in Flanders with furs and purchased textiles. In return merchants transported wool and amber jewellery to Lviv in exchange of furs, silk and oriental seasoning.
At the turn of the 20th century, Belgian manufacturers played a major role in the industrial growth of Ukraine. The first lines of the electric tramway in Kiev and Odessa were constructed by the Belgian company “Tractebel”. This company is still active in the Ukrainian infrastructure.
Economic relations.
Traditional ties between the two regions have continued and trade and economic cooperation between Ukraine and Belgium has continued to develop. Between 1999 to 2003 the bulk of exports to Ukraine doubled, with the Belgian Agency for Foreign Trade figures revealing an increase again in 2004 by 23.47% and amounted to 209,872 million euros. 
Although textile trading has declined in significance, the industrial relationship between the regions, especially in the manufacturing sector, is a major one. As of 2008 trade between the two nations accounted for US$ 1 billion. Ukraine is a notable exporter to Belgium of precious metals and minerals, oil products and chemicals whilst Belgium is a major supplier to Ukraine of machines, industrial and electrotechnical equipment, chemicals, rubber, and also certain metals. The nations are also connected in the beer industry, with the Belgian brewing company Interbrew having a share of 34.3% in the Ukrainian beer market, thanks to its cooperation with the Ukrainian brewers of Chernigiv, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. General Belgian investments in the economy of Ukraine had grown rapidly and as of July 2008, some US$ 44 million was put in the Ukrainian economy by Belgian investors, with 31.5% into wholesale trade, 16% into transport and communications, 15% into the food-processing industry (15%) and 13% into mechanical engineering respectively. A number of Ukrainian companies are primarily financed by Belgian investment.
In October 2008, the two nations became further integrated in the agricultural sector too when Belgian firm Rattlerow Seghers and Ukrainian Elita Farms signed an agreement to develop pig production in Ukraine.
Rattlerow Seghers delivered the first shipment breeding stock consisting of 192 pigs from Belgium to Elita Farms in Ukraine in January 2009. Rattlerow Seghers had exported the first breeding animals to Ukraine in 2004 and pigs have been successfully marketed using Belgian stock since the beginning of 2005, witnessing a growing demand and pressure to run larger pig farms in the country. The agreement in 2009 was made after close negotiations between the government institutes of both countries and important figures in the agricultural sector, both politically through representation and within the industry itself. Notable figures in the agreement included the Minister of Agriculture of Ukraine, Melnik Yuriy Fedorovych. The agreement not only supplies breeding stock but also expert knowledge from Belgium and training programs to enhance the efficiency of the Ukrainian pig industry and facilitate growth and production after a period of economic decline.
Political relations.
Belgium became connected diplomatically with Ukraine at the beginning of the Soviet Union around 1919, but since the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine in 1991 new relations have been established since March 10, 1992. Belgium along with other European states formally recognised the independence of Ukraine on 31 December 1991. Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of an independent modern Ukraine, paid a diplomatic visit to Brussels in July 1992. On a parliamentary level, both Ukraine and Belgium have deputies and ambassadors functioning in the parliaments of both countries. Aside from national political connections, there are ties at a city level, particularly between the capitals of Kiev and Brussels and the twin cities of Donetsk and Charleroi, but also regionally between the Poltava region and Hainaut province. About 4,000 people involved in bilateral relations between Ukraine and Belgium.
In 2008 Belgium and Ukraine delegates including the Minister of Economic Affairs of Ukraine, Bohdan Danylyshyn, and the Minister for Belgian Enterprises, Vincent Van Kikenborn, met at the Ukrainian-Belgian Intergovernmental Joint Commission to discuss problems of bilateral trade, economic and financial relations between the two nations focusing on a 1997 treaty. In the meeting Danylyshyn revealed that Ukraine considers Belgian investment and the wider European Union alliance as of major importance to the Ukrainian economy as it becomes integrated in the world market. During the meeting, new investment projects were discussed into various sectors of the economy and the further development of transport industry, logistics, agriculture and tourism. Mutual obligations to comply to fossil fuel targets, energy conservation and the need to increase the use of alternative sources of energy between the two nations within the wider global framework were also discussed.
On March 23, 2009. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko
travelled to Brussels for an international investment conference to discuss the modernisation of Ukraine's gas transit system and supplies.
Cultural relations.
Expositions are regularly held in the most esteemed galleries of Brussels and other major Belgian cities, and Ukrainian artwork (both sculpture and painting) has a considerable following in Belgium. In regard to music, the National Symphonic Orchestra of Ukraine, Orchestra of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Military Band of the Southern Operational Command HQ of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and various Kiev based choirs and orchestras such as Kyiv Classic Orchestra regularly perform in Belgium. In addition the Academic Symphonic Orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine was conducted by the Belgian conductor Ronald Zollman. On April 4, 2009 a gala concert by the Academic Symphonic Orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine was held in Kiev to commemorate 60 years of NATO. Organized by the NATO Information and Documentation Centre (NIDC) in conjunction with the embassies of Belgium and Slovakia, the Belgian Ambassador Mark Vinck spoke out at the event and the importance of music in good international relations, noting that the anniversary was “a timely occasion to recall the Alliance’s major contribution to peace and security in Europe and in the wider world, and to stress how much important it is to continue to strengthen the relations with Ukraine, but also to develop good relations with all neighboring countries.” 
A number of monuments in Belgium commemorate Ukrainian figures or history. One notable example is the "Holodomor" monument by Mykola Telizhenko which was erected in 2003 at St. Michael Cathedral in Genk to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Holodomor.

Dutch language

Dutch () is a West Germanic language and the native language of most of the population of the Netherlands, and about sixty percent of the populations of Belgium and Suriname, the three member states of the Dutch Language Union. Most speakers live in the European Union, where it is a first language for about 23 million and a second language for another 5 million people.
Dutch also holds official status in the Caribbean island nations of Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, while Dutch or dialects assigned to it continue to be spoken, in parts of France and Germany, and to a lesser extent, in Indonesia,A dialect continuum exists between Dutch and German through the South Guelderish and Limburgish dialects.In 1941, 400,000 Indonesians spoke Dutch, and Dutch exerted a major influence on Indonesian; see . In 1941, about 0.5% of the inland population had a reasonable knowledge of Dutch; see . At the beginning of World War II, about one million Asians had an active command of Dutch, while an additional half million had a passive knowledge; see . Many older Indonesians speak Dutch as a second language; see . Some of the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia speak Dutch amongst each other; see , . Dutch is spoken by "smaller groups of speakers" in Indonesia; see . Some younger Indonesians learn Dutch as a foreign language because their parents and grandparents may speak it and because in some circles, Dutch is regarded as the language of the elite; see . At present, only educated people of the oldest generation, in addition to specialists for which knowledge of the language is required, can speak Dutch fluently; see . Around 25% of present-day Indonesian vocabulary can be traced back to Dutch words, see .</ref> and up to half a million native Dutch speakers may be living in the United States, Canada, and Australia. The Cape Dutch dialects of Southern Africa have been standardised into Afrikaans, a mutually intelligible daughter language of DutchAfrikaans was historically called Cape Dutch; see , , , , , .
Afrikaans is rooted in 17th century dialects of Dutch; see , , , .
Afrikaans is variously described as a creole, a partially creolised language, or a deviant variety of Dutch; see .</ref> which today is spoken to some degree by an estimated total of 15 to 23 million people in South Africa and Namibia.
Dutch is closely related to German and English and is said to be between them. Apart from not having undergone the High German consonant shift, Dutch—like English—has mostly abandoned the grammatical case system, does not use Germanic umlaut as a grammatical marker, and has levelled much of its morphology. Dutch has three grammatical genders, but this distinction has fewer grammatical consequences than in German. Dutch shares with German the use of subject–verb–object word order in main clauses and subject–object–verb in subordinate clauses. Dutch vocabulary is mostly Germanic and contains the same Germanic core as German and English, while incorporating more Romance loans than German and fewer than English.
Names.
While "Dutch" generally refers to the language as a whole, Belgian varieties are sometimes collectively referred to as "Flemish". In both Belgium and the Netherlands, the native official name for Dutch is "Nederlands", and its dialects have their own names, e.g. "Hollands" "Hollandish", "West-Vlaams" "Western Flemish", "Limburgs" "Limburgish", "Brabants" "Brabantian".
The language has been known under a variety of names. In Middle Dutch, "dietsc" (in the South) and "diutsc", "duutsc" (in the North) were used to refer variably to Dutch, Low German, and German. This word is derived from "diet" "people" and was used to translate Latin "(lingua) vulgaris" "popular language" to set apart the Germanic vernacular from Latin (the language of writing and the Church) and Romance. An early form of this word appears Latinized in the Strasbourg Oaths (AD 842) as "teudisca (lingua)" to refer to the Rhenish Franconian portion of the oath and also underlies dialectal French "thiois" "Luxembourgish", "Lorraine Franconian".
During the Renaissance in the 16th century, "duytsch" (modern "Duits") "German" and "nederduytsch" "Low German" began to be differentiated from "dietsch" or "nederlandsch" "Dutch", a distinction that is echoed in English later the same century with the terms "High Dutch" "German" and "Low Dutch" "Dutch". However, owing to Dutch commercial and colonial rivalry in the 16th and 17th centuries, the English term came to refer exclusively to the Dutch. In modern Dutch, "Duits" has narrowed in meaning to refer to "German", "Diets" went out of common use because of its Nazi associations and now somewhat romantically refers to older forms of Dutch, whereas "Hollands" and "Vlaams" are sometimes used to name the language as a whole for the varieties spoken in respectively the Netherlands and Belgium.
"Nederlands", the official Dutch word for "Dutch", did not become firmly established until the 19th century. The repeated use of "neder"- or "low" to refer to the language is a reference to the Netherlands' downriver location at the mouth of the Rhine (harking back to Latin nomenclature, e.g. "Germania inferior" vs. "Germania superior") and its position at the lowest dip of the Northern European plain.
Classification.
Dutch belongs to its own West Germanic sub-group, West Low Franconian, paired with its sister language Limburgish, or East Low Franconian, both of which stand out by mixing characteristics of Low German and High German. Dutch is at one end of a dialect continuum known as the Rhenish fan where German gradually turns into Dutch. There was also at one time a dialect continuum that blurred the boundary between Dutch and Low German. In some small areas, there are still dialect continua, but they are gradually becoming extinct.
All three languages have shifted earlier > , show final-obstruent devoicing (Du "brood" "bread" ), and experienced lengthening of short vowels in stressed open syllables which has led to contrastive vowel length that is used as a morphological marker. Dutch stands out from Low German and High German in its retention of the clusters and , while shifting of to . It also did not develop i-mutation as a morphological marker, although some eastern dialects did. In earlier periods, Low Franconian of either sort differed from Low German by maintaining a three-way plural verb conjugation (Old Dutch -"un", -"it", -"unt" → Middle Dutch -"en", -"t", -"en").
In modern Dutch, the former 2nd-person plural (-"t") took the place of the 2nd-person singular, and the plural endings were reduced into a single form -"en" (cf. Du "jij maakt" "you(sg) make" vs. "wij/jullie/zij maken" "we/you(pl)/they make"). However, it is still possible to distinguish it from German (which has retained the three-way split) and Low German (which has -"t" in the present tense: "wi/ji/se niemmet" "we/you(pl)/they take"). Dutch and Low German show the collapsing of older "ol"/"ul"/"al" + dental into "ol" + dental, but in Dutch wherever /l/ was pre-consonantal and after a short vowel, it vocalized, e.g., Du "goud" "gold", "zout" "salt", "woud" "woods" : LG "Gold", "Solt", "Woold" : Germ "Gold", "Salz", "Wald".

Dutch shares with German:
Geographic distribution.
Dutch is an official language of the Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname, Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten. Dutch is also an official language of several international organisations, such as the European Union and the Union of South American Nations. It is used unofficially in the Caribbean Community.
Europe.
Netherlands.
Dutch is the official and foremost language of the Netherlands, a nation of 16.7 million people of whom 96 percent speak Dutch as their mother tongue. In the province of Friesland and a small part of Groningen, Frisian is also recognised and is spoken by a few hundred thousand Frisians. In the Netherlands there are many different dialects, but these are often overruled and replaced by the language of the media, school, government (i.e., Standard Dutch).
Immigrant languages are Indonesian, Turkish, English, Spanish, German, Berber, Moroccan Arabic, Papiamento, and Sranan. In the second generation these newcomers often speak Dutch as their mother tongue, sometimes alongside the language of their parents.
Belgium.
Belgium, a nation of 11 million people, has three official languages, which are, in order from the largest speaker population to the smallest, Dutch (sometimes colloquially referred to as "Flemish"), French, and German. An estimated 59% of all Belgians speak Dutch as their first language, while French is the mother tongue of 40%.
Dutch is the official language of the Flemish Region (where it is the mother tongue of about 97% of the population) and one of the two official languages —along with French— of the Brussels Capital Region. Dutch is not official nor a recognised minority language in the Walloon Region, although on the border with the Flemish Region, there are four municipalities with language facilities for Dutch speakers. The most important Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium are West Flemish (also spoken in French Flanders), East Flemish, Brabantian, and Limburgish, the latter having a dialect continuum in northeastern Wallonia and adjacent areas of Germany (as Low Dietsch).
Brussels.
Since the founding of the Kingdom of Belgium in 1830, Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely Dutch-speaking, with a small French minority, to being a multilingual city with French as the majority language and lingua franca. This language shift, the Frenchification of Brussels, is rooted in the 18th century but accelerated after Belgium became independent and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries.
Not only is French-speaking immigration responsible for the frenchification of Brussels, but more importantly the language change over several generations from Dutch to French was performed in Brussels by the Flemish people themselves. The main reason for this was the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time. From 1880 on more and more Dutch-speaking people became bilingual resulting in a rise of monolingual French speakers after 1910. Halfway through the 20th century the number of monolingual French speakers carried the day over the (mostly) bilingual Flemish inhabitants.
Only since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian language border and the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use. This phenomenon is, together with the future of Brussels, one of the most controversial topics in all of Belgian politics.
Today an estimated 16 percent of city residents are native speakers of Dutch, while an additional 13 percent claim to have a "good to excellent" knowledge of Dutch.
France.
French Flemish, a variant of West Flemish, is spoken in the north-east of France by an estimated population of 20,000 daily speakers and 40,000 occasional speakers. It is spoken alongside French, which is gradually replacing it for all purposes and in all areas of communication. Neither Dutch nor its regional French Flemish variant is afforded legal status in France, either by the central or regional public authorities, by the education system or before the courts. In brief, the state takes no measures to ensure the use of Dutch in France.
In the 9th century the Germanic–Romance language border went from the mouth of the Canche to just north of the city of Lille, where it coincided with the present language border in Belgium. From the late 9th century on, the border gradually started to shift northward and eastward to the detriment of the Germanic language.
Boulogne-sur-Mer was bilingual up to the 12th century, Calais up to the 16th century, and Saint-Omer until the 18th century. The western part of the County of Flanders, consisting of the castellanies of Bourbourg, Bergues, Cassel and Bailleul, became part of France between 1659 and 1678. However, the linguistic situation in this formerly monolingually Dutch-speaking region did not dramatically change until the French Revolution in 1789, and Dutch continued to fulfil the main functions of a cultural language throughout the 18th century.
During the 19th century, especially in the second half of it, Dutch was banned from all levels of education and lost most of its functions as a cultural language. The cities of Dunkirk, Gravelines and Bourbourg had become predominantly French-speaking by the end of the 19th century. In the countryside, until World War I, many elementary schools continued to teach in Dutch, and the Roman Catholic Church continued to preach and teach the cathechism in Flemish in many parishes.
Nonetheless, since French enjoyed a much higher status than Dutch, from about the interbellum onward everybody became bilingual, the generation born after World War II being raised exclusively in French. In the countryside, the passing on of Flemish stopped during the 1930s or 1940s. As a consequence, the vast majority of those still having an active command of Flemish belong to the generation of over the age of 60. Therefore, complete extinction of French Flemish can be expected in the coming decades.
Asia.
Despite the Dutch presence in Indonesia for almost 350 years, the Dutch language has no official status there and the small minority that can speak the language fluently are either educated members of the oldest generation, or employed in the legal profession, as some legal codes are still only available in Dutch. Many universities include Dutch as a source language, mainly for law and history students (roughly 35,000 of them nationally).
Unlike other European nations, the Dutch chose not to follow a policy of language expansion amongst the indigenous peoples of their colonies. In the last quarter of the 19th century, however, a local elite gained proficiency in Dutch so as to meet the needs of expanding bureaucracy and business. Nevertheless, the Dutch government remained reluctant to teach Dutch on a large scale for fear of destabilising the colony. Dutch, the language of power, was supposed to remain in the hands of the leading elite.
Instead, use of local languages —or, where this proved to be impractical, of Malay— was encouraged. As a result, fewer than 2% of Indonesians could speak Dutch in 1940. Only when in 1928 the Indonesian nationalist movement had chosen Malay as a weapon against Dutch influence, the colonial authorities gradually began to introduce Dutch into the educational curriculum. But because of the chaos of the 1942 Japanese invasion and the subsequent Indonesian independence in 1945, this shift in policy did not come into full effect.
After independence, Dutch was dropped as an official language and replaced by Malay. Yet the Indonesian language inherited many words from Dutch: words for everyday life as well as scientific and technological terms. One scholar argues that 20% of Indonesian words can be traced back to Dutch words, many of which are transliterated to reflect phonetic pronunciation e.g. "kantoor" (Dutch for "office") in Indonesian is "kantor", while "bus" ("bus") becomes "bis".
In addition, many Indonesian words are calques on Dutch, for example, "rumah sakit" (Indonesian for "hospital") is calqued on the Dutch "ziekenhuis" (literally "sick house"), "kebun binatang" ("zoo") on "dierentuin" (literally "animal garden"), "undang-undang dasar" ("constitution") from "grondwet" (literally "basic law"). These account for some of the differences in vocabulary between Indonesian and Malay.
The first spelling system for Indonesian, devised by Charles van Ophuijsen was influenced by Dutch, with the use of Dutch letter combinations such as "oe". For example, "tempo doeloe" (meaning "the past") was pronounced as "dulu". In 1947, this was changed to "u", hence "tempo dulu". However, the letter combination "oe" continued to be used in people's names, e.g. the first two Presidents of Indonesia, Sukarno and Suharto, are often written as "Soekarno" and "Soeharto". In 1972, following an agreement with Malaysia to harmonise the spelling of Indonesian and Malay, other Dutch-influenced letter combinations were replaced, e.g. "tj" and "dj" became "c" and "j", respectively. For instance "tjap" ("brand" in Indonesian) became "cap" and "Djakarta", the country's capital, became "Jakarta".
Dutch-based creole languages spoken (now or formerly) in the Dutch East Indies include Javindo and Petjo, most of whose speakers were Indo or Eurasians. As a result of Indo emigration to the Netherlands following independence, the use of these languages declined.
The century and half of Dutch rule in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and southern India left few traces of the Dutch language. A few words such as "tapal", "kokin" and "kakhuis" are still used in some of the Indian languages.
Oceania.
After the declaration of independence of Indonesia, Western New Guinea remained a Dutch colony until 1962, known as Netherlands New Guinea. Despite prolonged Dutch presence, the Dutch language is not spoken by many Papuans, the colony having been ceded to Indonesia in 1963.
Immigrant communities can be found in Australia and New Zealand. The 2006 Australian census showed 36,179 people speaking Dutch at home. At the 2006 New Zealand Census, 26,982 people, or 0.70 percent of the total population, reported to speak Dutch to sufficient fluency that they could hold an everyday conversation.
Americas.
In contrast to the colonies in the East Indies, from the second half of the 19th century onwards, the Netherlands envisaged expansion of Dutch in its colonies in the West Indies. Until 1863, when slavery was abolished in the West Indies, slaves were forbidden to speak Dutch. Most important were the efforts of Christianisation through Dutchification, which did not occur in Indonesia owing to a policy of non-involvement in the Islamised regions. Secondly, most of the people in the Colony of Surinam (now Suriname) worked on Dutch plantations, which reinforced the importance of Dutch as a means for direct communication. In Indonesia, the colonial authorities had less interference in economic life. The size of the population was decisive: whereas the Antilles and Surinam combined only had a few hundred thousand inhabitants, Indonesia had many millions, by far outnumbering the population of the Netherlands.
Suriname.
In Suriname, where in the second half of the 19th century the Dutch authorities introduced a policy of assimilation, Dutch is the sole official language and over 60 percent of the population speaks it as a mother tongue. A further twenty-four percent of the population speaks Dutch as a second language. Suriname gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1975 and has been an associate member of the Dutch Language Union since 2004. The lingua franca of Suriname, however, is Sranan Tongo, spoken natively by about a fifth of the population.
Caribbean.
In Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, all parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Dutch is the official language but spoken as a first language by only 7% to 8% of the population, although most native-born people on the islands can speak the language since the education system is in Dutch at some or all levels. The lingua franca of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao is Papiamento, a creole language that originally developed among the slave population. The population of the three northern Antilles, Sint Maarten, Saba, and Sint Eustatius, is predominantly English-speaking.
North America.
In New Jersey in the United States, an almost extinct dialect of Dutch, Jersey Dutch, spoken by descendants of 17th-century Dutch settlers in Bergen and Passaic counties, was still spoken as late as 1921. Other Dutch-based creole languages once spoken in the Americas include Mohawk Dutch (in Albany, New York), Berbice (in Guyana), Skepi (in Essequibo, Guyana) and Negerhollands (in the United States Virgin Islands). Pennsylvania Dutch is not a member of the set of Dutch dialects and is less misleadingly called Pennsylvania German.
Martin Van Buren, the eighth President of the United States, spoke Dutch as his first language and is the only U.S. President to have spoken a language other than English as his first language. Dutch prevailed for many generations as the dominant language in parts of New York along the Hudson River. Another famous American born in this region who spoke Dutch as a first language was Sojourner Truth.
According to the 2000 United States census, 150,396 people spoke Dutch at home, while according to the 2006 Canadian census, this number reaches 160,000 Dutch speakers. In Canada, Dutch is the fourth most spoken language by farmers, after English, French and German, and the fifth most spoken non-official language overall (by 0.6% of Canadians).
Africa.
Belgian Africa.
Belgium, which had gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1830, also held a colonial empire from 1901 to 1962, consisting of the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi. Unlike Belgium itself, the colonies had no de jure official language. Although a majority of Belgians residing in the colonies were Dutch-speaking, French was de facto the sole language used in administration, jurisdiction and secondary education.
After World War II, proposals of dividing the colony into a French-speaking and a Dutch-speaking part—after the example of Belgium—were discussed within the Flemish Movement. In general, however, the Flemish Movement was not as strong in the colonies as in the mother country. Although in 1956, on the eve of Congolese independence, an estimated 50,000 out of a total of 80,000 Belgian nationals would have been Flemish, only 1,305 out of 21,370 children were enrolled in Dutch-language education.
When the call for a better recognition of Dutch in the colony got louder, the "évolués" ("developed Congolese")—among them Mobutu Sese Seko—argued that Dutch had no right over the indigenous languages, defending the privileged position of French. Moreover, the image of Afrikaans as the language of the apartheid was injurious to the popularity of Dutch.
The colonial authorities used Lingala, Kongo, Swahili and Tshiluba in communication with the local population and in education. In Ruanda-Urundi this was Kirundi. Knowledge of French—or, to an even lesser extent, Dutch—was hardly passed on to the natives, of whom only a small number were taught French to work in local public services. After their independence, French would become an official language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. Of these, Congo is the most francophone country. Knowledge of Dutch in former Belgian Africa is virtually nonexistent.
Afrikaans.
[[File:South Africa Afrikaans speakers proportion map.svg|thumb|The distribution of Afrikaans across South Africa: proportion of the population speaking Afrikaans in the home.
The largest legacy of the Dutch language lies in South Africa, which attracted large numbers of Dutch, Flemish and other northwest European farmer (in Dutch, "boer") settlers, all of whom were quickly assimilated. After the colony passed into British hands in the early 19th century, the settlers spread into the hinterland, taking their language with them. The earlier century-long isolation from the rest of the Dutch-speaking world made the Dutch as spoken in Southern Africa evolve into what is now Afrikaans. 
European Dutch remained the literary language until the early 20th century, when under pressure of Afrikaner nationalism the local "African" Dutch was preferred over the written, European-based standard. In 1925, section 137 of the 1909 constitution of the Union of South Africa was amended by Act 8 of 1925, stating "the word "Dutch" in article 137 [...] is hereby declared to include Afrikaans". The constitution of 1983 only listed English and Afrikaans as official languages. It is estimated that between 90% to 95% of Afrikaans vocabulary is ultimately of Dutch origin.
Both languages are still largely mutually intelligible, although this relation can in some fields (such as lexicon, spelling and grammar) be asymmetric, as it is easier for Dutch speakers to understand written Afrikaans than it is for Afrikaans speakers to understand written Dutch. Afrikaans is grammatically far less complex than Dutch, and vocabulary items are generally altered in a clearly patterned manner, e.g. "vogel" becomes "voël" ("bird") and "regen" becomes "reën" ("rain").
It is the third language of South Africa in terms of native speakers (~13.5%), of whom 53 percent are Coloureds and 42.4 percent Whites. In 1996, 40 percent of South Africans reported to know Afrikaans at least at a very basic level of communication. It is the lingua franca in Namibia, where it is spoken natively in 11 percent of households. In total, Afrikaans is the first language in South Africa alone of about 6.8 million people and is estimated to be a second language for at least 10 million people worldwide, compared to over 23 million and 5 million respectively, for Dutch.
History.
The history of the Dutch language begins around AD 450–500 after Old Frankish, one of the many West Germanic tribal languages, was split by the Second Germanic consonant shift. At more or less the same time the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law led to the development of the direct ancestors of modern Dutch Low Saxon, Frisian and English. The northern dialects of Old Frankish generally did not participate in either of these two shifts, except for a small amount of phonetic changes, and are hence known as Old Low Franconian; the "Low" refers to dialects not influenced by the consonant shift.
The most south-eastern dialects of the Franconian languages became part of High—though not Upper—German even though a dialect continuum remained. The fact that Dutch did not undergo the sound changes may be the reason why some people say that Dutch is like a bridge between English and German. Within Old Low Franconian there were two subgroups: Old East Low Franconian and Old West Low Franconian, which is better known as Old Dutch.
East Low Franconian was eventually absorbed by Dutch as it became the dominant form of Low Franconian, although it remains a noticeable substrate within the southern Limburgish dialects of Dutch. As the two groups were so similar, it is often difficult to determine whether a text is Old Dutch or Old East Low Franconian; hence most linguists will generally use Old Dutch synonymously with Old Low Franconian and mostly do not differentiate.
Development phases.
Dutch, like other Germanic languages, is conventionally divided into three development phases which were:
The transition between these languages was very gradual and one of the few moments linguists can detect somewhat of a revolution is when the Dutch standard language emerged and quickly established itself. Standard Dutch is very similar to most Dutch dialects.
The development of the Dutch language is illustrated by the following sentence in Old, Middle and Modern Dutch:
A process of standardisation started in the Middle Ages, especially under the influence of the Burgundian Ducal Court in Dijon (Brussels after 1477). The dialects of Flanders and Brabant were the most influential around this time. The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century, mainly based on the urban dialect of Antwerp. In 1585 Antwerp fell to the Spanish army: many fled to the Northern Netherlands, especially the province of Holland, where they influenced the urban dialects of that province. In 1637, a further important step was made towards a unified language, when the Statenvertaling, the first major Bible translation into Dutch, was created that people from all over the United Provinces could understand. It used elements from various, even Dutch Low Saxon, dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland.
Phonology.
This section gives only a general overview of the phonemes of Dutch. For further details on different realisations of phonemes, dialectal differences and example words, see the full article at Dutch phonology.
Consonants.
Like most Germanic languages, the Dutch consonant system did not undergo the High German consonant shift and has a syllable structure that allows fairly complex consonant clusters. Dutch also retains full use of the velar fricatives that were present in Proto-Germanic, but lost or modified in many other Germanic languages.
Dutch has final-obstruent devoicing: at the end of a word, voicing distinction is neutralised and all obstruents are pronounced voiceless. For example, "goede" ("good") is but the related form "goed" is .
Notes:
Vowels.
Dutch has an extensive vowel inventory, as is common for Germanic languages. Vowels can be grouped as back rounded, front unrounded and front rounded. They are also traditionally distinguished by length or tenseness.
Vowel length is not always considered a distinctive feature in Dutch phonology, because it normally co-occurs with changes in vowel quality. One feature or the other may be considered redundant, and some phonemic analyses prefer to treat it as an opposition of tenseness. However, even if not considered part of the phonemic opposition, the long/tense vowels are still realised as "phonetically" longer than their short counterparts. The changes in vowel quality are also not always the same in all dialects, and in some there may be little difference at all, with length remaining the primary distinguishing feature. And while it is true that older words always pair vowel length with a change in vowel quality, new loanwords have reintroduced phonemic oppositions of length. Compare "zonne(n)" ("suns") versus "zone" ("zone") versus "zonen" ("sons"), or "kroes" ("mug") versus "cruise" ("cruise").
Notes:
Dutch also has several diphthongs. All of them end in a close vowel (), but may begin with a variety of other vowels. They are grouped here by their first element.
Notes:
Phonotactics.
The syllable structure of Dutch is (C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C). Many words, as in English, begin with three consonants; for example, straat "(street)". There are words that end in four consonants, e.g., "herfst" 'autumn', "ergst" 'worst', "interessantst" 'most interesting', "sterkst" 'strongest', the last three of which are superlative adjectives.
The highest number of consonants in a single cluster is found in the word "slechtstschrijvend" 'writing worst' with 7 consonant phonemes. Similar is "angstschreeuw" "scream in fear", with six in a row. It has to be noted though that the pronunciation of a word can differ greatly from its written form. In "slechtstschrijvend" the cluster is usually reduced because of assimilation > , or further by reducing > . The word "angstschreeuw" is similarly reduced to or .
Polder Dutch.
A notable deviation from the official pronunciation of Standard Dutch in younger generations in the Netherlands has been dubbed "Polder Dutch" by Jan Stroop. The diphthongs spelt , , and are pronounced not as , , and , but lowered, as , , and respectively. Instead, , , and are pronounced as diphthongs now, as , , and respectively, which makes this change an instance of a chain shift.
This change is interesting from a sociolinguistic point of view because it has apparently happened relatively recently, in the 1970s, and was pioneered by older well-educated women from the upper middle classes. The lowering of the diphthongs has long been current in many Dutch dialects, and is comparable to the English Great Vowel Shift, and the diphthongisation of long high vowels in Modern High German, which centuries earlier reached the state now found in Polder Dutch. Stroop theorizes that the lowering of open-mid to open diphthongs is a phonetically "natural" and inevitable development and that Dutch, after having diphthongised the long high vowels like German and English, "should" have lowered the diphthongs like German and English as well.
Instead, he argues, this development has been artificially frozen in an "intermediate" state by the standardisation of Dutch pronunciation in the 16th century, where lowered diphthongs found in rural dialects were perceived as ugly by the educated classes and accordingly declared substandard. Now, however, in his opinion, the newly affluent and independent women can afford to let that natural development take place in their speech. Stroop compares the role of Polder Dutch with the urban variety of British English pronunciation called Estuary English.
Among Belgian Dutch speakers, this vowel shift is not taking place, as the diphthongs , and are often pronounced as the monophthongs , and . Speakers using such pronunciations have no phonemic diphthongs in their inventory.
Grammar.
Dutch is grammatically similar to German, such as in syntax and verb morphology (for a comparison of verb morphology in English, Dutch and German, see Germanic weak verb and Germanic strong verb). Dutch has grammatical cases, but these are now mostly limited to pronouns and a large number of set phrases. Inflected forms of the articles are also often found in surnames and toponyms.
Originally, Dutch had three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter, although for many speakers, masculine and feminine have merged to form the common gender (de), while the neuter (het) remains distinct as before. This gender system is similar to those of most Continental Scandinavian languages. Many Belgian speakers still make a clear distinction between masculine and feminine words (see Gender in Dutch). As in English, but to a lesser degree, the inflectional grammar of the language (e.g., adjective and noun endings) has simplified over time.
Genders and cases.
The table of definite articles below demonstrates that contemporary Dutch is less complex than German. The article has just two forms, "de" and "het", more complex than English, which has only "the". The use of the older inflected form "den" in the dative or accusative as well as use of 'der' in the dative are restricted to numerous set phrases, surnames and toponyms.
In modern Dutch, the genitive articles 'des' and 'der' are only commonly used in idioms. Other usage is typically considered archaic or poetic. In most circumstances, the preposition 'van' is instead used, followed by the normal definitive article 'de' or 'het'. For the idiomatic use of the articles in the genitive, see for example:
In contemporary usage, the genitive case still occurs a little more often with plurals than with singulars, as the plural article is 'der' for all genders and no special noun inflection must be taken account of. 'Der' is commonly used in order to avoid reduplication of 'van', e.g. "het merendeel der gedichten van de auteur" instead of "het merendeel van de gedichten van de auteur" ("the bulk of the author's poems").
There are also genitive forms for the pronoun "die/dat" ("that those [ones"), namely "diens" for masculine and neuter singulars and "dier" for feminine singular and all plurals. Although usually avoided in common speech, these forms can be used instead of possessive pronouns to avoid confusion. Compare:
Analogically, the relative and interrogative pronoun "wie" ("who") has the genitive forms "wiens" and "wier" (corresponding to English "whose", but less frequent in use).
Dutch also has a range of fixed expressions that make use of the genitive articles, which can be abbreviated using apostrophes. Common examples include "'s ochtends" (with 's as abbreviation of des; "in the morning") and "desnoods" (lit: "of the need", translated: "if necessary").
The Dutch written grammar has simplified over the past 100 years: cases are now mainly used for the pronouns, such as "ik" (I), "mij, me" (me), "mijn" (my), "wie" (who), "wiens" (whose: masculine or neuter singular), "wier" (whose: feminine singular, masculine or feminine plural). Nouns and adjectives are not case inflected (except for the genitive of proper nouns (names): -s, -'s or -'). In the spoken language cases and case inflections had already gradually disappeared from a much earlier date on (probably the 15th century) as in many continental West Germanic dialects.
Inflection of adjectives is more complicated. The adjective receives no ending with indefinite neuter nouns in singular (as with "een" 'a/an'), and -e in all other cases. (This was also the case in Middle English, as in "a goode man".) Note that "fiets" belongs to the masculine/feminine category, and that "water" and "huis" are neuter. "Water" has no plural form.
An adjective has no e if it is in the predicative: "De soep is koud".
More complex inflection is still found in certain lexicalized expressions like "de heer des huizes" (literally, the man of the house), etc. These are usually remnants of cases (in this instance, the genitive case which is still used in German, cf. "Der Herr des Hauses") and other inflections no longer in general use today. In such lexicalized expressions remnants of strong and weak nouns can be found too, e.g. "in het jaar des Heren" (Anno Domini), where "-en" is actually the genitive ending of the weak noun. Also in this case, German retains this feature.
The developments of the Dutch and German case systems, however, are quite oppositional inasmuch as the genitive is the only case that is retained in modern Dutch—albeit to a limited degree—while the distinction between nominative, dative and accusative is lost completely (except in personal pronouns and fixed expressions). In German, on the contrary, the genitive is the only case that is widely avoided colloquially (and becoming less frequent in writing too) while the other three cases are distinguished throughout all registers of modern standard German.
Word order.
Dutch exhibits subject–object–verb word order, but in main clauses the conjugated verb is moved into the second position in what is known as verb second or V2 word order. This makes Dutch word order almost identical to that of German, but often different from English, which has subject–verb–object word order and has since lost the V2 word order that existed in Old English.
An example sentence used in some Dutch language courses and textbooks is ""Ik kan mijn pen niet vinden omdat het veel te donker is"", which translates into English word for word as ""I can my pen not find because it far too dark is"", but in standard English word order would be written ""I cannot find my pen because it is far too dark"". If the sentence is split into a main and subclause and the verbs highlighted, the logic behind the word order can be seen.
Main clause: ""Ik kan mijn pen niet vinden ""
Verbs are placed in the final position, but the conjugated verb, in this case "kan" (can), is made the second element of the clause.
Subclause: ""omdat het veel te donker is ""
The verb or verbs always go in the final position.
In an interrogative main clause the usual word order is: conjugated verb followed by subject; other verbs in final position:
""Kun jij je pen niet vinden?"" (literally ""Can you your pen not find?"") ""Can't you find your pen?""
In the Dutch equivalent of a wh-question the word order is: interrogative pronoun (or expression) + conjugated verb + subject; other verbs in final position:
""Waarom kun jij je pen niet vinden?"" (""Why can you your pen not find?"") ""Why can't you find your pen?"""
In a tag question the word order is the same as in a declarative clause:
""Jij kunt je pen niet vinden?"" (""You can your pen not find?"") ""You can't find your pen?"""
A subordinate clause does not change its word order: ""Kun jij je pen niet vinden omdat het veel te donker is?"" (""Can you your pen not find because it far too dark is?"") ""Can you not find your pen because it's too dark?"""
Diminutives.
Dutch nouns can take endings for size: -je for singular diminutive and -jes for plural diminutive. Between these suffixes and the radical can come extra letters depending on the ending of the word:
These diminutives are very common. As in German, all diminutives are neuter. In the case of words like "het meisje" (the girl), this is different from the natural gender. A diminutive ending can also be appended to an adverb or adjective (but not when followed by a noun).
Compounds.
Like most Germanic languages, Dutch forms noun compounds, where the first noun modifies the category given by the second ("hondenhok" = doghouse). Unlike English, where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in open form with separating spaces, Dutch (like the other Germanic languages) either uses the closed form without spaces ("boomhuis" = tree house) or inserts a hyphen ("VVD-coryfee" = outstanding member of the VVD, a political party). Like German, Dutch allows arbitrarily long compounds, but the longer they get, the less frequent they tend to be.
The longest serious entry in the Van Dale dictionary is (ceasefire negotiation). Leafing through the articles of association (Statuten) one may come across a 30-letter (authorisation of representation). An even longer word cropping up in official documents is "ziektekostenverzekeringsmaatschappij" (health insurance company) though the shorter "ziektekostenverzekeraar" (health insurer) is more common.
Notwithstanding official spelling rules, some Dutch people nowadays tend to write the parts of a compound separately, a practice sometimes dubbed "de Engelse ziekte" (the English disease).
Vocabulary.
Dutch vocabulary is predominantly Germanic in origin, considerably more so than English. This difference is mainly due to the heavy influence of Norman on English, and to Dutch patterns of word formation, such as the tendency to form long and sometimes very complicated compound nouns, being more similar to those of German and the Scandinavian languages. The Dutch vocabulary is one of the richest in the world and comprises at least 268,826 headwords. In addition, the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal (English: "Dictionary of the Dutch Language") is the largest dictionary in the world in print and has over 430,000 entries of Dutch words.
Like English, Dutch includes words of Greek and Latin origin. French has also contributed a large number of words, most of which have entered into Dutch vocabulary via the Netherlands and not via Belgium, in spite of the cultural and economic dominance exerted by French speakers in Belgium until the first half of the 20th century. This happened because the status French enjoyed as the language of refinement and high culture inspired the affluent upper and upper-middle classes in the Netherlands to adopt many French terms into the language.
In Belgium no such phenomenon occurred, since members of the upper and upper-middle classes would have spoken French rather than Frenchify their Dutch. French terms heavily influenced Dutch dialects in Flanders, but Belgian speakers did (and do) tend to resist French loanwords when using standard Dutch. Nonetheless some French loanwords of relatively recent date have become accepted in standard Dutch, also in Belgium, albeit with a shift in meaning and not as straight synonyms for existing Dutch words. For example, "blesseren" (from French "blesser", to injure) is almost exclusively used to refer to sports injuries, while in other contexts the standard Dutch verbs "kwetsen" and "verwonden" continue to be used.
Especially on the streets and in many professions, there is a steady increase of English loanwords, rather often pronounced or applied in a different way (see Dutch pseudo-anglicisms). The influx of English words is maintained by the dominance of English in the mass media and on the Internet.
The most important dictionary of the modern Dutch language is the Van Dale groot woordenboek der Nederlandse taal, more commonly referred to as the "Dikke van Dale" ("dik" means "thick"). However, it is dwarfed by the 45,000-page "Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal", a scholarly endeavour that took 147 years from initial idea to first edition.
Writing system.
Dutch is written using the Latin script. Dutch uses one additional character beyond the standard alphabet, the digraph IJ. It has a relatively high proportion of doubled letters, both vowels and consonants, due to the formation of compound words and also to the spelling devices for distinguishing the many vowel sounds in the Dutch language. An example of five consecutive doubled letters is the word "voorraaddoos" (supply box).
The diaeresis (Dutch: "trema") is used to mark vowels that are pronounced separately. In the most recent spelling reform, a hyphen has replaced the diaeresis in compound words (i.e., if the vowels originate from separate words, not from prefixes or suffixes), e.g. "zeeëend" (seaduck) is now spelled "zee-eend".
The acute accent occurs mainly in loanwords like "café", but can also be used for emphasis or to differentiate between two forms. Its most common use is to differentiate between the indefinite article 'een' (a, an) and the numeral 'één' (one); also 'hé' (hey, also written 'hee').
The grave accent is used to clarify pronunciation ('hè' what the ...?, tag question 'eh?', 'bèta') and in loanwords ('caissière' cashier, 'après-ski'). In the recent spelling reform, the accent grave was dropped as stress sign on short vowels in favour of the acute accent (e.g. 'wèl' was changed to 'wél').
Other diacritical marks such as the circumflex only occur in a few words, most of them loanwords from French.
The characters 'Ç', 'ç', 'Ñ' or 'ñ' can also be found in the Dutch language but the words which contain one of these characters are loanwords too and these words are inherited from Spain and Portugal. They don't occur very often.
The official spelling is set by the "Wet schrijfwijze Nederlandsche taal" (Law on the writing of the Dutch language; Belgium 1946, Netherlands 1947; based on a 1944 spelling revision; both amended in the 1990s after a 1995 spelling revision). The "Woordenlijst Nederlandse taal", more commonly known as "het groene boekje" (i.e. "the green booklet", because of its colour), is usually accepted as an informal explanation of the law. However, the official 2005 spelling revision, which reversed some of the 1995 changes and made new ones, has been welcomed with a distinct lack of enthusiasm in both the Netherlands and Belgium. As a result, the Genootschap Onze Taal (Our Language Society) decided to publish an alternative list, "het witte boekje" ("the white booklet"), which tries to simplify some complicated rules and offers several possible spellings for many contested words. This alternative orthography is followed by a number of major Dutch media organisations but mostly ignored in Belgium.
Dutch as a foreign language.
As a foreign language, Dutch is mainly taught in primary and secondary schools in areas adjacent to the Netherlands and Flanders. In French-speaking Belgium, over 300,000 pupils are enrolled in Dutch courses, followed by over 20,000 in the German states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia, and over 7,000 in the French region of Nord-Pas de Calais (of which 4,550 are in primary school). Dutch is the obligatory medium of instruction in schools in Suriname, even for non-native speakers. Dutch is taught in various educational centres in Indonesia, the most important of which is the Erasmus Language Centre (ETC) in Jakarta. Each year, some 1,500 to 2,000 students take Dutch courses there. In total, several thousand Indonesians study Dutch as a foreign language.
At an academic level, Dutch is taught in over 225 universities in more than 40 countries. About 10,000 students worldwide study Dutch at university. The largest number of faculties of "neerlandistiek" can be found in Germany (30 universities), followed by France and the United States (20 each). Five universities in the United Kingdom offer the study of Dutch. Owing to centuries of Dutch rule in Indonesia, many old documents are written in Dutch. Many universities therefore include Dutch as a source language, mainly for law and history students. In Indonesia this involves about 35,000 students. In South Africa, the number is difficult to estimate, since the academic study of Afrikaans inevitably includes the study of Dutch. Elsewhere in the world, the number of people learning Dutch is relatively small.
Popular misconceptions.
The language of Flanders.
Dutch is the language of government, education, and daily life in Flanders, the northern part of Belgium. There is no officially recognized language called "Flemish", and both the Dutch and Belgian governments adhere to the standard Dutch ("Algemeen Nederlands") defined by the Nederlandse Taalunie ("Dutch Language Union").
The actual differences between the spoken standard language of Dutch and Belgian speakers are comparable to the differences between American and British English or the German spoken in Germany and Austria. In other words, most differences are rather a matter of accent than of grammar. Some of these differences are recognized by the Taalunie and major dictionaries as being interchangeably valid, although some dictionaries and grammars may mark them as being more prevalent in one region or the other.
The use of the word "Vlaams" ("Flemish") to describe Standard Dutch for the variations prevalent in Flanders and used there, is common in the Netherlands and Belgium.
Dutch as a German dialect.
The question of what is a language, and what is a dialect, is rather a political and not a linguistic one. The dialect group from which Dutch is largely derived, Low Franconian, belongs to the whole of the continental West Germanic dialect set. This whole is sometimes imprecisely indicated by the word "German", but it might as well be called "Dutch". Indeed the Low Franconian dialects and languages are morphologically closer to the original form of Western Germanic than the High German from which standard German is derived. It is quite appropriate to call modern Dutch and High German sister languages, only they are derived not from one and the same common variety, but from cognate mother vernaculars of Continental West Germanic.
No intrinsic quality of the whole of the component dialects favours one standard over the other: both were rivals and historical contingency decided the range of their use. The state border does not reflect dialectal subdivisions. Only since the dialect continuum of continental West Germanic was broken by the 19th century introduction of mass education have the respective ranges been fixed; in the 18th century standard Dutch was still used as the normal written standard in the Lower Rhine, the county of Bentheim and East Frisia, now all part of Germany. See also Meuse-Rhenish.
Low Dietsch.
Low Dietsch (Dutch: Platdiets, Limburgish: Platduutsj, French: Thiois or Platdutch) is a term mainly used within the Flemish terminology for the transitional Limburgish-Ripuarian dialects of a number of towns and villages in the north-east of the Belgian province of Liege, such as Gemmenich, Homburg, Montzen and Welkenraedt.
Relation to English.
Dutch does have a relatively close genetic relationship to the descendants of Old and Middle English (such as English and Scots), since both belong to the West Germanic languages and both lack most or all of the High German consonant shift that characterizes the descendants of Middle High German (such as German and Yiddish).
The Frisian languages, however, are even more closely related to the Middle English descendants than Dutch. Languages and dialects sharing some features found in English and Frisian are referred to as Anglo-Frisian languages or, occasionally, "Ingvaeonic" languages.
Pennsylvania Dutch.
Pennsylvania Dutch, a West Central German variety called "Deitsch" by its speakers, is not a form of Dutch. The word "Dutch" has historically been used for all speakers of continental West Germanic languages, including, the Dutch people, Flemish, Austrians, Germans, and the German-speaking Swiss. It is cognate with the Dutch archaism "Diets", meaning "Dutch", and the German self-designation "Deutsch". The use of the term "Dutch" exclusively for the language of Belgium, or for the inhabitants of the Netherlands or some of its former colonies, dates from the early 16th century. The name "Dutch" for the Pennsylvania dialect also stems from the way "Deutsch" is pronounced in the dialect itself.
Pennsylvania Dutch must not be confused with Jersey Dutch as spoken in Upstate New York in former ages, and even until the 1950s in New Jersey, being Dutch-based creole or pidgin languages.
Dutch, not "Deutsch".
The resemblance of the English-language word "Dutch" (referring to the language spoken in the Netherlands and Flanders) and the German-language word "Deutsch" (meaning the language spoken in Germany, Austria, and much of Switzerland) is not accidental, since both derive from the Germanic word "þiudiskaz" ("of the people, popular, vulgar, vernacular"; that is, as opposed to Latin).
Until roughly the 16th century, speakers of all the varieties of West Germanic from the mouth of the Rhine to the Alps had been accustomed to refer to their native speech as the vernacular. This was "Dietsch" or "Duitsch" in Middle Dutch and what would eventually stabilize as "Deutsch" further south.
English-speakers took the word "Duitsch" from their nearest Germanic-speaking neighbours in the Low Countries, and having anglicized it as "Dutch", used it to refer to those neighbours and to the language they spoke. Meanwhile, however, especially after their secession from the Holy Roman Empire (i.e., Germany) in 1648, the Dutch began increasingly to refer to their own language as "Nederlandsch" (from which today's "Nederlands") in distinction from the people and speech of the Empire itself – "Duitsch" (now "Duits") – with the result that 'Dutch' and "Deutsch" now refer to two different languages. About that time (as in Jonathan Swift's "Gulliver's Travels"), the English called Dutch "Low Dutch" and German "High Dutch", but eventually "German" won out over "High Dutch" due to the German-speaking territories being known as "Germany", named after Germania.

Arya 2 () is a 2009 Telugu romance film directed by Sukumar, and is a follow-up to the actor's and the director's previous successful film, "Arya". Allu Arjun and Kajal Aggarwal play the lead roles while Navdeep and Shraddha Das play supporting roles
Sukumar, who directed the original, directed this film as well. The film's music is by Devi Sri Prasad. Aditya Babu and Bhogavalli Prasad produced the film under the Aditya Arts banner. The film was dubbed in Malayalam, Tamil and Oriya with the same title and became blockbuster in Kerala. Some scenes were recreated with Malayali-based scenes for this. Allu Arjun gained huge fan base in Kerala through this film.
This is the sequel to the 2004 Telugu film "Arya". The film was dubbed in Hindi as "Arya: Ek Deewana" and it fully used the shot-ready scenes from the Telugu movie. Arya 2 collected a Share of in 100 Days.Its Pre-release revenue's fetched an additional .
Plot.
The first scene of the film shows Arya (Allu Arjun) being carried into an operation theatre. His friend Ajay (Navdeep) narrates how Arya changed his life. In their childhood, Arya stays in an orphanage where has no friends or family. By force, he befriends Ajay who also is in that orphanage. One day, Ajay is adopted by a rich family and leaves the orphanage behind him. As time passes, he becomes a big shot business tycoon and has his own software company. but Arya becomes a drunkard and he can do anything for Ajay. Ajay feels ashamed to say that Arya is his friend and avoids him. But Arya convinces him that he would be a good boy if he' given a job in Ajay's company. Die hard friend Arya just wanted to stay close to Ajay. But Ajay has one condition that if Arya is proven as a "bad boy" in the office, he has to leave the company. Thus, Arya converts himself into a " Mr. Perfect" without any defect and joins in the company. Everyone in the company are fond of Arya especially Shanti (Shraddha Das) who is madly in love with him. One day Geetha (Kajal Aggarwal) joins the company and Ajay and Arya both immediately fall in love with her. Arya is now Geetha's Team Lead. In a lift one day, while Geetha converses with Arya, suddenly he kisses her. In many other instances also, Arya keeps confessing his love to Geetha without anyone knowing about it. Ajay now wants to get rid of Arya. So, he crashes his own (Ajay's) car and weaves a story that Arya has crashed him. He did so, so that everyone would accuse Arya and he would be fired. At this juncture, Geetha comes to know that Ajay too loves her.
The next day at the office, Arya shows his true colours and arranges Ajay and Geetha's wedding. But on the day of their wedding, Geetha is taken away by her family to her hometown. Arya decides to bring her back at any cost. He is introduced to her family and he stays at her house amid the preparations for the wedding. Due to some reasons, caused by Arya the wedding is stopped and Arya is asked to marry Geetha. After their marriage, Ajay arrives to their town and the trio decide to go away from the place before they could find out that Geetha does not love Arya. The three of them stay at a hotel and decide that they must forget all of their worries for Geetha and Ajay would be gone and Arya left alone. But, Geetha's father finds them and while attempting to stab Ajay, Arya rescues him. But he is stabbed instead. Arya is rushed to hospital where it is seen that Geetha is truly in love with Arya. At the end, Arya asks Ajay to press a button. Unknowingly, Ajay does so. Suddenly, Arya starts suffocating for the supply of Oxygen is stopped. Geetha slaps Ajay for doing so and Arya says sorry to Ajay when she goes and holds his hand and Ajay just smiles and walks out.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack and background score were composed by Devi Sri Prasad. The music was released on 1 November 2009 at Rock Heights, Madhapur, Hyderabad. The audio rights of the soundtrack were purchased by Sony Music. The tracks "Ringa Ringa", "Uppenantha Prema" and "My Love Is Gone" topped the music charts. The song "Ringa Ringa" created a cult status. This song was played in Cricket stadiums during the breaks of Indian Premier League and 2011 Cricket World Cup held in Bangalore. Also, the music of the song was re-used by Devi Sri Prasad in the Salman Khan movie, Ready as "Dhinka Chika".
Reception.
Critical reception.
Arya 2 received mixed reviews from critics, "Rediff.com" gave a review stating "Arya 2 is no patch on Arya which was a huge success. Sukumar seems to have tried a so-called different story line which is perplexing. It's only the first half of the film which makes for interesting viewing, otherwise the film is the usual routine stuff interspersed with some good dances and slick technical work" and rated the film 2.5/5 terming the film a "Disappointing" one. "Sify.com" gave a review stating "Arya 2 is not really a sequel to that trendsetter, Arya. Neither is the movie entertaining like the original nor does it have any interesting moments. In fact, it is big disappointment. Illogical plot line, silly scenes and confusing second half makes the film a tedious watch" and termed the film an "Average" one. "greatandhra.com" gave a review stating "It’s the movie released with many expectations but finally ended up as a disappointment. The masses in theatres yelled like hell when the show has begun but slowly turned pale and passive as the movie is rolling on. The first day morning show has given a signal that it’s going to be thumbs down in B,C centers. But A centers may find some oxygen. On a whole it’s a disappointment" and rated the film 2.5/5 alleging that the film gave "Wrong Signals". "Cinegoer.net" gave a review stating "Aarya 2 is a disappointing movie, characters having their own strange goals, analysis and approach. The film irritates you, it promises a very interesting beginning but as it moves ahead you are treated to a routine ending. In fact you could run the risk of seeing a psychologist like Brahmanandam if you'd take the movie seriously or even lightly." "chitramala.com" gave a review stating "Arya-2 with its not so impressive story and screenplay comes as a huge disappointment. The film is supposed to be about love, friendship and more importantly sacrifice but it is not really so. The ending may be in tune with the characterization of the hero but it does not really impress the audience. Arya-2 is unlikely to set the box office on fire" and rated the film 2.5/5.
However, the film received positive reviews too. "idlebrain.com" gave a review stating "The plus points of the movie are creative scenes, Allu Arjun, songs (dances) and technical values. On the flip side, psychotic orientation and confusion in hero’s characterization doesn't get audiences involved in the movie intently. On a whole, Arya 2 is a different film that can appeal to A centers and class crowds" and rated the film 3/5 terming it "story of a psychotic orphan". "Oneindia Entertainment" gave a review stating "For those who go to watch Allu Arjun film with some expectations, the film would be a true feast. What all one could expect from Allu Arjun"s film could be available in this movie. With the excellent dances and melodious audio, the film would surely be a big hit. The film had all kinds of masala that is needed for a commercial formula film and it would definitely ring the box office and would remain another milestone in Allu Arjun"s career." "IndiaGlitz" gave a review stating "Arya-2, though not in any way a second edition of that mature predecessor, is nevertheless both interesting and sympathetic. It's greatest asset is the riveting second half. It's biggest drawback is the slowness Arjun's character takes to grow on us. If it's intelligence and humour in the second half make it enjoyable, the drabness, tacky comedy and excruciating scenes make it unwatchable in the first half. Thankfully, everything is undone by the second 80 minutes, which you will want to watch again and again" and called it an "Entertaining, on again, off again" film. "123telugu.com" gave a review stating "The film redefines the word 'Style'! Allu Arjun is back with a totally new look and style. The entire story is woven around Arya's character. The film has its share of brilliance, especially the scenes between Brahmanandam and his team, conversations between Allu Arjun and Navdeep and the entire episode involving Ajay. Arya-2 is the kind of film which you will either dazzle you or bore you to death, there's no middle way. Either way we end up hallucinating under its influence!" and rated the film 3/5 terming that it "Redefines Style". "fullhyderabad.com" gave a review stating "As for visuals, Arya 2 is undoubtedly a slickly made production. The overall design is as colourful and as cheerful as the promos have led you to believe, with the title song being one of the smartest portions of the film. For an audience starved of merry-making at the movies, this one could quite be the party whose invitation won't be chucked away so soon" and rated the film 6.5/10.

Sweetwater Brewery

The Sweetwater Brewery, also known as the Green River Brewery, was built in 1900 in Green River, Wyoming. The present structure is the surviving remnant of a three-building complex comprising an office/saloon, engine house, and the present brewery building. It was the first brewery in Wyoming, with operations dating to 1872 when Adam Braun began the business, the first of a series of ethnic German brewers. The brewery was further developed by Otto Rauch and Karl Spinner. The present structure was built by the fourth proprietor, Hugo Gaensslen, a Chicagoan who decorated the building with turrets reminiscent of the Chicago Water Tower.
The two story building is composed of rock-faced ashlar sandstone, mostly quarried away. The fanciful turrets feature mock-medieval features such as merlons and crenels. The largest tower is on the southwest corner and features a flagpole topped by a large ball.
Gaensslen concentrated on brewing, leasing the adjacent saloon to an operator. With the passage of the Volstead Act, brewing stopped and the company's name changed to the Sweetwater Beverage Company, making a non-alcoholic drink named "Green River" and a near-beer called "Wyoming Beverage." The business did not prosper and failed with the death of Gaensslen in 1931, two years before the end of Prohibition.
IN 1936 the closed business was bought by a con man named Tom Flaherty, who made some poor beer and skipped town to Canada. Since that time, no beer has been made in the building, which has housed various commercial businesses.

Red auxiliary number

In the study of ancient Egyptian mathematics, red auxiliary numbers were additive numbers that summed to a numerator used in Middle Kingdom arithmetic problems. In the 1650 BCE Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (RMP), the additive set of divisors were written in red ink. Red auxiliary numbers were used for several purposes The red auxiliary numbers were divisors of a greatest common divisor (GCD) that was used to generally convert 2/n to optimized, but not optimal, unit fraction series. The main purpose created 2/n tables by hi-lighting scribal skills in converting rational numbers to optimized, but not optimal, unit fraction series. The RMP 2/n table reported Egyptian fraction series by multiplying 2/n by a LCM m, written as a unity (m/m), that obtained 2m/mn. Ahmes the RMP author, practiced the selection of red auxiliary numbers in RMP 21, 22, and 23 and detailed other aspects of the red number method in RMP 36. The scaled 2m/mn rational number was converted to a unit fraction series by finding the best set of divisors of (GCD) mn, as discussed below. 
For example, Ahmes converted 2/43 by LCM 42, thinking:
To parse 84/1806 Ahmes selected the best divisors of 1806 from {43, 42, 21, 14, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1}, denoting the divisors that best summed to numerator 84 in .
Ahmes chose rather than , or , 
such that:
The 2/"n" table method that was validated in RMP 36 with an explicit conversion of 3/53 scaled to 60/1060. The best divisors of 1060 were summed to 60 within /1060 and 1/20 + 1/265 + 1/530 + 1/1060. The red number method was used over six times in RMP 36 and over seven times in RMP 37. 
Scribal red numbers, LCMs and GCDs were known for over 130 years before being rigorously parsed. Math historians failed to parse aspects of red numbers seen in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the (RMP 2/n table) in the manner recorded by Ahmes. Math historians recognized red numbers were connected to LCMs, but few explicit details were described in the 2/n table. In the 21st century math historians began to parse Middle Kingdom origins and applications of red numbers. Ahmes practiced finding LCMs and its red divisor factored aspect of GCDs in RMP 21, 22 and 23, a topic introduced by George G. Joseph, "Crest of the Peacock" in 1991: 
On page 37, example 3.7 Joseph reports:
Complete 2/3 + 1/4 + 1/28 to 1.
This meant: solve 2/3 + 1/4 + 1/28 + x = 1 (example 3.7)
The lowest common denominator (LCM) is not 28, but rather 42. Modern students would likely multiple 3 times 28 finding an LCM of 84. But 42 was sufficient for Ahmes, and Egyptian scribes, as noted by: 
was written out in fractions
with 42 marked in red, and not our modern algebra form that would have written 42x.
The unknown fraction x is found by solving
meant that
Additional RMP problems asked Ahmes to complete a series of fractions that added up to a given number include:
using Least common multiple (LCM) 30 to find 
such that:
was rewritten as:
and,
using LCM 45 to compute "x" = 1/9 + 1/40
It is important to note that the Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll (EMLR) and the RMP 2/n table employed LCMs within modern-like multiplication and division operations. Decoding Red numbers arithmetic and its applications have surprisingly decoded modern-like arithmetic operations that were hidden in scribal shorthand notes. 
In RMP 37 LCM 72 scaled 1/4 to 72/288 and 1/8 to 72/576. Red numbers parsed 72/88 by /288 and 72/576 by /576, both non-optimal unit fraction series. Ahmes aligned each red number below a unit fraction showing that red denoted an inverse relationship to a unit fraction, even to numerators that were not integers.
The optimized Egyptian fraction series was an implicit topic of the RMP 2/n table. The RMP began with 1/3 of the text reporting 51 2/n optimized, but not always optimal, Egyptian fraction series by implicitly selecting optimized, but not optimal, red auxiliary numbers from the divisors, aliquot parts, of scaled denominators mn.
Red numbers defined a core method that math historians pondered for over 130 years finally parsing the method in the 21st century. Aspects of the method were exposed in a 2002 AD EMLR paper, 2006 with an Akhmim Wooden Tablet paper, and an Ebers Papyrus paper. Non-additive numerical methods connected Egyptian weights and measures, 2/n tables, and other ancient scribal methods to red numbers, with RMP 36 and RMP 37 providing the final abstract aspects of the method.
In summary, after 2002 alternative views of Middle Kingdom red numbers exposed LCMs and GCDs in updated translations of the scribal raw data. Several scribal notes of RMP problems included modern-like multiplication and division operations. Recent journal papers report Ahmes' use of red numbers, one being origin issues related to the factoring of rational numbers into its unique prime factors. Scribal division operations and applications employed modern-like quotients and remainders in a arithmetic system. Ahmes divided 2 by n 51 times to create a 2/n table. Ahmes also divided a hekat unity (64/64) and 320 ro, by n in two different volume based weights and measures systems. The traditional Old Kingdom duplation multiplication operationally proved the arithmetic accuracy of unit fraction answers, and was not the primary Middle Kingtdom multiplication operation.

UCL Ear Institute

The UCL Ear Institute is an academic department of the Faculty of Brain Sciences of University College London (UCL) located in London, United Kingdom. The Institute is based next to the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital, the UK's largest ear, nose and throat hospital, on Gray's Inn Road in the Bloomsbury district of Central London.
Together with the Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital, the Institute constitutes the largest centre for audiological research in Europe.
History.
In 2000 an £11 million grant from the Wellcome Trust was awarded to UCL to fund the creation of a new Centre for Auditory Research bringing together auditory research scientists and clinicians from across the university. The new centre was linked to the long standing Institute of Laryngology and Otology (ILO) and its incorporated School of Audiology. In order to provide this cross-faculty, multidisciplinary group with a unifying identity the ILO was disestablished and the UCL Ear Institute created on 1 January 2005. Prof Tony Wright was its first director, followed by Prof David McAlpine from June 2006. 
In December 2006 the results of tests carried out at the Institute were published which showed that many children's toys available that Christmas could damage a child's hearing. In February 2007 the Widex Noise Report, a major survey of noise levels in 41 English towns and cities authored by Deepak Prasher of the UCL Ear Institute, was published. In July 2008 the UCL Ear Institute participated in an architectural jelly competition, with the sound of the competing structures being recorded in one of the Institute's anechoic chambers.
In March 2010 a team including Professor Martin Birchall of the UCL Ear Institute performed the first windpipe transplant using a whole tissue engineered windpipe organ crafted from a patient's own stem cells. In the same month a team from the Institute began a major study to investigate the role of the brain in the auditory process. In August 2010 Aura Satz, the UCL Ear Institute's artist-in-residence, exhibited the results of her work at the Institute in 'Location, location, location' at the Jerwood Space gallery in London. In January 2011 a team including Professor Martin Birchall of the UCL Ear Institute performed the world's second voice box transplant. In June 2011 it was reported that Professor Martin Birchall had been granted permission by the Royal College of Surgeons to carry out the first voicebox transplant trials in the UK.
Education.
At undergraduate level the Institute currently offers the BSc in Audiology, a four-year degree course leading to qualification to practise as an audiologist in the NHS and elsewhere. The degree extends across the field to include acoustics; the understanding of normal hearing and balance function, the clinical diagnosis and rehabilitation of their disorders, speech perception and language development; paediatric clinical assessments; cochlear implants; tinnitus; and hearing therapy.
At postgraduate level the Institute currently offers the following courses:
Three- and four-year PhD programmes are available in a wide range of basic and clinical disciplines, including genetics, cell and molecular biology, auditory neuroscience and human auditory function.
Library.
The UCL Ear Institute and RNID Libraries are a collaborative venture between UCL, The Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) and the NHS. The libraries are based at the Royal National Throat Nose & Ear Hospital and together constitute the largest specialist collection for audiology, deaf studies, and otorhinolaryngologic medicine in Europe. As well as providing services to staff and students at UCL, RNID, and the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust, the libraries are open to the public and provide reference and enquiry services to anyone conducting relevant research.

Udyoga Parva

The Udyoga Parva (), or "the Book of Effort," is the fifth of eighteen books of the Indian Epic Mahabharata. Udyoga Parva has 10 sub-books and 198 chapters.
Udyoga Parva describes the period immediately after the exile of Pandavas had ended. The Pandavas return, demand their half of the kingdom. The Kauravas refuse. The book includes the effort for peace that fails, followed by the effort to prepare for the great war - the Kurukshetra War.
"Viduraniti", a theory of leadership, is embedded in Udyoga Parva (Chapters 33-40). The "Sanatsujatiya", a text commented upon by Adi Shankara, is contained within the Udyoga Parva (Chapters 41-46).
Structure and chapters.
This "Parva" (book) has 10 sub-parvas (sub-books or little books) and 198 adhyayas (sections, chapters). The following are the sub-parvas:
English translations.
Udyoga Parva was composed in Sanskrit. Several translations of the book in English are available. Two translations from 19th century, now in public domain, are those by Kisari Mohan Ganguli and Manmatha Nath Dutt. The translations vary with each translator's interpretations.
Clay Sanskrit Library has published a 15 volume set of the Mahabharata which includes a translation of Udyoga Parva by Kathleen Garbutt. This translation is modern and uses an old manuscript of the Epic. The translation does not remove verses and chapters now widely believed to be spurious and smuggled into the Epic in 1st or 2nd millennium AD.
According to the "Parvasangraha" chapter of Adi Parva of one version of the Mahabharata, Vyasa had composed 186 sections in Udyoga Parva, with 6,698 slokas.
J. A. B. van Buitenen completed an annotated edition of Udyoga Parva, based on critically edited and least corrupted version of Mahabharata known in 1975. Debroy, in 2011, notes that updated critical edition of Udyoga Parva, with spurious and corrupted text removed, has 10 sub-books, 197 adhyayas (chapters) and 6,001 shlokas (verses). Debroy's translation of a critical edition of Udyoga Parva has been published in Volume 4 of his series.
Salient features.
Udyoga Parva has several embedded treatises, such as a theory of leadership (Viduraniti), a theory of dūta (diplomats, envoys) and a theory of just war.
Viduraniti.
In Chapters 33 through 40 of Udyoga Parva, also called Prajagara sub-parva, sage Vidura outlines things wise people and leaders should do, and things they should not. These are known as "Viduraniti". Some examples of his recommendations for leaders:
Viduraniti also includes few hundred verses with suggestions for personal development and characteristics of a wise person. For example, in Chapter 33, Vidura suggests a wise person refrains from anger, exultation, pride, shame, stupefaction and vanity. He has reverence and faith, he is unhampered in his endeavors by either adversity or prosperity. He believes virtue and profit can go together, exerts and acts to the best of his ability, disregards nothing. He understands quickly, listens carefully, acts with purpose. He does not grieve for what is lost, and does not lose his sense during crisis. He is constantly learning, he seeks enlightenment from everything he experiences. He acts after deciding, and decides after thinking. He neither behaves with arrogance, nor with excessive humility. He never speaks ill of others, nor praises himself. He does not exult in honours to himself, nor grieves at insults; he is not agitated by what others do to him just like a calm lake near river Ganges.
Theory of envoys.
J. A. B. van Buitenen, and others, have referred to parts of Udyoga Parva, along with Book 12 of Mahabharata and non-Epic works such as Arthasastra, as a treatise on diplomats and envoys (called "dūta", Sanskrit: दूत) involved in negotiations between parties. Broadly, the Parva recognizes four types of envoys - "Samdisțārtha" are envoys who convey a message but do not have any discretion to negotiate; "Parimițārtha" are envoys who are granted a circumscribed purpose with some flexibility on wording; "Nisrșțārtha" are envoys with an overall goal and significant discretion to adapt the details of negotiations to the circumstances; finally, "Dūtapranidhi", a full ambassador who has full confidence of the party he represents, understands the interests and Dharma (law, morals, duties) of both parties, and can decide the goal as well as style of negotiations (Krishna acts as such an ambassador in Bhagavat-yana sub-parva of Udyoga Parva).
Udyoga Parva outlines the four methods of negotiations recommended for envoys who are "dūtapranidhi": conciliation for the cause of peace and Dharma ("sāman"), praise your side while dividing the opposition by describing consequences of success and consequences of failure to reach a deal ("bheda"), bargain with gifts and concessions ("dāna"), bargain with threats of punishment ("daņda"). Beyond describing the types of diplomats, Udyoga Parva also lists how the envoy and messengers for negotiations should be selected, the safety and rights of envoys that must be respected by the receiving party regardless of how unpleasant or pleasant the message is. Envoys must be honest, truthful and direct without fear, that they serve not only the cause of king who sends them, but the cause of dharma (law), peace and truth.

Frederick Grinke

Frederick Grinke (born 8 August 1911 Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada - died 16 March 1987 Ipswich, UK) was a Canadian-born violinist who had an international career as soloist, chamber musician and teacher. He was known especially for his performances of 20th-century English music.
Training.
Frederick Grinke started learning to play violin at the age of 9, and studied with John Waterhouse and others in Winnipeg. He made his first broadcast at the age of about 12 and formed a trio at age 15. In 1927 he won a Dominion of Canada scholarship award to the Royal Academy of Music in London, where he studied with Rowsby Woof. He continued his studies (at age 21) for a summer with Adolf Busch in Switzerland, and afterwards in Belgium and London with Carl Flesch.
Career.
Hamilton Harty considered appointing him leader of the London Symphony Orchestra at age 21, but finally the offer was not made on account of his youth. From around 1930 to 1936 Grinke was second violin of the Kutcher String Quartet (in which John Barbirolli was for a time the 'cellist). In 1935, with pianist Dorothy Manley, he gave the premiere of the Canadian composer Hector Gratton's "Quatrieme danse canadienne". It was with Manley and Florence Hooton, both fellow-students at the Academy, that Grinke formed his trio, Kendall Taylor later replacing Manley.
Boyd Neel Orchestra.
In 1937 he became concertmaster of the Boyd Neel Orchestra. His first performance with them was at Salzburg Festival in 1937, giving the premiere of "Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge" by Benjamin Britten. He began teaching as Professor at the Royal Academy in 1939, and included among his pupils were many who went on to become leading British artists (including Sydney Humphreys (of the Aeolian Quartet), Clarence Myerscough and Rosemary Rapaport). 
In 1940 he volunteered for the Royal Air Force, joining its Royal Air Force Symphony Orchestra, and toured with them worldwide, notably in the United States. On one occasion he was flown back to England especially for a performance of the Arnold Bax concerto (with which he was particularly associated) at the Royal Albert Hall. He also performed before Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin and Harry S. Truman at the Potsdam Three-Power Conference. In 1945 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music.
Post-war: concerts and recordings.
He remained concertmaster for the Boyd Neel Orchestra until 1947, performing in Europe, USA, Australia and New Zealand (in 1947), and at the London Proms, Salzburg and the Edinburgh Festival. He resigned from it to pursue his solo career.
During the later 1940s Grinke made numerous recordings, mainly for Decca, many of which were originally released in the last years of 78rpm records. His recordings of John Ireland's chamber music include the Phantasie Trio of 1908, the 1938 Trio no 3 in E major, and "The Holy Boy" (with Florence Hooton (cello) and Kendall Taylor (piano)), and the Violin Sonata no 1 of 1909 with the composer at the piano. The trio also recorded the Phantasy trio of Frank Bridge and the Beethoven trio in E flat.
Ralph Vaughan Williams dedicated his Sonata in A minor, written in 1952, to Grinke, who recorded the composer's "Concerto Accademico" in D minor, and "The Lark Ascending", with the Boyd Neel Orchestra. Grinke and David Martin (also a Canadian violinist) performed J.S. Bach's Concerto for two violins at Vaughan Williams's funeral. He made a broadcast of the Arnold Bax concerto from Australia.
Among other recordings from the 1940s were nos 3 and 9 from the 1697 set of 10 Sonatas by Henry Purcell, with Jean Pougnet and Boris Ord, and that composer's sonata in G minor with Arnold Goldsbrough. He is heard with Kendall Taylor in the Dvořák G major Sonatina op 100, and with Watson Forbes (violist of the Stratton Quartet and Aeolian Quartet) in Mozart duos. He also premiered and recorded works by Arthur Benjamin, Benjamin Dale, Lennox Berkeley, Kenneth Leighton, Edmund Rubbra, York Bowen, Howard Ferguson, Arthur Bliss, Béla Bartók, Beethoven, Handel, Rachmaninoff and Smetana, often accompanied by Ivor Newton. He recorded a complete Brandenburg Concertos with the Boyd Neel.
Later teaching.
Despite his work in Britain Grinke maintained connections with Canada through the 1960s. From 1963-1966 he taught at the Yehudi Menuhin School at Stoke D'Abernon, Surrey. He frequently sat on juries for international competitions. He retired from the Royal Academy of Music in 1978, and was awarded the CBE in 1979, but continued teaching until his death, which occurred in 1987. The National Portrait Gallery lists 8 portraits of Grinke in its collections.
Grinke played an instrument by J. B. Rogerius of 1686, with aluminium-covered D and A, and silver-covered G and steel E strings, but also often played a Stradivarius dated 1718, lent by the Royal Academy of Music. He was married in 1942 to Dorothy Sirr Sheldon and had one son.

Bhisma Parva

The Bhisma Parva (), or "the Book of Bhisma," is the sixth of eighteen books of the Indian Epic Mahabharata. Bhisma Parva has 4 sub-books and 124 chapters.
Bhisma Parva describes the first 10 days of the 18 day Kurukshetra War, and its consequences. It recites the story of Bhisma, the commander in chief of the Kaurava armies, who is fatally injured and can no longer lead as the commander.
This book of Mahabharata includes the widely studied Bhagavad gita, sometimes referred to as "Gita", or "The Song of the Lord", or "The Celestial Song." Bhagavadgita chapters describe Arjuna's questioning the purpose of war, ultimate effects of violence and the meaning of life. Arjuna's doubts and metaphysical questions are answered by Krishna. Other treatises in Bhisma parva include the just war theory in ancient India, as well as strategies of war and troop deployment.
Structure and chapters.
This "Parva" (book) has 4 sub-parvas (sub-books or little books) and 124 adhyayas (sections, chapters). The following are the sub-parvas:

Just war theory.
The Jamvukhanda Vinirmana sub-parva of Bhisma parva is one of the several instances in the Mahabharata that provides an outline of just war theory in ancient India. Book 12 ("Shanti Parva") is another instance of a significant discussion of just war theory and principles of proportionate punishment.
Before the first day of war, the Kurus, the Pandavas and the Somakas meet and agree on rules of war. Some examples of the agreed rules were:

Lola (TV series)

Lola (Greek: Λόλα) was the Greek remake of the successful Argentine comedy franchise Lalola. The series premiered on September 22, 2008 in Greece on ANT1 and ran Monday through Friday. The last episode was released on July 7, 2009.
Plot.
The TV series centers on the transformation of a man into a woman, sharing with the audience the comical daily events of "her" new life.
The story begins with Leonidas Lalos who is editor and director of "Mister", a typical men's lifestyle magazine. Young, successful and accomplished, he is an eligible bachelor who has the same attitude towards women as he portrays them in his magazine: expendable pleasure items. His philosophy on life can be summed up as follows: fast cars, fast internet, fast women! In his path he leaves many brokenhearted victims the last of which, the beautiful and mysterious Romina decides to teach him a lesson. With the help of a gypsy she casts a spell on him. On a night with a moon eclipse, the transformation takes places and Lalos wakes up the next day as a beautiful woman.
Feeling lost and trapped in a body filled with unknown hormones, Lola asks Hara, her best friend for help. Hara was secretly in love with Lalos for years. They look for Romina but can't find her. Lola is thus forced to adjust to her new identity and to address the world as a woman with Hara's help. So as to retain her authority in the magazine, Lola appears as Lalo's first cousin to replace him for as long as he is abroad. 
Lola is faced with the hard reality of being a woman in the 21st century. Although women have accomplished a lot, the structures of society still remain phallocratic. She thus learns first hand all about sexual harassment and sexist work behaviour. At the same time she discovers the insanity experienced by a modern woman who has to be the professional, sexy, responsible, fashionable, and as well as a homemaker.
On the one hand Lola wants to get rid of her new self, on the other hand she feels ever more like a woman. However, in all this mess Lola has an advantage: she knows first hand male psychology coupled with female intuition. Things get more complicated when she falls in love with her colleague Fotis, who falls in love with her at first sight. Thus Lola discovers the emotional tantrums of the female nature.

Memorials to William Shakespeare

William Shakespeare has been commemorated in a number of different statues and memorials around the world, notably his funerary monument in Stratford-upon-Avon (c.1623); a statue in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey, London, designed by William Kent and executed by Peter Scheemakers (1740); and a statue in New York's Central Park by John Quincy Adams Ward (1872).
17th century.
Shakespeare's funerary monument is the earliest memorial to the playwright, located inside Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, UK, the same church in which he was baptised. The exact date of its construction is not known, but must have been between Shakespeare's death in 1616 and 1623, when it is mentioned in the First Folio of the playwright's works.
The monument, by Gerard Johnson, is mounted on a wall above Shakespeare's grave. It features a bust of the poet, who holds a quill pen in one hand and a piece of paper in another. His arms are resting on a cushion. Above him is the Shakespeare family's coat of arms, on either side of which stands two allegorical figures: one, representing Labour, holds a spade, the other, representing Rest, holds a torch and a skull.
18th century.
In 1757 the English actor David Garrick commissioned a marble statue of William Shakespeare from the French sculptor Louis-François Roubiliac for his Palladian Temple to Shakespeare at Hampton. Garrick himself is thought to have posed for the statue. It was bequeathed, along with Garrick's books, to the British Museum in 1779; in 2005 it was transferred to the British Library. Garrick later commissioned Roubiliac to produce a bust of the poet for his Shakespeare festival in Stratford in 1769; this is now in the Garrick Club in London.
In 1788, in the exterior wall of John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery building, the architect George Dance the Younger placed Thomas Banks's sculpture "Shakespeare attended by Painting and Poetry", for which the artist was paid 500 guineas. The sculpture depicted Shakespeare, reclining against a rock, between the Dramatic Muse and the Genius of Painting. Beneath it was a panelled pedestal inscribed with a quotation from "Hamlet": "He was a Man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again". The building was later used by the British Institution. After its demolition the monument was relocated to the garden of New Place in Stratford.
19th century.
By the nineteenth century Shakespeare's reputation had advanced to the point of what came to be known as bardolatry. Statues and other memorials began to appear outside Britain, while in Britain itself Shakespeare's status as national poet was consolidated.
USA.
New York City's Central Park contains a statue of Shakespeare that was commissioned in 1864 as a celebration of the tricentenary of Shakespeare's birth in 1564. Funds were raised by a performance of "Julius Caesar" in which Edwin Booth took the lead role, with John Wilkes Booth playing Mark Antony. The statue was designed by John Quincy Adams Ward. Following the creation of the statue, in 1873 commissioners proposed that the Mall should be a designated location for sculpture and the statue was moved there, soon to be accompanied by others (in 1986, a replica of the statue was made for the State Theater in Montgomery, Alabama, which has a yearly Shakespeare Festival). 
In 1888, a large seated statue by William Ordway Partridge was unveiled in Lincoln Park, Chicago and in 1896 a bronze statue of Shakespeare by Frederick William MacMonnies was erected as part of a series representing the world's geniuses in the gallery of the reading-room of the Library of Congress.
Britain.
With the removal of Banks's sculpture to New Place in 1871 London boasted no outdoor public memorial to the bard, and the erection of the New York statue in 1872 made this omission particularly glaring. In 1874 the financier Baron Albert Grant, wishing to address this situation, installed a fountain with a marble statue of Shakespeare at its centre in the gardens of Leicester Square. Sculpted by Giovanni Fontana, this was a replica of Scheemakers's monument in Poets' Corner. Another statue was erected in Stratford, London, a suburb with the same name as Shakespeare's home town.
In 1877 a committee was created in Stratford-upon-Avon to erect a memorial to Shakespeare. This originally comprised a theatre building, to be sited on land donated by the bank of the Avon within sight of the church where Shakespeare was buried. A statue was also created in 1888, the work of Lord Ronald Gower. This is situated in Stratford's Bancroft Gardens. The monument shows Shakespeare seated on a pedestal, surrounded, at ground level, by statues of Hamlet, Lady Macbeth, Prince Hal, and Falstaff. These characters were intended to be emblematic of Shakespeare's creative versatility: representing Philosophy, Tragedy, History, and Comedy. Another statue is present in a niche on the exterior of the town hall building.
Other countries.
Though most memorials are to be found in English speaking countries, there are also monuments elsewhere. In 1888 a statue was erected on the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, designed by Paul Fournier.
20th century.
Britain.
Between 1970 and 1993, an image of the Poets' Corner statue of Shakespeare appeared on the reverse of Series D £20 notes issued by the Bank of England. Alongside the statue was an engraving of the balcony scene from "Romeo and Juliet".
A complex memorial to Shakespeare was created in Southwark Cathedral, which was his parish church when he lived in London close to the Globe Theatre. It is also the burial place of Shakespeare's brother Edmund, along with other Elizabethan actors and playwrights. A recumbent statue of Shakespeare, created by Henry McCarthy in 1912, was placed in a niche on which was carved images of Elizabethan Southwark depicting the Globe, Winchester Palace and the tower of the church. An elaborate stained glass window was also created, depicting Shakespearean characters. The original window was destroyed by a bomb blast in World War II but was replaced in 1954. A birthday celebration of Shakespeare is held every year in April.
Continental Europe.
Despite Germany's early role in canonising Shakespeare it was not until 1904 that a statue was erected in Weimar showing him, as one critic has put it, "seated and staring into the distance with a bemused and thoughtful look". It was designed by Otto Lessing. 
In Denmark, a memorial statue was commissioned to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the publication of "Hamlet" in 1603. The statue, designed by Louis Hasselriis, was funded by public subscription and erected in Elsinore, along with a sculpture of Hamlet.
Australia.
A memorial in Sydney, Australia was built in 1926 by Sir Bertram MacKennal. It was commissioned by Henry Gullett (d. 4 August 1914), a former president of the Shakespeare Society of New South Wales. It depicts not only Shakespeare but five of his most famous characters - Hamlet, Romeo, Juliet, Portia and Falstaff. It is located in Shakespeare Place, between the Mitchell Library (part of the State Library of New South Wales) and the Royal Botanic Gardens. In 1959 the statue was repositioned to make way for the Cahill Expressway.
Though initiated in 1889, the project to create a Shakespeare statue in Ballarat was not completed until 1960. Financial problems led to repeated shelving of the project. Eventually private donations to the fund produced sufficient resources to commission a bronze sculpture from Andor Meszaros, an Australian artist originally from Hungary. The statue depicts Shakespeare bowing, as if at the end of a performance.
North America.
A statue was created for Logan Circle, Philadelphia in 1926, designed by Alexander Stirling Calder. It does not depict Shakespeare himself, but rather the figures of Touchstone the jester from "As You Like It", representing comedy, and Hamlet, representing tragedy. Touchstone is lounging with his head tilted laughing, his feet hanging over the top of the tall stone pedestal and his left arm resting on Hamlet's legs. Hamlet is seated, brooding, his knife dangling over Touchstone's body. The opening lines of the famous All the world's a stage speech from "As You Like It" are inscribed on the pedestal beneath the figures.
A statue made from tin was erected in the gardens outside the Festival Theatre, the principal theatre on the grounds of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, held every year from April to November in Stratford, Ontario, Canada.

John de Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Chartley

John de Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Chartley (1271, Cardiff – c. 1324, Gascony) was the son of Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby and Alianore de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun and Eleanor de Braose, and granddaughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford.
Sometime before 1300, Sir John married Hawise de Muscegros. Hawise was born on 21 December 1276, a daughter of Robert de Muscegros. She died about June 1340. The couple had one son Robert who was born in 1309 in Staffordshire and became Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Baron Ferrers of Chartley upon his father's death.
In 1264 John, without any true inheritance other than the turbulent spirit of his father, joined the Earl of Hertford and other rebellious Barons in opposing the collection of subsidies granted by the parliament then held at St Edmundsbury, to the crown.
The ferment was allayed by the King's confirming Magna Carta, and their charter of the forests; and by declaring that in future, no tax should be imposed upon the subject without the consent of Parliament, at the same time granting a pardon to the discontented lords and their adherents, in which pardon John de Ferrers is especially named.
Soon after this he petitioned Pope Nicholas III, to interfere to procure him the lands of his late further which he had conferred upon Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, but his suit was ineffectual. 
John was subsequently involved the Scottish wars which led to his summoning to parliament as Baron Ferrers of Chartley, in the county of Stafford on the 6th February 1299 (a seat which came into the family of Ferrers by the marriage of William, fifth Earl of Derby, with Agnes, sister and co-heir of Ranulph, Earl of Chester.)
He married Hawyse, niece and heiress of Cecilla de Muscegros, by whom he acquired a great increase in fortune. In 1273, he was again involved in the wars against Scotland and subsequently in 1288 he was constituted Seneschal of Aquitaine by Edward II.
He died in 1324 in Gascony, apparently as a result of poisoning, and was succeeded by his son Robert (later Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Baron Ferrers of Chartley).

Shalya Parva

The Shalya Parva (), or "the Book of Shalya," is the ninth of eighteen books of the Indian Epic Mahabharata. Shalya Parva has 4 sub-books and 64 chapters.
Shalya Parva describes the appointment of Shalya as the fourth commander-in-chief of the Kaurava alliance, on the 18th day of the Kurukshetra War. The parva recites Salya's death, how Duryodhana becomes mortally wounded and out of the entire Kaurava army, only 3 survive. Shalya parva also describes how Pandavas and Krishna are victorious in the war, but lament the enormous toll of the 18 day war on human lives on both sides. The book mentions the anger and hatred among survivors on the Kauravas side, particularly Duryodhana, Aswatthama, Kritavarman and Kripa.
Structure and chapters.
This "Parva" (book) has 4 sub-parvas (sub-books or little books) and 64 adhyayas (sections, chapters). The following are the sub-parvas:
After three commander-in-chiefs of Kauravas army slain, Shalya is appointed the leader. He too is killed, as is Sakuni. Millions more soldiers die on the last day of war. Duryodhana in anguish leaves the battlefield, and goes to a lake. Bhima meets him there, challenges him to a battle. Bhima mortally wounds Duryodhana by crushing his thighs.
Out of 11 Akshauhinis of the Kauravas, only survivors are mortally injured Duryodhana along with Aswatthama, Kritavarman and Kripa. From Pandavas army, all five brothers, Krishna, 2000 chariots, 700 elephants, 5000 horsemen and 10000 foot soldiers survive. Shalya parva describes the war as over with a heavy toll on human lives, Pandavas are victorious, yet a desire for revenge is brewing in Duryodhana, Aswatthama, Kritavarman and Kripa.
English translations.
Shalya Parva was composed in Sanskrit. Several translations of the book in English are available. Two translations from 19th century, now in public domain, are those by Kisari Mohan Ganguli and Manmatha Nath Dutt. The translations vary with each translator's interpretations.
Clay Sanskrit Library has published a 15 volume set of the Mahabharata which includes Shalya Parva. This translation is modern, by multiple authors and uses an old manuscript of the Epic. The translation does not remove verses and chapters now widely believed to be spurious and smuggled into the Epic in 1st or 2nd millennium AD.
Debroy, in 2011, notes that updated critical edition of Shalya Parva, after removing verses and chapters generally accepted so far as spurious and inserted into the original, has 4 sub-books, 64 adhyayas (chapters) and 3,541 shlokas (verses). Debroy has published a translated version of the critical edition of Shalya Parva in Volume 7 of his series.

EDILABO

EDILABO is a specification project, conducted by the French « Sandre » Service d’Administration Nationale des Données et des Référentiels sur l’Eau (Sandre : http://sandre.eaufrance.fr), for the structured transmission of data by electronic means between commissioners (water companies, public authorities…) and service providers (for the services “sampling” and “laboratory analysis”) in the field water.
About.
Each year in France, more than ten million water monitoring results (drinking water, surface inland water, groundwater, coastal water, wastewater…) are produced and exchanged between laboratories and their clients (sanitary or pollution control authorities, water agencies, industries,…). These data are stored in various databases using a number of formats, but also screened, combined, used or transferred.
Goals.
EDILABO goals are :
Scope.
The data scope of the version 1.0 of EDILABO specifications covers all water themes (surface and ground water, drinking water, waste water...) for all information related to physico-chemical and microbiological analysis.
The data scope of the version 2.0, under development (2008–2009), will also take into account biological sampling operations related to application of specific French methods (IBGN for oligochetes, IBD for diatoms,…) for the assessment of water biological quality, including the definition of queries and transfer of corresponding faunistic / floristic lists detailed results.
French law.
Decree of 29 November 2006, addressing approval rules for laboratories making water and aquatic environment analysis under the French Environment Code, was published in the Official Journal on 21 December 2006. Article 3 details the data interchange rules with reference to EDILABO.
Components.
EDILABO is based on :
Implementation.
For data interchange using EDILABO formats, the involved actors have to use tools compliant* to EDILABO formats. The software publishers progressively develop these tools. The Sandre makes available a free of charge tool, allowing a laboratory to produce a basic and compliant results file, from a received (EDILABO format-) query file.

Charles Symmons

Charles Symmons (1749 – 27 April 1826) was a Welsh poet and priest.
Life.
Symmons was the younger son of John Symmons, the MP for Cardigan. He was born in Cardigan in 1749 and educated at Westminster School, joining the school in 1765; he was admitted as a member of Lincoln's Inn later in the same year. He then attended the University of Glasgow in 1766, striking up a friendship with William Windham. Symmons was ordained deacon in 1773 and priest in 1774, and was appointed rector of Narberth in Pembrokeshire in 1778. He also studied at Clare College, Cambridge from 1776 to 1786, obtaining a Bachelor of Divinity degree. He was made a prebendary of St David's Cathedral in 1789.
In 1793, Symmons prepared to take his Doctor of Divinity degree at Cambridge, which required him to preach two sermons at the Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge. His moderate whig views were controversial in the wake of the trial of William Frend. One of his opponents, Thomas Kipling, sent extracts to influential clerics. Symmons protested, but decided to take his degree from the University of Oxford instead. He was incorporated as a member of Jesus College, Oxford on 29 March 1794 and received his DD two days later. His whiggish views inhibited further advancement in the church, although he was additionally appointed rector of Lampeter Velfrey, an adjoining parish to Narberth, in 1794. He failed to be appointed a prebendary of Westminster Abbey as he wished. He died at Bath on 27 April 1826, survived by his wife, two sons and three daughters.
Works.
His earliest works included a volume of sermons (1787), a tragedy "Inez" (1796) and "Constantia", a dramatic poem (1800). Family bereavements reduced his writings thereafter. His major works were a Life of Milton, prefixed to an edition of Milton's work (1806), a rhyming translation of the "Aeneid" (1817) and a "Life of Shakespeare", prefixed to an 1826 edition of Shakespeare's works.

Content wise it varies from covering the ridiculous, through to more political and social issues. Band wise, as well as documenting the local scene and bands from the label, interviews have also been conducted with more established acts such as Zeke, Million Dead and many more.
The fanzine is currently featured in an exhibition at salford Art Gallery, curated by Salford Zine Library. The film features commentary by Andy.
TNS gigs.
TNSrecords also arrange gigs. These usually feature bands that play Punk rock, Ska and other similar genres. They are usually held at Retro Bar, Gulliver's, Kraak Gallery & Base Cafe in Manchester. But sometimes take place further afield, including Blackpool, Leeds, and Macclesfield.
TNSradio.
In February 2009 TNSrecords launced TNSradio, a monthly podcast featuring Punk and Ska music. From February 2010 the podcast became a weekly show which is broadcast on American internet radio stations Punk Rock Demonstration. and Real Punk Radio. Due to a lack of time TNSrecords were unable to continue with the weekly show, with the episodes stopping in the summer of 2010. The show returned in June 2011, this time on a monthly basis, as part of the Punk Britannia weekly podcast which is broadcast on Punk Rock Demonstration and from the Studs and Punks website.
People with animal's heads.
TNSrecords often use the imagery of Human Beings, with Animal's heads. Pictures such as these often appear on advertising for TNS gigs, and also appeared on the cover of the split cd released by TNSrecords featuring Revenge of the Psychotronic Man and The Fractions. They also feature prominently in the TNSrecords Fanzine. It is unclear where or when the use, by TNSrecords, of such imagery began.
Other acts that have worked with TNS Records.
Early in 2008 TNSrecords released a Compilation CD featuring UK Punk and Ska acts, under the title Music By People Who Drink Cider In The Gutter. The CD received critical acclaim in the Manchester press as well as some note in the rest of the U.K.. There has also been some notice taken of the Compilation CD Internationally. Tracks were included by various bands:

Glen Downey (writer)

Glen Downey (born October 15, 1969) is a Canadian children’s author, teacher, and academic from Oakville, Ontario. His publications include more than ninety books for young people across a variety of genres that focus specifically on the development of child and adolescent literacy and numeracy. Downey is best known as the series editor of "Graphic Poetry," winner of both the 2010 "Texty" Award from the Text and Academic Authors Association, and the 2011 Teachers' Choice Award for Children's Books from "Learning" magazine. Downey came up with the concept for "Graphic Poetry" as a way of making poetry engaging for 21st century readers. Several of Downey's books are for award-winning educational series developed by Rubicon Publishing. These include "Boldprint, The 10, Boldprint Graphic Readers," and "Boldprint Graphic Novels".
Biography.
Downey was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and from an early age took an interest in reading. Although he was routinely encouraged by teachers to read books that would challenge him, Downey’s formative reading consisted almost exclusively of comic books, Choose Your Own Adventure novels, Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, and the manuals and rulebooks of fantasy and science-fiction role-playing games, specifically Dungeons and Dragons and BattleTech.
Downey’s interest in games eventually served to direct the course of his education. He received his B.A. from McMaster University in 1991, and his M.A. a year later, writing his Masters’ Thesis on the chess problem in Lewis Carroll’s "Through the Looking-Glass." He earned a Ph.D. in English from the University of Victoria in 1998, expanding on his previous graduate work in examining the development of the chess motif in the Victorian novel.
After teaching at both the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia, where he won the Ian Fairclough Prize for Teaching in 2000, Downey left to pursue a B.Ed. in English and Mathematics Education at the University of Western Ontario’s Althouse College. While in the program, he submitted the manuscript for his first book, "The Fifty Fatal Flaws of Essay Writing," which Althouse published in 2002. Since then, he has held a variety of teaching and administrative positions at public and private institutions, and has taught courses in Children’s Literature and Twenty-First Century Literacies in the graduate education program at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education.
Children’s Writing.
Downey’s interest in writing for children and young adults was motivated by his own formative reading experiences. He was introduced to Rubicon by David Boyd while the two were colleagues at Appleby College. Downey’s first book for Rubicon was "Games" for the award-winning "Boldprint" series. His most prolific year to date was 2009, with 47 books published across three different series. Recent work includes the Rubicon/Oxford series, "Interface," a combination of texts and online platforms designed to "help students build the skills of critical inquiry."
Awards.
Downey's books have been part of series that have won the following awards:

2008 Hargeisa–Bosaso bombings

The Hargeisa–Bosaso bombings occurred on October 29, 2008, when six suicide bombers attacked in coordinated car-bombings targets in Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, and the Puntland port of Bosaso, both in northern Somalia. The bombings killed at least 30 people.
Attack details.
Targets in Hargeisa include the presidential palace, the Ethiopian consulate, and UNDP offices, while in Bosaso the offices of the Puntland Intelligence Service were hit.
Twenty people died at Ethiopia's consulate in Hargeisa, while at least five were killed in the synchronized blasts at the local president's office and a UN building there. Two of the dead in the latter location were UN staff members, a driver and a security adviser. Six UN staff members were also injured in the blast that blew off the roofs of the UN compound. The UN humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, Mark Bowden, said: "While Somalia is one of the most dangerous places in the world for aid workers, Hargeisa has been relatively stable and consequently many United Nations staff were stationed there.""
Medical staff in Bosaso said October 30 that two more soldiers wounded in the intelligence headquarters blasts died overnight, bringing to at least five the victims of that strike."
Investigation.
Arrests.
Authorities in the Puntland said they had arrested a prominent local sheik, Mohamud Ismail, for this attack and several others in a recent wave of attacks. A relative of the sheik, Abdishakur Mire, said: "Soldiers attacked our house and opened fire on us. They injured my uncle in the arm and then took him away." Authorities declined to give further details. However, the Interior Minister, Abdillahi Ismail, said the blasts were planned from Mogadishu.
Ismail was eventually released on November 10.
Possible U.S. link.
Authorities in Minneapolis, Minnesota, were investigating whether Shirwa Ahmed, a Somali immigrant and Minneapolis resident, was one of the suicide bombers in the attack.
Reactions.
The presidents of Somaliland and Puntland condemned the bombings. Dahir Rayale Kahin, president of Somaliland, claimed that the attacks were an attack on Somaliland's "nationhood", and rare in the relatively peaceful breakaway state. He also stated that everything would be done to find out who was responsible for the attacks.
Responsible faction.
While no groups have taken responsibility for the attacks, an Islamic insurgency group, Al-Shabaab, is believed to be responsible. Suspicion fell, by at large, on Islamist insurgents in general who were fighting the Somali government and its Ethiopian military allies. Al-Shabaab posted a video of a suicide bomber on the Internet but did not explicitly link this to the attacks. The United States, however, blamed al-Qaeda, which it says works through Shabaab, for the attacks which overshadowed a summit in Kenya to discuss the 17-year-long conflict in Somalia.

Adult album alternative

Adult album alternative (also triple-A, AAA, or adult alternative) is a radio format. A spinoff from the album-oriented rock format, its roots trace to the 1960s and 1970s from the earlier freeform and progressive formats.
Format.
The format has a broader, more diverse playlist than most other formats. Musical selection tends to be on the fringe of mainstream pop and rock as well as many other music genres such as indie rock, pop rock, alternative rock, alternative country, jazz, folk, world music and blues. The musical selections tend to avoid hard rock and rap music. Some Triple-A stations bill themselves under slogans such as "World Class Rock" or "Quality Rock". Music selection also includes tracks from albums that are not singles, which leads to the enhanced and larger playlist. Some AAA outlets focus more on classic rock artists, folk and blues while others focus on more contemporary artists & modern/indie rock.
Notable artists.
AAA artists take influence from post-new wave British bands such as The Smiths and The Cure, anthemic post-punk inspired sounds of U2, acoustic folk rock (Indigo Girls, Tori Amos, Jeff Buckley, Sarah McLachlan, Fiona Apple), alternative rock (The Wallflowers, Sheryl Crow, Dave Matthews Band). The music played has gained significant exposure for artists who are considered more "organic" and songwriting oriented than traditional Top 40 or pop artists.
Popularity.
Triple-A songs sometimes do manage to chart on the Adult Top 40, modern rock, or an adult contemporary chart, since they may first break out on AAA. Additionally, "Radio and Records", a news magazine devoted to radio and the music industry, charts stations in various formats including Triple-A. Its sister publication "Billboard" also began a Triple-A chart using Radio and Records' information on July 10, 2008. Rival Mediabase 24/7 also does a Triple A chart. As of mid-2009, "Radio and Records" publications were discontinued along with the accompanying charts. As of 2010, "Billboard" publishes Triple A charts in the magazine and for its premium members on its website. Mediabase also publishes Triple A charts.
Additional charts - including Triple A's only non-commercial airplay chart - are published by FMQB, which also produces the annual Triple A Conference in Boulder, Colorado, USA, an event that grew out of the Gavin Report's Triple A Summit which was first held in 1993. FMQB took over production of the event, rebranding it as the Triple A Conference, after the closing of "Radio & Records" in 2009.

HM Prison Coldingley

HM Prison Coldingley is a Category C men's prison, located in the village of Bisley, in Surrey, England. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service.
History.
In 1991 Coldingley was hailed as a flagship prison in England. However a 2004 report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised the jail for its lack of work and training for inmates, and poor prisoner resettlement programmes.
In 2006 Coldingley was criticised again after it emerged that some inmates at the prison were are earning up to £11,000 a year for prison work as well as earning up to £1,300 in working tax credits.
In 2005, the Howard League for Penal Reform set up a graphic design studio in Coldingley which offers prisoners fully remunerated employment at market rates(now closed).
In July 2011, it was announced that along with several other prisons, Coldingley would be put up for market testing, allowing private companies as well as HM Prison service, to bid for a contract to run the prison.
The prison today.
Coldingley consists of 5 wings: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta & the new Echo Wing (October 2008). Wings A-D consist of 87 single cells and 3 doubles. Echo Wing also has single cells with a small number of doubles. E Wing houses kitchen Workers, Orderlies & inmates enrolled in the Rehabilitation of Addicted Prisoners Trust (RAPt) course.
E Wing cells have in-cell sanitation and a shower. The other wings all operate on an automated night sanitation system, which can cause problems as inmates get held in queues to use sanitation. Showers facilities are communal. 
High wages are not on offer at Coldingley anymore, but inmates can still earn up to £33 a week in the various industries located within the Prison. These industries are: Laundry, Sign Shop and Engineering. 
Coldingley also operates a Crime Diversion Scheme (CDS), in which inmates are employed. This scheme involves young first time offenders visiting the prison to hear real inmates tell them the harsh realities of the loss of liberty in the hope that this may prevent them from embarking further towards the possibility of reoffending. 
There is a brand new Education block which is slowly reaching its potential, but teaching recruiting is proving a problem, so it may be some time until it reaches its full capacity. The facilities in the education block are of a high standard. The Education department offers numerous courses, such as: Numeracy, literacy, Bookkeeping, Business Enterprise, Art, IT courses (CLAIT), preparation for work and several others.
A brand new gym was completed and opened to inmates in January 2009. The new equipment has already begun to inspire inmates and Prison officers to improve their fitness & health. The gym contains a variety of cardiovascular and weight training machines. 5 treadmills, 4 ergometers, 4 cross trainers, 2 bikes & 2 recumbent bikes (Life Fitness). Inmates are offered 7 gym sessions every fortnight. 
Coldingley has a small library, which has a reasonable selection of books.

Finsbury Square

Finsbury Square is a square in central London. It was developed in 1777 on the site of a previous area of green space to the east of London known as Finsbury Fields, in the parish of St Luke's and near Moorfields. It is sited on the east side of City Road, opposite the east side of Bunhill Fields. It is approximately 200m north of Moorgate and 400m south of Old Street. Nearby locations are Finsbury Circus and Finsbury Pavement.
It is served by bus routes 21, 43, 141, 271, 214 and 274.
History.
Past residents of the square include Pascoe Grenfell Hill, Thomas Southwood Smith and Philip Henry Pye-Smith. It has also been the site of the bookshop of James Lackington and the first home of the rabbinical seminary that became the London School of Jewish Studies (1855–81), of the Greek Orthodox church of Saint Sophia and of the Roman Catholic Church of St Mary Moorfields (1820–1900). Finsbury Square's Guildhall is the traditional home of the City of London Yeomanry (now part of the Inns of Court & City and Essex Yeomanry, and housed a stone's throw outside the old City boundaries, in Chancery Lane).
The south side of the square was known as Sodomites Walk in the 18th century and was notorious as a gay cruising area.
More recently, on 22 October 2011, Occupy London protesters began to camp on the Square.
In January 2013, the University of Liverpool announced that its London Campus would be based at 33 Finsbury Square.
