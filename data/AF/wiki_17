Jazinda

Jazinda is a Marvel Comics supporting character. She is the estranged daughter of Kl'rt the Super-Skrull. Exiled from the Skrull empire under threat of death as a traitor, she currently resides and works on Earth as part of a freelance bounty hunting team with She-Hulk.
Fictional character biography.
The daughter of the Super-Skrull, Jazinda was born on Tarnax IV but grew to adulthood on Zaragz'Na, both worlds within the Skrull empire. As of the beginning of her bounty hunting partnership with Jennifer Walters, both of these worlds had been destroyed: the former consumed by Galactus, the latter by the Annihilation Wave. Zaragz'Na's destruction also claimed the life of her brother — Kl'rt's favourite offspring — who was still living there at the time.
While working as an operative for her government, Jazinda was given the task of liberating the Sy-Torak gem — which the Skrull claimed as a sacred artifact — from the Kree. When the mission was compromised, she swallowed the gem to spite her captors only to inadvertently bond with the artifact. Granted immortality and the ability to return from the dead by this accident, she soon realised that any attempt to sever her bond with the gem would result in her permanent death; naturally, Jazinda instead chose to go on the run and eventually exiled herself to Earth. As a result of her actions, her father — unable to accept Jazinda's resourcefulness and determination to survive where her brother had died — vowed to kill her as a matter of honour. She would eventually receive his declaration of intent shortly before the events of "Secret Invasion".
While on Earth, Jazinda modified her normal appearance to resemble a Caucasian female with short brown hair and green eyes (in effect, 'removing her rubber forehead'). She eventually found herself in a position to She-Hulk's life, leveraging that action and her own fugitive state into the foundation of a mutually beneficial business arrangement. They utilised a motor home as a mobile base of operations while tracking offenders for Freeman Bonding, Inc. (the only bail bond agency willing to deal with super powered offenders). Between jobs, they resided together at Dona Little's Trailer Park. While living there, Jazinda bonded with Dona's daughter Roz over their mutual father issues, eventually leading to Jazinda using her shapechanging abilities to make Roz' father realize he needed to express his love for his daughter.
After mistakenly aiding an interstellar mass murderer attempting to escape a bounty hunter, she is killed by him when she discovers the truth and he murders a camper who had the misfortune to encounter him. After She-Hulk rescues the murdered woman's husband, Jazinda resurrects and cold-bloodedly kills the murder in revenge for his actions. She would later attempt to kill the host of the Celtic demigod Bran in order to stop his benefactor's giant-sized rampage but was unwittingly preempted from doing so by Hercules.
Secret Invasion.
Jazinda's revelation that she'd been aware of the impending invasion and had not told anyone resulted in her and She-Hulk coming to blows. They reconciled and managed to capture Nogor — a Skrull religious figure known as the Talisman, on Earth masquerading as Longshot — with the intention of using him to break the spirit of the invaders. While attempting to transport him to New York, Kl'rt arrives under the cover of the invasion to carry out his daughter's death sentence. Although She-Hulk valiantly tries to stop him, he succeeds in shooting Jazinda in the head in preparation for Noldor to remove the gem. At the last moment however Kl'rt relents, having been convinced by She-Hulk's arguments that what he was doing was wrong. Forcefully removing Nogor from the scene, he departs after asking She-Hulk to explain Jazinda's reprieve as anything other than his love for her.
Following the resolution of the invasion, Jazinda adopts the guise of a Shi'Ar warrior and joins She-Hulk, Thundra, Valkyrie II and Sue Richards to form the Lady Liberators in an attempt to redistribute stagnating international relief aid in the corrupt country of Marinmer.
During the events of Dark Reign, she is abducted on the orders of Norman Osborn by another person with a gem of Syttorak, the behemoth (formerly the Elephant man). Believing herself about to be killed and dissected by government scientists Jazinda contacts She-Hulk through a device she had secretly implanted in She-Hulk's head and tells She-Hulk to leave her to her fate and pretend they never knew one another. Her last words before being knocked out are "I've always l..." Naturally, She-Hulk and the rest of the Liberators ignore this request and rescue her.
S.W.O.R.D..
Jazinda appeared briefly in Marvel's short-lived "S.W.O.R.D." series as one of the aliens being forcibly expelled from Earth and sent back to their home planets. Given that her home planet had already been destroyed, it is unclear whether she was actually sent.
Personality.
After fleeing the Skrulls, Jazinda focused on the pragmatic concerns of her own survival, working in disguise as a bounty hunter. However, after strategically teaming up with She-Hulk as part of a business arrangement, something changed. The two women became friends, and living amongst humans combined with Jen's past heroic endeavors started Jazinda considering notions of altruism as a guiding principle. That, however, does not prevent her from killing, quite possibly in cold blood and certainly out of a sense of revenge: as she points out, she is not a hero.
Though strained on occasion, the strength of the bond that had developed between Jazinda and Jen—whom she considers her only friend in the galaxy—is demonstrated through her repeatedly expressing concern for Jen's mental well being and sense of identity following events surrounding the Civil War, and when she confesses her immortality and the fact that she's betrayed her people in acquiring the ability.
She has repeatedly demonstrated a sarcastic streak, and sometimes uses her shapeshifting abilities to drive a point home.
Familiar shape.
While working with She-Hulk, Jaz has been known to repeatedly assume the human form of Jennifer Walters. Though she seems to do so in order to confuse their quarry, she also has been seen adopting her friend's human form in times of stress. Whether any deeper significance to this action exists has yet to be revealed, though she has expressed amusement that she considers herself better at being human than her friend is.
Sexuality.
As a Skrull, Jazinda finds the disparity in Terran cultures towards the sexual activities of men and women to be strange. Her statement, along with the behavior of fellow exile Xavin, carries the implication of a similar attitude towards sexual orientation; she at one point jokes that she and Jen met through an interstellar lesbian dating service. By her own admission Jazinda's had 37 sexual partners, 5 of whom she's slept with simultaneously. It is also implied that she has a crush on She-Hulk and may have sought her out as a partner for that reason.
Powers and abilities.
In addition to her natural shape-shifting abilities as a Skrull, Jazinda's bonding with the Sy-Torak gem (Cyttorak?) has given her immortality and a phenomenal regenerative ability that allows her to resurrect herself when she is killed or otherwise dies. One such incident in which she was killed by having her neck broken saw her return to life and capture a bounty before reconnecting her severed cervical vertebrae. Another saw her body eject a bullet from her forehead some minutes 'after' she'd resurrected.

<doc id="19851539" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19851539" title="Cuticle (hair)">
Cuticle (hair)

The hair cuticle is the outermost part of the hair shaft. It is a hard shingle-like layer of overlapping cells, some five to twelve deep. It is formed from dead cells which form scales that gives the hair shaft strength and do the best job of providing protection for it. The hair cuticle is the first line of defense against all forms of damage; it acts as a protective barrier for the softer inner structure including the medulla and cortex. The cuticle is responsible for much of the mechanical strength of the hair fiber. A healthy cuticle is more than just a protective layer, as the cuticle also represents the structure that controls the water content of the fiber. Much of the shine that makes healthy hair so attractive is due to the cuticle. The hair cuticle is also said to be water resistant.
Cuticles are often damaged by excessive mechanical manipulation such as brushing, using heat (like using curling irons) or chemical processing (like perms or texturizers). Everyday elements, such as the sun or wind can cause wear and tear on hair and damage the hair cuticles as well. Although the cuticle is the outermost layer of the hair, it does not give the hair its color because it has no melanin, which is the pigment responsible; the color of a person's hair depends on what type of melanin they have, which is found in the cortex. Also cuticle cells may be elongate, acuminate (gradually tapering to a point), ovate (egg shaped), or flattened.

<doc id="19851554" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19851554" title="Cortex (hair)">
Cortex (hair)

The cortex of the hair shaft is located between the hair cuticle and medulla and is the thickest hair layer. It also contains most of the hair's pigment, giving the hair its color. The pigment in the cortex is melanin, which is also found in skin. The distribution of this pigment varies from animal to animal and person to person. In humans, the melanin is primarily denser nearer the cuticle whereas in animals, melanin is primarily denser nearer the medulla.

<doc id="19851569" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19851569" title="Medulla (hair)">
Medulla (hair)

The medulla is the innermost layer of the hair shaft.
This nearly invisible layer serves as the pith or marrow of the hair. Scientists are still stumped about the exact role of the medulla, but they speculate that it is primarily an air space that is more prominent in in-pigmented (grey or white) hair.
ref: Haircutting for Dummies J. Elaine Spear 
Importance in forensics.
Human hairs are unique in that its medullary index (the fraction of the hair shaft's diameter that the medulla occupies) is very small: generally less than 1/3. Other species will have ratios much larger, usually at least 1/2. The medulla's presence in human hair and the patterns of which differ both from person to person and from strand to strand on a single person's head. One hair may have an absent medulla while another from the same person may have a complete or fragmented medulla. For this reason, medulla patterns are not very useful as forensic evidence and are typically only used for determining the species of the subject. The medulla contains large amounts of mitochondrial (as opposed to cytoplasmic) DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is passed from the mother to her offspring. As such, mDNA may be of forensic value.

Reception.
"Toriko" is currently enjoying considerable success. Readers have consistently ranked it among the top five "Weekly Shōnen Jump" titles in the magazine's popularity polls alongside the best-sellers like "One Piece", "Naruto", "Bleach" and "Hunter x Hunter". In 2009, "Toriko" was nominated for the second annual Manga Taishō award. The first and second collected "tankōbon" volumes, both released on November 4, 2008, were ranked 10th and 11th respectively on Oricon's manga chart for their first week, with nearly 70,000 and 67,000 copies sold. It was the 10th best-selling manga series during the first half of 2011, with over 1.8 million copies sold. "Toriko" was the eleventh best-selling manga series of 2012, with over 3 million copies sold, and the thirteenth best of 2013, selling 2.8 million. The series has 18 million volumes in circulation as of November 2013. In 2011, Bandai Namco estimated "Toriko" would bring US$25.6 million in toys for the 2012 fiscal year.
"Otaku USA"'s Joseph Luster called "Toriko" "an absolute feast for fans of beasts", not able to tell "whether Shimabukuro just comes up with everything on the spot or if it's all meticulously planned out", and said that the series' charm is "how it effortlessly applies classic shonen tropes to such an outlandish world." However, he commented that "The formula of "Toriko" is apparent right from the start in true shonen fashion[...] tougher and tougher creatures will quickly follow." Deb Aoki writing for About.com also praised the imaginative beasts and monsters of the series, as well as the occasional informational bits on the true science of foods, but called the art "grotesquely goofy."
Lisa Pattillo of Anime News Network (ANN) called "Toriko" an "in-your-face action story riding on the back of a gastronomic fetch-quest." She compared Toriko's design to that of characters from "Dragon Ball" and "Fist of the North Star", and suggested this might deter some readers. ANN's Rebecca Silverman stated that "Shimabukuro has clearly devoted time and thought to crafting the story's world, as complex creatures, animal profiles, and distinctive landscapes attest.", and called his art an "odd mix of old school "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"-style manly men and newer "One Piece"-style chibis." Carlo Santos, also for ANN, praised the action, saying "For over-the-top action, it's hard to beat the thrill of Toriko punching out a swarm of giant insects, or the creep factor of a villain who literally wears another human's skin.", and called the art one of the series' highlights. Reviewing the anime, Santos said "Fans will know what to expect in each adventure: ravenous strongmen flexing their superpowers, ferocious foes being slaughtered by said strongmen, and a rich, imaginative world full of impossibly delicious foods. But the simplicity of Toriko is also its downfall: there are no clever twists in store, the characters don't develop at all, either personally or interpersonally, and even the most calculating villains are just mindless targets waiting to be knocked down one by one. The on-again, off-again animation also does a disservice to the bright colors and creative designs of the series."

Paul Lauren Montgomery (May 25, 1936 – October 16, 2008) was a longtime reporter for "The New York Times" who wrote about local and international affairs for the newspaper.
Biography.
Montgomery was an only child, born on May 25, 1936, in Brooklyn and raised in Spring Valley, New York. He attended Columbia University, graduating from the school in 1958.
He spent two years as a textbook editor before being hired by "The New York Times" in 1959. His first position with the newspaper was as a copy boy. In the early 1960s, Montgomery covered the rioting in Harlem and the civil rights movement in the Southern United States, including the Selma to Montgomery marches.
He was the "Times"' bureau chief in Rio de Janeiro from 1966 to 1969, where he traveled extensively across Latin America. Article subjects from this period included his 1967 journeys with soldiers from the Bolivian Army on their search for Che Guevara. He also wrote stories about the difficulties of life in the slums of Ecuador and coverage of clashes between federal soldiers and protesters in the Tlatelolco Massacre that took place on October 2, 1968, in Mexico City, ten days before the 1968 Summer Olympics and left an estimated 200 to 300 deaths.
A series of article he wrote in March 1970 resulted in the release of four visitors from Cuenca, Ecuador who had been charged with setting off a simultaneous detonation of incendiary devices in the Alexander's and Bloomingdale's department stores in New York City. The dismissal of charges against the group came after the New York City Police Department was able to corroborate elements of the group's story that had first been published in an article in the "Times" by Montgomery.
He left the "Times" in 1982, and wrote from Europe for "The Wall Street Journal".

Florence Claxton

Florence Anne Claxton (fl. 1840 – 1879) was an English artist and humorist, most notable for her satire on the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Claxton also wrote and illustrated many humorous commentaries on contemporary life.
Life.
Little is known of Claxton's life; even her birth and death dates are uncertain. Her father, painter Marshall Claxton, trained his daughters, Florence and Adelaide, in his craft; Florence travelled with her father to Australia, India, and Egypt in the years from 1850 to 1857, while he searched for employment. In the later 1850s both sisters found work in the production of engravings for the popular press. In 1860, Florence illustrated "Married Off: A Satirical Poem", by "H. B."
In 1858 Florence exhibited her painting "Scenes from the Life of a Female Artist" in the second annual show of the Society of Women Artists. In the following year, 1859, she signed a petition advocating the admission of women to the Royal Academy Schools, and exhibited her "Scenes of Life of an Old Maid" in the Society of Women Artists show.
The Choice of Paris.
Claxton's best-known work is "The Choice of Paris: An Idyll" (c. 1860), a satire on, and parody of, the works of the Pre-Raphaelite artists of the previous years. The painting is patterned after William Holman Hunt's "A Converted British Family sheltering a Christian Missionary from the persecution of the Druids", and combines caricatures of many of the main figures of the movement, including John Ruskin and Sir John Everett Millais, with figures of popular culture like P. T. Barnum, and allusions to the great artists of the past. It depicts Millais in the role of Paris, offering the golden apple to a scrawny-looking medieval woman, ignoring a Raphael madonna (copied from "The Marriage of the Virgin") and a modern woman in crinolines. The painting also includes parodies of other Pre-Raphaelite works, including Millais' "Sir Isumbras at the Ford", "Spring: Apple Blossoms" and "The Vale of Rest". It also caricatures Calderon's "Broken Vows" and Windus's "Burd Helen"'. The picture was reproduced as a full-page engraving by the Illustrated London News.
Other works.
Other examples of Claxton's works were also reproduced in newspapers of the day. In "Utopian Christmas", reproduced in the "Illustrated London News" of 24 December 1859, the poor - barefooted and raggedly-dressed - are shown feasting at a lavish banquet and being served and entertained by the rich - depicted as generals, nobles, and finely-dressed ladies.
Other works by Claxton include "Women's Work: A Medley" (1861) and "Scenes from the Life of a Governess" (1863). "Women's Work" may have been a feminist riposte to Ford Madox Brown's painting "Work", which focused on men's labors but neglected women.
Florence Claxton married a "Mr. Farrington, of Romsey," in 1868, but continued to work and exhibit at least sporadically afterward.
Claxton also wrote humorous skits on feminism and women's rights, most notably in "The Adventures of a Woman in Search of her Rights", a story in cartoon form. In the book, a young woman falls in love with a dashing youth, but her parents do not approve and her lover leaves. She decides to pursue her rights. She loses her looks through much study; now made ugly, she pursues various careers, becoming a lawyer, a politician and a doctor, but eventually fails in all of her pursuits. She finally emigrates to the United States and marries Brigham Young, the polygamous Mormon leader. In the end, it turns out to have been all a dream and she ends with the words "thank goodness it's only a midsummer night's dream and I'm not emancipated".

Early life.
Galen Clark Noris was born on November 7, 1915. He resided in the small town of Erskine, Alberta just west of Stettler.
Political career.
First term.
Norris was first elected to serve in the Alberta Legislature in a by-election held in the Stettler provincial electoral district on November 16, 1956. The by-election was caused by the death of former Social Credit MLA John E. Clark. Norris ran against a single opponent, Murray Rairdan representing the provincial Liberals. On election night Norris won a healthy majority of 61.79 percent of the popular vote cast. He easily held the district for the governing Social Credit party. 
Norris took his seat for the first time to sit with the Social Credit caucus on February 15, 1957 during the third session of the 13th Legislative Assembly. He was appointed to sit on a total of five standing committee's in his first term in office. Norris was appointed as the Chairman for the Standing Committee for "Law Amendments". He also served as a regular member of the Standing Committee for "Municipal Law"; "Public Accounts; "Privileges and Elections; and "Railways, Telephones and Irrigation". Norris did not move and bills or motions in the third session, but he did second the motion to move the speech from the throne.
Norris participated in ? recorded votes during his first term in office. He recorded his first vote on February 19, 1957 voting to defeat a Liberal motion introduced by Lac La Biche MLA Michael Maccagno, calling for the Social Credit government to study ways to give Alberta adequate Air Ambulance service in the province. A week later Norris voted in favor of an almost unanimous motion introduced by Olds MLA Frederick Niddrie to call on the Parliament of Canada to repeal section 12 of the "Indian Act". A few days later Norris would vote against to defeat a motion introduced by Liberal MLA from Vermilion Russell Whitson to have the government cover the cost for farmers of halving calves vaccinated against Brucellosis.
The most contentious vote of Norris' first term in the Assembly came on March 12, 1957 in order to adopt a motion to create the 1957 Alberta liquor plebiscite. The vote was hotly contested with a number of Social Credit MLAs breaking the party line to vote in favor of it. Norris voted against holding the plebiscite, but the vote was won 28 to 27. Norris voted on the only bill during the session to have a recorded vote. Bill 95 introduced by Cardston MLA Edgar Hinman. The bill gave royalty payments to Alberta citizens from oil and gas revenues and was strongly opposed by the opposition parties. Norris voted in favor of this bill. He also voted against a motion to record Assembly proceedings by Hansard and voted to keep a prohibition on farmers using tax free purple gas to drive farm vehicles on roadways.
At the beginning of the 4th session, Norris was appointed to serve on a special committee to appoint members to regular committee's.
Second term.
Norris ran for a second term in office in the 1959 general election. He won his second term with a large majority this time against four other candidates. He defeated second place Gordon Taylor of the Progressive Conservatives. The Liberals which finished second in the by-election, dropped to third place under future MLA Henry Kroeger. Norris would see his popular vote increase with the higher voter turnout, but his overall percentage was almost unchanged.
Norris was re-appointed to all his previous committee postings in the 14th Legislative Assembly.
Third term.
He won election to a third term in office in the 1963 Alberta general election.
Fourth term.
On October 24, 1967, Norris was appointed as a Commissioner of Oaths for the Province of Alberta.

George Mount

George Lewis Mount (born September 14, 1955) is an American former professional cyclist.<br> Mount was sixth at the 1976 Montreal Olympics road race which launched his professional career and propelled the US into post-war international cycling.
Mount raced professionally in the US and Europe, the first American to break into European road racing. In 1997 Mount was inducted to the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame. He earned the nickname ""Smilin' George"".
Races.
Mount was born in Princeton, New Jersey in 1955. He refused to register for the draft (conscription had already ended) and his father told him to leave home. He met Berkeley, California cycling enthusiast and race promoter, Peter Rich. Mount moved into a room above Rich's bicycle shop and worked for him as a mechanic. Rich called him 
"... a cocky pop-off, a pleasant smart aleck. But he obviously had great potential, great pedaling form. He had a powerful smoothness about him. He would pedal without wasting energy." Peter Rich coached Mount and another youth, Mike Neel, on an old velodrome at Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. 
Mount began racing in 1973 as a junior and competed in about 15 events. In 1974 he won two local races, Mount Hamilton and Mount Tamalpias and competed in many as a category-one racer. In 1975, Mount said, 
He rode with the Pan American Games team in Mexico City and in 1976, with Neel, the Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada. He finished sixth to Bernt Johansson of Sweden despite crashing. No American had finished in the top 60 since 1912, nor ever in the top 10. The historian Peter Nye said: 
"For the first time in memory, Mount made the prospect of an Olympic cycling medal a distinct possibility." 
Mount won a gold medal in the Pan American Games in 1979 and was a favorite for the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.
In 1977 Mount moved to Castelfranco di Sopra in Italy - Neel had already gone there and he arranged an introduction - and competed for a small club team, Benotto, winning a number major races. Mount said: 
The choice of Italy was easy because he'd asked Eddy Merckx's advice. The Belgian had gone to Pennsylvania with Patrick Sercu and, Mount remembered: 
In 1978 he raced for the US national team for most of the season in Europe, winning respect. He came fourth in the Tour of Britain, known as the Milk Race, and won the Tour of Colorado (Coors Classic). In the USA he won the Red Zinger Bicycle Classic. Peter Nye wrote:
"In major European events, the powerful Mount was often at the head of the pack... He won a stage of France's pro-am Circuit de la Sarthe and finished first in the Tour de l'Auvergne. Under revised rules governing amateurs, he won $4,000 when he captured the Apple Lap, the 75-mile race through New York City's five boroughs, and set a national record for 75 miles on the way."
Mount raced most of that season in Europe and became the first American in modern history to win a professional/open race, turning professional because the USA decided against sending a team to the Moscow Olympics. He joined an Italian team, Magniflex, described by John Wilcockson of "VeloNews" in the USA as "a barebones team." He raced in Italy for three years, finished the Tour of Italy in 20th and 25th places and rode most of the classics. After three years of riding for his team leaders, he was burned out. He said:
Legacy.
Mount won more than 200 races, in the US, Europe, and South America. He competed in five world championships on the road, and won national and district titles and medals on road and track. He held numerous records, including national distance records, which stood for years. "San Francisco Weekly" said: 
"George Mount's accomplishments helped start the craze, returning the country to the bicycling dignity it enjoyed during the 1890s, 1910s, and 1920s, when bike-crazy Americans first embraced modernity, and when it seemed this country's ethos of optimism would become a driving force for all the world."
He now lives in the Bay Area of San Francisco, is married with two daughters and works for a high tech company in Silicon Valley. The "San Francisco Weekly" said: 
"Navigating among the couches and highchairs, potted plants and baby toys that clutter his Redwood City tract house, George Mount doesn't strike one at first as the champion of an epoch. His severe visage has softened over the years; he's lost a bike racer's gauntness. The delight he takes in talking about his 10-month-old daughter, Eleanor, or his wife, Caryne, doesn't much resemble the delight a racer takes in making an opponent suffer climbing up a hill."

Ryan Tannehill

Ryan Timothy Tannehill III (born July 27, 1988) is an American football quarterback for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Texas A&M. The Miami Dolphins selected him with the eighth overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft.
Early years.
Ryan Tannehill was born in Lubbock, Texas, but grew up in Big Spring, Texas. He attended Big Spring High School, where he played high school football and basketball. He played 10 games at defensive back his sophomore season. As a junior, he passed for 2,510 yards and rushed for 922 at quarterback. He took his team to the playoffs as a senior, passing for 5,258 yards and rushing for another 617. He had to miss two games due to a separated shoulder in the second game of his senior year. He also posted three receptions for 62 yards and compiled a 39.2 punt average with a long of 84 yards as a senior. He received second-team District 4-4A honors for both his sophmore, junior, and senior seasons.
College career.
2007 season.
Tannehill redshirted his first season (2007) at A&M.
2008 season.
Prior to Tannehill's second season, Mike Sherman took over as head coach. In summer camp, Tannehill competed against veteran quarterback Stephen McGee and redshirt sophomore Jerrod Johnson for the starting quarterback position. He finished third in the contest, behind Johnson and then McGee. Sherman, whose offense utilizes true receivers, moved him to wide receiver.
In his fifth game, he posted freshman school records of 210 yards on 12 catches. After his six receptions for 78 yards in the Iowa State game, he broke the freshman school records for receptions and receiving yards. Tannehill finished his redshirt freshman season with 844 receiving yards, which was 11 yards shy of breaking Robert Ferguson's record set in 2000. He attempted only one pass at quarterback the whole season.
Tannehill had expressed his desire to become the starting quarterback at A&M: "I still think of myself as a quarterback, I still want to be a quarterback here at A&M. Hopefully that’s the way it turns out. But if things don’t happen that way, and Coach thinks I can better help being a receiver, then I guess I’m okay with that."
2009 season.
During the 2009 offseason, Tannehill and Jerrod Johnson competed for the starting quarterback position; the job went to Johnson.
Tannehill finished the 2009 season with a team-leading 46 receptions for 609 yards and four touchdowns. About 80% of his 46 catches went for first downs or touchdowns. He picked up All-Big 12 Honorable Mention honors for his performance. He only took eight snaps at quarterback the entire season.
2010 season.
Tannehill continued to play receiver during the first six games of the 2010 season. Over those six games, he made 11 catches for 143 yards. He attempted 4 passes during the season opener.
He saw extensive action at quarterback during the Kansas game, splitting time with starter Jerrod Johnson. Tannehill finished with 12-for-16 passes for 155 yards and three touchdowns. In his first career start at quarterback, Tannehill led the Aggies to a 45–27 victory over Texas Tech. He set a school record with his 449 passing yards. He also made a 33-yard pooch punt, his first career kick.
Tannehill quarterbacked the Aggies to a victory over No. 11 Oklahoma, which moved the team into the top 25. He helped the team maintain the top 25 ranking through victories over Baylor and No. 9 Nebraska. During the Nebraska game, he punted twice since the starter was injured. He and his team defeated Texas to finish off the regular season. He picked up All-Big 12 Honorable Mention honors.
2011 season.
In 2011, Tannehill started all 13 games (including the bowl game) at quarterback for the Aggies and served as team captain. He threw for 3,744 yards and 29 touchdowns, with 15 interceptions. He completed 61.6% of his passes and posted a quarterback rating of 133.2. He also ran for 3 touchdowns.
Tannehill concluded his quarterback career at Texas A&M with a total of 5,450 passing yards 42 Touchdown passes and 21 interceptions.
College statistics.
"Through the completion of the 2011 season".
Professional career.
Tannehill ran the 40-yard dash in 4.58 seconds at his pro day. He was considered the #4 quarterback prospect in the 2012 NFL Draft class behind Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, and Brandon Weeden.
In the 2012 NFL Draft, the Miami Dolphins selected Tannehill with the 8th overall pick. He was the first quarterback selected by the Dolphins in the first round since Dan Marino in 1983. He became the 13th starting quarterback by the Miami Dolphins since Dan Marino and only the 2nd quarterback taken 1st round in franchise history following Hall of famer and Dan Marino.
On July 28, 2012, Tannehill signed a four-year contract with the Dolphins worth approximately $12.684 million, with an option for a 5th year, as reported by the Miami Herald.
On August 20, 2012, Tannehill was named the starting quarterback for the season opener against the Houston Texans. He was the 17th starting quarterback since Dan Marino retired.
2012 season.
In week 1 of the 2012 NFL season, Tannehill started his first career regular season game which ended in a 30–10 loss. He finished with 219 yards, zero touchdowns and three interceptions. Two of his three interceptions were tipped at the line of scrimmage by defensive end J. J. Watt of the Houston Texans. In response to Tannehill's performance, Joe Philbin stated “We’ve (also) got to do a better job in (pass) protection, and at times the receivers have to protect the throw from the quarterback. So I would say, as is usually the case, there is a little bit of culpability across the board.”
In week 2 of the 2012 NFL season, Tannehill improved dramatically in a 35–13 win over the Oakland Raiders. Tannehill passed for an even 200 yards, with one touchdown and zero interceptions, as well as 14 yards on the ground to go along with one rushing score. Tannehill seemed to fix his tipped ball problem by having zero passes batted down in week 2.
By the end of week 3, Tannehill had completed less than than 53% of his passes, and also had only 1 touchdown to four interceptions.
In week 4 against the Arizona Cardinals, Tannehill threw for 431 yards, surpassing the Dolphins' single-game record for most passing yards by a rookie quarterback, set by Dan Marino in 1983. Tannehill's mark was 1 yard shy of the NFL's single-game passing-yard record by a rookie quarterback, set by Carolina's Cam Newton in 2011. He threw for 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions in the 24–21 OT loss to the Cardinals. In week 16, Tannehill set a franchise record for longest run by a quarterback by rushing 31 yards in a single play. The previous record was set by Pat White who had a 30-yard run during the 2009 season. During that week 16 game against Buffalo, Tannehill also became the fifth quarterback in team history to surpass 3,000 passing yards in a season.
Tannehill went on to set franchise rookie records for passing yards, attempts, and completions.
2013 Season.
Tannehill started his 2nd season on the road against the Browns in Week 1. He went 24/38 for 272 yards a touchdown, an interception, and was sacked 4 times in the 23–10 win.
In Week 2, Tannehill and his Dolphins traveled to Indianapolis to take on the offense led by Andrew Luck, also a 2nd-year QB. Tannehill went 23/34 for 319 yards for a touchdown but also was sacked 5 times and lost a fumble in the 24–20 win.
In Week 3, Tannehill went home for the first time, taking on the Falcons. He went 24/35 for 236 yards for 2 touchdowns, an interception, got sacked 5 times and lost a fumble in the close 27–23 win. He led his team to a 3–0 start for the first time since 2002.
In Week 4, the young QB struggled on the road against the Saints. He went 22/35 for 249 yards and also a touchdown pass, but also committed 4 team turnovers as he was intercepted 3 times and lost a fumble. He was sacked 4 times in the 38–17 loss.
In Week 5, he and his team headed back home to take on the Ravens. His team could not hold on after leading 13–6 at halftime. He went 21/40 for 307 yards and threw a touchdown, and was also sacked 6 times in the 26–23 loss.
In Week 7, Tannehill went 19/37 for 194 yards and threw 3 touchdown passes, 2 interceptions and lost a fumble while being sacked twice in the 23–21 home loss to the Bills.
In Week 8, Tannehill and the Dolphins traveled to Foxborough to take on the Patriots as he went 22/42 for 192 yards throwing 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions, losing a fumble, and being sacked 6 times in the 27–17 loss.
In Week 9, the Dolphins traveled back home to take on the Bengals. Tannehill struggled as he went 16/28 for 108 yards but was able to sneak in a 1-yard TD run despite being sacked 6 times due to the tottering offensive line in the 22–20 win in OT.
In Week 10, the Dolphins traveled to take on the winless Buccaneers as Tannehill's stats got better despite losing the game 22–19. He went 24/49 for 209 yards while throwing 2 touchdowns and an interception. Also, he was sacked 4 times.
Personal life.
Tannehill graduated with a bachelor's degree in biology in May 2011 and had planned to become an orthopedic surgeon. Ryan and his wife Lauren Tannehill, whom he met at Texas A&M, were married in January 2012.

John Miller FRSE (26 July 1805 – 8 May 1883) was a Scottish civil engineer and Liberal Party politician. He was born in Ayr and died in Edinburgh. He went into partnership with Thomas Grainger in 1825. The partnership was responsible for many of Scotland's great railway projects. Miller took the lead role in surveying the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. He designed many viaducts, including the Lugar Viaduct, Cumnock and the Ballochmyle Viaduct, Mauchline. A plaque commemorating his life was unveiled at Haymarket railway station on the 200th anniversary of his birth. In 2012 a memorial was unveiled at , funded by the Institution of Civil Engineers.
As John Miller of Leithen, he unsuccessfully contested the Stirling Burghs at the 1852 general election, and was defeated again in Edinburgh at the 1865 general election. He was elected unopposed as one of two Members of Parliament for Edinburgh at the 1868 general election, but at the 1874 election he lost his seat to another Liberal candidate, James Cowan.

Alfred Hauge

Alfred Hauge (17 October 1915 - 31 October 1986) was a Norwegian novelist, poet and historian. Hauge wrote extensively about life on the Ryfylke islands and about Norwegian-American emigration.
Biography.
Hauge was born and grew up on the island of Kyrkjøy in Sjernarøy, part of Finnøy municipality in Rogaland County, Norway.
Hauge is best known for describing the life and adventures of Cleng Peerson, a pioneer Norwegian immigrant to the United States in the 1820s. His trilogy included: "Hundevakt" (1961; "Midwatch”), "Landkjenning" (1964; "Land Sighting"), and "Ankerfeste" (1965; “Anchoring”). This collected work was published as "Cleng Peerson" in Norway during 1968. An English-language version was translated by Eric J. Friis and published under the same title during 1975. This publication was released as one of the official publications of the Norwegian Immigration Sesquicentennial.
Hauge received numerous literary awards during his career. In 1955, Hauge won the Gyldendal's Endowment, a literature prize which was awarded by the Norwegian publisher Gyldendal Norsk Forlag. In recognition of his work he was also awarded the Norwegian Critics Prize for Literature in 1965.
A memorial to Hauge has been erected on Kyrkjøy at Sjernarøy church (Norwegian: "Sjernarøy kirke"), an historic wooden church which dates to 1636. Composer Hallvard Johnsen wrote an opera based upon Alfred Hauge's "Legenden om Svein og Maria". The opera was first performed on 3 September 1973 by The Norwegian Opera and Ballet (Norwegian: "Den Norske Opera & Ballet") in Oslo.

<doc id="19851994" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19851994" title="Trade (sports)">
Trade (sports)

In professional sports, a trade is a sports league transaction involving an exchange of players' contracts or draft picks between sports clubs. Cash is another commodity that may be packaged together with contracts or draft picks to complete a trade. Typically, trades are completed between two clubs, but there are instances where trades are consummated between three or more clubs.
Trade bait.
"Trade bait" refers to a player on a team used to entice another team into making a trade with them. Occasionally, it just refers to a player that is traded often or any player that is traded at all. For example, John Wockenfuss was used as trade bait in 1984, when the Detroit Tigers sent him along with Glenn Wilson to the Philadelphia Phillies for Willie Hernández and Dave Bergman.
No-trade clause.
A no-trade clause is an amendment to a contract, usually relevant in American professional sports, wherein a player may not be traded to another club. Sometimes this clause is implemented by the club itself, but the vast majority are requested by the athlete and his or her sports agent. In many cases, these no-trade clauses are limited, where a club may be limited to trading the athlete only at certain times, or only to a certain team or geographical area. 
No-trade clauses are found in most sports in the United States, including Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, and some minor leagues around the country. Many European leagues, mostly professional soccer and basketball, also implement these contract amendments.
Each league usually has its own rules regarding these clauses; for example in the NBA, no-trade clauses can only be negotiated into contracts when a player has at least four years of service for the team he's signing the contract with and at least eight years total in the NBA. Other leagues have other varying rules, for example in MLB the "Ten and Five" rule gives mostly every player limited control on his tradability once he meets the ten and five criteria, which means the player has played in the league ten seasons and with the current team for at least five. In the NHL, these rights have been blamed for the lack of trades that have been pulled off in recent years, with critics citing examples where "done deals" were blown up by "selfish players."
Waiver of no-trade clause.
Often the no-trade clause is waived by the players themselves, usually in order to play for a contending team. 
MLB 
In one dramatic case in 2001, Tampa Bay Devil Rays first baseman Fred McGriff mulled over waiving his rights for nearly a month before ultimately accepting a deal which sent him to the Chicago Cubs. 
NBA 
In 2007, Kobe Bryant was willing to waive his own rights with the Los Angeles Lakers in order to be dealt to either the Phoenix Suns or the Chicago Bulls, but in this case Bryant's own pickiness as far as where he would like to play limited the Lakers' ability to move him and eventually no trade was made at all. 
NHL
Darryl Sittler's no-trade clause protected him from being moved, when owner Harold Ballard and manager Punch Imlach wanted to get rid of or reduce Sittler's influence on the team; a few years later Sittler waived the clause when relations between him and Ballard deteriorated. Dany Heatley demanded a trade from the Senators at the end of the 2008–09 season, and a deal was in place to send Heatley to the Edmonton Oilers on June 30 but Heatley refused to waive his no-trade clause (the Oilers had missed the playoffs for 3 straight seasons), so he was traded to the San Jose Sharks instead.Rick Nash of the Columbus Blue Jackets demanded a trade during the 2011-12 NHL season but the deal could not be completed due to Scott Howson's high asking price from the teams Nash waived his clause to which was the Pittsburgh Penguins, Detroit Red Wings, New York Rangers, Boston Bruins, San Jose Sharks, or the Philadelphia Flyers. The holdout lasted into the summer of 2012 where he was traded for : Brandon Dubinsky, Tim Erixon, Artem Anisimov, and the Rangers first round pick in the 2013 draft.
In an unusual case, Mats Sundin refused to waive his no-trade clause during the latter part of the 2007-08 season, even though his Toronto Maple Leafs were on track to miss the playoffs and his contract was set to expire after the season concluded. Leafs management requested that Sundin waive his no-trade clause in order for the team to rebuild by acquiring potential young talent and/or draft picks, and Sundin was coveted by several teams looking to bolster their roster for the playoffs before the trade deadline. Sundin said he did not believe in being a "rental player" and that if he won the Stanley Cup, he wanted to do it over the course of a whole season. 
Trade deadline.
A trade deadline (or trading deadline) is a rule regulating the trading of professional players' contracts between clubs. Usually players acquired through trade after the trade deadline are ineligible for postseason play in that season, unless the respective league allows them to replace an injured player on the roster. In some leagues, post-deadline trades may be banned entirely. This term is used mainly in North America. In the approach to the deadline, there is heightened activity and interest in trades.
MLB.
The Major League Baseball (MLB) non-waiver deadline is July 31. After the All-Star break, teams will determine whether or not they are in position to contend for the post-season. Because of free agency and the lack of a salary cap in baseball, players in the final year of their contract are often put on the "trading block" by many of the non-playoff contending teams. Smaller market teams will not — or cannot afford to — pay their better veteran players high salaries, so they will attempt to trade them to a post-season contender, in exchange for some minor-league prospects or other players who might be able to help them in the future.
The MLB waiver deadline is August 31. There is much less activity between July 31 and August 31 because players must clear waivers. Players may be acquired after the August 31 deadline; however, while they can contribute to a team's push for the playoffs, they are ineligible for postseason play.
The trade deadline was instituted by MLB in response to various attempts by two New York City-based ballclubs, the Giants and Yankees, to use its financial advantages to tilt its respective leagues' competitive balance in their favor from 1917 through 1922. In the Yankees' case, most of its dealings were with the Boston Red Sox. The American League (AL) established MLB's first-ever such rule in 1920 as an indirect result of the Red Sox's sale of Babe Ruth to the Yankees. It prohibited the trading and selling of ballplayers between August 1 and the conclusion of the World Series. A uniform rule serving both major leagues, which was adopted prior to the 1923 season, set the deadline at June 15. The date, chosen by MLB Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis based on a suggestion from Pittsburgh Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss, remained in effect through the 1985 season. The rule in its current form originated with the 1986 Basic Agreement which resulted from the resolution of the 1985 MLB strike.
NBA.
The National Basketball Association's deadline falls on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3pm Eastern Time. Although due to the shortened 2011-2012 season caused by a lockout the NBA Trade Deadline was on March 15, 2012. In the NBA, post-deadline trades are forbidden.
NFL.
The National Football League's deadline is the Tuesday following the eighth week (formerly sixth) of the regular season, which typically falls in mid-October. However, this was changed for the 2012 NFL season, with the deadline being moved ahead two weeks in hopes of more trade activity at the deadline.
Usually, there is fairly little activity on this day and almost no star players are ever dealt to other clubs on the sixth week of the season. The early deadline, along with players having to learn a whole new system on the fly, along with the salary cap often makes it difficult to make blockbuster trades on this day, unlike most other sports.
NHL.
The National Hockey League's trade deadline is typically the last Monday of February. Much like Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, the NHL's trade deadline is often a period of increased player movement, especially between teams who are out of playoff contention and teams who are seeking to improve their chances in the postseason. Like in the NBA, post-deadline trades are forbidden in the NHL.
Association football.
Association football clubs have two transfer windows per season. In most countries, one falls during the middle of the season and the other runs during the period between seasons, generally called the "close season" in Europe and "off-season" in North America. For those countries with seasons starting in August/September such as most European countries, the midseason transfer window usually falls in January, and the other one opens from June to September. In countries with seasons that operate entirely within a calendar year, like the leagues in Latin America or Northern Europe, the midseason transfer window opens in July/August, while the other starts from March to April. The difference between a transfer window and a trade deadline is that players cannot be bought or sold outside these transfer window periods. The notion of transfer windows was initially introduced in Europe, and subsequently adopted by FIFA. Like North America's trade deadline, there is greatly increased activity and interest as the close of a transfer window draws near.

Joseph J. Sullivan

Joseph J. "Sport" Sullivan (1870-?) was an American bookmaker and gambler from Boston, Massachusetts who helped to initiate the 1919 Black Sox Scandal.
Biography.
Sullivan was a known gambler in the Boston area who reportedly bet heavily on the 1903 World Series and was arrested for gambling on baseball in 1907. In 1919, Sullivan was living in the Boston suburb of Sharon, Massachusetts. In September 1919, Sullivan met with Chicago White Sox' first baseman Charles Arnold 'Chick' Gandil at Boston's Hotel Buckminster and conspired with Gandil to perpetrate a fix of the 1919 World Series. It has been disputed which of the two men initiated the meeting. Gandil had known Sullivan since 1912, and he later maintained that Sullivan approached him concerning the plot to throw the series. At Sullivan's suggestion, Gandil recruited several teammates to intentionally lose the games. Sullivan met with noted organized crime boss Arnold Rothstein, who agreed to bankroll the fix for $80,000. Rothstein provided an initial $40,000 for Sullivan to distribute to the involved players; however Sullivan kept $30,000 for his own wagering and gave only $10,000 to Gandil. 
After the scheme had been exposed, Sullivan did not testify in front of the Chicago grand jury hearing in October 1920, because William J. Fallon, the lawyer of Arnold Rothstein, persuaded Sullivan not to do so. If Sullivan did testify, it would probably expose the fact that Rothstein has been the one providing the money for the Black Sox players to fix the Series. Still, he was later indicted on nine counts of conspiracy to defraud. Sullivan reportedly was paid by Rothstein to flee to Mexico so that he would not go to Chicago to testify in front of the Grand Jury. Sullivan was never arrested nor appeared at the trial, which started in June 27, 1921. The trial ended in an acquittal for all the defendants.
Sullivan appeared at Yankee Stadium during the 1926 World Series. He was recognized by Ban Johnson, who had police escort Sullivan out of the stadium.
Legacy.
Sullivan's life was dramatized in Brendan Boyd's 1991 historical fiction "Blue Ruin: A Novel of the 1919 World Series" which retells the Black Sox Scandal through Sullivan's narration.
Sullivan was portrayed by Kevin Tighe in the 1988 film "Eight Men Out".
He was also mentioned (despite not appearing as a character) in "Boardwalk Empire".

<doc id="19852067" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19852067" title="Pop music automation">
Pop music automation

Pop music automation is a field of study among musicians and computer scientists with a goal of producing successful pop music algorithmically. It is often based on the premise that pop music is especially formulaic, unchanging, and easy to compose. The idea of automating pop music composition is related to many ideas in algorithmic music, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computational creativity.
Overview: automation in music.
Algorithms (or, at the very least, formal sets of rules) have been used to compose music for centuries; the procedures used to plot voice-leading in Western counterpoint, for example, can often be reduced to algorithmic determinacy. Now the term is usually reserved, however, for the use of formal procedures to make music without human intervention.
Classical music automation software exists that generates music in the style of Mozart and Bach and jazz. Most notably, David Cope has written a software system called "Experiments in Musical Intelligence" (or "EMI") that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style. EMI's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human-generated to a high level of competence.
Creativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and the cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent: reasoning about time, remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played, and planning ahead for what might be played next.
Inevitably associated with Pop music automation is Pop music analysis.
Projects in Pop music automation may include, but are not limited to, ideas in melody creation and song development, vocal generation or improvement, automatic accompaniment and lyric composition.
Automatic accompaniment.
Some systems exist that automatically choose chords to accompany a vocal melody in real-time. A user with no musical experience can create a song with instrumental accompaniment just by singing into a microphone.
An example is a Microsoft Research project called Songsmith, which trains a Hidden Markov Model using a music database and uses that
model to select chords for new melodies.
Melody generation.
Automatic melody generation is often done with a Markov chain, the states of the system become note or pitch values, and a probability vector for each note is constructed, completing a transition probability matrix (see below). An algorithm is constructed to produce and output note values based on the transition matrix weightings, which could be MIDI note values, frequency (Hz), or any other desirable metric.
A second-order Markov chain can be introduced by considering the current state "and" also the previous state, as indicated in the second table. Higher, "n"th-order chains tend to "group" particular notes together, while 'breaking off' into other patterns and sequences occasionally. These higher-order chains tend to generate results with a sense of phrasal structure, rather than the 'aimless wandering' produced by a first-order system.
Lyric composition.
Automated lyric creating software may take forms such as:
The Tra-la-Lyrics system produces song lyrics, in Portuguese, for a given melody. This not only involves matching each word syllable with a note in the melody, but also matching the word's stress with the strong beats of the melody.
This involves natural language processing.
Pablo Gervás has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a case-base of existing poems. Each poem fragment in the ASPERA case-base is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment, and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment. Metrical rules are then used to combine these fragments into a well-formed poetic structure.
Programs like TALE-SPIN
On-line metaphor generation systems like 'Sardonicus' or 'Aristotle' can suggest lexical metaphors for a given descriptive goal (e.g., to describe a supermodel as skinny, the source terms “pencil”, “whip”, “whippet”, “rope”, “stick-insect” and “snake” are suggested). 
Using a language database (such as wordnet) one can create musings on a subject that may be weak grammatically but are still sensical. See such projects as the Flowerewolf automatic poetry generator or the 
Dada engine.

List of Elvis Presley hit albums

This is a list of hit albums by Elvis Presley.
This is not an all inclusive list of albums released by Elvis Presley; literally hundreds of Elvis Presley albums have been released, most after his death in 1977. This is a list of hit albums that made national charts and/or received Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sales certification. The number of hit albums an artist had is an important measure of the artist's success and popular impact, though it is by no means the only measure. Elvis Presley had a worldwide impact on popular music and culture, as shown by his success on album charts throughout the world. His international success is even more remarkable considering that except for three 1957 Canadian concerts, Elvis did not perform outside of the United States.
Another measure of an artist's popular impact is sales. While Elvis is recognized by many in the recording industry as the best selling artist of all time, the RIAA, the US recording industry's official certifiing agent for sales, stirred up controversy in November 2007 when it announced that country singer Garth Brooks had become the best selling solo artist in US history.
Elvis Presley Enterprises has disputed the RIAA's claim, pointing out several omissions in the RIAA's figures. The RIAA bases its claim on album sales only, and does not include single sales in determining the highest selling solo artist, despite the fact that the RIAA also certifies single sales. While Elvis' album sales are significant, as can be seen in the tables below, his single sales were also significant. During much of Elvis' career in the 1950s and 1960s, single sales were considered the primary market for the industry, while albums were a secondary market. It was not until the late 1960s and early 1970s that albums became the primary market for the industry.
RIAA does not certify sales of less than 500,000 units for albums and singles. Elvis has had numerous albums and singles which have sold hundreds of thousands of units each but have not reached the 500,000 threshold. Taken together, these could add up to millions in total sales that are not recognized by the RIAA.
RIAA sales certifications are not automatic. The record company must pay a fee and request an audit from the RIAA in order to certify sales. During Elvis' life, RCA submitted few of Elvis' recordings for RIAA certification. Instead of paying for RIAA certification, RCA and other companies would simply award their own "Gold Record" to artists based on their internal sales figures. As a consequence, some of Elvis' early sales information has been lost. RCA and BMG have researched archives and old files in an effort to reconstruct Elvis' sales figures. This has led to Elvis receiving numerous RIAA certifications posthumously.

Elvis begins his musical comeback in late 1968 with his NBC TV Special. In 1973 his "Aloha from Hawaii" TV special is broadcast worldwide and seen by more than 1 billion viewers. Soon after his death in 1977, another TV special, "Elvis In Concert" is broadcast in the US. Soundtrack albums for all three specials are released soon after the performances.
1978–1999.
After Elvis' death numerous compilations and repackaged albums are released and re-released.
2000–present.
Elvis experiences a resurgence in popularity after the release of "Elv1s 30 Number 1 Hits" CD and the "A Little Less Conversation" remix in 2002, the 25th anniversary of his death. Billboard begins publishing a European Hot 100 albums chart (EUR). The expiration of European copyrights on Elvis' early recordings beginning in 2006 leads to a plethora of independent and third-party releases of Elvis compilation albums.

Jan Kobylański

Jan Kobylański (born 21 July 1923 in Rowne, Poland) is a Polish-Paraguayan businessman. He is the founder of the Union of Polish Associations and Organizations in Latin America (pol. "Unia Stowarzyszeń i Organizacji Polskich w Ameryce Łacińskiej, USOPAŁ") the largest Polish immigrant organization of South America. He was a founder of one of the world's largest companies involved in editing postage stamps, and coins mintage. He has written books on philately, as well as on the mediation policy of the Roman Curia. He was formerly the honorary consul of Poland to Paraguay, and the honorary consul of Paraguay to Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.
Biography.
Kobylański was the son of Polish attorney at law Stanisław Kobylański. In 1943 he was arrested by the Nazis, and imprisoned at Warsaw's infamous Pawiak prison. He was a prisoner in the German concentration camps Mauthausen and Gross Rosen. After the World War II, he moved to Italy, where he produced toothbrushes, and sold kitchen appliances. He became co-owner of the "Astral Metal Technica" company in Milan.
In 1952, he arrived in Paraguay, taking advantage of President Federico Chaves' immigration program, which allowed 18,000 families from Europe to settle in that country. Soon he won a contract to import kitchen appliances, and another to print postage stamps for the National Postal Service. In the next few years, he developed one of the world's largest stamp printing and coin minting companies.
According to Polish journalists Jerzy Morawski and Mikołaj Lizut, Kobylański had a good relationship with Paraguayan president, General Alfredo Stroessner. Kobylański, however, denies this.
From 1989 to 2000, Kobylański was an honorary Polish consul in Argentina. He was removed from office by Polish minister of foreign affairs Władysław Bartoszewski, after former Polish ambassadors to Uruguay and Costa Rica accused Kobylański of antisemitism and of acting against Polish interests Right wing Polish senators Jan Szafraniec, Ryszard Bender and Czesław Ryszka have since spoken up in his defence. He is a longtime sponsor of privately owned broadcast station Radio Maryja in Poland.
Kobylański helped to establish 8 June as the "Day of the Polish Settler in Argentina". He helped to fund monuments to John Paul II in Buenos Aires and Montevideo, as well as a monument to Frédéric Chopin in Punta del Este. He is a sponsor and patron of an elementary school in the region of Podlasie in Poland.
Awards.
In 1995 Kobylański was awarded with the Krzyż Oświęcimski.
Accusations.
In 2004, a reporter for "Gazeta Wyborcza", Mikołaj Lizut, accused Kobylański of collaborating with the Nazis when Poland was occupied by German forces during World War II, which Kobylański denies. In 2005, the allegations were repeated by a columnist for "Rzeczpospolita", Jerzy Morawski. In 2004, the investigative section of the Instytut Pamięci Narodowej (IPN) began legal proceedings to determine if the accusations of handling over a Jewish family named Szenker to the Gestapo were true. A person named "Janusz Kobylański" was supposedly involved.
In April 2006 the chief of the investigative section of the IPN, Witold Kulesza, reported: "so far, we have not found any evidence of the charges that... Jan Kobylański, handed over to the Germans a married Jewish couple."
In January 2007, the section of IPN in Warsaw reported that it had refused to re-open the investigation. In his explanation, the leading prosecutor recalled the testimonies of witnesses who decided not to testify against Kobylański: 
In the winter of 1942-1943 Leokadia Sarnowska met Janusz Kobylański(...) During the conversation Janusz Kobylański said, that he was earning money producing false documents for Jews trying to hide themselves. Sarnowska soon sent the Szenker family to Kobylański, which consisted of three people - a married couple and their relative (...) Leokadia Sarnowska arranged the meeting of the two parties, during which Janusz Kobylański told Sarnowska and the Szenkers that false identity documents would be delivered for a certain sum of dollars in gold. The money was delivered to Judge Stanisław Juński, known to Sarnowska, who promised to give them to Kobylański after he delivered the money. Some days after the meeting Kobylański called Sarnowska and said, that the Szenker family had been arrested, and probably executed by the Germans, so he had to destroy the false documents that he had prepared.
Kobylański informed Sarnowska that Judge Juński, on the request of one of Szenkers, handed the money over to a "Polish policeman". Then Kobylański demanded payment from Sarnowska under threat of calling the Germans. Sarnowską delivered a part of the sum to Kobylański at once, and the second part was sent to an office of the father of Janusz Kobylański, att. Stanisław Kobylański (...) After some time one of the Szenker family called Judge Juński, and asked to arrange a meeting with Sarnowska, who immediately came to Warsaw to meet Szenker. Szenker told her that Kobylański denounced them to the Gestapo. According to his version, Gestapo officers went to the hostel where he stayed with his family, and showed him his personal notes, which he handed to Kobylański, hoping that it would help in the preparation of false documents. The Gestapo men ordered a Polish policeman to escort the Szenkers to the ghetto. On their way, Szenker convinced the policeman that he should free them for the money held in the judge's office. Policeman took the money from Juński and freed the Szenkers.
Stanisław Kobylański worked in Warsaw as a lawyer for the remainder of his life. Jan Kobylański, however, escaped from Poland to Western Europe, probably in 1945.
According to documents collected by the Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw, the evidence that Jan Kobylański was the perpetrator in the denunciation of the Szenkers family cannot be proved. Legal proceedings against Stanisław Kobylański were denied, and those against Janusz Kobylański were suspended by the Regional Court in Warsaw on 31 June 1948. On April 19, 1955, prosecutors decided to cancel the case of Janusz Kobylański. Prosecutor Paweł Karolak of the IPN investigative section in Warsaw stated that his office was looking for evidence not only in Poland (archives, Museum of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs), but also in Germany (KL Gross-Rosen), Israel, and the USA as well. Furthermore, they found no evidence that "Janusz Kobylański" and "Jan Kobylański" were the same person.
In 2005, Mikołaj Lizut wrote in the "Gazeta Wyborcza" that Jan Kobylański falsified documents of the Red Cross, that he was a prisoner at Auschwitz, Mauthausen, Gusen, Gross Rosen, and Dachau concentration camps. Documents used by Kobylański, are different from those in the Auschwitz Museum.
In December 2007, the minister of Foreign Affairs, Radosław Sikorski, sent a message to Polish embassies abroad to discontinue contact with Kobylański. In late November 2008, two independent internet services reported that Kobylański was going to open a legal case against Polish politicians and journalists (among others against Adam Michnik, Jerzy Baczyński and Ryszard Schnepf) on charges of slander.

__NOTOC__
The Macchi M.16 was a light, single-seat aircraft produced in Italy in 1919. It was a single-bay biplane with unstaggered wings and a largely conventional design except for an unusually deep fuselage that extended in a bulge below the lower wing. 
The M.16 proved a successful sporting type, setting an altitude record of 3,770 m (12,370 ft) in 1920 while competing for the Coppa Mappelli, and winning first prize in the competition the following year.
Three pontoon-equipped examples were purchased by the United States Navy for evaluation as communication aircraft.

Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn

Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469 (1975) was a United States Supreme Court case involving freedom of the press. The Court held that both a Georgia Statute prohibiting the release of a rape victim's name and its common-law privacy action counterpart were unconstitutional. The case was argued on November 11, 1974 and decided on March 3, 1975.
Procedural History.
In 1971, Cynthia Leslie Cohn, a 17-year-old Potter Stewart High School student, was sexually assaulted at a party and later died in Sandy Springs, Georgia, although it is unclear whether her death was the result of alcohol poisoning or murder. Six boys were initially charged with her murder and rape, although the trial judge would later drop the murder charge. Ultimately, the defendants pleaded guilty to rape. Due to the graphic nature of the crime, the media immediately jumped on the story and began following the proceedings. Thomas Wassell, a reporter for WSB-TV, approached the clerk in open court during the court proceedings in 1972 and asked for a copy of the indictment documents, which contained the name of the victim. He obtained the name and broadcast it later that night while reporting on the defendant's sentencing hearing.
Martin Cohn, the father of Leslie, sued both WSB and its reporter for publishing his daughter's name. He claimed the publication violated both Georgia's shield law and his common-law right to privacy. The trial court granted summary judgement to Cohn on both claims while rejecting Cox's 1st Amendment defense.
On appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court dismissed Cohn's claim under the Shield Law, claiming it created only a criminal, not civil cause of action. However, it allowed Cohn's common-law privacy claim to stand. It rejected Cox's claims that the disclosure of the a rape victim's name was protected by the First Amendment, and compared the activity to other unprotected activities such as fraud, perjury, libel, and slander. Upon rehearing, it also ruled that the Shield Law, and by implicit extension its interpretation of common-law right to privacy, was a "legitimate limitation on the right of freedom of expression contained in the First Amendment[]" and "here simply is no public interest or general concern about the identity of the victim of such a crime as will make the right to disclose the identity of the victim rise to the level of First Amendment protection." It reversed the trial court's summary judgment on the right to privacy claim, and remanded the case back to the trial court to determine if Cox had intentionally invaded Cohn's privacy. Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 200 SE 2d 127 - Georgia Supreme Court 1973.
Before the case could further proceed at the State trial court, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Cox's appeal. The Court reasoned it had jurisdiction since Georgia's Supreme Court's ruling satisfied the finality requirement as it related to Federal Issues. Also, if unreviewed, the decision was likely to harm the freedom of the press regardless of the outcome of the state court trial.
Decision of the Court.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 8−1 in favor of Cox Broadcasting, holding Georgia's Shield Law and its common-law counterpart violated the First Amendment. The majority held "he freedom of the press to publish that information appears to us to be of critical importance to our type of government in which the citizenry is the final judge of the proper conduct of public business. In preserving that form of government the First and Fourteenth Amendments command nothing less than that the States may not impose sanctions on the publication of truthful information contained in official court records open to public inspection." Since Cox, through its reporter, had legitimately obtained the name in open court, the later publication of the name was held to be an activity protected by the 1st Amendment.
Dissent.
In his dissent, Justice Rehnquist argued the Court should not have heard the case because it lacked jurisdiction. Instead of waiting until the case finished in state court, "the Court construes § 1257 so that it may virtually rush out and meet the prospective constitutional litigant as he approaches our doors." He did not address the substantive First Amendment issues.

Rita Rocks is a Lifetime original sitcom that ran from October 20, 2008 to December 7, 2009. It is the network's first original comedy in over a decade. The series debuted alongside re-runs of "Reba" as part of a new comedy hour for Tuesday nights, which later changed to Monday nights. The show stars Nicole Sullivan as Rita, Tisha Campbell-Martin, Richard Ruccolo, Raviv Ullman, and Kelly Gould.
On January 11, 2010, Lifetime cancelled the series after two seasons due to low ratings.
Plot.
A hard-working mom and wife splits her time between a job she doesn’t particularly like, running the kids around and managing the household. She believes that if she can just get a few hours a week to herself, she can figure a few things out. After finding her old guitar in the garage and the prompting of a new friend, they start up a weekly jam session and are joined by a neighbor, the mail-woman and her daughter’s boyfriend for nightly rehearsals. The plot is set in the Metropolitan Detroit area, most likely the Southfield area as Shannon attends Southfield Elementary School, which is shown throughout season 1.
In a February 2009 interview on "Anytime with Bob Kushell", Sullivan agreed the main character is going through a midlife crisis, but she does not like using the term "midlife". 
DVD release.
"Rita Rocks: The Complete 1st Season" was released on a 3-disc combo pack on April 27, 2010.

Miller v. National Broadcasting Co.

Miller v. National Broadcasting Co. 232 Cal. Rptr 668 (1986) is a US tort law case on negligent infliction of emotional distress.
Background.
On October 30, 1979 an NBC camera crew was following a group of Los Angeles Fire Department firefighters and paramedics. A call came in about a man having a heart attack. The camera crew and the paramedics rushed to the home of Brownie and Dave Miller. The camera crew, without consent from anyone, rushed into the house with the paramedics and taped footage of Mr. Dave Miller having what would be a fatal heart attack. The crew later that night would put the footage on the air, also without consent. Brownie Miller filed suit against NBC, Ruben Norte (a producer for NBC) and the city of Los Angeles for trespass, invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress.
Legal Issue.
Does the media, even though they obtain consent from the group they are following (Police, firefighters, paramedics, etc.) have the same access privileges as the police of paramedics do if they are following them on scene?
Decision.
The Court ruled, ultimately, in favor of the plaintiff on the charges of Invasion of Privacy and infliction of Emotional Distress.
Reasoning.
“One seeking emergency medical attention does not thereby “open the door” for persons without any clearly identifiable and justifiable official reason who may wish to enter the premises where the medical aid is being administered…the clear line of demarcation between the public interest served by public officials and that served by private business must not be obscured.”
Disposition.
Reversed- The California Courts of Appeal reversed the summary judgment of the District Court in favor of the defendants and ruled in favor of Brownie Miller.

White Faced Lady

White Faced Lady is an album by UK band Kaleidoscope (who by this time were calling themselves Fairfield Parlour). It is a concept album that tells the story of a pale-skinned girl named Angel, from her troubled youth to her sudden rise to fame as a movie star to her tragic decline and untimely death. Reportedly, it was inspired by the life of Marilyn Monroe, and indeed the final track name-checks Marilyn and Arthur Miller. As a rock opera, it follows the example of The Pretty Things' "S. F. Sorrow" rather than The Who's "Tommy", with the liner notes telling the complete story and the songs expounding on key events. Many of the songs are tied together by brief musical segues.
The band worked on the album privately from 1970 to 1971. They had a deal in place to deliver the finished album to a record label for distribution, but the deal suddenly dissolved. The album went unreleased until 1991, when it was released by the band's own "The Kaleidoscope Record Company" (KRC 001 CD). Many subsequent CD releases package the album with the previous Fairfield Parlour album From Home to Home.
With a total length of 1 hour 9 minutes, it would have been a double-LP.

Characters and story.
The main characters in "Edge City" are the members of the Ardin family. The Ardins are Jewish, and the strip generally features the characters celebrating Passover and Hanukkah at those times of year. Len Ardin is the co-owner of a courier service, and Abby is a therapist. Their children, Colin and Carly, are both elementary school students. "Edge City" (e.g., a community outside the boundaries of what people traditionally think of as the city and its suburb) looks at modern family life. Dwelling in the far reaches of suburbia, Len and Abby lead a life very different from the one they lived growing up. Between managing their careers and taking care of their kids, they barely have time to wave to each other as they hurry off to yet another meeting, carpool or errand. And while their neighborhood is incredibly diverse, it seems like everyone, no matter where they're originally from, lives pretty much the same way. Terry LaBan offered this description of the strip:

Harry Schafer

Harry C. Schafer (August 14, 1846 – February 28, 1935) was a professional baseball player who played for eight seasons in Major League Baseball. He played for the Boston Red Stockings in the National Association for five seasons, and remained with the franchise for three additional years when it joined the National League in 1876 as the Boston Red Caps. He played third base for much of his career.
Career.
In the National Association, Schafer was a durable player who played in every game in the Red Stockings' first four seasons, earning at least a share of the league lead in games played in 1873 and 1874. Schafer hit .288 in 1872, and had an above average fielding percentage. He was a member of the Red Stockings teams that won four consecutive National Association championships from 1872 to 1875.
While playing for the renamed Red Caps in 1876, the first year of the National League, Schafer again led the league in games played. He played in only half of the Red Caps' games in 1877, and was moved to right field for the season, but was nevertheless part of a team that won the National League championship. In his final season, 1878, he played in only two games for a Red Caps team that won a second consecutive league championship. Schafer had a career batting average of .271, and was a part of six championship teams in his eight seasons in the majors.
According to the "Sporting News"'s 2008 "Complete Baseball Record Book", he is credited with recording four outfield assists in an 1877 game, a National League record. The accuracy of this record has been called into question by statisticians. Modern sources, including those on the official website of Major League Baseball, only credit Schafer with a single outfield assist for the 1877 season and four outfield assists for his entire career.
Schafer died on February 28, 1935 at the age of 88 in Philadelphia.

Macchi M.18

__NOTOC__
The Macchi M.18 was a flying boat produced in Italy in the early 1920s. Originally planned as a passenger aircraft, it entered production as a bomber before eventually being offered on the civil market that it was originally intended for. A conventional design for World War I, it was a biplane flying boat with unstaggered wings of unequal span braced by Warren truss-style struts. The engine was mounted pusher-fashion in the interplane gap, and the pilot and observer sat in side-by-side open cockpits. An open position was provided in the bow for a gunner.
In addition to the standard military version, a version with folding wings was produced for shipboard use as the M.18AR. This equipped the Italian Navy's seaplane tender "Giuseppe Miraglia" and the Spanish Navy's "Dédalo". The latter service used the type in action against Moroccan rebels. Six of the 20 machines purchased by Spain remained in service at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and were used to attack Nationalist forces on Majorca as well as flying reconnaissance patrols. Portugal also operated the type, buying eight examples in 1928.
The Paraguayan government bought two Macchi M.18AR in the late 1932 for the Naval Aviation. They received the serials R.3 and R.5 and were intensively used in the Chaco War (1932-1935). Both fulfilled many reconnaissance and bombing missions in the North Front during the war. The first aerial night bombing was done by R.5 on December 22, 1934. R.3 was destroyed in an accident at the end of the war and R.5 was in service until the mid-1940s.
Three civil versions were eventually produced. The first of these, the M.18 "Economico" ("Commercial"), was generally similar to the military version, but was followed by the M.18 "Lusso" ("Luxury") which featured an enclosed cabin. The M.18 "Estivo" ("Summertime") again reverted to open cockpits. Some 70 civil examples were produced in all, some being purchased by joyriding firms such as "Ad Astra Aero" in Switzerland and some others being used by SISA for training flying boat pilots for airline service in the Adriatic.

Donald Cock

Donald James Cock (10 July 1896 – August 1974) was an English football player. He was the younger brother of England international Jack Cock.
Born in Hayle, Cornwall, Cock started his professional career with Brentford during World War I. A striker, he moved to Fulham in 1919. In three seasons with the Second Division club, he averaged a goal every other game, and was the club's leading goalscorer in 1919–20 and 1920–21. He moved to Notts County in October 1922 and played nearly 100 games in three seasons there, being the club's top scorer in 1922–23 and 1923–24, winning the Second Division title in the former.
Cock's exploits at Notts County earned the eye of Arsenal and he was signed by Leslie Knighton in March 1925, making his debut for Arsenal against Bolton Wanderers on 7 March 1925. However, in his next match, against his former club Notts County at Meadow Lane, he was tackled strongly and broke his leg. He was out of action for five months and could not find favour under new manager Herbert Chapman. Cock only played one more game for Arsenal before being sold to Clapton Orient in October 1925.
Cock regained his form at Orient, becoming top scorer for the Second Division side in 1925–26 and 1926–27 before finishing his career with brief stints at Wolves and Newport County in 1927. He retired from professional football, aged 31, soon after. He died in 1974, aged 78.

<doc id="19852565" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19852565" title="Medical Council (Ireland)">
Medical Council (Ireland)

The Medical Council () is the regulator of the medical profession in Ireland. It maintains the register of medical practitioners to practise, and has the power to place restrictions on or revoke such licences, in cases of questions about a doctor's fitness to practise. The president of the Council is Professor Freddie Wood, and its chief executive officer is Ms Caroline Spillane.
The objective of the Medical Council is to protect the public by promoting and better ensuring high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registered medical practitioners.
History.
The Council was established by the Medical Practitioners Act 1978 and commenced operation in April 1979. It replaced an earlier body, the Medical Registration Council, which had been established under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 1927, and which took over certain functions from the General Medical Council (the medical regulator for the United Kingdom).
Purpose.
The principal functions of the Medical Council include:
Services of public interest.
Managing the register of doctors
The Council provides the public with a searchable database of registered doctors. It is here where the public is able to verify that their doctor is registered to practise medicine in Ireland as well as checking their qualifications and registration status.
Lifelong learning and skills development
In May 2011, the Medical Council introduced requirements for all registered doctors to maintain their professional competence. This means that it is now a legal duty to engage in formal arrangements for lifelong learning and skills development, and the Council oversees doctors to ensure that they fulfil this duty.
Handling complaints
Anyone can make a complaint against a doctor to the Medical Council. The Council then begins the formal complaint procedure by forwarding it to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee of the Medical Council, which considers each and every complaint made to the Council. 
After the Committee receives enough information about the complaint it then decides whether to take further action. If so, the complaint will be referred to the Fitness to Practise Committee for a Fitness to Practise inquiry. Alternatively, the Council could decide to take no further action, refer the complaint to another body or authority, or for mediation, or could refer the doctor for a performance assessment.
Setting ethical standards
The Medical Council gives guidance on all matters related to professional conduct and ethics for registered doctors.
About the Medical Council.
The Council consists of 25 members and includes both elected and appointed members. Under the provisions of the "Medical Practitioners Act, 2007", the new Council is composed of 13 non-medical members and 12 medical members representing a range of medical specialties, teaching bodies and members of the public and stakeholders. All appointments must be approved by the Minister for Health. The current Council's period of office is 2013 to 2018.
The Medical Council is required by law to establish an Education and Training Committee (known as the Professional Development Committee), a Preliminary Proceedings Committee, a Fitness to Practise Committee and a Health Sub-committee. Only members of the Medical Council may be eligible to Chair the Fitness to Practise Committee and the Preliminary Proceedings Committee. The Council may establish as many committees as it considers necessary to carry out specific functions.
Administration.
On 15 June 2009, the Medical Council took up residence in a new premises in Kingram House, Kingram Place, Dublin 2. Kingram House, located just off Fitzwilliam Square, is a singularly distinctive building characterised by its odd blend of Georgian and contemporary architecture. Front-of-house, a two-story listed building, was once home to an infant school and links directly on to a modern office suite.
The Medical Council has a staff of over 50 who work in three directorates (Professional Development and Practice, Regulation and Finance and Administration) reporting to the chief executive officer. The Council's communications function sits within the CEO's office. The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 sets out the functions of the CEO and Committees of the Council. It also specifies functions reserved for the Minister for Health and Children, such as agreement to the creation of new specialties. The Act gives the CEO an independent responsibility to present disciplinary inquiries to the Fitness to Practise Committee, once a decision has been made that a prima facie case exists for an enquiry. To carry out this function, the CEO is empowered to collect evidence and employ legal representatives to present the case.
The council is funded exclusively by the annual payments of registered medical practitioners; no funds are received from the government exchequer or other external sources. The annual retention fee for a fully registered medical practitioner was set at €490 in 2012.
According to the Medical Council's 2011 Annual Report, there were 18,812 medical practitioners, including various registration categories, registered with the Medical Council.
There were 380 new complaints against doctors received in 2011, a five percent increase. Of these new complaints, 15 doctors received sanctions and six doctors had conditions imposed on them. Eight doctors were struck off the register.
In 2011, the Medical Council inspected 6 medical schools and 38 clinical sites. The Medical Council is responsible for setting and monitoring standards for undergraduate education and training in Ireland. This is done by establishing standards and producing guidelines on medical curriculum, content, student conduct and behaviour. The Council may fully approve, conditionally approve or refuse to approve medical schools or programmes.
"“The key role of the medical council is protection of the public but We also have a role in further enhancing the relationship of trust that exists between a doctor and a patient. And one of the key ways that we do this is by setting and monitoring standards for a doctor’s conduct, for their education, for their training and their ongoing professional competence so that we ensure a high standard of doctor operates within the Irish health service”." "– CEO of the Medical Council – Ms Caroline Spillane on the CEO’s Review"

Livadochori, Lemnos

Livadochori () is a village and a community in the Greek island of Lemnos, part of the municipal unit Nea Koutali. In 2001 its population was 210 for the village, and 474 for the community, which includes the village Poliochni. It is situated in the central part of the island, 1 km northwest of Kallithea, 2 km north of Nea Koutali, 7 km northwest of Moudros and 12 km northeast of Myrina. The Lemnos International Airport is 3 km east.
History.
Under the name Livadochorion or Livatochorion it was first mentioned in 1355 in a document of the Philotheou monastery, Mount Athos. Since then it has repeatedly been mentioned under the same name in maps (including Buondelmonti's map in 1418) and books, suggesting continuous existence of the village. During the years under Turkish rule, it was one of the main villages on the island. It was populated by Greeks and Ottoman agas who supervised their agricultural estates. In 1548, when Belon visited the island, the village was fortified and the seat of the voivode of the island. The revolutionary leaders Pantelis Marinakis and Apostolis Limnios came from the village, and took part in the battles in Arcadia and Niokastro in 1824 and 1825 under Vasos Mavrovouniotis. 
When the German archaeologist Conze visited the village in 1858, it was still a large village that was partly ruined. At that time Greek shipowners and immigrants began to buy the Ottoman estates and the Ottoman landowners began to settle in the capital Kastro. According to the communal archives from 1854, the village had 62 enlisted men that paid 989 piastres to avoid conscription. It had 45 Christian families in 1863 and 55 in 1874, it had 59 houses in the same year. The village was part of the municipality (koli) of Kontias and its inhabitantas sent a representative to the Lemnos provincial assembly.
A school was founded by Doukas Palaiologos in nearby Sarpi in 1868. In 1894 a school was established in Livadochori. In 1910 a dedicated school building was built by Egyptian-Greeks Sarantis and Palaiologos from Kornos and the school was community-run. It ran up to the 1980s and closed due to a student population decline.
After Livadochori and the island joined the rest of Greece as a result of the Balkan Wars, it became an independent community in 1918, in which it was united for some years with the settlements of Strati (repealed in 1928) and Kourouni (since 1940 a part of the community of Lera).
In the years between the two World Wars, the village saw a small growth. It built an aqueduct and a fountain in 1922, donated for 200,000 drachmas by the brothers Nikolaos and Komninos Halamandaris. It had 516 inhabitantas in 1928, among whom were many refugees from Minor Asia, employed mainly in the agriculture and animal husbandry. In its fields, it produced 480,000 tons of wheat and 30,000 tons of cotton. It had a flour mill and a cotton factory.
After the Second World War, the village declined dramatically due to emigration. It had 604 inhabitants in 1951, it fell to 266 in 1981 (of which 63 were inhabitants of neighboring Poliochni). Together with Poliochni, Livadochori had 474 inhabitants in 2001. 
Despite the depopulation, it is still a lively and pretty village. In 1989, the Livadochori High school was opened which serves students from central Lemnos.
Poliochni.
Poliochni is a village on a low hill northeast of Livadochori. It takes its name from this hill, and is not related to the archaeological site Poliochne in eastern Lemnos. In the Middle Ages, a village called "Agiopavlitiko" was situated on the site of present Poliochni. In a document dated 1796, this village was mentioned under the name "Ligkouli" or "Likoli". By then, it was already abandoned and ruined. In 1881 the place was mentioned as "Polichni", which was changed into "Poliochni" after the discovery of ancient Poliochne near Kaminia. It was settled again in the early 20th century, and since in 1981 it is an official settlement of the community Livadochori.

Mickey (TV series)

Mickey is an American situation comedy that aired on ABC from September 1964 to January 1965. Created and produced by Bob Fisher and Arthur Marx, the series stars Mickey Rooney, and was filmed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios.
Synopsis.
Mickey Grady (Mickey Rooney), a retired businessman, inherits the luxury Newport Arms Hotel in Newport Beach, California, and decides to run it.
Awards.
Rooney won a Golden Globe Award for "Best Actor in a Television Series" at the 21st Annual Golden Globe Awards ceremonies in 1964.
Notable guest stars.
Rooney said he would have liked Judy Garland to guest star.
Reception and cancellation.
The series failed to sustain ratings to survive the full season in its 9 p.m. Eastern time slot on Wednesdays. Its principal competition was another sitcom, "The Dick Van Dyke Show" on CBS. NBC ran television movies at the time. 
Due to low ratings, ABC was considering canceling "Mickey". The network was hesitant to cancel the series due to the popularity of Sammee Tong's character who had a solid fanbase thanks to his role in "Bachelor Father". In his 1991 autobiography, "Life Is Too Short", Mickey Rooney wrote that Tong was upset by the news that the series faced cancellation. Tong, who was a heavy gambler and owed money to the mafia, needed the money from the series to pay off his debts. On October 27, 1964, Tong took an overdose of barbiturates and died at his home. Tong's death effectively ended any chance for the series' survival, and ABC canceled "Mickey". The series' last episode aired on January 13, 1965.

Orthodox Christian Fellowship

Orthodox Christian Fellowship or OCF is the official campus ministry of the Orthodox Episcopal Assembly of North America, and was formerly under the Standing Conference of the Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas (SCOBA). OCF is a Pan-Orthodox campus ministry that supports local OCF chapters. Local chapters are made up of students and young adults within a college or university, or from different colleges and universities in an area. The mission of OCF is to support fellowships on college campuses, whose members experience and witness to the Orthodox Christian Church through community life, prayer, service to others and study of the Faith. OCF was previously headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts but in 2008 it moved to Indianapolis, IN. OCF provides a variety of thoughtful and innovative programming, including regional training, annual conferences, and domestic and international service learning projects to chapters on over 300 university campuses across the U.S. and Canada.
History.
Campus Commission.
OCF has a rich history in North America that spans over fifty years. Following WWII, an Orthodox college student movement began to emerge. Individual campus groups were formed at various universities, including Columbia, McGill, and Penn State. Despite the momentum of this growing movement, there was virtually no interaction between the groups. Then, in the spring of 1965, SCOBA created its first national ministry, the Campus Commission. The purpose of this ministry was to oversee and coordinate these developing local fellowships. 
James Couchell (now Bishop DIMITRIOS of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese) was appointed as the first Executive Director of the Campus Commission. He visited hundreds of campuses, helping to establish and grow local campus chapters. Over 100 chapters developed coast-to-coast during this time. The national programs included a quarterly magazine entitled Concern as well as annual retreats, which gathered at St. Vladimir's Orthodox Seminary and Holy Cross Seminary. These nationwide retreats were the predecessors of what have become the OCF College Conferences. 
In 1971, the exciting growth of campus ministry came to a halt with the reassignment of James Couchell. Shortly after, a new director was appointed, funding from the archdioceses discontinued, and in 1973, the Campus Commission was forced to close its ministry. It's estimated that campus groups dwindled to less than fifty nationwide. Without any coordinated effort, successful campus ministry was inconsistent and sporadic at best. Although, the national organization of the Campus Commission ceased to exist, the spirit and mission of the organization was kept alive by individual chapters across the country.
OCF Today.
In 1997, three former seminarian classmates responsible for their respective jurisdictional campus ministry programs, pledged to work together towards the resurgence of a pan-Orthodox campus ministry. In 2000, Fr. Michael Nasser of the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese, Fr. Mark Leondis of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese and Fr. Michael Andersen of the Orthodox Church in America went before SCOBA and asked for the formal reestablishment of a North American campus ministry. Each jurisdiction was petitioned for appointments. The three initiating members were joined by Natalie Kapeluck, appointed by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA. 
The first official meeting of the new campus ministry of SCOBA was held in South Bound Brook, NJ, at the Archdiocesan Center of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA. The new ministry began a partnership with The Patriarch Athenagoras Orthodox Institute (PAOI) based at the University of Berkeley. The PAOI provided OCF with space for its first office and aided in providing a part-time employee.
Over the next two years, the members of the board worked to establish the framework of what is now called Orthodox Christian Fellowship, shedding its name of Campus Commission. They created a website, an online directory, the Real Break program, a short-term missions program, a student newsletter, and the College Conference program.
Looking to take the ministry to the next step, the Board hired a full-time administrator during the summer of 2002 and moved the North American office to the campus of Hellenic College/Holy Cross in Brookline, MA. At the same time, OCF received a portion of a Lilly Endowment grant awarded to Hellenic College for the Theological Exploration of Vocation. This five-year scaling grant enabled OCF to build an infrastructure, hire staff, and expand its programs. In 2008, OCF moved its headquarters to Indianapolis, IN, and hired additional staff to oversee the three-year sustainability grant awarded by Lilly to explore Christian vocation in the context of service to the poor.
In 2010, OCF celebrates its tenth anniversary of being reinstated.

Larisa Petrik

Larisa Leonidovna Petrik (; born 28 August 1949) is a former Soviet gymnast and Olympic champion.
Petrik competed at the 1966 World Championships where she shared in the team silver medal (gold went to the Czechoslovakians) and earned an individual bronze medal on the beam.
She also competed at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, where she received a gold medal in floor exercise (shared with Věra Čáslavská), a gold medal in team combined exercises, and a bronze medal in balance beam. Her gold medal on floor was very controversial because originally, Čáslavská won outright. After the competition was concluded, Petrik's prelims scores were changed to let her tie with Čáslavská, an action which caused Čáslavská to publicly defy the Soviets who had recently invaded her home country.
After marrying the Olympic gymnast Viktor Klimenko she changed her last name to Klimenko (). She has two sons: Vladimir and Viktor; Vladimir is a gymnast and Viktor is a ballet dancer.

Laurence Leamer

Laurence Leamer (born October 30, 1941) is a best-selling author and journalist. Leamer is a former Ford Fellow in International Development at the University of Oregon and a former International Fellow at Columbia University. He is regarded as an expert on the Kennedy family and has appeared in numerous media outlets discussing American politics. Leamer has also written best-selling biographies of other American icons, including Johnny Carson, the Reagan family, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Biography.
Leamer was born in Chicago and later moved to upstate New York with his family where he attended Vestal Central High School. He attended Antioch College where he spent a year in France, studied at the Université de Besançon, and worked in a factory. He received his B.A. in History from Antioch in 1964. After his graduation, Leamer joined the Peace Corps and was stationed in the mountains of Nepal. When he returned home, Leamer studied both at the University of Oregon and the prestigious Columbia University School of Journalism, where he graduated second in his class in 1969 while being named a Pulitzer International Fellow.
After finishing at Columbia, Leamer worked as an associate editor at "Newsweek" before turning to writing magazine articles for a range of publications, including "Harper's", "The New York Times Magazine", and "Playboy". During this period, Leamer worked in a coal mine in West Virginia, while researching an article. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he was the only journalist to live in a Bengali hotel in Dacca and travel to remote areas of the newborn Bangladesh. His article in "Harper's" won a citation from the Overseas Press Club for "Best Magazine Reporting".
Work.
Leamer is widely regarded as an expert on the Kennedy family due to his exhaustive trilogy on the family, of which "The Kennedy Women" was the main selection of the Book of the Month Club and reached number two on the "New York Times" Best Seller list. His other two books on the Kennedys, "The Kennedy Men" and "Sons of Camelot" were equally well received. He has often been interviewed by NBC Nightly News, "The New York Times", CNN and NPR to lend his expertise to matters concerning the Kennedys, Ronald Reagan, and American politics. In the period following the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr., Leamer served as the on-air consultant for MSNBC's coverage of the plane crash and subsequent funeral. He again served as a consultant during the coverage of former President Ronald Reagan's funeral.
Leamer has not limited himself to covering only the Kennedys, as several of his other books have graced best-seller lists, including his biography of Johnny Carson, "King of the Night", which spent over 6 weeks on the "New York Times" Best Seller list. In writing his novel, "Assignment", Leamer lived in Peru for two years to research the cocaine trade. He again immersed himself in his topic when he moved to Nashville to research the business and lifestyle of country music and its many stars for "Three Chords and the Truth". Each of the books were lauded for the depth of their research. Leamer also briefly flirted with movie fame when his work on the life of famed mountaineer Willi Unsoeld was purchased by Robert Redford's production company to be turned into a film. The film remains in the development stages. His newest project is "The Price of Justice", a book about two Pittsburgh lawyers and their decade and a half struggle against the most powerful coal baron in American history. It involves allegations concerning the deaths of thirty-one miners, the poisoning of the water of hundreds of people, and of judicial corruption in the West Virginia Supreme court and a landmark decision in the United States Supreme Court.
Personal life.
Leamer is married to Vesna Obradovic, who assists him with the research for his books. The author has one daughter, Daniela, and two grandchildren. The couple maintain residences in Palm Beach, Florida and Washington, D.C. Leamer's brother, Edward, is an economics professor at UCLA, the Chauncey J. Medberry Chair in Management, and director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast. His other brother, Robert, is an attorney and executive vice president of a leading hospital group in New York City.

The Winds of Darkover

The Winds of Darkover is a science fiction fantasy novel by Marion Zimmer Bradley in her Darkover series. It was first published by Ace Books in 1970, as an Ace Double bound tête-bêche with "The Anything Tree" by John Rackham. 
This is the first Darkover novel to include references to the Sharra Matrix. In terms of the Darkover timeline, Bradley states in "Author's Notes on Chronology" that "The Winds of Darkover" occurs about four years after the events in Star of Danger.
One the underlying themes of "The Winds of Darkover" is rape. Bradley provides her readers with parallel experiences – the rape of Allira Storn by the bandit Brynat, and the psychic rape of Dan Barron by Loran Storn. Both Allira and Dan are overcome by force and their bodies made to do things they would not have done by choice. In both cases, the perpetrators justify their actions on the basis of need – Brynat needs to marry Allira to legitimize his sack of Storn, and Loran Storn needs to protect Storn Castle. The reader is left to consider the consequences. 
Plot Summary.
Dan Barron, a Terran spaceport technician, has begun having visions that interfere with his work. After he causes a major accident, Barron is reassigned to a minor diplomatic mission to teach lens griding to the locals. His guide is Lerrys Montray, who unbeknownst to Barron, is half Terran.
In the Hellers Mountains, the isolated Storn family estate of High Windward has come under attack from a bandit colorfully named Brynat Scarface. He has forced one of the Storn daughters to marry him, but is unable to take full control of the castle because the Lord of Storn lies in a trance behind a telepathic force field. 
Storn has made telepathic contact with both Barron, causing his visions, and his sister Melitta, and instructs them both to rendesvous at the ancient city of Carthon. While escaping the castle, Melitta calls on the assistance of Sharra, the mythical chained goddess of forges and fires. 
Barron, Lerrys, and their party make their way to one of the mountain fire stations. On the trail, Barron also has a vision of Sharra. Now merged with Storn, he recognizes the beginnings of a Ghost Wind, which disorients all who come in contact. The party takes shelter, but Barron uses the opportunity to escape to Carthon. 
Barron and Melitta meet, and Melitta realizes that her brother has taken over Barron’s mind. They make their way to Aldaran to request assistance. They are welcomed by Desideria Leynier, and later meet with Kermiac Aldaran. Alderan refuses to support their cause, but Desideria suggests she can use the Sharra Matrix on their behalf. Barron is accidentally exposed to a telepathic damper, separating him from Storn.
Desideria, Barron and Melitta return to the Storn lands. With the assistance of the mysterious Forge Folk, Desideria uses Sharra to destroy the bandits. Barron decides to remain with Melitta.

Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History

The Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History (later renamed to Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History) was an academic research organization at Brigham Young University (BYU) from 1980 to 2005 that sought to promote the study of the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
History.
In 1982, the History Division of the church's Historical Department was dissolved and its staff transferred to BYU, to become part of the Smith Institute. Leonard J. Arrington, who headed the History Division from 1972–1982, also led the Smith Institute from 1980-1986. Arrington was succeeded as head of the institute by Ron Esplin. Esplin was succeeded by Jill Mulvay Derr. 
The Smith Institute operated as part of BYU's College of Family, Home and Social Sciences.
In 2005, with the growth of the Joseph Smith Papers Project, and with its relocation to the Family and Church History Department in Salt Lake City, it was decided to dissolve the institute and have various academic departments at BYU continue research in church history topics. Some of the former faculty members of the institute, such as Grant Underwood were transferred to BYU's history department.
Controversies.
In 2003 in response to Grant Palmer's book in which he gave the impression that at least some of the scholars at the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute supported his views on church history, the Smith Institute issued a statement directly rejecting the views advanced by Palmer.

Introduction to evolution

Evolution is the process of change in all forms of life over generations, and evolutionary biology is the study of how evolution occurs. Life evolves by means of mutations (changes in an organism's hereditary information), genetic drift (random change in the genetic variation of a population from generation to generation), and natural selection (the non-random and gradual process of natural variation by which observable traits (such as eye color) become more or less common in a population).
All individuals have hereditary material in the form of genes that are received from their parents, then passed on to their offspring. Among offspring there are variations of genes due to the introduction of new genes via random changes called mutations or via reshuffling of existing genes during sexual reproduction. The offspring differs from the parent in minor random ways. If those differences are helpful, the offspring is more likely to survive and reproduce. This means that more offspring in the next generation will have that helpful difference and individuals will not have equal chances of reproductive success. In this way, traits that result in organisms being better adapted to their living conditions become more common in descendant populations. These differences accumulate resulting in changes within the population. This process is responsible for the many diverse life forms in the world.
The forces of evolution are most evident when populations become isolated, either through geographic distance or by other mechanisms that prevent genetic exchange. Over time, isolated populations can branch off into new species.
The majority of genetic mutations neither assist, change the appearance of, nor bring harm to individuals. Through the process of genetic drift, these mutated genes are neutrally sorted among populations and survive across generations by chance alone. In contrast to genetic drift, natural selection is not a random process because it acts on traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction. Natural selection and random genetic drift are constant and dynamic parts of life and over time this has shaped the branching structure in the tree of life.
The modern understanding of evolution began with the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species". In addition, Gregor Mendel's work with plants helped to explain the hereditary patterns of genetics. Fossil discoveries in paleontology, advances in population genetics and a global network of scientific research have provided further details into the mechanisms of evolution. Scientists now have a good understanding of the origin of new species (speciation) and have observed the speciation process in the laboratory and in the wild. Evolution is the principal theory that biologists use to understand life and is used in many disciplines, including medicine, psychology, conservation biology, anthropology, forensics, agriculture and other social-cultural applications.
Natural selection.
In the 19th century, natural history collections and museums were a popular pastime. The European expansion and naval expeditions employed naturalists and curators of grand museums showcasing preserved and live specimens of the varieties of life. Charles Darwin was an English graduate who was educated and trained in the disciplines of natural history science. Such natural historians would collect, catalogue, describe and study the vast collections of specimens stored and managed by curators at these museums. Charles Darwin served as a ship's naturalist on board the HMS Beagle, assigned to a five-year research expedition around the world. During his voyage, Darwin observed and collected an abundance of organisms, being very interested in the diverse forms of life along the coasts of South America and the neighboring Galapagos Islands.
Charles Darwin gained extensive experience as he collected and studied the natural history of life forms from distant places. Through his studies, Darwin formulated the idea that each species had developed from ancestors with similar features. In 1838, he described how a process he called natural selection would make this happen.
The size of a population depends on how much and how many resources are able to support it. For the population to remain the same size year after year, there must be an equilibrium, or balance between the population size and available resources. Since organisms produce more offspring than their environment can support, not all individuals can survive out of each generation. There must be a competitive struggle for resources that aid in survival. As a result, Darwin realized that it was not chance alone that determined survival. Instead, survival of an organism depends on the differences of each individual organism, or "traits", that aid or hinder survival and reproduction. Well-adapted individuals are likely to leave more offspring than their less well-adapted competitors. Traits that hinder survival and reproduction would "disappear" over generations. Traits that help an organism survive and reproduce would "accumulate" over generations. Darwin realized that the unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce could cause gradual changes in the population and used the term "natural selection" to describe this process.
Observations of variations in animals and plants formed the basis of the theory of natural selection. For example, Darwin observed that orchids and insects have a close relationship that allows the pollination of the plants. He noted that orchids have a variety of structures that attract insects, so that pollen from the flowers gets stuck to the insects’ bodies. In this way, insects transport the pollen from a male to a female orchid. In spite of the elaborate appearance of orchids, these specialized parts are made from the same basic structures that make up other flowers. In his book "Fertilisation of Orchids" Darwin proposed that the orchid flowers were adapted from pre-existing parts, through natural selection.
Darwin was still researching and experimenting with his ideas on natural selection when he received a letter from Alfred Wallace describing a theory very similar to his own. This led to an immediate joint publication of both theories. Both Wallace and Darwin saw the history of life like a family tree, with each fork in the tree’s limbs being a common ancestor. The tips of the limbs represented modern species and the branches represented the common ancestors that are shared amongst many different species. To explain these relationships, Darwin said that all living things were related, and this meant that all life must be descended from a few forms, or even from a single common ancestor. He called this process "descent with modification".
Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in "On the Origin of Species" in 1859. His theory means that all life, including humanity, is a product of continuing natural processes. The implication that all life on Earth has a common ancestor has met with objections from some religious groups. Their objections are in contrast to the level of support for the theory by more than 99 percent of those within the scientific community today.
Natural selection is commonly equated with "survival of the fittest", but this expression originated in Herbert Spencer's "Principles of Biology" in 1864, 5 years after Charles Darwin published his original works. "Survival of the fittest" describes the process of natural selection incorrectly, because natural selection is not only about survival and it is not always the fittest that survives.
Source of variation.
Darwin’s theory of natural selection laid the groundwork for modern evolutionary theory, and his experiments and observations showed that the organisms in populations varied from each other, that some of these variations were inherited, and that these differences could be acted on by natural selection. However, he could not explain the source of these variations. Like many of his predecessors, Darwin mistakenly thought that hereditable traits were a product of use and disuse, and that features acquired during an organism's lifetime could be passed on to its offspring. He looked for examples, such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the ostrich, they could not fly at all. This misunderstanding was called the inheritance of acquired characters and was part of the theory of transmutation of species put forward in 1809 by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. In the late 19th century this theory became known as Lamarckism. Darwin produced an unsuccessful theory he called pangenesis to try to explain how acquired characteristics could be inherited. In the 1880s August Weismann's experiments indicated that changes from use and disuse could not be inherited, and Lamarckism gradually fell from favor.
The missing information needed to help explain how new features could pass from a parent to its offspring was provided by the pioneering genetics work of Gregor Mendel. Mendel’s experiments with several generations of pea plants demonstrated that inheritance works by separating and reshuffling hereditary information during the formation of sex cells and recombining that information during fertilization. This is like mixing different hands of cards, with an organism getting a random mix of half of the cards from one parent, and half of the cards from the other. Mendel called the information "factors"; however, they later became known as genes. Genes are the basic units of heredity in living organisms. They contain the information that directs the physical development and behavior of organisms.
Genes are made of DNA. DNA is a long molecule made up of individual molecules called nucleotides. Genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides, that make up the DNA, just as the sequence of the letters in words carries information on a page. The genes are like short instructions built up of the "letters" of the DNA alphabet. Put together, the entire set of these genes gives enough information to serve as an "instruction manual" of how to build and run an organism. The instructions spelled out by this DNA alphabet can be changed, however, by mutations, and this may alter the instructions carried within the genes. Within the cell, the genes are carried in chromosomes, which are packages for carrying the DNA. It is the reshuffling of the chromosomes that results in unique combinations of genes in offspring. Since genes interact with one another during the development of an organism, novel combinations of genes produced by sexual reproduction can increase the genetic variability of the population even without new mutations. The genetic variability of a population can also increase when members of that population interbreed with individuals from a different population causing gene flow between the populations. This can introduce genes into a population that were not present before.
Evolution is not a random process. Although mutations in DNA are random, natural selection is not a process of chance: the environment determines the probability of reproductive success. Evolution is an inevitable result of imperfectly copying, self-replicating organisms reproducing over billions of years under the selective pressure of the environment. The outcome of evolution is not a perfectly designed organism. The end products of natural selection are organisms that are adapted to their present environments. Natural selection does not involve progress towards an ultimate goal. Evolution does not strive for more advanced, more intelligent, or more sophisticated life forms. For example, fleas (wingless parasites) are descended from a winged, ancestral scorpionfly, and snakes are lizards that no longer require limbs - although pythons still grow tiny structures that are the remains of their ancestor's hind legs. Organisms are merely the outcome of variations that succeed or fail, dependent upon the environmental conditions at the time.
Rapid environmental changes typically cause extinctions. Of all species that have existed on Earth, 99.9 percent are now extinct. Since life began on Earth, five major mass extinctions have led to large and sudden drops in the variety of species. The most recent, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, occurred 66 million years ago.
Genetic drift.
Genetic drift is a cause of allelic frequency change within populations of a species. Alleles are different variations of specific genes. They determine things like hair color, skin tone, eye color and blood type; in other words, all the genetic traits that vary between persons. Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles to a population, but it can reduce variation within a population by removing an allele from the gene pool. Genetic drift is caused by random sampling of alleles. A truly random sample is a sample in which no outside forces affect what is selected. It is like pulling marbles of the same size and weight but of different colors from a brown paper bag. In any offspring, the alleles present are samples of the previous generations alleles, and chance plays a role in whether an individual survives to reproduce and to pass a sample of their generation onward to the next. The allelic frequency of a population is the ratio of the copies of one specific allele that share the same form compared to the number of all forms of the allele present in the population.
Genetic drift affects smaller populations more than it affects larger populations.
Hardy-Weinberg principle.
The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that a large population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium will have no change in the frequency of alleles as generations pass. It is impossible for a population of any considerable size to reach this equilibrium because of the five requirements that must be met. A population must be infinite in size. There must be a zero percent mutation rate between generations, because mutations can alter existing alleles or create new ones. There can be no immigration or emigration in the population, because individuals arriving and leaving directly change allelic frequencies. There can be no selective pressures of any kind on the population, meaning that no individual is more likely than any other to survive and reproduce. Finally, mating must be totally random, with all males (or females in some cases) being equally desirable mates. This ensures a true random mixing of alleles.
A population that is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is analogous to a deck of cards; no matter how many times the deck is shuffled, no new cards are added and no old ones are taken away. Cards in the deck represent alleles in a population’s gene pool.
Population bottleneck.
A population bottleneck occurs when the population of a species is reduced drastically over a short period of time due to external forces. In a true population bottleneck, the reduction does not favor any combination of alleles; it is totally random chance which individuals survive. A bottleneck can reduce or eliminate genetic variation from a population. Further drift events after the bottleneck event can also reduce the population's genetic diversity. The lack of diversity created can make the population at risk to other selective pressures.
A common example of a population bottleneck is the Northern elephant seal. Due to excessive hunting throughout the 19th century, the population of the northern elephant seal was reduced to 30 individuals or less. They have made a full recovery, with the total number of individuals at around 100,000 and growing. The effects of the bottleneck are visible, however. The seals are more likely to have serious problems with disease or genetic disorders, because there is almost no diversity in the population.
Founder effect.
One example of the founder effect is found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two of the founders of the colony in Pennsylvania carried the recessive allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Because the Amish tend to be religious isolates, they interbreed, and through generations of this practice the frequency of Ellis–van Creveld syndrome in the Amish people is much higher than the frequency in the general population.
Modern synthesis.
The modern evolutionary synthesis is based on the concept that populations of organisms have significant genetic variation caused by mutation and by the recombination of genes during sexual reproduction. It defines evolution as the change in allelic frequencies within a population caused by genetic drift, gene flow between sub populations, and natural selection. Natural selection is emphasized as the most important mechanism of evolution; large changes are the result of the gradual accumulation of small changes over long periods of time.
The modern evolutionary synthesis is the outcome of a merger of several different scientific fields to produce a more cohesive understanding of evolutionary theory. In the 1920s, R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright combined Darwin's theory of natural selection with statistical models of Mendelian genetics, founding the discipline of population genetics. In the 1930s and 1940s, efforts were made to merge population genetics, the observations of field naturalists on the distribution of species and sub species, and analysis of the fossil record into a unified explanatory model. The application of the principles of genetics to naturally occurring populations, by scientists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr, advanced the understanding of the processes of evolution. Dobzhansky's 1937 work "Genetics and the Origin of Species" helped bridge the gap between genetics and field biology by presenting the mathematical work of the population geneticists in a form more useful to field biologists, and by showing that wild populations had much more genetic variability with geographically isolated subspecies and reservoirs of genetic diversity in recessive genes than the models of the early population geneticists had allowed for. Mayr, on the basis of an understanding of genes and direct observations of evolutionary processes from field research, introduced the biological species concept, which defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from all other populations. Both Dobzhansky and Mayr emphasized the importance of subspecies reproductively isolated by geographical barriers in the emergence of new species. The paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson helped to incorporate paleontology with a statistical analysis of the fossil record that showed a pattern consistent with the branching and non-directional pathway of evolution of organisms predicted by the modern synthesis. 
Evidence for evolution.
[[File:Glyptodon-Armadillo.jpg|left|thumb|200px| During the voyage of the "Beagle", naturalist Charles Darwin collected fossils in South America, and found fragments of armor which he thought were like giant versions of the scales on the modern armadillos living nearby. On his return, the anatomist Richard Owen showed him that the fragments were from gigantic extinct glyptodons, related to the armadillos. This was one of the patterns of distribution that helped Darwin to
develop his theory.]]
Scientific evidence for evolution comes from many aspects of biology and includes fossils, homologous structures, and molecular similarities between species' DNA.
Fossil record.
Research in the field of paleontology, the study of fossils, supports the idea that all living organisms are related. Fossils provide evidence that accumulated changes in organisms over long periods of time have led to the diverse forms of life we see today. A fossil itself reveals the organism's structure and the relationships between present and extinct species, allowing paleontologists to construct a family tree for all of the life forms on Earth.
Modern paleontology began with the work of Georges Cuvier (1769–1832). Cuvier noted that, in sedimentary rock, each layer contained a specific group of fossils. The deeper layers, which he proposed to be older, contained simpler life forms. He noted that many forms of life from the past are no longer present today. One of Cuvier’s successful contributions to the understanding of the fossil record was establishing extinction as a fact. In an attempt to explain extinction, Cuvier proposed the idea of “revolutions” or catastrophism in which he speculated that geological catastrophes had occurred throughout the Earth’s history, wiping out large numbers of species. Cuvier's theory of revolutions was later replaced by uniformitarian theories, notably those of James Hutton and Charles Lyell who proposed that the Earth’s geological changes were gradual and consistent. However, current evidence in the fossil record supports the concept of mass extinctions. As a result, the general idea of catastrophism has re-emerged as a valid hypothesis for at least some of the rapid changes in life forms that appear in the fossil records.
A very large number of fossils have now been discovered and identified. These fossils serve as a chronological record of evolution. The fossil record provides examples of transitional species that demonstrate ancestral links between past and present life forms.
One such transitional fossil is "Archaeopteryx", an ancient organism that had the distinct characteristics of a reptile (such as a long, bony tail and conical teeth) yet also had characteristics of birds (such as feathers and a wishbone). The implication from such a find is that modern reptiles and birds arose from a common ancestor.

Comparative anatomy.
The comparison of similarities between organisms of their form or appearance of parts, called their morphology, has long been a way to classify life into closely related groups. This can be done by comparing the structure of adult organisms in different species or by comparing the patterns of how cells grow, divide and even migrate during an organism's development.
Taxonomy.
Taxonomy is the branch of biology that names and classifies all living things. Scientists use morphological and genetic similarities to assist them in categorizing life forms based on ancestral relationships. For example, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans all belong to the same taxonomic grouping referred to as a family – in this case the family called "Hominidae". These animals are grouped together because of similarities in morphology that come from common ancestry (called "homology").
Strong evidence for evolution comes from the analysis of "homologous" structures: structures in different species that no longer perform the same task but which share a similar structure. Such is the case of the forelimbs of mammals. The forelimbs of a human, cat, whale, and bat all have strikingly similar bone structures. However, each of these four species' forelimbs performs a different task. The same bones that construct a bat's wings, which are used for flight, also construct a whale's flippers, which are used for swimming. Such a "design" makes little sense if they are unrelated and uniquely constructed for their particular tasks. The theory of evolution explains these homologous structures: all four animals shared a common ancestor, and each has undergone change over many generations. These changes in structure have produced forelimbs adapted for different tasks.
However, anatomical comparisons can be misleading, as not all anatomical similarities indicate a close relationship. Organisms that share similar environments will often develop similar physical features, a process known as "convergent evolution". Both sharks and dolphins have similar body forms, yet are only distantly related – sharks are fish and dolphins are mammals. Such similarities are a result of both populations being exposed to the same selective pressures. Within both groups, changes that aid swimming have been favored. Thus, over time, they developed similar appearances (morphology), even though they are not closely related.
Embryology.
In some cases, anatomical comparison of structures in the embryos of two or more species provides evidence for a shared ancestor that may not be obvious in the adult forms. As the embryo develops, these homologies can be lost to view, and the structures can take on different functions. Part of the basis of classifying the vertebrate group (which includes humans), is the presence of a tail (extending beyond the anus) and pharyngeal slits. Both structures appear during some stage of embryonic development but are not always obvious in the adult form.
Because of the morphological similarities present in embryos of different species during development, it was once assumed that organisms re-enact their evolutionary history as an embryo. It was thought that human embryos passed through an amphibian then a reptilian stage before completing their development as mammals. Such a re-enactment, (often called "Recapitulation theory"), is not supported by scientific evidence. What does occur, however, is that the first stages of development are similar in broad groups of organisms. At very early stages, for instance, all vertebrates appear extremely similar, but do not exactly resemble any ancestral species. As development continues, specific features emerge from this basic pattern.
Vestigial structures.
Homology includes a unique group of shared structures referred to as "vestigial structures". "Vestigial" refers to anatomical parts that are of minimal, if any, value to the organism that possesses them. These apparently illogical structures are remnants of organs that played an important role in ancestral forms. Such is the case in whales, which have small vestigial bones that appear to be remnants of the leg bones of their ancestors which walked on land. Humans also have vestigial structures, including the ear muscles, the wisdom teeth, the appendix, the tail bone, body hair (including goose bumps), and the semilunar fold in the corner of the eye.
Biogeography.
Biogeography is the study of the geographical distribution of species. Evidence from biogeography, especially from the biogeography of oceanic islands, played a key role in convincing both Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace that species evolved with a branching pattern of common descent. Islands often contain endemic species, species not found anywhere else, but those species are often related to species found on the nearest continent. Furthermore islands often contain clusters of closely related species that have very different ecological niches, that is have different ways of making a living in the environment. Such clusters form through a process of adaptive radiation where a single ancestral species colonizes an island that has a variety of open ecological niches and then diversifies by evolving into different species adapted to fill those empty niches. Well studied examples include Darwin's finches, a group of 13 finch species endemic to the Galapagos Islands, and the Hawaiian honeycreepers, a group of birds that once, before extinctions caused by humans, numbered 60 species filling diverse ecological roles, all descended from a single finch like ancestor that arrived on the Hawaiian islands some 4 million years ago. Another example is the Silversword alliance, a group of perennial plant species, also endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, that inhabit a variety of habitats and come in a variety of shapes and sizes that include trees, shrubs, and ground hugging mats, but which can be hybridized with one another and with certain tarweed species found on the west coast of North America; it appears that one of those tarweeds colonized Hawaii in the past, and gave rise to the entire Silversword alliance.
Molecular biology.
Every living organism (with the possible exception of RNA viruses) contains molecules of DNA, which carries genetic information. Genes are the pieces of DNA that carry this information, and they influence the properties of an organism. Genes determine an individual's general appearance and to some extent their behavior. If two organisms are closely related, their DNA will be very similar. On the other hand, the more distantly related two organisms are, the more differences they will have. For example, brothers are closely related and have very similar DNA, while cousins share a more distant relationship and have far more differences in their DNA. Similarities in DNA are used to determine the relationships between species in much the same manner as they are used to show relationships between individuals. For example, comparing chimpanzees with gorillas and humans shows that there is as much as a 96 percent similarity between the DNA of humans and chimps. Comparisons of DNA indicate that humans and chimpanzees are more closely related to each other than either species is to gorillas.
The field of molecular systematics focuses on measuring the similarities in these molecules and using this information to work out how different types of organisms are related through evolution. These comparisons have allowed biologists to build a "relationship tree" of the evolution of life on Earth. They have even allowed scientists to unravel the relationships between organisms whose common ancestors lived such a long time ago that no real similarities remain in the appearance of the organisms.
Artificial selection.
"Artificial selection" is the controlled breeding of domestic plants and animals. Humans determine which animal or plant will reproduce and which of the offspring will survive; thus, they determine which genes will be passed on to future generations. The process of artificial selection has had a significant impact on the evolution of domestic animals. For example, people have produced different types of dogs by controlled breeding. The differences in size between the Chihuahua and the Great Dane are the result of artificial selection. Despite their dramatically different physical appearance, they and all other dogs evolved from a few wolves domesticated by humans in what is now China less than 15,000 years ago.
Artificial selection has produced a wide variety of plants. In the case of maize (corn), recent genetic evidence suggests that domestication occurred 10,000 years ago in central Mexico. Prior to domestication, the edible portion of the wild form was small and difficult to collect. Today "The Maize Genetics Cooperation • Stock Center" maintains a collection of more than 10,000 genetic variations of maize that have arisen by random mutations and chromosomal variations from the original wild type.
In artificial selection the new breed or variety that emerges is the one with random mutations attractive to humans, while in natural selection the surviving species is the one with random mutations useful to it in its non-human environment. In both natural and artificial selection the variations are a result of random mutations, and the underlying genetic processes are essentially the same. Darwin carefully observed the outcomes of artificial selection in animals and plants to form many of his arguments in support of natural selection. Much of his book "On the Origin of Species" was based on these observations of the many varieties of domestic pigeons arising from artificial selection. Darwin proposed that if humans could achieve dramatic changes in domestic animals in short periods, then natural selection, given millions of years, could produce the differences seen in living things today.
Co-evolution.
Co-evolution is a process in which two or more species influence the evolution of each other. All organisms are influenced by life around them; however, in co-evolution there is evidence that genetically determined traits in each species directly resulted from the interaction between the two organisms.
An extensively documented case of co-evolution is the relationship between "Pseudomyrmex", a type of ant, and the acacia, a plant that the ant uses for food and shelter. The relationship between the two is so intimate that it has led to the evolution of special structures and behaviors in both organisms. The ant defends the acacia against herbivores and clears the forest floor of the seeds from competing plants. In response, the plant has evolved swollen thorns that the ants use as shelter and special flower parts that the ants eat.
Such co-evolution does not imply that the ants and the tree choose to behave in an altruistic manner. Rather, across a population small genetic changes in both ant and tree benefited each. The benefit gave a slightly higher chance of the characteristic being passed on to the next generation. Over time, successive mutations created the relationship we observe today.
Species.
Given the right circumstances, and enough time, evolution leads to the emergence of new species. Scientists have struggled to find a precise and all-inclusive definition of "species". Ernst Mayr (1904–2005) defined a species as a population or group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed naturally with one another to produce viable, fertile offspring. (The members of a species cannot produce viable, fertile offspring with members of "other" species). Mayr's definition has gained wide acceptance among biologists, but does not apply to organisms such as bacteria, which reproduce asexually.
Speciation is the lineage-splitting event that results in two separate species forming from a single common ancestral population. A widely accepted method of speciation is called "allopatric speciation". Allopatric speciation begins when a population becomes geographically separated. Geological processes, such as the emergence of mountain ranges, the formation of canyons, or the flooding of land bridges by changes in sea level may result in separate populations. For speciation to occur, separation must be substantial, so that genetic exchange between the two populations is completely disrupted. In their separate environments, the genetically isolated groups follow their own unique evolutionary pathways. Each group will accumulate different mutations as well as be subjected to different selective pressures. The accumulated genetic changes may result in separated populations that can no longer interbreed if they are reunited. Barriers that prevent interbreeding are either "prezygotic" (prevent mating or fertilization) or "postzygotic" (barriers that occur after fertilization). If interbreeding is no longer possible, then they will be considered different species. The result of four billion years of evolution is the diversity of life around us, with an estimated 1.75 million different species in existence today.
Usually the process of speciation is slow, occurring over very long time spans; thus direct observations within human life-spans are rare. However speciation has been observed in present day organisms, and past speciation events are recorded in fossils. Scientists have documented the formation of five new species of cichlid fishes from a single common ancestor that was isolated fewer than 5000 years ago from the parent stock in Lake Nagubago. The evidence for speciation in this case was morphology (physical appearance) and lack of natural interbreeding. These fish have complex mating rituals and a variety of colorations; the slight modifications introduced in the new species have changed the mate selection process and the five forms that arose could not be convinced to interbreed.
Mechanism.
The theory of evolution is widely accepted among the scientific community, serving to link the diverse specialty areas of biology. Evolution provides the field of biology with a solid scientific base. The significance of evolutionary theory is best described by the title of a paper by Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900–1975), published in "American Biology Teacher"; "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution". Nevertheless, the theory of evolution is not static. There is much discussion within the scientific community concerning the mechanisms behind the evolutionary process. For example, the rate at which evolution occurs is still under discussion. In addition, there are conflicting opinions as to which is the primary unit of evolutionary change – the organism or the gene.
Rate of change.
Darwin and his contemporaries viewed evolution as a slow and gradual process. Evolutionary trees are based on the idea that profound differences in species are the result of many small changes that accumulate over long periods.
Gradualism had its basis in the works of the geologists James Hutton (1726–1797) and Charles Lyell (1797–1875). Hutton's view suggests that profound geological change was the cumulative product of a relatively slow continuing operation of processes which can still be seen in operation today, as opposed to catastrophism which promoted the idea that sudden changes had causes which can no longer be seen at work. A uniformitarian perspective was adopted for biological changes. Such a view can seem to contradict the fossil record, which often shows evidence of new species appearing suddenly, then persisting in that form for long periods. In the 1970s paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed a theoretical model that suggests that evolution, although a slow process in human terms, undergoes periods of relatively rapid change (ranging between 50,000 and 100,000 years) alternating with long periods of relative stability. Their theory is called "punctuated equilibrium" and explains the fossil record without contradicting Darwin's ideas.
Unit of change.
A common unit of selection in evolution is the organism. Natural selection occurs when the reproductive success of an individual is improved or reduced by an inherited characteristic, and reproductive success is measured by the number of an individual's surviving offspring. The organism view has been challenged by a variety of biologists as well as philosophers. Richard Dawkins (born 1941) proposes that much insight can be gained if we look at evolution from the gene's point of view; that is, that natural selection operates as an evolutionary mechanism on genes as well as organisms. In his 1976 book "The Selfish Gene", he explains:
Others view selection working on many levels, not just at a single level of organism or gene; for example, Stephen Jay Gould called for a hierarchical perspective on selection.

List of San Francisco Giants Opening Day starting pitchers

The San Francisco Giants are a Major League Baseball franchise based in San Francisco, California. They moved to San Francisco from New York in 1958. They play in the National League West division. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Giants have used 28 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 55 seasons since moving to San Francisco. The 28 starters have a combined Opening Day record of 25 wins, 15 losses and 15 no decisions. No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game.
The first Opening Day game for the San Francisco Giants was played against the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 15, 1958 at Seals Stadium, the Giants' first home ball park in San Francisco. Rubén Gómez was the Giants' Opening Day starting pitcher that day, in a game the Giants lost 8–0. That was the Giants' only Opening Day game at Seals Stadium. They also played in two other home parks in San Francisco: Candlestick Park from 1960 to 1999, and AT&T Park, previously called PacBell Park and SBC Park, since 2000. The Giants' Opening Day starting pitchers had a record of seven wins, three losses and seven no decisions at Candlestick Park and have a record of two wins, one loss and one no decision at AT&T Park. That gives the San Francisco Giants' Opening Day starting pitchers a total home record of ten wins, five losses and eight no decisions. Their record in Opening Day road games is 15 wins, 10 losses and 7 no decisions.
Juan Marichal holds the San Francisco Giants' record for most Opening Day starts, with 10. Marichal had a record in Opening Day starts of six wins, two losses and two no decisions. Tim Lincecum made four Opening Day starts for the Giants, and John Montefusco, Mike Krukow, John Burkett and Liván Hernández each made three Opening Day starts. Sam Jones, Vida Blue, Rick Reuschel, Mark Gardner, Kirk Reuter, Jason Schmidt and Barry Zito have each made two Opening Day starts for the Giants. Marichal has the most wins in Opening Day starts for San Francisco, with six. Reuschel and Burkett are the only pitchers to have won more than one Opening Day start for San Francisco without a loss. Both have records in Opening Day starts of two wins and no losses. Burkett also has a no decision. Zito has the worst record for San Francisco in Opening Day starts, with no wins and two losses. Zito and Marichal have the most losses in Opening Day starts, with two apiece. The Giants have played in the World Series four times since moving to San Francisco, in , , , and , winning in 2010 and 2012. Their Opening Day starting pitchers in those years were Juan Marichal in 1962, Rick Reuschel in 1989, Liván Hernández in 2002 and Tim Lincecum in 2010. The Giants' Opening Day starting pitchers won four of their five Opening Day starts in those seasons, with their only loss coming in 2012.

Afoa Moega Lutu

Afoafouvale Leulumoegafou Su’esu’e Lutu (born February 24, 1947) is an American Samoan politician and lawyer. Lutu has served as the former American Samoan Attorney General.
Lutu was defeated in the 2004 gubernatorial election by Togiola Tulafono. He lost to Togiola Tulafono again in the 2008 American Samoa gubernatorial election, teaming with Velega Savali as his running mate for Lieutenant Governor.
Biography.
Early life.
Afoa Moega Lutu was born on February 24, 1947, to his parents, the Rev. Su’esu’e Solofa Lutu and Vaituutuu Patu Leota Leuluaialii Lutu. He was the fourth of twelve children in his family. Lutu's parents taught at the theological school at the Ekalesia Fa' apotopotoga Kerisinao I Samoa (Congregational Christian Church in Samoa) in what was then known as Western Samoa, which is now the independent nation simply known as Samoa. Lutu's family moved back to American Samoa when he was less than a year old and settled in Amanave, where his parents worked as Christian ministers.
Lutu originally attended St. Theresa Elementary School in Leone, American Samoa. However, his parents moved again to the towns of Fagatogo and Utulei by the time he was six years old to live wife extended family. He was admitted to Feleti Memorial Barstow Foundation Demonstration School for first grade. 
He became salutatorian of his eighth grade class upon graduating from the school. Lutu next entered American Samoa High School. While in high school, his parents relocated to the village of Lauli'i, east of Pago Pago Harbor, to work as ministers in the village. He resided with his grandparents, Rev. Su’esu’e and Sola, in Utulei during the school week, at travelled to see his parents on the weekend. Lutu graduated as student body president from high school in 1965. Following his graduation, Lutu was one of four American Samoan students chosen for a cultural exchange program in the United States. Lutu moved to Spirit Lake, Iowa, to attend an extra year of high school as part of the cultural exchange, where stayed at the home of Berkley and Elinor Bedell and their family. Berkley Bedell, Iowan businessman, was later elected as a United States Congressman from Iowa (1975–1987).
Lutu attended Northeast Missouri State University, now known as Truman State University, on a full American Samoa Government scholarship. Lutu met his future wife while at Northest Missouri, Etenauga Alvina Lam Yuen. Etenauga, whose parents were Pastor Tini Inu Lam Yuen and Tululautu Fueainaula Tagaloa Lam Yuen, was also from a large American Samoan family of 11 other siblings. 
He transferred to University of Hawaii at Manoa after two years in Missouri to be closer to his parents, who were working at a Samoan church in Nānākuli, Hawai'i, at the time. He graduated from the University of Hawaii - Manoa in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in political science with a minor in prelaw. His future wife, Etenauga, received her bachelor's degree in nursing from Walla Walla College. Lutu enrolled in the Valparaiso University School of Law with another American Samoa Government scholarship.
Lutu and Etenauga married in Lynwood, California, in 1972. The couple relocated to Valparaiso, Indiana, where Lutu completed his Juris Doctor. Their first child, Christinna Sola, was born in Indiana in 1973. The couple moved to Hawaii following Lutu's completion of law school.
The couple had several more children, including Alvina Lore in 1976; Faauuga Hannacho in 1977; Elinor Matuaifaleese in 1980; Kimberly Malaeimi in 1982; and Florence-Emma Le’ala in 1983. They also had tow sons, Justin Fouvale and Joshua Simanuali’i.
The Afoafouvale clans of American Samoa gave the title of "Afoafouvale" to him in 1989 and was formally granted in a 1990 ceremony. This marked the first time that anyone had held the title of "Afoafouvale" since the middle of the 1970s.
Career.
The family returned to American Samoa in 1975 where Lutu worked as an attorney. They eventually settled in Taputimu. 
Lutu was appointed Attorney General of American Samoa by Governor A. P. Lutali after he was elected governor in 1985. He represented American Samoa and the Lutali administration at the early South Pacific Tuna Treaty negotiations. As Attorney General, Lutu also successfully defended challenges to the traditional Samoan communal land system before United States federal courts and the United States Supreme Court.
He next became the special legal counsel for the President of the American Samoa Senate from 1998 until 1992. Lutu was elected to the American Samoa House of Representatives for Maoputasi District #7 in 1992. He spent two terms, a total of four years, in the House, before leaving his seat to become legal counsel to the American Samoa House of Representatives from 1996 until 1997.
Lutu next served as the head of the Legislative Reference Bureau from 1997 until 2004.
Political ambitions.
Lutu ran for the American Samoa Delegates eat in the United States House of Representatives, but was defeated by Eni Faleomavaega.
Lutu campaigned as the running mate for Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa with Senator Lealaifuaneva Peter Reid for Governor during the 1996 and 2000 American Samoan gubernatorial elections. However, Reid and Lutu lost both elections. They were defeated by former governor Tauese Sunia and then Lt. Governor Tulafono in both 1996 and 2000.
Lutu ran for Governor of American Samoa in 2004 with Taeaoafua Dr. Meki Solomona as his running mate. The two faced incumbent Governor Togiola Tulafono and Lt. Governor Ipulasi Aitofele Sunia in the 2004 general election. However, Tulafono defeated Lutu in the second round runoff election. Tulafono earned 56 percent of the vote while Lutu garnered 44 percent.
2008 Gubernatorial election.
Afoa Moega Lutu once again decided to challenge Gov. Togiola Tulafono for his office in the 2008 gubernatorial election. Lutu's running mate for Lieutenant Governor is Velega Savali, a former American Samoan Treasurer.
Lutu and Savali launched their campaign for Governor at a kick-off campaign rally at the Tradewinds Hotel on May 17, 2008. Approximately 700 people attended the rally. Lutu promised to run on issues such as transparency and improving the territory's public education system.
The gubernatorial election took place on November 4, 2008, and Tulafono was re-elected.

List of The Wild Wild West episodes

This is a complete list of episodes of "The Wild Wild West," an American television series that ran on the CBS network from 1965 to 1969. During its four-season run a total of 104 episodes were broadcast. "The Wild Wild West" is a series that blended westerns – hugely popular on television at the time ("Gunsmoke", "Bonanza", "Wagon Train", "Rawhide", etc.) – with spy adventure, which came into vogue in the wake of the highly successful James Bond films, resulting in such spy-oriented series as "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.", "The Avengers", and "Secret Agent". 
"The Wild Wild West" is set in the 1870s and deals with the exploits of James West (played by Robert Conrad) and Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin), two agents of the United States Secret Service who work directly under the command of then-President Ulysses S. Grant. James West is presented as a sort of "James Bond of the West," i.e. the handsome, muscular action-hero who is handy with his fists, as well as a dashing ladies' man. Artemus Gordon is West's partner, a master of disguises and also the inventor of the many gadgets that the two of them use in the course of their adventures. The two men travel about in a private train and use their talents to vanquish the many dastardly villains that threatened the United States — among them, disgraced ex-soldiers seeking revenge against President Grant, power-hungry megalomaniacs, and mad scientists with their brilliant but diabolical inventions. The last group includes the recurring character of Dr. Miguelito Loveless, played by 3'11" Michael Dunn. As series producer Bruce Lansbury stated:
"Jim 's world was one of two-faced villainy, male and female, countless 'Mickey Finns,' and needle-tipped baroque pinkie rings that put him to sleep even as he embraced their dispensers. There were inevitable trap doors, hotel walls that ground their victims to dust or revolved into lush Aubrey Beardsley settings next door, lethal chairs that tossed occupants skyward or alternatively dumped them into dank sewers that subterraneously crisscrossed countless cow towns of the period. And then there was that old Dutch sea captain, leaning in the corner of the swill-hole of a bar, who inexplicably winked at Jim as he entered … Artemus, of course, in one of his thousand disguises."
Ten years after the series was cancelled a made-for-television revival movie, "The Wild Wild West Revisited", aired and was successful enough to warrant a follow-up entitled "More Wild Wild West" (1980), thus bringing the total number of episodes up to 106. The death of Ross Martin in 1981 ended any plans for a third film.
DVD releases.
The entire four-season run of "The Wild Wild West" is available on DVD from Paramount Home Video in both individual box sets of each season as well as a box containing the whole series. Only the latter, however, contains the reunion films.
The complete run of the series is present below in broadcast order. Included are the episode titles, directors, writers, broadcast dates, production codes, guest stars and the roles they played, and a brief plot synopsis. Also, the various disguises that Ross Martin used in his Artemus Gordon character are listed.
Season One: 1965–1966.
"The Wild Wild West" was created by Michael Garrison, a movie producer "(Peyton Place, The Long, Hot Summer, An Affair to Remember)" who had, at one time, co-owned the rights to Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, "Casino Royale." Garrison produced the series pilot episode himself but, once the series was approved by the CBS network, it became necessary to find a more experienced producer to handle the subsequent episodes. Garrison, in the meantime, was moved into the position of Executive Producer. Collier Young, who hitherto had produced a series entitled "The Rogues", was assigned to "The Wild Wild West" but, after overseeing only three episodes, was replaced due to "a difference in concept between the network and ." Fred Freiberger, his replacement, brought the series back on track with adventures featuring beautiful women, strong adversaries, and "something very bizarre." Also under Freiberger the character of Dr. Loveless was created. Loveless became an immediate hit, resulting in actor Michael Dunn being contracted to do four episodes per season. However, after producing ten episodes, Fred Freiberger was replaced by John Mantley, reputedly due to a behind-the-scenes power struggle. Mantley, who had been associate producer on "Gunsmoke", produced seven episodes before he too was replaced. Mantley returned to his former position on "Gunsmoke" while Gene L. Coon took over the production reins for of "The Wild Wild West." However, Coon left after five episodes to take a screenwriting assignment at Warner Bros., leaving Michael Garrison to take on double-duty as producer and executive producer for the remainder of the season. 
The 28 first season episodes of "The Wild Wild West", all of which were photographed in black and white, were not broadcast in the order that they were filmed. Notably, the early ones produced by Collier Young were moved back in the broadcast schedule in favor of the Fred Freiberger- and John Mantley-produced episodes. The breakdown in broadcast order is thus:
During this season, "The Wild Wild West" placed at #23 in the ratings for the 1965-1966 season. One episode of this season, "The Night of the Howling Light", received an Emmy nomination for Best Cinematography. 
Season Two: 1966–1967.
The second season of "The Wild Wild West" continued the basic format of first season, but also made some changes. The most notable of these was that the series was now shot in color, which enhanced the Victorian ambiance of the 1870s setting. Both Robert Conrad and Ross Martin were given modified wardrobes, with Conrad wearing short "bolero" jackets and tight-fitting pants. There was also a shift in the choreography of the fight scenes, changing the emphasis from karate (largely used in the first season) to boxing. 
As in the first season, Dr. Loveless was featured in four episodes. Meanwhile, an attempt was made to establish another recurring villain with the character of Count Manzeppi (played by Victor Buono, who had appeared in the pilot episode). However, the Count was dropped after only two episodes.
Again, as in the first season, 28 episodes were produced for the season. Initially, Michael Garrison continued in the dual capacity as producer and executive producer. However, after seven episodes, the producing chores were handed to Bruce Lansbury, the younger brother of actress Angela Lansbury, and Garrison returned to working solely as the series' executive producer. Garrison died on August 17, 1966, when he fell down a flight of stairs at his home in Bel Aire.
The breakdown between the two producers, as broadcast, is:
However, the series continued to be listed as "A Michael Garrison Production in association with the CBS Television Network" in the end credits for the rest of the run.
"The Wild Wild West" slipped in the ratings during the second season and failed to be among the 25 most popular shows during the 1966–1967 season. However, guest star Agnes Moorehead won an Emmy as Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her performance in the episode "The Night of the Vicious Valentine."
Season Three: 1967–1968.
The third season of "The Wild Wild West" saw a shift away from fantasy and more toward traditional western with the "villains becoming more political and less outrageous." Also, because of serious health problems, Michael Dunn appeared as Dr. Loveless in only one episode during this season ("The Night Dr. Loveless Died"). 
On January 24, 1968, when "The Wild Wild West" was near the end of shooting for the season, star Robert Conrad, who did the majority of his own stunt work, was seriously injured when he fell from a chandelier during the filming of the episode "The Night of the Fugitives." Production was shut down for the season and the "Fugitives" was completed and broadcast during the fourth season.
All of the episodes of this season were produced by Bruce Lansbury. Due to Conrad's injury only 24 episodes were made for this season. As in the second season, "The Wild Wild West" did not rank among the 25 most popular shows during the 1967-1968 season. 
Season Four: 1968–1969.
Due to his injury near the end of filming of the previous season, the fourth season of "The Wild Wild West" forced Robert Conrad to use a double for any stunt that the studio considered "Chancy." Unfortunately, the fourth season proved unlucky for co-star Ross Martin. On June 26, 1968, during filming of "The Night of the Avaricious Actuary" Martin fell and received a hairline fracture in his shin. As a result, the script the next episode filmed, "The Night of the Juggernaut", was re-written to have Martin's character, Artemus Gordon, receive a leg injury. A far more serious event befell Martin later on in the course of the season's filming. On August 17 of the same year he suffered a massive heart attack. A five-week hiatus in filming had just begun, but Martin's recovery time was much longer. Producer Bruce Lansbury had no choice but again have rewrites of the scripts. Ten episodes were filmed without Martin although he continued to have co-star billing in the opening credits. The absence of his character was explained as being on "special assignment" in Washington. For one of these episodes, "The Night of the Tycoons", James West operated solo. For the remaining nine episodes West worked with other agents. These were:
Ross Martin returned to filming for the final three episodes of the season, which also turned out to be the last episodes of the entire series. "The Wild Wild West" was cancelled after four seasons, possibly due to declining ratings (it again did not place among the top 25), but also possibly due to a crack-down on programs with excessive violence.
During this season, Ross Martin received an Emmy nomination for leading actor in a drama series. All of the fourth season episodes were produced by Bruce Lansbury. As in the third season, Michael Dunn made only one appearance as Dr. Loveless in this season.
Reunion movies.
Ten years after the cancellation of "The Wild Wild West" Robert Conrad and Ross Martin reunited and reprised their respective roles as government agents James West and Artemus Gordon in a television reunion film", The Wild Wild West Revisited". This film proved to be one of CBS' highest rated specials of the year, thus warranting a second reunion film, "More Wild Wild West". The second film, however, proved less successful.
These two reunion movies were produced by Robert Jacks and directed by Burt Kennedy and are notably more comical than the original series.
Emmy Awards.
During its four-year run "The Wild Wild West" received three Emmy nominations:
Producers.
"The Wild Wild West" had six different producers during the course of its four-season run, plus a seventh for the two reunion movies. A breakdown of the episodes and their producers appears in the chart below. 
Directors.
"The Wild Wild West" employed a large number of directors during its run, with Irving J. Moore directing the most episodes (25 total). 
Of note is that three episodes were directed by William Witney, who had co-directed many "cliffhangers" during the 1930s and 1940s, including "Zorro Rides Again", "The Lone Ranger", and "The Adventures of Captain Marvel". Also among the series directors are Mark Rydell (who would go on to direct "On Golden Pond" with Katharine Hepburn, Henry Fonda, and Jane Fonda) and Richard Donner (later to direct "The Omen", "Superman", and the "Lethal Weapon" series).
Guest stars.
During its run, "The Wild Wild West" featured a large number of notable guest stars. Many of these guests also appeared on "." These actors and the titles to the episodes of both series that they appeared in are listed below. A video montage of some of these performance can be found on YouTube.
Merchandise tie-ins.
As with many television series, "The Wild Wild West" had several merchandise tie-ins during its run. These are listed below.

List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania

The Nobel Prizes are awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Karolinska Institute, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to individuals who make outstanding contributions in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. Another prize, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for contributors to the field of economics. Each prize is awarded by a separate committee; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics, the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a cash prize that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, the winners of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. In 2008, the winners were awarded a prize amount of 10,000,000 SEK. The awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.
As of 2013, there have been 28 laureates affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, 8 alone in the last 10 years. The University of Pennsylvania considers laureates who attended the university as undergraduate students, graduate students or were members of the faculty as affiliated laureates. Otto Fritz Meyerhof, a research professor in physiological chemistry, was the first University of Pennsylvania laureate, winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1922. Two Nobel Prizes were shared by University of Pennsylvania laureates; Ragnar Granit and Haldan Keffer Hartline won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Three laureates, Christian B. Anfinsen, Gerald Edelman, and John Robert Schrieffer, won different Nobel Prizes in 1972, and were awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1973. Nine University of Pennsylvania laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, more than any other category.

Central Waterfront, Seattle

The Central Waterfront of Seattle, in the state of Washington, USA, is the most urbanized portion of the Elliott Bay shore. It runs from the Pioneer Square shore roughly northwest past Downtown Seattle and Belltown, ending at the Broad Street site of the Olympic Sculpture Park.
The Central Waterfront (website) was once the hub of Seattle's maritime activity. Since the construction of a container port to its south in the 1960s, the area has increasingly been converted to recreational and retail uses. As of 2008, several century-old piers are devoted to shops and restaurants. There are several parks, a ferris wheel, an aquarium, and one over-water hotel.
Some docks remain on the Central Waterfront, under the authority of the Port of Seattle, including a cruise ship dock, ferry terminals, and a fireboat dock. There are many architectural vestiges of the area's past status as the heart of a port, and a handful of businesses have remained in operation since that time.
Location and extent.
As with most Seattle neighborhoods, the Central Waterfront has no defined and agreed-upon boundaries. According to the Seattle Waterfront Plan, the Central Waterfront runs roughly from Jackson Street in the Pioneer Square neighborhood, north along the Elliott Bay shore through Downtown to Broad Street, near the north end of Belltown. To its south is the Port of Seattle's container port; to its north is the Olympic Sculpture Park. That plan makes no clear statement as to how far inland the "waterfront" neighborhood might extend. 
Real estate and consulting firm Wronsky, Gibbons & Riely PLLC describe the Central Waterfront as a "predominately linear district running north-south along Alaskan Way" from Pier 48 to Pier 70. Pier 48 is at the foot of Yesler Way, three blocks north of Jackson Street (the city plan's southern boundary); Pier 70 is at the foot of Broad Street. 
A 2006 study by the Department of Neighborhoods agrees on where to place the north end of the district, but puts its southern boundary at Columbia Street (a block north of Yesler Way at the water's edge). Below Battery Street, this study considers the neighborhood to extend inland to First Avenue. Above Battery Street, they consider the neighborhood to extend only to Elliott Avenue, taking in facilities such as the World Trade Center. The southern cutoff at Columbia Street completely excludes the Pioneer Square neighborhood, while the extension inland to First Avenue means that they consider the former warehouse district along Western Avenue and the entire Pike Place Market Historical District as part of the Central Waterfront.
In its southern portion, the waterfront is separated from inland Seattle by the Alaskan Way Viaduct, which continues northward through downtown. As one continues north, the land rises more rapidly away from the water, creating a sharper distinction between waterfront and uplands. There are several distinct passages between the Central Waterfront and the uplands: the Harbor Steps at University Street, leading to the Seattle Art Museum; the Pike Hill Climb from the Seattle Aquarium to the Pike Place Market; and, farther north, the Lenora Street and Bell Street Bridges. The last two are not heavily used, because they do not connect to any major upland destination.
Historically, Seattle's Central Waterfront continued farther south, with a similar character. Since the mid-1960s, the area to the south has been a container port.
Seattle's current pier numbering scheme dates from World War II; prior to that era, for example, the present Pier 55 was Pier 4 and Pier 57 was Pier 6.
Roads.
As of 2008, the two main routes along the Central Waterfront are Alaskan Way and (from Battery Street south) the Alaskan Way Viaduct. Alaskan Way follows the route of the earlier railway line and one-time Railroad Avenue along the "Ram's Horn" from just north of S. Holgate Street in the Industrial District to Broad Street at the north end of the Central Waterfront. 
The original Railroad Avenue was built as a planked roadway on pilings over the waters of Elliott Bay. The chaos of horses and buggies, pedestrians, rail cars, multiple railroad tracks and multiple sidings was somewhat relieved when the Great Northern built a rail tunnel (1903–1906) under Downtown. From that time, only rail traffic that actually needed to access the waterfront had to use Railroad Avenue; other trains could bypass the busy corridor. Still, there continued to be problems with the structural integrity of the planked roadway. Between 1911 and 1916, a concrete seawall strengthened the portion of the waterfront between S. Washington Street and Madison Street. By 1936 the seawall extended northward to Bay Street, its current extent as of 2008, and Railroad Avenue officially became Alaskan Way. Still, it was not properly paved until 1940, during the administration of mayor Arthur Langlie. In the early 1950s, the Alaskan Way Viaduct was built, paralleling Alaskan Way for much of its distance.
From May 29, 1982 to November 19, 2005 the George Benson Waterfront Streetcar Line ran parallel to Alaskan Way on the land side. The trolley barn was demolished to build the Olympic Sculpture Park, and since 2005 a roughly equivalent route has been served by a bus. The tracks and stations remain.
Piers and buildings.
The piers of Seattle's Central Waterfront are numbered from Pier 46, at the south end of the area, to Pier 70 at the northern end.
Piers 46–48.
Pier 46, and land filled, is the southernmost pier on the Central Waterfront and the northernmost pier of the Port of Seattle's container port. For two years in the early 2000s part of it was operated by the Church Council as a homeless shelter. 
South Korean container shipping company Hanjin Shipping has a lease at the pier through 2015 with a 10-year renewal option. Nonetheless, there has been much discussion about the future of Pier 46. Proposals have included a sports arena, mixed-income or low-income housing, condos and a shopping center, or continued use as part of the port.
Pier 48, at the foot of Main Street, also incorporates the former Pier 47. 
Nirvana, Cypress Hill and the Breeders performed a concert at Pier 48 on December 13, 1993, which was recorded for MTV. Until 1999, the pier was the Seattle terminal for a ferry service to Victoria, British Columbia using the ship "Princess Marguerite". After the final departure of the "Princess Marguerite", Pier 48 became home to a museum ship, the Soviet-era Foxtrot class submarine "Cobra". The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) purchased the pier from the Port of Seattle in 2008. Citing safety and the expense of maintaining the buildings on the worm-eaten pier, WSDOT demolished the warehouse on the pier in July 2010 in order to use the space as a staging area for the coming demolition of the nearby Alaskan Way Viaduct. 
Piers 46–48 are roughly in the area once occupied by Ballast Island ("see above"). Pier 48 began life in 1901 as Pier B of the Pacific Coast Company's Ocean Dock, which also had two other piers (A and C, the latter also known as City Dock). In the early 20th century, there was a terminal here for the Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad.
Harbor Entrance Pergola.
As of 2008 there is no Pier 49 as such; the site used to be the Washington Street Boat Landing, but is closed off and unused. This was roughly the site of both the pre-fire and post-fire Yesler's Wharf ("see above") and of Piers 1 and 2, built by the Northern Pacific some time between 1901 (when the post-fire Yesler's Wharf was demolished) and 1904. The one prominent remaining feature of the crumbling wharf is the Harbor Entrance Pergola, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally it functioned as a landing point for boats bringing passengers from ships. Over the years since the boat landing was closed, various uses have been proposed, including a terminal for the King County Water Taxi route to West Seattle or a mooring point for the historic tugboat "Arthur Foss". As of 2010, the site has become the Downtown terminal for the West Seattle water taxi. On September 26, 2010, a water taxi carrying 78 passengers failed to reverse its engines and slammed into the pier. 7 were injured.
The Harbor Entrance Pergola was the last-constructed of the historic structures associated with Seattle's Pioneer Square district, and is the district's only important landmark on the west side of Alaskan Way. It was designed by Seattle City Architect Daniel Riggs Huntington and built in 1920. Huntington was also co-architect of the nearby Morrison Hotel (1909) and was responsible for the 1912 repairs to Colman Dock on the site of the present ferry terminal. Huntington also designed the Lake Union Steam Plant, built in 1914. The pergola was restored in the 1970s by the Committee of 33, a local Seattle philanthropic organization.
Washington State Ferry Terminal.
Pier 50 and Pier 52 are operating terminals of Washington State Ferries. As of 2008, there is no longer a Pier 51. Passenger-only ferry service runs from Pier 50 to Vashon Island, while ferries carrying both vehicles and passengers run from Pier 52 to Bainbridge Island and Bremerton, Washington.
Pier 52 was historically known as Colman Dock. The original Colman Dock was built by Scottish engineer James Colman in 1882. It burned with most of the rest of the city in the Great Seattle Fire of 1889, but was quickly rebuilt. In 1908, Colman extended the dock to a total length of and added a domed waiting room and a clocktower. Calamity hit four years later. On the night of April 25, 1912, the steel-hulled ship "Alameda" accidentally set its engines "full speed ahead" instead of reversing, and slammed into the dock. The dock tower fell into the bay and the sternwheeler "Telegraph" was sunk. The clock was salvaged, as was the "Telegraph", and the dock was reconstructed with a new tower. No one died in the "Alameda" accident, but a less dramatic accident the following month proved fatal. On May 19, 1912, a gangplank collapsed as passengers were boarding the Black Ball steamer "Flyer". At least 60 people fell into the water. One woman and one child died.
In 1912, Puget Sound was still served by the "Mosquito Fleet", an assortment of boats plying a variety of routes. The following year, Joshua Green founded the Puget Sound Navigation Company (PSNC or Black Ball Line). Within about a decade, they had consolidated control of regional ferries. In the mid-1930s they modernized Colman Dock, using an Art Deco style that matched their streamlined signature ferry "MV Kalakala".
In 1951, Washington State bought out PSNC and took over the ferry system. Work on the present terminal began a decade later; there have been several reconfigurations and modernizations since. The very month that the state ferry terminal opened, it was the subject of another accident. The "Kalakala", which had recently been voted Seattle's second biggest attraction after the then-new Space Needle, rammed the terminal February 21, 1966. Though dramatic, the damage proved not to be severe. The ferry needed only minor repairs and was back in service the next day. Repairs to the slip cost $80,000 and took two months to complete.
The clock from the old Colman Dock tower, dunked into the bay in the 1912 "Alameda" accident and removed in the 1936 renovation, was rediscovered (lying in pieces) in 1976, purchased by the Port of Seattle in 1985, restored, given as a gift to the Washington State Department of Transportation, and reinstalled on the present Colman Dock May 18, 1985.
The Grand Trunk Pacific dock stood just north of Colman Dock at the foot of Marion Street. The original dock was built in 1910 as the largest wooden pier on the West Coast. It was not there for long. On July 30, 1914, it was swept away by an explosion and massive fire. The cause has never been determined. Five people died and 29 more were injured. The flames were hot enough to scorch several parts of Colman Dock, but the fire department managed to contain the fire largely to the one pier. A replacement dock was promptly built, and survived until 1964, when it was replaced by waiting area for automobiles boarding ferries at the new ferry terminal.
Fire Station No. 5.
Pier 53, a very short pier just north of the ferry terminal near the foot of Madison Street, is the site of Seattle Fire Station No. 5, at 925 Alaskan Way. The present 1963 building is the third fire station at this address and the fourth to serve the Central Waterfront. The fire department used to play a particularly critical role on the waterfront: not only were the piers all made of wood; until federal money helped pay for the construction of a seawall in 1934, so was the road along the water (prior to that Railroad Avenue, after that Alaskan Way). The Great Seattle Fire of 1889 had consumed the piers as far north as Union Street along with the rest of the heart of the city.
After the Great Fire, a small one-story wood frame firehouse was erected near the foot of Madison Street, but not quite at the present site. It opened January 3, 1891 with a crew of nine, the new fireboat "Snoqualmie" and a small hose wagon. In 1902, a larger two-story wood frame building was constructed on the present site and in 1910, the new fireboat "Duwamish" replaced the "Snoqualmie". The wood frame building was demolished in 1916 and replaced by an elegant brick building in 1917, incorporating Craftsman and Tudor Revival details. An additional fireboat "Alki" came into service in 1928.
While the 1917 fire station was recognized as an aesthetically good building, by the early 1960s its supporting pier timbers were becoming unsafe. The building was demolished in early 1961. After extensive work on the pier supports, the new modern building by Durham, Anderson & Freed (Robert Durham, David R. Anderson, and Aaron Freed) opened in December 1963.
Piers 54–56.
Pier 54 (originally Pier 3) and its shed were constructed in 1900 by the Northern Pacific Railroad, the southernmost of their three adjacent piers between Madison and University Streets. The shed's first tenants were Galbraith and Bacon (James Galbraith and Cecil Bacon) who dealt in grain and hay, and also in building materials. In Mosquito Fleet days it became known as the Galbraith Dock, from which the Kitsap County Transportation Company, run by James Galbraith's son Walter Galbraith, competed against the Black Ball Line at the Colman Dock. It was home port for the "Kitsap", the "Utopia", the "Reliance" and the "Hyak". From 1929 to the mid-1930s it was general headquarters for Gorst Air Transport, who operated a seaplane service from there, using Keystone-Loening planes. They also operated out of Bremerton across the Sound. Through this period, the Northern Pacific still owned the pier, but by 1944 the Washington Fish and Oyster Company (now Ocean Beauty Seafoods) had purchased the pier and was its main tenant. Engineering firm Reese and Callender Associates helped them reinforce the pier and to adapt it to its new use.
By 1938, the Kitsap Transportation Company was out of business. That year, Ivar Haglund rented the northeast corner of the pier shed for a one-room aquarium, which included a small fish and chips stand. The aquarium closed around 1945, at which time the restaurant moved to the southeastern corner and was redesigned in Streamline Moderne style. Ivar's Acres of Clams, named after an old folk song, became the flagship of the Ivar's chain of seafood restaurants. In 1966, Haglund purchased the pier, and Washington Fish and Oyster Company became his tenant. The restaurant was repeatedly redesigned and expanded over the years, achieving more or less its present configuration before Haglund's death in 1985.
Since 1988, Pier 54 has been home not only to Ivar's Acres of Clams, but also to the current incarnation of Ye Olde Curiosity Shop, which has occupied a succession of venues on the Central Waterfront since its founding in 1899. Besides the usual run of tourist souvenirs, it sells a variety of Northwest Native art; the store prides itself on dealing directly with the artists. They also carry Russian lacquer boxes, matreshka dolls and porcelain figurines, copper and wooden postcards, music boxes, and a variety of other unusual items. None of these are nearly as unusual as the store's "museum" curiosities, which are not for sale: "Sylvester" the mummy, fetal conjoined twin calves, a collection of shrunken human heads, a woven cedar bark hat worn by Chief Seattle, whale and walrus oosiks, and a number of items that appeared in Ripley's Believe It Or Not.
Pier 55, at the foot of Spring Street, was originally named Pier 4. The first Pier 4, built in 1900, collapsed in September 1901, causing the loss of at least 1700 tons of freight. No one was killed in the accident, and the following year the Northern Pacific Railroad completed a new Pier 4, this time with better bracing, which survives today as the renamed Pier 55. Its first tenant, the Arlington Dock Company, was a shipping agent for passenger steamships to several West Coast cities and to Alaska, Asia and Europe. The pier was used for passenger service until around World War I. The Fisheries Supply Company became the principal tenant from at least 1938 to the 1980s. In 1945, the pier was remodeled. Structural improvements were made at that time by Melvin O. Sylliaasen and in the 1960s by the engineering firm Harvey Dodd and Associates. Further improvements were made in the late 1990s, along with some alterations to the exterior of the pier shed.
The north side of Pier 55 is the downtown terminus of the Elliott Bay Water Taxi to West Seattle, which runs from May to October approximately. Between Piers 55 and 56, and utilizing parts of both piers as of 2008, Argosy Cruises moor the tour boats "Royal Argosy", "Spirit of Seattle", "Lady Mary", "Goodtime II", and "Sightseer". Among its routes is the boat to Tillicum Village on Blake Island.
Pier 56 (originally Pier 5), the third of the Northern Pacific Railroad wharves, was constructed in 1900. President Theodore Roosevelt landed there on the steamer "Spokane" on May 23, 1903. With the adjacent Pier 4/55, it was one of the two Arlington Docks, but is better known as the base of operations for Frank Waterhouse and Company, a steamship line that rose to prominence during the Klondike Gold Rush. They provided transportation to the Yukon and Alaska, including the Bering Sea, and transported American soldiers to Manila in the Philippines during the Spanish American War of (1898–1899). Eventually, they serviced Hawaii, the Mediterranean and Russia, but went bankrupt in 1920.
After the Waterhouse company, the pier housed a succession of firms: the Hayden Dock Company, Shepard Line Intercoastal Service, and the Northland Transportation Company, as well as the Arlington Dock Company. During the 1962 Century 21 Exposition, the World's Fair at what afterwards became Seattle Center, the pier added curio shops, restaurants, fish houses, etc., and ceased to be a transportation hub. Trident Imports, opened on the pier around that time, had a decades-long run of importing everything from rattan furniture from Southeast Asia to chocolate from Belgium. Ted Griffin's Seattle Marine Aquarium was located at the west end of the pier. Its star attraction, Namu the killer whale, died in 1966. The architecture, landscape and urban design firm Mithun completed a renovation of the pier in 2000 and is now housed in the second floor of the pier shed.
Piers 57–63.
The city purchased Pier 57 in 1971 and Piers 58 to 61 in 1978, after cargo shipping at the piers was relocated years earlier to the container port to the south. In 1989, the city traded Pier 57 for Piers 62 and 63.
Pier 57 (originally Pier 6) near the foot of University Street was built in 1902 by the Miller and Geske Construction Company and repeatedly modified over the course of the next decade. It was originally built for the John B. Agen Company. In 1909, the pier passed into the hands of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad, the last of four transcontinental railroads to reach Seattle. The Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul was commonly known as the "Milwaukee Road", so the pier became known as the "Milwaukee Pier". It soon became the terminal for the McCormick Steamship Line, the Munson McCormick Line and Osaka Shosen Kaisha, and by the mid-1930s was also known as the "McCormick Terminal". In the 1950s at least part of the pier was used for fish processing. By the 1960s, the Port of Seattle owned the pier, and had cut holes in the deck for recreational fishing, but the pilings were deteriorating and the pier was settling unevenly. In 1971, the City purchased the pier from the Port and renovated it over the next three years. The renovated pier, now known as the "Bay Pavilion", has restaurants, shops, an amusement arcade,and an early 20th-century carousel. In June of 2012 a 175 foot ferris wheel, The Seattle Great Wheel, opened. The wheel has 42 climate-controlled gondolas, each holding up to six passengers. Pier 57 is now privately owned after the city traded it for Piers 62 and 63.
Pier 58 (originally Pier 7) was constructed during the same period as the renovation of Pier 57, Waterfront Park, designed by the Bumgardner Partnership and consultants, was constructed on the site of the Schwabacher Wharf demolished in the 1950s. The Schwabacher Wharf had been just far enough north to survive the Great Seattle Fire in 1889. In the 1890s, it was the site of two prominent events in the city's history. The freighter "Miike Maru" opened Seattle's Japan trade by docking there August 31, 1896. Less than a year later, July 17, 1897, the steamship "Portland" arrived from Alaska bearing a "ton of gold", from the Klondike, Yukon. The ensuing Yukon Gold Rush formed strong bonds between Seattle and Alaska, and brought enormous wealth to Seattle as the "Gateway to Alaska". 
Pier 59 is the site of the main building of the Seattle Aquarium, built on a pier shed first constructed in 1905.
In 1896 fish and grain dealers Ainsworth and Dunn ("see below") built a pier at the location of today's designated city landmark Pier 59, originally Pier 8, also known as the Pike Street Pier. The pier had to be reconfigured because the 1897 Thomson/Cotterill plan dictated that all piers run parallel to one another. Ainsworth and Dunn left this pier around the time the present shed was constructed; subsequent tenants were grain dealer Willis Robinson and the Northwestern Steamship Company. By 1912, the pier was owned and largely occupied by steamship agent Dodwell Dock and Warehouse Company, owened by Dodwell & Co. (Hong Kong). It became known as the Dodwell Dock. That name fell out of usage when the pier was sold in 1916 to the Pacific Net and Twine Company, later merged into Pacific Marine Supply Company. In the 1950s through early 60s, Pier 59 was the home of Puget Sound Tug & Barge. Crowley moved the operations to the Duwamish Waterway in the 1960s.
The two "stubby" piers known as the Fish and Salt Docks (later Piers 60 and 61) were purchased by the Port of Seattle in the mid-1940s, and were removed in 1975 to make room for the Seattle Aquarium. Prior to acquisition by the Port, they had housed the Whiz Fish Company and the Palace Fish Company.
Pier 62 (built in 1901) and Pier 63 (built in 1905) have long since lost their sheds, which were similar to the one on Pier 59. Pier 62 was originally numbered Pier 9, known as the Gaffney Dock, after its absentee owner Mary Gaffney. Pier 63 (originally Pier 10) was known by 1908 as the Holden Dock, but was more commonly known as the Virginia Dock or Virginia Street Dock from its location. It was designed by architect Max Umbrecht and one of its main tenants in the 1910s was Northwest Fisheries, who canned and distributed Alaskan red salmon. An overpass connected the dock to a warehouse on the other side of Railroad Avenue. For many years after the city acquired these two piers in 1989 (in a trade with a private company for Pier 57), they were the venue for the Summer Nights at the Pier concert series, but the "aged and deteriorating" piers can no longer handle the weight of a stage and a crowd. As of 2006, the city is considering plans to replace these piers.
Bell Street Pier, Edgewater hotel, and Port headquarters.
Pier 66 is the official designation for the Port of Seattle's Bell Street Pier and Bell Harbor complex, which replaced historic Piers 64, 65, and 66 in the mid-1990s. Facilities at the Bell Street facility include a marina, a cruise ship terminal, a conference center, the Odyssey Maritime Discovery Center, restaurants, and marine services. A pedestrian elevator and overpass at Bell Street connects it to the upland World Trade Center (another Port of Seattle property), as well as to a parking lot and to Belltown in general. The area once was a shantytown. Cleared around 1903 in conjunction with the regrading of Denny Hill, it became home to the Pacific Coast Company's Orient Dock, which ran parallel to the shoreline rather than at the usual northeast-southwest angle. The southern portion of that dock was sometimes referred to as Pier D. By the 1920s, the Orient Dock was replaced by two "finger piers" running at the usual angles. These Lenora Street Piers (Piers 64 and 65) were used by the "Princess Ships" of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Leslie Salt Co. The Port of Seattle's original Bell Street Pier, the previous Pier 66, was built here in 1914 on dirt from the Denny Regrade. Despite the Thomson/Cotterill plan, the Orient Dock and the both the old and new Bell Street Pier were built parallel to the shore. There was a bridge on the site of the present-day pedestrian overpass.
Pier 67, renamed from Galbraith-Bacon Pier or Vine Street Pier in World War II, is the site of The Edgewater hotel (originally and briefly the "Camelot", and for many years the "Edgewater Inn"). The hotel has hosted numerous celebrities over the years, most famously the Beatles who came to Seattle in 1964 during the height of Beatlemania. Pier 68 (the Booth Fisheries Pier) was demolished at the time the hotel was built on the newly reconstructed Pier 67. 
Pier 69, north of Pier 67 and roughly between Vine and Clay Streets, is the site of the Port of Seattle headquarters and the Seattle terminus of the Victoria Clipper, a foot passenger (walk-on only) ferry with regular service to the Inner Harbour in Victoria, British Columbia. Although very heavily remodeled, the pier traces its history in part to Pier 13, built by the Roslyn Coal and Coke Company (1900), which also had a warehouse across Alaskan Way in the early 20th century. The warehouse was torn down to build the American Can Company building (headquarters of RealNetworks since 2008), which had an overpass to the pier in the 1930s.
Pier 70.
Pier 70, at the foot of Clay and Broad Streets, now marks the northern end of the Central Waterfront. Beyond that are the Olympic Sculpture Park and Myrtle Edwards Park. Although the pier shed retains its historic shape, it was remodeled after a fire in 1915, remodeled again in the 1970s, and so heavily altered in the late 1990s—reclad with metal siding, all windows and doors modernized and many reconfigured—that (unlike the old Northern Pacific piers) it retains only traces of its historic character.
The pier was built as Pier 14 by Ainsworth and Dunn and completed in 1902 along with a warehouse across Railroad Avenue (today's Alaskan Way) that is now the Old Spaghetti Factory. Ainsworth and Dunn's Seattle Fish Company dated from 1889 and occupied a succession of Central Waterfront locations. Beginning with a retail operation on higher ground at Second Avenue and Pike Street, they established themselves on the waterfront at the foot of Seneca Street by 1893, expanded their business to include grain and feed, and built Pier 8 / Pier 59 (though not its current pier shed) in 1896. By that time they had canning operations in Seattle and at Blaine, Washington. Eventually they moved their entire operation to Blaine, but they owned of Pier 14 until at least 1920, taking on a succession of tenants. In 1905, the main tenant was the Puget Sound Wharf and Warehouse Company, in 1912, the American and Hawaiian Steamship Company and in 1920, the Dodwell Dock and Warehouse Company, operating it as a terminal for the Northland Steamship Company and the Blue Funnel Line. The Washington State Liquor Control Board used the pier as a warehouse during World War II, after which The Coast Guard used the pier as its Seattle base from 1946 to 1955, and visiting naval vessels moored on its north side.
Like the piers to it south, its historic uses were superseded by containerization, and it was remodeled to house shops and restaurants. Triad Development bought the pier in 1995, and in the late 1990s it was remodeled as a headquarters for Go2Net, which was merged into InfoSpace, and fared poorly in the 2000–2001 crash that followed the dot-com bubble. Immediately before that remodel, in 1998 "" was filmed there. Because the Central Waterfront piers are not zoned residential, the building was officially a 24-hour-a-day film set for the shoot.
Across Alaskan Way.
Several buildings on the inland side of Alaskan Way have strong maritime associations. For example, as mentioned above, the building that now houses the Old Spaghetti Factory was built in conjunction with Pier 14, now Pier 70. Southeast from there, across Clay Street, the building that is now the headquarters of RealNetworks and also houses part of the Art Institute of Seattle began life in 1916 as the American Can Company, and in the 1930s was connected to Pier 69 by a skybridge. Continuing south across Vine Street is the former Booth Fisheries Building. Even farther inland, across Elliott Way from the Booth Fisheries Building, three former cannery worker cottages survive.
Another example is the Agen Warehouse, also known as Olympic Cold Storage Warehouse, at the corner of Western Avenue and Seneca Street near the downtown piers. Designed by architect John Graham and built in 1910, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It originally housed John Agen's Alaska Butter and Cream Company, which moved from Pier 6 (now Pier 57). Immediately north of that is another Graham building, built in 1918 as a warehouse for the Pacific Net and Twine Company. That company merged with the Marine Supply Company to form the Pacific Marine Supply Company, which continued to use the warehouse in conjunction with its operations on the old Pier 1 at the foot of Yesler Way. More recently, the building has been associated with genetic engineering company Immunex.
History.
Early native villages.
The history of human activity on what is now Seattle's Central Waterfront predates the settlement that became the city of Seattle. The Duwamish had a winter village of approximately 8 longhouses roughly at the intersection of First Avenue South and Yesler Way. With about 200 people, it was one of the most sizable villages along Elliott Bay. Its name, "Djicjila'letc" ("little crossing-over place") is still used by the Duwamish today.
Farther north, at the foot of Bell Street, was a ravine with another Duwamish encampment, "Ba'qbaqwab" ("little prairies"). It may have constituted a route to the prairie that extended between Queen Anne Hill and the former Denny Hill, including the site of the present Seattle Center. Two longhouses took advantage of a spring. By around the 1860s, the longhouses were gone, but modest beach structures remained.
There were also burial grounds roughly at the foot of Seneca Street. There appears to have been a smaller later burial ground just north of "Ba'qbaqwab", possibly dating from when the larger settlement at "Djicjila'letc" had been pre-empted by white settlers.
Chief Seattle's daughter Princess Angeline continued to live on the central waterfront until the end of her life (she died in 1896). It is not known exactly where her beach shack stood, but photos indicate that it was somewhere just north of the present-day Pike Hill Climb. Also into the 1890s, the Duwamish camped on Ballast Island at the foot of Washington Street in the present-day Pioneer Square neighborhood. The mound had been created from ballast and other material dumped by ships. In the late 1890s, Ballast Island was planked over as part a continuation of Railroad Avenue south of Yesler Way. Later, it was dredged and became part of the harbor.
19th century development.
Henry Yesler established his steam-powered sawmill at the foot of Mill Road (now Yesler Way) in October 1852. That mill and its wharf were, for several decades, the most important structures on the waterfront. The wharf became a transportation hub.
The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (SLS&ER) was the first to run a rail line along the water, in 1887, with a depot near the foot of Columbia Street on Western Avenue. The SLS&ER was eventually purchased by the Northern Pacific Railway. James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway eventually laid track even farther to the water side. Railroad Avenue, the route of both railways, was wide and built mainly on pilings over tideflats. The rail lines came from the south and, until 1893, went no farther north than Smith Cove, a short distance north of the Central Waterfront.
The Great Seattle Fire (June 6, 1889) obliterated Yesler's Wharf and all other waterfront structures south of Union Street. The one major wharf remaining after the fire was the Schwabacher Dock (also known as Schwabacher Wharf or Schwabacher's Wharf), just north of the "burnt district". Within four years after the fire, there was enormous redevelopment west of Front Street (now First Avenue), with an 1893 Sanborn insurance map showing West Street, now Western Avenue, running the entire length of the present Central Waterfront (and then some, continuing northwest into what is now Myrtle Edwards Park), and Water Street (now Elliott Avenue) running more or less along what was then the shore from Bell Street to Broad Street; filling has subsequently moved that shore west. There were numerous docks, mostly perpendicular to the shore. The Sanborn map indicates the nature of the businesses along the waterfront, and suggests that fishing had not yet become an important industry at this time. More typical waterfront uses were warehouses for grain and feed. Just inland from the water were many hotels, ranging from workingmen's hotels to a "Grand Hotel" on Front Street between Madison and Marion Streets. 
Prior to Washington statehood in 1889, the question of title to the tidelands was entirely unclear. Yesler and others had built onto the tidelands regardless of this legal limbo. The number of these "tideland jumpers" increased up as statehood approached. Officially, the federal government held the tidelands in trust for the future state, and all such activities—which included the construction of railways—were technically illegal. The new state constitution fashioned a compromise measure: the state generally affirmed its own ownership of tidelands, but provided for case-by-case exceptions to be adjudicated by the courts. In many cases, adjudication had to be made between upland owners and those who had built on pilings on the tidelands. Constitutional provisions were also made for state-owned harbors with zones along the shore reserved for "landings, wharves and streets and other conveniences of navigation and commerce." All this was later modified to allow towns and municipalities to gain more control of their own shorelines, setting the stage for coherent plans for development and reclamation. 
The arrangement of the "finger" piers on the Central Waterfront, each more or less a parallelogram, dates from an 1897 plan. Their uniform northeast-southwest direction was prescribed by city engineer Reginald H. Thomson and his assistant George F. Cotterill. Most earlier piers, none of which survive, formed a perfect right angle to the shore; the present piers do not. Thomson and Cotterill's arrangement spared freight trains from needing to make a sharp right angle and prevented piers from potentially running into one another where the shoreline curved.
Heyday, stagnation, and revival.
Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Seattle's Central waterfront was the bustling center of one of North America's major ports. The needs of the waterfront created a district of light industrial uses and workingmen's hotels. The waterfront was a focus of the conflicting agendas of big business, radical labor unionists such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), Populists, and middle-class Progressive reformers such as the Municipal Ownership League led by George Cotterill. The Progressives achieved one of their most cherished goals when the Port of Seattle, the first municipal corporation in the United States, was established in 1911, with elected port commissioners. Despite that victory, for the next several decades and even, to a lesser extent, today, much of the Central Waterfront remained in private hands.
The Port Commission nonetheless had an enormous impact shortly after its inception. Their original Bell Street Pier (1914; "see below") established a significant presence on the waterfront. However, as Seattle became a particularly successful port during World War I, the Port Commission became increasingly the captive of business interests. Seattle prospered as a port in the 1920s, especially through increased trade with Japan, importing such goods as soybean oil and raw silk. The soybean oil had an important local industrial use: in 1923, I. F. Laucks invented his waterproof "Lauxein" glue. Made from soybeans, it was used heavily by the region's plywood industry.
Shipping lines with facilities on Central Waterfront piers in the 1920s included local steamer companies, but also the Grand Trunk Pacific Steamship Company, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, the East Asiatic Steamship Company, the Cosmos Line, the Osaka Shoshen Kaisha, the Hamburg America Line, the Blue Funnel Line, and such mercantile tenants as Seattle Pacific Marine Supply and W. R. Grace and Company.
Although Seattle was hit hard by the Great Depression, development of the Central Waterfront did not come to a complete halt. Former livery stables continued to be converted to garages, the Black Ball Line brought a striking Art Deco motif to Colman Dock, and Gorst Air Transport operated seaplanes. The American Can Company built its massive building across from Pier 69, and the seawall was greatly extended in 1934.
During World War II, 29 shipyards operated in Seattle, though none of them on the Central Waterfront. This period also saw the introduction of fork lifts and pallets to move cargo. These marked the beginning of a change in shipping and quayside technology that would render the old piers obsolete. In 1946, E. H. Savage, president of the Port Commission, proposed demolishing the "Gold Rush period" piers and put forth the first of several schemes for "modern reinforced concrete structures, providing longitudinal mooring parallel to Alaskan Way", suitable for "large ocean-going vessels." These schemes were not adopted, and in the 1950s Seattle was a port in decline. The Port of Seattle had come to own most of the over-water structures on the Central Waterfront, but for the most part such shipping traffic as Seattle retained was using other piers and docks. Furthermore, construction of the Alaskan Way Viaduct in the early 1950s placed a visual barrier and a partial physical barrier between much of the Central Waterfront and the rest of Downtown.
With maritime activity moving elsewhere, especially to the new container port south of the Central Waterfront, people began to consider the potential importance of the Central Waterfront as a tourist destination. At the beginning of 1960, the only specifically tourist-oriented businesses on the Central Waterfront piers were Ye Olde Curiosity Shop (founded in 1899) and Ivar Haglund's Acre of Clams restaurant (founded in 1938). Another restaurant, the Cove, opened that year. Most of the plans proposed in this era foresaw demolishing all or nearly all of the historic piers. (In this same era, there were many proposals to demolish large numbers of Pioneer Square buildings, as well.) Proposed to take their place were such things as a sea circus, an aquarium, hotels and motels, a park, a marina, a heliport, a convention center, shops, restaurants, office buildings, and high rise apartments. One hotel, now The Edgewater, was built in 1962–63. Some of the visions from this era also included marine-supply stores, mooring for historic ships and a maritime museum. There was already criticism of the Alaskan Way Viaduct: architect Ibsen Nelson called it a "major built-in problem".
Tangible signs of revival began in the 1960s and accelerated in the 1970s and '80s. Several piers were reworked to contain shops and restaurants. Ted Griffin's Seattle Marine Aquarium was located on the western end of Pier 56 from 1962 to 1976, succeeded by the current Seattle Aquarium on Pier 59. All of these were achieved while preserving historic pier shed structures. The space once occupied by the Schwabacher Wharf, vacant for decades, became Waterfront Park. Also in this era, many historic buildings nearby on land were rehabilitated; several received city or federal historic designations. The bars and taverns along First Avenue "considered decrepit by some and colorful by others," gave way to new developments such as the Watermark Tower.
The future.
While the many thwarted plans of the 1960s may constitute a warning about prognostication, the city has adopted an official Waterfront Concept Plan. The planning process behind this document began in 2003 and centered on a 300-person Visioning Charrette in February 2004, the largest event of its kind in the city's history. Aside from the city's process, plans are under consideration for major work at the Washington State Ferry terminal and the Seattle Aquarium; the Olympic Sculpture Park has already transformed the northern end of the Central Waterfront.
Some things about the future of the Central Waterfront are clear. The 2001 Nisqually earthquake revealed that the Alaskan Way Viaduct is unsound and the seawall is in very poor condition. Another earthquake could cause liquefaction of the soils, undermining the viaduct and placing massive pressure on the seawall. While there may be much question as to what will happen, there is no doubt that things cannot remain as they are. Elsewhere on the waterfront, the deteriorating Piers 62 and 63 also cannot remain as they are.
As of 2008, the Washington State Department of Transportation is considering eight different scenarios for replacing the viaduct's Central Waterfront section. These include three different surface road options, two viaduct options (one with a park level over the traffic level), a bored tunnel, a cut-and-cover tunnel, and a lidded roadway. The city's Department of Parks and Recreation is considering five different alternatives for replacing Piers 62 and 63, some of them integrated with specific replacement plans for the viaduct. The issue of what will replace the viaduct also figures prominently in the city's own planning process.

Macchi M.24

__NOTOC__
The Macchi M.24 was a flying boat produced in Italy during the 1920s. Originally intended as a bomber, it was eventually produced for civilian use as well. The M.24 resembled a scaled-up version of earlier Macchi flying boat bombers such as the M.9 and M.18, sharing their biplane configuration and Warren truss-style interplane struts. However, while these earlier aircraft were single-engine types, the M.24 had twin engines mounted in a tractor-pusher pair on struts in the interplane gap. Also like the M.18, it featured an open position in the bow for a gunner, but added a second such position amidships as well.
Two M.24s made a demonstration flight in 1925 from Macchi's home on Lake Varese, crossing the Alps to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Leningrad and home again. This feat was followed by torpedo-launching experiments. The M.24 saw extensive use with the Italian Navy, and several were purchased by the Spanish Navy.
A civil version with equal-span wings was developed in 1927 as the M.24"bis". This featured an enclosed cabin within the forward hull that could seat eight passengers. "Aero Espresso" flew these on its Brindisi-Athens-Constantinople route, and SITA operated them on routes in the Mediterranean as well.

Shay's Warehouse and Stable

Building
The building consists of two connected two-story sections: a square warehouse and rectangular stable. They are built into a slight slope and only the west (main) elevation is fully exposed. It has a stone foundation giving way to brick laid in common bond rising to a low-pitched tin hipped roof with an unusual brick-corbeled cornice and a few arched dormer windows.
Inside, both sections are almost intact. The warehouse's floors are both open, with its upper floor supported by randomly spaced joists supported by heavy beams at the center. In the stable, the tack room and stalls have been removed to make space for contemporary automotive uses but other than that there have been no changes.
There are no outbuildings related to its original use surviving. Shay's house is also on the parcel, but it has undergone considerable change since it was built and is not considered contributing.
History.
Shay bought the Main Street-Point Street corner property around 1863. His house is shown on maps of the village from the next decade, but not the warehouse. It probably existed as it was not the custom of mapmakers of the time to show outbuildings. He used it for storage and transshipment of rags and cotton waste from the mills in Wappingers Falls.
In later years it would see other uses as New Hamburg changed due to the decline in commercial traffic along the Hudson River and the later rise and fall of the railroad over the 20th century. It would be a cooperage for apple barrels and a brass foundry. The stable was modified as cars replaced horses. At the time of its listing on the National Register it was a boat-repair shop, reflecting the nearby marinas that now dominate the hamlet's economy.
More recently it has been used just for storage. It is today the only intact surviving commercial or industrial building from New Hamburg's days as a river port.
Aesthetics.
Like the nearby duplex Shay built, the warehouse (stable) is very ornamented for a vernacular industrial or related building from that period in the Poughkeepsie area. Unlike the duplex, built five years later, its basic style is Italianate, as evidenced by the blocky forms and arched windows. But the decoration, particularly the corbeled brick, suggests an attempt to interpret the Picturesque mode popularized in mid-century.

Languages of Burkina Faso

Burkina Faso is a multilingual country. An estimated 69 languages are spoken there, of which about 60 are indigenous. The Mossi language () is spoken by about 40%, mainly in the central region around the capital, Ouagadougou, along with other, closely related Gurunsi languages scattered throughout Burkina. In the west Mande languages are widely spoken. The language of the Fulfulde people (, ) is widespread, particularly in the north.
The official language is French, which was introduced during the colonial period. French is the principal language of administrative, political and judicial institutions, public services, and the press. It is the only language for laws, administration and courts.
Education for the deaf in Burkina uses American Sign Language, introduced by the deaf American missionary Andrew Foster, though there is also an indigenous urban sign language in Ouagadougou.

Recombination signal sequences

The regional genes (V, D, J), used to generate T-cell receptors and Immunoglobulin molecules, are flanked by recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that are recognized by a group of enzymes known collectively as the VDJ recombinase. RSSs are composed of seven conserved nucleotides (a heptamer) that reside next to the gene encoding sequence followed by a spacer (containing either 12 or 23 unconserved nucleotides) followed by a conserved nonamer (9 base pairs). The RSSs are present on the 3’ side (downstream) of a V region and the 5’ side (upstream) of the J region. These are the sides that will be involved in the joining. Only a pair of dissimilar spacer RSSs are efficiently recombined (i.e. one with a spacer of 12 nucleotides will be recombined with one that has a spacer containing 23 nucleotides). This is known as the 12/23 rule of recombination (or the one-turn/two-turn rule).

<doc id="19853131" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19853131" title="Wireless Hill">
Wireless Hill

Wireless Hill is a steep-sided hill with a summit plateau that takes up most of the North Head promontory at the northern end of Australia’s subantarctic Macquarie Island, lying in the Southern Ocean about halfway between Australia and Antarctica. Its highest point is about 100 m above sea level and it is joined to the main body of the island by a low and narrow isthmus that is occasionally wave-washed in heavy storms. Macquarie Island Station, operated by the Australian Antarctic Division and the only permanently populated place on the island, lies at the northern end of the isthmus at the foot of Wireless Hill. The hill is so named because it was the site of an early wireless telegraphy relay station, part of the first radio link to Antarctica.
Wireless Hill radio station.
Headed by meteorologist George Ainsworth, the radio station was established as part of the 1911-1914 Australasian Antarctic Expedition led by Douglas Mawson in order to provide a radio link between the expedition’s main Antarctic base at Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, and Hobart, Tasmania. It comprised a radio shack, an engine room and transmission masts erected at the top of the hill. The equipment used was German-made Telefunken 1.5 kW spark transmitters, with power for radio transmission coming from a De Dion-Bouton engine.
The expedition telegraphists on Macquarie Island, Arthur Sawyer and Charles Sandell, used morse code operated on high frequency. The first transmission of the station was made to another receiver on the island on 17 January 1912. The first communication between the island and the outside world took place on 13 February 1912, with Sydney radio and with shipping. The station subsequently sent daily weather reports to Wellington, New Zealand. Communication with Commonwealth Bay was finally established in April 1913. In 1913 control of the station was handed over to the Australian Meteorological Service, which continued to operate it until 1915 when meteorological observations were discontinued. The site and the equipment were then abandoned until 1948 when the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions established a permanent presence on the island.

Colin Sargent

Colin Sargent, PhD is an American author and playwright. His best known works include his novel "Museum of Human Beings", included in the National American Indian Heritage Month Booklist, which delves into the heart-wrenching life of Jean-Baptiste Charbonneau, the son of Sacagawea; the play "100 Percent American Girl;" and poetry books "Luftwaffe Snowshoes", "Blush", and "Undertow." He is the founding Editor and Publisher of "Portland Magazine", "Maine's City Magazine." Media Bistro has singled out "Portland Magazine" for its extraordinary perspective as one of the best regional magazines in the country.
Background.
Colin Sargent was born in Portland, Maine, on November 5, 1954. Sargent edited the Navy's "Approach Magazine" after graduating from the United States Naval Academy in 1977. In 1985, Sargent became the founding editor and publisher of "Portland Magazine", also known as "Maine's City Magazine," or "Portland Monthly", in Portland, Maine. He wrote the play "100 Percent American Girl" and later wrote his first novel, "Museum of Human Beings", published in 2009.
Sargent is a former member of the board of trustees of Maine Reads, the statewide literacy organization led by Maine First Lady Karen Baldacci. He earned his MFA in Creative Writing from the Stonecoast MFA Writing Program. 
Sargent earned his Ph.D. in Creative Writing at Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK in 2013. Dr. Sargent successfully defended his dissertation, the novel "Hiding Nothing", with a companion exegesis "The Negative Mirror."  His research is in cognitive literary studies that explore reading as an out-of-body experience. 
Accomplishments.
Colin Sargent was the winner of a Maine Individual Artist Fellowship in Literature presented by the Maine Arts Commission. His play "100 Percent American Girl," is about the imagined return of World War II radio propagandist Axis Sally (a.k.a. Mildred Sisk and Mildred Gillars) to a modern congregate care facility in her old hometown—where some retired GIs' ears prick up at the sound of her voice. It was a winner at the Maine Playwrights Festival and was produced at the Maine Festival and Arts Conservatory Theater and Studio (ACTS).
His first book of poetry was "Luftwaffe Snowshoes" (Portsmouth Arts Center), followed by "Blush" and "Undertow", both published by Coyote Love Press. "Undertow" earned Pick of the Month notice in "Small Press Review". According to "Poet Lore": “Reading Colin Sargent’s poetry is like opening a dark bag and having a thread leap out, then several more threads fusing to luminous bands of music, one after another, along with crazy potatoes, a phone growing like a black plant, perhaps a soda can discarded on the beach off Kennebunkport, Maine. In Undertow, his latest book, Sargent’s collocations of the magical and the mundane work together brilliantly.”
In 2009, Sargent's novel "Museum of Human Beings" was published by McBooks. "Publishers Weekly" observed and noted, “Playwright Sargent’s debut novel is a stylish look at the fate of Sacagawea’s baby son, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau… An impressively rounded portrait of the laid-back, introspective, nomadic Baptiste, this novel will satisfy fans of American history.” According to Library Journal, "From the beginning to the novel's spellbinding conclusion, playwright and poet Sargent allows us an intimate glimpse into what could have been the heart of Jean-Baptiste. This memorable novel will captivate all who read it. Highly recommended for all public library historical fiction collections."

Marcus Cooper

Marcus Cooper (born February 1, 1990) is an American football cornerback for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the 7th round of the 2013 NFL Draft, with the 252nd overall pick. He played college football for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights.
College career.
Cooper played all four years for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, but saw limited playing time as a starter during his first two seasons as a Wide Receiver. He switched to Cornerback in his final year at Rutgers and his playing time increased immensely along with his production, leading many draft experts to speculate that he would be a mid-late NFL draft pick.
Professional career.
San Francisco 49ers.
On April 27, Cooper was drafted in seventh round of the 2013 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers with the 252nd overall selection. On May 10, 2013 it was announced that Cooper had signed a four-year contract with the 49ers. Cooper was then cut by the 49ers in their final roster cuts before the beginning of the 2013 regular season.
Kansas City Chiefs.
The Kansas City Chiefs claimed Cooper off waivers right after the deadline to reach 53 players in 2013 and added him to their active roster. Upon a minor injury to CB Brandon Flowers, Cooper played extensively against the NY Giants on 9/29/13. Against the Tennessee Titans he also earned significant playing time, recovering a fumble in the endzone for a Chiefs' touchdown in the first quarter. He won the Mack Lee award at the end of the 2013 season for being the most productive rookie in the Kansas City Chiefs roster.

Alice Yen-Ping Ting is Taiwanese-born American chemist. She is an associate professor in the department of chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Alice Ting was born in Taiwan and emigrated to the United States when she was three years old. She was raised in Texas and attended the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science (TAMS). In 1991, she attended the prestigious Research Science Institute. She received her BS in Chemistry from Harvard in 1996, working with Nobel laureate E.J. Corey. She completed her Ph.D. with Peter G. Schultz from University of California, Berkeley in 2000. She completed her postdoctoral fellowship with 2008 Nobel Laureate Roger Y. Tsien.
She joined the MIT Chemistry Department in 2002 where she is now an Ellen Swallow Richards Associate Professor. Her research harnesses the power of natural enzymes to help image protein function in living cells. She has received a number of awards, including a 2008 NIH Director's Pioneer Award and a 2010 Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society.
In February 2013, "Cell" retracted a 2010 report by Ting about a technique for creating images of interactions on living nerve cells at Ting's request. Ting's retraction noted that method in the paper could not be duplicated and said the data from a post-doc was faked. At the same time, Ting published a paper with a revised version of the method that is claimed to work better. The timeline of the retraction from Cell in 2013, the submission of the revised paper to PLOS in 2013, and the omission of the subsequently retracted paper from the Ting laboratory website since the fall of 2011, subjected Ting to criticism from the scientific community.

Robert T. Smith

Robert Tharp (R.T.) Smith (February 23, 1918 – August 21, 1995) was born in York, Nebraska. His family moved to Red Cloud from Hooper, Nebraska in 1927 when his father, Earl W. Smith, was hired as Superintendent of Schools. He graduated Red Cloud High School in 1935. Smith attended the University of Nebraska before joining the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1939, midway through his senior year.
Flight training.
He received his primary flight training at the Allan Hancock College of Aeronautics at Santa Maria, California. During his training, he was given a couple of check rides with Robert L. Scott, who on May 17, 1942 flew as Smith's wingman on Scott's first combat mission in China. Smith completed basic training with Class 40-C at Randolph Field, Texas and advanced training at Brooks Field, Texas. He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in June 1940, and returned to Randolph Field where his first assignment was as a basic flight instructor.
American Volunteer Group.
Smith resigned his commission in July 1941 in order to join Colonel Claire Lee Chennault's American Volunteer Group (AVG) as a "soldier of fortune" with the Nationalist Chinese Air Force. The Flying Tigers, as they were soon to be called, were in Burma training in Curtiss P-40s (actually Hawk Model 81-A-2s, or, as the British called them, Tomahawks) when Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941 (December 8 on their side of the International Dateline).
R.T. Smith (sometimes called "Tadpole" after David Lee "Tex" Hill supplied the answer to a question someone posed to Smith, “What’s the ‘T’ stand for?”) saw his first combat action over Rangoon on December 23, 1941, when he was credited with shooting down 1.5 Mitsubishi Ki-21 "Sally" bombers followed on Christmas Day with credit for two more Sally bombers and a fighter. Promoted to flight leader in the Third Pursuit Squadron, "Hell's Angels", Smith was credited with shooting down a total of 8.9 Japanese planes, and was twice decorated by the Chinese government. The AVG continued to fight throughout Burma and southwest China until it was officially disbanded on July 4, 1942.
1st Air Commando Group.
Smith returned to the United States on the "USAT Mariposa" along with 82 other AVG pilots and ground personnel. Prior to being drafted as a private in December 1942, Smith served as the Technical Advisor on "The Sky’s the Limit" directed by E.H. Griffith and starring Fred Astaire and Joan Leslie. The side of the P-40 Astaire is flying at the beginning of the movie has a sitting Hell’s Angel of the AVG’s Third Squadron that was on the side of Smith’s P-40 #77. After being drafted, Smith was quickly recommissioned as a U.S. Air Corps Second lieutenant and promoted to Major the next month. For the next few months, as Commanding Officer of the 337 Fighter Squadron, 329 Fighter Group at Glendale, California and Paine Field, Everett, Washington, he trained replacement pilots using Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter aircraft. Smith married Barbara Bradford in June 1943, adopting her son Brad from a previous marriage to vaudeville performer George Mann.
Shortly after being appointed Commanding Officer of the 329th Fighter Group in September 1943, he volunteered to return to the China-India-Burma Theater with the 1st Air Commando Group, flying occasional P-51 Mustang missions and commanding that group's B-25 Mitchell squadron in support of British General Orde Wingate's troops working out of India and moving behind Japanese lines in Burma (now Myanmar). The story is told of when Smith was flying alone in his P-51 (named "Barbie" after his wife) and saw a crowd gathered around a jeep on the flying field. Someone was making a speech and Smith assumed it was Phil Cochran, Co-commander (with John Alison) of the 1st Air Commando Group. He put his P-51 into a dive and buzzed the speaker, nearly taking his hat off, at over 450 miles an hour. It was only after Smith landed that he learned the speaker was Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia. Lord Mountbatten wasn't angry at Smith, but was angry at his aide for having him make a speech on an active flying field. Smith ("R.T." according to Chuck Baisden, for "Round Trip" while in the 1st Air Commando Group) was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in March 1944, flew 55 combat missions over Burma, and was awarded the Air Medal, Distinguished Flying Cross and Silver Star.
After discharge.
Smith returned to the States in the late spring of 1944 and was assigned as Director of Flying Training with the 441st Army Air Force Base Unit at Van Nuys, California, a P-38 training base. The Base Operations Officer at the time was Major Barry Goldwater. He resigned from the Air Corps at the conclusion of World War II and bought a home in the San Fernando Valley in Southern California across from the Los Angeles River when it was actually a river instead of the concrete channel it is today. After flying DC3s and Constellations between Los Angeles and Kansas City for a year and a half with Trans-World Airlines (TWA), he wrote radio scripts for the Hopalong Cassidy Western Adventure Show, Lum and Abner, The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show, and the Clyde Beatty Show. He also wrote the screenplay (with Frank Taussig) for the movie "Perils of the Jungle" starring Clyde Beatty. Smith was co-owner of a toy manufacturing company (Smith-Miller); developed and sold a product for conditioning automobile convertible tops (Top Secret); and worked for Roy Weatherby as a sales manager for Weatherby's Inc. A check on eBay will disclose that Smith-Miller trucks have become expensive collector’s items. R.T. and Barbara Smith were divorced in 1955. About this time Smith joined Lockheed Aircraft Corporation as a technical writer, working his way up through the organization, first as a military sales representative for the F-104 Starfighter, and later to open and manage a new corporate office for Lockheed in Newport News, Virginia. Smith served at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Air Force Reserve from 1949 to 1966.
R.T. Smith married Ronni Burkett in July 1965. During the late 1960s, he joined the Flying Tiger Line, first as Vice President for Industrial Affairs in Washington, D.C. and later as Vice President for the Far East headquartered in Tokyo. He left the Flying Tiger Line and Tokyo in the early 1970s to live and work in Palm Springs, California.
R.T. Smith and Ronni were divorced in the mid-1970s. He returned to the San Fernando Valley where he wrote and published "Tale of a Tiger", based on facsimiles of his original diary entries and several articles for "Air Classics". He also established a mail-order business, selling his book and color photographs he shot while he was in the AVG and 1st Air Commando Group, including this often reproduced formation shot of the 3rd Squadron Hell's Angels taken on May 28, 1942 near the Salween River along the China-Burma border. He died at age 77 (the number he selected for his first P-40 in the AVG) of lung cancer on August 21, 1995.
Smith was survived by his sister, June, who died in 2001; three sons, Bradford, Robert, and William; and three grandchildren. William Reed Smith is named in honor of his good friend Bill Reed, who died in December 1944 while serving with the Chinese-American Composite Wing.

Jin Zhiyang

Jin Zhiyang (Simplified Chinese: 金志扬, born January 10, 1944) is a Chinese football coach and a former football player. He is mainly noted within China for his loyal service towards Beijing as both a successful player and then later as a coach for the team where his greatest achievements was when he managed the team to two Chinese FA Cup titles in the 1996 and then 1997 league seasons. He has also managed several other teams such as Tibet, Tianjin Teda and China on a caretaker basis, while his last senior coaching position was with Beijing Institute of Technology FC.
Playing career.
Jin Zhiyang started his playing career with the Beijing youth team and subsequently the senior Beijing team. His greatest achievement came when he won the national league title in 1973 with the Beijing team. He would retire shortly afterwards to begin his management career.
Coaching career.
After he retired from football Jin Zhiyang would begin coaching for the Beijing team before he was offered a chance to become the Head coach of Tibet in 1974. After staying with them for two season he would return to Beijing where he was offered the chance to coach the youth team and then the reserves until March 1985 when the club pushed for professionalism within the team and moved Jin to Germany to study professional coaching before returning to Beijing where he continued studying before finally achieving his coaching badges. After the previous Head coach Tang Pengju had a disappointing season with Beijing, Jin was promoted as the club's manager at the beginning of the 1995 league season and would immediately transform the team into genuine title contenders, achieving a runners-up position at the end of the season. While he couldn't go on to win the league title he would go on to win the 1996 and then 1997 Chinese FA Cup titles. Near the end of the 1997 Chinese league season the Chinese Football Association would hire a foreign coach in Bob Houghton to manage the Chinese football team and Jin Zhiyang was brought in as an assistant coach to help him. This lasted until December 2008 when recently promoted top tier side Tianjin Teda F.C. offered him their head coach position, taking this opportunity to return into management he would lead them at the start of the 1999 league season to a respectable seventh place position at the end of the season. In 2000 Jin would return to the Chinese football team as their manager, but on only on a part-time caretaker basis to aid the team prepare for some important 2000 AFC Asian Cup qualification games. When he returned to Tianjin Teda F.C. he would once again achieve similar mid-table results from the previous season and leave the club at the end year.

Boy Blue (Electric Light Orchestra song)

"Boy Blue" is a song written by Jeff Lynne and performed by the Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) which first appeared as track number 3 from their 1974 album "Eldorado". 
The album version of the song starts with a Baroque-style brass fanfare – reminiscent of Jeremiah Clarke's "Prince of Denmark's March" (ca. 1700) — and then develops into a minimoog sequence before the song properly begins. The song includes a midway solo of the band's three string players. At the end of the song the string instruments quickly fade, immediately leading into the LP's fourth track "Laredo Tornado".
Bassist Mike de Albuquerque featured on the song but it is unknown just how many tracks he contributed to on the album as he left the band during the recording sessions.
""Mike de Albuquerque left the group after the recording session of Eldorado, on which" "his mighty voice could be heard for the last time on an E.L.O. record in the sixth" "verse of Boy Blue."" — Patrik Guttenbacher, Marc Haines, & Alexander von Petersdorff (1996 Unexpected Messages).
Story.
""A song about an all-conquering hero from the middle ages."" — Jeff Lynne ("Eldorado" Remaster, 2001).
The song is an anti-war song set during the Crusades and forms the second dream as part of the overall "Eldorado" dreamscape. It tells a story about a hero returning from a far off war and the rapturous welcome he received from his town folk. Boy Blue (the character of the song) rebuffs the hero worship and declares his hatred of war and stating his refusal to ever take up arms again.
The song was covered by the tribute album "Lynne Me Your Ears" by Rick Altizer. The US edited single version of this song is missing the fanfare intro, parts of the orchestral bridge, and the second to last chorus. The song was released as the second single from the "Eldorado" album but failed to chart.

Enterprise carbon accounting

Enterprise Carbon Accounting (ECA)/ Corporate Carbon Footprint aims to be a rapid and cost effective process for businesses to collect, summarise, and report enterprise and supply chain GHG inventories. ECA leverages financial accounting principles, whilst utilising a hybrid of input-output LCA (Life Cycle Analysis)and process methodologies as appropriate. The evolution to ECA is necessary to address the urgent need for a more comprehensive and scalable approach to carbon accounting. While an emerging area, a number of new companies offer ECA solutions. ECA is a critical part of broader Enterprise Sustainability Accounting.
Characteristics of ECA.
To be successful, an Enterprise Carbon Accounting system should have the following characteristics:
Comprehensive: Incorporates Scope 1,2 and 3 emissions
Periodic: Enables updates at regular intervals and comparisons across reporting periods
Auditable: Traces transactions and enables independent reviews for compliance
Flexible: Incorporates data from multiple approaches to life cycle analysis
Standards-Based: Accommodates existing generally accepted standards and emerging standards
Scalable: Accommodates growing volume and complexity of business operations
Efficient: Delivers data in the timeframe required for decision making
Enterprises that realize reduced emissions and energy consumption utilize systems with the following capabilities:
The Evolution of LCA to ECA.
Process LCA.
Process LCA is the most popular method, currently, for conducting life-cycle assessment, and is often referred to as the SETAC-EPA method because of the role played by SETAC and EPA in this method’s development. The inputs and outputs of multiple stages of a product’s life are investigated in turn, and the results are aggregated into single metrics of impact such as eutrophication, toxicity, and greenhouse gas emissions. Three tools exist on the market to assist researchers in conducting process LCA (such as GaBi, Ecoinvent, and Umberto). These tools contain data from previous researchers on the environmental impact of materials and processes that are then strung together by the user to form a system.
Economic Input-Output LCA.
Input-Output LCA utilizes economic input-output tables and industry-level environmental data to construct a database of environmental impacts per dollar sold by an industry. The boundary problem of process LCA is solved in this method because the economic input-output table captures the interrelations of all economic sectors; however, aggregated industrial categories limit the specificity of the results. Input–output analysis is a very powerful tool for the upfront screening of corporate carbon footprints, for informing streamlined supply-chain GHG accounting and for setting priorities for more detailed analyses.
Hybrid LCA.
Many methods for hybrid life-cycle assessments have been discussed, which aim to combine the infinite boundary of EIO-LCA with the specificity of Process LCA.
Enterprise Carbon Accounting (ECA).
At its core, ECA is essentially a hybrid life-cycle assessment; however, rather than the traditional bottom-up approach of life-cycle assessment, ECA links financial data directly to LCA data to produce a snapshot of the companies’ operations. Rather than probing at areas thought to be problematic, ECA quickly identifies problem areas in the supply chain so that rapid action can be taken. This fundamental shift in thinking enables decision makers to rapidly address critical areas within the enterprise and supply chain.
Socialised Supply Chain.
Socialised supply chain accounting is the term generally applied to Enterprise Carbon Accounting Solutions that provide a collaborative mechanism for supply chain participants to engage, expose and determine supply chain emissions through the process of shared knowledge. The term "Socialised Supply Chain" was coined by the CEO of Nootrol, Mark Kearns to describe a platform where supply chain participants exposed Process LCA and embedded emissions.

Uno Åhrén

Uno Åhrén (6 August 1897 Stockholm – 8 October 1977 Arvika) was a Swedish architect and city planner, and a leading proponent of Functionalism in Sweden. 
In 1930 Ahren was one of the designers for the Housing Exhibition of the Stockholm International Exhibition, and in 1931 he was one of the six co-authors of the "Acceptera!", or "Accept!", manifesto, a plea for acceptance of functionalism, standardization, and mass production as a cultural change in Sweden. 
Åhrén collaborated with the sociologist, reformer and Nobel Prize winner Gunnar Myrdal from 1932 though 1935 on a social housing commission, and in 1934 they co-authored "The Housing Question as a Social Planning Problem", a work that would prove influential in the structuring of the Social Democratic Swedish society, the Folkhemmet. In fact Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson, who coined the word Folkhemmet, himself moved into an Åhrén-designed functionalist house in 1936. 
From 1947 through 1963 he served as Professor of City Planning for the Technical University at Stockholm.

Louis Thomassin (archetier)

Louis Thomassin (1856–1905) was a French bow maker, or "Archetier".
He learned his craft in Mirecourt where he worked for the Bazin Family. In 1872 he went to Paris to work for François Nicolas Voirin and carried on Voirin's shop after his death. 
He established his own workshop in Paris in 1891. 
His son and pupil, Claude, also made fine bows in Paris, based on Voirin's model. 
Louis Thomassin's branded bows are of beautiful and of consistent quality. Unfortunately his production was not extensive.

Gambling Hangover

"Gambling Hangover" was the theme of an Australian social marketing campaign to help young male gamblers.
The campaign.
The two-year campaign was created by Sydney agency The Campaign Palace on behalf of the Responsible Gambling Fund, a part of the New South Wales Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing.
It targeted men aged 18-25 in the "morning after" phase following a gambling binge, when they were most likely to seek help for problem gambling. It identified the three main symptoms of a gambling hangover as "a sick feeling," "anxiety and regrets," and "not liking yourself."
Ads were placed where young men were likely to see them in the morning: in train stations, on buses, on morning radio, and in morning newspapers. Young men were urged to visit gamblinghangover.nsw.gov.au, to SMS for more information, or to call a helpline number if they recognised the gambling hangover symptoms in themselves.
Responses to the helpline and in follow-up research showed the phrase had moved into common usage among young men, and 50 percent of those surveyed were able to recall the campaign.

Puget Sound region

The Puget Sound region is an inland area of the Pacific Northwest in the U.S. state of Washington, including Puget Sound, the Puget Sound lowlands, and the surrounding region roughly west of the Cascade Range and east of the Olympic Mountains.
History.
The Puget Sound region was formed by the collision and attachment of many terranes ("microcontinents") to the North American Plate between about 50 to 10 million years ago. About 15,000 years ago, the Puget Sound region was covered by a lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The ice was about thick in the vicinity of Seattle. By the time Captain George Vancouver found the Sound, early native people had already been there for over 5,000 years.
Logging started as early as 1853. In the 1880s logging railroads cut their way into Puget Sound. 1886 the St. Helens fire burned . Mount Rainier National Park started in 1899. The 1902 Yacolt fire burned . Olympic National Park was established in 1938.
George Vancouver explored Puget sound in 1792. Vancouver claimed it for Great Britain on 4 June 1792, naming it for one of his officers, Lieutenant Peter Puget. It became part of the Oregon Country, and became U.S. territory when the 1846 Oregon Treaty was signed.
After arriving along the Oregon Trail, many settlers wandered north to what is now Washington and settled the Puget Sound area. The first non-indigenous settlement was New Market (now known as Tumwater) in 1846. In 1853 Washington Territory was formed from part of Oregon Territory. In 1888 the Northern Pacific railroad line reached Puget Sound, linking the region to eastern states.
For a long period Tacoma was noted for its large smelters where gold, silver, copper and lead ores were treated. Seattle was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country and for a time possessed a large shipbuilding industry. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including World War I and World War II, and the Boeing Company became an established icon in the area.
During World War II the Puget Sound area became a focus for the war industry, with Boeing producing many of the nation's heavy bombers and the ports of Seattle, Bremerton and Tacoma available for shipbuilding.
Since 1995, Puget Sound has been recognized as an American Viticultural Area by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.
Physical geography.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) defines Puget Sound as a bay with numerous channels and branches; more specifically, it is a fjord system of flooded glacial valleys. Puget Sound is part of a larger physiographic structure termed the Puget Trough, which is a physiographic section of the larger Pacific Border province, which in turn is part of the larger Pacific Mountain System.
Puget Sound is a large salt water estuary, or system of many estuaries, fed by highly seasonal freshwater from the Olympic and Cascade mountain watersheds. Puget Sound is connected to the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the north at Admiralty Inlet, between Point Partridge on Whidbey Island and Point Wilson on the Olympic Peninsula. A second connection is Deception Pass, between West Point on Whidbey Island and Rosario Head on Fidalgo Island.
Continental ice sheets have repeatedly advanced and retreated from the Puget Sound region. During the most recent glacial period, called the Fraser Glaciation, which had three phases, or stades. During the third, or Vashon Glaciation, a lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, called the Puget Lobe, spread south about 15,000 years ago, covering the Puget Sound region with an ice sheet about thick near Seattle, and nearly at the present Canada-US border. Since each new advance of ice scours away much of the evidence of previous ice ages, the most recent Vashon phase has left the clearest imprint on the land. At its maximum extent the Vashon ice sheet extended south of Olympia to near Tenino, and covered the lowlands between the Olympic and Cascade mountains. About 14,000 years ago the ice began to retreat. By 11,000 years ago it survived only north of the Canadian border.
The Vashon Glaciation scoured the land, creating a drumlin field of hundreds of aligned drumlin hills. Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish (which are ribbon lakes), Hood Canal, and the main Puget Sound basin were carved out by glacial forces. As the ice retreated, vast amounts of glacial till were deposited throughout the Puget Sound region. The soils of the region, less than ten thousand years old, are still characterized as immature.
As the Vashon glacier receded a series of proglacial lakes formed, filling the main trough of Puget Sound and inundating the southern lowlands. Glacial Lake Russell was the first such large recessional lake. From the vicinity of Seattle in the north the lake extended south to the Black Hills, where it drained south into the Chehalis River. Sediments from Lake Russell form the blue-gray clay identified as the Lawton Clay. The second major recessional lake was Glacial Lake Bretz. It also drained to the Chehalis River until the Chimacum Valley, in the northeast Olympic Peninsula, melted, allowing the lake's water to rapidly drain north into the marine waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which was rising as the ice sheet retreated.
As icebergs calved off the toe of the glacier, their embedded gravels and boulders were deposited in the chaotic mix of unsorted till geologists call "glaciomarine drift." Many beaches about the Sound display glacial erratics, rendered more prominent than those in coastal woodland solely by their exposed position; submerged glacial erratics sometimes cause hazards to navigation. The sheer weight of glacial-age ice depressed the landforms, which experienced post-glacial rebound after the ice sheets had retreated. Because the rate of rebound was not synchronous with the post-ice age rise in sea levels, the bed of what is Puget Sound, filled alternately with fresh and with sea water. The upper level of the lake-sediment Lawton Clay now lies about above sea level.
The Puget Sound system consists of four deep basins connected by shallower sills. The four basins are Hood Canal, west of the Kitsap Peninsula, Whidbey Basin, east of Whidbey Island, South Sound, south of the Tacoma Narrows, and the Main Basin, which is further subdivided into Admiralty Inlet and the Central Basin. Puget Sound's sills, a kind of submarine terminal moraine, separate the basins from one another, and Puget Sound from the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Three sills are particularly significant — the one at Admiralty Inlet which checks the flow of water between the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound, the one at the entrance to Hood Canal (about below the surface), and the one at the Tacoma Narrows (about ). Other sills that present less of a barrier include the ones at Blake Island, Agate Pass, Rich Passage, and Hammersley Inlet.
The depth of the basins is a result of the Sound being part of the Cascadia subduction zone, where the terranes accreted at the edge of the Juan de Fuca Plate are being subducted under the North American Plate: there has not been a major subduction zone earthquake here since the magnitude nine Cascadia Earthquake; according to Japanese records, it occurred 26 January 1700. Lesser Puget Sound earthquakes with shallow epicenters, caused by the fracturing of stressed oceanic rocks as they are subducted still cause great damage. The Seattle Fault cuts across Puget Sound, crossing just north of Vashon Island and dipping under the city of Seattle. To the south, the existence of a second fault, the Tacoma Fault has buckled the intervening strata in the Seattle Uplift.
Typical Puget Sound profiles of dense glacial till overlying permeable glacial outwash of gravels above an impermeable bed of silty clay may become unstable after periods of unusually wet weather and slump in landslides.
The Puget Sound region has been called "Ish River country", perhaps most famously by poet Robert Sund, owing to its numerous rivers with names ending in "ish", such as the Duwamish, Samish, Skokomish, Skykomish, Snohomish, and the Stillaguamish. The "ish" ending is from Salish language meaning "people of". 
Political geography.
The urban region designated the Puget Sound Region is centered on Seattle and consists of nine counties, two urban center cities and four satellite cities making up what has been dubbed "Pugetopolis". Both urban core cities have large industrial areas and seaports plus a high-rise central business district. The satellite cities are primarily suburban, featuring a small downtown core and a small industrial area or port. The suburbs consist mostly of residences, strip malls, and shopping centers. The region is also home to numerous ports. The two largest and busiest are the Port of Seattle and Port of Tacoma, which, if combined, comprise the third largest container port in North America after Los Angeles/Long Beach and New York/New Jersey.
The United States Census Bureau defines the Puget Sound region as the "Seattle–Tacoma–Olympia" Combined Statistical Area. This includes the Seattle metropolitan area, made up of the following counties ("see Fig. STB"):
Based on commuting patterns, the adjacent metropolitan areas of Olympia, Bremerton, and Mount Vernon, along with a few smaller satellite urban areas, are grouped together in the CSA. The population of this wider region is 4,269,349—almost two-thirds of Washington's population—. The Seattle CSA is the 12th largest CSA, and the 13th largest primary census statistical area in the country. The additional metropolitan and micropolitan areas included are:
A state-run ferry system, Washington State Ferries, connects the larger islands to the Washington mainland, as well as both sides of the sound, allowing cars and people to move about the greater Puget Sound region.
Flora and fauna.
North Pacific Oak Woodland is one of the principal plant associations of the Puget Trough, where many of the soils are well drained mesic.
It is estimated that more than 100 million geoducks (pronounced "gooey ducks") are packed into Puget Sound's sediments. Also known as "king clam", geoducks are considered to be a delicacy in Asian countries.

Claude Thomassin

Claude Auguste Thomassin (1865–1942) was a French bow maker, or "".
Son of Louis Thomassin with whom he learned his craft in Mirecourt. In his early career, he worked for the shop of Gand & Bernadel. Many bows from this period are stamped "Gand & Bernadel". In 1901 the family firm of Gand & Bernadel was taken over by Caressa & Français. It was at this point that Claude Thomassin set up his own atelier at Rue de Paris in Paris. Although he continued to produce some bows for his former employers, much of his output from 1901 onwards was branded with his name "Claude Thomassin" or sometimes "C.Thomassin à Paris".
Thomassin has been called one of the best makers of his generation.

Public agenda

Public Agenda is a nonprofit organization that helps diverse leaders and citizens navigate divisive and complex issues. Through nonpartisan research and engagement, it provides people with insights and support they need to arrive at workable solutions on critical issues, regardless of their differences. Since 1975, Public Agenda has helped foster progress on K-12 and higher education reform, health care, federal and local budgets, energy and immigration. 
The organization was founded by social scientist Daniel Yankelovich and former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.
According to Caroline L. Gilson of DePauw University, "The audience for Public Agenda Online is wide-ranging: from researchers and policy-makers to concerned citizens and activists. For an academic audience, this site serves as a starting point for students exploring a topic who want to understand how the public weighs in on key issues". One of Public Agenda's self-described goals is to bridge the divide that so often exists between American leaders and the American people.
In addition to education and leadership, subjects of interest include crime, poverty, the American economy and the federal budget.
The current president of Public Agenda is Will Friedman. Ruth A. Wooden, who joined Public Agenda in 2003, was president until 2010; Deborah Wadsworth had been the previous president. The organization is based in New York City.
Recent work.
In 2007, Public Agenda joined forces with a number of heavy-hitting political non-profits: The Brookings Institution, The Heritage Foundation, the Concord Coalition and Viewpoint Learning. The result of the relationship is Facing Up to the Nation's Finances, a web site that focuses on American budgetary issues. In 2008, Public Agenda released its first book entitled "Where Does the Money Go?" The book, authored by vice-presidents Scott Bittle and Jean Johnson, has turned out to be a campaign hit.
Controversy.
Bloggers have often criticized the organization for right or left-leaning research. At various times, Public Agenda has received this criticism on both ends of the spectrum, although the vast majority of citations refer to the organization as "non-partisan" in its work.

The International Accreditation Forum (IAF) Multilateral Recognition Arrangements (MLA) consists of an agreement between accreditation bodies for mutual recognition of accreditations. Among the signatories of this agreement are RABQSA International and the International Register of Certificated Auditors (IRCA), the two main management system personnel certification bodies.
The objective of the IAF MLA is to ensure that the personnel certifications granted by signatories of the IAF MLA can be recognized by other signatories, increasing the worldwide employability of the certified professionals.
Mutual recognition is based on peer evaluations between signatories to ensure each other's personnel certifications are equivalent and that each certified professional can perform the required tasks.
IAF MLA and ISO 17024.
There is currently a debate in the personnel certification world regarding the validity of peer evaluation. Some people criticize the concept of peer evaluation because it implies that the larger personnel certification bodies can impose their standards on others. These people would prefer to see the personnel certification bodies be certified to ISO 17024 with the national standard bodies. Thus, certification bodies would have a fixed set of standards (ISO 17024) to comply to and they'd be evaluated by independent bodies (the national standard bodies).

Green Hungarian

Green Hungarian, Butschera (Hungarian) or Putzscheere (German) is a white Hungarian wine grape. It is also found in California, but in recent years the grape has been declining in number of plantings. 
The grape variety is likely to have originated from the border area between Hungary and Rumania, or the Carpathians. In former times, it was much cultivated in much of central and eastern Europe as a high-yielding grape for simple wines, which has resulted that it is known under a large number of synonyms in different languages. It was also used as a table grape. Today, very little of it remains in cultivation in Europe.

The World Wreckers

The World Wreckers is a science fiction novel by Marion Zimmer Bradley in her Darkover series. It was first published by Ace Books in 1971. The book is notable for a complex sub-plot involving the sexual interactions between hermaphrodite native species known as the "chieri", and humans.
Though the book seems minor on a stand-alone basis, it is a pivotal event in the part of the series that Zimmer Bradley identified as "After the Comyn/Against the Terrans". Every book that follows chronologically, refers to The World Wreckers.
In "Author's Notes on Chronology", Bradley implies that "The World Wreckers" occurs about eighty years after the events in "The Winds of Darkover", basing this assertion on the age of Desideria Storn in the two books.
Plot Summary.
The mysterious Andrea Closson accepts a contract to wreck the economy of Darkover, so that the planet must turn to the Terran Empire for assistance. Closson’s thoughts reveal that she is a native of Darkover, a child of the Yellow Forest. 
Regis Hastur survives another assassination attempt. He and his paxman, Danilo Syrtis discuss the many mysterious deaths besieging the Comyn. Regis recalls that his two sons are among the deceased, and that many of the old Comyn families have died out altogether. He asks the Terrans to seek out telepaths on other worlds and send them to Darkover, for what becomes known as Project Telepath.
At Arillinn, Regis meets Linnea Storn, a matrix technician. He learns that her grandmother was Desideria Leynier-Storn, the leronis who raised Sharra to restore High Windward to its rightful family ("see The Winds of Darkover").
Citizens from all over Darkover apply to Regis for assistance, describing economic problems, crop failures, and fires. A member of the ancient Darkovan "chieri" race arrives and asks to speak to Regis. He volunteers to assist in Project Telepath.
The members of Project Telepath meet and evaluate each other. A number of tests are run. Missy proves to be a troublemaker. They discover that Keral is a hermaphrodite. Further tests prove that Missy, whom they originally believed to be human, is also a "chieri". As events unfold, it will become clear that "chieri" can be either sex, and can change gender at will. 
Two free Amazon guides arrive at Arillinn and ask to see the Keeper, Linnea Storn. They describe an recent client, Andrea Closson, whom they guided through the back country. They suspect that she has something to do with the ecological disaster that seems to have befallen Darkover. Linnea contacts Regis with this information.
Regis calls for all of the telepaths on Darkover to join him to combat the threat. During a festival dance, their minds join in ecstasy and call into the castle the form of Andrea Closson, whom one of the "chieri" identifies as a lost member of his people. Accepted back to her own people, Closson uses her own fortune to restore Darkover's ecology. She is able to find hope in her people's survival in Keral's child with Project Telepath member David Hamilton, a union such as resulted in the strain of the Comyn.
Regis creates a Telepathic Council dedicated to working in limited cooperation with the Terran Empire.

<doc id="19854606" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19854606" title="Chen Xianqi">
Chen Xianqi

Chen Xianqi (陳仙奇) (died 786) was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty. He had served under Li Xilie, who had rebelled against Emperor Dezong and claimed the title of emperor of his own state of Chu. Li Xilie, however, by 786, had become repeatedly defeated by Tang forces. When Li Xilie grew ill, Chen had him poisoned and then submitted to Tang, but was himself in turn assassinated by Wu Shaocheng later in the year.
Service under and killing of Li Xilie.
Virtually nothing is known about Chen Xianqi's background, including his birth date or his family origin. It is known that he had risen from soldier ranks to serve as an officer below Li Xilie while Li Xilie was the Tang military governor ("Jiedushi") of Huaixi Circuit. His wife carried the surname Dou, the same surname as Li Xilie's favorite concubine, a daughter of the official Dou Liang (竇良), whom Li Xilie had forced to become his concubine during the time he claimed imperial title at the emperor of his own state of Chu (a title he claimed in 784). Dou Liang's daughter, however, was secretly plotting against Li Xilie, and she persuaded Li Xilie that Chen was faithful and capable and thus should be trusted. Because she and Chen's wife shared the same surname, she informed Li Xilie that she would try to enter a friendship with Chen's wife in order to ensure his loyalty. After she befriended Chen's wife, she instead involved Chen and Chen's wife in the plot to destroy Li Xilie. When Li Xilie grew ill after eating beef in summer 786, at Chen's instigation, Li Xilie's physician poisoned him to death.
After Li Xilie's death, Li Xilie's son did not announce his death and was planning to kill officers who would not submit to him, and then declare himself Li Xilie's successor. Li Xilie's concubine Lady Dou, who had just received some peaches as tribute, wrote down the son's plans and hid the plan in a wax ball, and then hid the wax ball in a peach which she then gave to Chen's wife. Chen, realizing what Li Xilie's son was planning, entered the mansion along with fellow officer Xue Yu (薛育) and killed Li Xilie's son. He then killed Li Xilie's wife, brothers, and sons, and delivered the heads of Li Xilie, his wife, and his sons to the Tang capital Chang'an and submitted to Emperor Dezong. Emperor Dezong made him military governor of Huaixi.
As "Jiedushi".
As military governor, Chen tried to show loyalty to the imperial government immediately, and he sent troops to Tang's western borders that fall to help defend against attacks by Tufan. Just three months after he killed Li Xilie, however, one of LI Xilie's close associates, Wu Shaocheng, killed him and took over as acting military governor. Li Xilie's concubine also died in the coup. Emperor Dezong, while mourning Chen, did not dare to wage a campaign against Wu, and he made his own son Li Liang (李諒) the Prince of Qian the nominal military governor and Wu the deputy military governor, thus effectively allowing Wu to take over the circuit.

Guillermo López Langarica

Guillermo López Langarica (died September 25, 2008) was a Mexican YouTube celebrity who accidentally rose to fame in 2007. Prior to his death he was mostly known as 'El Canaca', (the Canaca guy). More recently he is remembered as 'Don Memo'. Born in 1968 in El Salto, Jalisco.
Rise to fame.
López Langarica came to the public spotlight when he was detained in Guadalajara, Jalisco, for speed-driving under the influence of alcohol in 2002. He was interviewed and featured in a TV show titled 'El Show de la Barandilla', which mostly aired comical police interventions against drunkards. A few years later, his video was uploaded to YouTube and quickly gained nation-wide fame.
In the video, López Langarica explains to the reporter how he was wrongly detained, as he was drunk-driving but had not 'crashed yet'. He also claimed the police officers robbed him of $ 50,000.00 Mexican pesos he carried along, explaining he had a pack of a hundred $ 500.00 pesos bills. ("Y mis cincuenta mil pesos ¿qué?") When asked about his income's origins he claimed to work at Promotora Mexicana Gaitán, a commerce located at 6-6-30-6-71-3-3-3-3 (he forgot to mention a 3 before the phone number). He identified himself as the owner's son, a man named Miguel Ángel Gaytán Uribe, who also allegedly served as President of an organization called 'CANACA', acronym which, he said, stands for 'Centrales de Abastos de la República Mexicana'. Finally, he asks the cameraman to tape his right ankle, angrily accusing the officers of restraining him like a pig. ("¡Me amarraron como puerco!")
The YouTube video was an instant phenomenon, having received over six million views to date. López Langarica rose to national fame because of his comical explanation of events, places, and his catch-phrases '¿Y qué? No he chocado' (So what? I haven't crashed yet), 'Apúntele bien' (Literally meaning: "Write this down", but he meant: "aim correctly"), 'Soy hijo del papá' (I'm son of the father) referring to his relation with "the owner", '¡Me amarraron como puerco!' (They tied me like a pig!!), and his definition of the acronym CANACA.
In Mexico there is no organization by the name 'CANACA'. Some of the closest examples would be the Cámara Nacional de Comercio (CANACO), the Confederación Nacional de Agrupaciones de Comerciantes de Centros de Abastos (CONACCA) and the Cámara Nacional de Autotransportes de Carga (CANACAR) [http://www.canacar.com.mx/qospage/wb/CANACAR/CANA_ini.
Promotora Mexicana Gaitán (PROMEGA) "does" exist, it is an enterprise which imports/exports fruits and vegetables, specially strawberries, with offices both in Guadalajara and Mexico City. The former is located at 6th Street's 630. The phone number is +52(33)3671-3333. Whether López Langarica worked there or not is unknown. No one by the name Miguel Ángel Gaytán works at PROMEGA, but there is a Miguel Ángel Gaytán Uribe who served as the vigilancy committee's president at the Unión de Comerciantes del Mercado de Abastos de Guadalajara (UCMA).
Death.
On the night of September 25, 2008, López Langarica was run over in Guadalajara by a Dodge Neon, driven by a heavily intoxicated woman named Silvia Teresa Borboa. He was totally sober. When the police arrived, the woman claimed someone had put the body under her car. The fact immediately made it to national news and was featured in Mexico's most prominent news reports and newspapers.
Legacy.
Numerous parodies and tributes spawned after the original video's popularity, such as imitations, animated versions, musical remixes, and even religious prayers. Also, other Mexican drunken celebrities gained fame, such as Dios Eolo (God Aeolus), the 'Ni Merga' guy, the Sicarios de Montemorelos (Montemorelos killers), the 'Tengo Miedo'(I'm Afraid) guy, and the 'Me Estoy yendo por la Banqueta', (I'm on the Sidewalk) -he was really on the street- amongst others . After López Langarica's death numerous tribute and farewell videos appeared in YouTube. T-shirts imprinted with his famous phrases or the Mexican soccer team Atlas's logo are for sale in some street markets. Also, YouTube users posted several comments in his famous video, while some users encourage fans to call and dennounce Silvia Teresa Borboa, even providing alleged personal data, such as her home address, and her cell phone number.
More recently, some people in Guadalajara claim to have witnessed apparitions by López Langarica's ghost, leading users on the net to jokingly refer to him as 'San Canaca'.

Tony Sage

Antony William Paul Sage, better known as Tony Sage (born 26 June 1960), is a Western Australian businessman. A qualified accountant and fund manager, he finances and manages mining and exploration companies in Australia and overseas. He also owns Perth's A-League soccer team, Perth Glory, and has other business interests in publishing, tourism, fashion and entertainment.
Biography.
Born in Gloucester, England, on 26 June 1960, Sage, as a child, regularly travelled between England and his mother's home town of Salerno in Italy. His family moved to Australia in 1967 and resided first in Adelaide, then Melbourne and Sydney before transferring to New Zealand in 1975. In 1978 he returned to Australia, enrolling at Churchlands College (now part of Edith Cowan University) in Perth where he graduated with a Bachelor of Business (Accounting and Finance) in 1980. He later became a Fellow of the Society of Certified Practising Accountants, a Chartered Accountant, and a Fellow of the Taxation Institute of Australia. He has three children Jessica, Emily and Matthew.
Sage acted as a funds manager for the property trust group Growth Equities Mutual Limited based in Western Australia. From the late-1990s, he financed and managed a range of listed mining and exploration companies including Cape Lambert Resources, African Petroleum, Cauldron Energy, Gabriel Resources, International Petroleum, International Goldfields, Fe Limited, Kupang Resources, Glory Resources and successfully floated African Iron which he subsequently sold to Exarro for approximately $400m. 
In 2008, Sage sold the Cape Lambert iron ore project in the Pilbara region of Western Australia for A$400 million to Chinese firm, China Metallurgical Group Corporation. The project had been purchased two years earlier for approximately A$20 million and during the 24 months that followed, Cape Lambert Iron Ore Ltd spent approximately A$50 million on exploration activities.
He was a founder of radio network Red FM, which was later sold to WA Newspapers Limited for a considerable profit, and is also a former owner of the West Perth nightclub, Onyx Bar, which opened in 2005. In June 2008, Sage purchased a 49 per cent stake in the Perth Fashion Festival. Sage is also the publisher of the very successful KURV magazine.
Sage became sole owner of the Perth Glory soccer team after completing a buy-out of partner Mr Brett McKeon in February 2008.
In 2012 he and Benny Elias were reported to be investigating the formation of a Perth team in the National Rugby League competition, in a similar setup to that of Newcastle mining entrepreneur Nathan Tinkler. However, NRL authorities later ruled out inclusion of any new teams until at least 2017.
As owner of Perth Glory, Sage is known for having a 'calming influence' over his team in times of crisis. Players and coaches alike have reported that Sage's mere presence in the change rooms after a disappointing result is enough to prevent any ill feeling between coaches and players, and prevents his club from becoming a 'laughing stock'. After the A League Grand Final loss to Brisbane Roar in 2011/2012, Captain Jacob Burns reported that he "was ready to punch on" with both the club's goalkeeping coach and kit manager, but felt "an instant serenity" when he saw Sage asking coach Ian Ferguson for his autograph.

Raymond W. McDaniel Jr.

Raymond W. McDaniel Jr. is an American business executive who is president and chief executive officer of Moody's Corporation, the parent company of Moody's Investors Service and Moody's Analytics.
Education.
McDaniel earned a B.A. in political science from Colgate University, and a J.D. from Emory University School of Law. In 1984 McDaniel was admitted to the New York State Bar.
Career.
Moody's Corporation.
McDaniel joined Moody's Investors Service in New York in 1987 as an analyst in Asset Securitization. In 2001 he became president of Moody's Investors Service, and was elected to the Moody's Corporation board of directors in 2003. McDaniel became chief operating officer of Moody's Corporation in January 2004. From October 2004 until April 2005 McDaniel served as president of Moody's Corporation. In April 2005, McDaniel was named chairman and CEO of Moody's Corporation He served as the chairman of the board of directors from 2005 to 2012, when Henry McKinnell was named Chairman of the Board of Directors. In 2012, as part of the decision to split the role of chairman and CEO, he again became president of Moody's Corporation, where he currently oversees the company's two divisions; Moody's Investors Service and Moody's Analytics. 
Other positions held by McDaniel during the course of his Moody's career include managing director and executive vice president within the Global Ratings and Research division of Moody's Investors Service. He also held the roles of managing director for Moody's Europe in London and managing director for international operations, which designs and manages regional expansion in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. According to Moody's Corporation, under McDaniel's leadership, the company has expanded its reach into new worldwide markets and broadened the range of new products, experiencing the best financial performance in the company's history 
Between 2007 and 2009, Moody's and other credit rating agencies were the subject of criticism for their ratings of subprime mortgage backed securities. McDaniel testified regarding the ratings at U.S. congressional hearings on multiple occasions, where he stated he was "deeply disappointed with the performance of ratings associated with the housing sector."
In 2010, McDaniel was the subject of some media scrutiny due to sales of company stock prior to a drop in Moody's share value, and coincident with the company's receipt of a Wells notice from the SEC. Although some observers expressed skepticism about McDaniel's actions amid the timing of the stock sales, Moody's stated that McDaniel's sales had been part of a pre-arranged plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1.
Moody’s and other credit rating agencies were again the subject of scrutiny with respect to the European Sovereign crisis. In March 2012, McDaniel published an article on Moody’s website called "A Solution for the Credit Rating Agency Debate" in which he urged public institutions frustrated with private-sector credit ratings to start a public credit-ratings firm that could provide "competing views".
At the Milken Institute Global Conference in May 2011, McDaniel cautioned against using ratings in a "mechanistic" way, where changes in rating automatically produce market effects. He had previously advised that investors should use ratings as a tool rather than a specific market strategy, in testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010. He has endorsed rules and regulations that increase market transparency and quality of ratings, as long as they do not interfere with the independence of ratings content produced by private agencies.
Other positions held.
McDaniel joined the board of directors of the Council for Economic Education (then the National Council on Economic Education) in 2003, and has helped expand its workshops in New York City public schools. In September 2005, he joined the board of directors of the global publishing company John Wiley & Sons. McDaniel has appeared as a speaker at the Milken Institute Global Conference in 2011 and 2012.

Potrero Generating Station

On Dec. 21, 2010, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom announced that the Potrero plant would cease operations by the end of the year. In a press conference announcing the closure, Newsom stated that "this is a monumental step towards cleaner air, environmental justice and our future of renewable energy and healthier communities." The plant was shut down in January 2011, and the property is being considered for redevelopment.
History and capacity.
The Potrero power station was located at a site in Potrero Point originally used by San Francisco Gas Light, a provider of gas for cooking and lighting in the late 19th century. Circa 1890 they constructed a small electrical generator at the site, which was the first power plant for the company that would later become Pacific Gas and Electric. Unit 3 was constructed in 1965, making it one of the oldest power plants still operated in California until its closure. The peaking units 4, 5, and 6 were constructed in 1976.
Unit 3, the primary power generator, consisted of an eight story natural gas powered boiler that produced superheated high pressure steam. San Francisco Bay water was purified and heated to produce high pressure steam. This steam was run through a turbine that subsequently turned a 206 MW generator made by Westinghouse. The steam that exited the turbine was then cooled to allow it to condense back into water. The cooling water used in this process operated on a once-through exchange with San Francisco Bay. At full power approximately 10 m3/s (226 million gallons per day) of water were pumped from the subsurface of the Bay, passed through screens and filters to remove debris and prevent biological uptake. The cooling water then passed through the condenser to cool steam used to power the steam turbine. The water was returned to the Bay at about 10 C warmer, usually no warmer than 30 C (86 F).
In addition to the main unit, three 52 MW diesel powered peaking generators could be brought online in four minutes and to peak load in ten minutes notice to meet extra electricity demands as specified by the California Independent System Operator. They were generally operated for only a few hours at a time, usually during peak power consumption in the afternoon. In total, they were generally utilized less than 200 hours per year, though they could be online longer if Unit 3 was offline for an extended period (for example due to maintenance). Fuel for these generators was stored on site and was delivered by tanker truck, though in the past it was delivered directly by ship. There were three large fuel storage tanks at the Potrero facility.
Closure.
For many years an effort had been made by Mirant to expand or upgrade the Potrero Point facility, while many in the local community felt the site should be closed due to health and pollution concerns. In particular, there was concern that the flow of water through the plant was damaging the local environment in the Bay, though Mirant disputed this. On March 2, 2006, the California Public Utilities Commission announced its rejection of Mirant's expansion plans. At that time, the plant was tentatively scheduled to be shut down sometime in 2007 so that a more modern replacement of similar size could be built at the site, but subsequently plans were scaled back and called only for the diesel peaking power generators to be upgraded. The proposed upgrade, estimated to cost between $80 million and $100 million, would have converted the peaking generators to run on natural gas. This would have decreased, but not eliminated, pollution and removed the need to store large quantities of diesel fuel on site. 
In 2009 the City of San Francisco and Mirant agreed to close down the plant, pending approval from the California Independent System Operator. CASIO ruled a month later that the plant must stay on line at least through 2010, and only after upgrades to the electrical transmission grid going into San Francisco were completed and the city was able to import sufficient power from other parts of the state to meet all of its needs. Meanwhile, the plant continued to generate thermal pollution by the discharge of heated water to San Francisco Bay, and Mirant had given no indication that it would take any steps to further control those discharges.
On December 21, 2010, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom announced that the Potrero plant would cease operations by the end of the year. Potrero Generating Station was permanently shut down in January 2011. GenOn Energy, Mirant's parent corporation, will solicit bids to sell the property for redevelopment. Developers expect the area to be used for high-density housing or office space after the site undergoes an environmental cleanup.

List of Hamtaro episodes

This is a list of episodes from the anime series Hamtaro, based on the children's book series by Ritsuko Kawai. The anime series is directed by Osamu Nabeshima and produced by Shogakukan. The series involves the adventure of a brave and childlike hamster named Hamtaro, with his Ham-Ham friends. It began airing in Japan on July 7, 2000. "Hamtaro" has been aired throughout the world on many stations.
As of April 5, 2006, a series known as "Norisuta Hai" began airing five-minute "Hamtaro" episodes known as """" The "Norisuta Hai" series is animated differently from the original series; most notably the head-to-body ratio is off, and is designed to appeal to a younger audience. There does not seem to be any connection between "Tottoko Hamutaro" and "Tottoko Hamutaro: Norisuta Hai!" beyond the planned appearance of all fifteen original Ham-Hams (Excluding Lapis and Lazuli).
"Hamtaro" 1.1 – 1.12 were released in Australia, with three episodes on each DVD. But there are no plans for further releases for the other episodes. "Hamtaro" Volume 1 – Volume 3, with four episodes on each DVD were released in Germany by RTL2.

Afghans in Germany

In 2009, the German government estatimated the number of people of Afghan descent residing in Germany at 126,334. Of those, 49,081 were only holding an Afghan passport, while 77,253 were holding a German passport.
This makes Germany's Afghan community one of the largest in Europe. In particular, there are about 22,000 Afghans in Hamburg.
The Afghan community in Germany is heterogeneous with various political views, as they are in Afghanistan (see Demography of Afghanistan). Though with the NATO involvement in Afghanistan, the community has come closer together due to shared hopes and worries. However, the community is not well organized and has no representative associations or organizations.

Center of origin

The center of origin (or centre of origin) is a geographical area where a group of organisms, either domesticated or wild, first developed its distinctive properties. Centers of origin are also considered centers of diversity.
Plants.
Locating the origin of crop plants is basic to plant breeding. This allows one to locate wild relatives, related species, and new genes (especially dominant genes, which may provide resistance to diseases).
Knowledge of the origins of crop plants is important in order to avoid genetic erosion, the loss of germplasm due to the loss of ecotypes and landraces, loss of habitat (such as rainforests), and increased urbanization. Germplasm preservation is accomplished through gene banks (largely seed collections but now frozen stem sections) and preservation of natural habitats (especially in centers of origin).
Vavilov centers.
A Vavilov Center (aka Vavilov Center of Diversity) is a region of the world first indicated by Dr. Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov to be an original center for the domestication of plants. Vavilov developed a theory on the centers of origin of cultivated plants. He stated that plants were not domesticated somewhere in the world at random but there are regions where the domestication started. 
The center of origin is also considered the center of diversity. Until today Vavilov centers are regions where a high diversity of crop wild relatives can be found, representing the natural relatives of domesticated crop plants.

Andrea Merenda

Andrea Merenda (born 10 June 1977 in Milan) is an Italian football midfielder who currently plays for Marconi Stallions in the NSW Premier League.
Biography.
Merenda had been in training with the Mariners for a month before earning his shot at the Hyundai A-League, having most recently completed the 2007/08 Italian Serie C1 campaign with Calcio Lecco, an historic club from the north of Italy once coached by Roberto Donadoni. 
Born in Milan, Merenda came to Australia seeking a fresh challenge after 16 seasons in his home country that included stints at nine clubs across various divisions – peaking with six seasons in the third-tier Serie C1, a division that once pitted Merenda against current Qantas Socceroo Carl Valeri. 
Equally at home in defence or midfield, Merenda was introduced to the yellow and navy set up as short-term cover for injured attacking ace Ahmad Elrich. Merenda’s signing, albeit on a short-term basis, was a significant one for the Mariners, who until his capture had yet to engage the services of a foreign player from abroad. He was released after failing to break into the first team.

David Measham

David Michael Lucian Measham (1 December 19376 February 2005) was a British-Australian conductor and violinist.
Measham was born in Nottingham, England, to a musical family. His father, Lester, had trained as an opera singer and his mother, Joan, was a pianist. He began violin studies at age 7, and first conducted at age 13. He attended the Mundella Grammar School (Nottingham), and later the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London, where he studied with Norman Del Mar. He then became a section violinist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He served with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra as co-leader (1963–1967) alongside John Georgiadis. He became principal second violin with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in 1967 following Neville Marriner's departure.
At one rehearsal, Measham took over when the conductor, Leonard Bernstein, said he wanted to hear what the orchestra sounded like from the back of the hall and called for a volunteer conductor. He then had further assistance in conducting from Bernstein. Subsequently, in his conducting career, Measham was music director of Phoenix Opera, and chief conductor of the Stetson University Summer Institute in Florida. In 1971, Measham made his Royal Festival Hall conducting debut with the LSO, when he took over from Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt at the last minute on one 2-hour rehearsal.
Measham worked as a conductor with non-classical artists such as the saxophonist Ornette Coleman ("The Skies Of America", 1972), Pete Townshend ("Tommy", 1972), Neil Young ("Harvest", 1972) and on a full orchestral version of the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". In 1974, Measham conducted the LSO on Rick Wakeman's "Journey to the Centre of the Earth", touring America and Japan and later the New World Symphony Orchestra on "The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table".
In 1971, Measham emigrated to Western Australia and was based in Perth. He was principal conductor of the West Australian Symphony Orchestra 1974-81, and its principal guest conductor 1981-86. There he gave many first performances, and took the orchestra on its first overseas tour, to Singapore, and to the Sydney Festival, before an audience of 120,000. In 1975, he began an indoor season of three Promenade Concerts as part of the Perth International Arts Festival, modelled on The Proms. He presented a radio series for ABC Classic FM called "Both Sides Of The Podium", where orchestra players discussed their experiences working with various conductors. His other interests in Perth included yachting, and he was a member of the Claremont Yacht Club.
Measham's recordings include several with flautist Sir James Galway. He also recorded works by Barber, Kabalevsky, Shostakovich, Vaughan Williams, John Ireland, Peggy Glanville-Hicks and John Carmichael, and the only commercial recording of Wilfred Josephs' Kaddish based Requiem.
Measham died of cancer of the pancreas, in Perth. His early marriage to the soprano Susan Shoemaker ended in divorce. His two children from his marriage, Aaron and Guenevere, survive him.

Battle of Los Angeles (professional wrestling)

The Battle of Los Angeles tournament (the BOLA) is an annual independent wrestling tournament in North America, run and promoted by Pro Wrestling Guerrilla. Over the years, the tournament has attracted numerous famous independent wrestlers from A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels to Bryan Danielson.
The tournament setup.
In the first year of the Battle of Los Angeles there were sixteen participants, with eight opening round matches, four quarterfinal matches, two semifinal matches, and a final. In 2006 the tournament was expanded to 24 participants, which caused the addition of another eight person bracket and created three semifinals matches and an elimination three-way final match. In 2008 the tournament returned to its 16 man format. In 2011, the tournament was completely revamped, taking place for the first time as a one night tournament with only eight participants.
Results.
2005.
The first annual Battle of Los Angeles was held on September 3 and 4, 2005, in Los Angeles, California.
2006.
The 2006 BOLA was held on September 1, September 2 and September 3, 2006 in Reseda, California. The tournament saw the PWG returns of The Briscoe Brothers, after no-showing a number of events, and Super Dragon, who had been injured by the Dynasty earlier in the year.
Alex Koslov was originally scheduled to take part in the tournament, but was replaced by Austin Aries, after going on a six month learning excursion to Mexico. After no-showing "Threemendous" a month earlier, Jay and Mark Briscoe were taken out of the tournament and replaced by Bryan Danielson and Dragon Kid, respectively. However, Danielson separated his shoulder on August 26 in a Ring of Honor match against Colt Cabana and was therefore taken out of the tournament and replaced by Disco Machine.
The 2006 BOLA saw the introduction of wrestlers from Dragon Gate, which was represented by three regulars (CIMA, Genki Horiguchi and Dragon Kid), and finished the tournament with a combined 5-3 record.
Finals: Davey Richards defeated CIMA‡ via pinfall in 13:42 to win the 2006 BOLA
2007.
The 2007 BOLA was held on August 31, September 1 and September 2, 2007 in Burbank, California. The event suffered many losses leading up to it including PWG World Champion Bryan Danielson suffering an eye injury, former World Champion Super Dragon pulling himself from the event and former BOLA winner Chris Bosh announcing his retirement out of nowhere. They were replaced by TNA wrestler Alex Shelley, local worker Tony Kozina and the Necro Butcher. At "Giant-Size Annual #4" the month before the event Austin Aries defeated Rocky Romero to take his spot in BOLA.
Finals: CIMA defeated Roderick Strong and El Generico via pinfall in 13:17 in an elimination three-way match to win the 2007 BOLA
2008.
The fourth annual BOLA was held on November 1 and November 2, 2008 in Burbank, California. The tournament was set to follow the 24 man format of the previous two and take place on the weekend of August 30 and 31, but PWG management was unable to book the talent they wished to for the event and decided to move the event and drop the entrants down to 16. On October 16 PWG announced that 17 participants will be in the tournament, this occurred because the two PWG commissioners (Excalibur and Dino Winwood) couldn't come to a conclusion on who would be the final entrant, which lead to one first round match being a three way dance.
2009.
The fifth annual BOLA was held on November 20 and November 21, 2009, in Reseda, California. Due to Bryan Danielson winning the PWG World Championship in his farewell match and afterwards vacating it, this year's would also become the new World Champion. The first round of the tournament consisted of eight one-on-one matches between 16 wrestlers. Local newcomers Brandon Gatson and Jerome Robinson earned their spots in the tournament by winning separate four-way matches at PWG's "Against the Grain" on October 2. Chris Sabin was scheduled to take part in the tournament, but was forced to pull out due to a neck injury. He was replaced by another local newcomer Johnny Goodtime.
2010.
The sixth annual BOLA was held on September 4 and 5, 2010, in Reseda, California. The tournament included 18 participants, up from previous two years.
2011.
The seventh annual BOLA took place on August 20, 2011, in Reseda, California. For the first time, the entire tournament was held over one night with only eight participants.
2012.
The eighth annual BOLA took place on September 1 and 2, 2012, in Reseda, California. Initially, on July 22, the tournament was announced as taking place in one night with twelve participants, however, the following day it was expanded to two nights with four more wrestlers added, when another event scheduled for the Reseda venue was cancelled.
2013.
The ninth annual BOLA took place on August 30 and 31, in Reseda, California. Davey Richards was originally announced for the tournament, but later pulled out.

Lahnstein family

The Lahnstein family is a very wealthy and aristocratic prestigious fictional family on the German soap opera "Verbotene Liebe (Forbidden Love)". The Lahnsteins have been a staple on "Verbotene Liebe" since their introduction in September 2003.
The Lahnsteins are a family of tradition and appear with high morals to which they don't see to hold up to. They are known for their conversations on the dinner table. It became a choice by the producers over the years that the "evil characters" would sit on the right side of the table, while the "good characters" sit on the left side with the patriarch of the family on the head.
Over the years, the Lahnsteins also became known for their celebrations and events. Several weddings took place at their residence, Königsbrunn Castle. There were also festivities like a masquerade ball or an oldtimer race. All events are known for going not as planned. A hostage crisis, shocking paternity reveal, attempted murder or the reveal of affairs took place at those events. But they are also known for the beginning of great love stories.
It has become known that members of the Lahnstein family have had affairs with their servants. These affairs may have ended in producing illegitimate children or even marriage. This fact also caused the family to gain a reputation of hypocrisy and caused them to be known as a dysfunctional clan.
Family history.
Background.
The Lahnstein family, according to story in 2012, is first mentioned in 1512 and is one of the prestigious names along the German aristocracy. Their back story starts in the 1960s, when Johannes von Lahnstein is about to marry Francesca di Balbi, after having an affair with her younger sister Maria. She ends up pregnant with Johannes' child, but eventually has to give up her baby boy as she is committed to an insane asylum after tried to shoot Johannes. Her sister Francesca takes the boy, names him Ansgar and raises him as her own. Francesca and Ansgar have a special bond and she always looks out for him, while Johannes starts to resent the boy somehow at a young age. While Johannes and Francesca end up with the first child of their own, a daughter named Carla, Johannes' older brother Ludwig falls in love a maid named Madeline. Dietrich von Lahnstein, Johannes and Ludwig's father, wants Ludwig to end things with Madeline as she is below its level. Ludwig doesn't want to leave Madeline and gets disowned by his father. Ludwig and Madeline end up living aboard, raising their five children.
In the meanwhile, Johannes and Francesca's marriage is troubled. While Francesca finds comfort in the arms of Johannes' best friend, Adrian Degenhardt, Johannes has a one-night-stand with young maid Elke Käppler. Francesca ends up pregnant with Adrian's child, which gives her marriage to Johannes new strength as Johannes doesn't know about the affair. Elke ends up pregnant as well. After she hides her pregnancy, she gives up her daughter for adoption. Francesca and Johannes welcome a boy named Leonard. As Francesca and Johannes get estranged from each other, Johannes has an affair with the married Vera Brandner. The affair is short-lived, but his marriage with Francesca stays unhappy. Francesca soon finds comfort in the arms of Adrian again and wants to break free from Johannes. But ending up pregnant once again, Francesca is unsure if a future with Adrian is what she really wants. Johannes finds out about Francesca's affair and wants her to stay, even telling her that he will take on Adrian's bastard, a boy named Constantin, on as his own. Francesca agrees as she knows that Johannes can provide better for her than Adrian.
Ludwig and Madeline live a happy marriage in the aboard but are thorn apart as Madeline kills some South American business man in self-defense. Madeline faces prison time as there is no proof to her shooting in self-defense. Ludwig takes the blame and gets separated from his family. As he faces a life time in prison, he and Madeline decide that it's better if their children think their father has died. Madeline never overcame her guilt and died later on. Adrian became provider and father figure for Ludwig's children. His oldest son Hagen, not wanting to deal with his parents death, takes off and the second oldest Sebastian starts to take care of his three younger siblings.
Francesca, while accepting her marriage to Johannes, is never ever really happy again in spite of Johannes trying to make things work. Their children grow up with a distorted picture of Johannes and Francesca, believing that they are happy and that Johannes carries his wifs on his hands. Ansgar is the only one who seems to notice Francesca's sadness. She later dies in her children's youth in a car accident with Leonard behind the weel, who would blame himself for the death of his mother for the rest of his life. After Francesca's death, Johannes sends Constantin to Francesca's sister Carlotta as he resembles his the mother the most and can't bare to look at him. Constantin starts to blame himself for his father's resentment, while Ansgar becomes vicious towards Johannes and is power hungry for his inheritance.
2003-2009.
Johannes' love for oldtimer stars a friendship with Cécile de Maron. She just had a troubled relationship and isn't interested in anything more than a friendship with Johannes. But he soon falls for the dark haired French. Johannes tries to win Cécile over, which is soon crowned with success. In the meanwhile, Vera Brandner's husband Achim finds out that he's not the biological father of his daughter Nico. She starts to look from where she came and finds old letters, written by Johannes. Nico soon is revealed to be Johannes' illegitimate daughter. After some differences, Nico and Johannes have a healthy father-daughter relationship.
Against the will of Carla and Ansgar, Johannes soon decides to marry Cécile just when Leonard comes back to town. Leonard and Cécile soon find themselves drawn to each other and start having an affair. In the meanwhile, Carla is a closet lesbian and can't bring herself to come out to Johannes. Instead she starts a relationship with Bernd von Beyenbach. As he finds out about Carla's secret, Bernd makes sure that Carla thinks of him as a friend she can trust and soon opts to marry Carla. She thinks it might be the best idea and agrees. Even though Johannes finds out about Carla before the wedding takes place, he wants his daughter to go along with the ceremony. With tears in her eyes, Carla exchanges the 'I do's' with Bernd. 
As Constantin comes back to Königsbrunn, it does not take long for him to clash with Johannes over shipping him off to Italy to live with Carlotta. Johannes tries to assure Constantin that he loves him and even feels sorry for his doings, when Constantin finds out about not being Johannes' son. That causes them to drive apart even further. However Johannes eventually makes right by Constantin and even though they continue to have their differences, the two share a loving relationship with each other. 
Johannes' marriage with Cécile falls apart after she can't hide her feelings for Leonard anymore. When Johannes finds out about Cécile and Leonard, he disowns his son and divorces Cécile. She tries to reconnect Johannes and Leonard, but Johannes thinks she made a fool out of him while he's hurt by Leonard's actions. Only after Cécile is killed in a car accident and Leonard not only loses the love of his life but also their unborn baby, he and Johannes reunite at Cécile's grave.
Critical response.
Over the years, the Lahnstein family has become the "soapiest soap family", thanks to unexpected twists such as Johannes' never ending affairs from the past and juicy schemes in their own family, like poising, attempted murder and blackmail. Overall the Lahnstein family has remained very popular with fans, thanks to viewer's favourites Claudia Hiersche (Carla), Wolfram Grandezka (Ansgar) and Verena Zimmermann (Nico) and the involvement with other popular actors like Miriam Lahnstein (Tanja) and Yvonne Burbach (Cécile). In 2009, even though the character Maria di Balbi was a success, fans felt that former patriarch Johannes, who supposedly died in 2008 in a plane crash, was made out to be a hypocrite and liar, who seemed to treat Maria like dirt. It didn't seem to fit in with the character the audience had watched for years. With the change in the family and the focus pushed onto Ludwig's children, the audience didn't respond well by saying that Helena, Rebecca, Sebastian and Tristan just weren't characters you cared about. Only new family patriarch Ludwig, who became center of a love triangle with Johannes' former wive Elisabeth and Maria seemed to be interesting.
Residence.
The family residence is Castle Königsbrunn
The city residence is a Penthouse
Business.
The Lahnstein Holding.
Once appeared as the Lahnstein empire, founded for over hundred years. Johannes von Lahnstein was the CEO for a very long time, later omit by his eldest son Ansgar, which led to Johannes founding a company named "JCL Investment". After Johannes could reclaim his title as CEO of the Lahnstein Holding, he merged "JCL" into the Holding. After Johannes died, Ansgar faked his father's will. In that he made the family believe that Ansgar's son Hannes is the heir and Ansgar can have control over the business until Hannes is at a legal age to take charge of his inheritance. The family later realizes that Ansgar faked the will, and Carla took over as the rightful heir. Ansgar tried to scheme his way back to the head of the company, but failed several times in his attempts to discredit Carla as a businesswoman. 
After Carla leaves town, she leaves control over the company to her stepmother Elisabeth and her uncle Ludwig. The company soon gets in serious money trouble and Ludwig has to buy off some parts of the company. Ansgar's devilish wife Tanja von Anstetten manages to get her hand on the real estate department, while Ludwig decides to form a new company named "Lahnstein Enterprises".
Lahnstein Enterprises.
"Lahnstein Enterprises" is a new company founded by Ludwig von Lahnstein with the help and money of his nephew Ansgar in 2010. Part of the company also becomes the real estate department that Tanja von Anstetten bought off from the "Lahnstein Holding". In June 2011, a board is formed that's headed by Ludwig. The "Lahnstein Bank" rejoins the company when Ansgar signs on and the "Lahnstein Entertainment" department is formed. In order to bring Tanja to sign on, Ludwig buys her the fashion company "Ligne Clarisse", a company formerly owned by Tanja's archenemy Clarissa von Anstetten, out of the heritage of late Marie von Anstetten. When Clarissa turns up alive, she gets half of her former company, only to be blackmailed by Tanja to leave her shares to her.
v. L. Faces.
Is a model agency founded and owned by Tanja von Lahnstein. Former known as v. A. Faces (changed the name after Tanja married Ansgar). The company is written out without any explanation in late 2009.
Ligne Clarisse Lahnstein.
"Ligne Clarisse" is a fashion company founded by Clarissa von Anstetten and appears for the first time in the show's premiere. As a business rival to "Cara Donna", another fashion house owned by Clarissa's rival Barbara von Sterneck, the company was used in many storylines within the first five years of the show. For a short time, Clarissa's arch enemy Tanja von Anstetten could get her hands on the company before Clarissa got it back. When Clarissa was presumed dead in 2001 the company went to Marie von Anstetten, Clarissa's goddaughter, as part of her will. Marie suddenly dies ten years later and Tanja buys the moribund company, who now becomes part of "Lahnstein Enterprises" to one last laugh over Clarissa. But it is eventually explain that Clarissa isn't dead. Instead she spent the last ten years in prison and has now to find out that Tanja is owning her lifelong work. Even though she promises her children to stay away from Tanja, Clarissa secretly plans to get her company back. Later in 2011, the company is renamed to "Ligne Clarisse Lahnstein" (sometimes named "Ligne CL" or "LCL") and plans a comeback with the legendary Incest campaign, who presents the company's golden year of 1997. As of February 2012, Tanja owns now half of the company.

Shimmer Tag Team Championship

The Shimmer Tag Team Championship (stylized as SHIMMER Tag Team Championship) is a professional wrestling tag team championship in Shimmer Women Athletes. The title is recognized nationally by Ring of Honor, and also by several independent promotions, including American Luchacore, Insanity Pro Wrestling and Shine Wrestling, where it has also been defended.
History.
Since the creation of the Shimmer Championship, there was a growing interest in creating a Shimmer Tag Team Championship. This was stemmed from a growing number of teams such as The Experience and the Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew, and frequent tag team matches on the cards of Shimmer events. In October 2008, the first champions were crowned when the duo of Ashley Lane and Nevaeh won a Gauntlet Match involving six teams at "Shimmer Volume 21".
Lane and Nevaeh as well as being the first Shimmer Tag Team Champions also hold the distinction of being the first Shimmer champions to defend their title outside of Shimmer or either of its sister companies (Full Impact Pro and Ring of Honor). On November 1, Lane and Nevaeh defended their title at an Insanity Pro Wrestling show against "Sassy" Stephie Sinclair and Hellena Heavenly. On November 22 they made their third defense of the belts at an Heartland Wrestling Association event, defeating the team of Mary Elizabeth and Hailey Hatred.
After successfully defending the title in Shimmer against the Canadian NINJAs (Nicole Matthews and Portia Perez), The International Home Wrecking Crew (Jetta and Rain) and Amazing Kong and Sara Del Rey, Lane and Nevaeh lost the title to the Canadian NINJAs in a rematch on May 3, 2009, at the tapings of "Shimmer Volume 26".
Nicole Matthews and Portia Perez made their first Shimmer Tag Team Title defense on October 18, 2009, at an Anarchy Championship Wrestling event titled "A Nightmare on Tenth Street", where they defeated Rachel Summerlyn and Jessica James via disqualification.
On April 10, 2010, at the tapings of Volume 29, Matthews and Perez made their first Shimmer Tag Team Title defense in Shimmer, defeating the team of Cheerleader Melissa and Shimmer Champion MsChif.
On April 2, 2011, Daizee Haze and Tomoka Nakagawa defended the title for the first time on pay-per-view as part of Ring of Honor's Honor Takes Center Stage event in Atlanta, Georgia, defeating the team of Ayumi Kurihara and Hiroyo Matsumoto.
On February 22, 2012, Ayako Hamada and Ayumi Kurihara defended the title for the first time outside of North America, when they defeated Hiroyo Matsumoto and Misaki Ohata at a "Joshi 4 Hope" event in Tokyo, Japan.
On July 7, 2012, the Canadian NINJAs won the title for the second time, making them the first team (and individuals in Matthews and Perez) in Shimmer history to do so with any of their championships, when they defeated Courtney Rush and Sara Del Rey for the championships at NCW Femmes Fatales in Montreal, Quebec, Canada - which also meant that a Shimmer championship changed hands outside of Berwyn and the United States for the first time. They lost the title to the Global Green Gangsters (Kellie Skater and Tomoka Nakagawa) on Volume 57, making Nakagawa also a two-time champion.
Current champions.
The current champions are the Global Green Gangsters (Kellie Skater and Tomoka Nakagawa), who are in their first reign as a team. Individually, this is the first reign for Skater and the second for Nakagawa. They defeated previous champions the Canadian NINJAs (Nicole Matthews and Portia Perez) on April 14, 2013, in Berwyn, Illinois.

History.
The first mention of Lipno comes from 1486 when King Casimir IV Jagiellon gave Lipno someone named Pietruszek which was royal secretary. Lipno was originally a village on the edge of Białowieża Forest and near running through the nearby Sarnaki the Royal Route Krakow - Vilnius . Casimir's decision confirmed in 1525 by King Sigismund I the Old and Lipno until the 1864 was the village that belonged to the nobility. In the 80s 16th century Lipno was part of the "klimczycka group" consisting of three villages (Lipno, Klimczyce, Sarnaki) belonging to the family Kosiński. The period of the wars of the 17th century had a great impact on the history of the village. In memory of people, handed down from generation to generation , preserved picture of the struggle fought by a group of villagers from the Swedish troops during the Deluge. Lipno, from 1513 until 1795, was part of the set up by the decision of King Sigismund the Old , the capital of Podlaskie Viovodeship in Drohiczyn (from the Union of Lublin since 1569 area of the region became part of the Crown). After the Third Partition of Poland, southern part of the province, separated by the river Bug found since 1809 was under the rule of Austria. From 1809 Lipno and surroundings were part of the Duchy of Warsaw (created in 1807), since 1815 Lipno was for more than a century one of the many villages, formed the Congress of Vienna, the Polish Kingdom. In the 19th century the village belonged to the property Klimczyce owned by the family Podczaski. In 1827 there were 31 houses and 200 inhabitants, in 1880, 40 houses inhabited by 396 people during the procession in the 984 acres of land. In 1962, in the village inhabited by 530 people. Through the efforts of residents Lipno in 1910 was funded statue of Mary, the mother of Jesus set on the road leading to the Sarnaki. Figure was a place of prayers and meetings residents of the village. In 1933, the figure was in the middle of a newly built chapel on the same site. During the World War II in the area operated partisan included in the fifth Wilno Brigade AK, using the help of the local population, for which after the war, some residents were persecuted by UB. In Warsaw, Polish People’s Party deputies filed parliamentary questions on harassment by UB population of the Gmina Sarnaki and village Lipno, which then belonged to this municipality.
Lipno today.
Currently, Lipno is a developing village. The area has a lot of apple and cherry orchards, which are the main source of income for residents of Lipno. In winter you can find a number of Belarusian citizens who are buying apples from local growers. The village is popularly known as "Sweden" and residents "Swedes”, it is connected with the fact that at the end of the 19th century in the village during archaeological excavations had been found numerous remains of the troops of the Deluge period.

Celestina Boninsegna

Celestina Boninsegna (26 February 1877 – 14 February 1947) was an Italian operatic soprano, known for her interpretations of the heroines in Verdi's operas. Although particularly eminent in Verdi's works, she sang a wide repertoire during her 25-year career, including Rosaura in the world premiere of Mascagni's "Le maschere". Boninsegna made many recordings between 1904 and 1918, and her voice was one of the most successfully captured on disc during that period.
Career.
Boninsegna was born in Reggio Emilia, where she began to study singing in her youth with Guglielmo Mattioli. She made her professional opera debut at the unusually young age of 15, singing Norina in "Don Pasquale". Boninsegna entered the Conservatorio Gioachino Rossini in Pesaro shortly thereafter, where she studied under Virginia Boccabadati. 
In 1897, she made her operatic début at Bari as Marguerite in Gounod's "Faust". Subsequently, she sang Rosaura in the first Rome performance of Mascagni's "Le maschere". This was followed by many engagements throughout Italy, elsewhere in mainland Europe, Great Britain and the United States, including at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London (in 1904), La Scala, Milan (1904–5), the Teatro Real, Madrid (1905–6), and the Metropolitan Opera, New York City (1906–7). She also appeared in Boston (in 1909–10), at the Liceu, Barcelona (1911–12), at the Mariinsky Theatre, St Petersburg (1914)—and at numerous less important venues in her homeland and abroad. 
She retired from the stage in 1921 and spent the next two decades teaching singing. Amongst her pupils was the Australian dramatic soprano Margherita Grandi.
Boninsegna possessed a rich, resonant voice with a wide compass that was particularly suited to Verdi's music. In Italy in the 1900-1920 period, she was considered to be one of the finest interpreters of several Verdi heroines, including the title role in "Aïda", Amelia in "Un ballo in maschera", and Leonora in both "Il trovatore" and "La forza del destino". Critics particularly admired her relatively smooth vocal delivery and the dignity and refinement that she gave to the vocal lines of the music at hand, although—as the opera commentator and record reviewer Michael Scott details in "The Record of Singing" (Duckworth, London, 1977)—her technique was not impeccable, with her ripe lowest register not fully integrated with the upper parts of her voice. (See also the "New York Times" of 22 December 1906 for a review of her first Met Aïda and a summary of her vocal strengths and weaknesses.)
In an era of dynamic and passionate singing-actresses (such as Gemma Bellincioni, Eugenia Burzio and Rosina Storchio in Italy and Emmy Destinn in New York), Boninsegna's acting skills were dull in comparison, and her career suffered to some extent as a result. Furthermore, with the exception of the part of Santuzza in "Cavalleria rusticana" and the title role in Puccini's "Tosca", Boninsegna was either unfamiliar with, or simply not cast in, the verismo repertory which was highly popular during the time that she was performing—a problem that prejudiced her career. Nonetheless, she did achieve considerable success on 78-rpm gramophone records, being one of the first lyric-dramatic sopranos whose voice recorded well.
She died in Milan in 1947.
Recordings.
For her day, Boninsegna was a prolific recording artist. She recorded 106 sides, nearly as many as the combined output of her contemporaries Olive Fremstad, Emma Eames, Lillian Nordica, and Marcella Sembrich. She began to record in 1904 for Gramophone & Typewriter Milan with "In quelle trine morbide" from "Manon Lescaut" and went on to make over thirty recordings for that label by 1918. She also recorded for Pathé, Edison, His Master's Voice and Columbia. Her Columbia recordings, made between 1909 and 1910, were amongst her most acclaimed and were later issued on LP. Many arias from her recordings, including those made for Columbia, are available on CD:

Canal Park (Akron, Ohio)

Canal Park is a baseball stadium located in Akron, Ohio, United States, that is the home of the Akron RubberDucks of the Eastern League. The team is a double-A minor-league affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. The stadium was designed by Populous, the same architectural firm that designed Jacobs Field, the Indians' stadium that opened three years earlier. The stadium takes its name from its location adjacent to the Ohio and Erie Canal, which runs behind the left-field wall.
The stadium is designed as a single deck with the concourse at the top. All seats for RubberDucks games are sold for one price, regardless of number of rows from the field, except for right-field bleacher seating which is one dollar less. Seats extend all the way from one foul pole to the other (farther than most other parks at this level), and most sections contain 20 to 25 rows, although they taper to as little as five in the corners.
A series of 25 luxury boxes, and the press box, covers the concourse and the top few rows of seats from first base around to third base. The walkway down the right-field line is also covered, and contains a restaurant and the RubberDucks' team shop. A picnic berm in left field is available for pre-game rental by groups of 25 or more.
During the 2006 Akron Aeros season, the team celebrated its 10th season in Canal Park with several events. 
Aside from Akron RubberDucks baseball, Canal Park will occasionally host special events such as local high school and college baseball, and the Akron Marathon.
Scoreboard.
In August 2006, the park completed the installation of a new 18'x25' digital scoreboard to replace the original board with light bulbs. The new board has full color animation capacity and features a four color matrix display. The $386,000 project was originally expected to be completed in early July. The entire scoreboard measures 56¼'x68' and is the largest free-standing scoreboard in minor league baseball.
In January 2013, The Aeros' new management announced plans to install a new scoreboard which will be 26ft high and 68ft wide and would cost $1.65 million. The scoreboard was completed in time for the start of the 2013 season, as well as a new smaller outfield display board near the picnic tables.

Cléoma Falcon

Cléoma Falcon (née Breaux) (May 27, 1906 – April 4, 1941) was a Cajun guitarist and vocalist born in southwest Crowley, Louisiana. She is best known for being the wife of Joe Falcon as well as being one of the first people to record Cajun Music. The song "Allons à Lafayette" was recorded on April 27, 1928 in New Orleans. Afterwards, she performed across southern Louisiana and Texas.
Family.
Cléoma was born into a musical family. She was the daughter of Auguste Breaux, a Cajun accordion player, and Mathilda Schnexnayder. She also had three brothers Orphy, Clifford, and Amadee with whom she had recorded many albums. Cléoma and her husband had an adopted daughter named Lulu who they brought to dances.
Music career.
Cléoma had an enormous impact on Cajun music. At the time, women had a significantly smaller presence in Cajun Music. Her vocals and guitar skills fascinated many people. This made her recordings very successful. Besides a successful recording career, she frequently performed in dancehalls, which was considered improper. However, she overcame this stigma, most probably because she was alongside Joe Falcon. She recorded until 1940, when she was seriously injured by a car. She was run over and dragging for a quarter of a mile by her sweater and died from her injuries the following year. Cléoma's importance to Cajun music was recognized when she was the first woman to be inducted into the Cajun Music Hall of Fame in 2002.

HMS Ariel (1777)

HMS "Ariel" was a 20-gun "Sphinx"-class sixth-rate post ship of the Royal Navy. The French captured her in 1779, and she served during the American Revolutionary War for them and the Americans as well as the British. She was scuttled in 1793.
British career.
She was ordered from John Perry & Co.'s Blackwall Yard on 3 July 1776, was laid down that month and was launched on 7 July 1777. She was commissioned under Captain John Jackson, and cruised in the North Sea in August 1777. After a brief spell off the Norwegian and Danish coasts, she sailed for North America on 7 November. 
In 1778 she captured several American vessels. While "Ariel" was under the command of John Becher on 31 March, she shared in the capture of the frigate USS "Virginia". (The Royal Navy took "Virginia" into service as HMS "Virginia".)
On 4 June "Ariel" captured the sloop "Fanny". Then on 27 August 1778 she captured the 16-gun "Congress" brig USS "Resistance". "Resistance" had sailed from Boston armed for war and in quest of the French fleet. "Ariel" burnt her.
"Ariel" also shared in the prize money for a number of vessels captured between 2 January and 14 September. These were the sloops "Betsy" and "Polly", brigs "MCleary", "Reprizal", "Argyle". and "Postillion", the schooner "Chelsea", and the snow "David".
"Ariel" then passed under the command of Captain Charles Phipps. Phipps and "Ariel" captured the American privateer "New Broom" on 22 October 1778, as well as the schooners "Lark" and "Three Friends". "New Broom" was armed with 16 guns and had sailed from New London when "Ariel" and stopped her off Nantucket shoals. The next year, in February, Captain Thomas Mackenzie replaced Phipps.
Capture.
On 11 September 1779, whilst the "Ariel" was cruising off Charles Town, she sighted a strange sail and approached to investigate, unaware that the French fleet under Admiral d'Estaing had entered the theatre. As Mackenzie got closer he realized that the stranger was actually a frigate, accompanied by two brigs and a schooner, and that she was not responding to his signals, he decided to sail for the Georgia shore. The frigate gradually overhauled "Ariel" and Mackenzie finally decided to stand and fight. The enemy vessel was the 32-gun French "Amazone". After a ninety-minute flight in which "Ariel" lost her mizzen-mast and all her rigging and sustained casualties of four men dead and another 20 wounded, Mackenzie surrendered "Ariel". d'Estaing immediately exchanged the crew of "Ariel" and , which he had captured the year before, for French prisoners. The crews of these two vessels then went to man a variety of British vessels on the station. The French took the captured ship into service as "Ariel".
"Ariel" underwent repair and refitting at Lorient between March and October 1780. The French lent her to the American Continental Navy in October, where she served briefly as USS "Ariel".
USS "Ariel".
John Paul Jones assumed command of "Ariel" in France. He changed her rigging to improve her sailing qualities and removed 10 of her 26 guns to make room for more cargo. However, loading the ship and the need to obtain other vessels to carry the surplus cargo which "Ariel" could not hold delayed her departure. "Ariel" — accompanied by merchantmen "Luke" and "Duke of Leinster", which Benjamin Franklin had chartered to take care of the surplus supplies — departed L'Orient on 5 September, but contrary winds held them up in Groix Roads for over a month. The trio finally put to sea on 7 October. However, the next day one of the most severe storms in the history of the French coast broke and wreaked great havoc in the area, destroying many ships. "Ariel" lost all of her masts, sprang leaks, and suffered much other damage. Only Jones' superb seamanship enabled her to stay afloat and then to limp back into Groix Roads under a jury rig on the morning of 12 October. 
"Luke"—faster and less damaged than "Ariel"—also managed to get back to port, but sailed independently before "Ariel"s repairs could be completed; a British warship then captured "Luke". No record has been found of "Duke of Leinster" after her departure on 7 October, so it is quite possible that she foundered during the hurricane. 
More than two months passed before "Ariel" was again seaworthy. She finally got underway again on 18 October. Jones left much of "Ariel"s armament in France so he followed a southern route in the hope of avoiding encountering the Royal Navy.
Still, when "Ariel" had reached a point some 200 miles north of the Leeward Islands, a lookout reported a large ship which soon began to approach "Ariel". Rather than risk his only partially armed ship and the vital cargo and dispatches which she was carrying, Jones reluctantly had "Ariel" take to her heels. Jones hoped that she would shake off her pursuer during the night, but the stranger was in full sight when daylight returned the following morning, closer than she had been when last seen the previous evening. 
Jones then decided to try to pass "Ariel" off as a British warship. When his pursuer reached hailing distance, Jones demanded that her captain identify himself and his ship. The stranger was the 20-gun British privateer "Triumph" commanded by John Pindar. Jones then ordered Pindar to come on board "Ariel" with documents to verify his statements. When Pindar did not do so, Jones opened fire and forced his surprised enemy to surrender following a short and one-sided struggle. However, after "Triumph" had struck her colors, Pindar maneuvered his ship to "Ariel"s weather bow while the latter was lowering a boat for a prize crew and then quickly sailed away.
This engagement was John Paul Jones' last battle in the cause of American freedom, but he soon had to deal with trouble of another sort, a budding mutiny. After uncovering a plot to take over the ship by the English seamen whom he had enlisted from among British prisoners of war in France to fill out a crew built around survivors from "Bonhomme Richard", he put the troublemakers in irons. The rest of her voyage was uneventful; "Ariel" finally reached Philadelphia with her badly needed military stores—which included 437 barrels of gunpowder, 146 chests of arms, a large quantity of shot, sheet lead, and much medicine—on 18 February 1781. 
At the beginning of March, "Ariel"—still in port discharging her cargo—fired a salute to celebrate Maryland's ratification of the Articles of Confederation activating the new nation's first central government. 
Early in June 1781, Jones turned "Ariel" over to Anne-César, Chevalier de la Luzerne-the French minister to the United States—who manned her with a French crew for the voyage back to France.
"Ariel".
In September 1782 "Ariel" and "Surveillante" captured the merchant vessel "Grand Duc" off the coast of Spain. The French navy briefly took "Grand Duc" into service before decommissioning, striking off and selling her for £t 72,489 at Brest in 1783.
Fate.
After the French defeat at Neerwinden, her crew scuttled "Ariel" on the Scheldt in March 1793. The citizens of Bruges carried off her armament and stores.

BuddyScript

BuddyScript is a domain-specific language originally developed by ActiveBuddy. The main purpose of the language is to be able to process natural language queries and return results in natural language form.
It was the core language for the famous SmarterChild and Windows Live Agents which were IM/Web based robots. As the Windows Live Agents SDK has been retired by Microsoft, the future of BuddyScript is uncertain.
Like Python BuddyScript uses whitespace indentation to delimit blocks (also known as off-side rule).
