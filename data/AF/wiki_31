János Pach

János Pach (born May 3, 1954) is a mathematician and computer scientist working in the fields of combinatorics and discrete and computational geometry.
Biography.
Pach was born and grew up in Hungary. He comes from a noted academic family: his father, Zsigmond Pál Pach was a well known historian, and his uncle Pál Turán was one of the best known Hungarian mathematicians.
Pach received his Candidate degree from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, in 1983, where his advisor was Miklós Simonovits.
Since 1977, he has been affiliated with the Alfréd Rényi
Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
He was Research Professor at the Courant Institute of
Mathematics at NYU (since 1986), Distinguished Professor of
Computer Science at City College, CUNY (1992-2011), and Neilson
Professor at Smith College (2008-2009). In 2008, he joined École
Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne as Professor of Mathematics.
He was the program chair for the International Symposium on Graph
Drawing in 2004. With Herbert Edelsbrunner and Günter Ziegler, he
is co-editor-in-chief of the journal Discrete & Computational Geometry,
and he serves on the editorial boards of several other journals
including Combinatorica, SIAM Journal of Discrete Mathematics,
Computational Geometry, Graphs and Combinatorics, Central European
Journal of Mathematics, and Moscow Journal of Combinatorics and
Number Theory.
Research.
Pach has authored several books and over 200 research papers. He was one of the most frequent collaborators of Paul Erdős, authoring over 20 papers with him and thus has an Erdős number of one.
Pach's research is focused in the areas of combinatorics and discrete geometry.
In 1981, he solved Ulam's problem, showing that there exists
no universal planar graph.
In the early 90s 
together with Micha Perles, he initiated the systematic study of extremal problems on topological and
geometric graphs.
Some of Pach's most-cited research work concerns the combinatorial complexity of families of curves in the plane and their applications to motion planning problems the maximum number of k-sets and halving lines that a planar point set may have, crossing numbers of graphs, embedding of planar graphs onto fixed sets of points, and lower bounds for epsilon-nets.
Awards and honors.
Pach received the Grünwald Medal of the János Bolyai Mathematical Society (1982), the Ford Award from the Mathematical Association of America (1990), and the Alfréd Rényi Prize from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1992).
In 2011 he was listed as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery for his research in computational geometry.

History of the anchor

The History of the anchor dates back millennia. The most ancient anchors were probably rocks and many rock anchors have been found dating from at least the Bronze Age. Many modern moorings still rely on a large rock as the primary element of their design. However, using pure mass to resist the forces of a storm only works well as a permanent mooring; trying to move a large enough rock to another bay is nearly impossible.
The ancient Greeks used baskets of stones, large sacks filled with sand, and wooden logs filled with lead, which, according to Apollonius Rhodius and Stephen of Byzantium, were formed of stone; and Athenaeus states that they were sometimes made of wood. Such anchors held the vessel merely by their weight and by their friction along the bottom. Iron was afterwards introduced for the construction of anchors, and an improvement was made by forming them with teeth, or "flukes", to fasten themselves into the bottom.
Teeth.
The words and "dentes" (both meaning "teeth") are frequently used to denote anchors in Greek and Latin poems. The invention of the teeth is ascribed by Pliny to the Tuscans; but Pausanias gives the credit to Midas, king of Phrygia. Originally there was only one fluke or tooth, whence anchors were called ; but a second was added, according to Pliny, by Eupalamus, or, according to Strabo, by Anacharsis, the Scythian philosopher. The anchors with two teeth were called or , and from ancient monuments appear to have resembled generally those used in modern days except that the stock is absent from them all. Every ship had several anchors; the largest, corresponding to our sheet anchor, was used only in extreme danger, and was hence peculiarly termed or "sacra", whence the proverb "sacram anchram solvere", as flying to the last refuge.
The 19th century.
Until the beginning of the 19th century anchors were of imperfect manufacture, the means of effecting good and efficient welding being absent and the iron poor, whilst the arms, being straight, generally parted at the crown, when weighing from good holding-ground. A clerk in Plymouth Yard, named Pering, in the early part of that century (1813) introduced curved arms; and after 1852 the British admiralty anchor, under the direction of the Board, was supplied to H.M. ships, followed by Lieutenant ("afterwards Captain") Rodger's anchor. Rodger's anchor marked a great departure from the form of previous anchors. The arms were formed in one piece, and were pivoted at the crown on a bolt passing through the forked shank. The points or pees to the palms were blunt. This anchor had an excellent reputation amongst nautical men of that period, and by the committee on anchors, appointed by the British admiralty in 1852, it was placed second only to the anchor of Trotman.
Later came the self-canting and close-stowing Martin anchor, which, passing through successive improvements, became the improved Martin anchor made of forged iron. A projection in the center of the arms works in a recess at the hub of the shank; the vacancies outside the shank are filled by blocks bolted through on each side, and are flush with the side plates, which keep the flukes in position.
The introduction of cast steel in 1894 led to the improved Martin-Adelphi pattern, in which the crown and arms are cast in one, and, with the stock, are made of cast steel, the shank remaining of forged iron. A projection in the crown works in a recess (right image), and is secured in its place by a forged steel pin, fitted with a nut and washer, which passes through the crown and the heel of the shank.
All of the above anchors were provide with a stock, the use of which is to "cant" the anchor. If it falls on the ground, resting on one arm and one stock, when a strain is brought on the cable, the stock cants the anchor, causing the arms to lie at a downward angle to the holding ground; and the pees enter and bury themselves below the surface of the soil.
Stockless anchors have been extensively used in the British mercantile marine and in some other navies. In 1903 they were adopted generally for the British Navy, after extensive anchor trials, begun in 1885. Their advantages are: handiness combined with a saving of time and labor; absence of davits, anchor-beds, and other gear, with a resulting reduction in weight; and a clear forecastyle for "right ahead" gun fire or for working ship. On the other hand a larger hawsepipe is required, and there appears to be a consensus that a stockless anchor, when "let go" does not hold so quickly as a stocked one, is more uncertain in its action over uneven ground, and is more liable to "come home" (drag).
The 20th century.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the stockless anchors principally in use in the British navy are Hall's improved, Byer's, and Wasteneys Smith's.
In Hall's improved anchor, the arms and crown of cast steel are in one piece, and the shank of forged steel passes up through an aperture in the crown to which it is secured by two cross bolts. Two trunnions or lugs are forged to the lower end of the shank.
In W.L. Byer's plan, the flukes and crown consist of a steel-casting secured to a forged shank by a through bolt of mild steel, the axis of which is parallel to the points of the flukes; one end of the bolt has a head, but the other is screwed and fitted with a phosphor bronze nut to allow the bolt to be withdrawn for examination. A palm is cast on each side of the crown to trip the flukes when the anchor is on the ground, and for bringing them snug against the ship's side when weighing.
Wasteneys Smith's anchor is composed of three main parts, the shank and crown which form one forging, and the two flukes or arms which are separate castings. A bolt passes through the crown of the anchor, connecting the flukes to it; to prevent the flukes working off the connecting through bolt, two smaller bolts pass though the flukes at right angles to the through bolt and are recessed half their diameter into it.
Small boat anchor patterns.
Small boat anchors have developed a bit separately from the first half of the 20th century, with the advent of the "CQR", developed by Geoffrey Ingram Taylor of Scotland in the early 1930s. This design was not symmetrical, and required the use of a bow-roller design to effectively stow it. This is practical for small boats and yachts, but does not scale in a practical manner for large shipping. The CQR is now manufactured by Lewmar.
American Richard Danforth invented and developed the "Danforth" pattern in the 1940s, a return to the symmetrical concept but with very large flat plate flukes. This anchor offers very good holding power for its weight (high efficiency) but does not perform well in other respects, meaning that it is not a good general purpose anchor. The original Danforth is still manufactured and sold by Tie Down Engineering in the USA.
Peter Bruce of the Isle of Man in the UK developed the claw-type "Bruce" anchor in the 1970s. Bruce Anchor Co has its primary role in the very large anchor business, producing mooring anchors and permanent installation types for heavy industry, such as oilrigs. On the back of this reputation, the Bruce small boat anchor type was initially very successful, and represented some significant improvements over the CQR. It is no longer produced.
New generation anchors have come into force since the latter part of the 20th century. The German "Buegelanker" features a simple single flat triangular fluke, with a roll-bar to ensure correct setting. A surprisingly simple design, this has proven more effective than its ancestors. Frenchman Alain Poiraud developed the "Spade" anchor in the 1990s, a huge leap in performance over any types which proceeded it. The Spade was the first anchor to successfully make use of a concave fluke, which provides the greatest efficiency (as opposed to the convex "plow" type of the CQR, or the flat "plate" type of the Danforth).
The 21st century.
Continued development of small boat anchor patterns.
The "Bulwagga" is essentially a modified fluke style anchor which made itself known at the very beginning of the 2000s. Rather than two flukes in a symmetrical configuration, it adds a third for an equilateral triangular arrangement. This concept is an improvement over the Danforth in terms of general purpose usage, but is slightly comparatively inefficient (on account of the fact that one fluke is always unused), and is difficult to stow.
New Zealander Peter Smith in the early 2000s took elements of the Spade and other types, and developed unique solutions of his own, in order to design the "Rocna" anchor, a general purpose type which uses a concave fluke, a self-righting roll-bar, and setting skids.

Lsmod

lsmod is a command on Linux systems which prints the contents of the /proc/modules file. It shows which loadable kernel modules are currently loaded.
Abridged example output: 
"Module" denotes the name of the module. "Size" denotes the size of the module (not memory used). "Used by" denotes each module's use count and a list of referring modules. The "Used by" list is sometimes incomplete. If the module controls its own unloading via a can_unload routine then the use count displayed by lsmod is always -1, irrespective of the real use count.

Martin Scheinin

Martin Scheinin (born 4 November 1954) was the first United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism. He was selected for this position after serving for eight years (1997-2004) as member of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the independent expert body monitoring states' compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. While on the Committee, he was known as a defendant of the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples and opponent of capital punishment, as well as the drafter of the Committee's General Comment No. 29 on states of emergency.
Today he is a Professor of Public International Law at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, and an expert of international law, human rights and constitutional law. In December 2010 Scheinin was elected President of the International Association of Constitutional Law.
Education.
Scheinin was born on 4 November 1954 in Helsinki, Finland, and was educated in law at the Universities of Turku and Helsinki.
Academic career.
Scheinin received his doctorate in law from the University of Helsinki in 1991. Scheinin was professor of law for fifteen years in Finland, first at the University of Helsinki (1993-1998) and then at Åbo Akademi University (1998-2008) where he was also the Director of the Institute for Human Rights, before moving to Florence in 2008 to take up office as Professor of Public International Law at the European University Institute.
At the European University Institute, Scheinin's areas of research and supervision include public international law, human rights law, international criminal law, comparative constitutional law and anti-terrorism legislation. He is the Coordinator of the FP7-research project SURVEILLE (Surveillance: Ethical Issues, Legal Limitations, and Efficiency), and was earlier the Work Package leader in the research project DETECTER (Detection Technologies, Terrorism, Ethics, and Human Rights) under the European Union Framework 7 Security Programme. He is also the coordinator of the research strand GLOTHRO (Beyond Territoriality: Globalisation and Transnational Human Rights Obligations) within the EUI Global Governance Programme.
His professional experience also includes working for the Parliament of Finland, the Finnish Ministry of Justice and three governmental commissions that drafted amendments to the Finnish Constitution, including the 1995 fundamental rights reform. He has taught courses on human rights or counter-terrorism in many parts of the world, including at the University of Melbourne, University of Pretoria, and the University of Toronto, and for professional target groups such as judges, lawyers or prosecutors in Egypt, Latvia, and the Russian Federation.
In December 2010 Scheinin was elected President of the International Association of Constitutional Law.
Work with the UN.
Scheinin has worked with the UN on human rights issues since 1997, first as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, and from 2005 until 2011 as Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism.
Special Rapporteur.
In April 2005, the UN Commission on Human Rights appointed "a special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism". This was initially a three-year appointment, to end in 2008, but was later extended by three more years, to end in 2011.
As Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, Scheinin reported annually both to the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Human Rights Council. His reports have covered themes such as definitions of terrorism, the right to fair trial in terrorism cases, the impact of counter-terrorism measures on economic, social and cultural rights, the right to privacy in the age of counter-terrorism, the role of intelligence agencies and their oversight in counter-terrorism, and the identification of best practice in combating terrorism in full compliance with human rights.
Some of the reports have been commended by governments, such as those related to discriminatory profiling or the right to privacy in the context of counter-terrorism. On some other occasions, certain governments have been highly critical about the reports, such as Scheinin's analysis of the impact of counter-terrorism measures and his proposals of a total reform of the terrorist listing by the United Nations Security Council.
As Special Rapporteur, Scheinin was a member of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) and has conducted a number of country visits to assess the counter-terrorism law and practice of countries such as Turkey, South Africa, United States, Israel, Spain, Egypt, Tunisia and Peru. As part of the country missions, he visited prisons and observed terrorism trials, such as the Military Commission hearings in the Hamdan case in Guantanamo Bay and the Jose Padilla and Ahmed Ghailani trials in the United States. The country visits have often resulted in concrete improvements, such as the repeal of a contested Presidential Decree in Peru immediately after the visit in September 2010. As Special Rapporteurs can visit a country only upon the invitation of its government, Scheinin has not been able to obtain access to countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, or the Russian Federation.
Scheinin's mandate as Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism ended on 31 July 2011. He was succeeded by Ben Emmerson, Q.C. (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), who assumed this mandate on 1 August 2011.

Hindi in Bihar

Hindi is one of the two official languages of Bihar (the other being Urdu), whilst the majority of the people speak one of the Bihari languages - Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Maithili or Angika. Bihari languages were once mistakenly thought to be dialects of Hindi, but they has been more recently shown to be descendant of the language of the erstwhile Magadha kingdom - Magadhi Prakrit, along with Bengali and Oriya.
Hindi journalism.
"Biharbandhu" was the first Hindi newspaper published from Bihar. It was started in 1872 by Madan Mohan Bhatta, a Maharashtrian Brahman settled in Biharsharif. Hindi journalism in Bihar, and specially Patna, could make little headway initially. It was mainly due to lack of respect for Hindi among the people at large. Many Hindi journals took birth and after a lapse of time vanished. Many journals were shelved even in the embryo. But once Hindi enlisted the official support, it started making a dent into the remote areas in Bihar. Hindi journalism also acquired wisdom and maturity and its longevity was prolonged. Hindi was introduced in the law courts in Bihar in 1880.
20th century publications.
The beginning of the twentieth century was marked by a number of notable new publications. A monthly magazine named "Bharat Ratna" was started from Patna in 1901. It was followed by "Kshtriya Hitaishi", "Aryavarta" from Dinapure, Patna, "Udyoga" and "Chaitanya Chandrika". "Udyog" was edited by Vijyaanand Tripathy, a famous poet of the time and "Chaitanya Chandrika" by Krishna Chaitanya Goswami, a literary figures of that time. This literary activities were not confined to Patna alone but to many districts of Bihar.
Constitutional issues.
Despite of the large number of speakers of Bihari languages, they have not been constitutionally recognized in India. Hindi is the language used for educational and official matters in Bihar. These languages was legally absorbed under the subordinate label of HINDI in the 1961 Census. Such state and national politics are creating conditions for language endangerments.
Struggle between languages.
The first success for spreading Hindi occurred in Bihar in 1881, when Hindi displaced Urdu as the sole official language of the province. In this struggle between competing Hindi and Urdu, the potential claims of the three large mother tongues in the region - Magahi, Bhojpuri and Maithili were ignored. After independence Hindi was again given the sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950. Urdu became the second official language in the undivided State of Bihar on 16 August 1989.
Maithili has been the only one among the Bihari languages, which has been trying to constantly deny superimposition of Hindi over her identity. The other two have given up their claims and have resigned to accept the status of dialects of Hindi. Maithili was officially recognized by the government of India in 2003, after an active movement led by Maithili speakers.
Statistics.
The number of speakers of Bihari languages are difficult to indicate because of unreliable sources. In the urban region most educated speakers of the language name Hindi as their language because this is what they use in formal contexts and believe it to be the appropriate response because of unawareness. The uneducated and the rural population of the region return Hindi as the generic name for their language.

Telford, Tennessee

Telford is a census-designated place in Washington County, Tennessee, United States, located between Jonesborough and Limestone. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 921. The community is part of the Johnson City Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the "Tri-Cities" region.
The community was called Millwood in early times and continued so for many years. It was not until 1855, when Colonel George Whitfield Telford, a state senator who operated the Telford Manufacturing Company, donated about four acres of land to support local operations of the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, that the name Millwood was changed to Telford Depot. At a date sometime after 1876 the word "Depot" was discontinued and the single name Telford adopted.
During the Civil War, citizens of this part of Washington County voted to secede from the Confederacy, but they were unsuccessful in persuading others to do so. The independent nation called "Bricker's Republic" soon fell into relative obscurity. A Civil War battle took place in Telford on September 8, 1863, when the 100th Ohio Infantry clashed with the Confederate-aligned Thomas' Legion just east of the depot. The Confederate force was supported by 4-Howitzer artillery unit commanded by General Alfred "Mudwall" Jackson.

Martin Groß

Martin Groß was an Obersturmbannführer (Lieutenant Colonel), in the Waffen-SS (SS number 6684) during World War II.
Background.
He was born in Frankfurt on 15 April 1911. Information about his early life is sparse.
Career in the Waffen-SS.
He was a Battalion commander in the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler where he commanded the II/Battalion of the SS Panzer Regiment 1. It was when he was in command of this battalion, during the Battle of Kharkov in 1943, when he was awarded the Knight's Cross in July 1943 for a three-hour engagement when his battalion destroyed 90 Soviet tanks.
In August 1944, Groß was given command of a new Panzer Brigade, known as SS Panzer Brigade Gross. The brigade was formed from elements of the SS Panzer Troop Training and Replacement Regiment at Dundaga (), Latvia, along with SS Panzer Troop Training Regiment "Seelager". By 16 August, the brigade had attained a personnel strength of 2,500 and was attached to a new and temporary Divisional Command: Panzer Division Strachwitz.
The brigade first went into action against the Soviet 51st Army units in and around the town of Tukums on 20 August. In September, Brigade Gross was detached from Panzer Division Strachwitz and dispatched to the Tartu area to counter another Soviet offensive. The brigade fought in the Baltic area from September to October 1944.
In November the unit was withdrawn from the Baltic and sent to the Waffen SS Troop Training Area Sennelager near Danzig, East Prussia (present-day Gdańsk, Poland). From there it was sent to another training area in Westphalia. There the brigade was broken up and its men sent to the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich, 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and the 12th SS-Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, which were a part of the 6th Panzer Army. The disbanding of Brigade Gross was disguised as the forming of a new panzer regiment: SS-Panzer-Regiment 26 Reichsmarschall.
In March 1945 Groß was transferred to the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend and was the last commander of the SS Panzer Regiment 12.

LGBT rights in Bolivia

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Bolivia may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is legal in Bolivia.
Law regarding same-sex sexual activity.
Same-sex sexual activity is legal.
Discrimination protections.
Article 14(II) of the Constitution of Bolivia, implemented in February 2009, prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
Article 281ter. of the Penal Code criminalizes discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This law was added in 2010 by Article 23 of the Law Against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination.
These protections, however, are not always carried out. In April 2012, a Bolivian transgender woman was tortured, burned, and stabbed to death by a mob of hundreds in El Alto, La Paz. The police never arrested any suspects, although the torture and murder took place in broad daylight.
In December 2013 the Armed Forces announced intention to allow gays and lesbians to serve in its ranks from 2015.
Recognition of same-sex unions.
Article 63 of the constitution limits legally recognized marriage to opposite-sex unions.
In July 2010, Vice President Álvaro García Linera said that the government had no plans to legalize same-sex marriage. 
In April 2012, a member of the opposition coalition, the National Convergence, introduced a bill in the Plurinational Legislative Assembly to legalize same-sex civil unions. However, the bill has not advanced.
Adoption of children.
Bolivia allows both married and single people to adopt children.

Sunjoy Monga is a conservationist, photographer, and naturalist based in Mumbai in India. He was born in Masjid Bunder, one of Mumbai’s most congested localities adjacent to the docks and his earliest involvement with birds was to imitate the gutur... goo calls of pigeons, much to the delight of his family. A myriad rodents that thrived in the grain godowns of the area fascinated him just as much… ‘wildlife’ came to him very early in life.
He has authored several books including the much acclaimed 'City Forest' and has been a consultant to various projects. He has been associated with the Bombay Natural History Society. He has penned regular columns in several newspapers on the need for conservation, poaching, decreases in the city's flamingoe population, and the man-animal conflict in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park.
He has initiated an environmental awareness drive 'Young Rangers' amongst schools and school children across India. He is also been chosen on the elite Tumbhi advisory panel and will help discover and nurture photographic talent.

HMS Pictou (1813)

HMS "Pictou" was a 14-gun schooner that the Royal Navy captured in 1813. She served briefly on the Royal Navy's North American station, capturing one or two merchantmen before the American frigate USS "Constitution" captured and destroyed her during the War of 1812.
History.
The origins of "Pictou" are obscure. Some references report that she was the built as the American letter of marque "Syron". However, the most comprehensive listing of American letters of marque has no vessel by that name. Also, the "London Gazette" has no mention of the capture of any vessel with that name. Other references suggest that "Pictou" was originally a privateer by the name of "Bonne Foi". Again, there is no record in the "London Gazette" of a capture of a privateer with that name.
Admiralty records show that in October 1813 Admiral Sir John Warren, commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy's North American station, purchased "Syron" and renamed her "Pictou". Lieutenant Edward Stephens commissioned her. However, apparently "Pictou" was already serving the Royal Navy, and may well have been captured in the Caribbean.
On 12 May 1813, "Pictou" and arrived at Halifax with five vessels that they had convoyed from Bermuda.
One source states that on 19 September "Pictou" captured the brig "Isabella", of 126 tons (bm), which was sailing to Boston with a cargo of silk, wine, oil, etc. Another record gives the date as 19 August, and the captor as "Picton", although the Royal Navy had no vessel by that name. The records of the Halifax Vice Admiralty court gives the date of capture as 19 July, and reports that "Isabella" P. Slaygur, master, had been sailing from Algesiras to Boston carrying wine, silk, oil and cork. A third source has the capture date as 22 July. A fourth account has "Pictou" bringing "Isabella" into Halifax on 23 July, and otherwise is consistent with the third account.
"Pictou" recaptured the sloop "Ringdove" which the American privateer "Polly", of Salem had captured. "Polly" had also captured a schooner carrying a cargo of stone, but the schooner too had been recaptured.
Loss.
The USS "Constitution" captured and destroyed "Pictou" on 14 February 1814, windward of Barbados. At this time the ship was escorting the armed merchant "Lovely Ann" from Bermuda to Surinam. In the morning the "Constitution", under the command of Captain Charles Stewart, stopped "Pictou" with a shot through her sails and captured her. A few hours before, "Constitution" had already captured "Lovely Ann" and had taken her as a prize. Captain Stewart decided to keep the merchant vessel but commanded that "Pictou" be destroyed. "Pictou" was one of five British warships that "Constitution" captured or destroyed during the war.

MacKenzie received his PhD under Ernest Lawrence at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Lawrence, MacKenzie, and their colleagues devised the first cyclotron. He was a professor of physics at UCLA, where he and Reg Richardson built UCLA's first cyclotron and later a bevatron. MacKenzie devised MacKenzie buckets which are plasma sources created by lining vacuum chamber walls with permanent magnets of alternating polarity to suppress plasma electron losses, that are widely used to this day. He later traveled around the world, helping to troubleshoot various country's cyclotron problems. Later in life, he studied plasma physics and dark matter.

Madre de Dios Mine

Madre de Dios, located east the town of Máfil in Chile, is a placer deposit of gold that has been mined several times since its discovery in 1556. The bedrock of the Madre de Dios area is made of metamorphic and crystalline rocks of Paleozoic age all part of the Bahía Mansa Metamorphic Complex. These rocks are covered with thick layers of glacial gravel from the Tertiary. Gold eroded from the gravel have deposited in nearby streams, thus giving origin to the placer deposit. The deposit was discovered by Spaniards in 1556 but was not mined extensivelly until the late 19th century. 
From 1898 to 1936 a total of 2,6 tonnes of gold were produced. The deposits are currently being prospected by the Global Gold corporation.

Yasin al-Qadi

Yasin Abdullah Ezzedine al-Qadi (also spelled as Shaykh Yassin Abdullah Kadi or Yasin A. Kahdi) (b. 23 February 1955) is a Saudi Arabian businessman who has been described by friends and associates as a philanthropist. A multi-millionaire from Jeddah, Qadi trained as an architect in Chicago, IL. He is the son-in-law of Sheikh Ahmed Salah Jamjoom, a former Saudi Arabian government minister with close ties to the Saudi royal family.
The UN placed sanctions against Qadi in 1999 and 2000, when he was named by United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1267 and 1333 as a suspected associate of Osama bin Laden's terror network, al-Qaeda. On 12 October 2001, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) ordered his assets in the United States to be frozen. The European Union also applied sanctions to Qadi. In response, Qadi's lawyers brought two lawsuits now considered landmarks in public international law, known as "Kadi I" (2008) and "Kadi II" (2010). The case for which he is best known, a 2008 decision by the European Court of Justice, "Kadi I", is thought to have challenged "the core framework of UN terrorist sanctions and forces UN member states to tackle difficult legal questions or else face possible collapse of the UN’s terrorist sanctions regime."
Qadi's listing as a terrorist was overturned by several European courts, and his name was removed from blacklists by Switzerland (2007), the European Union (2008 and 2010), and the United Kingdom (2008 and 2010). On 13 September 2010, Yasin al-Qadi "succeeded in having dismissed in their entirety the civil claims brought against him in the United States on behalf of the families of the 9/11 victims." U.S. District Judge Daniels ruled that the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York had no jurisdiction over Qadi, who is a Saudi Arabian citizen. However, Qadi remains a "Specially Designated Global Terrorist" under U.S. law. On 19 March 2012, Judge John D. Bates in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia dismissed Qadi's 2009 lawsuit against officers of the U.S. Treasury, finding "that this claim must be dismissed because (1) the bill of attainder clause does not apply to acts taken by a regulatory agency and (2) even if it did, the clause is not triggered here, because there was no action constituting "punishment." On 5 October 2012, the UN Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against al-Qaeda granted Qadi's petition to be removed from its blacklist.
Early Life and Family.
Qadi was born 23 February 1955 in Cairo, Egypt. His father became a successful businessman in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He has five sisters and no brothers.
Around 1977, Qadi earned a bachelor's degree in architectural engineering from Alexandria University in Cairo, Egypt, and subsequently moved to Chicago, IL, where he worked for an architectural firm from July 1979 to February 1981. He helped the firm develop a master plan and contract documentation for the Mecca Campus of the King Abdulaziz University.
Yasin al-Qadi married a daughter of Sheikh Ahmed Salah Jamjoom sometime before 1981., He and his wife have seven children, including a son who is a U.S. citizen.
Business and nonprofit ventures.
In 1980, Qadi became a vice president of the Jamjoom Group, a multi-national conglomerate headquartered in Jeddah. Around 1986, Yasin al-Qadi became one of the principal investors in BMI Inc., a Shariah-compliant investment bank based in New Jersey.
Qadi inherited "several million dollars" in 1988. In 1990, he began to establish close business associations with Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz, whose family owned a majority interest in Saudi Arabia's largest bank, the National Commercial Bank. Qadi said that he was brought in to maintain good financial relations with pious Muslims throughout the Islamic world, by building a more shariah-compliant banking network for the bank. "We devised systems of leasing and ways to borrow money" that could be used by pious Muslims, who are not allowed to charge interest, Qadi told the "Chicago Tribune".
In May 1992, Qadi created the Muwafaq Foundation, an Islamic charity incorporated for the stated purpose of providing famine relief and education in the Islamic world, particularly Pakistan. The charity was incorporated as a trust on the island of Jersey, an off-shore tax haven located near the coast of Normandy, France. Qadi personally donated about $15 to $20 million from his fortune, and solicited donations from bin Mahfouz and other wealthy Saudi families. Bin Mahfouz became a principal donor but later said that he was not involved in the operation of the charity after its establishment.
A similarly named organization, the "Muwaffaq Society" or "Muwaffaq Ltd.," was registered in the Isle of Man in June 1991, but Qadi denied any relationship to this entity.
Plaintiffs who have filed suit against Qadi and his associates claim that Muwafaq was a charitable front used to funnel money to al-Qaeda.
In 1994, Qadi helped raised the original $5 million of the $20 million used to fund a software firm called Ptech Inc., a Massachusetts-based company that was closed down in late 2003 as a consequence to the media frenzy following the consented search on December 5, 2002 by federal authorities under the auspices of Operation Green Quest. The stated goal of the company was to market enterprise architecture to government agencies.
In 1996, Qadi became one of the original founders and financial supporters of the Dar Al-Hekma Private College for Girls, a "path-breaking Saudi women's college" based in Jeddah. At the time of the September 11 attacks, he was serving as the Secretary-General of the college. Qadi is no longer listed on the Dar Al-Hekma College website.
Business activity after 2001.
According to counterterrorism expert Victor D. Comras, "Al Kadi is believed to have acted swiftly after 9/11 to restructure many of his business interests and, while retaining actual control, placed many of his own assets into the hands of nominal managers and directors."
Comras says that, despite his designation as a global terrorist, Qadi continued do business as
In 2005, the New York Times estimated that Qadi’s net worth "exceeds $65 million." Another estimate calls him a billionaire, citing his extensive international business holdings.
Continues to work for National Commercial Bank.
Qadi has stated in court records that he was "a member of the Islamic Banking Services Committee, which was formed by the National Commercial Bank in 1997 and on which I served until December 8, 2009. This is a committee responsible for the strategic development of Islamic banking services which was chaired by the CEO of the NCB. I served on this banking committee with other senior banking officials."
In other words, Qadi continued to work until 2009 for the very same Saudi bank that had been accused by British intelligence and U.S. intelligence sources of transferring $3 million in "protection money" to Osama bin Laden back in 1999.
Terrorism blacklist.
Tied to Muslim Brotherhood.
Yasin al-Qadi is “tied to the Muslim Brotherhood,” says Victor D. Comras, one of five counterterrorism monitors selected by the UN Security Council to assemble reports for the Al Qaeda/Taliban Sanctions Committee. Comras and several other counterterrorism experts have examined Qadi's business ties with leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood in great detail.
Dr. Ahmed El-Kadi (Al-Qadi), head of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States between 1984 and 1994, told the Chicago Tribune in September 2004 that his family, the El-Kadi or Al-Qadi family of Cairo, were “early Brotherhood members.”.
Yasin al-Qadi’s business dealings with leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, notably Suleiman Beheiri, Youssef Nada, and Abdurahman al-Amoudi, were alleged in several lawsuits filed after the 11 September attacks.
BMI.
According to court documents, BMI was "used as a financial conduit for al-Qaeda and Hamas supporters. The FBI discovered the true principals behind BMI were actually Yassin al-Qadi and Hamas leader Musa Abu Marzook."
Qadi says that his investment in BMI was “passive” and “entirely innocent.” He claims that he was not aware of a relationship between BMI and Marzook.
Meets with Osama bin Laden.
In an October 2001 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Qadi said that he met with Osama bin Laden at religious gatherings in the 1980s, but "he said the encounters were unremarkable at a time when bin Laden's battle against the Soviets in Afghanistan attracted U.S. government support and donations from Mosques around the United States."
In a December 2008 interview with the New York Times, Qadi added that he once met Osama bin Laden in Chicago. He gives the date as 1981.
Intrigued by this interview, Steven Coll, a biographer of the Bin Laden family tracked the story down and discovered that the date of the visit was 1979. Osama "was here for two weeks in 1979, it seems, and he visited Los Angeles and Indiana, among other places."
The date coincides with Qadi's arrival in Chicago in July 1979.
Coll gives as his source a 2009 biography written by Osama's first wife, Najwa Bin Laden.
1989: Meets Bin Laden in Pakistan.
Yasin al-Qadi told the New York Times in 2008 that he met with bin Laden in Pakistan in the late 1980s.
1991: Loan Linked to Hamas.
In 1991, Qadi loaned $820,000 to the Quranic Literacy Institute (QLI) of Oak Lawn, IL, a group formed to disseminate the Koran and Muslim texts. Al-Qadi told the Chicago Tribune he made the loan because of his friendship with the literacy institute's president, whom he met at a Sunday lecture in the Chicago area.
Qadi said the money was intended to allow the institute to make a land investment, which would yield profits that would support its charitable work.
But the FBI alleges in a 1998 affidavit that al-Qadi laundered his money through a DuPage County real estate deal to yield $107,000 that went to a small band of Hamas activists based in Illinois.
This group allegedly chose Muhammad Salah, a Jerusalem-born used-car dealer and grocery clerk living in Bridgeview, IL, to deliver the money to Hamas, a Palestinian organization that "funds West Bank medical clinics and Gaza Strip meal programs, while its website takes credit for a 'glory record' of 85 attacks against Israeli citizens and soldiers."
In January 1993, Israeli police arrested Salah as he tried to cross a Gaza Strip checkpoint and held him for questioning. "They charged Salah with passing out more than $100,000 to Hamas military cells in several West Bank and Gaza cities. Israeli authorities confiscated $96,400 more from Salah's East Jerusalem YMCA hotel room."
Salah told Israel he knew nothing about Hamas military activity and was distributing cash as a humanitarian activity.
1993: Al Qaeda moves to Boston.
In late March 1993, Newsweek reported that “virtually every principal figure implicated in the World Trade Center bombing” that took place in February 1993 has a connection to the Al-Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn, New York.
In April 1993, the Al-Kifah charity, which had more than 30 branches in cities throughout the U.S., closed down its Refugee Center in Brooklyn and moved its operational headquarters to the Al-Kifah branch in Boston, where it re-incorporated, sharing the same website and street address as Al-Kifah's Boston office, under a new name: Care International (not connected to the large charity of the same name based in Atlanta, GA).
In less than a year, two of the employees at Boston's Care International branch became employees at Ptech, Inc., a small Boston, MA software launched with money raised by Yasin al-Qadi.
1998: Funds Al-Iman University.
In 1998, Qadi donated money toward the construction of housing for students at Al-Iman University in Sanaa, Yemen. The university’s name is also translated as Iman University or Al-Eman.
A 2010 New York Times profile of the university indicates it is run by Muslims who follow Salafist practice, that is, a strict and puritanical form of Islam practiced by the Salafi (“ancestors” or first Muslims ). Al-Iman is “not a typical college,” says Glenn R. Simpson of the Wall Street Journal. “Its curriculum primarily concerns the study and propagation of radical Islam.”
Al-Iman’s founder, Sheikh Abdul Majeed al-Zindani, is a leader of the Yemen chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the U.S. Department of Treasury listed him as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist associated with al-Qaeda in 2004. .”
The Treasury Department has accused Zindani of “actively recruiting for al-Qaeda training camps.” Zindani has been sanctioned by the UN as well.
January - August 1998: Linked to Maram.
According to Glenn R. Simpson of the Wall Street Journal, Qadi's bank records show that, between January and August 1998, he transferred $1.25 million from his Geneva bank account through an associate to an alleged al-Qaeda front company in Turkey known as Maram. Founded as a travel agency and import-export business, the company Maram was reportedly established by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, said to be one of al-Qaeda’s founding members and to have a history of moving money and shopping for weapons for the organization.
Heavy surveillance of Maram began when Salim started shopping for equipment that could potentially have been used to make a nuclear weapon. He was arrested on 15 September 1998 near Munich, Germany.
A few months later, in December 1998, Qadi reportedly transferred shares in the company to two other men. One was Wael Hamza Julaidan, a Saudi businessman said to be a founder of al-Qaeda (the US officially designated Julaidan a financial supporter of al-Qaeda in 2002).
The other transferee was reported to be Mohammed Bayazid, another alleged founder of al-Qaeda.
On 20 December 1998 Salim was extradited to the United States, where he was charged with participating in the 1998 United States embassy bombings. In 2010, USA Today reported that he is an inmate of the ADX Florence facility in Florence, Colorado (reg.nr. 42426-054), sentenced to life without parole for stabbing a federal prison guard in the eye.
Suspect in 1998 U.S. Embassy Bombings.
The 1998 United States embassy bombings were a series of attacks that occurred on 7 August 1998, in which 223 people were killed in simultaneous truck bomb explosions at the United States embassies in the East African capitals of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya.
More than 4,000 people were injured.
The date of the bombings marked the eighth anniversary of the arrival of American forces in Saudi Arabia. The attacks were linked to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, brought Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to the attention of the American public for the first time, and resulted in the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation placing bin Laden on its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.
FBI Agents Richard Wright and John Vincent told ABC News they had begun an investigation of bin Laden's connections to the embassy bombings, and their investigation led to a financial network in the Chicago area. "The agents say some of the money for the attacks led back to the people they had been tracking in Chicago and to a powerful Saudi Arabian businessman, Yassin al-Kadi."
Qadi was "one of 12 Saudi businessmen suspected of funneling millions of dollars to al Qaeda and who had extensive business and financial ties in Chicago."
Wright later published the story of his frustrated investigation in a book titled "Operation Vulgar Betrayal."
1999 - 2001: Ptech, the FAA and 9/11.
Ptech, the Boston software firm which Yasin al-Qadi helped to fund in 1994, was a major contractor to US government agencies .
According to their own business plan for Ptech’s 1999 contract with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Ptech software team began working two years prior to 9/11 to identify potential problems or weaknesses in the FAA’s emergency response plans.
Specifically, Ptech was paid by the Federal Aviation Administration to find weaknesses in the FAA’s response plans for events like the terrorist hijacking of a plane over U.S. airspace.
Suheil Laher was a Ptech's software engineer. The Ptech team were “given access to every process and system in the FAA dealing with crisis response protocols.” This included examining key systems and infrastructure to analyze the FAA’s “network management, network security, configuration management, fault management, performance management, application administration, network management and user desk help operations.”
Their work was overseen by Hussein Ibrahim, Ptech's vice president and chief scientist. Ibrahim was an executive of BMI Inc. In fact, Ibrahim "served as vice president and then president of BMI Inc. from 1989 to 1995,"
According to Newsweek, Qadi's lawyers conceded, in 2002, that "it is possible a Qadi representative continued to sit on the company's board until recently."
Ptech’s software was running on the critical systems responding to 9/11 on 11 September itself. “The software was designed for the express purpose of giving its users a complete overview of all data flowing through an organization in real time.”
Blocked by Executive Order 13224.
On 23 September 2001, Executive Order 13224 blocked 27 foreign individuals, groups and entities that the United States “has determined to have committed or to pose a significant risk of committing or providing material support for acts of terrorism.”.
Yasin al-Qadi’s name appears on the list’s second tranche, a supplemental list of 39 more individuals designated on 12 October 2001.
Listed as terrorism suspect by U.S., UN and EU.
On 9 October 2001, the U.S. Department of Treasury sent out advanced copies of its new list of blocked individuals, prior to mass distribution to U.S. financial institutions on 11 October. An advanced copy was sent to the Swiss government’s Finance Administrator in Berne, Switzerland with a request for legal cooperation from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs.”
On 12 October 2001, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) officially put Qadi on its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists. His U.S. assets were immediately frozen. The decision was announced in a Treasury press release.
On 15 October, OFAC sent a letter to Qadi notifying him of his listing and the asset freeze, and advising him of his rights to request reconsideration.
Qadi was added to the UN list shortly afterward. Saudi Arabia "supported the addition of the Jeddah-based terrorist financier, Yasin al-Qadi, to the UN's consolidated list in October 2001," according to an official press release of the U.S. Treasury.
On 20 October, responding to the UN listing, the EU added Qadi to their list and froze his assets in EU countries.
On 26 October 2001, Qadi appeared for the first time on the U.S. Federal Register as a blocked person.
”Not found guilty of anything”.
Yasin al-Qadi was never formally charged with a crime by the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
“As is customary in such cases, Washington has presented no direct evidence linking Mr. Kadi to terrorism,” the New York Times reported in 2008. “But it has made public a dense labyrinth of associations and business and personal ties that it says establishes Mr. Kadi’s relationship with Mr. bin Laden and his allies.”
“We have not found Mr. Kadi guilty of anything,” Adam J. Szubin, director of OFAC, told the Times. “But we have found that he is a supporter of terror.”
"The post-911 credo became one of pre-emption and acting on suspicion,” says Marieke DeGoede in her 2012 book "Speculative Security: The Politics of Pursuing Terrorist Monies".
The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) uses its new powers to freeze assets "during the pendancy of an investigation," which means, effectively, that the government is able to stop the operations of charities suspected of being terrorist fronts “without any formal determination of wrongdoing."
Qadi, who has repeatedly claimed that he has given no support to terrorism, told the Times that the result was a legal paradox. When no criminal charge has been brought and the evidence on which the charges are based has been classified, “there is no way to defend yourself.”
December 2002: Brisard report given to UN Security Council.
Expert investigator Jean-Charles Brisard presented a report to the UN Security Council in December 2002 entitled “Terrorism Financing: Roots and Trends of Saudi Terrorism Financing” alleging that Qadi was “one of the main individual Saudi sponsors of Al-Qaeda.”
Al-Qadi denied the allegation as totally untrue. “I don’t have any connection, be it close or distant, with Al-Qaeda or its leader Bin Laden, either directly or indirectly,” Qadi told Asharq Al-Awsat, a sister publication of Arab News, in an interview.
2007: Zuhair Fayez acts as silent partner.
In his 29 August 2007 Wall Street Journal article "Well Connected, A Saudi Mogul Skirts Sanctions" Glenn R. Simpson reported that Yasin al-Qadi skirted UN sanctions placed against him by transferring his investments in the Turkish BIM supermarket chain to Zuhair Fayez, a friend and silent partner who held the money in 2004 through an off-shore company called Worldwide Ltd. in the Isle of Man.
Like Qadi, Fayez is a multi-millionaire architect from Jeddah. He owns a firm, Zuhair Fayez Partnership (ZFP), that has subcontracted on several projects with the Saudi Binladin Group, the construction firm run by the wealthy family of Osama bin Ladin.
Legal action.
December 2001: Appeals listing and asset freeze.
In December 2001, Qadi filed a challenge to the EU listing and asset freeze in the European Court of First Instance (General Court). His appeal was based on a claim that he had been denied fundamental due process.
On 21 December 2001, Qadi’s lawyers also petitioned the U.S. Department of Treasury (OFAC) for reconsideration of his listing and asset freeze.
Turkish protection.
After 11 September 2001, Yasin al-Qadi moved many of his operations to Istanbul, Turkey and Switzerland. "Forbes" reported that Qadi is a friend of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and that through his friendship with highly placed Turks he was able to escape sanctions while living in Turkey.
Cuneyd Zapsu, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Erdogan, reportedly donated tens of thousands of dollars to Qadi, and Zapsu's mother donated "a cool quarter million dollars."
Erdogan is quoted as having once said "“I know Mr. Qadi. I believe in him as I believe in myself. For Mr. Qadi to associate with a terrorist organization, or support one, is impossible.”
Yasin al-Qadi had a traffic accident on 16 February 2013 in Istanbul, Turkey while travelling from Istanbul Atatürk Airport by an official vehicle with Usama Qutub (his relative and business partner) and İbrahim Yıldız (Police Lieutenant at Prime Minister’s Guard Office). After the accident al-Qadi, Qutub and Yıldız were then taken to the Bağcılar Medipol Hospital for medical treatment. 
November 2002: Named as a defendant in 911 lawsuit.
On 15 August 2002, firefighters, rescue workers and more than 600 relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks filed a 15-count, $116 trillion lawsuit against Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Bin Laden Group, three Saudi princes, the government of Sudan, seven international banks, eight Islamic foundations, charities and subsidiaries, and many other defendants, including several individual terror financiers.
Yasin al-Qadi was added to the list of defendants on 22 November 2002, along with 50 more people and organizations, bringing the total number of defendants to 186. The amount of money sought was reduced to $1 trillion, but the number of plaintiffs soon increased to 2,500 after the suit was widely publicized.
Technically, Qadi was part of the "Third Amended Complaint" in the case of "Thomas E. Burnett, Sr., et al. v. Al Baraka Investment and Development Corporation, et al.", originally filed in the District of Columbia by attorneys from the Motley Rice Law Firm.
Informally, the case is called the "911 Lawsuit," and it is a landmark case that has been examined in great detail by legal scholars. In 2005 the case was combined with several other lawsuits to become "In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, MDL 1570," filed in the Southern District of New York. The case thus grew to more than 6,500 plaintiffs, collectively called "9/11 Families United to Bankrupt Terrorism."
March 2004: Delisting request denied by OFAC.
On 12 March 2004, OFAC issued a 20-page unclassified memorandum denying Qadi’s request for reconsideration.
OFAC determined that Qadi played "a significant leadership role" in the Muwafaq ("Blessed Success") Foundation, as one of six trustees, and the others "delegated . . . the running and the operation of the Foundation" to Qadi, who "was the driving force behind the administration of the foundation." He "effectively conceded that he directly supervised the individual country offices."
OFAC relied on Qadi's involvement in Muwafaq and, in particular, activities claimed to have occurred in Bosnia, Albania, Sudan and Pakistan, to conclude that "Kadi financially supported terrorist activities, primarily through Muwafaq, but also through other Kadi-owned entities." It considered Qadi's "relationship with and financial transfers to, designated terrorists Abdul Latif Saleh, Wa'el Julaidan, and Chariq Ayadi -- who were all involved in Muwafaq."
According to OFAC's findings, "Muwafaq gave logistical and financial support to Al-Gama'at Al-Islamiya, a mujahadin battalion in Bosnia that was designated as SGDT on October 31, 2001. The organization also transferred $500,000 to terrorist organizations in the Balkans in the mid-1990s."
OFAC found that Muwafaq "was involved in arms trafficking from Albania to Bosnia," and concluded that "as of late 2001, Kadi had continued to finance institutions and organizations in the Balkans after Muwafaq had ceased operations there, including two entities that were designated as SDGTs in early 2002 -- the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society's Pakistan and Afghanistan offices, and the Bosnia-Herzegovina branch of the Al-Haramain Foundation."
September 2004: Files complaint against Swiss prosecutor.
On 21 September 2004, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court ruled unanimously in Qadi's favor with regard to complaints brought by Qadi's lawyers against the Swiss prosecutor, Deputy Swiss Attorney General Claude Nicati. The Swiss court ordered that Qadi's lawyers be given full access to Nicati's entire file, including all notes taken by Nicati of his meeting with Jean-Charles Brisard.
“Brisard is the lead investigator for the US lawyers in the civil action brought in the US courts on behalf of the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and cannot therefore be regarded as independent,” his lawyers said. “Of particular concern to Al-Qadi was his discovery that Brisard passed to US lawyers documents he received from Nicati’s file in his capacity as expert."
On 27 March 2006, an extraordinary prosecutor appointed to investigate the matter concluded that Qadi's allegations were baseless and dismissed the action brought by Qadi. The prosecutor found that "there is no indication that the person you namely denounced, M. Jean-Charles BRISARD, or any of his assistants, had communicated information covered by the secrecy of the function he should have respected in the framework of the analysis mandate delivered to him by M. Claude NICATI Attorney General of Switzerland at the end of February 2004 in the case regarding your client."
2004: Accused of using university to launder money.
In response to a 2004 lawsuit brought by 911 families against Qadi in the Federal Criminal Court of Switzerland, Qadi denied that he knowingly used Al-Iman university as a front for laundering money to al-Qaeda. Qadi’s lawyers emphasized that the paper trail shows the money that he gave to Al-Iman University in 1998 did not buy arms, but was used to supply low-cost housing to students at a religious education facility.
September 2005: EU denies request for delisting.
In September 2005, the EU Court of First Instance (General Court) denied Qadi’s appeal, saying that compliance with EU law need not be considered because the UN Security Council has primacy. Qadi appealed to the EU Court of Justice.
December 2005: Wins case in Switzerland.
The Federal Criminal Court in Berne, Switzerland, "cleared Al-Qadi of any wrongdoing in a case stemming from the 9/11 attacks," his lawyers announced on 12 December 2005.
The charges alleged that Al-Qadi gave money in 1998 ostensibly to construct student housing at Al-Iman University in Yemen while knowing that the funds may have ended up supporting Al-Qaeda’s plan to attack New York City.
“I am very happy to know that my friend Al-Qadi has been cleared of all charges by the Swiss court,” Zuhair Fayez, a Jeddah-based architect, told Arab News on 25 December. He described Qadi as a reputable businessman and said the individuals and agencies that falsely accused Qadi of funding terrorism must be held responsible for damaging his reputation and interests.
December 2007: Delisted by Switzerland.
On 13 December 2007, based on the results of its own six-year investigation, a Swiss court decided to remove Qadi from its list of blocked terrorists. Arab News, a Saudi newspaper based in Jeddah, reported that Qadi was exonerated “on all charges” and said that his money in Swiss banks and the Geneva-based Faisal bank would be unfrozen.
Switzerland is not a member of the European Union and therefore had no obligation to comply with the EU listing.
September 2008: EU Court of Justice rules in favor of Qadi.
In 2008 the European Court of Justice overturned sanctions against Qadi by individual European Union governments, on the grounds the EU nations had not offered those sanctioned a chance for a judicial review.
On 3 September 2008, the EU Court of Justice (higher court) ruled in favor of Qadi, “saying UN agreements cannot have the effect of prejudicing constitutional principles agreed to in the treaty establishing the European Community. The court found the EU regulation allowing listing and asset freezes to breach fundamental human rights, since no evidence was communicated to Kadi, and the right of defence and effective judicial review were prejudiced. It gave EU authorities three months to remedy these defects, leaving the sanctions in place during that time.”
According to "Forbes Magazine" none of the bodies that has sanctioned Al Qadi has made public any of the evidence upon which the sanctions are based.
On 22 October 2008, Martin Scheinin, in a report to the United Nations Security Council, suggested greater openness and transparency for the reasons individuals and organizations were being sanctioned.
He stated:
November 2008: EU Commission renews listing and asset freeze.
In October 2008, the EU Commission (sanctions agency) provided to Qadi’s attorneys a brief summary of the UN’s reasons for listing Qadi, and they gave Qadi an opportunity for comment.
On 28 November 2008, the EU Commission renewed its listing and assets freeze against Qadi.
December 2008: Partially delisted by UK Treasury.
In December 2008, the UK Treasury removed Yasin al-Qadi from its list of persons designated as terrorists under its Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2001 (the "2001 Order"), but left Qadi on a second list of persons designated as terrorists under separate UK legislation, the Al Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 (the "2006 Order"), which contained different listing criteria.
According to his UK attorneys at the Carter-Ruck firm, "this delisting followed a comprehensive review by the UK Treasury of the case against Mr. Kadi, including a review of the materials which had been used to support Mr. Kadi's original designation, after which the UK Treasury concluded that "the case against (Mr. Kadi) no longer meets the test set out in ... the Terrorism Order."
January 2009: Kadi v Timothy Geithner et al.
On 16 January 2009, Qadi filed suit against officers of the U.S. Department of Treasury (OFAC) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ("Yassin Abdullah Kadi v. Timothy Geithner et al.", Civil Action No. 09-0108; and "Kadi v. Paulson et al.", a request for agency decision review assigned to Judge John D. Bates, Case 28-1331).
The lawsuit and request for agency review challenged Qadi’s designation as a terrorist and the asset freeze. Qadi raised “constitutional claims regarding due process, free speech, and protection from unreasonable seizure of assets.”
February 2009: Second challenge to EU listing and EU freeze.
In February 2009, Qadi filed a new lawsuit with the EU General Court (formerly the Court of First Instance), challenging the EU’s 28 November 2008 decision to renew his listing and assets freeze.
August 2009: UN clarifies reasons for listing Qadi.
On 13 August 2009, the United Nations Security Council Committee concerning Al-Qaida and associated individuals and entities (the "Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee") posted additional information and a narrative summary of their reasons for listing Yasin Abdullah Ezzeddine Qadi. The reasons included:
Based on these reasons, the U.N. Security Council resolved to continue listing Yasin al-Qadi as a suspected supporter of al-Qaeda terrorists and the United States Department of Treasury has continued to classify Qadi as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.
January 2010: UK Supreme Court delists Qadi.
On 27 January 2010, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (the highest appellate court for the UK) annulled the listing criteria of "the 2006 Order," the Al Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006. In 2010, in the case of "Her Majesty's Treasury v Ahmed" the UK Supreme Court struck down the operative part of the legislation, and ruled that it must be quashed as being "ultra vires", or beyond the powers of the government which were conferred under the UK's United Nations Act 1946, which allowed the UK to implement UN Security Council Resolutions.
Thus Qadi's removal from a second UK list of persons designated as terrorists "was done as the result of the finding of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom that any such designation (as was done in Mr. Kadi's case in contravention of his fundamental rights) was illegal."
September 2010: EU Court rules in Qadi’s favor, faults UN procedures.
On 30 September 2010, the EU General Court once again ruled in favor of Qadi, “noting that the UN procedure, despite improvements in the establishment of an Ombudsman Office to make recommendations on delisting requests, lacks fundamental due process protections, including sufficient notice of the charges and denying ‘most minimal access to the evidence against him.’ "
It said: “In essence the Security Council has still not deemed it appropriate to establish an independent and impartial body responsible for hearing . . . decisions taken by the Sanctions Committee.” (Paragraph 128).
According to Qadi's solicitors at the Carter-Ruck firm, the ruling had the effect of striking down the European asset-freezing regulation that was imposed on Qadi on 28 November 2008, after Qadi had won his appeal to the European Court of Justice.
8 September 2011: Sued by Lloyd's for 'funding 9/11 attacks'.
Qadi was among nine defendants sued by the Lloyd's of London insurance syndicate on 8 September 2011 in a "landmark legal case against Saudi Arabia, accusing the kingdom of indirectly funding al-Qa'ida and demanding the repayment of £136m [$215 million] it paid out to victims of the 9/11 attacks."
Formally titled "Underwriting Members of Lloyd's Syndicate 3500 v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia et al.", the civil suit was filed in Pittsburgh (the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania) by attorney Steven Cozen of Cozen O'Connor.
January 2014: Recep Erdogan Prime minister of Turkey, planning an escape route for qadi, and himself
“Absent the sponsorship of al Qaeda’s material sponsors and supporters, including the defendants named herein, al Qaeda would not have possessed the capacity to conceive, plan and execute the September 11th attacks,” according to the 154-page complaint.
Yasin al-Qadi is listed along with the following defendants:
March 2012: U.S. Judge Denies Qadi's motion to remove his name.
On 19 March 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed Qadi’s 2009 lawsuit against the officers of the U.S. Department of Treasury (OFAC). Judge John D. Bates brushed off Kadi's claim that OFAC "simply ignored" his explanation that Muwafaq was an organization engaged in charitable activities. Kadi had said the government believes Muwafaq is a front for bin Laden because USA Today reported that. "To the extent Kadi contends that newspaper articles cannot be relied upon by the government at all, that proposition is not well-grounded," Bates wrote. "As already stated, reliance on hearsay is plainly allowed. Furthermore, reliance on newspaper articles has been permitted to 'fill in evidentiary gaps when there is corroboration,' as well as to provide background information." Bates explained in his judgement.
Judge Bates cited that "the Court finds that this claim must be dismissed because (1) the bill of attainder clause does not apply to acts taken by a regulatory agency and (2) even if it did, the clause is not triggered here, because there was no action constituting "punishment." 
October 2012: UN Security Council removed Qadi's from terrorist list.
The U.N. Security Council created an independent ombudsman in 2009 to handle requests to get off the blacklist. The decision to delist al Qadi came following his request for removal, according to UN statement.
It stated that "after concluding its consideration of the delisting request submitted by this individual through the Ombudsperson established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1904 (2009), and after considering the Comprehensive Report of the Ombudsperson on this delisting request. Therefore, the assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo set out in paragraph 1 of Security Council resolution 1989 (2011) no longer apply to the following individual."

The Football New South Wales National Training Centre is run by the Football Federation Australia in conjunction with Football New South Wales, in Sydney, for Australian youth players. Up to 2013 the NSWIS ran this program for both men and women.
Program.
The men's program aims to prepare players for selection in the Australia U17 squad and Australian Institute of Sport program. 22 scholarships are awarded each year to athletes who are 15-17 years old that show the potential to represent Australia at U-17 level.
The women's program aims to improve the skills of nationally identified U20 and senior athletes.
There is also a Northern program for both men and women, which awards scholarships to athletes in the northern and more remote areas of New South Wales. This program is based on the same criteria as those of the central programs.
New South Wales Premier Youth League.
The men's program currently plays every year in the New South Wales Premier Youth League. The competition runs from February to August and fields U-20 teams from clubs who are competing in the corresponding senior men's competition, the New South Wales Premier League. Unlike its AIS counterpart, in the Victorian Premier League, the NSWIS team does not compete for points.

Peter Conder

Peter Conder, OBE (20 March 1919 – 8 October 1993) was a British ornithologist and conservationist known predominantly for his contribution as Director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
Early life.
Peter Conder was born in Streatham, London, the son of John Reynolds Conder, a shipbroker, and his wife Edna Francis, née Benson. He was educated at Cranleigh School, Surrey. His interest in ornithology arose at Cranleigh School where he was a member of the school ornithological society; he recalled sneaking from the school dormitory for early morning birdwatching expeditions. After secondary school, Conder went to Lausanne, Switzerland, to learn French and spent six weeks in Newfoundland on a British Schools Exploring Society expedition. In the spring of 1938, he started work at the pioneering advertising agency S H Benson (founded by Conder's grandfather).
Second World War.
As war approached, Conder joined the Territorial Army, and was commissioned into the 2nd London Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals. When the British Expeditionary Force was sent to France (with World War I weapons) in 1939, he was deployed with the Royal Ulster Rifles, the Coldstream and the Grenadier Guards near Lille. On 12 June 1940 he was captured by the Germans at Saint-Valery-en-Caux, France, with the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division. They were marched through France, Belgium, Holland and Germany to Laufen on the German-Austrian border. Conder later wrote, "When I was captured I lost thirty thousand words. Two years' work".
Prisoner of War.
From July 1940 to March 1941, Conder was incarcerated in Oflag VII-C, a prisoner-of-war-camp located in Laufen Castle on the banks of the Salzach river, Germany. In the spring of 1941, with the other younger officers he was moved to Stalag XXI-D in Poznań, Poland. In the move, he lost his suitcase containing writings of forty-five thousand words. A month later, Conder was moved to Stalag XX-A in the Toruń Fortress, Poland.
From Toruń, they were moved in June 1941 to Oflag V-B Biberach in southwest Germany. The camp was a modern German army barracks on the edge of the town set in a largely agricultural landscape with no trees or shrubs in the camp or close to it. Limited by the diversity of the local birds Conder spent the summer transcribing bird song.
Biberach was only from the Swiss border and this short distance was the stimulus for several escape attempts. The most successful tunnel started below the seats (above the excreta) of a multi-holed lavatory which was situated on the edge of the camp. Eventually the digging team got out of the camp and four made it to the Schaffhausen Gap in Switzerland.
In the autumn of 1941, he was moved to Oflag VI-B in Dössel outside Warburg. The camp was on a plain which rose slightly to the south and was above the town of Warburg or the village of Dössel, so that except for a hill to the south they could see almost 360 degrees. Five hundred yards up the hill there was a barn which was important to the escapers. Officers with special interests had a chance to meet others with similar interests who had been in different camps and that went for birdwatchers particularly. Amongst these were John Barrett, John Buxton and George Waterston. They met once a month in John Buxton's room to record the birds they had seen and had regular talks and discussions.
In July he was watching the Black Redstart and for most of the winter, Conder watched the feeding and roosting habits of the local flock of rooks and jackdaws and observed the migration of a variety of species including crows moving northeast to Russia. The birdwatching prisoners stationed themselves on a slag heap in the upper part of the camp where they had an overall view of the sky and horizon and could watch and record the birds that passed.
He was arrested by the German guards in early 1942 as suspicions arose over his motives, as he was in a position to acquire intelligence for prisoners digging tunnels. Conder escaped twice; once through a tunnel with fourteen others, but he was recaptured after an hour. The second time the prisoners were being marched to a new camp responding to news of the approaching Allied forces, the line of prisoners was getting longer and longer and he and a friend dived into woods when they went round a bend. They hid in a barn for a few days and eventually saw American tanks approaching and were picked up. Conder arrived back in England on 5 April 1945.
Conder started recording the behaviour of the European Goldfinch at this camp.
Post-war.
From 1947 Conder was warden at Skokholm Bird Observatory with the West Wales Field Society. Conder set high standards of research and observation, not only for birds, but for the whole range of island wildlife. He studied the Northern Wheatear.
RSPB years.
In 1954 he became Assistant Secretary of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), responsible for acquisition and management of nature reserves, research, prosecutions, monitoring oil pollution and pesticides, and the protection of rare birds including of the ospreys at Loch Garten, Strathspey.
Conder became the Director of the RSPB in 1963, Conder appointed specialist staff to deal with nature reserves, research, education, publications, film and financial administration. The membership rose from 20,000 to 200,000. Conservation achievements included the RSPB's contribution to the successful campaign to stop the use of organochlorine pesticides, ospreys had become established once more as a breeding species in Britain, the society's list of nature reserves was added to each year and the realisation of the significance of research to successful nature conservation, an applied science, was beginning to be taken seriously by government.
Conder retired in 1976.
Post-RSPB.
Conder spent the next decade serving on training programmes, conservation panels and advisory boards in Britain and abroad.
His bird records are archived in the Edward Grey Institutue of Ornithology, Oxford.

Odrzywół is a village in Przysucha County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Odrzywół. It lies in northern part of historic Lesser Poland, approximately north of Przysucha and south of Warsaw. The village has an approximate population of 1,300.
Odrzywół received town charter in 1418, due to the efforts of the Starosta of Radom, Dobrogost Czarny Odrzywolski (Nalecz coat of arms). King Wladyslaw Jagiello permitted Odrzywolski to turn the village of Wysokin into the town of Odrzywół because during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War, he had distinguished himself. Odrzywół remained a small town, which until the Partitions of Poland belonged to the Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1815 it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and was stripped of its town charter because of participation of residents in the January Uprising.
Currently Odrzywół is a road hub, with a junction of two roads (Konskie - Warsaw, and Lodz - Radom). The village has a late 18th century rectory, where in April 1809 Prince Jozef Poniatowski stayed. It also has a Neo-Gothic parish church, built in the early 20th century. In 1968, the church was visited by Cardinal Karol Wojtyla.

Koukouli () is a village of the Zagori region, in the municipal unit of Tymfi. It is situated at the southern end of the Vikos Gorge.
History.
Koukouli was founded during the 13th century. It was later included in the treaty signed between the villages of Zagori (there were 14 at the time) and the Ottomans at 1430. The villages of Zagori formed an autonomous federation for the next centuries. The privileges which were granted to the federation of Zagori and which are due, in the biggest part, to the influence of rich Zagorians over the Sublime Porte, were preserved until 1868. According to these privileges, Zagori was autonomous and self-governed under the surveillance of Vekili of Zagori. 
Many inhabitants, during the 18th century, became merchants, travelled abroad and made huge profits. The Plakidas family was one of those that made a fortune. Alexios Plakidas, a benefactor, donated huge amounts of money for the village and the Zagori region. 
Prior to the Second World War, Koukoulians used to migrate to Asia Minor and the U.S. Inside Greece, they mostly migrated to Macedonia.
Today, like the rest of Zagori, the village is a tourist destination, mainly in winter season. Buildings of traditional architecture such as the 2 schools and the historical Inn, serve as hotels for the tourists.

The village has an approximate population of 640, and used to be a town from the late 15th century to 1720. 
The history of Nieznamierowice dates back to the early years of the Polish statehood, when on a small local hill stood a gord, protected by the Drzewiczka river. In 1028, Nieznamierowice became a royal village, upon order of King Mieszko II. Soon afterwards, it became the seat of the Znamierowski family, which named it Znamierowice. It is not known when Znamierowice was granted Magdeburg rights town charter, but it probably happened in the 15th century. Its name was changed to Nieznamierowice, and the newly established town became the seat of a St. Andrew Roman Catholic parish, which was transferred here in 1521 from Galki. A wooden church was built here, then another one (1760-1782), which burned in 1922. Current church was built from limestone in 1923-1933. Nieznamierowice lost its town charter in 1720 and has since been a village.

Legs (comics)

__NOTOC__
Legs is a fictional character in the who appeared as a supporting character in various "Batman" related comics during the 80s and 90s. Co-created by writers John Wagner and Alan Grant, and artist Norm Breyfogle, he first appeared in "Detective Comics" #587 (June 1988).
Legs was created during "Detective Comics" debut of Wagner and Grant, co-writers established for their work on Judge Dredd comics for 2000 AD. However, due to poor sales of their comics within months of their debut, which left both men questioning the viability of their new jobs, Wagner soon left the project alone to Grant. Concerned that he would be fired if his editors learned the writing team had split, Grant alerted no one to the change, and decided to continue writing stories in the pattern of the first for the duration of his original contract. Now a regular writer for "Detective Comics" and other Batman-related titles during this time period, Grant made frequent use of the Legs as an ally for the anarchist themed character, Anarky. Legs is shown to be loyal to Anarky as a vigilante, who in turn employs Legs and other homeless men to act as diversions or spies against Batman. As such, the two characters appear together prominently in "", a trade paperback collection of comics written by Grant.
Legs is characterized as a homeless Vietnam veteran and resident of the streets of Gotham City. Holding strong views, the character is described as being prone to frustration, anger, and alcoholism, and frequently argues with other homeless men. Legs is ironically named for his missing limbs, which he is described as having lost due to an anti-personnel mine explosion in the Vietnam War in "Detective Comics" #608 (November 1989). Crippled and unable to afford a wheelchair, he is shown to move about in a wheeled tray.
The character has not appeared in published material since the departure of Alan Grant from DC Comics in 2000, and has fallen into obscurity.

Skrzynno, Masovian Voivodeship

Skrzynno is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Wieniawa, within Przysucha County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It lies approximately west of Wieniawa, east of Przysucha, and south of Warsaw. The village has a population of 300.
The village has a long and rich history. In the early days of the Kingdom of Poland, Skrzynno was an important center of northwestern Lesser Poland. First mention of Skrzynno comes from the year 1136. In a Bull of Pope Innocent II, a settlement called Scrin is presented. By 1234, Skrzynno already was a local administrative center (districtus Scrin), and first mention of its parish church comes from 1280. In that year, Prince Przemysl II made a transaction with Bishop of Poznan, giving him villages in Greater Poland, in exchange for Skrzynno, together with the church (villa forensem sitam in terra Sandomiriensi cum ecclesia). A few years later, Przemysl II sold Skrzynno to Pomeranian Prince Mestwin II. In the early 14th century, Skrzynno was handed over to Wladyslaw Lokietek. 
The town was divided into two separate municipalities - Skrzynsko (Antiqua Skrzin) and Skrzynno (Skrzin). Furthermore, there was a settlement called Nova Skrzin. It is not known when Skrzynno received its town charter (Sroda Slaska rights), it probably took place before the year 1308. During the reign of Kazimierz Wielki, Skrzynno was a royal town. In the second half of the 14th century, it became property of Cistercian Abbey from Sulejow (see Sulejow Abbey). It has not been established who was the founder of the Skrzynno parish church. It could have been Piotr Wlostowic, who lived in the late 11th and early 12th century. Current church was built in 1626-38. After the destruction in the Great Northern War, the church was remodelled several times. 
Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights Ulrich von Jungingen was killed by the knight Mszczuj from Skrzynno in the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) in 1410.

Wieniawa is a village in Przysucha County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland (historic Lesser Poland). It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Wieniawa. It lies approximately east of Przysucha and south of Warsaw.
The history of the village dates back to the late Middle Ages, and its original name was Klodno. The Roman Catholic parish at Klodno was founded in 1365, but the history of the first church here dates back to 1264. In the second half of the 15th century, the village was purchased by the Wieniawita noble family, which changed its name to Wieniawa. 
The village is famous for its parish church, which was founded in the year 1511 by father Stanislaw Mlodecki, in the location of the 13th century wooden church. The oldest part of the church is a late Gothic presbitery, together with St. Stanislaus chapel. The nave with two side altars were built in 1703, and the whole complex was renovated in 1909-12. 
The most interesting element in the church is its main altar, known as the Wieniawa Polyptych, which comes from the year 1544, and is in Renaissance style. The names of creators of the main altar are not known, and the Wieniawa Polyptych is regarded as one of the finest examples of Renaissance art in the Radom Land. It consists of three parts, illustrating the life and death of Saint Stanislaus of Szczepanow, Bishop and Martyr.

Budgeted cost of work performed

Budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP), or "earned value" (EV), in project management is the budgeted cost of work that has actually been performed in carrying out a scheduled task during a specific time period. NASA's definition of the BCWP is the sum of the budgets for completed work packages and completed portions of open work packages, plus the applicable portion of the budgets for level of effort and apportioned effort. BCWP is an Earned value management term and it is different from:

Dimp Animator

Dimp Animator is an upcoming animation program for Mac OS X. The concept of the program is based on Pivot Stickfigure Animator. The animation consists of one or more stick figures composed from so called 'bones' which have handles to rotate them. Combined with tweening over time, this allows the user to animate the figures. On December 31, 2008, a "preview" of Dimp Animator was released. On December 28, 2008 the forum "Dimpleton" was launched for discussion of the program.
The main difference between Dimp and other stick figure applications like Pivot is that it primarily uses tweening instead of frames, making it easier to create smooth animations.

It acts as a partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptors, meaning that it causes the opposite effects to most benzodiazepine drugs, and instead acts as an anxiogenic and convulsant. It is used in veterinary medicine to reverse the effects of benzodiazepine sedative drugs in order to rapidly re-awaken anaethetised animals.

Anzac Avenue

Anzac Avenue is a heritage-listed major arterial road north of Brisbane, Queensland. It runs 18 km from Petrie to Redcliffe, with most of the route signed as state route 71. The route was formerly the main route to the Redcliffe peninsula, until the Houghton Highway bridge was built.
The road provides the quickest access to the Peninsula Fair Shopping Centre, as well as being the main access road for the Redcliffe Hospital.
Route.
Description.
The current route begins in Petrie, at a roundabout intersection with state route 58 at Gympie Road and Dayboro Road. It proceeds north, then north-east, through Kallangur, before crossing the Bruce Highway near North Lakes. After passing the Westfield North Lakes shopping centre, it proceeds north-east again through semi-rural areas near Mango Hill, before crossing Hays Inlet at Saltwater Creek, and intersecting with state route 26 at Deception Bay Road. Signed as both routes 71 and 26, it then turns eastward and proceeds through the suburbs of Rothwell and Kippa-Ring, reverting to route 71 only at an intersection with Elizabeth Avenue, before proceeding to Redcliffe, crossing state route 27 at Oxley Avenue, and terminating at a roundabout with Redcliffe Parade on the waterfront.
Major intersections.
The entire road is in the Moreton Bay Region local government area.
History.
Early history.
The first road along the route was an Aboriginal track used to access Kippa Ring, then the site of a prominent bora ring. By the 1860s, a road had been constructed from Bald Hills to Redcliffe, using part of the route of the current Anzac Avenue, but this road was poorly constructed and fell into disuse within a couple of years. Thomas Petrie, in the 1870s, marked another track from Hays Inlet to Redcliffe, this route was later surveyed and became known as "Brisbane Road", and became the primary way of accessing the Redcliffe Peninsula by road, although the trip was still difficult and all but impossible during inclement weather.
Memorial avenue.
After the First World War, memorials to fallen servicemen were erected across Queensland and often became prominent features in their communities. Utilitarian monuments, such as halls, hospitals, and roads became common, not just to commemorate war dead, but also to provide essential services to growing communities and provide work for returned soldiers. Anzac Avenue was one such project, built along a route first surveyed in the 1860s, designed to provide a reliable link to Redcliffe, which at the time was still largely isolated and could only be reached easily by boat, and not by car, which was rapidly becoming the transport method of choice for Queenslanders.
In 1922, Thomas Rothwell, a successful Brisbane businessman, and the RACQ, presented a plan to John Coyne, the Queensland Lands Minister, for the construction of a road between Petrie and Redcliffe. Coyne agreed to provide funding for the construction materials used on the road, provided that Rothwell and the RACQ could provide £20,000 for the payment of the returned soldiers who would build the road. To this end, Rothwell formed the Anzac Avenue Memorial Committee to secure the funds, and was elected as its chairman. Fundraising proceeded steadily, with a large billboard being erected on Queen Street in Brisbane, featuring a car that moved forward a step for every £1000 raised. The committee received a significant boost when a new federal government funding arrangement contributed £12,000 towards the effort. Within six months of beginning fundraising, the full amount had been raised and construction was ready to begin.
Construction activity proceeded rapidly; in December 1922 there were twenty-five returned servicemen employed constructing the road, by March of the following year, this number had increased to fifty. Work included not just sealing the road, using a mixture of tar and trachyte sourced from a quarry at Beerburrum, but also constructing culverts to cross over Hays Inlet and Saltwater Creek, and associated earthworks to provide a stable base for the roadway in the often low-lying areas that the route passed through. The road was first opened to traffic in 1925 at a ceremony, at which Acting Premier William Forgan Smith, Redcliffe mayor J. B. Dunn and Pine Rivers Shire Chairman W. Bradley spoke. The new road was the longest memorial avenue in Queensland.
Shortly after the road was opened, Rothwell wrote to local newspapers to draw attention to the tree planting work that would also be required before the plan came to fruition. As early as 1922, Rothwell and the assistant director of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, had been inspecting the route to come up with a suitable scheme for planting trees. The first planting, of two cocos palms, took place in February 1925. By mid-1927, 1000 trees had been planted, and by November 1929 over 2000 trees had been established.
Recent history.
Despite the construction of the Hornibrook Bridge in 1935 providing an alternative route by car to the Redcliffe peninsula, traffic volumes along Anzac Avenue steadily increased as the years went by, necessitating duplication of some sections of the road in the 1980s and the 1990s. This widening, although required in order to manage traffic congestion, resulted in the need to remove or relocate some of the tree plantings along the route, a move that was not without controversy at the time.
Although originally primarily a rural route, increasing population growth in the area, most notably the development of entirely new suburbs such as Rothwell and North Lakes, has meant that much of the route has taken on a suburban character, providing everyday access to residents, rather than being a tourist drive, as originally planned. The road was inducted onto the Queensland Heritage Register in 2009.
Plantings.
A number of different types of tree were selected by the Anzac Avenue Memorial Committee to be placed along the roadside. These included:

Glastonbudget

Glastonbudget is an annual music festival held in Leicestershire. The festival has been held since 2005 at Turnpost Farm, Wymeswold.
Initially started as a festival for tribute bands it has expanded in recent years to include a showcase for new acts as well as the main tribute stage. Interest in the festival and those attending has increased year on year with the 2012 festival seeing almost 12,000 festival goers in attendance.
Since 2006, the festival has invited special guests to perform. These have included Chas and Dave (2006), The Neville Staples Specials (2007), Bad Manners (2008) and Chesney Hawkes (2009), Ex Simple Minds (2010), Doctor and The Medics (2011) and Showaddywaddy, The Sweet, and the welcome return of Chesney Hawkes in 2012.
The 2013 Glastonbudget event will see performances from Uk Tributes and Unsigned acts, with special guest performances from 80's superstars Howard Jones and ABC.
Organisation.
The event is organised annually by a small team including Nick Tanner and Murray Stewart, who take pride in the fact that they have never been to a mainstream music festival. The event is run and managed from a small base at The Harrow Inn, Thurmaston.
Charity Links.
In 2010 Glastonbudget announced that they would be supporting Leicestershire-based charity LOROS www.loros.com LOROS (the Leicestershire and Rutland Organisation for the Relief of Suffering) is a local charity providing care and support within Leicestershire and Rutland.
Controversy.
In late 2008 a dispute arose between people involved in organizing the festival which eventually ended with the trade mark and glastonbudget.co.uk domain being transferred to Mockstar limited. During the dispute, two websites existed with contradictory claims to who was running the festival.

Charles Henry Sloane Cadogan, 2nd Earl Cadogan (29 November 1749 – 23 December 1832) was a British nobleman, styled Viscount Chelsea from 1800 to 1807.
The eldest child of Charles Cadogan, 3rd Baron Cadogan and Frances Bromley, he was baptised on 13 December 1749 at St George's, Hanover Square. He became 2nd Earl Cadogan on the death of his father in 1807.
He served briefly in the British Army in his youth. By the time he had inherited, he had already become a lunatic. He died unmarried in Enfield and so his title passed to his half-brother George Cadogan, 3rd Earl Cadogan. He was buried at Chelsea on 3 January 1833 and his will was probated in July that year.

HMS Glorieux

The French ship "Glorieux" was a second rate 74 gun ship in the French Navy. Built by Clairin Deslauriers at Rochefort and launched on 10 August 1756, she was rebuilt in 1777.
French service.
On 30 August 1781, she was with the French fleet under Admiral de Grasse. According to French sources, the British sloop and the frigate were on picket duty in the Chesapeake when they encountered French. "Guadeloupe" escaped up the York River to York Town, where she would later be scuttled. The English court martial records report that "Loyalist" was returning to the British fleet off the Jersey coast when she encountered the main French fleet. The French frigate "Aigrette", with the 74-gun "Glorieux" in sight, was able to overtake "Loyalist". The French took her into service as "Loyaliste" in September, but then gave her to the Americans in November 1781.
The British captured "Glorieux" at the Battle of the Saintes on 10 April 1782 and commissioned her into the Royal Navy as HMS "Glorieux" or HMS "Glorious" the following day. She was rated as a third rate.
Fate.
She sailed with the fleet for England on 25 July 1782 but was lost later that year in a hurricane storm off Newfoundland on 16–17 September, along with the other captured French prize ships "Ville de Paris", "Hector" and "Caton". "Glorieux" was lost with all hands, including her captain, Thomas Cadogan, son of Charles Cadogan, 3rd Baron Cadogan. This disaster to the fleet of Admiral Graves also saw the loss of HMS "Ramillies", HMS "Centaur", the storeships "Dutton" and "British Queen", and other merchantmen from a convoy of 94 ships, with a total of over 3,500 men lost.
Other.
Heller SA has created a 1:150 scale model of "Le Glorieux" in its French guise.

Russellville Historic District

The Russellville Historic District in Russellville, Kentucky, is located in south central Kentucky. Among Kentuckian municipalities in its size range it has the largest historic district, comprising fifty separate city blocks. Another distinction is that the district is centered around the commercial corridor, instead of the county courthouse, unlike most county seats in Kentucky.
Much of the district is formed of buildings for the late 18th to 19th centuries, with the more prominent ones built between 1800 and 1830, including the homes of four Kentucky governors. Most of the modern structures in the district were designed so as to mesh in with the older buildings. The wealthier citizens of the district historically lived in the southwestern corner. Northwest of the district's cemetery is where Irish immigrants who worked on the local railroads lived. The district also features several excellent structures of Victorian architecture, whose atypical-for-Kentucky partial mansard roofs indicate a construction date after the Civil War.
There is significant history in the district. It was here in the William Forst House that the Confederate government of Kentucky was formed, commemorated by the Confederate Monument in Russellville. It is also the site of the first documented bank robbery by Jesse James, which occurred in 1868, of the Nimrod Long Banking Company, totalling $9,000. Future United States President Andrew Jackson fought a duel in the district.
Russellville was known as a "rogue's harbor", as many of its early settlers moved there due to being wanted by the law in other areas, or simply needed a fresh start. The first house in the district was built in 1790, but it no longer stands.

Better Can't Make Your Life Better

"Better Can't Make Your Life Better" is a 1996 album by the American indie rock band, Lilys. 
Recording.
The album was recorded for the British label Ché and picked up by Elektra Records subsidiary Primary for release in the US. The album originally had a budget of $8,000, but this needed to be more than doubled to $17,000, with the projected studio time of one month extended to two. Battles with the label over finance led to several compromises; Lilys leader Kurt Heasley had originally planned the album to sound "like Badfinger backed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra", and a big band had been planned but was replaced by xylophone and trumpet players, with samples of clarinet and bassoon added later, and by the end of the recordings Heasley claimed to have been a nervous wreck and 50 pounds underweight from eating only garlic.
Critical reception.
Mark Jenkins of the "Washington Post" described the album as "remarkably seamless" and "assembled from shards of mid-'60s rock". Jason Ankeny, writing for "Allmusic" described the album's sound as "the Lilys hop into the time machine and travel back to the mid-'60s, immersing themselves in the style of the British Invasion." Neil Gladstone, writing for "CMJ New Music Monthly" identified The Kinks, The Monkees and The Zombies as influences on the album. Robert Hickey, writing for PopMatters called it "a great CD, sounding like something the Kinks would have made had Ray Davies embraced psychedelia instead of taking up charter membership in the Village Green Preservation Society." Tom Cox of "The Guardian" gave the album four stars, calling it "an album of scrambled, dreamstate intellect and endless hooks...like The Byrds getting high and beating up The Monkees on fast forward."
Singles.
"Returns Every Morning" was the first single taken from the album, released in April 1996. "A Nanny In Manhattan" was first released as a single in November 1996 on 7-inch vinyl only. It was used in a Roman Coppola-directed ad for Levi's prompting its re-release (with new sleeve art and B-sides) in February 1998 and it became a hit on the UK Singles Chart, reaching #16, the band's only major hit single.

Junior duck stamp

The Federal Junior Duck Stamp is an American art competition sponsored by the United States government for students to draw, or paint a duck realistically. 
The program began in 1989 with a grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) and was first recognized by the United States Congress in 1994 when the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program Act was enacted. 
Entries in the contest may be paintings or drawings. The program is designed to be "a dynamic arts curriculum that teaches wetlands and waterfowl conservation to students from kindergarten through high school". The best of show winner form each state participates in a national tour of entries and is forwarded to the national competition.
There is also a Conservation Message contest, where contestants write their own conservation messages about wildlife. 
Each year, Junior Duck Stamp State Coordinators in all 50 U.S. states, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgins Islands help to bring the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program to more than 28,000 students. To honor the most dedicated coordinators, the Junior Duck Stamp Program developed the Green Ribbon Award for State Coordinator of the Year. We are pleased to recognize the 2011 State Coordinator of the Year, Marilyn Gamette of California. Gamette has been committed to the JDS program since its inception in 1989, working to expand the program in California and helping to break state and national records with 3,126 pieces of art submitted in 2011. Throughout her career and into her retirement from the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex, Gamette has inspired children and adults with her dedication and educational efforts.

Kamka Kura

Kamka Kura (KK), Youth and Livelihood based Radio Program produced by Equal Access Nepal, is the radio program that is meant for the youth who are seeking for better opportunity and for good and secure future. With a tagline of Exploring Livelihoods, Kamka Kura is a distant learning job skills training radio series designed with the objective to help youth of Nepal, especially for those young people who are most disadvantaged regarding education and opportunities, to understand how to identify, prepare for, participate in and benefit from locally available skills training programs and more importantly, how to seize opportunities without need of a new training. 
Kamka Kura disseminates information regarding livelihood issues (i.e. Agriculture, technical vocational education and skills, Livestock, Education) through the means of drama, chat, interview, success stories, feature, reports, letters etc. It also creates linkages with local services providers.
KK began broadcasting on May 16, 2007 and broadcast its final episode on September 1, 2010 through Radio Nepal and in first week of September through other FM stations. It was broadcast over 36 local radio stations nationwide, both in urban and rural areas including State radio, Radio Nepal.
From October 2009 - March 2010, with support from Internews Europe, Kamka Kura produced and broadcast programs on themes of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) and Micro-finance. The program aimed to encourage information seeking behavior among micro finance/small and medium enterprises and build awareness and capacity among micro finance institutions to simply critical business information.
From June - August 2010, Kamka Kura incorporated issues related to Skills for Employability with support from British Council. Issues like importance of vocational skills, information on some vocational and technical areas, importance of skill testing and other skills like entrepreneurship, communication skills, presentation skills etc. were included along with the "Learning English" section which aimed to teach English for work to its listeners.
Till date, more than 20 listeners' clubs of Kamka Kura have been formed spontaneously by its listeners. It also receives around 200 letters and emails every month on different livelihood issues.
History.
Saathi Sanga Manka Kura (SSMK) is popular youth radio show on life skills and HIV & AIDS. Based on Knowledge, Attitude, Practice and Skills (KAPS) study and other frequent qualitative studies, UNICEF developed an innovative radio program in Nepali: “Saathi Sanga Man Ka Kura ( SSMK ) ” or “Chatting with my best friend” or in short SSMK in 2001. It is the centerpiece of Unicef's communication initiative for young people which is the first radio program produced by the young people and for the young people in Nepal. It is designed to be interactive with listeners as a peer who speaks their mind without moral judgment. The program’s popularity has often been assessed by its listeners through feedback and letters in terms of its non-judgmental, confidential and open platform nature, where anyone can open their heart out on issues deeply related to them.
SSMK has won many national and international prestigious awards on Information communication technology or ICTs including Global Junior Challenge Award, International Children Broadcasting Day Award and many more. 
SSMK receives around 1400 letters and 200 emails every month on various issues that matters to young people of Nepal. Among most of the letters, concerns on livelihood and employment opportunities are always received in high number. Nepal has unemployment rate of over 42% and its per capita income is barely $350. So most of youths either migrate to foreign countries or city areas in search of opportunities and jobs.
According to many studies and assessments, lack of opportunities and unemployment are the major problem being faced by Nepalese youth. Because of lack of opportunities, young people are compelled to migrate to urban areas or foreign countries. Government estimates that around 600 young people leave for abroad every day in search of work and opportunities. This data excludes the number of young people who leave without any documentation through India. Because of lack of opportunities, young people not only migrate for opportunities but also are facing other problems like frustration resulting various social problems. 
In the view of high rates of youth migrating to urban areas or to foreign countries because of lack of opportunities and unemployment in Nepal, SSMK started its spin off radio programme on livelihood called Kamka Kura on May 2007.

Miss World 1970

Miss World 1970, the 20th edition of the Miss World pageant, was held on November 20, 1970 at Royal Albert Hall, London, United Kingdom. 58 contestants competed for the Miss World. Jennifer Hosten from Grenada won the crown of Miss World 1970. She was crowned by Miss World 1969, Eva Rueber-Staier of Austria. However the event was marked by controversy in the days beforehand, during the contest itself and afterwards.
Protests and controversy.
There was controversy before the contest began because the organisers had allowed two entries from South Africa, one black, one white. On the evening of the contest, a bomb exploded under a BBC outside broadcast van in an unsuccessful attempt by the Angry Brigade to prevent the contest being televised. There were no injuries. The audience then had to enter the hall past noisy demonstrators who were penned behind barricades. 
During the evening there were protests by Women's Liberation activists. They held up placards, shouted, blew whistles, and threw smoke bombs, stink bombs, ink bombs and leaflets onto the stage. The comedian, Bob Hope, was also heckled during the proceedings. 
Even greater controversy then followed after the result was announced. Jennifer Hosten won and the black contestant from South Africa was placed second. The BBC and newspapers received numerous protests about the result and accusations of racism were made by all sides. Four of the nine judges had given first-place votes to Miss Sweden, while Miss Grenada received only two firsts, yet the Swedish entrant finished fourth. Furthermore the Prime Minister of Grenada, Sir Eric Gairy, was on the judging panel. Inevitably there were many accusations that the contest had been rigged. Some of the audience gathered in the street outside Royal Albert Hall after the contest and chanted "Swe-den, Swe-den". Four days later the organising director, Julia Morley, resigned because of the intense pressure from the newspapers. Years later Miss Sweden, Maj Christel Johansson, was reported as saying that she had been cheated out of the title. (Eric Gairy was overthrown as Prime Minister of Grenada on March 13, 1979 while he was at the UN by the New Jewel Movement led by Maurice Bishop, whose father had been murdered by Gairy's men.
Julia Morley's husband, Eric Morley, was the chairman of the company (Mecca) that owned the Miss World franchise. To disprove the accusations, Eric Morley put the judging panel's ballot cards on view and described the complex "majority vote system". These cards showed that Jennifer Hosten had more place markings in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th positions over Miss Sweden and the other five finalists. Julia Morley then resumed her job. However many still felt Sir Eric Gairy on the judging panel had influenced the other judges to give Jennifer token placings.

Surviving Sid

Surviving Sid is a 2008 computer-animated short film from Blue Sky Studios, starring Sid the Sloth of "Ice Age" and a cameo appearance by Scrat. It is the third in the series of "Ice Age" short films, the other two being "Gone Nutty" and "No Time for Nuts". Unlike the first two "Ice Age" short films, "Surviving Sid" focuses on Sid and a small group of camping children. Directed by Galen Tan Chu and Karen Disher, the short premiered on December 9, 2008, on the "Horton Hears a Who!" DVD and Blu-ray.
Plot.
Sid, the Sloth, takes a school of children out on a camping trip from home, only to find that in typical Sid style, he is not a very good guide and the children he takes with him don't have a very good time. Scrat makes a small cameo appearance in the short, he has swallowed his nut and is struggling to keep it down, in true Scrat style he coughs it up and it is stolen from him. The camping trip leaves some of the children somewhat traumatized. Sid tries to pick a flower, but somehow this has led to a tree falling, which then hits a rock, which causes a chain reaction and hits a series of larger rocks, until eventually hitting a large iceberg. The iceberg then carves out a u-shaped valley, which Sid later names the Grand Canyon. Afterwards the kids get so annoyed with Sid that it ends with them tying him up. At the end of the short movie (20,000 years later in the present day) it shows a father and son beaver looking over the Grand Canyon with the son asking who made it. The father replies "Nature or a being with infinite wisdom."
Release.
The short film was released with the "Horton Hears a Who!" Blu-ray and DVD, which was released in the United Kingdom on October 20, 2008, and in the United States on December 9, 2008.
As of July 2009, it is also available as a free "Video Podcast" in the USA iTunes Store, and on the PlayStation Network.

Elisabeth Bas

Elisabeth Bas (1571, in Kampen – 2 August 1649, in Amsterdam) was a figure in the Dutch Republic. She was the wife of Jochem Hendrickszoon Swartenhont. 
Swartenhont was a captain in the navy of the Dutch Republic and a military hero. Jochem Swartenhont was painted, wearing his military decorations by Nicolaes Eliasz. Pickenoy (1588-1655) - Pickenoy also painted Joachem's daughter Maria. During the Twelve Years' Truce (1609-1621) Jochem was out of work and set up a tavern in Amsterdam named after the Prince of Orange. It was on the corner of the Nes and the Pieter Jacobszstraat and was patronised by politicians, artists and writers. After Jochem's death Elisabeth sold it, becoming rich (she left 28,000 guilders on her death). 
Jochem died in 1627, leaving his wife and four children. Three of these children died before their mother. The eldest daughter, Maria, had had three children and so these were adopted by Elisabeth on Maria's death - one of them, Maria Rey, later commissioned a portrait of Elisabeth from Ferdinand Bol. It is now in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, where it is known as "Elisabeth Bas" and attributed to Ferdinand Bol (1616 - 1680), though the identity of the sitter is held to be in doubt by the Rijksmuseum. Until 1911 it was thought to be by Rembrandt, but that year the Rembrandt expert Abraham Bredius re-attributed it to Bol. Such a re-attribution was hotly contested by the collector and art historian Cornelis Hofstede de Groot (1836-1930), but is now accepted. A brand of cigars was named after this painting in the 20th century, produced at a factory at Boxtel and using the painting as a logo, and their bands and the boxes for cigars of this brand are still collectors' items.

Forsa Institute

The forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis (), forsa for short, is one of the leading market research and opinion polling companies in Germany. It was founded in 1984 by Manfred Güllner in Cologne and is now headquartered in Berlin with a branch in Dortmund; it formerly also had an office in Riga, Latvia.
In addition to opinion research, forsa conducts surveys regarding community and other public services, basic industry, manufacturing, investments broadly construed, traffic and transport, financial services and print, television and other media.
Forsa has approximately 60 permanent employees, and hires further interviewers as part-time independent contractors from Monitel GmbH. In contrast GfK, Germany's largest market research firm, has approximately 1,600 permanent employees in Germany alone.
Methods.
Telephone polling.
Forsa currently uses computer-assisted telephone interviewing, telephoning a representative sample of at least 1,000 persons per day between 4.30 and 9.00 pm., enabling them to reach most employed people. Those 14 and older are permitted to voluntarily answer questions, which primarily concern social research, political and election research, and media, marketing and online consumer research. The phone numbers are randomly selected and all data anonymised and evaluated only for statistical purposes. For statistical reasons, only the household member who last had a birthday is interviewed. The intention is to form a picture of the "typical German" which includes all ages and both sexes in equal proportions.
To maintain objectivity, the sponsors of a questionnaire are not named until interviews are completed. However, sponsoring firms and institutions and fields of interest can be gleaned from forsa's publications and those of industry groups such as the "Berufsverband Deutscher Markt- und Sozialforscher" and the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research. It is clear that opinion research alone no longer suffices to fund larger institutions.
Further survey methods.
Forsa also uses other interviewing and surveying methods, in particular computer-assisted personal interviewing for business to business surveys.
Online surveys.
For online research, forsa uses its own intranet of approximately 10,000 households throughout Germany, forsa.omninet, who are recruited offline and respond to surveys either online or via a television set-top box.
Controversies.
Accusations of political bias.
Both forsa and its head, Manfred Güllner, have been accused of bias towards the SPD in connection with pre-election polls, most recently before the 2005 election in North Rhine-Westphalia. Forsa was successful in obtaining an injunction against accusations from the CDU on this issue, but their surveys did show in part a greater agreement with SPD positions than those of other polling firms. Forsa have themselves stated that they received 40,000 € in fees in connection with the national election in 2002 and in connection with the state election in 2005. In an interview on 6 September 2002, Hans Mathias Kepplinger, a professor of public relations at the University of Mainz, named three other firms as relatively likely to be free of party bias, but not forsa, although one of the three he named, the Institut für Demoskopie Allensbach, which has collaborated with the University of Mainz, cannot be said to be altogether free of ties to the CDU.
After the national elections in 2005, forsa's closeness to the SPD lessened appreciably and indeed reversed: in 2007 and still more in the first quarter of 2008, forsa reported poll results for the SPD an average of approximately 5% lower than those of other polling firms. Accusations have therefore been levelled at forsa of slanting results against the SPD and its "reformist course" after former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, a longtime friend of Manfred Güllner, stood down in favour of the CDU's Angela Merkel.
One example was a study in summer 2008 on the basis of which forsa reported that 36% of SPD members had considered leaving the party. Then-party chief Kurt Beck criticised Güllner severely and stated that he would not comment on forsa surveys.
Accusations of data manipulation.
In 2003 forsa was accused of data manipulation in a poll on tuition fees for higher education commissioned by the Centre for College Development ("Centrum für Hochschulentwicklung") co-founded by the Bertelsmann Foundation. According to the statement of findings, the majority of students (59%) and of the population (67%) stated in November 2003 that they would accept tuition fees if they directly benefitted the educational institutions and could be financed through loans. The Centre for College Development announced these results in a press release in December 2003 and they were reported in the press. But later that month, a spokesperson for the Centre indirectly admitted that respondents were only given the option of deciding between three models of tuition fees, and not of rejecting them entirely.
In 2007 forsa was accused on the political website NachDenkSeiten of becoming involved through manipulation of a survey in a campaign by the organization "Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft" (Initiative for a New Social Market Economy) for the introduction of private health insurance.
Forsa was the market research firm involved in the 2009 public relations scandal concerning Deutsche Bahn. Surveys with leading questions which produced results showing disapproval of the 2007 train drivers' strike and approval of privatisation of the railway were secretly funded by Deutsche Bahn.

Bury Ditches

Bury Ditches is a British Iron Age hill fort between Clun and Bishop's Castle in the Shropshire Hills of central England.
Site.
The site in encompassed by Forestry Commission pine plantations but storms in the 1970s and 1980s led to the removal of woodland from the hill fort site on the crown of the hill, from which today the views are open in all directions.
There is a car park within an easy uphill walk of the summit.
Description.
Bury Ditches is often rated as a spectacular example of a surviving hill fort as it forms a neat oval or elliptical shape and is situated on the crown of a hill called Sunnyhill and comprises up to four multi-vallate ditches and rampart banks as part of its defensive earthworks and two well preserved entrance ways.
From the summit views are clear to the Long Mynd, Corndon Hill and the Shropshire Hills.
Waymarked walks cross the site and pass through the woodlands below. The Shropshire Way and Jack Mytton Way pass below the site and Wild Edric's Way crosses adjacent to it also.

Jochem Hendrickszoon Swartenhont

Jochem Hendricksz Swartenhont (1566, Amsterdam – 5 June, 1627) was a Dutch naval officer in the navy of the Dutch Republic from the 17th century. 
Swartenhondt started his career on the merchant fleet, becoming a cabin boy at age eleven. He attained the rank of first mate. Later he joined the army to fight against the Dunkirkers but in 1587 he was captured and forced to serve on the Habsburg galleys in Flanders; he managed to escape however and brought with him important intelligence about the Spanish Armada of 1588.
In 1596 he became a lieutenant with the Amsterdam admiralty; in 1597 a captain.
In 1599 he distinguished himself while serving as captain of a ship in a fleet under Vice-Admiral Pieter van der Does during an expedition to Gran Canaria. In 1602 he became a Vice-Admiral with the Amsterdam Admiralty and served under Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer-Duivenvoorde on an expedition to the Spanish coast. From 1603 to 1605 he served as a temporary Vice-Admiral under Paulus van Caerden during an expedition to the West Indies and Brazil. In 1605 he ended his service, becoming an inn-keeper, but in 1608 again was readmitted as a temporary Vice-Admiral.
He was painted, wearing his military decorations, by Nicolaes Eliasz Pickenoy (1588–1655), who also painted Jochem's daughter Maria.
At the start of the Twelve Years' Truce in 1609 he again retired from service. From 1609 to 1620 he and his wife, Elisabeth Jacobs Bas (1571-1649), would keep the "Prins van Oranje" ("Prince of Orange") tavern in Amsterdam, a popular watering hole of many politicians, artists, and writers. After Jochem's death his widow Elisabeth Bas sold it, becoming rich (she left 28,000 guilders on her death). Ferdinand Bol made a well-known painting of Elisabeth in 1640, many years after Joachim's death.
In 1620, when the truce was about to end, at his own request Jochem returned to the fleet as a Vice-Admiral; in 1621 he became Lieutenant-Admiral of Holland and West-Friesland and he commanded a large convoy to the Mediterranean and successfully defended it against an attack by a Spanish squadron. In 1622 he acted as temporary Lieutenant-Admiral; after that year he left the naval service for good.

Since 1947, a university in this region has been a long cherished dream. A popular demand for a kind of university which can reach out to a large number of students desiring higher education in this vast region has always been intensely felt but has never been fulfilled. In 2001, the then Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina laid the foundations of Rangpur University of Science and Technology. However, later on the establishment was cancelled. It was not until August 2007 when Fakhruddin Ahmed, Chief Advisor of the Caretaker Government, agreed in principle to establish a full fledged university in Rangpur. Finally, Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmad, in a historic cabinet meeting held in Rangpur on February 2, 2008, took the decision to establish a University in Rangpur. The Rangpur University Ordinance was approved by the cabinet on June 15, 2008. M. Lutfar Rahman was appointed the first Vice Chancellor on 20 October 2008.

Sea of Poppies

Sea of Poppies (2008) is a novel by Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2008. It is the first volume of what will be the Ibis trilogy. The second volume is "River of Smoke".
The main characters include Deeti, an ordinary village woman, a mulatto American sailor named Zachary Reid, an Indian rajah / zamindar called Neel Rattan Halder, and Benjamin Burnham, an evangelist opium trader.
The story is set prior to the Opium Wars, on the banks of the holy river Ganges and in Calcutta. The author compares the Ganges to the Nile, the lifeline of the Egyptian civilization, attributing the provenance and growth of these civilizations to these selfless, ever-flowing bodies. He portrays the characters as poppy seeds emanating in large numbers from the field to form a sea, where every single seed is uncertain about its future.
Synopsis.
The story begins with Deeti, a simple, pious lady, caring mother and an efficient housewife. Married to Hukam Singh, a crippled worker in the Ghazipur Opium Factory, the unfortunate Deeti figures out that on her wedding night, she was drugged with opium by her mother-in-law, so that her brother-in-law could rape her and consummate the marriage in place of her infertile husband. This brother-in-law is the real father of Deeti's daughter Kabutri. When her husband dies, Deeti sends Kabutri to stay with relatives. Deeti looks almost certain to meet her doom when she is forced to consider sati ritual (immolation on her husband's funeral pyre) as the only option in the face of threats of more rapes by the brother-in-law, but then Kalua, the untouchable caste ox man from the neighbouring village, comes to her rescue. The couple flee and unite. This is not acceptable to the high caste villagers. In order to escape Deeti's in-laws, she and Kalua become indentured servants on the Ibis.
Zachary Reid, an American sailor born to a slave mother and a white father, receives a lot of attention. He has been on the Ibis since the schooner started her arduous journey, and hopes to die with it. He maintains that in his lifetime he has never seen a more admirable article than the Ibis and it is no less than a mother to him, supporting him in his dark hours and rejoicing with him in his happiness. With the support of the head of the lascars, Serang Ali, he becomes the second in command of the ship, when it was refitted to carry indentured labour to the island of Mareech or Mauritius instead of the tradable opium.
Neel Rattan Halder, a wealthy rajah whose dynasty has been ruling the zemindary of Rakshali for centuries, is confronted by Mr. Burnham with the need to sell off his estates in order to pay for the debt he had incurred when trading opium with China at the height of the opium trade. But now that the opium trade has come to a standstill, as a result of the resistance shown by the Chinese authorities, he is left with no money to clear his loan. When Mr. Burnham proposes to settle the load for Halder's zamindary, Halder refuses the deal as the zamindary is his family's ancestral property and selling it would mean turning his back on his many dependents living in his household and zamindary. He is tried for forgery, but it is a sham trial orchestrated by Burnham and his cronies. The court punishes him by sentencing him to work as an indentured labourer for seven years in Mauritius. It is then that he meets Ah Fatt, a half-Chinese, half-Parsi opium addict from Canton, his sole companion in prison since the two will eventually be transported together on the Ibis.
The book also features Paulette, a French orphan, who has also grown up in India. Her father was an eccentric but kind botanist, and her mother died in childbirth. Mr. and Mrs. Burnham take Paulette into their home after her father's death. She becomes determined to run away because Mr. Burnham has behaved in a disturbing way with her in private. Also, he is trying to get her married to his friend, the stern, elderly Justice Kendalbushe. As it happens, Paulette had met Zachary Reid, the American sailor, at a dinner at the Burnhams'; she was instantly drawn to him, and he to her. She has resolved to travel to Mauritius, as her great-aunt did, in the hope of finding a better future. Along with Jodu, her childhood friend (or brother, as both Jodu and Paulette are brought up under the care of Jodu's mother following the death of Paulette's mother at childbirth), she boards the Ibis, unaware of her destiny. Paulette easily disguises herself as an Indian woman, using her fluent Bengali, which she learned in childhood growing up at close proximity with Jodu and his mother. Paulette's upbringing in India has also made her feel more at ease with Indian manners, food, and clothing than with Western ones.
As the stories merge, each carrying its share of joys and sorrows, the Ibis becomes a shelter to those in destitution.
After much strife and bloodshed on board the vessel, Neel, Ah Fatt, Jodu, Serang Ali and Kalua manage to escape, unaware of the destination the sea waves will carry them to.
Critical reception.
"Sea of Poppies" won the 2008 Vodafone Crossword Book Award for Fiction. It was shortlisted for the 2008 Booker Prize. It won the 2008 British Book Design and Production Award.

Bango (music)

Bango is a music style created and made popular at the East African Coast by Joseph Ngala. It fuses traditional Portuguese music genres, Arabic influenced taarab music, jazz and music genres of local coastal Bantu languages. It resembles easy listening music styles of Latin america such as bossa nova and music styles of many Indian Ocean Islands such as Seychelles and Mauritius. Joseph Ngala (also known by stage name ""Mzee Ngala"") is a renowned Kenyan Bango musician who comes from Freretown, Mombasa, and also the founder of the genre. He performed in the past with famous groups such as the Hodi Boys and was also founder and band leader of the 60s and 70s group Bahari Boys. In the band, he was their main composer and inspiration. In fact, Mzee Ngala's song "Bango" is the originator of the name Bango. The resilience of the name, Bango, is testament to the genre created by Mzee Ngala. Other notable Bango artists who have copied his style include Uyoga Band (formerly "Them Mushrooms"), Teusi 5, Bango Sounds e.t.c. Mzee Ngala still actively performs his music during events like the bi-annual Coast Night held in Nairobi and also in events all over the Coast province like Jamboree Club. Many, though not all, Bango songs are written and performed for and during weddings. Such hits include 'Jimmy na Anne' (written for Ngala's wedding to Anna), 'Billy na Susan', 'Kombe na Dogo' and the ever-popular 'David na Vera'.

Monti Dauni

The Monti Dauni (also known as Subappennino Dauno or Monti della Daunia) area a mountain chain in southern Italy, constituting the eastern appendix of the Campanian Apennines. They occupy the eastern fringe of Capitanata and the border of Apulia with Molise, and take their name from the ancient Dauni Italic tribe.
They are bounded northwards by the Fortore valley, eastwards by the Tavoliere delle Puglie, southwards by the upper Ofanto valley. The chain is formed by sandstone terrains, and is the source of a series of small streams which flow through the Tavoliere into the Adriatic Sea. The highest peak is the Monte Cornacchia, at 1,152 m.
Historically, the Monti Dauni area has suffered a substantial depopulation in the last decades, due to their relative isolation. They include 21 "comuni", all in the province of Foggia, which form two mountain communities ("Comunità Montana dei Monti Dauni Settentrionali ", with seat at Casalnuovo Monterotaro, and the "Comunità Montana dei Monti Dauni Meridionali", at Bovino).

Obvodny Canal

Obvodny Canal (, lit. Bypass Canal) is the longest canal in Saint Petersburg, Russia, which in the 19th century served as the southern limit of the city. It is 8 km long and flows from the Neva River near Alexander Nevsky Lavra to the Yekaterinhofka not far from the sea port. The canal was dug in 1769-1780 and 1805-1833.
