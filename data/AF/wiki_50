Val-des-Bois, Quebec

Val-des-Bois is a town and municipality in the Papineau Regional County Municipality in the Outaouais region of Quebec, Canada. The town is located on the eastern shores of the Du Lièvre River, north of Buckingham.
The main local economic activity depends on cottage tourism. The eastern half of the municipality is part of the Papineau-Labelle Wildlife Reserve.
Geography.
As part of the Laurentian Highlands, its territory is dotted with lakes such Écho, de l'Argile, de l'Aqueduc, Vert, and Delphis. Echo Lake lies at an altitude of , while the surrounding relief rises to above sea level.
History.
In 1873, the Township of Villeneuve was formed and named after Léonard-Vincent-Léon Villeneuve (1808-1873), member of Society of Saint-Sulpice, professor at the Petit Séminaire de Montréal (1838-1846), and pastor of Oka from 1871 to 1873.
In 1878, the local post office was named "Val-des-Bois". In 1883, the parish of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde was formed, and two years later, the United Township Municipality of Bowman-et-Villeneuve was established. In 1913, the townships separated, forming the Township Municipality of Bowman and the Township Municipality of Villeneuve. In 1929, James Maclaren began construction on a dam at the High Falls of the Lièvre River, displacing 21 families because of the rising waters.
In 1958, Villeneuve was renamed to Val-des-Bois (French for "Valley of the Woods"), in reference to the beautiful forest which decorated the banks of the Lièvre River.
On 23 June 2010 a 5.0 earthquake struck the region, with its epicentre 8 km from Val-des-Bois, which was the closest settlement.

Shamalangi

Shamalangi or Shyamalangi (pronounced ) is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 55th "melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 1st rāgam in the 10th "chakra Disi". The mnemonic name is "Disi-Pa". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ri gi mi pa dha na". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
"Shamalangi's swaras" are "chathusruthi rishabham, sadharana gandharam, prati madhyamam, shuddha dhaivatham" and "shuddha nishadham". As it is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "prati madhyamam" equivalent of "Jhankaradhwani", which is the 19th "melakarta" scale.
"Janya" rāgams.
"Shamalangi" has a couple of minor "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See List of "janya" rāgams for janya rāgams associated with "Shamalangi".

This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Shamalangi's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 2 minor "melakarta" rāgams "Ganamoorti" and "Vishwambari". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam.

Parallel 54°40′ north

Parallel 54°40′ north is a line of latitude between the 54th and 55th parallels north that forms the southernmost boundary between the U.S. State of Alaska and the Canadian Province of British Columbia. The boundary was originally established as a result of tri-partite negotiations between the Russian Empire, the British Empire and the United States, resulting in parallel treaties in 1824 and 1825.
History.
The Russo-American Treaty of 1824 established the boundary between Russian Alaska and overlapping British and US claims at the parallel 54°40′ north effective January 12, 1825, a delineation which was repeated in the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825 between the Empire of Russia and the United Kingdom. Specifically, it was agreed, in the 1824 treaty, that no American settlement would be established on the coast or adjacent island north of 54°40′, and no Russian settlement to the south (Russian Fort Ross was in Mexican California and was outside the purview of the treaty). The treaty did not make any explicit statements about sovereignty or territorial claims. The 1825 treaty with Britain was more strongly worded and defined the boundary between Russian and British possessions in North America, which ran north from 54°40′ through what is now the Alaska Panhandle to the 141st meridian west, then along that line north to the Arctic Ocean.
The Colony of British Columbia was established on August 2, 1858. The United States purchased Alaska from the Empire of Russia for $7,200,000 in 1867. Russian America became the United States Department of Alaska on October 18, 1867.
The Province of British Columbia joined the Confederation of Canada on July 21, 1871.
The United States created the District of Alaska on May 17, 1884, and the Territory of Alaska on August 24, 1912. The State of Alaska was admitted to the Union on January 3, 1959.

Papyrus 49

Papyrus 49 (Gregory-Aland), designated by formula_149, is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Epistle to the Ephesians, surviving in a fragmentary condition. The manuscript has been palaeographically assigned to the 3rd century. It was probably a part of the same manuscript as Papyrus 65. It came from Egypt and was purchased for the Yale University Library. Textually it is close to the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. The text of the manuscript has been published several times.
Description.
The original size of the leaf was 18 centimetres in height by 25 centimetres in width. The leaf is damaged at the top, and six lines of its text have been lost. At the present time the leaf measures 20.3 cm by 13.3 cm. The lower and outer margins are 3 centimetres wide; the upper and inner margins were lost.
The manuscript has survived in a fragmentary condition and contains the texts of Ephesians 4:16-29; 4:31-5:13. According to Kurt Aland, it is one of three early manuscripts with the text of the Epistle to the Ephesians.
The text is written in one column per page of 29 lines, with 38 letters per line (average). It has no breathings (spiritus asper, spiritus lenis) nor accents. The double point (:) is the only mark of punctuation. The letters are slightly inclined to the right; the writing shows the influence of cursive handwriting. It was written by a professional scribe. The nomina sacra are written in an abbreviated way.
The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type. Aland ascribed it as “at least Normal text”, and placed it in Category I. Bruce M. Metzger identifies it as Alexandrian text. According to Philip Comfort and David Barrett the manuscript shows a strong agreement with Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus (in 14 out of 16 textual variants).
According to Comfort, formula_149 and formula_165 came from the same manuscript. Both manuscripts have the same measurements, and the same number of lines per page. Both were written by a documentary hand, both manifest the same formation of certain letters, such as titled lambda, titled sigma, extended iota, and toiled ypsilon. The nomina sacra and abbreviations are written in the same rather unusual way. Bradford Welles remarks that "there is not a single case of difference in the letter shapes in the two papyri". Neither use ligatures. The only difference is in the number of letters per line: formula_165 has more letters per line (42). The same situation exists in Papyrus 75. The scribe of formula_175 appears to have realized that he was running out of room in his codex and added three letters in each line and even added extra lines. The manuscript may be one of the earliest manuscripts to display a complete Pauline codex, along with Papyrus 13, Papyrus 15/Papyrus 16, Papyrus 30, Papyrus 46, and Papyrus 92.
In Ephesians 4:23, formula_149 has the rare textual reading ("in spirit") instead of the reading ("spirit"). The reading of the codex is supported by Codex Vaticanus, minuscule 33, 1175, 1739, 1881 and several other manuscripts.
In Ephesians 4:28, it has the unusual textual reading ταις χερσιν το αγαθον, supported only by formula_7, second corrector of the Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, Old-Latin a, and vgst. The rest of the manuscripts have the readings: το αγαθον (Porphyrianus, minuscule 6, 33, 1739, 1881); το αγαθον ταις χερσιν (Angelicus, Athous Lavrensis, 323, 326, 614, 630, 945); το αγαθον ταις ιδιαις χερσιν (Codex Mosquensis I, 2495); ταις ιδιαις χερσιν το αγαθον (Codex Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, Codex Bezae, Augiensis, Boernerianus, 81, 104, 365, 1175, 1241, 2464, vgcl).
In Ephesians 5:4, it has the textual reading και ("and"), supported by formula_7, first corrector of the Codex Sinaiticus (א1), Codex Vaticanus, second corrector of the Codex Bezae, manuscripts of the Byzantine textual tradition, Peshitta, Coptic manuscripts in Bohairic dialect; the other reading η ("or") is supported by Codex Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, Bezae, Augiensis, Boernerianus, Porphyrianus, minuscule 81, 104, 326, 365, 1175, 1241, 1739, 2464, Old-Latin manuscripts, syrh, and Coptic manuscripts in Sahidic dialect.
In Ephesians 5:5, it has the textual reading ο εστιν ("who is"), supported by the manuscripts: formula_7, Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, Augiensis, Boernerianus, Athous Lavrensis, 33, 365, 1175, 1739, 1881, 2464, Old-Latin, Peshitta, Coptic manuscripts (Sahidic and Bohairic); the other reading ος εστιν ("who is") is supported by Codex Alexandrinus, Codex Bezae, and manuscripts of the Byzantine textual tradition.
In Ephesians 5:9, it has the textual reading φωτος ("light"), supported by Codex Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, Vaticanus, Bezae, Augiensis, Boernerianus, Porphyrianus, minuscule 6, 33, 81, 629, 1175c, 1739, 1881, 2464, some Old-Latin manuscripts, Peshitta and Coptic manuscripts. The reading πνευματος ("spirit") is found in the manuscripts formula_7, D2, Ψ, majority of the Byzantine manuscripts and syrh.
History.
The handwriting of the manuscript displays many third-century features. Comfort dated the manuscript to the middle of the third century. It is presently assigned to the third century on palaeographic grounds by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research (INTF). It was probably written in Egypt, but it cannot be assigned to any particular locality.
The manuscript was purchased in Cairo for Yale University in February 1931. Its provenance prior to Cairo is not known. Currently it is housed at the Yale University Library (P. Yale 415) in New Haven.
The text of the codex was published by William Hatch and Bradford Welles in 1958 ("editio princeps"). Kurt Aland catalogued the manuscript on the list of the New Testament papyri under the number 49.
Susan Stephens gave a new and complete transcription of the codex in 1985. Comfort and Barrett again gave a new reconstruction in 1999.
Vittorio Bartoletti (1920–1990) was the first to note that Papyrus 49 and Papyrus 65 were produced by the same scribe. This conclusion was confirmed by Bradford Welles, Comfort and Barrett, and other palaeographers. They are still catalogued as separate manuscripts on the INTF's list.

Prussian G 4.1

The Prussian Class G 4 were German, six-coupled, goods train, steam locomotives with a boiler pressure of 12 bar, built primarily for the Prussian state railways. Classified by the state railway in 1905, they included 16 locomotives from the railway division of Mainz, that originally came from the Hessian Ludwigsbahn. These earlier locomotives were delivered between 1872 and 1896 and did not meet the Prussian norms.
The later G 4.1 engines were an evolutionary development of the Prussian G 3, but their higher boiler pressure enable a significant increase in power to be achieved. Between 1884 and 1901 some 165 G 4.1 locomotives were delivered; in addition there were numerous conversions of locomotives which originally had a 10 bar boiler pressure. However not all of them were designated as G 4 engines.
In 1923 the Deutsche Reichsbahn planned to incorporate 92 of these locomotives in its renumbering plan as 53 7601 - 7692. But by 1925 only locomotive numbers 53 7601 - 7617 were included. They were retired by 1930.
The Lübeck-Büchen Railway (LBE) also owned two locomotives of this class, built in 1892 and 1893, but they classified them as "G 3"s and had retired them by 1923.
The Class G 4.1 engines were coupled to Prussian pr 3 T 12 tenders.

Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière

The portrait of Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière was painted in 1806 by the French Neoclassical artist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and today hangs in the Louvre. It is the third of three portraits of the Rivière family the artist painted that year. Caroline's father, Philibert Rivière, was a successful court official under Napoleon's empire, and sought to commemorate himself, his wife and daughter through a commission with the then young and rising artist - his portraits of Philibert and his wife are also still extant. Although Ingres favoured subject matter drawn from history or Greek legend, at this early stage in his career he earned his living mainly through commissions from wealthy patrons. The family lived outside Paris, at St. Germain-en-Laye, and 
Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière would have been between 13 and 15 at the time she was portrayed; according to Ingres the "ravishing daughter".
The younger Rivière's portrait describes slightly built and youthful femininity and hints at a hesitant openness. The painting is rendered in bright hues and set against a serene white–blue early spring landscape, the freshness of which was intended to reflect the youth of the sitter. The background is not deeply portrayed; the perspective is shallow and rises—according to the art historian Robert Rosenblum—in "flattened horizontal tiers against which the figure seems crisply silhouetted as if in low relief." 
Typical of portraits by Ingres of the time, Caroline Rivière is drawn with a disregard for anatomical accuracy. Her neck is overly elongated, and the bridge of her nose extends too far. Rivière is portrayed with a stiffness and awkwardness typical of her age, and shown in a manner which was intended to emphasise a sense of the nascent purity and simplicity of her youth. Yet the painting is generally seen in the light of pathos and tragedy, as the sitter died within a year of the work being completed.
It was, along with Ingres's two other portrayals of the family, exhibited in the 1806 Salon, but was poorly received for its perceived "Gothicness" (due to its precision of line and enamel finish) and its similarity to Jan van Eyck and other artists of Early Netherlandish painting (in French "Les Primitifs Flamands") who at the time were only just being rediscovered. Further, the manner in which the whiteness of the sitter's dress contrasts with the curve of her boa offended some viewers. Today the painting is typically seen as a peak in Ingres's artistic career, and in this work Ingres introduces an emotional link between figurative and landscape art, and the watery scape behind the sitter evokes rhythms with many of the visual themes presented in the rich imagery of the foreground.
In 2003, the art critic Jonathan Jones remarked of the painting,
The sexuality Ingres usually reserved for harem fantasies slips over into the real and respectable world in this charged portrait. His obviously intense visual relationship with his subject and his contentment to look, with a clinical waxy fetishism, at Mademoiselle Rivière's full lips, bared neck, long gloves and spectacularly serpentine boa, lend this picture drama."
"Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière" was bequeathed to the Louvre in 1870 by Caroline Rivière's sister-in-law.

Vee Bar Ranch Lodge

The Vee Bar Ranch Lodge was built in 1891 as the home of Lionel C.G. Sartoris, a prominent Wyoming rancher. The ranch was later owned by Luther Filmore, a Union Pacific Railroad official, and the Wright family, who operated the ranch as a dude ranch. The property comprises five historic buildings including the lodge, original corral and a stock chute.
Sartoris bought the Vee Bar lands from homesteader Theodore Brubaker in 1890. Sartoris was English in origin, and a partner in the Douglas William Sartoris Cattle Company, which in 1885 was worth an estimated $2 million. By 1892 the company had failed. Sartoris departed for South America and the ranch was taken over by Susan J. Fillmore, who from 1903 leased it to Gordon and Myra Wright. In 1911 the Wrights bought the ranch, adding a second floor to the lodge. Dude ranching began in 1912 to supplement income.
The ranch is situated in a bend of the Little Laramie River with five contributing buildings and supporting ranch structures. The original log lodge was built by the Fillmores in 1901 and expanded in 1911. A modern addition dates to 1975.
The Vee Bar was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. It continues in operation as a guest ranch.

Martineau family

The Martineau Family was a political dynasty from Birmingham, England. Several of them were prominent Unitarians, to the extent that a room in Essex Hall, the headquarters building of the British Unitarians, was named after them.
Mayors of Birmingham.
Members included five generations, father to son, of Mayors or Lord Mayors of Birmingham:
A blue plaque, erected in 2008 by the Birmingham Civic Society, in Birmingham Council House commemorates all five.
Martineau family of Norwich.
The Norwich Martineaus were founded by Huguenot immigrants, and were noted in the medical, intellectual and business fields. They were initially Calvinist dissenters, who brought their children up as bilingual in French and English. The founder, Gaston Martineau, was a surgeon in Dieppe, and moved to Norwich after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes of 1685. His grandson David Martineau II (1726–1768) was the third generation of surgeons, and had five sons who made up the male line of Martineaus. By the fourth generation the family was divided into Anglicans and Unitarians.
The eldest of the five sons was Philip Meadows Martineau (1752–1829), surgeon and "one of the most distinguished Lithomists of his day". Apprenticed to the surgeon William Donne, who was noted for skill in lithotomy, he became a medical student at a number of universities, then returned in 1777 to become Donne's partner, and carried on his speciality. Henry Southey was his student. He had one daughter. The second son David Martineau (four sons, six daughter) was a dyer who went into the sugar business. The third, Peter Finch Martineau (four sons, two daughter) was a dyer in Norwich. The fourth son, John Martineau of Stamford Hill, had 14 children, including John Martineau the engineer. The fifth son Thomas is mentioned below.
Family of Thomas Martineau.
Several of the Martineaus are buried in Key Hill Cemetery, Birmingham, either in the family grave or a separate one.
Thomas Martineau, a manufacturer of textiles, was the fifth son of David Martineau II. He was a Unitarian, a deacon of the Octagon Chapel from 1797. He married Elizabeth Rankin (8 October 1772 – 26 August 1848). They lived in Norwich and had eight children.
The Martineau-Lupton clan counted many aldermen and lord mayors, in both Leeds and Birmingham, amongst their kin. Their Unitarian faith and Liberal (unionist) political beliefs resulted in their combined commitment to many national, and international issues well into the 20th century: Alderman Robert Francis Martineau welcomed the American abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, to his home when the American visited Birmingham on 7 July 1877 and two days later, Martineau's relative, Joseph Lupton, had Garrison as a guest at his Leeds house from 9–15 July.

Ivan Muravyov-Apostol

Ivan Matveyevich Muravyov-Apostol (; – ) was a Russian statesman and writer.
Ivan Muravyov-Apostol came from an old notable family. His father was military engineer Matvei Muravyov and his mother was Elena Apostol, granddaughter of a Ukrainian hetman Danylo Apostol) (Ivan adopted the last name Muravyov-Apostol at solicitation of his cousin in 1800). Ivan Muravyov-Apostol himself was the father of three Decembrists (besides seven other children) – lieutenant colonel Matvey Muravyov-Apostol (1793-1886), lieutenant colonel Sergey Muravyov-Apostol (1796–1826), and warrant officer Ippolit Muravyov-Apostol (1806–1826). 
Ivan Muravyov-Apostol was born near the town of Borovichi in Novgorod guberniya. In 1773, he was turned soldier of the Izmaylovsky Regiment. In 1776–1777, Ivan Muravyov-Apostol attended Leonhard Euler's boarding school and then was home-schooled after its closing. In October 1784, he joined the staff of Saint Petersburg Governor-General Yakov Bruce first as a legal adviser, then as an aide-de-camp (1785), and second major (1788). Also, Muravyov-Apostol served at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the Purveyance Department and supervised the Schlisselburg canal as a Premier Major. In 1792, Muravyov-Apostol was introduced to the court of Catherine the Great as a tutor of Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich and Konstantin Pavlovich. He was then appointed a marshal of ceremonies. Muravyov-Apostol managed to gain the affection of Catherine the Great and even Pavel Petrovich (future emperor), which would affect his further career quite favorably. In December 1796, Ivan Muravyov-Apostol (already Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich’s chamberlain) was sent as a resident minister to Eutin to represent Russia at the court of Duke Peter of Holstein-Gottorp and Bishop of Lübeck. He combined this post with a similar post in Hamburg (1798) and Copenhagen (late 1799). As a diplomat, Ivan Muravyov-Apostol applied efforts to intensify the activity of the Second Coalition against France. He was a polyglot and was able to speak eight foreign languages, including a few ancient ones. In 1800, Ivan Muravyov-Apostol was recalled to Russia and promoted to privy councilor. In 1801, he was appointed vice president of the Collegium of Foreign Affairs (Ministry of Foreign Affairs). Ivan Muravyov-Apostol never supported Paul I (despite the latter’s benevolence towards him) and took part in the 1801 conspiracy against the emperor, becoming the author of one of the unrealized draft laws on legal restriction of sovereign power. In 1802, he was appointed Russia’s envoy to Spain, only to be dismissed four years later for some obscure reasons. Ivan Muravyov-Apostol was not in the service until 1824. That same year he became a member of the Governing Senate and a member of the General Board of Educational Institutions (Главное училищ правление). In the 1820s, Ivan Muravyov-Apostol’s liberal views on certain issues received much public attention and gained him prominence. For example, he made a stand for Vasili Popov, the director of the Department of Public Education, who had taken part in the translation of a mystical book by Johannes Gossner banned in Russia. Also, Ivan Muravyov-Apostol asserted the right of universities and professors to make use of books disregarding the official censorship. He stood for the teaching of philosophy at the universities, contravening the official stance of a powerful statesman, Mikhail Magnitsky, who had been overseeing the educational affairs at that time.
In 1826, the family of Ivan Muravyov-Apostol suffered through an immense tragedy. After the suppression of the Decembrist Revolt, his youngest son Ippolit Muravyov-Apostol shot himself, not wanting to surrender to the authorities. His older son Sergey Muravyov-Apostol was hanged with four other leading Decembrists. His oldest son Matvey Muravyov-Apostol was sentenced to 15 years of katorga, which would later be changed to exile in Siberia. Ivan Muravyov-Apostol left the service after the revolt and was then officially discharged in May 1826. He was registered as an "absent" senator up until 1847, all that time living mainly in Vienna and Florence. Ivan Muravyov-Apostol’s name completely disappeared from the mainstream Russian press from 1826 until the late 1850s (even though he returned to Russia in the 1840s). 
Ivan Muravyov-Apostol died in Saint Petersburg in March 1851 and was interred at the Georgiyevskoye Cemetery.
Ivan Muravyov-Apostol is also known to have been a litterateur. He participated in the proceedings of a literary club called Conversations of the Admirers of the Russian Language ("Беседы любителей русского слова"). Also, Ivan Muravyov-Apostol was a member of the Free Society of the Admirers of the Russian Literature (Вольное общество любителей российской словесности). He was an active member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (since 1811) and honorary member of Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Ivan Muravyov-Apostol’s most significant work was a book called "Journey across Taurida in 1820". It contains valuable information on archaeology, flora and fauna of the Crimea, unique features of urban, rural and monastic life of this region, and colorful depictions of oriental customs. 
According to testimonies of Ivan Muravyov-Apostol’s contemporaries (such as Konstantin Batyushkov, Nikolai Grech and others), he was a man of a brilliant mind, esthete, polyglot, and bibliophile. Ivan Muravyov-Apostol ranged almost all of Europe and met many prominent people, such as Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, Vittorio Alfieri, and George Byron. He is known to have been a tyrant to his family members, an epicurean, and a squanderer (dissipated several millions of rubles of fortune).

The Skies are Closer in Homesh

The Skies are Closer in Homesh is a highly personal documentary that follows a newly wed Jewish couple through their first few years of married life on a dangerous Israeli settlement.
Summary.
The diarist documentary exposes what life is like for Menorah, a young and nervous settler, who was married on the day of a terrorist attack, spent her honeymoon trapped inside her home because of terrorism, and sleeps with a gun under her pillow.
The film follows the evolution of her relationship with both her husband and her home through their crucial early stages. From a terrorist attack the night of Passover that murdered close friends to the birth of her first child, Menorah turns on her camera to share highly personal moments.
Menorah's faith is strong, but at times she wonders why she's chosen to live on a settlement. The view from the high hilltop is breathtaking, and she loves her neighbors. But there are only three families living in their area, and the hours she spends waiting for her husband to come home from work are lonely.
One of the film's most revealing moments comes when Menorah tries to learn how to use a gun. She says she’s never felt comfortable with guns. But given the realities of traveling alone, she’s had to reconsider. At one point, Menorah is seen standing in her kitchen, pregnant, practicing with her gun. She and her husband act out situations that would demand she act swiftly and agilely, but Menorah can't touch the gun without fumbling. The delicate woman has a hard time keeping a straight face and keeps laughing that the gun holster makes her look like a cowgirl.

<doc id="19960869" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19960869" title="GULAG Operation">
GULAG Operation

GULAG Operation (translated from a news article on "Desant na GULAG"), was a German military operation in which German and Russian anti-communist troops were to create an anti-Soviet resistance movement in Siberia during World War II, by liberating and conscripting prisoners of the Soviet GULAG system.
Origins.
The plan was designed in mid-1942 by Soviet POWs in German captivity in the Hammelburg POW camp, primarily by an NKVD officer, Brigade Commander Ivan Georgievich Bessonov, and a Red Army officer, Colonel Mikhael Meandrov. The plan, part of the German efforts to create anti-communist resistance behind Soviet lines, called for a naval and air invasion of Siberia by allied German and anti-Soviet Russian forces, targeting the GULAG penal system camps, recruiting more anti-Soviet forces from the prisoners, and thus opening a second front in the war between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union.
The plan was analyzed and tentatively approved by the Reich Security Head Office (RSHA), and steps were taken towards implementing it. About 150 Soviet POWs were conscripted into the units that were to be used in the operation: two assault groups of 50-55 people each, the group of the radio operators of 20-25 people and the support (medical) female group of 20 people.
The plan called for the creation of an insurgent activity in the extensive region from the Northern Dvina River to the Yenisey and from the extreme north to the Trans-Siberian Railway. The region of the planned actions was divided into three operational zones: Northern (right shore of the flow of northern Dvina), central (near the Pechora River) and eastern (from the Ob River to the Yenisey). Landing force members had to seize the GULAGS, free and arm the prisoners and deportees and move with them in the general direction to the south.
Implementation.
On 2 June 1943 a first group of 12 former Soviet POWs, trained by the Germans, were dropped by an air transport in the Komi Republic. They were dressed as fake NKVD troops. On 9 June the group was however found (two killed, rest taken prisoner) by real NKVD troops.
Aftermath.
Soon after this failure, the Germans decided to abandon the operation; the anti-communist group that Bessonov founded in the POW camp was disbanded, and he himself was transferred to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.
Some of Bessonov's organization members were employed in other German anti-Soviet operations, without any notable successes. Bessonov and Meandrov survived the war to be executed by the Soviet authorities after being transferred to their custody.

Ohio State Route 153

State Route 153 (SR 153) is a long east–west state highway in the northeastern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. The western terminus of SR 153 is at a signalized intersection with southbound SR 43 in Canton, along a stretch of SR 43 where that highway is divided into a one-way couplet. SR 153 has its eastern endpoint at SR 183 nearly south of Alliance.
Route description.
All of SR 153 is situated within the eastern half of Stark County. No part of this state highway is included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of routes determined to be most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.
History.
The SR 153 designation was established in 1932. Its original routing consisted of the portion of the existing alignment of SR 153 between its western terminus at SR 43 in Canton and its junction with SR 44 in Louisville. SR 153 replaced what was a portion of SR 44 before that highway was re-routed to continue due south from Louisville toward East Canton. In 1937, SR 153 was extended east from Louisville to its present eastern terminus at SR 183, which at the time carried the SR 80 designation. The extension utilized a county-maintained roadway.

Reviews.
"There is more than one female voice at the O'Keefe Centre this week, as there has been for the past six. Accompanying herself on piano, a singer named Monica Kim has been performing in the front lobby before each show and in the O'Keefe bar after. She has a lovely, clear soprano and when she sings Streisand standards like Evergreen, the resemblance is uncanny.
In slow ballads she is impeccable. It is almost impossible to warm the O'Keefe lobby, but Miss Kim, who continues to attract a good audience before each show is winning".

Chaudayyadanapura

Chaudayyadanapura is a small village in Ranebennur taluk of Haveri District in Karnataka state of India. All facets of Indian civilisation (religion, art and poetry) are exemplified in an exquisite Mukteshwara temple, with the highest degree of refinement.
Introduction.
Northern Karnataka is one of the richest areas of India in monuments of great artistic value. It was the time of the greatest expansion of the Kalamukha Lakulasaiva movements and of the rise of Virashaivism.
Shivapura, the old name of Chaudadanapura (Chaudayyadanapura) saint, a 12th-century social reformer Basaveshwara, donated this village to Ambigara Chaudayya (a boatman). So the name is Chaudayyadanapura or Chaudadanapura. 
The temple of Muktesvara at Chaudayyadanapura in Ranebennur Taluk is a beautiful representative of the style and the high culture of that time.
The Mukteshvara Temple.
The Mukteshvara Temple is a single cella temple in Jakkanachari style. Similar temples were built under the patronage of Kalachuri or Seuna dynasties. This temple is a jewel of architecture of the 11th–12th centuries. It was built during the heyday of the kingdom ruled by the Kalyani Chalukyas and the Seunas of Devagiri. It is dedicated to an Udbhava (spontaneously born) Linga named Mukteshvara.
The dome of the temple is hollow and is closed by the slabs of the stupi. Sikhara of the Mukteshwara temple is 2.2 m in its axis at the base. The stupi is made of three beautiful lotiform mouldings diminishing in size and a lotus bud with its base.
Kannada inscriptions.
History.
The history of Mukteshvara Temple at Chaudayyadanapura is known through seven inscriptions in medieval Kannada, engraved on large steles. They provide information on the local rulers, kings of Guttala (Gupta ascendancy), on some constructions in the temple complex, on diverse donations to the deity.
They provide the details on a prominent religious leaders. Inscriptions introduce Muktajiyar, a Lakulasaiva saint, and Shivadeva, a Virashaiva saint, who entered the place on the 19 August 1225 and led there a long life of renunciation, asceticism and spiritual elevation. The legacy of this age of intense Shaivism is a jewel of architecture and sculpture.
Conservation and restoration.

Ben Barzman (October 12, 1910 – December 15, 1989) was a Canadian journalist, screenwriter, and novelist. 
Career.
He was born in Toronto, Ontario. He is best known as a writer or co-writer of more than 20 films, from "You're a Lucky Fellow, Mr. Smith" (1943) to "The Head of Normande St. Onge" (1975).
HUAC.
Like many of his colleagues in the movie business, Ben Barzman was blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee. Anticipating things to come, he first went to the U.K. in 1949 to work on the film "Give Us This Day" (also known as "Christ in Concrete"). In the 1950s he moved to southern France, with his wife Norma Barzman, who was also a screenwriter of Hollywood films such as "The Locket" (1946). He sometimes wrote scripts anonymously, or used various assumed names.
Writing.
In 1960, Barzman emerged as a science fiction author, with his novel "Out of This World". It deals with the idea of Earth having a planet twin, a parallel world in the same orbit, but hidden from our view by the sun itself. The two planets have developed almost identically from their creation away back, with the same countries, history, languages, and even, strangely enough, people. The big difference is that World War II never happened on the other Earth.

War Is Hell (comics)

War Is Hell was a horror/war comic book series from Marvel Comics in 1973–1975. For its first six issues, it featured reprints of old war comics, followed by two issues of reprints of "Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos". Beginning in issue #9, the series featured new material; the star of the series became Death, who forced a dishonorable Polish man named John Kowalski, killed in the Invasion of Poland (1939), to die countless deaths from other lives. A "War Is Hell" limited series featuring Phantom Eagle appeared in 2008.
John Kowalski.
During the series, Kowalski inhabited different bodies of those about to die, not necessarily of the same side or gender, during World War II, including both the European and Pacific theatres, and needed to change things for the better before he was killed. Death would summon him from the nether regions each story, and Kowalski wondered how many times he would have to do so as penance. The series was created by writers Tony Isabella, Roy Thomas, and Chris Claremont with an uncredited assist from Steve Gerber on issue #9 (acknowledged in the letter column of issue #12), and artists Dick Ayers and Frank Springer.
The series was canceled with issue #15, and we learned Claremont's intentions for Kowalski when he wrote volume 2 of "Man-Thing" and incorporated the character into its final two issues (#s 10 & 11). By this point (the early 1980s), Kowalski had become an aspect of Death. He made Barbie Bannister (a recently orphaned by murder rich girl introduced by Claremont in "Man-Thing" vol. 2 #5) another aspect of Death as they battled Sheriff John Daltry, who was possessed by the sword of Captain Fate. He caused the deaths of Doctor Strange, Man-Thing, Jennifer Kale, and Chris Claremont himself, although these deaths were undone by the end of the story, in order to battle Thog the Nether-Spawn, who was using Fate and Daltry as his pawns in another gambit to take over Earth-616.
Kowalski later appeared with Scarlet Witch in a story by Dennis Mallonee (writer) and John Ridgway (artist) in "Solo Avengers" #5.
Phantom Eagle.
In 2008, a new five-issue limited series, titled "War Is Hell: The First Flight of Phantom Eagle", appeared under the MAX imprint. Phantom Eagle (Lt. Karl Kaufman) was a World War I hero created by Gary Friedrich and artist Herb Trimpe (artist) in 1968, and the new story was by Garth Ennis (writer) and Howard Chaykin (artist).
Reprints.
The series began as a reprint book, mostly from Atlas Comics-era war comics, adding Sgt. Fury for its last two issues before printing new material. The first six issues contained four stories an issue, each around five pages.

It was built to implement a new combined fire and police "silent alarm" system in the early 1920s, using telephone wires instead of human bell-ringers. This represented the last step in Troy's efforts to prevent the devastating fires of the 19th century from destroying so much of the city again. It continued to be used for that purpose until 1968, and in 2003 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Jim Jones said "I was going home one day, and DJ Jazzy Joyce — at 4:30 in the morning — was playing the Jones recalled of the first time he heard "Pop Champagne." "And I know how much Ron wanted to become an artist and break into the game. ... So when I heard it, I was like, 'Damn, it got a good sound.' ... I was just being courteous, as he did so many hot beats for me. ... So, I jumped on the track, like, 'Let's see what it do.' It started to sound a little bit crazy, and I said, 'Well, let's see if we put Juelz Santana on it how crazy could it get.

On the Green Carpet

On the Green Carpet is a 2001 North Korean film directed by Rim Chang-bom. The film's title refers to the turf of the stadium which hosts the May Day mass games in Pyongyang.
Summary.
The film is a romantic comedy, which involves a coach who is preparing a group of schoolchildren for the May Day mass games, and a former colleague who has now become his superior. She feels that he is being too demanding of his young performers, as the show he has devised requires a series of multiple somersaults. However, the children are willing to work as hard as necessary to please their leader, Kim Jong-il, and the film culminates in a lavish display of their abilities.
Everyday life in North Korea is presented as being pleasant and trouble-free, with no evidence of reported food shortages and an emphasis on the people's devotion to the "Dear Leader".
Festival screenings and critical response.
"On the Green Carpet" was the first North Korean film to be invited to the Berlin International Film Festival, where it was screened in 2004 as a special one-off event. It had been chosen by the festival committee from a selection of ten films, and aroused a great deal of interest despite being shown without subtitles and with a German language-only voice-over. The predominantly German audience who saw the film later criticized it for its "Nazi-style propaganda". Sheila Johnson of "FIPRESCI" regarded it as a "rare and fascinating curiosity", but noted: "On the Green Carpet, with its flat, high-key lighting, functional editing and over-fondness for the zoom lens, could have been made forty years ago; although the subject might be superficially similar, it was executed with none of the technical brilliance of a Leni Riefenstahl movie."
"On the Green Carpet" has previously been screened at the 23rd Moscow International Film Festival in 2001.

Tara Moore

Tara Shanice Moore (born 6 August 1992) is a British professional tennis player. She is currently the British No. 4, with a career-high of World No. 183 in August 2013. So far in her career she has won 6 ITF singles titles and 4 ITF doubles titles. Her career-high doubles ranking is world no. 207, reached on 5 August 2013.
As a junior she was coached by the esteemed American tennis coach, Nick Bollettieri, who has previously coached champions such as Andre Agassi, Serena Williams, Monica Seles and Mary Pierce. In September 2006 he referred to Tara as one of the best young players in his school, the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy, along with Michelle Larcher de Brito. Her favourite surface is stated as being grass although most of her titles to date have come on hard court.
Career.
2006–2007.
Tara's first professional tennis match came in August 2006 at the $10,000 ITF tournament in Guayaquil, Ecuador. She won two matches to qualify before losing in the first round of the tournament. Moore then moved on to qualify and reach the quarterfinals in only the second ITF tournament of her career in Caracas, Venezuela, another $10,000 event.
2007 didn't start badly for Tara; she reached the quarterfinals of another $10,000 ITF event in Irapuato before losing to Ana-Clara Duarte of Brazil in straight sets. In July she entered her first $25,000 ITF tournament in Felixstowe, Great Britain where she lost in the qualifying stages. Her next two tournaments were both $10,000 ITFs in Great Britain (Ilkley and Wrexham) and she managed to reach the quarterfinal stages of both of these. She ended the year with three consecutive first round losses in $25,000 events. Her year-end ranking for 2007 was world no. 823.
2008.
April and May 2008 resulted in three failures to qualify for ITF tournaments, two of which were $25,000 events, the other a $50,000. She became a quarterfinalist yet again in her next tournament, the $10,000 ITF in Izmir, Turkey. She then began a successful grass court season with a wildcard into the qualifying tournament of Wimbledon where she lost in the first round after a valiant three-set battle against former top-40 player Olga Puchkova of Russia, 6–4 6–7(0) 4–6. She followed this up immediately with her first ever semifinal in the $25,000 tournament held in Felixstowe and continued the momentum in the following tournament ($10,000 Frinton) where she won, beating fellow teenager Mona Barthel of Germany, 7–5 6–1 in the final.
Her next noteworthy result of 2008 came on the ITF tour in early November at the $10,000 event in Sunderland, England. She won through two tough three-set matches in the first and second rounds before winning her quarterfinal match in two sets and coming up against teenage sensation, Laura Robson, in one of two all-British semifinals. She lost in straight sets, 3–6 3–6 to Robson (who was the eventual champion). Immediately after this was the $10,000 tournament in Jersey. In the second round of this tournament she played a rematch of her second round match in the previous tournament in Sunderland. She beat Tetyana Arefyeva in three sets for the second time in two weeks to reach the quarter-final stage where she was beaten by Katarzyna Piter, 4–6 2–6. She ended 2008 with a singles ranking of world no. 712.
2009.
Tara struggled throughout 2009 and did not go beyond the quarter finals in any of the events she competed in. Tara enjoyed a straight sets win over former top 20 player Eleni Daniilidou of Greece as she qualified for the $50,000 event in Nottingham. Tara also competed at the ITF junior events at Roehampton and Wimbledon but surprisingly lost early in both events as she was drawn against junior world number 3 Tímea Babos of Hungary. Post Wimbledon  Tara' best result was qualifying for a $75,000 event in Shrewsbury before losing to German Angelique Kerber 6–2 6–1. Tara was also asked to leave the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) National Tennis Centre (NTC) as a result of her perceived lack of professionalism and poor attitude, Tara would end the year in India before heading back to Hong Kong.
2010.
2010 started very much as 2009 ended for Tara with early loses in her first handful of events. Tara was training and working out of Hong Kong following her expulsion from the Lawn Tennis Association although in March Tara began working with British tennis coach John Morris who is also the coach of Tímea Babos, ranked a lowly 790 on the WTA world rankings Tara moved back to Britain to train at Gosling Tennis Academy under the watchful eye of John Morris. Tara's results started to pick up in spring time of 2010 as she reached the final of the ITF women's $10,000 event in Edinburgh losing to stable mate Tímea Babos, Tara followed this up with her first career top 100 win at the ITF women's $50,000 event in Nottingham beating Kai-Chen Chang in 3 tough sets. During the grass court season Tara represented Great Britain in the Maureen Connolly trophy, a sign that the LTA were beginning to see the improvements in Tara both on and off court. This was quickly followed by a WC in to the ITF junior event at Roehampton where Tara beat world junior number 1 Daria Gavrilova 6–0 6–1 before beating the 2010 Australian Open junior champion Karolína Plíšková 6–3 6–1 but Tara found Karolina's twin sister Kristýna Plíšková too hot to handle as Pliskova achieved a rare double of winning both titlea at Roehampton and Wimbledon. On to Wimbledon Tara had some impressive wins and reached her first grand slam quarter final where she played fellow Brit Laura Robson and despite controlling much of the match Tara lost in 2 set although she put herself firmly on the tennis map during the grass court season and credited John Morris for much of the improvements. Post Wimbledon Tara won her 2nd career title at the ITF women's $10,000 event in Chiswick as well as her first ITF women's doubles title alongside Fran Stephenson at the $25,000 in Wrexham beating Sania Mirza and Emma Laine in the final. Tara would go on to have a very solid autumn reaching several quarter and semi finals before ending the year at the $75,000 event in Dubai. Tara was able to achieve several career high rankings through the year and ended 2010 ranked 370. Tara also became a professional in Aug 2010 when she signed professional terms with London based management company Global Tennis Connections (GTC), she also signed a long term deal with Adidas International on the back of her upsurge in form and ranking.
2011.
Tara was runner-up in the ITF women's $10K tournament in Sunderland, UK, and won the ITF women's $10K in Loughborough, UK, where she also won the doubles, partnering countywoman Francesca Stephenson. She also reached doubles finals in ITF women's $10K tournaments in Istanbul partnering Lisa Whybourn, and in Bath, UK, partnering Emma Laine. She ended 2011 with a singles ranking of 332.
2012.
Tara won no titles in 2012, but finished as runner up in singles in the ITF women's $50K tournament in Kazan, Russia, and in doubles, partnering fellow Brit Lucy Brown in the ITF women's $10K in Antalya, Turkey. However, she improved her ranking throughout the year, and achieved her highest year-end ranking to date, of 249 in singles.
2013.
Tara started 2013 well, winning the $10K ITF women's singles titles in Glasgow and Preston in the UK, and following that with the $25K ITF women's title in Surprise, Arizona, USA. In partnership with compatriot Melanie South, Tara also won the doubles titles in Glasgow and in the ITF women's $25K in Rancho Mirage, California, USA, and was runner up in Preston and in Phuket, Thailand.
Tara debuted in the top 200 in the singles rankings on 22 April and made the cut for the Roland Garros qualifying tournament, her first Grand Slam outside of Wimbledon, where she has played qualifiers courtesy of wildcards. There she lost to seventh seed Sesil Karatancheva in the first round of qualifying.
On grass, in the UK, Tara was awarded a wildcard into the $75K ITF women's Aegon Trophy in Nottingham. She reached the second round, beating 143-ranked Slovenian, Tadeja Majeric before falling to 110-ranked Hungarian, Melinda Czink. She then received a wildcard into the WTA Aegon Classic at Edgbaston where she narrowly lost to 12th seeded Kristina Mladenovic 7–5 6–7 4–6 in the first round. This followed with a wildcard into Wimbledon in June, where she faced 46-ranked Estonian, Kaia Kanepi, in the first round. Kanepi went on to win 7–5 5–7 7–5.
Back on the ITF women's circuit, Tara reached the finals of both the singles and the doubles tournamant of the $25K Woking tournament on outdoor hardcourt. She lost the singles final to Pemra Özgen of Turkey, 6–3 5–7 6–7(10), having held matchpoints. However, she and her Russian partner, Marta Sirotkina, won the doubles, beating the Japanese partnership of Mari Tanaka and Kanae Hisami in the final.
2014.
In 2014 Tara made her debut for the British Fed Cup team and won in her first singles rubber in the 9th/10th placed playoff against Austria. She impressively saw off Tamira Paszek - a former top 30 player - 6-2 6-4.

Zipp 2001

Zipp 2001 and 3001 were a line of bicycle frames, now discontinued, made by the Zipp company. Though they have been out of production for 7 years, they are still considered one of the fastest time trial frames ever made , and still have a cult following within triathlon, where they remain race-legal .
Theory.
The mid-1990s were a fertile time for bicycle designers. New materials (aluminum, carbon fiber) created a lot of new possibilities beyond the "double triangle" design of bicycle frames that had dominated the market. While steel was strong, it needed to be reinforced geometrically in order for thin tubes to be used; large, unsupported beams were impossible unless designers were willing to add pounds and pounds of steel to hold them up. But with aluminum and carbon fiber, newer, more creative designs became possible.
During the late 1990s, a number of "non-traditional" designs launched onto the market. While the Zipp 2001 may be one of the better known products, other frames made in this era included Hotta, Softride, Trek's Y-foil, and the Cheetah Cat.
Timeline.
The frame that was to become the 2001 was first shown in prototype form in 1990, finalized in 1991, and entered production in 1992. The Zipp 3001 (which was a 2001 with additional boron strips stiffening the carbon fiber) was offered in 1997. 1998, the UCI announced that all non-double diamond frames would be illegal for road racing starting in January 2000. This led Zipp to discontinue production at the end of 1997.
The existing component inventory was sold to one of the men who had worked on frame production, and the frames have not been produced since that time.
Successes of the Frame.
While it was in production, it was widely regarded one of, if not the fastest bicycle frame in production . "Project 96", an attempt to create a US-only superbike for the '96 Olympics, fell into disarray when the data suggested that rather than building a new prototype then in tests, they should instead simply use Zipps rebadged as "US bicycles" .
Interestingly, despite 7 years of development after Zipps were shut down, it still seems that there are few or no frames as fast as a Zipp .
Current status.
Since January 2000, Zipps have not been legal for use in road racing or UCI organized time trials. They are, however, legal in triathlon, which has much more liberal equipment rules. Despite the fact that they have been out of production for 10 years, the frames still have a cult following within triathlon. While they are known for being flexible, and therefore not well suited to hillclimbing, they are well suited to flatter courses.

Vermilion Point

Vermilion Point is a remote, undeveloped shore in Chippewa County, Michigan, United States. Located west of Whitefish Point, Michigan, this historic spot lies on a stretch of Lake Superior’s southeast coast known as the "Graveyard of the Great Lakes" or the "Shipwreck Coast". The servicemen of Vermilion Lifesaving Station performed daring rescues of shipwrecks from 1877 until 1944 when it was closed after modern navigational technology made this service obsolete.
Vermilion Point was a popular stopover for Native Americans, early travelers, and explorers. Early settlers used its bogs and marshes to grow cranberries that were shipped to Chicago, Illinois and Duluth, Minnesota. Today it is protected as a nature preserve for study of avian ecology and research of the Piping Plover and beach plant community succession.
Ecology.
Its sand and pebble beach is intermingled with agates that are churned ashore during storms. Pounding surf and buffeting winds keep the low barrier dune paralleling the beach sparsely vegetated. Water filled swales, bogs, and marshes occupy the land behind the barrier dune.
Vermilion Point no longer exists as a peninsula. Sand Creek flowing out of the surrounding wetlands into Lake Superior is the only remaining geographical landmark for Vermilion The original forest cover was lumbered off and is now replaced with typical northern hardwoods and conifers.
Shiras Expeditions.
In the early 20th century the University of Michigan conducted, over several years, a comprehensive series of ecological investigations in the Whitefish Point-Vermillion region, supported by George Shiras. Subjects included botany; ichthyology; ornithology; herpetology; and others, and provide nearly 100 years later a valuable set of baseline data for conditions at the time. The report of the flora, for example, includes in addition to a list of plants found and their habitats and locations, many photographs of the area around the Vermillion Station and the nearby wetlands. Many of the results were published under the general title "Results of the Shiras Expeditions to the Whitefish Point Region, Michigan", most by the University of Michigan (Occasional Papers series of several of the museums), the Reports of the Michigan Academy of Science, or the Michigan Geological and Biological Survey.
Early history.
Vermilion was named for the nearby vermilion deposits used by the Native Americans for paint. There is no evidence that Native Americans permanently settled at Vermilion but it was a popular stopover for Native Americans, Voyageurs, Coureur des bois, trappers, and anyone who traveled the south shore of Lake Superior. Jesuit missionaries were probably the first Europeans to stop at Vermilion in the 17th century. Territorial governor Lewis Cass and geologist and Indian Agent Henry Schoolcraft passed through Vermilion Point with a party of 44 in 1820 on an official expedition along the south shore of Lake Superior. Henry Schoolcraft took overnight shelter from a storm at Vermilion in 1831 when leading a party to vaccinate Native Americans.
Life Saving Service.
The Vermilion Lifesaving Station began operation in 1877 on the Lake Superior coast known as the “Graveyard of the Great Lakes”or, the "Shipwreck Coast". Shipwrecks along this coast dramatically increased after the Soo Locks opened this coastline to shipping in 1855. During this time, the United States Life-Saving Service established three other sister life saving stations between Munising and Whitefish Point, Michigan at Crisp Point Light, Deer Park, and Two Hearted River. Vermilion is the only site of the four life saving stations that still has remaining historical structures.
Servicemen considered duty at the Vermilion Live Saving Station so hard and desolate that some called it the “Alcatraz” of the U.S. Life-Saving Service. Life for the men and their families was isolated and monotonous except during dangerous, dramatic rescue operations in boiling seas. For many years there were few roads and supplies were delivered by boat. During the snowbound winter months in the 1930s, they received their mail by dog sled.
The Vermilion surfmen’s rigorous training and drills with self-bailing and self-righting lifeboats in rolling seas made them so skillful that the United States Life Saving Service chose them to demonstrate their life saving at the St. Louis World Fair in 1904.
The United States Life-Saving Service was merged with U.S. Coast Guard in 1915. The advent of bigger and better diesel freighters, better weather forecasting, and improved radio communication and navigational instruments such as radar greatly increased the safety of sailing. Following World War II, the Coast Guard found that the life saving stations were no longing serving a useful purpose. The Vermilion Life Saving Station was first merged with the Crisp Point Lifesaving Station as an unmanned sub-station in 1940, and then closed in 1944.
Cranberry operation.
The low bog lands and surrounding wetlands, small lakes, ponds, and Sand Creek made Vermilion Point ideally suited for cranberry cultivation. By dividing the bogs with earthen walls and damming Sand Creek, workers harvested the cranberries by combing the vines with narrow-tined forks and floating the ripe, buoyant cranberries that were gathered with wide bottomed scoops. The cranberries were transported by flat bottomed boat to a large water wheel on Sand Creek that scooped up them up from a trough and dumped them on a conveyor belt to a mill. After the cranberries were sorted and crated for shipping or processed into cats-up or jelly, they were loaded onto small trolley cars, and hauled down a tramway to Lake Superior where they were loaded onto small boats and then transferred to a steamer waiting offshore. The cranberries were shipped to Chicago, Duluth, and other places on the waterways.
The cranberry operation at Vermilion Point lasted from 1887 to 1932 with the greatest production years occurring between 1888 and 1910. Vermilion Point produced 1,600 bushels of cranberries in 1897. Today the earthen walls still exist but the marshes are flooded by beaver dams on the channels. Cranberries can still be found along the edges of the marshes and wet beach areas.
Hard times.
When the Coast Guard closed the station, local residents vandalized the original equipment that dated back to 1876 that the Coast Guard left behind. The station was sold to private owners in 1947 for the sum of $17,000. It was reported that motorcycle gangs frequented the station in the 1950s and “hippies” took up summer residence in the 1960s. Four-wheel drive vehicles and snowmobiles destroyed much of the beach grass surrounding the old station in the 1970s.
Vermilion today.
In early 1970s the Vermilion Life Saving Station and the surrounding undeveloped shoreline was privately purchased for preservation and restoration. Vermilion Point is one of the few Great Lakes sites where the Piping Plover has successfully nested. By 2004 it was transferred to the Little Traverse Conservancy as the Vermilion Point Nature Preserve that is used by the Lake Superior State University, the Whitefish Point Bird Observatory, and the Michigan Audubon Society for research of the federally endangered Piping Plover and beach plant community succession as well as student hands-on experience in avian ecology. The property is open to the public for quiet recreation – no motorized vehicle is allowed on the preserve and the areas around piping plover nests and bird-trapping nets are restricted.

Conditions (Russia)

The Conditions (, Konditsii) were an 18th-century constitutional project in Russia, signed by Empress Anna of Russia in Mitau on 18 January 1730, giving substantial power to the Supreme Privy Council. When the Empress returned to Russia, she revoked her approval of the Conditions and dissolved the Supreme Privy Council on the 20th of February. The members of the Council were removed from government and exiled or repressed paving the way for Anna to become an absolute monarch in the model of her uncle Peter the Great.
The Conditions acted as a constitution binding the monarch in relation to:
None of these powers could be exercised by the monarch, under the Conditions, without the approval of the Supreme Privy Council. Or else they would face the possibility of deposition.

Gardens of Vatican City

The Vatican Gardens () in Vatican City are urban gardens and parks which cover more than half of the Vatican territory in the South and Northeast. There are some buildings, such as Radio Vatican, within the gardens.
The gardens cover approximately which is most of the Vatican Hill. The highest point is above mean sea level. Stone walls bound the area in the North, South and West.
The gardens and parks were established during the Renaissance and Baroque era and are decorated with fountains and sculptures. There are several springs under the earth which as of 2009 are not in use. There is a wide variety of flora, and the area is considered a biotope.
There is no general public access, but guided tours are available to limited numbers.
History.
Tradition says that the site of the Vatican Gardens was spread with earth brought from Golgotha by Saint Helena to symbolically unite the blood of Christ with that shed by thousands of early Christians, who died in the persecutions of Nero. The gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal Apostolic Palace. In 1279, Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, 1277–1280) moved his residence back to the Vatican from the Lateran Palace and enclosed this area with walls. He planted an orchard "(pomerium)", a lawn "(pratellum)" and a garden "(viridarium)".
The site received a major re-landscaping at the beginning of the 16th century, during the papacy of Julius II. Donato Bramante's original design was then split into three new courtyards, the "Cortili del Belvedere", the ""della Biblioteca"" and the ""della Pigna"" (or "Pine Cone") in the Renaissance landscape design style. Also in Renaissance style, a great rectangular Labyrinth, formal in design, set in boxwood and framed with Italian stone pines, "(Pinus pinea)" and cedars of Lebanon, "(Cedrus libani)". In place of Nicholas III's enclosure, Bramante built a great rectilinear defensive wall.
Today's Vatican Gardens are spread over nearly , they contain a variety of medieval fortifications, buildings and monuments from the 9th century to the present day, set among vibrant flower beds and topiary, green lawns and a patch of forest. There are a variety of fountains cooling the gardens, sculptures, an artificial grotto devoted to Our Lady of Lourdes, and an olive tree donated by the government of Israel.

Rugby career.
Rees joined Newport in 1934 after joining Newport Police Force. In 1935 he was part of the Newport team that faced the touring New Zealand team. Newport lost the game 17-5 in a game noted for its physicality in the scrum and during rucks. Rees was also chosen to represent Wales against the same touring New Zealand team, but earlier in the year had already gained his first Welsh cap when he was selected to face both Scotland and Ireland in the Home Nations Championship.
Rees' first international match was against Scotland under the captaincy of Claude Davey. Wales won the game 10-6, mainly thanks to an impressive display from Cliff Jones. His second international, at Ravenhill in Belfast, saw Wales lose to Ireland, the eventual tournament winners. His next international game was against the New Zealand tourists in a close game which Wales won in the last few minutes. In 1936 Rees played in all three games of the Home Nations Championship which Wales won after beating Scotland and Ireland and drawing with England. Rees played in the first two games of the 1937 Championship, with his final game being against Scotland at St Helens.
In 1938 Rees was approached to play for the British Lions in their 1938 tour of South Africa, but turned them down for financial reasons.

Windows Azure

Windows Azure is a cloud computing platform and infrastructure, created by Microsoft, for building, deploying and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. It provides both PaaS and IaaS services and supports many different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems. Windows Azure was released on February 1, 2010.
Features.
Windows Azure is Microsoft's cloud application platform.
In June 2012, Windows Azure released the following new features:
The Windows Azure Platform provides an API built on REST, HTTP, and XML that allows a developer to interact with the services provided by Windows Azure. Microsoft also provides a client-side managed class library which encapsulates the functions of interacting with the services. It also integrates with Microsoft Visual Studio, Git, and Eclipse.
Microsoft released a set of infographics. One poster summarizes [http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/infographics/windows-azure/] Windows Azure and the features in it. A downloadable PDF version also exists.
Implementation.
Windows Azure uses a specialized operating system, called Windows Azure, to run its "fabric layer" — a cluster hosted at Microsoft's datacenters that manages computing and storage resources of the computers and provisions the resources (or a subset of them) to applications running on top of Windows Azure. Windows Azure has been described as a "cloud layer" on top of a number of Windows Server systems, which use Windows Server 2008 and a customized version of Hyper-V, known as the Windows Azure Hypervisor to provide virtualization of services.
Scaling and reliability are controlled by the Windows Azure Fabric Controller so the services and environment do not crash if one of the servers crashes within the Microsoft datacenter and provides the management of the user's web application like memory resources and load balancing.

Datacenter.
Some datacenters have servers grouped inside containers - each containing 1800-2500 servers.
The locations of the data centers are:
The CDN nodes are located in 24 countries.
Deployment in Ireland.
As of July 2010, Microsoft had completed 6,000 installations of Azure in Ireland. Executives at Microsoft hoped that this figure would rise to 100,000 installations by 2011.
Construction of the $500 million facility required 1 million man-hours of work with a peak workforce of around 2,100 workers. The facility, which began operating on July 1, 2009, currently covers 303,000 square feet (2.815 hectares), with 5.4 megawatts of critical power available. Over time, the data center can expand to a total of 22.2 mega watts of critical power to support future growth.
Privacy.
Microsoft has stated that, per the USA Patriot Act, the US government can have access to the data even if the hosted company is not American and the data resides outside the USA. However, Windows Azure is compliant with the E.U. Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC). To manage Privacy and Security related concerns, Microsoft has created a Windows Azure Trust Center, and Windows Azure has several of its services compliant with several compliance programs including and HIPAA. A full and current listing can be found on the Windows Azure Trust Center Compliance page.
Significant outages.
Windows Azure outages and service disruptions have occurred from time to time. Some have been system-wide with potentially significant harm.

Juan Nepomucino Goetz

Juan Nepomucino Goetz () was a Austrian Catholic priest whose arrival in Cuba led to two extraordinary controversies.
Goetz became Professor of Philosophy and Morality at the Imperial and Royal University of Vienna, and then, desiring to travel, was appointed music chaplain of the Cathedral of Santo Domingo in Hispaniola (Dominican Republic). Later, as priest and rector, he moves to San Fernando de Monte Cristi, and then to the wealthy parish of Môle Saint-Nicolas in Haiti. There he witnessed the slave uprising and the occupation of his parish by the British. When Toussaint-Louverture drives out the British he rings the church bells and celebrates. But, all too soon! War flares up throughout the country, voodoo drums throb through the night, and white faces are none too popular. Deprived of alms and suffering from yellow fever, Goetz flees to Santiago de Cuba, where his knowledge of languages gives him a place as the 'foreigners' priest.
Goetz in Santiago de Cuba.
When Esteban Salas y Castro, choirmaster in the Cathedral of Santiago de Cuba, died in 1803, the election of the new Maestro de Capilla was an extraordinary event. It had been a foregone conclusion that Francisco José Hierrezuelo, long-time assistant of Salas, would be elected. Came the day, and Hierrezuelo spotted a certain well-qualified German priest in the choir. Blind with rage, and fearing the bishop had planned a conspiracy to thwart him, Hierrezuelo refused to take the examination, picked up his pen and wrote infuriated letters. The bishop persuaded the German, none other than Goetz, to renounce his candidacy, but Hierrezuelo had so offended the bishop and the town council by his irate letters that, despite grovelling apologies, he got only a minor position in the chapel. He was never to become maestro. The competent and hard-working Juan París was appointed, and Goetz moved on to Havana, where his arrival also had remarkable consequences.
Goetz in Havana.
In Havana at the same time, the choirmaster, Lazo de la Vega, was ailing, and died. Upon his death four men sought the post: 28 year-old first violinist José Francisco Rensoli, singer Luis Lazo, maestro Cayetano Solis and the Catalan Cayetano Pagueras, a religious composer and first contralto. The matter was to be decided by competitive examination. Pagueras was a strong candidate, regarding himself as a maestro in four arts: plainsong, organ playing, counterpoint and composition.
All were set for the examination when a letter, written on 29 July 1803, arrived at the cathedral. It was from Goetz, offering his service. Great was the consternation amongst the rivals when they discovered that the town council had invited Goetz to Havana so they could learn more about his merits.
Goetz arrived in Havana at the beginning of November 1803, having applied for naturalization as a Spanish subject. Later that month, the town council, duly impressed with his competence, appointed him interim holder of the desired position. Pagueras and Rensoli set out to make his work as difficult as possible. "When Goetz appeared before the choir, he was surrounded by pale, half-scared smiles" (Carpentier, p136). After looking, listening and questioning, he wrote a first report to the town council full of acute assessments of key members of the choir:
As a good musician preferring quality of sound to quantity, he reduced the number of positions, moved good young singers up in status, and recommended that any reduced in rank should retake the exam, both theoretical and practical. In 1806, under his plan, the singers and musicians were: choirmaster, four sopranos, two contraltos, two tenors, a baritone; two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, four violins, bass viol, and bass.

Scene7

Scene7 is an American on-demand rich media software company that provides document hosting and interactive publishing services such as online catalogs, targeted email, video, and image management. Several companies, mostly retailers, use the company's services to showcase products on their websites and to allow customers to interact with the products. Scene7's technology allows users to manipulate product images by zooming in and rotating products, simulating the inspection of merchandise in retail stores.
The company, founded as a division of Autodesk, created a room decoration computer software called Picture This Home in the mid-1990s. The division was sold to Broderbund in 1998, then spun off as a company called GoodHome.com in June 1999, receiving $30 million in venture capital. After GoodHome.com failed to become profitable, it was reorganized and renamed Scene7. It formally launched on January 23, 2001 and focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Scene7 was acquired by Adobe Systems on May 31, 2007 for an undisclosed sum.
Company.
A subsidiary of Adobe Systems, Scene7 provides document hosting and interactive publishing services, typically charging clients $30,000 to $50,000 a year to convert catalog print files to interactive web pages. The company does most of its business in North America. Its primary competitors for dynamic imaging services and technology are RichFX and LiquidPixels. Scene7 products rely on several Adobe products, including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Flash, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Flex; this relationship existed before Adobe purchased the company. Scene7 does not maintain any servers to host its services; instead, it uses a "pay as you grow" program that only requires it to pay for the resources that it uses.
Scene7's clients include the companies Sears, Lands' End, Harrods, Macy's, Office Depot, Levi Strauss & Co., La-Z-Boy, and QVC. In 2001, Scene7 agreed to develop home design and landscaping software for Individual Software for $50 million. High-end casual clothing retailer Anthropologie has used Scene7's services to create and deploy online catalogs for its e-commerce website since November 9, 2004. The retailer implemented Scene7's Dynamic Imaging service to let customers zoom in on products, similar to how merchandise is inspected in retail stores. The Harrods department store signed an agreement with Scene7 on June 24, 2005 to use Scene7's imaging and catalog system on the store's website. This required Harrods to convert all its printed material to a digital format for Internet use.
On October 20, 2005, web agency Logan Tod announced that it had partnered with Scene7 to offer new features on its e-commerce websites. These include Scene7's Dynamic Imaging service, which allows visitors to zoom in on products to see details; this feature, Logan Tod claimed, helps to drive purchase decisions. Fathead, a company that builds and sells wall graphics, uses Scene7's services on its website to generate images and to allow visitors to layer images on top of each other dynamically. National Business Furniture, a furniture retailer based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, implemented Scene7's technology on November 3, 2008, allowing visitors to dynamically change the colors of product images on the company's website.
History.
GoodHome.com.
The company began as a development team that created software called Picture This Home in the mid-1990s for Autodesk in San Rafael, California. The program allowed people to virtually preview room decoration projects before any work began. Its users can create virtual rooms, change walls and arrange furniture, and create photo-realistic renderings of completed designs. Picture This Home was awarded the "Good Housekeeping" Seal of Approval. In 1998, the software and its team of 40 developers were sold to Broderbund, which was owned by The Learning Company, a subsidiary of Mattel Inc. Broderbund eventually spun Picture This Home off as a company called GoodHome.com in June 1999 with Doug Mack as its CEO. The company received $30 million in venture capital from Hearst Interactive Media.
Mack noted that before Broderbund spun off GoodHome.com as a separate company, there was a "big culture clash" between the established company and the new media division. He said that companies such as Broderbund were so concerned with established business that smaller, newer divisions found it hard to receive sufficient attention and bandwidth. He praised Broderbund's decision to spin the company off as a separate entity: "We would have never been able to build our Web business if we were not in a separate building with separate funding." Mack observed that newer companies like GoodHome.com rarely had any problem in hiring new employees because of the opportunity for Internet companies to grow quickly into "the next Amazon.com".
In September 1999, GoodHome.com merged with Alexandria, Virginia-based nHabit.com, a rival company, for an undisclosed sum. After the merger, GoodHome.com was assured that it would grow quickly; the merger also added the Internet service provider America Online to GoodHome.com's portfolio as a client. Ten weeks after forming a business plan, GoodHome.com officially launched on September 29, 1999 with offices in San Rafael and New York City, New York, and Roger Horchow was assigned as its chairman. The company used the slogan "A beautiful home. It was never this easy," and focused on selling furniture and other home items, spending $20 million on advertisements in its first year. Mack decided that the company should target women, since "women make 80 percent of decorating decisions." The company built a home furnishings portal to compete with the websites Living.com and Furniture.com, which both went bankrupt in 2000. In April 2000, GoodHome.com's monthly sales topped $1 million; the company's goal was to be profitable within two to three years.
One of the website's biggest attractions was its virtual decorating service that let customers see how certain features such as the paint, upholstery fabric, rugs, and pillows would look before a purchase. When considering why this service was so popular, Mack noted that consumers usually feel more confident in a purchase when there are few unknowns. At the time, selling products over the Internet was not a popular concept outside the United States, but Mack was confident in expanding GoodHome.com's portfolio to include foreign companies: "We're already getting so many requests from companies about expanding our website abroad. [...] I see this happening quickly within the next few years."
GoodHome.com encountered difficulties in running its business in 2000, when several other companies that offered similar services launched. The increasing demand for online catalog services, considered a phenomenon, was dubbed the "hottest thing since sliced bread" by an analyst from technology research firm Forrester Research, which estimated that roughly $500 million was invested in home furnishing websites from 1999 to 2000. It became difficult for consumers to decide which service provided better quality; a business owner commented, "You can't tell the difference in quality between something that's $3,000 and something that's $10,000." GoodHome.com, which had offered free shipping, phased out the feature on July 15, 2000, in favor of "heavily subsidized rates". To compete with new companies, GoodHome.com also introduced new features such as a "floor planning" feature to allow website visitors build an electronic version of their rooms, then drag in furnishings to see how they fit.
Reorganization.
After spending several years operating at a loss, GoodHome.com reorganized as Scene7, which formally launched on January 23, 2001, with $15 million raised from investors that included Hearst Interactive Media. The new company focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Mack, the Broderbund executive who had decided to spin off the company, reflected on the decision to reorganize and relaunch: "We got a year into initial GoodHome scheme and the whole B2C (business-to-consumer) market tanked, and we realized we could not build a successful business as a portal [...] But the whole time we kept having people approach us to license the technology create virtual catalogs, and finally a light bulb went off when we realized we were sitting on top of a great technology we could sell." Scene7 raised a round of financing on July 12, 2001 that totaled $11.3 million, which helped stabilize the company. The deal was led by venture capitalists from several firms, including Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management and Xcelera of the Cayman Islands, with cash investments from Cooley Godward and Perkins Coie. After the latest round of financing, Mack planned for Scene7 to have 15 clients and a burn rate, or negative cash flow, of less than $700,000 a month, stating, "What we learned was to stick to your strategy, and don't get nervous when the competition is adopting a strategy to spend their way to victory." At the time, the company's revenues were well below its peak of $1 million a month, but Mack intended to increase revenues past that point in a few months.
Scene7 moved from San Rafael to Hamilton Landing in Novato, California in September 2002 to accommodate more employees. On July 9, 2003, the company acquired all of the assets of workflow provider and advertising software company Engage for $1.2 million and assumed its $650,000 debt after Engage filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Engage was the parent company of both Cascade and MidSystems, which were two of the first companies that tried to automate prepress production for newspapers and large printers. On August 15, 2003, Scene7 acquired its top competitor, TrueSpectra of San Mateo, for an undisclosed amount of cash and stock. On June 15, 2004, Scene7 raised $7.5 million in another round of financing, led by home shopping company QVC with some of Scene7's existing investors. At the same time, Jeffrey Branman, President of Interactive Technology Partners at QVC, and David Rubenstein, co-founder of the private equity firm The Carlyle Group, joined Scene7's board of directors, which was composed of James Caccavo of Moore Capital, Andrew Wright of RealNetworks, and Mack.
Since the early 2000s, the company's growth has been fueled by an increase in broadband Internet access, which loads virtual catalogs faster than dial-up Internet access. When catalogs first appeared online in the late 1990s, the graphics took too long to load. After high-speed Internet access became more popular, virtual catalogs quickly grew to become a popular feature of online stores. In addition to faster Internet connectivity, a study in 2000 noted that an online presence for brick and mortar businesses increased offline sales by an average of 27%. Mack also pointed out that having more product information disseminated helps play a role in increasing sales: "We have the ability to provide consistent information. [...] One of the advantages of selling furniture online is the hyperscript; you always have the original specifications on a product."
Acquisition.
Scene7 was acquired by Adobe Systems on May 31, 2007 for an undisclosed sum. At that time, Scene7 had 80 employees, most of whom were transferred from Scene7's former headquarters in Novato, California to Adobe's offices in San Francisco, California. Mack joined Adobe as its vice president of Creative Solutions Services. Scene7 was added to Adobe's product line as a hosted service to help boost Adobe's overall services strategy, especially its software as a service efforts, and because Scene7 was a great fit due to its heavy usage of Adobe products.
Adobe plans to integrate Scene7's products into Adobe LiveCycle, the company's suite of server software products, at an unspecified time. The Scene7 brand will continue to be used, but it will "eventually be replaced with the Adobe brand". Denmark-based YaWah, a dynamic imaging software company, was acquired by Adobe on September 26, 2008 to help expand Scene7 globally.

Henry Golden Dearth

Henry Golden Dearth (22 April 1864 – 27 March 1918) was a distinguished American painter who studied in Paris and continued to spend his summers in France painting in the Normandy region. He would return to New York in winter, and became known for his moody paintings of the Long Island area. Around 1912, Dearth changed his artistic style, and began to include portrait and still life pieces as well as his paintings of rock pools created mainly in Brittany. A winner of several career medals and the Webb prize in 1893, Dearth died suddenly in 1918 aged 53 and was survived by a wife and daughter.
Early life.
Born on April 22, 1864 in Bristol, Rhode Island, Henry Golden Dearth was the youngest of five children of John Willis and Ruth Marshall Dearth. His father was connected with the whaling business and was an artillery officer during the civil war. He was also a talented musician and provided favorable influences to the development of Henry's talent. His grandfather was a commander in the United States Navy during the war of 1812. At the age of 15, his family moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, where he entered the employ of Brown & Brothers, and was afterward for a time connected with the Waterbury Clock company. Dearth's passionate love for art led him to eventually devote himself solely to the study of painting. He entered the studio of portrait painter Horace Johnson for three months before he went to Paris and studied in the atelier of Ernest Hébert and Aimé Morot at L’Ecole des Beaux Arts.
Returning to the United States in 1888, Dearth established himself with a debut exhibition of landscape at the National Academy of Design. In 1889 he exhibited for the first time with the more progressive Society of American Artists. In 1893 he was awarded the Webb prize for works by an artist under the age of 40. In 1902 he opened his studio at 18 E. 40th Street in New York and started to return to spend his summers in Normandy, the region that first attracted him to landscape painting. He had a house and studio at Montreuil-sur-Mer, in the Pas-de-Calais, on the English Channel coast, where he worked several months each season. He married Cornelia Van Rensselaer Vail on 26 February 1896 and they had one daughter Nina Van Rensselaer Dearth.
Careers.
Dearth's career can be divided into two periods. Before 1912, he was a tonalism painter and is considered part of the American Barbizon school. Spending most of his time in France, he was naturally fond of the picturesque country, and many of his subjects were found near Boulogne and Montreuil-sur-Mer. These early works show a marked indifference to detail, a somewhat limited palette and a preference for a low key. In art critic Charles Buchanan's words, Dearth was more or less repainting Barbizon, but was "inexpressively exquisite" and "a supreme gentleman of aethetics". 
After 1912, he altered his technique and painted with broken colors, changing his subjects from the moody landscapes of Long Island and Montreuil to still life and figurative subjects in a style reminiscent of Adolphe Monticelli. Such a style change was marked by his request to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1915 to replace his earlier work with his recent figure painting. Although his late works include portraits and genre subject, his most numerous works of this period were paintings of rock pools in Brittany. The canvases were highly colored; the pigment thickly applied with impressive decorative effect of the compositions. In his final days, Dearth frequently used objects from his substantial collection of Gothic, Renaissance, and Eastern artifacts as his subjects or as backgrounds. His final pictures incorporated important Japanese screens, early Chinese paintings, and stone carvings of the Wei period in still life arrangements or as backgrounds for some finely modeled figures.
Death, reception and posthumous fame.
Henry Golden Dearth died of a heart attack on March 27, 1918 at his home at 116 E. 63 Street, New York city. 
Dearth's works from the 1890s to the early 1900s show him to be the landscape painter of considerable delicacy, refinement, and imaginative feeling. Paintings such as Springtme Montigny (1899) and Montigny (1898) exemplify his conscientious regard for the facts of nature, combined with a notable faculty for their poetic interpretation in artistic terms. His pictures are full of light and atmosphere, and no matter how brilliant his color schemes, the result is a subtle depth of tone instead of hardness. When Boulogne Harbor was exchanged for Cornelia in Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Times critic commented the two pictures seen together would have formed an extraordinary commentary on the completeness and rapidity of a style change possible to an impressionable painter. In the works dating from 1912 and beyond, he freely used pure color spots and splashes in order to render what he saw so that the paintings display great harmony and are pervaded with a rich, unctuous feeling. 
After his death, a memorial exhibition was organized by Mrs. Henry Golden Dearth and Cornelia B. Sage-Quninton, Director of the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy and Albright Art Gallery in the principal museums or art galleries in the cities of Buffalo, New York, Detroit, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Muskegon, Youngstown, Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Des Moines, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, Worcester, Providence and Boston in 1919.
Affiliations and awards.
Dearth became a member of the Society of American Artists in 1888 and was elected to full Academician in 1906 when the National Academy and the Society merged. He was also a member of the Fencers Club, Lotos Club, and the Century Association. He won the Society of American Artists' Webb prize in 1893. He also won a bronze medal at the Exposition Universal in Paris (1900) and silver medals at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo (1901) and at an exhibition in Buenos Aires (1907).

DJ Q

DJ Q is a Huddersfield born DJ. Teamed with MC Bonez, he is known for his commercial single, "You Wot!".
Early life.
DJ Q’s musical journey started from a young age in Huddersfield, listening to music played by his parents. It was at the age of 12 when 'Q' first got involved with the UK Garage scene, buying vinyls and tape packs. When his vinyl collection grew larger Q finally got a pair of record decks in his bedroom. After teaching himself to mix Q started to get bookings at local parties at the age of 15, before learning to produce music the next year at college.
Career.
Q's break on radio came in 2004, when a friend working at BBC Radio 1Xtra informed him that the station were looking for a new DJ on the pulse of the rising Bassline scene in the North of England. He submitted a mix CD, and before long Q became the youngest DJ at 1Xtra, hosting the fortnightly UKG Mix Show. 
It was around the same time Q released his first vinyl, 'Love Like This (The Reasons)' which was a big hit on the Bassline scene. This brought him more bookings at Bassline events and as time passed Q produced more hits such as 'Tea Bag', 'Dirty' and later 'You Wot!', which was signed and released via Ministry of Sound. The popular ‘You Wot!’ made the UK Top 50 upon its release in summer 2008, which led to remix work for the likes of Amy Winehouse, Dizzee Rascal, Keri Hilson and Katy B to name a few.
Q continued to host his 1Xtra show – by now a weekly broadcast - throughout his mainstream success, and frequently appeared on sister station BBC Radio 1 for guest mixes, before his departure in 2012 after 8 years at the station. He soon began a new monthly show on Ministry of Sound Radio, presenting the Essential Garage show.
Recent years have seen an increase in new productions from Q, with over 10 digital single and EP releases since 2012 that cross a broad spectrum of dance music. These include ‘Say To You’ (released under the alias Classified), the ‘Sound Boy Connection’ EP via US label Party Like Us, and three singles from his upcoming debut album via Local Action Records.
During his decade in the music industry, Q has also played music in countries across the globe and Europe particularly, with sets in the likes of Ibiza, Amsterdam, Italy, Russia, and America.

Philipp Agricola

Philipp Agricola (fl. 1571–1594) was a German poet and dramatist.
Agricola was born in Eisleben, and is assumed to have been the son of Johannes Agricola. He was in Berlin by 1571, where he wrote poetry and dramas about Brandenburg's ruling family; his drama "Jüngste Gericht" (1573) satirized the Junkers and court clergy. He was active in Berlin until at least 1594.

Thoracic aorta injury

Injury of the thoracic aorta refers to any injury which affects the portion of the aorta which lies within the chest cavity. Injuries of the thoracic aorta are usually the result of physical trauma; however, they can also be the result of a pathological process. The main causes of damage are deceleration and crush injuries.
Classification.
There are inconsistencies in the terminology of aortic injury. There are several terms which are interchangeably used to describe injury to the aorta such as "tear", "laceration", "transection", and "rupture". "Laceration" is used as a term for the consequence of a tear, whereas a "transection" is a section across an axis or cross section. For all intents and purposes, the latter is used when a tear occurs across all or nearly all of the circumference of the aorta. "Rupture" is defined as a forcible disruption of tissue. Some disagree with the usage of "rupture" as they believe it implies that a tear is incompatible with life; however, the term accurately gauges the severity of tears in the aorta. A rupture can be either complete or partial, and can be classified further by the position of the tear.
Causes.
Injuries to the aorta are usually the result of trauma, such as deceleration and crush injuries. Deceleration injuries almost always occur during high speed impacts, such as those in motor vehicle crashes and falls from high heights. Several mechanical processes can occur and are reflected in the injury itself. A more recently proposed mechanism is that the aorta can be compressed between bony structures (such as the manubrium, clavicle, and first rib) and the spine. In the ascending aorta (the portion of the aorta which is almost vertical), one mechanism of injury is torsion (a two-way twisting).

Misafa Lesafa

Misafa Lesafa: From Language to Language is a 2004 Israeli documentary film that shares interviews with foreign-born Israeli artists and writers about the importance of language and asks how the struggle between their mother tongue and Hebrew has affected their art. The documentary shares interviews with some of Israel's more prominent thinkers and artists. The film won the Best Israeli Documentary award at the 2004 Docaviv Festival.
Plot.
"It is not a language that flows out of you", an immigrant writer says of Hebrew, which he first learned when he moved to Israel. "It's more like shoveling gravel out of your mouth."
Hebrew might be Israel's national language, but the nation has always had a large number of immigrants who arrive speaking their own native tongues. According to "Misafa Lesafa", these Israeli immigrants face a conflict between the reflexive language of their childhood and the new language that surrounds them, and no one feels this conflict more sharply than the artists whose passions rely on words.
Misafa Lesafa explores the inner workings of writers’ mind to reveal how each one handles their craft differently, and responds differently to the common linguistic conflict they face: How do you find your voice when two languages pull you in different directions? One Russian poet says he felt that being bilingual would threaten his writing because instead of using one language perfectly, he would rely on two watered-down, imperfect languages. He speaks violently when explaining how he had to force Russian out of his mind once he learned Hebrew. Although Russian words were eventually lost, he grew to realize that his poems borrowed their musical rhythm from Pushkin and Lermontov—the great Russian writers who had first impressed him.
Many of the poets share this intensity when they speak about language. One woman describes her relationship to her first language in terms of a primal, infantile love. Like a little girl crawling into her mother’s lap, she says, she sinks into her native tongue when she is emotionally strained. And when she hears it spoken, it feels like drinking motherly milk.

Strmol Castle

Strmol Castle (, ) is a castle located at the foot of "Dvorjanski hrib" ("Mansion Hill") near the villages of Češnjevek, Grad and Dvorje, in the municipality of Cerklje na Gorenjskem, Slovenia. Named after its builders, the Strmol family, it is notable as one of the few castles in Slovenia to retain a Slovene name throughout its history. It is currently a guesthouse and conference site for the government of the Republic of Slovenia.
History.
Of the twelve medieval manors in the area of the modern municipality of Cerklje, Strmol Castle is the only one that has survived intact to the present. The castle is first mentioned in the 13th century, though there are no reliable records of its founding. The structure is centered on a towering keep with a late medieval core, taking its present form after renaissance and baroque renovations. The central keep is surrounded by a low, rectangular renaissance defensive wall, fortified with square corner turrets, which once featured a drawbridge over a moat. The interiors are richly furnished with historic furniture and art. 
In January 1944, the Partisans abducted and murdered the owners of the castle, Rado Hribar (1901–1944) and Ksenija Gorjup Hribar (1905–1944), in the forest at Mače. Their bodies were never found and the castle was confiscated by the communist government after the war. A demand for restitution of the property was lodged in 1992 and the castle was returned to the heirs in 2004.
Castle Parklands.
The castle is surrounded by a park, established in the late 17th century. It originally encompassed an orchard on the slope below the castle, and four fishponds on the plain below that, with a walking path with benches leading from the castle. The layout has not significantly changed, though only one of the ponds remains. The current arrangement includes an access path, which ascends the slope toward a square walled courtyard behind the castle. The wall is decorated with baroque female figures and puttos by Angelo PuttaPozzi, originally from the garden of the defunct Zalog (Wartenberg) manor by Moravče, but relocated here in the 1960s along with his Atlas statues at the northerm entrance steps. On the opposite side of the courtyard, the path descends toward a nearby road. Between the access paths there is an informal park, with an artificial lake and non-native trees.

V. Vivaudou

V. Vivaudou Inc., was an American perfume manufacturer and auto company which operated in New York City. V. Vivaudou Inc., was taken over by the United Drug Company in February 1916, for a price of $1,500,000. Among its perfume and cosmetics line, Mavis Talcum Vivaudou red tin was quite often part of the women's toiletries checklist. 
In August 1919 the United Drug Company sold V. Vivaudou Inc., to a syndicate of New York men for $2,500,000.
The business signed to carry out the sale and distribution of Alcorub on the Pacific Coast, in September 1922. In January 1926 the firm approved a contract to acquire the Alfred H. Smith Company. In May 1930 V. Vivaudou Inc., was ordered by the Federal Trade Commission to divest itself of capital stock in Parfumerie Melba, Inc., and the Alfred H. Smith Company. The FTC ruled that the companies were formerly competitors of V. Vivaudou Inc, and its acquisition of their stock constituted a monopoly.
The order to divest was reversed by a United States Court of Appeals in November 1931. The court decided that the three companies' control of 6% of the United States cosmetics market did not constitute a monopoly.
Business history.
Victor Vivaudou, the owner, was born in Cannes, France on January 2, 1881. He travelled to the US with his mistress Rosa on the Lusitania on September 12, 1914, setting up V. Vivaudou Inc. in the Times building in 1915. He and three other investors also founded Meridian Motors, a Manhattan autos and appurtenances company, which was chartered in January 1917. 
A new company was incorporated with V. Vivaudou as its president in September 1919. An underwriting syndicate was formed headed by J.S. Bache & Co. and S.M. Schatzkin. The underwriting syndicate was dissolved in mid-September 1919.
The corporation had an initial capital outlay of $12,000, and maintained its headquarters at the New York Times Building.
V. Vivaudou Inc., was listed on the New York Stock Exchange beginning on May 5, 1920. It issued 300,000 shares of capitol stock. Company stockholders approved an increase of common stock from 340,000 to 500,000 shares on January 5, 1926. The shares were changed from $10 to no par value. They agreed to an issuance of 25,000 shares of 7 per cent preferred stock with $100 par value. In November 1920 V. Vivaudou, Inc., reduced its dividend from .50 to .25 per share to conserve cash, in order to meet expansion in the United States and Europe. It reported earnings of $288,430 for the quarter ending on October 31,
1920. The sum translated to $4 per share prior to accounting for taxes.
Victor Vivaudou pleaded guilty to smuggling before a United States federal judge in New York City, on November 1, 1920. Vivaudou and Rosa failed to declare a $10,000 necklace and a $500 diamond ring, which they purchased in France, in March 1920. Vivaudou was fined $5,000.
In November 1921 the corporation reported a decline in earnings. Its gross profit of $1,153,185 was below that of the previous year's $2,031,861. Gross sales amounted to $4,100,124. V. Vivaudou, Inc., announced a 60% increase in sales in the first quarter of 1922. In August 1922 the firm stated that it had paid off the last of its bank loans and was debt free. Net profit for 1922 was $592,947, and approximately $770,000 for the first ten months of 1923. By mid 1924 V. Vivadou Inc., reported a sharp decline in profits, largely due to losses incurred by its French subsidiaries. Victor Vivaudou was ousted as President of V. Vivaudou Inc., by Jules Bache and David Schulte following disputes over conspiracy and fraudulent misrepresentation.
Vadsco subsidiary.
By 1943 V. Vivaudou of Canada and California was a subsidiary of Vadsco Sales Corporation. Vadsco expanded during World War II through the growth of Kny-Scheerer, a subsidiary which manufactured surgical instruments. Vadsco subsidiaries also produced perfumes, talcum and other products.

FBX

FBX ("Filmbox") is a proprietary file format (.fbx) developed by Kaydara and now owned by Autodesk. It is used to provide interoperability between digital content creation applications.
History.
FBX originated as a replacement file format for Kaydara's Filmbox software. Filmbox was an application for recording data from motion capture devices. Prior to 1996, Filmbox 1.0 used a file format called "FLM". The format only supported motion data, user preferences and a list of devices used in the capturing of the motion data. This data was a serialized version of the libraries (binary dump), containing read/write memory data. This method of storing data did not work well with different versions of the Filmbox software. There was also demand from early-adopters of Filmbox to implement a target character in a scene with the motion capture data, to enable the visualization of the data in a 3D view with display markers.
In 1996, Kaydara released a new native file format with Filmbox 1.5 called "FBX" (an abbreviation of "Filmbox"). The file format used an object-based model, allowing for the storing of motion data along with 2D, 3D, audio, and video data. The format saw wider support from other 3D software packages such as Maxon Cinema 4D, SoftImage 3D, Alias|Wavefront PowerAnimator, NewTek LightWave 3D, Kinetix 3D Studio MAX.
Filmbox was renamed MotionBuilder in 2002 with the release of version 4.0. In 2003, Kaydara launched FBX for Apple's QuickTime Viewer. Alias announced its intention to acquire Kaydara on August 8, 2004, reaching an agreement in September of the same year. A Software Development Kit was developed in 2005 to standardize the object model, and allow other software developers to provide plug-ins of their own. Alias was acquired by Autodesk on January 10, 2006. Later in 2006, support for properties was added to FBX.
Limitations.
Autodesk provides a C++ FBX SDK that can read, write, and convert to/from FBX files.
The FBX file format is proprietary, however, the format description is exposed in the FBX Extensions SDK which provides header files for the FBX readers and writers.
Currently there are two FBX SDK bindings: one for C++ and Python supplied by Autodesk. Blender includes a Python import and export script for FBX, written without using the FBX SDK and OpenEndedGroup's Field includes a Java based library for loading and extracting interesting parts from a FBX file.
FBX SDK is designed with interactive desktop applications in mind, and does not have much functionality useful in server (web, virtual worlds, etc.) applications. In particular, there is no support for data streaming - the whole scene has to be loaded together. Although, even with these limitations, FBX is popular as a supported import/export format for web-based 3D content creation tools such as Clara.io.
File format.
The FBX can be represented on-disk as either binary or ASCII data, the FBX SDK supports reading and writing both.
Neither of the formats are documented however the ASCII format is a tree structured document with clearly named identifiers.
While the binary representation is not documented there is an unofficial spec for the FBX binary file format, published by the Blender Foundation.

Grigol Mgaloblishvili

Grigol Mgaloblishvili (, ; born 7 October 1973) is a Georgian politician and diplomat who has been Georgia's Permanent Representative to NATO since 26 June 2009. He briefly served as the Prime Minister of Georgia from 1 November 2008 to 6 February 2009.
Early life and education.
Grigol Mgaloblishvili was born in Tbilisi, the capital of the then-Soviet Georgia, to the family of intelligentsiaHe graduated from Tbilisi State University, in 1995 with BA and MA degrees in Oriental Studies. Between 1992 and 1993, Mgaloblishvili spent a year at Istanbul University, obtaining a Certificate in Turkish Language. Mgaloblishvili's political career has been actively linked to the Republic of Turkey as he served as a Georgian diplomatic representative to the country from 1995 to 2002 on various positions, including as an interpreter, an attache, a First Secretary and a political counselor. Mgaloblishvili returned to Georgia, in 2003, to the position of the Deputy Director of the Department of USA, Canada and Latin American Countries at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia. Prior to this, between 2002 and 2003, Mgaloblishvili was enrolled on the UK postgraduate course in Diplomatic Studies at Oxford University. In 2004, Mgaloblishvili was promoted within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lead the Department of European Integration. In 2005 Grigol Mgaloblishvili was granted diplomatic rank of Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary and on 20 October 2006, that of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.. He served as the Georgian Ambassador to Turkey until 27 October 2008 when President Mikheil Saakashvili proposed him for the position of the Prime Minister of Georgia to the Parliament of Georgia. He speaks English, Turkish, Russian and German.
Prime minister.
Mgaloblishvili was approved as the Prime Minister on 1 November 2008. Mgaloblishvili implemented a minor reshuffle of the Cabinet, appointing Zurab Adeishvili as the Minister of Justice, Koba Subeliani as the Minister for Environment Protection and Grigol Vashadze was created the Minister of Culture and Cultural Heritage Preservation. Grigol Mgaloblishvili held his first public voyage on 3 November 2008, when he visited the Kakheti Region and conversed with the local agriculturers. The first sitting of Mgaloblishvili's new Cabinet took place on 5 November 2008. Further reshuffle in the cabinet was made on 8 December 2008, when the foreign, defense, and education ministers were replaced.
In late December 2008, Russian media widely picked up the report by Georgia's tabloid "Alia" claiming that an incident occurred between Mgaloblishvili and Saakashvili in which the latter allegedly punched Mgaloblishvili and threw a telephone into him. The story did not explain what provoked the president. Shortly afterwards, Mgaloblishvili left for Germany for medical examination. Returning to Georgia, responded to "hype and rumors" that was stirred by the press and described the Russian media reports as "ridiculous". President Saakashvili also responded to the rumors, saying that after Mgaloblishvili's return "Russian will calm down and focus more on global issues."
On 30 January 2009, during a press conference, Mgaloblishvili announced his resignation citing health problems and saying that he had suggested the President to consider nominating Nika Gilauri, the finance minister and first vice premier, for the prime minister's position.
Ambassador to NATO.
On 26 June 2009, Mgaloblishvili was approved by the Parliament of Georgia as the country's Permanent Representative to NATO, succeeding on this post Revaz Beshidze.

<doc id="19961701" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19961701" title="Goal-line technology">
Goal-line technology

In association football, goal-line technology (sometimes referred to as a Goal Decision System) is a method used to determine when the ball has completely crossed the goal line with the assistance of electronic devices and at the same time assisting the referee in awarding a goal or not. The objective of goal-line technology (GLT) is not to replace the role of the officials, but rather to support them in their decision-making. The GLT must provide a clear indication as to whether the ball has fully crossed the line, and this information will serve to assist the referee in taking his final decision. In the wake of controversial calls made in the Premier League, 2010 World Cup and the Euro 2012, FIFA (previously against the technology) is testing potential candidates for goal-line technology. Nine systems were initially tested, but only two remain.
On 5 July 2012, IFAB officially approved the use of goal line technology. The two systems approved in principle were involved in test phase 2: GoalRef and Hawk-Eye. In December 2012, FIFA announced it would introduce goal-line technology in a competitive match for the first time at the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan.
Background.
The question of the inclusion of goal-line technology began to be raised in 2000 as a result of a penalty shootout during that year's Africa Cup of Nations final, when Victor Ikpeba's penalty for Nigeria against Cameroon was deemed by the referee not to have crossed the line after deflecting off the crossbar. To the contrary, television replays showed that it had. Cameroon went on to win the shootout and thus the "Trophy of African Unity".
Interest was ignited in the United Kingdom after a game between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in January 2005, in which Tottenham midfielder Pedro Mendes hit a shot 55 yards from goal. United goalkeeper Roy Carroll caught the ball and then dropped it at least a yard over the line before hitting it back out, but neither the referee nor the linesmen saw the ball cross the line.
In response to this, FIFA decided to test a system by Adidas in which a football with an embedded microchip would send a signal to the referee if it crossed a sensor going through the goal. According to FIFA president Sepp Blatter, "We did different tests at the Under-17 World Cup in Peru but the evidence wasn't clear so we will carry out trials in junior competitions in 2007". However, those trials did not materialise and by 2008, Blatter had rejected the system outright, describing the technology as 'only 95% accurate'.
Another incident occurred in August 2009 in a league match between Crystal Palace and Bristol City. Striker Freddie Sears knocked the ball over the line from close range, but the ball bounced off the stanchion below the net and then came back out. The goal was not given and Palace manager Neil Warnock was furious. In March 2010, the International Football Association Board, which determines the laws of the game, voted 6-2 to permanently ditch the technology, with the Scotland and England football associations casting the dissenting votes. In a recent poll of 48 captains in the UEFA Europa League, 90% of respondents said that they wanted goal-line technology introduced.
Following several refereeing errors at the 2010 FIFA World Cup – including the disallowed goal in Germany's 4–1 victory over England, when Frank Lampard hit a shot from outside of the penalty box that bounced off the crossbar and over the line; the ball came back out and the goal was disallowed because the assistant referee did not call for a goal – Blatter announced that FIFA would reopen the goal-line technology discussion.
Another instance of a controversial call was Chelsea’s 2–1 victory over Tottenham in 2011. Frank Lampard hit a shot just before halftime that slipped through the legs of Tottenham's goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, and almost crossed the line before being tipped back into play, however the assistant called for a goal and Chelsea tied the game. Chelsea were credited with another goal that did not cross the line against the same opponents in the 2012 FA Cup semi-finals, leading again to calls for goal-line technology.
Goal-line technology consideration came up again after Euro 2012. With Ukraine losing 1-0 to England, Marko Dević lobbed the ball over Joe Hart before it was cleared off the line by John Terry, neither the referee or the assistant referee saw the ball going in, however television replays showed that the ball clearly was going in when it was blocked, but the goal wasn't counted. FIFA is planning to use goal-line technology during the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
The role of IFAB.
As with all changes to the Laws of the Game, IFAB must sanction the use of goal-line technology. Six votes are required to make any changes. FIFA holds four votes and each of the world's first four football associations carries one vote. These are England's The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales and Northern Ireland's Irish Football Association.
Initial testing.
In July 2011, FIFA sanctioned tests on ten goal-line technology systems, requiring that the system notified the referee of the decision within one second of the incident happening. The message needed to be relayed via a visual signal and vibration. Tests were conducted by Empa between September and December 2011.
Cairos GLT system.
Produced by a German company Carios Technologies AG, alongside Adidas, the GLT system used a magnetic field to track a ball with a sensor suspended inside. Thin cables with electrical current running through them are buried in the penalty box and behind the goal line to make a grid. The sensor measures the magnetic grids and relays the data to a computer which determines if the ball has crossed the line or not. If the ball does cross the line a radio signal is sent to the referee’s watch within a second. Adidas designed a ball that could suspend and keep a sensor safe and intact even when the ball is struck with great force. Cairos claims the process is practically instantaneous, addressing critics' concerns that the technology might slow down the game. An older system developed by Cairos was trialled at the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship, but was found not to be fast or accurate enough.
On February 25, 2013 FIFA granted a licence to Cairos Technologies AG, enabling them to provide goal-line technology for use in FIFA-sanctioned competitions.
Goalminder.
The Goalminder system has two co-founders, Harry Barnes and Dave Parden, who first thought of the system after their favourite team, Bolton Wanderers, was relegated due to a wrongly disallowed goal. The technology was not picked up at the time, but after Frank Lampard’s disallowed goal in the 2010 World Cup, interest in goal-line technology spiked causing FIFA to investigate the possibility of sanctioning goal-line technology. The technology uses high-speed cameras built into the goal posts and cross bar to record images at 2000 frames per second and deliver visual evidence to the referee, in less than five seconds, to settle goal-line controversy. With this technology there is no calibration: just visual evidence. The system is thought to be cheaper because less expensive cameras will be needed and the field will not have to be dug into.
GoalRef.
GoalRef features a passive electronic circuit embedded in the ball and a low-frequency magnetic field around the goal. Any change in the field on or behind the goalline is detected by coils embedded in the goal frame, which determine the scoring of a goal.
Hawk-Eye.
The Hawk-Eye system was first developed in 1999. Hawk-Eye is an existing technology currently used in cricket, tennis and snooker. It is based on the principle of triangulation using the visual images and timing data provided by high-speed video cameras at different locations around the area of play. The system uses high frame rate cameras to triangulate and track the ball in flight. The software calculates the ball’s location in each frame by identifying the pixels that correspond to the ball. The software can track the ball and predict the flight path, even if several cameras are being blocked. The system also records the ball's flight path and stores it in a database that is used to create a graphic image of the flight path, so the images can be shown to commentators, coaches and audiences. The data from the system can also be used to determine statistics for players and analyse trends. The proposal involves placing seven cameras for each goal mouth around the stadium. The system is near real-time and referees will be notified on their encrypted watch in less than one second from the ball crossing the line. Critics of the system claim the system will slow down the game and that the statistical margin of error is too large. Both Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have criticised the accuracy of the system in tennis (though Roger Federer now supports the use of the system in football).
IFAB discussion of candidate technologies.
On 3 March 2012, IFAB announced that 2 of the 9 proposed systems had proceeded to the second stage of testing.
Hawk-Eye.
The first match to use the Sony-owned Hawk-Eye goal-line technology was Eastleigh F.C. versus A.F.C. Totton in the Hampshire Senior Cup final at St Mary's Stadium, Southampton in England on 16 May 2012. Although it used Hawk-Eye, the system had no bearing on the referee's decisions and the system readings were only available to FIFA's independent testing agency. The system was also in place for the technology's second test on 2 June for England's friendly match against Belgium.
Introduction.
In December 2012, FIFA announced it would introduce goal-line technology at the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan. Hawk-Eye technology was employed at Toyota Stadium, while GoalRef was used at International Stadium Yokohama.
In April 2013, FIFA announced that GoalControl, a camera-based system, would be used at the 2013 Confederations Cup and, if successful, would be implemented at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Then later in October 2013, FIFA announced that GoalControl, a camera-based system, would be used at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Its system, GoalControl-4D, uses 14 high-speed cameras located around the pitch and directed at both goals. 
Criticism.
While advocates for goal-line technology maintain that it would significantly reduce refereeing errors during play, there are also criticisms of the technology. Much of the criticism comes from within FIFA itself including FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Apart from the criticisms revolving around the technical aspects of the two proposed technologies, critics point out that such technology would impact on the human element of the game and remove the enjoyment of debating mistakes. Sepp Blatter has been quoted as saying "Other sports regularly change the laws of the game to react to the new technology. ... We don't do it and this makes the fascination and the popularity of football".
A study suggested that in the 2010–11 Premier League season "errors took place nearly 30% of the time that video replays could help prevent", but some people claim that instant replays would interrupt the flow of the game and take away possible plays.
Other critics believe it would be prohibitively expensive to implement the technology at all levels of the game and particularly for smaller/poorer football associations. FIFA officials have expressed a preference for 'better refereeing' as well as more match officials over implementing the technology.
Advocates in turn cite the many examples of incorrect goal-line decisions deciding important games and point out that the technology has improved much since the initial trials carried out by FIFA. Advocates contend that any extra help for the referee should outweigh arguments that it would lead to non-uniform rules (since not all football associations would be able to implement it).
Blatter had been opposed to goal-line technology until Frank Lampard’s disallowed goal in the 2010 World Cup. He now says that the technology could be in place by the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. UEFA president, Michel Platini will likely oppose the plan, and instead propose additional referees beside each goal.
The introduction of the so-called "fifth official", i.e. the extra assistant referee standing beside the goal-line, was partly in order to facilitate in such situations.

Rover-BRM

The Rover-BRM was a prototype gas turbine-powered racing car, jointly developed in the early 1960s by the British companies Rover and British Racing Motors (BRM).
Rover had already been working with gas turbines for road vehicles since World War II . A series of potential road cars had also been produced, from the early prototype "Jet 1" through the more developed examples "T2", "T3" & "T4". "T4" had even displayed demonstration laps around the Le Mans circuit, before the 1962 race. Seeing an opportunity for even more prestige, Rover decided to enter a gas turbine car into the race. A prize was to be awarded for the first gas turbine car to complete 3,600 km over the 24 hours, an average speed of 93 mph.
A crucial step in this plan was a chance meeting between William Martin-Hurst, MD of Rover, and Sir Alfred Owen of Rover's component supplier Rubery Owen, but more relevantly also of the Formula 1 constructors BRM. BRM supplied the chassis of Richie Ginther's crash-damaged car from the 1962 Monaco Grand Prix. A custom open-top spyder body was then built in aluminium, with the turbine mid-mounted ahead of a single-speed transaxle.
The first test runs were at the MIRA track in April 1963, driven by Graham Hill who described it thus, “You’re sitting in this thing that you might call a motor car and the next minute it sounds as if you’ve got a 707 just behind you, about to suck you up and devour you like an enormous monster.” The top speed is quoted to be 
Engine.
The gas turbine engine was of typical practice for Rover, with a single centrifugal compressor, a single combustion chamber and a free turbine driving the output shaft, separate from the turbine that drove the compressor. It was rated at 150 bhp.
Racing career.
1963 Le Mans.
The car ran at Le Mans, carrying the race number "00" as an experimental car. The turbine engine was judged to be equivalent to a 2 litre, but was permitted twice the usual fuel allowance. Le Mans has always taken an interest in fuel efficiency and some classes depend on achieving particular figures.
Graham Hill and Richie Ginther, who had past experience of the same chassis in a different guise the year before, drove in the race.
The 3,600 km figure was achieved with hours to spare, and with peak speeds down the Mulsanne Straight exceeding 140 mph. The overall averages were of 107.8 mph and 6.97 mpg. As the only car in its class it was unplaced, but its performance by a petrol engined car would have placed it in 8th place.
1964 Le Mans.
For the 1964 season, the major change was the addition of a pair of ceramic rotary regenerators to the gas turbine, so as to improve efficiency. Although often reported as "heat exchangers", these use a different technique. Two honeycomb disks rotate slowly at 20 rpm with both inlet and exhaust airflows passing through them, but separately. This heats the disk, which then rotates, and in turn heats the inlet air. Regenerators slightly restrict the peak power of a gas turbine, but hugely increase its efficiency in compensation.
The car also gained a new body, a closed coupe designed by Rover's William Towns. To improve intake airflow, large pods were also added over the rear intakes, resembling a Ferrari 250 LM.
There was little time to test the new engine however, and the car was also slightly damaged during transport. For one of these reasons (history is unclear just which), the team withdrew from Le Mans that year.
1965 Le Mans.
The 1964 engine was now used to race in anger. Rather than running as an "experimental", it was numbered "31" and was a competitor against others in the 2 litre class. The fuel allowance was also now the same as for the piston cars, making the regenerators even more important. Graham Hill and Jackie Stewart were to drive.
Allegedly owing to sand from the side of the course being sucked in when Graham Hill ran wide early on, the turbine blades were damaged. The engine began to overheat and for the rest of the race had to be monitored carefully to ensure that the exhaust gas temperature wasn't exceeded. Some hours later, while Stewart was driving, the tip of a turbine blade broke off and damaged one of the regenerators with a massive explosion, although the engine kept on running.
The car performed well though, finishing tenth overall, seventh in the prototype class, and the first British car. The average speed was slightly lower than previously at 98.8 mph but consumption had fallen in half to 13.51 mpg.
Survival today.
After the 1965 Le Mans, the car was once briefly tested on public roads by the magazine "Motor", but retired completely by 1974. In recent years the car is nominally on display at the Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.
Work progresses to restore it to running and demonstrable order, so it may not always be on display at all times.

Hybrid SaaS

There are three types of Hybrid SaaS [http://www.crmbuyer.com/story/48681.html [http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/sbp/?p=329] model:
The traditional Hybrid SaaS model is where the customer may deploy the software as a SaaS service or as on-premises solution, with the ability to switch from one to the other as needed.
This model has arisen in response to the drawbacks of the pure SaaS model and is claimed by proponents to provide the advantages of the SaaS model, while mitigating the potential drawbacks. For example, the hybrid model allows companies to move the system in-house when:
There are corresponding arguments against this model. For example, the software provider must design the product to support both in-house installation and its use as a hosted service.
The ‘HomeBrew’ Hybrid SaaS model, where a customer uses functionality from both the cloud via SaaS, combined with a more traditional solution on-premises. Both solutions are operational at the same time, unlike the traditional hybrid SaaS model detailed above. This kind of model would most typically be used for content security solutions with transient data already on the ‘public’ internet, such as email traffic. The chief benefit of this type of solution is that a high percentage of content can be removed before they reach the premises of the customer, reducing hardware and bandwidth requirements. The main disadvantages are that two disparate solutions are in use, which means two management consoles to monitor and configure the solutions, as well as two sets of licence/subscription costs.
The Next Generation of Hybrid SaaS solutions are just becoming available. They extend the HomeBrew hybrid SaaS model to include interoperating solutions situated both on the customer’s premises, as well as located within the cloud, therefore building on the strengths of the homebrew model and removing many of the drawbacks.
Typically, the cloud component is located within a managed datacentre operated by a service provider, who would often also be the vendor of the on-premises solution. As per the homebrew hybrid SaaS model, both solutions are operational at the same time. However, the main difference is that the solutions are not disparate – links exist between the on-premises solution and the cloud platform in order to mitigate the drawbacks of the Homebrew Hybrid solution. Examples of these links may be the retrieval of log information - the administrator can login to a single console and see consolidated information returned from both the cloud platform and the on-premises solution in a single report. Another example may be the ability to configure both the cloud platform and the local solution from one console, with the hybrid component appearing as a ‘seamlessly integrated’ part of the solution.
As both solutions are often from a single vendor, the cost of licencing is often much less than a solution based on both a cloud component and an on-premises solution combined.
Some commentators believe that the next generation of hybrid SaaS solutions will replace pure SaaS. Others, especially the pure SaaS vendors, argue the opposite. As with all such commercial questions, it is the market that will decide.

Jarosław Marek Rymkiewicz

Jarosław Marek Rymkiewicz ("Jarosław Marek Szulc"; born 13 July 1935, in Warsaw) is a Polish poet, essayist, dramatist and literary critic. He is the son of Władysław Szulc, of German and Polish origin, who changed his last name to Rymkiewicz (a writer) and of Hanna Baranowska, of German and Tatar origin (a physician). 
As a poet, he is influenced by the traditions of classicism and the baroque. He has received multiple prizes for his novels, essays, and translations, including the Kościelski Prize (1967), S. Vincenz Prize (1985), and Polish PEN Club Prize. His volume of poetry "Zachód słońca w Milanówku" won the prestigious Nike Award in 2003.
Although Rymkiewicz is primarily a poet, he is better known as the author of two influential novels that contributed to the two most important debates of the 1980s: that involving martial law (1981) and Polish-Jewish relations. His novel "Rozmowy polskie latem", 1983 ("Polish Conversations in Summer" 1983) discusses the meaning of being Polish and the preoccupation with achieving independence. Rymkiewicz’s second novel, entitled "Umschlagplatz" (1988), had a greater impact. Instytut Literacki, the largest Polish émigré publishing house, originally published the novel in Paris in 1988 as it could not appear in communist Poland. It was reprinted a few times by underground publishing houses in Poland but officially appeared only in 1992 after the communists lost power in 1989. It was translated into French (1989), German (1993), and English (1994).
The novel focuses on the symbolic meaning of Umschlagplatz, which denotes a small square in German-occupied Warsaw (1939–1945) from which the Germans sent more than 300,000 Jews to their deaths, and thus a place which "may well be the only place of its kind" in the world. (p. 7, Umschlagplatz). He attempts to understand the implication of the existence of such a place for the contemporary Warsaw and the contemporary Poles. It took Rymkiewicz two years of study and research to create a detailed plan of the square. He concluded that Germans introduced the name Umschlagplatz sometime before July 1942; in pre-war Poland the place was called Transfer Square and was the center for the Jewish wholesale trade.
As an essayist, Rymkiewicz concentrates on Polish history (the partition period, World War II).
He supports the conservative Law and Justice political party.

Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut

Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut is an independent, nonprofit organization with offices in Meriden, Connecticut. The foundation supports the mission of its parent organization, CHART (Connecticut Health Advancement and Research Trust). The foundation has assets of approximately $30 million.
Purpose.
The foundation has several ideas for universal health care that it believes can be enacted and be affordable for government, consumers and businesses. The organization insists on certain benchmarks: universality, affordability for families and individuals, high quality care, and the ability to continue health care coverage through changing circumstances. The foundation says it believes health care is a fundamental right.
History.
In 1997, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Comptroller Nancy Wyman and a coalition of advocacy and labor organizations sued the for-profit Anthem Insurance Co. over its merger with the non-profit Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Connecticut. The aim was to recover tax benefits and other concessions that the former Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Connecticut had received over several decades. The lawsuit was dropped after Anthem Insurance agreed to a settlement in 1999. As a result, the state established the Connecticut Health Advancement and Research Trust. Anthem Foundation of Connecticut was incorporated as a supporting organization to CHART.
It is one of about 165 foundations nationwide to be created by conversions of nonprofit health corporations to for-profit entities. As a condition of these conversions, the law requires that the assets of the nonprofit be retained for some public purpose.
At the time, Attorney General Blumenthal called the agreement "a historic victory". The foundation received $41 million to carry out the conditions of the settlement. It was charged with working toward system-wide health care reform. The agreement established Anthem Foundation's legal obligation to help improve health care for those who need it most. The foundation was incorporated in 2000. It opened its first offices in New Haven, Connecticut. In January 2003, Juan Figueroa, a former community organizer, former Connecticut legislator, former assistant attorney general of Connecticut and former president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York, became foundation president. In 2004, the foundation changed its name to reflect a final separation from the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut. At the time, Figueroa stated that no relationship with Anthem existed and that the foundation's main focus was passage of universal health care.
Since 2004, the foundation has awarded over $7 million in grants to organizations to advance that goal.
In 2007, the Hartford Business Journal chose Juan Figueroa as a 2007 "Health Care Hero".
SustiNet.
Since 2005, the foundation has developed relationships with several key groups that would be instrumental in creating broad change in the health system, including medical societies, hospitals, businesses, labor and clergy.
In January 2009 the foundation unveiled SustiNet, a proposal for a statewide health care plan for Connecticut that would provide residents with their choice of health coverage and care regardless of their employment status, age, or pre-existing conditions. An estimated 1,000 people attended a rally at Union Station (Hartford) for the release of the plan.
SustiNet would emphasize preventive care and the management of chronic illnesses. It would create a large health insurance pool by combining state employees, retirees, and people covered by state assistance programs. The pool would also be open to members of the public without insurance, those with inadequate insurance, and employers, starting with small businesses, nonprofits and municipalities. Eventually, Sustinet would be open to larger employers wishing to insure their employees through the plan.
According to analysis by the nation's leading health economists, SustiNet would reduce the proportion of state residents without health coverage from 12 percent to 2 percent by 2014. In addition, SustiNet would bring about savings in the private sector which would far exceed additional state government expenditures. 
In February, the 18,500-member Connecticut Association of Realtors announced its support for the SustiNet health care plan, explaining that as self-employed individuals, realtors bear the total cost of their insurance premiums, and consequently many are priced out of the market. In addition, the independent statewide organization Small Businesses for Health Care Reform endorsed the proposal and encouraged other business owners to review and support it.
In March, the foundation's plan was formally endorsed by the Interfaith Fellowship for Universal Health Care, a group devoted to health reform, and by dozens of other religious leaders representing a wide range of faiths in Connecticut. Fellowship members include Rabbi Stephen Fuchs of Congregation Beth Israel in West Hartford, a co-chairman of the Interfaith Fellowship, and Bilal Ansari, a Muslim chaplain at Saint Francis Hospital & Medical Center in Hartford, where much of his counseling involves helping families cope with not just the stress of a relative's illness, but the worries about how they will pay for it.
SustiNet passed its first hurdle in the General Assembly's joint committees on Thursday, March 26, receiving a favorable report from the Public Health Committee, which voted 22-8 to move the bill forward. Successively, others did likewise: the Human Services Committee, 13-6 on April 22, Labor and Public Employees Committee, 8-3 on the 29th, and Insurance and Real Estate, 13-4 on May 7.
On May 20, 2009, the House of Representatives voted 107-35 for SustiNet, and on the 30th, the Senate did the same, 23-12. 
SustiNet was sent to Governor M. Jodi Rell, who vetoed it on July 8. 
On July 20 the governor's vetoes were overridden by the Connecticut House of Representatives with a vote of 102 to 40 and then by the Connecticut Senate with a vote of 24-12.
The SustiNet law establishes a nine-member board to recommend to the legislature, by January 1, 2011, the details of and implementation process for a self-insured health care plan called SustiNet. The recommendations must address (1) the phased-in offering of the plan to state employees and retirees, HUSKY A and B beneficiaries, people without employer-sponsored insurance or with unaffordable, small and large employers, and others; (2) establishing an entity that can contract with insurers and health care providers, set reimbursement rates, develop medical homes for patients, and encourage the use of health information technology; (3) a model benefits package; and (4) public outreach and ways to identify uninsured citizens.
The board must establish committees to make recommendations to it about health information technology, medical homes, clinical care and safety guidelines, and preventive care and improved health outcomes. The act also establishes an independent information clearinghouse to inform employers, consumers, and the public about SustiNet and private health care plans and creates task forces to address obesity, tobacco usage, and health care workforce issues. The effective date of the SustiNet law was July 1, 2009 for most provisions.
The work of the nine member SustiNet board began in July 2009 and in September two more position were added to the board. The now 11 member board will guide four committees and three task forces, which will report to the General Assembly in July 2010. Enrollment in the program will begin in July 2012.

The story follows three girls, sisters Ai; Mai; and Mii; and their maid, Mea, as they travel through time without aging, along with the mansion they live in. One of the sisters occasionally gathers crucial intelligence from conversations with dandelions—referred to as "popotan"—as they search for the mysterious figure of Shizuku. "Popotan" is a play on the Japanese word for "dandelions", "tanpopo". It was developed by Shaft, directed and storyboarded by Shinichiro Kimura, and written by Jukki Hanada. The characters were designed by Haruka Sakurai and originally created by Akio Watanabe, under the alias of Poyoyon Rock.
Twelve episodes were produced. They originally aired on Tokyo Broadcasting System's satellite station BS-i, from July 17, 2003 through October 2, 2003, and were also made available at the same time on the Bandai Channel. On August 27 and 28, 2003, the an event with the first volume Japanese DVD of "Popotan" was shown Animate Ikebukuro in Japan. The event featured guest appearances by the anime's voice actress for the three sisters.
On June 27, 2003, a teaser DVD with character designs by Haruka Sakurai was released. The DVD, contains video interviews with the anime's voice actors, a CD containing music to the radio drama's, , theme , metallic paint illustrations and a plushie of Unagi. The anime was released on Japanese DVD by Bandai Visual in six discs of two episodes each. The set was released in staggered fashion between September 26, 2003 and February 25, 2004.

10th Mississippi Infantry

The 10th Mississippi Infantry was a regiment of infantry in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. It fought in several campaigns and battles in the Western Theater.
"Old" 10th Mississippi.
The 10th Mississippi Infantry was organized in March 1861 with an original enrollment of 841 officers and men for a term of one year. Among the officers was future Confederate general Joseph R. Davis, a nephew of President Jefferson Davis. The original companies, under the command of Col. Seaburne M. Phillips, were: 
The troops assembled in Mobile, Alabama, and were transported to Pensacola, Florida, for garrison duty there to help man the coastal defenses. They encamped near Fort Barrancas, opposite Fort Pickens and Santa Rosa Island, both held by Union troops. Several companies engaged in building new fortifications or strengthening existing ones, as well as supporting the artillery crews during periodic bombardments over four months. Colonel Phillips and scores of other men died of disease while stationed near Pensacola. The depleted regiment fought in the Battle of Santa Rosa Island in October 1861.
In February 1862, the regiment was sent back to Mississippi, where it was brigaded with other Mississippi troops under the overall command of Col. James R. Chalmers. The term of enlistment expired in March.
"New" 10th Mississippi.
The regiment was reorganized at Corinth on March 15, 1862, for a term of two years. The new companies were:
In April, the new 10th, now under the command of Col. Robert A. Smith and numbering only 360 men, fought in the Battle of Shiloh in West Tennessee. It later participated in Braxton Bragg's Kentucky Campaign and suffered significant casualties at the Battle of Munfordville, including Colonel Smith. Chalmers' Brigade, including the 10th Mississippi, was part in the advance toward Louisville in September. Under Col. James Barr, Jr., the 10th fought in the Battle of Perryville before retreating with Bragg's beaten army across the Cumberland Gap on October 20. Marching through Tennessee, the regiment camped near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in November. It fought in the subsequent Battle of Stones River in late December and early January 1863.
The 10th again was part of a general Confederate retreat, finally encamping near Tullahoma, Tennessee, until July 1863 when it advanced to Chattanooga and then on to Bridgeport, Alabama. It subsequently participated in the Chickamauga Campaign in September and in the attack on Missionary Ridge at Chattanooga in November before retreating to winter quarters near Dalton, Georgia.
In the spring and summer of 1864, the 10th participated in the Atlanta Campaign. Colonel Barr was mortally wounded in the Battle of Marietta and replaced by James M. Walker. The survivors were part of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign in November before wintering near Meridian, Mississippi. In the spring of 1865, the consolidated regiment took part in the Carolinas Campaign before surrendering with the army of Joseph E. Johnston at Bennett Place in North Carolina in April.

National Textile Association

The National Textile Association is the United States's oldest and largest association of fabric-forming companies. NTA members knit and weave fabric in the U.S.; supply fibers, yarns to the fabric-forming industry; or supply other materials or services to the American textile industry.
History.
The National Textile Association traces its history to 1854, the founding date of the Hampden County (Massachusetts) Cotton Spinners' Association, subsequently renamed the New England Cotton Manufacturers' Association (1865). The organization was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on December 1, 1894. The organization became the National Association of Cotton Manufacturers (NACM) in April, 1906. The Northern Textile Association was founded April 17, 1953 by the NACM, in time for the 100th Annual Meeting of the Association in 1954. The NACM and NTA held joint meetings from April 17, 1953 to September 27, 1956. On December 7, 1956 the NACM filed the legal change of name to NTA. (On October 30, 1991, the legal name was changed to Northern Textile Association, Inc.) In 2002, by a vote of the Knitted Textile Association (founded in 1966) in August and the NTA in September, the Knitted Textile Association and the Northern Textile Association merged to form the National Textile Association.
Governance.
The Association is governed by officers—chairman, vice chairman, president, vice president, treasurer and secretary—elected annually and a board of directors elected for three-year terms and divided into three classes so that one-third of the directors are elected each year. Roger Berkley of the company Weave Corporation is the current chairman of the Association.

Video gaming in Lithuania

Video gaming has become more popular in Lithuania, as well as in other European Union members. Although video games industry in Lithuania is only developing, there are some challenges for gamers, such as minor cybersport events.
News about video games.
Although Lithuania is not a very big country but there are still many of those who want to read the news about video games. In result a few major sites were opened to fill up this need.
Game development industry.
Lithuania's game development industry is very small, but in recent years there was a substantial increase in small companies and single developers working on games for iOS platforms (iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad). Most companies are exporting games to larger foreign markets like UK or US, because local market is still very small and selling only locally for profits is very hard if not impossible. The largest game developer community gathering place is GameDev.lt ([http://gamedev.lt/]) portal.
There are several events that attempts to gather developers for making connections, to share knowledge or simply to have a good time. Since 2009 local chapters of Global Game Jam were organized each year. In 2009 there was only one chapter in Vilnius city, but in 2010 there were two chapters in Vilnius and Kaunas cities. Several conferences focusing on game development also were organized, but they are not regular and last one was held in 2004. Each year, several smaller informal and irregular meetings are held in Vilnius or Kaunas bars, usually organized from GameDev.lt portal by its community.

Henry W. Peckwell (1854, New York, New York – after 1914) was an American artist. He was best known for his work as a wood engraver, for publications such as "Scribner's Magazine" and "Harper's Magazine".
Personal.
Peckwell was born and raised in New York City, where he also spent his career.
In 1905, he resided at The Alpine apartment building at Broadway and 32nd Street.
He was an active member of the New York Athletic Club over the course of several decades.
Career.
Wood Engraving.
Peckwell's wood engravings were part of the "new school" of wood engraving in the last decades of the 19th century, and his work employed and advanced that school's innovatory and more subtle techniques. The persistence of finely crafted hand-done wood engravings in the face of modern photoengraving was also noted in the 1897 "Columbian Cyclopedia", which noted in its entry on "wood-engraving" that Peckwell was "among the most noted and skillful of the present school."
He was also numbered among a group of "splendid engravers" by the "Brooklyn Museum Quarterly" in 1916.
His engravings, usually after paintings by other artists, appeared not only in national magazines such as "Scribner's" and "Harper's", but were also collected in primers such as "The Children's Second Reader" by Ellen M. Cyr.
Other Engraving.
He also did engraving work on commission, for works such as bookplates.
Art Instruction.
In 1909, Peckwell was recorded as a tutor at the City College of New York with a salary of $1,300.00 which was then increased to $1,400.00.

British Columbia Technology Industry Association

The British Columbia Technology Industry Association (BCTIA) is a not-for-profit member-funded trade association in British Columbia, Canada, which promotes the technology industry in the province. The technology industry in BC has been growing steadily since the late 1990s and constituted 5.9% of British Columbia's economic output in 2007.
The BCTIA has a membership base of over 2,100 companies ranging from start-ups to established organizations, and spanning a variety of technology-related sectors including education, hardware, software, life sciences, manufacturing, natural resources, web technology and green energy. The BCTIA facilitates partnerships and programs within the BC technology industry, as well as advocating on behalf of association members and the industry as a whole.
History.
The BCTIA was incorporated in 1993 with the amalgamation of the Electronic Manufacturers' Association of British Columbia (EMABC) and the Information Technology Association of Canada, BC Chapter (ITAC-BC). Over the years, the BCTIA has provided opportunities for professional development, delivered industry-focused events and programs, and exerted political influence on the industry’s behalf, as well as working with the BC government and BC universities to double the number of students graduating in the fields of computing sciences and computer and electrical engineering.
Over the years, the BCTIA has led a number of initiatives designed to support the growth of BC’s technology industry. In 2004, it launched the Integrated Technology Initiative (ITI), a coalition of BC science and technology stakeholders led by the BCTIA that was involved in analyzing and consolidating existing research to develop a competitive strategy for BC’s science and technology industry. In 2006, the BCTIA partnered with the not-for-profit British Columbia Regional Science & Technology Network (BCRSTN) to facilitate collaboration, innovation, and commercialization of research.
In June 2007, the BCTIA joined forces with the Power Technology Alliance to support the growth of the clean technology industry in British Columbia, which comprises more than 200 companies working to develop clean, green energy and renewable energy sources and services. To this end, the BCTIA has established a Clean Energy Technology Program and a Clean Tech Industry Advisory Group to ensure that these companies have the capital, human resources, and access to markets they need to grow and prosper.
In October 2007, Dr. Pascal Spothelfer, former president and CEO of Spectrum Signal Processing, replaced Rob Cruickshank as president and CEO of the BCTIA.
Current activities.
The BCTIA has been working with BC’s Ministry of Advanced Education and Labour Market Development to create a technology action plan for British Columbia. In addition, the BCTIA hosts a number of regular events, including CTO Roundtables, Technology Forums, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Bootcamps, and the annual Technology Impact (TIA) Awards, as well as working to develop and recruit talent through its TechTalent BC initiatives 
Technology Impact Awards.
The annual BC Technology Impact Awards were founded by the BCTIA in 1994. There are three categories of TIA awards: Technology Awards, Company Awards, and Personal Recognition Awards. To participate in the TIA awards, a technology company must have its head office based in British Columbia or have established a significant operating division complete with senior management in the province. TIA winners benefit through media recognition and the opportunity to connect with potential investors, advisors, mentors, and partners. TIA winners in recent years have included AbeBooks, Strangeloop Networks, Business Objects, and EQO Communications.
TechTalentBC.
The BCTIA takes an active role in developing local talent and recruiting skilled technology workers through a number of initiatives, including awarding scholarships to BC students who plan to make their careers in science and technology, and offering foreign recruitment workshops and other programs to help fill the 10,000 BC job openings in technology and related fields projected for 2008 alone.
The BCTIA also conducts various industry studies to generate a greater understanding of BC’s technology industry. These studies enable industry organizations to offer more targeted industry development campaigns and strategic corporate growth programs. One such study, the 2007 TechTalentBC Labour Demand survey, was undertaken with the assistance of the Information and Communications Technology Council. This study sought information regarding difficulties companies have in attracting top talent and the strategies they use to increase their headcounts.
Members.
High-profile members of the BCTIA include companies such as Sierra Wireless, MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates, PMC-Sierra, Bell Mobility, Electronic Arts (Canada) Inc., IBM Canada, Maximizer Software, the Microsoft Canada Development Centre, Nokia, Sony Canada, Sun Microsystems, Telus, and Ballard Power Systems.
BCTIA members also include research and development organizations such as the National Research Council (Canada), government organizations such as the BC Innovation Council and Industry Canada, non-profit educational centres such as TELUS World of Science (formerly Science World), worldwide technology organizations such as the Society for Technical Communication, and professional services firms that serve the technology industry such as PricewaterhouseCoopers.
In addition, BCTIA membership includes universities and university offices such as the British Columbia Institute of Technology, the University of British Columbia University-Industry Liaison Office, Douglas College, and the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design.

<doc id="19962175" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19962175" title="Timbral listening">
Timbral listening

Timbral listening is the process of actively listening to the timbral characteristics of sound.
Concept.
In timbral listening, 'pitch is subordinate to timbre'. Instead, the specific quality of a musical tone is determined by considering 'the presence, distribution and relative amplitude of overtones.'
When using this listening technique/ method of perception / interpretation there is 'a relation between timbre and spectral content which is analogous to that between pitch and frequency in that one is the prevalent cultural construct of the other'
The most common form of timbral listening is listening to speech. This is demonstrated by listening to, for example, the vowels /a/ and /i/ spoken at the same pitch and intensity. The difference between the two sounds is entirely one of spectrum, or as the term is used in this article, timbre.
Nature.
It has been suggested that "timbral listening is an ideal sonic mirror of the natural world". It is often (but not always) used in association with musics that are based in mimicry of sounds in the natural environment. Valentina Suzukei suggests that 'it was the nomadic way of life and its focus on the timbral qualities of natural sounds that created this kind of musicality'. This is especially prevalent in Canada where composers such as Hildegard Westerkamp apply the thinking of R. Murray Schafer's World Soundscape Project to their compositions.
Descriptive language and notation.
As timbre has 'no domain-specific adjectives' it 'must be described in metaphor or by analogy to other senses', This method also has limitations.
Examples.
The composition of timbre-centered music in the nomadic communities of Tuva involves mimicry of sounds heard in the environment. Timbral listening is a fundamental component of listening to, understanding and being able to correctly perform this music using vocal techniques such as throat singing "khoomei" and harmonic producing instruments such as the jaw harp, bzaanchy, shoor, qyl qiyak, qyl-gobyz,ku-rai and igil. 
This music employs a fundamental drone and overtone harmonics. It consists of "a whispered text, accompanied by the "inanga", a trough zither of eight strings. To listen correctly (using timbral listening), one must consider "the effect of the combined timbres of the noisy whisper and the inanga" as a whole sound.
More recently, computers and synthesizers are being used by contemporary composers to produce timbral-centered music. Contemporary composers state timbral listening as the correct technique to adopt in listening to and analysing their timbre (as opposed to pitch) based compositions. 'Pure timbres' are explored using methods such as granular synthesis in works such as 'Dragon of the Nebula' by Mara Helmuth.
The music produced by the Shakuhachi end blown flute such as honkyoku, contains timbral variations that are of equal importance to pitch variations. These timbral variations are indicated in Shakuhachi musical notation.
Application.
The technique of timbral listening is used by sound engineers to evaluate timbre difference.

Vehicle registration plates of Mexico

Vehicle registration plates of Mexico are issued with unique visual designs by each state, but with one national numbering system, such that serials are not duplicated in multiple states. Most states change designs approximately every third year, with each state on its own plate replacement cycle. Every year owners Mexican plated vehicles pay the "tenencia" or "revalidación de placas" (car plates renewal tax). A set of Mexican plates includes one pair of plates, a windshield sticker, and in a few states a plate sticker.
In 2001 the size of the plate number was reduced in order to accommodate the addition of the state number, legend indicating the position of the plate on the vehicle ("delantera" (front) or "trasera" (rear)), and additional graphics.
Mexican plates are issued in several different classifications: Private, Private "Fronteriza", Public, Public "Frontera", "Servicio Público Federal", "Inspección Fiscal y Aduanera", "Armada de México", and "Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores". The "Fronteriza" plates were introduced in 1972 and are available in the Mexico-United States border zone. This zone is formed by the Baja California and Baja California Sur states, as well as parts of Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas. While the state of Nuevo León shares a border with the U.S., it does not have any cities within the border zone.

James F. Reed

James Frazier Reed (November 14, 1800 - July 24, 1874) was a businessman, soldier and, most notably, an organizing member of the ill-fated 1846 Donner Party emigration to California.
Early life.
Reed was born in County Armagh in Ireland of noble Polish stock. After the death of his father Reed emigrated with his mother to the United States. Once there his mother sent him to live with a family member in Virginia where he worked as a clerk in the family store. In about 1825 Reed moved to Illinois where he took an interest in mining. While living in Illinois Reed ran several businesses and took part in the Black Hawk War of 1832, serving with Abraham Lincoln. He married Margret Keyes Backenstoe, a widow with a baby daughter, in 1835. The couple had four more children in Springfield: Martha Jane (called Patty), James F. Reed, Jr., Thomas Keyes, and Gershom Francis, who died as an infant. Reed never formally adopted Margret Reed's eldest daughter, Virginia Elizabeth Backenstoe, but she went by the name Virginia Reed.
The Donner Party.
In 1845 Reed decided to head west to California and organized a small group which left the Springfield area in the spring of 1846. The other members were George Donner and his brother Jacob, along with their families and hired hands. Each head of household had three wagons. In addition to two supply wagons, Reed had a particularly comfortable one made for his family to ride in, which has since become legendary. The Reeds and Donners left Springfield on April 14, 1846, and on May 19 joined a large wagon train led by William H. Russell.
While camped in Wyoming the Reeds, Donners, and several other families decided to take a new route, Hastings Cutoff, and elected George Donner captain, creating the Donner Party. They separated from the other emigrants on July 20. While crossing the desert west of the Great Salt Lake Reed was forced to abandon two of his wagons after losing nearly all his oxen. The Donner Party re-joined the California Trail near Elko, Nevada, on September 26, having taken three weeks longer than the traditional route.
On October 6, while traveling along the Humboldt River, Reed became embroiled in a quarrel between two teamsters and in the ensuing fight stabbed John Snyder to death. The other emigrants decided to banish Reed; initially he refused to accept their decision, but finally agreed to go ahead to Sutter's Fort in the Sacramento Valley for supplies. After a difficult journey, during which he nearly starved, Reed reached the fort on October 28. After two days' rest, he attempted to take provisions back to the wagon train, but deep snow blocked the way. The early onset of winter had trapped the Donner Party in the Sierra Nevada. They contrived shelter, hoping to resume their journey, but were forced to spend the winter in the mountains. They were already low on supplies and had to slaughter their oxen for food. As the winter wore on, many of the emigrants starved to death; some resorted to cannibalism.
In the meanwhile, Reed, now stuck in California, tried to organize another relief expedition but turmoil from the Mexican-American War not only disrupted his efforts but forced him to take up arms. On January 2, 1847, Reed participated in the Battle of Santa Clara. While in the area, Reed took steps to secure land for himself in Santa Clara, where he would eventually bring his family.
In early February 1847 the citizens and naval officers of San Francisco funded a rescue party. Its leader was Selim E. Woodworth, a naval officer, with Reed as his second-in-command. Reed rounded up men and supplies in the Sonoma and Napa valleys north of San Francisco Bay, then headed up into the mountains. Reed met his wife Margret, his stepdaughter Virginia, and son James Jr. coming out of the mountains. After an emotional reunion Reed and his men continued on to the camp where his remaining children, Patty and Thomas, were still stranded. Reed brought a party of emigrants from the camps, but a severe blizzard trapped them at the top of Donner Pass for two days, during which the party ran out of food. When the storm ceased, most of the refugees were too weak to continue. Reed departed with his children, but was forced to leave the others behind; a few days later, however, another rescue party arrived and brought them out.
Post Donner Party Life.
Reunited, the Reed family recuperated in the Napa valley for many weeks. In the summer of 1847 Reed took his family to San Jose where he began an active community life. He was a real estate developer and also speculated in various mining enterprises. During the Gold Rush, Reed headed to Placerville where he earned wealth mining for gold. Reed was a leading proponent of a plan to make San Jose the capital of California, going so far as to donate four city blocks to the cause. Reed died in San Jose on July 24, 1874, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery. Several streets in modern downtown San Jose still bear the names of his family members, including Reed, Margaret, Virginia, Keyes, and Patterson streets.

RightChange.com

RightChange.com is an American conservative political group. It is devoted to electing conservative U.S. Republican Party candidates, thus the reference to the political right in its name. It spent millions supporting Republican candidates in the 2010 general election. 
It defines itself as an organization that "engages Americans through informed, fact-based content delivered in a creative format and through multimedia platforms to allow viewers to develop their own conclusions about the most critical economic and national security policies of our day. RightChange cuts through the political spin by using politicians’ own words, votes and actions to hold them accountable." Its funding mostly comes from Fred Eshelman, a North Carolina pharmaceutical business owner.
Campaigns and actions.
In a last-minute campaign ad, RightChange used images from the September 2001 World Trade Center attacks to assert that Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama would "undermine the terror strategy that protects us".
During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, RightChange sponsored television commercials and said that "For years, John McCain warned of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s risk to the economy and pushed for reform" while "Democrats defended Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac." RightChange also attacked Democratic candidate Barack Obama, claiming that his "economic proposals stick small businesses with the Bill for the Wall Street Bailout."
The Associated Press reported on September 16, 2008, that RightChange.com "plans to spend about $1.5 million in the next two weeks on national cable networks including Fox News Channel, CNN, and CNN Headline News, said spokesman Tim Pittman. Rightchange.com is financed largely by pharmaceutical executive Fred Eshelman, who has given more than $200,000 to Republican candidates and party organizations since 2002, according to Federal Election Commission records.
The Tax Foundation, a tax research group based in Washington, D.C. that has been operating since 1937, analyzed the claims made by RightChange in one of its ads and concluded that they were "spreading nonsense ... so ridiculous that I'm almost at a loss for words ... an outright lie."
Funding.
According to National Public Radio, RightChange "reported $2.7 million in contributions from its president, Fred Eshelman, CEO of PPD, a pharmaceutical research firm in North Carolina. Eshelman donated $3.38 million to RightChange in 2010. PPD's chairman, Ernest Mario, gave an additional $1 million. Mario also runs Capnia Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif.-based company developing a system to treat migraines using medical gas." NPR noted that "RightChange.com's other directors also have connections to the health industry. Board member Jeff Barnhart is CEO of Cabarrus Community Health Centers, which RightChange's corporate secretary, Fletcher Hartsell, helped found. Both Barnhart and Hartsell are Republican state legislators in North Carolina."

Anschutz Medical Campus

The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus is one of two campuses of the University of Colorado Denver. It is located in Aurora, Colorado. The campus is the location of the University's health sciences-related schools and colleges, such as the University of Colorado School of Medicine, the U.C. School of Pharmacy, the U.C. College of Nursing, the University of Colorado School of Dentistry, and the Colorado School of Public Health, as well as the graduate school for various fields in the biological and biomedical sciences. 
The Anschutz Medical Campus is sometimes referred to by its initials, "AMC". The other campus of the University of Colorado Denver is at the Auraria Campus located near downtown Denver.
The campus is located on a portion of the former Fitzsimons Army Medical Center. After the base was decommissioned in 1999, the campus became known as the Fitzsimons Medical Campus, or simply "Fitzsimons." The name of the portion of Fitzsimons that houses the university facilities was changed to its current name in 2006 after the Anschutz family donated $91 million to construct the Anschutz Centers for Advanced Medicine, which include the Anschutz Outpatient and Cancer Pavilions, and the Anschutz Inpatient Pavilion, all located on the campus. The remainder of the former base is now called the Fitzsimons Life Science District and includes a Colorado Science+Technology Park, the Children's Hospital, the future Veterans Affairs hospital, and a residential/retail town center known as 21 Fitzsimons.
History.
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.
The University of Colorado created the Department of Medicine and Surgery in September 1883 in the Old Main building on the Boulder campus. This department granted its first degrees in 1885.
By 1892, the last two years of classes were taught in Denver because the larger population afforded more practical experience. This practice triggered somewhat of a turf battle with the private medical school at the University of Denver, and the resulting legal battle went all the way to the Supreme Court of Colorado. In 1897, the Supreme Court found that the charter of the University of Colorado restricted it to teaching in Boulder. 
Then in 1910, University of Colorado persuaded the legislature to amend the state constitution, and this allowed the university to move its medical school back to Denver. In 1911, the School of Medicine merged with the private "Denver and Gross Medical College" to form a larger school with a more comprehensive program, thus paving the way for the medical school to move permanently to Denver. 
In 1925, the U.C. School of Medicine moved to a campus on 9th Avenue and Colorado Boulevard in Denver. This eventually became the modern University of Colorado Health Sciences Center (the Anschutz Medical Campus in the long run). 
In 1947, the University of Colorado Hospital assumed responsibility for patients referred to it from the Denver General Hospital. The state paid for their care, and medical and nursing students got instruction.
In 1995, Fitzsimons Army Medical Center was put on the Base Realignment and Closure list by Congress. Officials from the Health Sciences Center, the University of Colorado Hospital, and the City of Aurora presented a proposal to the Department of Defense to utilize part of the decommissioned Army medical center as an academic health center for the University of Colorado. 
In 2004, the first medical school laboratories moved from Denver to the research towers on the Fitzsimons grounds. Then in 2006, the Fitzsimons campus was renamed the "Anschutz Medical Campus" in recognition of the large donations of money from Philip Anschutz and his wife Nancy Anschutz. 
By the end of 2008, all of the academic and research operations of the University of Colorado at Denver health sciences schools and colleges had been relocated from their 
older campus in Denver to the new Anschutz Medical Campus, joining the University of Colorado Hospital and The Children's Hospital (Colorado).
Merger with the University of Colorado at Denver.
In the summer of 2004, the University of Colorado at Denver and the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center merged to create the University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center (“UCDHSC”). As a result, the University of Colorado encompasses three institutions, down from four. 
On October 29, 2007, the board of regents voted to rename UCDHSC as the "University of Colorado Denver." The new branding covers both the Anschutz Medical Campus and the Downtown Campus. This has reportedly been a source of frustration for the City of Aurora, whose representatives feel slighted that the location of one of the university's two campuses is not reflected in the university's name. Officials have since agreed to add "in Aurora" to "The University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus", referring only to one half of the university, but this remains an unsatisfactory solution. One state senator has proposed the moniker "University of Colorado Denver/Aurora". In January 2010, it was reported that the University of Colorado will remove the word "Denver" from the Anschutz Medical Campus, referring to it only as University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
Anschutz Medical Campus.
The University of Colorado Hospital, a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Colorado Denver, opened its new $644 million, facility at the Anschutz Medical Campus in 2007. The Children's Hospital, with , opened in 2007 to the south of the campus. U.S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs Hospital broke ground in August 2009 and will open at the Anschutz Medical Campus in 2013.
Academic Profile.
On the Anschutz Medical Campus, the University of Colorado Denver houses the School of Dental Medicine, the School of Medicine, the College of Nursing, the School of Pharmacy, Colorado School of Public Health, and the Graduate School. The School of Medicine is the only medical school in Colorado. The graduate school at the Anschutz Medical Campus offers 26 MS and PhD degrees focusing on basic, clinical and translational research in the biomedical sciences, and its programs feature highly in various national rankings (see Rankings).
School of Pharmacy.
The University of Colorado's School of Pharmacy (SOP) began in 1911 as a division of the School of Medicine in Boulder. It became an independent college in 1913 and a school in 1957. It received its accreditation in 1938-1939 and awarded a B.S. in Pharmacy degree in 1995-1996 when it received a full accreditation status awarding the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree by the ACPE. In 1986, the School of Pharmacy was administratively transferred to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. The physical transfer from Boulder and final consolidation of faculty, staff and students was completed between August and November 1992. In 2008, the school moved to the Anschutz Medical Campus, and is involved in teaching, research and public/professional service in areas unique to the practice of pharmacy, the pharmaceutical sciences, molecular toxicology, and pharmaceutical outcomes research. 30% of its class is from out of state. In 2008, the NIH awarded $7,271,657 and $19,056,438 in grants towards the SOP and Pharmacology department, respectively. In the Spring of 2010, the school moved into its new building, the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences also on the Anschutz Medical Campus.
Research.
In 2007, more than $373 million in research and training grants and contracts was awarded to University of Colorado Denver researchers. The vast majority of this research is dedicated to health sciences at the Anschutz Medical Campus. In 2012, more than $179 million was awarded by the National Institutes of Health to UC Denver researchers. The university is considered by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education to have "very high research activity" with a basic classification of "Research Universities (RU/VH) (very high research activity)". The core laboratories in the research complex, at the Anschutz Medical Campus, include mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, a 900 mega-hertz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer, flow cytometry, DNA array and peptide protein chemistry.

Architecture and Layout.
The Anschutz Medical Campus is a campus for the University and the University of Colorado Hospital. All of the facilities on the campus, with the exception of the former Fitzsimons Hospital (referred to as 500 Main, or "Building 500"), are new construction. A series of distinct quadrangular zones on the campus governs its architectural design: the research quadrangle, consisting of the three Research Complex towers, features a contemporary glass and metal design, Research Complex I and II were designed by Fentress Architects in association with Kling Stubbins; the education quadrangle is characterized by a brick aesthetic; and the core quadrangle is located on the central axis of the campus, and anchored by Building 500. The medical library is located along the center quadrangle of the campus, and was designed as a joint venture between Davis Partnership Architects of Denver and Centerbrook. 
The combined of the Anschutz Medical Campus and the Fitzsimons Life Science District is undergoing a $4.3 billion renovation and transformation into the largest medical-related redevelopment project in the United States. The "Colorado Science + Technology Park" in Aurora is being developed directly adjacent to the health sciences areas of campus, providing opportunities to collaborate with biotechnology companies and their resources. The remaining acres of the former military facility are dedicated to commercial, hospitality, retail, and residential development.
Built as state-of-the-art, the Anschutz Medical Campus consists of three zones: an education zone with facilities for training in the medical and health-related fields, a research zone that houses the various graduate programs, and a clinical care zone with the University of Colorado Hospital and The Children's Hospital, the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine's primary adult and pediatric hospital partners, nearby.

State Revolving Fund

A State Revolving Fund (SRF) is a fund administered by a U.S. state for the purpose of providing low-interest loans for investments in water and sanitation infrastructure (e.g., sewage treatment, stormwater management facilities, drinking water treatment), as well as for the implementation of nonpoint source pollution control and estuary protection projects. A SRF receives its initial capital from federal grants and state contributions. It then emits bonds that are guaranteed by the initial capital. It then "revolves" through the repayment of principal and the payment of interest on outstanding loans. There are currently two SRFs, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund created in 1987 under the Clean Water Act, and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund created in 1997 under the Safe Drinking Water Act.

Tribal colleges and universities

Tribal colleges and universities are a category of higher education, minority-serving institutions in the United States. The educational institutions are distinguished by being controlled and operated by American Indian tribes; they have become part of American Indians' institution-building in order to pass on their own cultures. The first was founded by the Navajo Nation in 1968 in Arizona, and several others were established in the 1970s. As of 1994, they have been authorized by Congress as land-grant colleges. 
History.
Most tribal colleges are located on or near Indian reservations and provide access to post-secondary education, accredited degrees, and vocational training for both Indian and non-Indian students. The first was established in 1968 by the Navajo Nation on their reservation in Arizona. Several other tribal colleges were established in the 1970s and enrollment has steadily increased.
Indian culture and tradition have become a part of the curricula since the 1970s, when many of the colleges were established. These institutions face problems similar to those of other rural educational institutions: recruitment and retention of students and faculty, and curriculum issues. Lack of funding, along with minimal resources of some tribes, are additional obstacles. For some Native American nations, revenues from casino gambling have aided in their building educational institutions.
In general, enrollment has increased significantly, particularly in areas where reservations have significant populations. In 1982, the total enrollment at tribal colleges in the United States was approximately 2,100. By 2003, it had increased to 30,000. This also reflects a return to reservations by numerous American Indians, for instance, on the Great Plains. By contrast, California's tribal college, D-Q University west of Davis, California, was struggling with six students in 2006. 
In 1994 under the Elementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization Act, the tribal colleges were authorized by the US Congress as land-grant colleges. Most offer two-year degrees, although six are four-year institutions, and two have master's degree programs. Several colleges, such as the College of the Menominee Nation, have developed transfer agreements with affiliated state universities to allow students who graduate from the two-year tribal college to receive junior status at the state university system. Sinte Gleska University in South Dakota has a master's program affiliated with Red Crow Community College and Canadian universities in Alberta, Canada.
As of 2013, Montana is the only state that has a fully accredited tribal college for each Indian reservation. The University of Montana "was the first to establish dual admission agreements with all of the tribal colleges and as such it was the first institution in the nation to actively facilitate student transfer from the tribal colleges." This is possible, in part, because "Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a constitutional mandate to teach American Indian history, culture, and heritage to preschool through higher education students via the Indian Education for All Act."
Affiliations.
The American Indian Higher Education Consortium, founded in 1972, represents 32 tribal colleges in the US and one in Canada. The organization is jointly governed by presidents from the member institutions.
Special programs.
Based in Huntsville, Alabama, Tribal Earth Science & Technology Education (TRESTE) is a NASA-funded team of nine tribal higher education institutions and the Universities Space Research Association's Earth System Science Program. The collaboration is designed to enhance Earth system science and geospatial education using problem-based teaching techniques in order to inspire undergraduate students for careers in Earth system science, the physical sciences, and other fields of engineering or science.
Alternate tribal higher education programs are available, including the Tribal College Librarians Institute (TCLI), a week-long professional development experience for U.S. and Canadian tribal college librarians.
Publications.
The award-winning "Tribal College Journal of American Indian Higher Education" is a culture-based publication addressing issues in American Indian and Alaska higher education with articles by journalists and scholars. It provides a forum for tribal students, staff, faculty, and college administrators to discuss their needs, successes, and missions. 
Scholarships.
The American Indian College Fund, originally located in New York City, but now based in Denver, Colorado, provides scholarships for US tribal colleges and universities. Foundation and private-sector donations are crucial to its success. Its mission is to transform Indian higher education through funding and awareness of the community-based, accredited tribal colleges and universities, while offering student access to knowledge, skills, and cultural values in order to enhance both the communities they serve and the country as a whole.
Other scholarship programs abound, including many that are unique to a specific program, geographic area or tribe. Examples are the Tribal Training Grant, Tribal Higher Education Scholarship program, and Alyeska Match Scholarship. and Intertribal Higher Education Program.
The Native American Journalists Association (NAJA), founded by the Oglala Lakota Tim Giago, has a foundation offering scholarships and internships to American Indian students in journalism. It also sponsors three seminars annually for working American Indian journalists and those in the business end.

Agbami Field

Agbami Field is an oil field in Nigeria. Discovered in late 1998, it was the second major deepwater oil field discovered off the Niger Delta, the first being Bonga Field by Shell.
The field is located in nearly 1,500 meters (4,900 ft) of water off the central Niger Delta. The operator of the field is Star Deep Water Limited, an affiliate of Chevron. Also involved in the field are Famfa Oil, an indigenous oil company owned by the Alakija Family of Lagos, Petrobras (Brazil), Statoil, and NNPC (the national oil company of Nigeria).
Geology.
Most of the reserves are in lower and middle Miocene deepwater turbiditic sandstones and reserves are estimated at 900 MM barrels with upside to perhaps 1.5 B making it either the biggest or second biggest (to Bonga) deepwater field in Nigeria. Its crude oil quality is very high API gravity in the high 30's (very flowable) and the crude is sweet (low sulfur). The trap is mainly anticlinal 4-way rollover but internally the doubly plunging anticline is cored by a small reverse fault and upwardly diapiric mobile shale or mud. The northwestern portion of the field is overthrusted at shallow levels. 
Production.
Production began in 2008 at over with peak production estimated to be at approximately 250,000 bls/d. The Floating Production unit is the length of three football fields and cost over $US4 billion to build.

Duchess Violante Beatrice of Bavaria

Violante Beatrice of Bavaria (Violante Beatrix; 23 January 167330 May 1731) was Grand Princess of Tuscany as the wife of Grand Prince Ferdinando of Tuscany and Governor of Siena from 1717 until her death. Born a Duchess of Bavaria, the youngest child of Elector Ferdinand Maria, she married the heir to the Tuscan throne, Ferdinando de' Medici, in 1689. Violante Beatrice loved him but Ferdinando did not return her affection, declaring her too ugly and too dull. Her brother-in-law, Prince Gian Gastone, befriended her out of sympathy, a friendship that lasted until Violante Beatrice's demise.
Grand Prince Ferdinando expired from syphilis in 1713, leaving his childless widow without purpose at the Tuscan court. Upon the return of the Electress Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, daughter of the then reigning, Cosimo III, thus Violante Beatrice's sister-in-law, the Dowager Grand Princess contemplated retiring to her brother's court at Munich; however, Gian Gastone convinced her to stay, and Cosimo III appointed her Governor of Siena, where she then resided. As Governor, she formally defined the boundaries, names and number of Sienese "Contrade" — akin to administrative divisions — in 1729. During Grand Duke Gian Gastone's rule, the Governor was responsible for formal court audiences. Violante Beatrice, in collaboration with the Electress Anna Maria Luisa, attempted to withdraw Gian Gastone from the "Ruspanti", his salacious entourage, by arranging banquets and public appearances. Gian Gastone, however, was immune to these approaches and spent the last eight years of his reign confined to bed, entertained by the myriad "Ruspanti".
Childhood and marriage.
Violante Beatrice, the youngest child of the Elector of Bavaria, Ferdinand Maria, and Henriette Adelaide of Savoy, was born on 23 January 1673 in Munich, the capital of Bavaria. Her siblings were Maria Anna Victoria, Dauphine of France, Elector Maximilian II and Joseph Clemens, Archbishop of Cologne.
Grand Duke Cosimo III of Tuscany in 1688 sought Violante Beatrice as a prestigious bride — Bavaria was one of the most powerful states of the Holy Roman Empire — for his elder son and heir, Ferdinando, Grand Prince of Tuscany. As Cosimo's father, Ferdinando II, had embroiled Elector Ferdinand Maria in an abortive financial venture costing him 450,000 ungheri worth of gold, relations between Munich and Florence were sour.
In order to acquire Violante Beatrice's hand for the Grand Prince, Cosimo was obliged to reimburse Ferdinand Maria's son Maximilian II. With this obstacle surmounted, the marriage contract was signed on 24 May 1688, granting Violante Beatrice a dowry of 400,000 thalers in cash and the same amount in jewellery. She married the Grand Prince by proxy in Munich on 21 November 1688 and was married in person on 9 January 1689. The wedding reception was held at the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence. The new Grand Princess was instantly enamoured with the bridegroom, in spite of the fact he loathed her. Cosimo III, however, could not find fault in his daughter-in-law, saying, "I have never known, nor do I think the world can produce, a disposition so perfect".
Grand Princess.
The grand princely couple's lack of offspring after six years of marriage perturbed the Grand Duke. Consequently, much to the Grand Princess's mortification, he commissioned three days' religious observance to remedy their lack of children in April 1694. Any hopes of an heir were dashed when Ferdinando contracted, in 1696, syphilis during the Carnival of Venice, a disease to which he succumbed seventeen years later. The Grand Princess, meanwhile, fell victim to a state of melancholy, which did not escape the notice of her brother-in-law, Prince Gian Gastone, who befriended her as a result. Violante Beatrice rarely alluded to her emotional pain in conversation, but, on one documented occasion, in the presence of her ladies, branded Ferdinando's lover Cecchino de Castris the focus of her woes. That Ferdinando often openly declared his wife "too dull and too ugly" only worsened matters.
The Grand Princess found herself, in 1702, in the middle of a protocolary spat between Tuscany and Spain. The Grand Duke sent an agent to the court of Philip V of Spain with the objective of procuring a license for the Grand Prince and Princess—who, hypothetically, acquired royal dignity with Cosimo III on 5 February 1691 from the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I's, diploma—to use the style "Royal Highness" in correspondence with Spain. Philip V initially deigned only to sanction his aunt Violante Beatrice's use; however, the agent, Pucci, eventually requisitioned full recognition.
King Philip V and Frederick IV of Denmark paid Violante Beatrice visits in 1703 and 1709, respectively. The former chose to ignore the other members of the Tuscan Royal Family and reluctantly deigned only speak to her. The latter, on the other hand, was taken with Violante, going as far as to refuse to leave the room while she was changing clothes.
The Grand Prince, after much suffering, died from syphilis on 31 October 1713, sparking a succession crisis and leaving his wife a childless and therefore purposeless widow. The Dowager was so distraught that she had to be bled by doctors in order to calm her down. Cosimo III gave her a set of blue sapphires as a token of mourning. Violante Beatrice considered returning to her homeland when she caught wind of the Electress Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici's, born a Tuscan princess, impending return; the two did not get along. Violante Beatrice, additionally, would be usurped as first-lady of Tuscany. To quell any future tiffs regarding precedence, Cosimo III appointed Violante Beatrice Governor of Siena, whose duties as such kept her away from the Tuscan court, and gave her possession of the Villa di Lappeggi, which became, in the words of historian Harold Acton, "a sort of literary academy". Here, she feted poets Lucchesi, Ghivanizzi and Morandi. Although precedence was laid out cognisant of Violante Beatrice's dignity, the Electress on several occasions disregarded it. Thus, Violante Beatrice refused to appear with her in public.
Governor of Siena.
The Governor entered her domain in April 1717, taking up residence in the city-centre. Violante Beatrice's most memorable act as Governor was the reorganisation of the Sienese "Contrade" — akin to administrative divisions — whose names, number and boundaries she formally defined which remain there to this day. The Grand Duke Cosimo III died on 31 October 1723; Gian Gastone ascended to the throne. He immediately recalled Violante Beatrice to Florence and banished his sister to the Villa La Quiete. Violante Beatrice dominated the royal court as Gian Gastone resigned his public duties to her, and literally chose to spend most of his time in bed. The "religious gloom" of Cosimo III gave way to a period of rejuvenation: Violante Beatrice instituted French fashions at court, compelled myriad Ecclesiastes to retire and patronised Siense poets Perfetti and Ballati. Violante Beatrice brought Perfetti to Rome in 1725 and stayed at the Palazzo Madama. During her time in the Papal States, she met Pope Benedict XIII, who found her so agreeable that he bestowed upon her the golden rose, a great mark of Papal favour.
Upon her return from Rome, Violante Beatrice and the Electress Anna Maria Luisa decided to do something about Gian Gastone's public image and the "Ruspanti", his entourage. In order to distract him from the "Ruspanti", Violante Beatrice threw banquets, to which she invited the foremost members of Tuscan society. The Grand Duke's behaviour, vomiting, belching and cracking rude jokes, literally sent the guests scrambling to leave. The Electress was more fortunate for her part. She succeeded in making Gian Gastone appear on Saint John the Baptist's day, 1729. However, during the ceremony, the Grand Duke became so intoxicated that he had to be dragged back to his palace, the Pitti, on a litter.
Just five months before the arrival of troops on behalf of Gian Gastone's Spanish heir, Violante Beatrice of Bavaria, Dowager Grand Princess of Tuscany, Governor of Siena, died. During the funeral procession, her hearse briefly paused before the Pitti, an action that incensed the Grand Duke, who ordered the hearse to move along in words a contemporary dubbed "unfit for the lowest of harlots, let alone for a gentle high-born princess". The bulk of Violante Beatrice's remains were interred in the Convent of Saint Teresa, Florence; her heart was placed in her husband's coffin in the Medicean necropolis, San Lorenzo. When in 1857 her sarcophagus was re-discovered, it bore the imperial stamp of Napoleon I of France, who had had it moved from the convent to San Lorenzo. On 26 February 1858, she was restored to the convent, brought there in the royal hearse.

Hermann Schmitz

Hermann Schmitz (January 1, 1881 – October 8, 1960) was a German industrialist and Nazi war criminal. CEO of IG Farben from 1935 to 1945, he was sentenced to four years in prison in the IG Farben Trial.
Schmitz was born in Hessen on 1 January 1881, son of factory worker Diedrich Schmitz and Luise Wöhrmann. In 1898 he began studying at "Ahrenbergische Aktiengesellschaft für Bergbau und Hüttenbetrieb" in Hessen, and in 1905 he entered the Commerce College in Nuremberg. After completing his studies, he was hired by "Metallurgische Gesellschaft" (metallurgy company), where after some time he became consultant of Wilhelm Merton, member of the superivosors' council of the company, who helped Schmitz promote his career.
In 1914 he was required to serve in the army. He was injured during the First World War and, after recovering from his injuries, he was made Reich's supervisor for chemical products production in the matériel department (1915).
In 1919, as an expert in fertilizers and nitric salts, he took part in the assembly that negotiated the Treaty of Versailles. There he met Carl Bosch, a chemist of worldwide fame. In July 1919 Schmitz was hired at BASF by Bosch as his financial advisor. He was promoted to administrator of BASF's exterior department, a position he maintained after the company became part of IG Farben. As per his job requirements he maintained contacts with large businesses, such as Standard Oil, with which he took part in negotiations, always having the support of that era's governments in the interests of IG Farben.
War crimes.
In 1933, he was elected to the Reichstag under the administration of the National Socialist Partyand after two years, he succeeded Carl Duisberg as IG Farben's CEO when he died. In 1938, he became war economy administrator (Wehrwirtschaftsführer). In 1941, Hitler gave him a portrait of him with his autograph as a gift for his dedication to the aims of Nazi Germany. Schmitz led IG Farben until the end of the Second World War. He was arrested and tried at the IG Farben Trial, during which he was sentenced to four years imprisonment. He was freed in the end of 1950s and he went on to become member of the administrators' council of Deutsche Bank in Berlin, while he took the honorary president of "Rheinische Stahlwerke AG". 
Schmitz died in Heidelberg on 8 October 1960.

Saint John River (Liberia)

The Saint John River is one of the six main rivers in the West African nation of Liberia. With its headwaters in neighboring Guinea, the river flows generally southwest through Liberia and empties into the Atlantic Ocean at Bassa Cove near Edina in Grand Bassa County. The river has a drainage basin covering .
Course.
The headwaters of the river are in the Nimba Range of the Guinea Highlands in the country of Guinea and flow south towards the border with Liberia. Near Yalata, Guinea it begins to form the border between Guinea and Bong County in Liberia. Flowing generally south, it forms the international boundary for around 6 miles. At Niatande, Liberia, it meets the Mani River and enters Liberia, forming the boundary between Bong and Nimba counties. The river then flows to the southwest for approximately before turning to the southeast for a stretch. Near Zahn it takes a small river, and turns southwest again.
After about it begins to form the boundary between Bong and Grand Bassa counties and turns west for about 10 miles. The river then continues to the southwest, and after approximately it enters Grand Bassa County. After around it turns south for eight miles (13 km) and then flows back to the southwest for approximately 10 miles.

Pyongyang Nalpharam

Pyongyang Nalpharam () is a 2006 North Korean film directed by Phyo Kwang and Maeng Cheol-min. It is a martial arts film set during the Japanese colonial rule of Korea. One of only two North Korean films released in 2006, it received ticket sales of 6 million cinema-goers in that country. Critics describe the film as "routine" and "adequate."
Plot.
The film is set in the early 20th century, during the Japanese colonial rule of Korea. Jeong Taek is a master of Pyongyang Nalpharam, a form of the ancient Taekkyeon martial art perfected on Mount Taeseong near Pyongyang. He returns home one day to find his father poisoned by Korean-born Japanese woman Mieko, who claims that the elder was responsible for the death of her own father. At first mistaking the woman for his childhood sweetheart, So Gyeon, Taek is forced into action when Japanese forces lay claim to the sacred texts containing the secrets of Pyongyang Nalpharam.
Release.
"Pyongyang Nalpharam" was released in August 2006, and received a reported 6 million admissions at the North Korean box office. It was one of only two North Korean films released in 2006—the other being "The Schoolgirl's Diary"—and both films were screened at that year's Pyongyang International Film Festival.
Critical reception.
Derek Elley of "Variety" described "Pyongyang Nalpharam" as "a routine period actioner... with flashes of interest for Asiaphile auds", reminiscent of 1970s Hong Kong "chopsocky" films. He regarded the action choreography as being "adequate", and considered only a single sequence during a "masked entertainment" to have any "real verve".

Minuscule 892 (Gregory-Aland)

Minuscule 892 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), ε 1016 (Soden). It is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament, on 353 parchment leaves (23.5 cm by 11.5 cm). It is dated palaeografically to the 9th century.
Description.
The codex contains almost complete text of the four Gospels with some lacunae. The texts of John 10:6-12:18 and 14:23-end were inserted by later hand (on paper, about the 16th century). The text is written in one column per page, in 20 lines per page, in minuscule letters.
It includes the text of the Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11) (the first important Greek-only manuscript to have the pericope), , Luke 22:43–44, 23:34, and of course Mark 16:9-20. All these texts were questioned by early Alexandrian manuscripts. In this manuscript was omitted interpolation of the Alexandrian text-type in Matthew 27:49. 
Words written continuously without separation. Hermann von Soden observed that the manuscript preserved the division in pages and lines of its uncial parent. The Ammonian sections and the Eusebian Canons were given in the left-hand margin. 
Synaxarion and Menologion were added in the 13th century. John 10:6-12:18; 14:24-21:25 was added by later hand in the 16th century.
Text.
The Greek text of the codex, is a representative of the late Alexandrian text-type, with some the Byzantine readings. It is one of the most important of all minuscule manuscripts. It contains many remarkable readings of an early type. According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents the Alexandrian text-type as a core member.
It is probably the best survived minuscule witness to the Gospels. Aland placed it in Category II.
Matthew 19:16
In Mark 6:33 it has textual reading ἐκεῖ καὶ προῆλθον αὐτούς along with Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, 0187 (omit εκει), ℓ "49", ℓ "69", ℓ "70", ℓ "299", ℓ "303", ℓ "333", ℓ "1579", (ℓ "950" αυτους), itaur, vg, (copsa, bo).
In Mark 10:7 phrase και προσκολληθησεται προς την γυναικα αυτου ("and be joined to his wife") is omitted, as in codices Codex Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, Codex Athous Lavrensis, ℓ "48", syrs, goth. 
In Luke 4:17 it has textual variant καὶ ἀνοίξας τὸ βιβλίον ("and opened the book") together with the manuscripts A, B, L, W, Ξ, 33, 1195, 1241, ℓ "547", syrs, h, pal, copsa, bo, against variant καὶ ἀναπτύξας τὸ βιβλίον ("and unrolled the book") supported by א, Dc, K, Δ, Θ, Π, Ψ, "f"1, "f"13, 28, 565, 700, 1009, 1010 and many other manuscripts.
In John 1:28 it has textual variant Βηθαραβα together with the Codex Sinaiticus (second corrector), syrh and several other manuscripts.
In John 6:1 it reads της θαλασσης της Γαλιλαιας εις τα μερη της Τιβεριαδος – along with Codex Bezae, Θ, 1009, 1230, 1253.
History.
The codex was acquired by the British Museum in 1887 from H. L. Dupuis. Now it is located in the British Library (Add. 33277) at London.

Fractional Importance

Fractional Importance is a modern rock band from Los Angeles, California formed in 1998, consisting of Doug Gledhill (lead vocals and guitar), Nate Perry (bass and backing vocals) and Kevin Fessler (drums). Their sound has been described as ranging from alternative metal and post-hardcore to modern rock. Although the band never enjoyed mainstream success, they were one of the few independent rock bands to emerge from the saturated late 1990s Hollywood club scene who, through largely self-funded touring and relentless promotion, were able to amass a sizable fan base and influence younger L.A. based band bands coming up on the same scene.
History.
The original line-up consisted of Douglas Gledhill (Vocals/Guitar), Kevin Fessler (Drums) and John Holiday (Bass) who met while attending high school in Santa Clarita, CA. Shortly after their inception they self-released the LP "Indecision", followed by well-received shows on the famed Hollywood Sunset Strip. This was followed by the "Apathy" EP, produced by Donat Kazarinoff (Hoobastank, Alien Ant Farm). Bassist John Holiday left shortly thereafter and was replaced by Nate Perry, who assumed bass and co-writing duties. The band rejoined Kazarinoff at 4th Street Recording in 2001 to record their sophomore LP "Visions" which was released on the band's own "Dyspathy Records" and sold over 7,000 copies with no major distribution. The record was well received by various indie-rock critics and combined with relentless DIY touring, helped to solidify the band's growing regional popularity while also raising the band's awareness on a more national level; opening for such acts as Papa Roach, Smile Empty Soul and Seether.
After extensive touring throughout the western portion of the U.S. in support of "Visions", the band shortened their name to 'Fractional' in 2003 and signed with "11 Records", the vanity label of acclaimed producer John Travis(Kid Rock, Buckcherry). Travis produced demos of the band which featured drummer Chris Robyn from the influential rock band Far. They temporarily added Zack Lopez on second guitar to fatten up the live sound who played on their 2005 EP "A Love Letter Suicide" which included tracks recorded by Travis. By this time Fractional began receiving airplay on various college and commercial radio stations nationwide which scored the band opening slots for Smile Empty Soul, Seether, Trapt and Crossfade.
Despite several independent releases and playing nearly 1000 shows, Fractional failed to see commercial success and parted ways in 2005 to pursue other projects. Douglas Gledhill formed the band Un:armed with his brother Derek Gledhill. Nate Perry went on to play in the band Manic who released two EP's on Suretone/Interscope Records in 2007.

Avondale, Maryland

Avondale is an unincorporated community in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States. For statistical purposes, it is part of the Chillum census-designated place (CDP).
History.
The settlement of Avondale began in the late 1930s as a small residential subdivision at the intersection of Eastern
Avenue and Queens Chapel Road.
In the 1930s, development spread west from Hyattsville, Mount Rainier, and Brentwood, and subdivisions such as Queens Chapel Manor, Castle Manor, Avondale, and Green Meadows appeared. Developers of these subdivisions promoted the area’s convenient access into the city and its established utilities supply. Construction of the Avondale Grove subdivision began in 1939. By 1942, the community contained approximately 100 structures located along eight streets on a wedge-shaped tract. At the southern tip of the subdivision is Carson Circle, the community’s entryway forming a quarter-circle between the boundary streets of Queens Chapel Road and LaSalle Road. The interior roads of the subdivision parallel the arch form of Carson Circle and radiate northward. Along these streets are houses constructed in the 1940s and 1950s and includes subdivisions named Avondale Terrace and North Avondale. In the 1960s, the Avondale area along Queens Chapel Road was developed by a number of high-density apartment complexes and high-rises.
The Avondale Recreation Center was established from some of the land belonging to the former De La Salle College. The college opened in 1931. In 1962 Avondale became home to the St. Ann's Infant and Maternity Home operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. The community relies upon adjacent neighborhoods for schools and services such as police and fire protection. Also in Avondale is a storage facility for Washington Gas.

Mystery Date (game)

Mystery Date is a 1965 board game from the Milton Bradley Company, designed by Marvin Glass. It was marketed to girls 6 to 14 years of age, and was reissued in 1970, 1999, and in 2005.
In popular culture.
"Mystery Date" has been mentioned and featured in the 1994 Disney film "The Santa Clause," and parodied several times, including in the classic 1996 episode of "The Simpsons," "Summer of 4 Ft. 2." In 2012 it was the inspiration for the title of a "Mad Men" episode that used the game's themes of dating, masculine desirability, and Russian roulette approach to opening a door as a metaphor.
In the "Ren and Stimpy" episode "Sven Hoek", the game Mystery Date was paroded as "Misery Date".
Gameplay.
"Mystery Date" can be played with 2, 3, or 4 players. The object of the game is to be ready for a date by acquiring three matching color-coded cards to assemble an outfit. The outfit must then match the outfit of the date at the "mystery door". The date is revealed by spinning the door handle and opening the plastic door on the game board. The five possible dates are:
The date to be avoided is the poorly dressed "dud." He is wearing slovenly attire, his hair is tousled and his face sports a beard shadow. There was also a figure made out to represent a construction worker for another "undesirable" partner, as per prevailing values of the time.
In the 1970s game, a "picnic" date replaced the "bowling" date.
If the player's outfit does not match the date behind the door, the door is closed and play continues.

The Institute for Cultural Research

The Institute for Cultural Research (ICR) is a London-based, UK-registered educational charity, events organizer and publisher which aims to stimulate study, debate, education and research into all aspects of human thought, behaviour and culture. It has brought together many distinguished speakers, writers and Fellows over the years.
A statement issued in 2013 by the institute on its official web site reads: "As of summer 2013, the Institute has suspended its activities following the formation of a new charity, The Idries Shah Foundation."
History.
The Institute was founded in 1965 by the well-known writer, thinker and Sufi teacher Idries Shah to facilitate the dissemination of ideas, information and understanding between cultures. Its Objects and Regulations were officially first adopted on 21 January, 1966. For some time based at Tunbridge Wells in Kent, it is presently based in London. Shah acted as the Institute's Director of Studies whilst still alive. Nobel Prize-winning novelist Doris Lessing, who was influenced by Idries Shah, has also contributed to the Institute.
Aims and remit.
The Institute's stated aim is "to stimulate study, debate, education and research into all aspects of human thought, behaviour and culture" and to make the results of its members' academic work accessible to society and also to academics working in different fields.
The body, which has a number of distinguished Fellows, has published several dozen academic monographs and some books over the years and holds regular events. These events usually include a series of six lectures by specialists per year, and a two-day seminar which is usually held in the Autumn. The aim of these is "to connect ideas across disciplines, across cultures, and even through history" and to bring about a broader, more holistic understanding by looking at issues from several different perspectives, with particular interest in human thought and behaviour and issues neglected by contemporary culture.
In addition, the Institute supports projects in areas where freedom of access to facts is threatened, for example in the case of Afghanistan where assistance has been given to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)'s female educational projects.
All the Institute for Cultural Research's activities are open to the general public.

Wilkins lumber

Wilkins Lumber is a small family-owned business that is located in Milford, NH. 
History.
Edward (E. L.) Hartshorn built a sawmill on the brook at the bottom of his farm in 1808. Initially, the equipment was run by water-power from Hartshorn Brook, so the mill only operated when the water was high enough to generate power. Later, steam was used as a supplementary power source.
E.L. Hartshorn turned over the business to his son Jotham, and then it passed in turn to Frank Hartshorn, who expanded the sawmill's assets by acquiring timber land in Amherst, Mont Vernon and New Boston totally nearly . 
In 1880, Frank's daughter married Aaron Milton Wilkins. Aaron and Frank expanded the business; initially, they added a second story to incorporate box making. With the growth, hydro-power became obsolete and around 1891 (as the exact date is unknown), a steam plant was built to generate strong power through the summer months when there was insufficient water power. 
During the Great Depression, Wilkins Lumber barely held on. Then in 1938, a hurricane came that blew down 90 percent of the family’s farmed trees. What they could salvage they sold, and what was left was stored by the government in several locations. Going forward, they were able to rebound and continued to sell lumber to many of the local builders. 
In 1949, the Mill was struck by lightning, burning everything to the ground. A smaller mill was constructed in replacement. In 1957, the Frank Hartshorn Company was sold to Harold H. Wilkins and his son Harold Hartshorn Wilkins, Jr. They continued to operate under the name of Wilkins & Son. In 1963, Harold Sr. was killed and his son Harold Wilkins Jr. took over. He was soon joined by a nephew, Robert Wilkins. With the partnership, the name changed to Wilkins Lumber Company in 1973.
In 1980, a new mill was built across the street from the original location, away from the stream. In 1981, Harold Wilkins Jr.’s grandson entered the business, Thomas A. Wilkins. Thomas went on to buy out fellow partner Robert Wilkins, and now resides as the sole owner of one of New Hampshire’s oldest mills.
Tom Wilkins lives by the motto, “What we saw is what you get!” Lumber is all native, sold rough or planed. The mill also sells bark mulch (not dyed), woodchips, sawdust and shavings: every piece of the log is utilized.

Izabela Filipiak

Izabela Filipiak (born 1961 in Gdynia) is a Polish writer, an essayist, a columnist, and a scholar.
Biography.
She debuted in the beginning of the 90s as one of the most distinct figures of Polish literary life. In her short stories and essays, she promoted the new literature in democratic Poland as open to voices previously excluded from cultural discourse. Her novel "Absolutna Amnezja" published in 1995 critiques the communist past from the point of view socially maladjusted young women. The book mixes satirical representation of authoritarian schools and dysfunctional families with the historical events from the pre-Solidarity period, and discusses education as breaking the spirits of girls through an elaborate application of double standards. When the critics attacked the novel, Maria Janion, the renown literary historian, came to its rescue, thus launching the major debate about the absence of feminism in the Polish cultural tradition. 
Starting in the late 90s, Filipiak was teaching creative writing classes at the gender studies department of Warsaw University and in the College of Arts at Letters at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. She published a creative writing handbook, "Tworcze Pisanie dla Mlodych Panien", which she addressed mainly to women writers and men inspired to embrace their inner fem. She wrote an introduction to the first translation of Virginia Woolf's "A Room of One's Own". In 1997, she came out as a gay in the Polish edition of Cosmopolitan and on national TV. She claimed that coming out improved both her personal life and her career, as she began to write columns for top shelf magazines. Starting in 2000, her tone became more critical, and she began to comment on the rise of populism and homophobia in Poland. These columns were eventually published in the collection "Kultura Obrazonych", but by 2003 Filipiak lost all her press assignments. She connects this turn of events with the mobilization of the Christian right as Poland entered the European Union. 
In 2003 Filipiak left for the University of California at Berkeley for an appointment as a visiting scholar at the Institute of Slavic, East European, Eurasian Studies, and an affiliated scholar at the Beatrice M. Bain Research Group. In 2005, supported by her mentor Maria Janion, she received her Ph.D. from the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, but her thesis about political and artistic applications of transgender figures in East European modernism was considered subversive by established scholars. Between 2002 and 2006, Filipiak published a volume of poetry ("Madame Intuita"), a play ("The Book of Em") based on the life of Maria Komornicka, a haunted figure of Polish modernism, and "Absolutna Amnezja" went through a third printing. Still excluded by the mainstream, the writer decided to stay in the U.S. In 2009, she received an MFA in fiction from Mills College in California, then returned to Poland upon accepting a position in the American Studies Department at Gdansk University.
Since 2010, Filipiak has been the president of Writers for Peace Foundation whose goals are supporting minority voices and maintaining a network of artists concerned with issues of marginalized groups. In the fall of 2010, Writers for Peace confronted SKM, the local commuter train, regarding the lack of accessibility.
Filipiak specializes in the subject of exclusion, displacement, grief (and the lack of formulas for its public expression for gay people), documenting styles of radical resistance to social and cultural exclusion, irony and black humor, debt, war and privatization.

<doc id="19963054" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19963054" title="Export Control Act">
Export Control Act

The Export Control Act of 1940 was one in a series of legislative efforts by the United States government and initially the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to accomplish two tasks: to avoid scarcity of critical commodities in a likely pre-war environment and, more notably, to limit the exportation of materiel to pre-World War II Imperial Japan. The act originated as a presidential proclamation by Roosevelt forbidding the exporting of aircraft parts, chemicals, and minerals without a license, and was intended to induce Japan to curtail its occupation of the Indo-Chinese coast.
The text of the Act stated that whenever the President deemed it "necessary in the interest of national defense," he could prohibit or curtail the exportation of military equipment, munitions, tools and materials.
Although controls were first authorized in 1940 in regard to munitions and similar materials essential to the defense effort, its coverage was extended in 1942 to all commodities, and broader geographic coverage, following America's entry into World War II. The law was extended, with modifications through 1948, and it was envisioned that remaining controls would soon disappear at the time of re-enactment in 1949. The scarcity of certain goods in the world markets however, made continuance of controls necessary in order to prevent a drain on such goods from plentiful American supplies with its consequential inflationary effects. National security and foreign policy concerns, especially following the outbreak of the Korean War, were new and compelling reasons for passing the Export Control Act of 1949, and in extending it until (at least) 1958. The law included both domestic policies aimed primarily at conditions within the United States, as well as controls directed at conditions outside the country, as an instrument of American foreign policy. This is exemplified by the restrictions on export of certain strategic or military items to the Soviet bloc or to other countries which it felt, if permitted, would be detrimental to the foreign policy program of the US during the Cold War. The foreign policy motive became so strong that it brought legislation directing the President to enlist the cooperation of other nations in enacting controls on trade with the Soviet block to parallel those of the United States. The benefits of the various economic and military aid programs were to be withheld from non-cooperating nations, as in the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951.
Background.
"Moral embargo".
The Act was seen as a codified "moral embargo", in that it was an expression of moral outrage, in this instance, stemming from the Japanese bombing of civilians in mainland China in the late 1930s. In June 1938, the U.S. Secretary of State, Cordell Hull on June, 1938 condemned the slaughter and its "material encouragement". A month later, the Department of State notified aircraft manufacturers and exporters that the United States Government was "strongly opposed" to the sale of airplanes and related materiel to those nations using airplanes to attack civilian populations.
In 1939, the non-binding embargo was extended to materials essential to airplane manufacture and to plans, plants, and technical information for the production of high-quality aviation gasoline. These measures resulted in the suspension of the export to Japan of aircraft, aeronautical equipment, and other materials within the scope of the moral embargoes. As Japanese purchases of items other than aircraft and aeronautical equipment were minuscule, the moral embargo ultimately stopped the exportation of arms to Japan.
End of commercial treaties.
Following the failure of diplomatic efforts to protect endangered American lives, rights and economic interests in China, America considered commercial retaliation against Japan. by Japanese authorities or Japanese-sponsored agents in China. The American government felt that its 1911 commercial treaty with Japan was not affording an appropriate level of protection to U.S. commerce in areas within or occupied by Japan. Simultaneously, Japan's position under the treaty as a most favoured nation legally prevented the adoption of retaliatory measures against Japanese commerce. When the United States gave six-month notice of its withdrawal from the treaty in July, 1939, it removed the primary legal obstacle for embargo.
Effects.
The embargo, which halted the shipment of material such as airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline, was designed to be an unfriendly act, but expanding it to include oil was specifically avoided. Japan was dependent on U.S. oil, and it was thought at the time that such would be a provocative step.
The Act was expanded in September of that year to include iron and steel scrap, an act that Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi warned Secretary Hull on October 8, 1940 might be considered an "unfriendly act".
Controls were first authorized in 1940 in regard to munitions and similar materials essential to the defense effort, and extended in 1942 to all commodities. Always intended to be only temporary, the 1940 act was successfully extended in 1944, 1945, 1946 and 1947.
Retaliation.
The United States was not alone in its concern. Great Britain, which maintained colonies in the Far East also feared an aggressive Japan. Immediately following the enactment of the Act, the British ambassador would be asked by Japan to close the Burma Road, a key supply route of arms for China. Britain initially refused the request, but for a short period of time closed the road. The British and the Dutch followed suit in embargoing trade to Japan from their colonies in southeast Asia.
The ending of the commercial trade treaties further eroded the possibilities for dialogue between the two nations. Noted political economist Robert Higgs points out:
Robert Stinnett notes in his book, "Day Of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor", that America had broken the Japanese diplomatic code and knew that due to the pressure exerted by the Export Control Act, war was quickly becoming an inevitable outcome. He points to a deciphered communiqué between Foreign Minister Teijiro Toyoda and Ambassador Kichisaburō Nomura on July 31: “Commercial and economic relations between Japan and third countries, led by England and the United States, are gradually becoming so horribly strained that we cannot endure it much longer. Consequently, our Empire, to save its very life, must take measures to secure the raw materials of the South Seas.”
Post World War II use.
After World War II, the Export Control Act was expanded to prevent the diversion of advanced technology to the Soviet bloc and China and, in later years, to alter the behavior of foreign countries. Scarcity of certain goods in the world markets made continuance of controls necessary in order to prevent a drain on such goods from plentiful American supplies, with its consequential inflationary influence. It was envisioned that remaining controls would soon disappear at the time of re-enactment in 1949, but national security and foreign policy, especially following the outbreak of the Korean War, were new and compelling reasons for extending the Export Control Act of 1949 in 1951, 1953, 1956 and again in 1958. The Export Control Act of 1949 is an example of the type of legislation that it renders, subject to the regulations promulgated under it, all persons wherever situated. Under its provisions exports of scarce materials are controlled both from an economic standpoint—short supply and consequent inflationary effect on foreign demand; and the security standpoint-- autarchy and self-sufficiency in strategic resources not available in sufficiently large quantities. These are both domestic policies aimed primarily at conditions within the United States, but controls are also directed at conditions outside the country as an instrument of foreign policy. This is exemplified by the restrictions on export of certain strategic or military items to the Soviet bloc or to other countries which it felt, if permitted, would be detrimental to the foreign policy program of the US. This latter motive became so strong that it brought legislation directing the President to enlist the cooperation of other nations in enacting controls on trade with the Soviet block to parallel those of the United States. The benefits of the various economic and military aid programs were to be withheld from non-cooperating nations.

Emanuel von Friedrichsthal

Emanuel von Friedrichsthal (January 12, 1809 – March 3, 1842) was an Austrian traveler, daguerreotypist, botanist, and amateur archaeologist, who traveled through the Balkans and in Central America and documented his findings.
Von Friedrichsthal was born on the family estate Urschitz near Brünn, in the Austrian Empire (now Brno, Czech Republic). He was educated in Vienna at the Theresian Military Academy and entered Austrian government service, but soon left to pursue scientific travels. He traveled to Greece and European Turkey in the 1830s, publishing his findings in two books: "Reise in die südlichen Theile von Griechenland" ("Journey to the Southern Parts of Greece", 1838) and "Serbiens Neuzeit in geschichtlicher, politischer, topographischer, statistischer und naturhistorischer Hinsicht" ("Modern Serbia in Historical, Political, Topographical, Statistical, and Natural-Historical Respects", 1840). These publications acquired for him in particular a reputation in botany for their descriptions of the flora of Greece and Serbia.
In 1840 he was posted as first secretary of the Austrian Legation to Mexico, where he became interested exploring the ruins of Maya civilization after reading the writings of John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood. He discussed his plans with historian William H. Prescott during a trip to Boston, and bought a daguerreotype apparatus in New York City. He went to the Yucatán in mid-1840, and traveled throughout the Yucatán and Chiapas, becoming the first person to take daguerreotypes of the Mayan ruins, and the first European in the 19th century to visit the ruins of Chichen Itza.
He fell ill during his travels, probably with malaria, which necessitated his return to Europe in 1841, where he died in Vienna in 1842. This early death prevented him from publishing the results of his Central-American travels, but he had put on an exhibition of twenty-five daguerreotypes in New York, in the British Museum in London and in Paris, for which he was honored by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres.

Career.
Loembe began his career with Academy Delta and joined in summer 2007 to AS Douanes. He has turned down offers from top notch teams in Ghana like Accra Hearts of Oak, Tema Youth and league debutantes Bechem Chelsea, saying he is attracted to Kumasi Asante Kotoko because of their youth team, prospects in the CAF Champions League. On 5 November 2008, he featured for Kumasi Asante Kotoko in a trial match against King Faisal Babes in Memory of the late Honour Kwadwo Baah-Wiredu at the Baba Yara Stadium which Kotoko lost by a lone goal to a King Faisal side that had the entire 1st team squad except Goalkeeper Osei Boateng and Ebo 'Nani' Andoh of Black Starlets fame. He played excellently at the heart of the defence throughout the entire 90 minutes of the game which impressed the Technical handlers of Kotoko led by Coach Bashiru Hayford.
International career.
Loembe made his national debut for the Young Hawks of Togo in the AFCON U-17 TOGO 2007 on 10 March 2007 at the Stade de Kege in Lomé and played for the entire 90 minutes of the game against South Africa which the Young Hawks won 2-0. He could have captained the squad but for his lack of fluency in French, the team's communication language; he speaks fluently in English, Twi, Ga, Hausa and a little French. Loembe marshalled the defence like the captain of the team throughout the entire tournament and together with his teammates went on to the final, but lost 0-1 to Nigeria, a pre-tournament favourite and eventual winners of FIFA U-17 World Cup KOREA 2007.
On 24 August 2007, Loembe starred for the Young Hawks of Togo in their maiden 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup tournament in South Korea against Costa Rica and played the entire group matches against Peru and Korea. He played 90 minutes in all these matches.
He was called into the Local Hawks of Togo CHAN team (The African Nations Championships is a new tournament designed by CAF for only home-based players of its member countries) that faced Ghana in Accra on 4 and 13 May 2008.
He made his debut for the senior national team on 10 August 2011 in a friendly match against Niger, and was included in the squad for the next match, a 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Botswana.

Joseph Colton, the original G.I. Joe, is a fictional character from ', a line of military-themed toys created by Hasbro. He also appeared as a character later in the , but did not appear in any of the animated series. He is portrayed by Bruce Willis in the film '.
Profile.
Joseph B. Colton graduated with the highest honors from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1960. An expert marksman, he was recruited by Special Forces, and later became a Green Beret. During service overseas, he participated in numerous combat operations, but saw minimal acknowledgment, as his missions were "ultra" classified. In 1963, he was appointed by then-President John F. Kennedy to create and command an "ULTIMATE freedom fighting force." It was at this time that he received the code name G.I. Joe.
He later "retired" from active military duty, and was placed as the head of a secret Strategic Defense Initiative installation in New York City. There he served with the lead scientist, G.I. Jane, who originally maintained cover as a combat nurse.
Toys.
"G.I. Joe" was first released in 1994, as a mail-in exclusive for the 30th Anniversary of G.I. Joe. Based on the version of G.I. Joe from 1964, the figure was available in limited stock. Due to unanticipated orders, Hasbro sold out of the figures and no more were produced, eventually leading Hasbro to mail an apology.
He was not released again until 2006, this time as part of a multi-figure pack, the "Viper Lockdown". This version of the G.I. Joe was made up of parts from different figures, and is not a separate mold. Overall, he has had 2 releases using a total of 2 different molds.
He was also released in the 12 inch line in 1994, as an homage to his original figure released in 1964.
Comics.
Marvel Comics.
General Joseph Colton made very few appearances during the original "G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero" series. In issue #86, he is working with his old colleague Jane in a secure level in the Chrysler Building. The laboratories are attacked by Cobra forces, which desire the orbital pulsed weapon system hidden inside. Joe, Jane and a small squad of official G.I. Joe forces (including Repeater and Lightfoot) defeat the Cobra soldiers.
In issue #127, General Colton explains the Rapid Pulse Electron Beam (RPEB) to Duke and Stalker. He discovers a tap into the control system, leading to a telephone switching station in New Jersey, where Cobra Commander has taken charge. Realizing that their systems are breached, General Colton has Jane shut down all systems. General Colton, Duke, Stalker and Wild Bill then head to the phone switching station, but Cobra shoots down the Joes Tomahawk, and Cobra Commander escapes, rushing to New York City and the RPEB. General Colton, Stalker and Duke use Battle Copters to fly back to the Chrysler Building, but Cobra Commander has already taken control of the RPEB, and uses it to eliminate a drug shipment by Headman. Cobra Commander and his crew then use civilian disguises to walk undetected past the Joes.
General Colton also appears in issue #152, where he is called back to active duty for a secret mission. Ace is assigned to deliver Colton to D.C., and asks Colton when the last time he was in the back seat of a combat jet. This prompts Colton to reminisce about his earlier years in battle, leading to a flashback story about the original plan to form a G.I. Joe team.
Devil's Due Publishing.
"G.I. Joe: Frontline".
The first four issues of Devil's Due Publishing's "G.I. Joe: Frontline" featured Larry Hama's story of one last mission, "The Mission That Never Was." After the official disbandment of the G.I. Joe team they hold one last mission. They had to transport the Rapid Pulse Particle Beam from Florida to Colton's location in New York City. During this series, Colton is stationed in the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).
Reinstatement.
General Colton appears later in the series. He comes out of retirement to lead the G.I. Joe Team, after Hawk is paralyzed by Cobra Commander. His leadership is temporary, as he is quickly sidelined by the cabal of Generals known as the Jugglers who instead want General Philip Rey to lead the team.
Colton becomes a target when the Red Shadows began going after G.I. Joe and Cobra agents. He is shot and apparently killed by the Red Shadow's leader, Wilder Vaughn, a man Colton once knew. The injuries are critical, but Colton survives.
America’s Elite.
After a year of disbandment, General Colton is asked by the president to head a much smaller G.I. Joe team in the absence of Hawk. He is reluctant, but accepts the position, and leads the Joes from their new headquarters, a secret facility known as The Rock.
At the end of the series, he is able to convince the president that G.I. Joe is still needed. With Hawk at his side, he leads a fully restored and recognized G.I. Joe team into battle, to find all Cobra members still at large after the events of "World War III".
Alternate realities and continuities.
General Colton has made one appearance as a major character outside of the main G.I. Joe continuity.
"G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers: Black Horizon" (Vol. 4).
During this fourth miniseries, Hawk discovered G.I. Joe was being held captive by the forces of Cobra-La in the Himalayas. Along with his team, Joe was captured by the Decepticons in 1978. He later escaped to help Hawk and Optimus Prime defeat Cobra-La.
"G.I. Joe: Retaliation".
General Colton is portrayed by Bruce Willis in ', the sequel to '. The movie was released on March 28, 2013 through collaboration of Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In the film, General Colton has one of George S. Patton's M-1911 pistols.

Dudley Leavitt (publisher)

Dudley Leavitt (1772 – September 20, 1851) was an American publisher. He was an early graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy in his native town of Exeter, New Hampshire, and later moved to Gilmanton where he first edited a newspaper and taught school. Within a few years, Leavitt relocated to Meredith, where in addition to teaching school and farming, he began publishing in 1797 Leavitt's Farmers Almanack, one of the nation's earliest farmers almanacs. A polymath, Leavitt poured his knowledge of disparate fields including mathematics, language and astronomy into the wildly popular almanacs, which outlived their creator, being published until 1896. The inaugural issue of 1797 carried the title of "The New England Calendar: Or, Almanack for the Year of Our Lord 1797". On the cover was the disclaimer that the new publication was "Calculated for the Meridian of Concord, Latitude 43° 14' N. Longitude 72° 45' W.: And with But Little Variation Will Answer for Any of the New England States."
Youth and early career.
Dudley Leavitt was born at Exeter, the oldest child of farmer and landowner Joshua Leavitt and Elizabeth (née James). He was named after Governor Thomas Dudley, the second colonial governor of Massachusetts, from whom both parents descended. The descendant of early Exeter settlers, his father Joshua moved from Exeter to Deerfield early in Dudley Leavitt's life. After attending Exeter Academy, where he graduated in 1790, Leavitt married Judith Glidden of Gilmanton in 1794, and he and his new wife took up residence in the town, where he had family. In Gilmanton, Leavitt began studying Latin and Greek under Rev. Isaac Smith. In 1802 Leavitt also served as a selectman for the town.
Leavitt's first love was mathematics and astronomy. Something of a pure scientist, Leavitt contributed scientific papers to societies until the end of his life, often having to do with astronomy and physics. The annual conventions of the American Philosophical Society often heard presentations of the latest of Leavitt's findings. Nor were Leavitt's the musings of some crackpot New Hampshire hermit. In an 1811 paper concerning astronomy addressed to the President and membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, for instance, Leavitt outlined his "New and short Method of calculating the times of the First and Last Quarters of the Moon".
But with his scholarly inquiries and meager publishing income, Leavitt turned to teaching to supplement his income. In 1800 he founded the "Gilmanton Gazette", a local weekly newspaper in Gilmanton, as well as the "Farmer's Weekly Magazine" for two years with a partner in the newly established publishing house of "Leavitt & Clough." Leavitt's foray into newspaper publishing was an apparent failure, but he was pioneer of the industry in the state. The presses used to print his early broadsheet were purchased by the proprietors of the new "Concord Gazette" in 1806, who paid to have the presses lugged from Gilmanton to Concord on a two-horse wagon so they could begin printing one of the capital's earliest newspapers, and the only competitor of "The New Hampshire Patriot".
Discouraged with the economics of newspaper publishing, Leavitt and his wife decided to move to Meredith in 1819. Pursuing another avenue of work, Leavitt ran an advertisement in the Concord "Observer" newspaper announcing that he was opening the "Meredith Academick School". The new school, its headmaster announced, would "offer instruction in the various grades usually taught in academies... No pains will be spared on the part of the instructor to render the acquisition of useful knowledge easy and pleasant to those young gentlemen and ladies who may attend the School."
The "reasonable" board would cost $3.00 for each quarter's enrolment, Leavitt announced in his initial advertisement, and would cover most fields of study, except "Algebra, Navigation, Gunnery, or the Science of Projectiles, &c., Spherick Geometry & Trigonometry, Astronomy & Philosophy." For study in those more complicated fields Leavitt proposed to charge an additional 50 cents tuition for each quarter of enrolment. Around Meredith the new schoolmaster became known as "Old Master Leavitt".
Leavitt settled on his Meredith farm near Center Harbor, less than a mile from Lake Winnipesaukee, where he held his classes. He was known as a stern taskmaster who did not suffer fools, or wisecracking students. But Leavitt had enough of a sense of whimsy that he handpainted panels of "Award of Merit" to those students he felt met his stringent guidelines. (Leavitt never gave up teaching, even when busying himself with his almanac and other projects. He taught school into his 70s, and it was customary in New Hampshire for successful men to boast that they had been educated by Leavitt.)
When not teaching, he was to be found farming his or immersed in study. Stories were legion of Leavitt so immersed in reading or study that he was oblivious to nearly everything around him. And the scholar Leavitt was no gentleman farmer. Aside from having edited a newspaper devoted to agriculture, Leavitt raised cattle on his small farm and toiled long hours when not teaching or writing.
Out of the confluence of Leavitt's scholarly interests, his former career as a newspaper writer and publisher, and his work as an author of textbooks was born the idea behind his farmer's almanac, which he first began publishing while living in Gilmanton. From the beginning, Leavitt demonstrated an unrelenting common sense, as well as a sly sense of humor. In an early edition of his almanacs, for instance, Leavitt included an illustration of a New Hampshireman struggling against the elements. Quoting a supposed poem of the 17th century, Leavitt wrote, in lines summoning feelings familiar to current Granite State residents, "Our mountains and hills and our vallies (sic) below; Being commonly cover'd with ice and with snow; And when the north-west wind with violence blows, Then every man pulls his cap over his nose; But if any's so hardy, and will it withstand, He forfeits a finger, a foot or a hand."
Leavitt continued to publish the eponymous almanac after he moved to Meredith. He had already founded a newspaper in 1811, while still living in Gilmanton, which he called "The New Hampshire Register", which he continued publishing for several years (1811–17). The "Register" became well-known thanks to Leavitt's habit of printing brief synopses of historical events. On the side, between farming, teaching school, publishing his newspaper, Leavitt wrote and published at least eight textbooks on mathematics, grammar, astronomy, geography and music, including an edition of Nicolas Pike's widely distributed "A New and Complete System of Arithmetic" in 1826, as well as the staple textbooks of teachers across the nation "The Scholar's Review" and "Teacher's Daily Assistant". The scores of textbooks produced by Leavitt, a dizzying array of titles down the years, including "Complete Directions for Parsing the English Language; Or, The Rules of Grammar Made Easy: Being a New Grammatical Essay, Designed as a Supplement to Lindley Murray's Grammar, for the Use of Students as Soon as They Begin to Parse", make one wonder where Leavitt found the time.
The new almanac takes off.
But the almanac, which he dubbed "Leavitt's Farmers' Almanack and Miscellaneous Yearbook", became such a success that after a while Leavitt shelved many of his other activities to focus on it. The once-farfetched idea was a runaway hit. By 1846, for instance, Leavitt's almanacs were selling some 60,000 copies for that year's two editions – a tremendous number for the era.
What Leavitt seized on, probably because of his interest in astronomy, was something every New Englander knew: that the weather was topic number one.
Ultimately the schoolteacher and part-time farmer Leavitt came to be seen as 'Leavitt the almanac-maker,' as he was often referred to in his day, and in the ultimate tribute, his once-anonymous almanacs came to carry the creator's name. In an early instance of 'brand identity', by 1824 the almanacs carried the title of "Leavitt's New-England Farmer's Almanack". During his era, improbably enough, Dudley Leavitt was as close to a celebrity as the times produced. "Through his almanacs," noted Joseph Walker, as close a biographer as the almanac-compiler ever had, "(Leavitt) was probably known to more persons in New Hampshire than any other man."
The aura of celebrity around Leavitt was such, wrote Henry McFarland in his "Sixty Years in Concord and Elsewhere", that "stage-drivers pointed out his house to passengers as that of a person of great renown... I remember him as a courtly man with gentle manners." John F. Brown, a local printer for whom McFarland worked, published Leavitt's almanacs, paying the unheard-of sum, said McFarland, of "$100 for the copy."
Leavitt aimed the almanacs at the general population of New England, supplying tips on everything from farming to the weather to astronomy. As word spread about the publication, readership jumped, and the publication became a fixture throughout the region. The almanacs were sold at general stores, and later at grocery stores and drug stores. Leavitt was aided in some of the almanac's calculations geared towards agriculture by his nephew, astronomer William B. Leavitt.
The almanac's entry of September 6, 1881, for instance, published after the founder's death, demonstrated the detailed observation of natural phenomena which marked the publication. "Tuesday, September 6, 1881, was remarkable over the whole of New England and may be known as Yellow Day. It was so dark in many places that artificial light was needed for the common acts of indoor life. Without, the dense curtains of smoke or dry fog that shut out the sun, gave a peculiar yellow hue to the atmosphere, changing the color of the trees and grass, perplexing the birds and other animals and seriously frightening the superstitious. It will long be remembered."
Despite his descent from Puritan John Leavitt, founding deacon of Old Ship Church, America's oldest in continuous use, Dudley Leavitt was a skeptic. Perhaps it was his academic and scientific nature, but Leavitt was known throughout the Meredith area for his scoffing at religion. At one session of evening prayer, for instance, Leavitt's wife offered up a fervent prayer that her husband scholar be saved. When she was done, Leavitt got up, put on his hat and said "We read in God's word, that the unbelieving husband shall be justified by the prayers of the believing wife," and marched out of the church.
Leavitt's death and legacy.
Leavitt died at his farm in Meredith on September 20, 1851. At the time of his death, Leavitt had the upcoming issue of his almanac at the press, and another five years' worth of issues of his almanac written, calculated and ready for the printer. The feat was so impressive to fellow writers and printers that one contemporary journal was moved to declare: "This is a degree of punctuality, of which there are few examples, especially in the editorship of a periodical work."
"The New York Times" carried news of the death of the man who had become something of a quiet sensation, known for the paper almanacs which hung by cords in family kitchens across New England. "Dudley Leavitt, the veteran almanac maker, died this morning", noted The Times. "His age was 80." Leavitt was buried in the Leavitt private burial ground on the family farm near his home.
His beloved almanac, for which he did all the calculations and writing, outlived him. It continued to be published in Concord until 1896 – 45 years after its founder's death. William B. Leavitt edited the publication following his father's death.
Leavitt's publication, notes the New Hampshire historical marker delineating the site of Leavitt's farm and school, "provided information vital to domestic and agricultural life of the period. He lived in a house 200 yards east." The almanac was one of the longest-running such publications in the history of the nation. The Old Farmer's Almanac, which first appeared in 1792, five years ahead of Leavitt's almanac, was the Meredith schoolteacher's chief competitor, and has been published continuously ever since – making it the oldest continuously published periodical in North America.
The New Hampshire Historical Society in Concord owns a painting of Dudley Leavitt, to which local citizens contributed towards the purchase, including former Governor Charles H. Bell and diplomat George G. Fogg, both of whom were connected to Leavitt through his Gilman ancestors. Leavitt and his wife had 11 children, two of whom married Congregational missionaries to Thailand.

Tropical green building

Tropical Green Building refers to a style of construction that focuses on energy reduction, reduced use of chemicals, and supporting local labor and community. This requires close cooperation of the design team, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages, from site selection, scheme formation, material selection and procurement, to project implementation. Tropical Green Building has the same basis as green building in more temperate climates, but the methods of construction are completely different. In the tropics, the focus is on keeping cool, preventing insect infestations, and reduced mould, damp and maintenance in the home.
Generally, tropical green building also seeks to reduce power consumption through intelligent architecture, such as by allowing in lots of natural light so that electric lights aren't needed during the daytime, and at night, using white-painted roofs, ceilings and low-energy light bulbs such as compact fluorescents or LED lamps.
Solar power, wind power, and/or the use of micro hydro are often deployed, but not always the focus of tropical green building.

Konárovice

Konárovice is a municipality "(obec)" in the Kolín District of the Czech Republic.
History.
The first mention of Konárovice is from the time of the reign of Boleslaus II. of 976 – 999, who gave the surroundings of Kolín to his youngest son Oldřich. Prince Oldřich built a castle where the village of Přehráď now stands, and called it Oldřiš.
Konárovice was previously called Koňařovice. It is thought that in the 10th century there was a horseman living here, who belonged to the princely officials close to the castle and who bred the horses for the prince on the large meadows of Labe. The prince was not only a militant and power-greedy man, but also a great lover of hunting. He settled more servants in the vicinity – they kept sheep in Ovčáry, cattle in Bychory, hound dogs in Ohaře and birds of pray in Jestřábí Lhota, Kánín and Sokoleč.
The first written mention of the village is from the year 1352 in the registration of the Pope's tithes. In that time Konárovice had already been established as a knight's stronghold. The town's church was mentioned for the first time in 1358.
In the following centuries the owners of Konárovice often changed. In 1772 a farm was bought at auction by the Countess Elizabeth de Quasco. She used it as a summer residence and in 1775 rebuilt the chateau into its present form. Later in the year she ordered the building of a new parish house, but records of the first parish priest date only from 1820. Under control of the Countess, education flourished; in 1810 the 1st ordinary school was opened in Konárovice.
During this same period mulberry gardens were planted in Konárovice for the purpose of silk manufacturing. This trade became very successful, reaching its greatest flowering around 1820.
In 1856 Jan Nepomuk, Count of Harrach, engraving master and chamberlain, gained Konárovice and brought the local economy to its greatest prosperity. He then sold the entire estate to Josef Götzl, manufacturer and magistrate of Karlin. His family was often visited by violinist Jan Kocian, who held a small concert there.
Konárovice state bordered Bychory state, where the famous Czech violinist Jan Kubelík owned a castle.
The village includes a settlement, "Jelen", where a brewery and a large restaurant were built in the 14th century. It also has a recreational settlement, "Včelín", which has its own interesting history. Its name was derived from the beekeeping and the museum which was opened in 1928.
Winery.
On the sunny slopes of Konárovice grapes have been cultivated since time immemorial. On one hill in Konárovice – "Na Vinici" - the last vineyard of the region was preserved until the beginning of the 20th century. Since 1995, the vineyards gradually have been renewed.
The soil is mainly clay, with loess and diluvian metal. Both land and location are suitable for cultivation of grapes, peaches and apricots.
The average annual temperature is 9.3°C; the sum of annual precipitation is around 650 mm.
The climate is very similar to that of Southern Moravian (e.g. Velkopavlovická, 9.33°C), suitable for the production of good wine. The most common current wine plantings are Moravian Muscat, Rhine Riesling, Pinot blanc and Aurelius.
Sightseeing.
Near Konárovice there is a village called Žehušice, with the last white deer preserve in the world, and an Empire-era chateau called Kačina.
In the village of Konárovice there are several protected objects:
A chateau (owned by American actor Crispin Glover) and a church can also be found in Konárovice.

Demon in a Bottle

"Demon in a Bottle" is a nine-issue story arc from the comic book series "The Invincible Iron Man" (vol. 1), published in issues 120 through 128 in 1979 by Marvel Comics. It was written by David Michelinie and Bob Layton and illustrated by John Romita, Jr., Bob Layton, and Carmine Infantino. "Demon in a Bottle" is concerned with Tony Stark's alcoholism.
Publication history.
The storyline ran in "Iron Man" #120-128 (March-Nov. 1979), plotted by David Michelinie and Bob Layton, with script by Michelinie. John Romita, Jr. pencilled the breakdown sketches, with Layton providing finished art. Issue #122 (May 1979) was both plotted and scripted by Michelinie, penciled by Carmine Infantino and inked by Layton.
"Demon in a Bottle" was originally only the title of the final issue in the storyline. When the storyline was collected in trade paperback in 1984 and 1989, it was published under the title "The Power of Iron Man". "Demon in a Bottle" later became the popular name for the storyline, and collected editions were then published under that title.
Plot summary.
A military tank hurled through the air strikes the wing of a passenger plane carrying Tony Stark. Stark secretly dons the Iron Man armor he carries in his briefcase, flies out of the plane, and guides it to a safe landing in the ocean. Navy ships approach and soldiers help the passengers to safety, and bring Iron Man to an island base. They tell him the tank was thrown by Namor, who was defending a resident of the island that the soldiers were trying to remove, because the island is used as a toxic waste disposal site. Iron Man confronts and fights Namor, before it's revealed that the soldiers actually belong to the Roxxon Oil Corporation, which is secretly occupying the island to mine the vibranium it contains. Iron Man and Namor team up to fight and defeat the soldiers, who escape and trigger explosives contained on the island, destroying it along with any evidence that they were ever there.
While flying home, Iron Man's armor begins to malfunction, sending him flying uncontrollably through the sky and crash landing. He regains control and later tests the armor in his lab, and finds nothing apparently wrong. Stark is visiting a casino with Bethany Cabe when Blizzard, the Melter, and Whiplash arrive and attempt to rob the casino's vault. Stark slips away, dons his armor, and battles and defeats the villains. During the fight, he overhears a comment from Blizzard about "Hammer" wanting Iron Man kept alive. Stark later receives and agrees to a request for Iron Man to represent his company, Stark International, at a public ceremony and meet with a foreign ambassador. At the ceremony, Iron Man's armor again malfunctions, striking the ambassador with a repulsor blast, killing him. Iron Man tells the police about the malfunction, claiming he did not intentionally kill the ambassador. Doubtful, but knowing they can't fight him, the police let him go but demand that Stark turn over his armor for inspection, and Stark complies. During this time, Stark's drinking increases significantly.
Stark meets with the Avengers, agreeing to their request that Iron Man temporarily step down as their leader, and asks for and receives hand-to-hand fight training from Captain America. He then meets with Scott Lang, the second Ant-Man, and asks him to sneak into the prison where Whiplash is being held to get information on the person named Hammer. Stark uses the information and flies to Monaco with James Rhodes to investigate. Hammer is alerted to their presence and sends soldiers to attack them. They are both knocked unconscious; Stark is taken prisoner and Rhodes is left in public and arrested by the local police when he awakens. When Stark awakens he is confronted by Justin Hammer, who reveals that he has been responsible for Iron Man's armor malfunctions. Angered that he lost a lucrative bid to Stark International, Hammer, with the aid of scientists in his employ, took control of Iron Man's armor and forced him to kill the ambassador in an attempt to ruin the reputation of the company. Stark attempts to escape Hammer's compound by climbing over a wall, but sees that he is on a giant floating island at sea.
Imprisoned, Stark escapes when he attacks a guard after fooling him into opening the door. Hammer learns of Stark's escape and orders the supervillains he keeps in his employ (including Constrictor, the Beetle, Man-Killer, Water Wizard, Discus, Stiletto, Porcupine, and Leap-Frog) to find him. The supervillains find Stark, who has found the confiscated briefcase containing his spare armor and suited up. Iron Man battles and defeats the villains, then goes after Hammer. Rhodes has convinced the police of his story and the island is attacked by police helicopters. Hammer escapes, and Iron Man flies into the air and crashes down, damaging the island and causing it to sink. Stark returns home and continues binge drinking, and drunkenly yells at his butler, Edwin Jarvis. Jarvis resigns the next day.
Continuing to drink to forget his problems, Stark is confronted by Beth, who tells him about her former husband, who became addicted to drugs, which ended their relationship and eventually killed him. Stark admits to his drinking problem and accepts Beth's offer to help him to quit drinking and help him through withdrawal. Stark then apologizes to and renews his working relationship with Jarvis. He learns that Jarvis's mother is sick and offers to pay for her medical costs, but learns that Jarvis has sold the two shares of stock he owned in Stark International that were preventing S.H.I.E.L.D. from buying a controlling interest in his company. The story ends with Stark optimistic about the future, conquering his alcoholism and determined to retrieve the stocks and maintain control over his company.
Creation.
Writer/artist Bob Layton said of the story: "I'm gonna quote David Michelinie here, that it was never our intention to do anything relevant. We were paid to, basically, do the next episode of "Iron Man". just [that in that particular issue, alcoholism was the bad guy. Instead of Doctor Doom or somebody like that, it was the bottle. That was our villain of the month. And that's really the way we treated it. We built everything up to that. But the point of it is, it was never... we never attempted to be relevant. It just... in the corporate world, what gets to guys? What causes the downfall? Usually it's greed, or it's sex and drugs, right? Well, we couldn't do the sex part, right? Alcohol wasn't talked about all that much, really, to be honest with you. Especially with kids, you know, in that particular era. But, you know, we treated it as we intended to, as the bad guy."
Reception and legacy.
"Demon in a Bottle" has been recognized by critics as "the quintessential Iron Man story," "one of the best super-hero sagas of the 1970s," and "one which continues to influence writers of the character today." The storyline won a 1980 Eagle Award for "Favorite Single Comic Book Story." Praising Michelinie's "clever" writing and Romita and Layton's "highly distinguishable" artwork, J. Montes of the Weekly Comic Book Review said, "Iron Man was never known for having engaging stories, but in this one rare case it happened and that is why we treasure it." Montes felt it was "a bit silly to see recover from [the effects of his alcoholism over the course of one issue," but added that "there's no mistaking the losses and struggles he deals with." 
D.K. Latta of Pulp and Dagger praised Michelinie for "deliversmart writing and plausible, grown up characters that are a pleasure to read and a rich tapestry of plot threads" and "avoid[ing the preachy, holier-than-thou route, and instead just tella story that happens to concern a costumed super-hero getting a little...lost." Latta found Romita's pencil art "problematic" but added that "Bob Layton's inks help a lot." Win Wiacek of Now Read This! said, "The fall and rise of a hero is a classic plot, and it’s seldom been better used in the graphic narrative medium and never bettered in the super-hero field. An adult and very mature tale for kids of all ages, it is an unforgettable instance of triumph and tragedy perfectly told."
Jamie Hailstone of Den of Geek said that "some of the storytelling and the portrayal of Tony Stark as a millionaire playboy may be a little hackneyed," but praised the storyline for "the character a much needed injection of reality." Hailstone said Romita's artwork is "as good as anything in his long career," and concluded that "while it might not deal with the consequences of addiction in the same powerful ways as films like "French Connection II" — this is a comic, after all — having re-read the tale almost 20 years on, it holds up amazingly well." Dave Wallace of the Comics Bulletin said the issues "are too generic and unremarkable to really stand up as great stories today," but said that "each issue is a satisfying story in its own right" and praised "the strong storytelling instincts that are evident from the composition of [Romita's] panels."
Stark's alcoholism was revisited in later storylines, and remains a defining element of the character. 
Films.
Jon Favreau, director of the 2008 "Iron Man" film, said: "Stark has issues with booze. That's part of who he is." Favreau said that elements of the story would be used in future "Iron Man" sequels: "I don't think we'll ever do the "Leaving Las Vegas" version, but it will be dealt with." In "Iron Man 2", Favearu notes that the scene of Tony drunkenly carousing during a party in his armor at his residence until Col. James Rhodes intervenes is the closest he intended to adapt the "Demon in a Bottle" storyline. Shane Black wanted to use the Demon in a Bottle storyline for "Iron Man 3", but Disney/Marvel don't want to use the storyline due of the kids watching the film.

William Romaine Callender

William Romaine Callender (junior) (1825 – 22 January 1876) was a British businessman and Conservative politician.
He was the son of William Romaine Callender of Mauldeth Hall near Manchester and his wife, Hannah Pope of London. W. R. Callender senior was a prominent Whig and non-conformist in the area who campaigned for the incorporation of Manchester as a municipal borough, and served on the first town council. His son, however, became a leading Conservative and Anglican. In 1849 he married Hannah Mayson.
He entered his father's business as a cotton spinner and merchant in Manchester, eventually taking charge. He expanded the firm by the purchase of that of Sir Thomas Bazley in Bolton in 1861. Apart from his business activities he was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and a strong supporter of the Manchester Athenaeum, which was founded by wealthy businessmen for the education and recreation of the working classes. In 1858 he was appointed honorary secretary of the Athenaeum, a position he held until his death. He also assisted in the formation of a company of rifle volunteers in 1859. He was a freemason, and rose to be Deputy Grand Master of the Provincial Lodge of East Lancashire, and Grand Master of the Mark Masons of England.
He was elected as a member of the first Manchester School Board in 1870, and in 1874 as one of three members of parliament for the Parliamentary Borough of Manchester, defeating the Liberal MP, Jacob Bright.
In November 1875 Callender fell ill after attending an Orange Order demonstration, and was advised to travel to the south coast to aid his recovery. However, he died of "rheumatic neuralgia" at St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, in January 1876, aged 51. A bust of the late MP was unveiled at Manchester City Hall in 1880.

Elsässische Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden

The Elsässischen Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden (Alsatian Engineering Company in Grafenstaden) was a heavy industry firm located at Grafenstaden in the Alsace, near the city of Strasbourg.
In 1826, André Koechlin founded the engineering works of Andre Koechlin & Cie in Mulhouse, which made steam engines, turbines, spinning and weaving machinery and, from 1839, steam locomotives too. The subsequent history of the firm is closely linked to the history of Alsace-Lorraine. After losing the Franco-Prussian war of 1870/71, France had to withdraw from the so-called "Reichsland" and cede it to the German Empire. As a result, the company, now called the "Elsässische Maschinenbaugesellschaft Andreas Köchlin & Cie." in Mülhausen and the "Maschinenwerkstätte Rollé & Schwillgué" in Strassburg-Grafenstaden found themselves inside the German Empire. In 1872 the two factories were merged into the "Elsässischen Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden".
The scale-making factory of "Rollé & Schwillgué", that predominantly made decimal weighing equipment based on the 1921 patent of a Benedictine monk, was bought in 1837 by the Strasbourg engineering company, which transferred the workshop with its work force of 40 employees one year later to Grafenstaden, a few kilometres south of Strasbourg. In 1846 they began the manufacture of tenders, and from 1856 locomotives as well.
After the takeover of Alsace-Lorraine by the German Empire in 1871, many Alsatians who considered themselves to be Frenchmen moved to the area around Belfort where, in 1872, the Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (Alsatian Mechanical Engineering Company), SACM, was opened. After the peace treaty of Versailles in 1919 Alsace-Lorraine, and with it the Elsässische Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden, returned once more to France, where the Grafenstaden firm was merged with the SACM.
The factory in Belfort was worked until 1926 and taken over in 1928 by Thomson-Houston and Alsthom, the present-day firm of Alstom.
After the occupation of Alsace in 1941 the factory was forced to deliver Class 44 and Class 52 locomotives to the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft under the direction of the Magdeburger Werkzeugmaschinenfabrik (Magdeburg Machine Tool Factory), MWF. After World War II the factory was once again under French control.
In 1951 the first diesel locomotives were built in the factory and, in 1955, the manufacture of steam locomotives was halted. The production of diesel engines continued until 1965.
Production figures.
After the merger of the two factories a common works numbering system was introduced, beginning with the number 2118, because Köchlin had built 1,412 locomotives to that point and Grafenstaden 705 locomotives. The manufacture of steam engines ended with locomotive works number 8174. Because eleven works numbers were not used, the combined company SACM must have built 6,042 steam locomotives.
The diesel engines built from 1951 to 1965 were given their own numbers starting from 10001 and 20001. These locomotives were supplied to the Saar Railway amongst others, that later ended up in the Deutsche Bundesbahn. In the 10,000 range, mainly engines with a B-dh axle arrangement, the works number 10199 was reached. Of the 20,000 series, with a C-dh axle arrangement, only 23 engines were made.

Jim Lang (rugby player)

Jim Lang (1909–1991) was a Welsh international rugby union number 8 who played club rugby for Llanelli and Swansea. Whilst with Llanelli he faced two touring Southern Hemisphere teams, the South Africans in 1931 and New Zealand in 1935.
Rugby career.
Lang was first capped for Wales in the 1931 Five Nations Championship in a game against France. Under the captaincy of Jack Bassett, Wales won the game with ease, running in seven tries. Lang was reselected two weeks later to face the Irish at Ravenhill, and when Wales won the game they also won the tournament. Lang would remain unselected for his country for another four years, but in 1931 he played for Llanelli when they hosted the touring South Africans. Lang ran out against the Springboks with his brother, Will, but ended the game on the losing side.
In 1934 Lang was back in the Welsh team, adding some experience to a team which the game earlier with 13 new caps, had lost at home to England. Led by Claude Davey and with the flair supplied by Cliff Jones, Wales beat Scotland at Murrayfield. This game was the first of ten sequential games that Lang would play for Wales stretching to 1937. His most memorable game during this period was Wales's win against the touring New Zealand team in 1935. Having already faced, and lost, to the All Blacks with Llanelli, Lang found himself selected to face the tourists for his country. It was a memorable win for Wales in a match filled with drama, that saw Wales losing with ten minutes remaining and their hooker stretchered off with a broken neck, only for the Welsh team to rally for a narrow win. Lang played his part with strong line-out play that allowed Wales to gain from good possession.

THK-2

__NOTOC__
The THK-2 was a single-seat, single-engine aerobatic trainer aircraft developed in Turkey in 1944 intended as an advanced trainer for prospective fighter pilots. It was a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with an elliptical planform and of wooden construction. The cockpit was enclosed and the main units of the tailwheel undercarriage retracted backwards into the wing.
Designed by Polish engineers who had come to Turkey to help establish the Türk Hava Kurumu factory, the first prototype flew in 1944 and the second flew the following year. This led to production in series, but only four further examples were built before the project was abandoned. When THK was taken over by MKEK, this was one of the designs selected for further work. However, although the designation MKEK-2 was allocated, nothing further came of this. The THK-2s were used by the Turkish Air Force in their intended role until the mid-1950s.

Varsovienne

The varsovienne, also known as the varsouvienne or varsoviana, is a slow, graceful dance in ¾ time with an accented downbeat in alternate measures. It combines elements of the waltz, mazurka, and polka. The dance originated around 1850 in Warsaw, Poland. The words "varsovienne" and "varsoviana" are French and Spanish feminine adjectives, respectively, meaning 'from Warsaw'. The dance was popular in 19th-century America, where it was danced to the tune "Put Your Little Foot". It quickly became a favorite folk dance in the Scandinavian countries as well. The unique armhold by the same name – also known as the promenade hold – is used in other dance styles such as the American square dance, contra dance, and some ballroom dances. 
A varsoviana tune plays an important role in Tennessee Williams' play "A Streetcar Named Desire".

Chris Beardshaw

Chris Beardshaw is an award-winning British gardener, who is perhaps best known for his work on the BBC's long-running television series "Gardeners' World". 
Background.
Beardshaw is formally trained, and holds an M.A. in Landscape Architecture from the University of Gloucestershire. He has won several prestigious gardening awards, including, in 1999, a Gold Medal for his "Dig For Victory" garden and then again in 2012 working with a learning disability team from the Minstead Training Trust Chelsea Flower Show, and, in 2008, a Gold Medal at R.H.S. Tatton Park. 
His first TV appearance was in 1999 as the expert on 'Surprise Gardeners' for Carlton TV. After this, he moved to the BBC TV and "Real Rakeovers" as the expert contributor. His first show as sole presenter was "Weekend Gardener" for UKTV Style in 2000. Also in 2000, he co-presented "Gardening Neighbours" for BBC 2. This was followed by three series of "Housecall". After this, he joined Gardeners' World Live as a specialist presenter, and then soon moved on to become a presenter on Gardeners' World, alongside Monty Don and Rachel De Thame.

Jelly doughnut

Jelly (or jam) doughnut varieties include the German Berliner, Australia and Britain's jam doughnuts, sufganiyot from Israel, and the jelly-filled doughnuts sold in the United States and Canada. Japanese anpan are similar to the Berliner, except they contain red bean paste. Krafne from Eastern Europe also include a jelly-filled variety. In Italy, bomboloni are popular. Austria also has a jelly doughnut known as krapfen that is typically filled with apricot jam and topped with powdered sugar. The Polish pączki is also similar to a jelly doughnut.
United States.
A 1942 headline in the "Hartford Courant" reported that "Jelly Doughnut Diets Harmful to War Effort." A 1976 "Los Angeles Times" story explains how to make jelly doughnuts from scratch for a "tasty after-school" snack for youngsters.
In a 1997 taste test, Ruth Reichl graded jelly doughnuts from a local doughnut shop higher than ones from national chain doughnut shops.
Israel.
Jelly or custard filled doughnuts are known as sufganiyot in Hebrew and are the number one Hanukkah treat. They are cooked in oil which is in keeping with the theme of the holiday, celebrating one day's worth of oil "keeping a sacred lamp alight for eight."

Iraqi M80 helmet

The Iraqi M80 Helmet is a military helmet made of compressed canvas used by the Iraqi Armed Forces from the early 1980s onwards. They were used in the Iran-Iraq War, The Gulf War/Operation Desert Storm and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq/Operation Iraqi Freedom. These helmets were originally manufactured in South Korea but in 1990 an Iraqi-made version appeared, which is usually fitted with a distinctive rubber rim. Both types of helmet are still in limited service with the Iraqi Security Forces but are being replaced by the American PASGT helmet.
History.
Before the 1980s the Iraqi Armed Forces had used various steel helmets which were mostly of Soviet origin. These included Russian M40 and M60 helmets and Polish M50 patterns. During the early 1980s the M80 helmet began to replace these patterns. These new helmets were of a lightweight composite construction undoubtedly inexpensive to purchase from their South Korean manufacturers, at a time when the Iraqi economy was severely stretched by the war with Iran.
Design.
Clearly drawing inspiration from the American M1 Helmet which had first appeared during World War II, it differed significantly in being constructed from compressed layers of fabric coated in plastic. This inevitably offered troops a much lower degree of ballistic protection than a steel helmet, or modern composite helmet such as the PASGT. The M80's liner is a direct copy of the Riddell liner seen on American M1 helmets made after 1972 and used a US type T1 chinstrap. The helmets were supplied painted dark green, this was often overpainted in a desert tan colour which has a tendency to rub off, revealing the original colour underneath. They also have a tendency to fray at the edges, showing the layers of fabric used in their construction.
In 1990 an Iraqi-made version of this helmet, the M90, appeared which was of inferior quality construction. These later helmets are prone to splitting at the edges and have a protective rubber rim. The post 1990 helmets were supplied in desert tan colour only. Both types of helmet can be found with a variety of Arabic and military unit markings, and are sometimes painted white with red markings for the Iraqi Military Police. Many Iraqi helmets were abandoned in large numbers on the battlefields of Iraq and Kuwait and proved to be popular souvenirs with western soldiers returning home from the Persian Gulf.

Tanais Tablets

The Tanais Tablets are two 3rd century AD tablets written in Greek from the city of Tanais, in the proximity of modern Rostov-on-Don, Russia. At the time, Tanais was composed of a mixed Greek and Sarmatian population. The tablets are public inscriptions which commemorate renovation works in the city. One of the tablets (Tanais Tablet A) is damaged and is not fully reconstructed. The other one (Tanais Tablet B) is fully preserved and is dated to 220 AD (Bosporan year 517). The tablets were discovered by Russian archaeologist Pavel Mikhailovich Leontjev in 1853 and are today kept in the lapidary of the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.
Significance.
The tablets are considered important for Croatian history. Among the names on the tablets are those of three men: Horoúathos, Horoáthos, and Horóathos (Χορούαθ[ος], Χοροάθος, Χορόαθος). Some interpret the names as anthroponyms of Croatian people. Tanais Tablet B also mentions Horoathos as the son of Sandarz which is a Scytho-Sarmatian (Iranian) name. Some view this as an indication that Croats were at that time Iranian people of the Sarmatian/Alan division and became Slavicized in the following centuries. However, there is no evidence of any connection of those personal names with historical or modern Croats, except for the seemingly similar name.

Baekje language

The language of the ancient kingdom of Baekje (18 BCE – 660 CE), one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, is sparsely attested; indeed, it is not clear that what material exists is from the same language.
Since Baekje was established by immigrants from Goguryeo (the Buyeo-Baekje / Puyo-Paekche), is presumed that they spoke the Goguryeo language, and several attested words support this idea; however, even if that is true, it is not known which language the indigenous Samhan people (Han-Baekje) spoke, or if the attested material may be a mix of Goguryeo and Samhan. The Gaya confederacy, however, was founded by one of the Samhan tribes, so it's possible that the old Baekje language was related to Gaya; based on toponymic evidence, it may be then that Buyeo-Baekje was related to Korean, and Han-Baekje, despite the name, to Japanese.

Malaspina Peninsula

The Malaspina Peninsula is a peninsula in the northern Gulf of Georgia-Sunshine Coast region of British Columbia, Canada. It extends northwest from the town of Powell River, which lies near its isthmus, past the settlement of Lund, to Desolation Sound. This sound spans the opening of Toba Inlet, a fjord lying between Lund and the Discovery Islands to the west and northwest. 
The Malaspina Peninsula is mountainous and is the traditional territory of the Sliammon group of the Mainland Comox indigenous people.
Like Malaspina Strait and the Malaspina Glacier further north in Alaska, the peninsula was named for Alessandro Malaspina, an Italian of noble birth in the Spanish navy who was among the many captains in the service of Spain who helped explore and chart the Alaska and British Columbia Coasts.
Malaspina Peninsula and Malaspina Strait were named in 1859 by Captain George Henry Richards of the "Plumper". Richards' choice of name was probably influenced by the nearby Malaspina Inlet, named in 1792 by Galiano and Valdés, who had been officers serving under Malaspina.

Pedro Duro Benito (1811–1886) was an important Spanish businessman of the 19th century, founder of current industrial group Duro Felguera and impeller of the siderurgy in Spain.
Duro was born in Brieva de Cameros, La Rioja, and he died in the Principality of Asturias in 1886. He began in 1857 to construct Felguera Factory, a metallurgical factory that managed to be the most important of Spain in the 19th century, and also during part of the 20th up to the decade of 1960. It was, in addition, the first "big siderurgy" that was constructed in Spain. His descendants were nominated "Marquesses of La Felguera" by the king Alfonso XIII. In addition, Duro obtained Isabel The Catolich's Cross and decoration of Légion d'honneur of the French government. He was buried in La Felguera, where the workers of his factory raised a big monument. He was pioneering in social measures for the workers. His work motivated, in addition, the industrial expansion in the north of Spain. Today the company that he created is called "Duro Felguera" and it quotes in the Spanish stock exchange since 1902.

Mexico–United States soccer rivalry

A sports rivalry that exists between the national soccer teams of Mexico and the United States, widely considered the two major powers of CONCACAF. Matches between the two nations often attract much media attention, public interest and comment in both countries. The first match was played in 1934, and the teams have met 62 times, with Mexico leading the overall series 33–18–13 (W–L–T), outscoring the U.S. 131–73. However, since the 1990s, tides began to change due to a rapid growth of soccer in the United States. During this decade, Mexico continued to hold an edge over their arch-rivals but since the 2000s the series has favored the U.S. 12–5–4 (W–L–T).
Origin.
The first match between the two sides was a qualifying match in Italy for the final ticket to the 1934 World Cup. Where soccer was seen as a foreign sport in the United States, in Mexico, like many Latin American nations, was embraced from the start as part of their culture. The US had established a professional league in 1921, but it had folded in 1933. The final score was United States 4–2 Mexico. Three years later, Mexico began a winning streak over the US in friendlies 7–2, 7–3, and 5–1 in Mexico City.
Recent years.
The rivalry continues to play out most often in annual friendlies, usually scheduled during the early months in U.S. cities with large Mexican American populations such as Los Angeles, Houston, Phoenix, and Chicago. The most important matchups take place in quadrennial World Cup qualification matches and major tournaments such as the CONCACAF Gold Cup and Copa América.
On neutral territory, the series is tied 2–2. In addition, the lone World Cup finals match between the two countries, a knockout, Round of 16 meeting at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Jeonju, South Korea, resulted in a 2–0 victory for the United States. This defeat is considered one of the worst embarrassments ever for football in Mexico and since then the rivalry grew significantly.
Prior to 2012, Mexico had never lost to the United States at home, owning a 23–0–1 (W–L–T) record on their native soil. Mexico has won in the United States seven times, compiling a record of 7–13–9 (W–L–T). The overall Mexican record in the US, however, does not reflect the current competitive nature of the series. Since their 1999 win in the U.S. Cup, Mexico has been 2–9–3 on U.S. soil.
To date, only three players, Martin Vasquez, Edgar Castillo, and Joe Corona, have played for both nations. Castillo, who was born in Las Cruces, New Mexico, debuted with the Mexican side in August 2007 under then manager Hugo Sánchez of which whom was also part of the 2008 CONCACAF Men Pre-Olympic Tournament. Castillo played his first game for the United States, a friendly against Denmark in 2009.
The US defeated Mexico 1–0 at Estadio Azteca on Wednesday, August 15, 2012. It was the first victory for the US on Mexican soil in the 75 year rivalry.
In the 21st century, the rivalry added a new chapter with the nickname "Dos a Cero" (2–0) to US fans. Starting in the 2001 during the qualifying cycle for the 2002 World Cup, the US hosted Mexico in Columbus, Ohio at Crew Stadium. The first meeting between Mexico and the United States ended in a 2–0 win for the US. Following the victory, the US hosted Mexico in Crew Stadium again in 2005, 2009, and 2013 for World Cup Qualifiers (2006, 2010, and 2014 qualifying cycles). Each time these teams met in Columbus, the US has come out with a 2–0 win. Following the September 10, 2013 game the US clinched a World Cup berth following a Panama Honduras 2–2 draw. Their meeting in the round of 16 of the 2002 World Cup also ended in a U.S. win by the same score.
Incidents.
Prior to an Olympic qualifying game in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, on February 10, 2004, US player Landon Donovan reportedly urinated on the pitch during practice, according to Mexican media, which angered Mexican fans and media outlets. Subsequent video showed Donovan actually urinated near some bushes outside the practice areas. Two days later, on February 12, 2004, Mexico defeated the US 4-0, and the crowd was heard chanting "Osama, Osama, Osama", in reference to Osama bin Laden and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
In a friendly held in Glendale, Arizona on February 7, 2007, Landon Donovan scored in injury time to give the US a 2-0 lead and win over Mexico. After the goal, Mexico goalkeeper Osvaldo Sanchez tried to trip US player Eddie Johnson as Johnson was running to celebrate the goal with Donovan. No contact was made, and no reprimand resulted.
On February 11, 2009, the first qualifier for the 2010 World Cup was held in Columbus Crew Stadium, and resulted in a 2-0 victory for the US against Mexico. After the game, Frankie Hejduk was involved in an altercation with Mexican assistant coach Francisco "Paco" Javier Ramírez, who slapped Hejduk in the tunnels as both teams headed to the locker room. Hejduk did not retaliate, and Ramirez was not reprimanded, and never apologized.
Women's soccer.
The rivalry is less hostile in women's football but still important. Most games have been played on US soil. However, games have been played between both teams in Mexico as well; including one at Estadio Azteca in 1999 which ended 0–0. Another was played during the 2008 CONCACAF Women's U-20 Championship at Puebla, Mexico, where the US U–20 defeated the Mexico U-20 3–0. The Mexican women's team has only defeated the US twice; once at the 2007 Pan American Games in Brazil, where Mexico won 3–2 after being down 2 goals. The other time was the 2010 CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup semifinal, where they won 2–1. This win got the Mexican women to their second Women's World Cup. While the match at the Pan American Games is not considered official by both associations and FIFA, the match at the Gold Cup is official.
Popular culture.
A 2012 documentary, "Gringos at the Gate / Ahi Vienen Los Gringos", written and directed by Pablo Miralles, Roberto Donati, and Michael Whalen,
focuses on the cultural differences between the United States and Mexico when it comes to football. This includes the conflict of Mexican-American players in the US while their family might support Mexico.

Conviction politics

Conviction politics refers to the practice of campaigning based on a politician's own fundamental values or ideas, rather than attempting to represent an existing consensus or simply take positions that are popular in polls.
On the right, the term has been adopted by politicians like Margaret Thatcher, who declared "I am not a consensus politician. I am a conviction politician" upon assuming leadership of the Conservative Party in 1975. On the left, it was vocally supported by Paul Wellstone, whose Wellstone Action now trains future politicians in his theory of conviction politics.
Theory.
There are a number of arguments in favor of conviction politics. One is that it is more honest -- a conviction politician simply says what they believe rather than shading their opinions to be more palatable to their audience. Another is that by voicing strong opinions they push public debate forward and promote a genuine discussion of political issues. Even if a candidate loses, they will have promoted their particular political ideas and hopefully persuaded some voters of their value.
There are also more instrumental reasons. By arguing forcefully for their positions during the campaign, a politician is more able to pursue those goals once in office. Also, proponents argue that conviction politicians are more likely to win. When he was a candidate, Tom Perriello said that "More often, the deepest connection with another person comes from when I disagree with them and admit it, because at least they know I will tell the truth. While some strategists focus on positioning candidates on issue after issue, I believe most voters focus more on whether the candidate integrity and character on the whole, demonstrated by the conviction to take a stand."
Paul Wellstone frequently heard voters tell him "I don't always agree with you, but I like it that I know where you stand." He found that when he announced his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, an unpopular position at the time, he jumped to a five-point lead in the polls.
In the United States, 87% of voters say they think politicians are "pretty much willing to say whatever it takes in order to get themselves elected." By saying what they believe and ignoring the polls, conviction politicians distinguish themselves from other politicians in this way.
History.
Thatcher, like her contemporary Ronald Reagan in the United States, argued that her leadership should be a time for big, bold changes, grounded in the central principles of her ideology. "It was not a set of policies cobbled together from minute to minute, begged, borrowed or stolen from other people," she said when describing her government. "It was successful because it was based on clear, firmly-held principles..." A devout Methodist, she further defended these principles as being grounded in the Christian Bible: "I believe that by taking together these key elements from the Old and New Testaments, we gain a view of the universe, a proper attitude to work and principles to shape economic and social life. We are told we must work and use our talents to create wealth."
Her thinking on the subject was influenced by Keith Joseph, sometimes considered the "intellectual leader" of modern British conservatism and the man Thatcher called "my closest political friend." Joseph had developed an intellectual critique of the reigning postwar and Keynesian consensus and criticized the "consensus politics" that continued to promote it.
In 2007, then-current British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown announced he too was "a conviction politician" after private talks with Lady Thatcher in a 10 Downing Street visit. He was criticised for the gaffe as being inappropriate for a Labour Party politician to identify with the 81-year-old former Conservative prime minister.
In the US, Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone was a major proponent of conviction politics from the left, promoting peace, environmental and labor protections, and health care. After Wellstone's death in 2002, his longtime aide and campaign manager, Jeff Blodgett, founded Wellstone Action, which promotes conviction politics through education and training. Blodgett's book, "Winning Your Election the Wellstone Way", strongly promotes conviction politics for progressive politicians.
Virginia congressman Tom Perriello explicitly ran his successful campaign based on "conviction politics" and hoped his example would encourage others to run conviction politics campaigns in the future.
Criticisms.
The conviction politics practiced by George W. Bush has been called a "hard ideology" with "religious and chauvinistic underpinnings" and "contributed to the call by Muslim fundamentalists to a broader jihad" – it has "redefined the war on terror and alienated Arab and Muslim public opinion."
Critics of Margaret Thatcher's conviction politics say it "burst apart the old consensus" and has "fostered dissensus".
Some critics have gone farther and have said that conviction politics, especially in the US, are "theological politics".

Flag of the Mughal Empire

The Mughal Empire had a number of imperial flags and standards. The principal imperial standard of the Mughals was known as the "alam". It was primarily moss green. Some other "alam" was also scarlet. It displayed a lion and sun facing the hoist of the flag. The Mughals traced their use of the "alam" back to Timur.
The imperial standard was displayed to the right of the throne and also at the entrance of the Emperor's encampment and in front of the emperor during military marches.
According to the "Ain-i-Akbari", during Akbar's reign, whenever the emperor rode out, not less than five "alams" were carried along with the "qur" (a collection of flags and other insignia) wrapped up in scarlet cloth bags. They were unfurled on the days of festivity, and in battle. Edward Terry, chaplain to Sir Thomas Roe, who came during the reign of Jahangir, described in his "Voyage to East-India" (1655) that the royal standard, made of silk, with a couching lion shadowing part of the body of the sun inscribed on it, was carried on an elephant whenever the emperor travelled.
A painting by Payag in a manuscript of the "Padshahnama", a chronicle on Shah Jahan's reign, preserved in the Royal Library, Windsor Castle depicted the Mughal standards as the scarlet pennons with green borders with a passant lion and rising sun behind it. Another painting in the same manuscript depicted the Mughal standards having green fields with a couchant lion and rising sun behind it.

Bowie Railroad Buildings

The Bowie Railroad Buildings comprise three small frame structures which served as the depot complex for the Pennsylvania Railroad at the junction of the Washington (Amtrak/MARC Train) and the Pope's Creek branches. The complex is located at Bowie in Prince George's County, Maryland. The complex includes a single-story freight depot, a two-story interlocking tower, and an open passenger shed located alongside the tracks of the Huntington, or Old Bowie section of the city.
The complex of buildings are significant for their contribution to the development of rail transportation in the region, and as examples of the types of buildings commonly associated with small-scale rail junctions in the early 20th century. The railroad depot structures in Old Bowie are rare survivors recalling the once prominent number of railway stations in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. These small buildings are testament to the significance that a railroad junction had in the commerce and intercourse of the nation at the time of the heyday of the railroads. As an active station, the original Bowie Station was built by the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, which was then acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and later by Penn Central Railroad. When Amtrak took over passenger service in 1971, the station became a stop for the Chesapeake train between Washington and Philadelphia, until it was acquired by MARC, and replaced by the Penn Line. The buildings have been restored to the Pennsylvania Railroad livery of gray with burgundy trim, and are being maintained by the City of Bowie Museum Division, and supported by the Huntington Heritage Society as a community museum.
In 1989, MARC service moved to Bowie State.
Huntington Railroad Museum.
The Huntington Railroad Museum is a railroad museum located in Bowie, Maryland. The museum is owned by the municipal government and is located in the Bowie railroad station. It hosts several displays featuring Bowie's railroad history, including artifacts and photographs.
A 1922 Norfolk and Western Railroad caboose is located on the museum grounds. There is no admission charge to the museum which is handicapped accessible.
The City of Bowie purchased the buildings that comprise the museum from the railroad and located them together on the current museum site in 1992. These buildings were then restored in collaboration with the Huntington Heritage Society.
The buildings are located at 8614 Chestnut Avenue, near the intersections of 11th Street, close to the rail line. The City of Bowie maintains six sites in its museum system, all of which have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1998.

Malaspina Strait is a strait in the northern Gulf of Georgia-Sunshine Coast region of British Columbia, Canada. It separates Texada Island from the upper Sunshine Coast-Malaspina Peninsula area on the adjacent mainland.
The strait and the peninsula were named in 1859 by Captain George Henry Richards of the "Plumper" in honor of Alessandro Malaspina, an Italian noble who commanded one of the exploration ships during the Spanish exploration of the British Columbia Coast. Richards' choice of name was probably influenced by the nearby Malaspina Inlet, named in 1792 by Galiano and Valdés, who had been officers serving under Malaspina.

George Scott Railton

George Scott Railton (6 July 1849 – 19 July 1913) was the first Commissioner of The Salvation Army and second in command to its Founder General William Booth.
Early life.
Born at Arbroath in Scotland, the son of Methodist missionaries Lancelot Railton and his wife, Margaret Scott, Railton was educated at Woodhouse Grove School in Leeds, then only open to sons of Methodist ministers. His father and mother both died on 8 November 1864 at Peel, Isle of Man, probably of cholera.
The death of his parents left the 15 year-old Railton homeless and jobless. His older brother, the Rev. Launcelot Railton, a Methodist minister, found him work in London with a shipping company, but not finding it to his liking Railton decided to go to Morocco in 1869 as a Christian missionary. However, this being unsuccessful and finding himself stranded in Morocco, he had to work his passage back to Great Britain as a steward. In 1870 he began to work in Stockton-on-Tees for an uncle who owned a shipping business, but preached the Gospel at every available opportunity. In the same year William Booth went to Matlock to recuperate and where he met the Rev. Launcelot Railton, who told Booth of his younger brother George's attempt to convert the Moroccans, adding that George was just the sort of person that Booth's Christian Mission was looking for.
Two years later, in 1872, Booth received a letter from George Scott Railton, who had read a copy of The Christian Mission's second report, 'How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel', and had been so moved by it that he offered himself to the cause.
The Salvation Army.
In October 1872 Railton travelled to London to commence his work for The Christian Mission, (renamed The Salvation Army in 1878 at a meeting at which Railton was present), and for some years he lived in the Booth household as William Booth's secretary. He became the acting editor of 'The Christian Mission Magazine' and in September 1873 was appointed General Secretary to The Christian Mission.
By 1880, Booth's son Bramwell Booth had matured and became his father's secretary. Railton, who since his youth had had a wish to be a missionary, persuaded Booth to send him to New York to begin the Army's work there. He was well suited to such work, being a skilled linguist, dedicated, and hard-working, and both he and his superiors felt more comfortable with him on the frontier than at headquarters. For example, at the celebration to mark the launch of the Salvation Army Assurance Society he sat on the platform barefoot and in sackcloth to register his disapproval of this worldly turn. With male officers being few in number, Railton took Captain Emma Westbrook and six other young women with the intention of training them for the work on the voyage to the United States. 
On 10 March 1880 Railton arrived at Castle Garden, New York with his seven 'Hallelujah Lassies' and immediately set about preaching to the New Yorkers and joining with the unofficial work already begun by the Shirley family in Philadelphia. He also began the work in Newark, New Jersey, leaving two young women in charge there, while he himself set off for St. Louis, Missouri to begin preaching there, but here he was unsuccessful. Meanwhile, in New York the work had gone so well that by May there were sixteen officers, forty cadets, and four hundred and twelve soldiers. By the end of 1880 one thousand five hundred had been converted. In January 1881 Railton received orders from William Booth to return to England. Railton protested that he was needed in the United States but Booth insisted that he should return home.
In 1884 Railton was married to Marianne Deborah Lydia Ellen Parkyn, a Salvation Army Sergeant in Torquay in Devon. Her father was a Free Church minister who disapproved of The Salvation Army and who opposed the wedding. Eventually he gave his consent and the couple were married by William Booth at Exeter Hall on 17 January 1884. The couple settled at Margate and had children, but Railton was there only rarely.
On 1 January 1885, Commissioner and Mrs. Railton set sail for Natal in South Africa, arriving there on 8 March, with Railton's health declining. On 6 May they arrived at Pietermaritzburg where the idea of the Salvation Army's 'Red Shield Work' for men in the forces came into being. On 19 August 1885 the couple set sail for England. 
In 1886 General Booth sent Railton to Germany, where his preaching met with considerable hostility, and little progress was made. However, by 1890, because Germany had a new Kaiser (Wilhelm II) and Otto von Bismarck was retired, it was believed that the situation would improve, and Commissioner Railton was officially appointed Territorial Commander. Later that year, he returned to England to conduct the funeral service of Catherine Booth, 'The Army Mother'. In 1893, as part of a tightening of restrictions by the German government, Railton was expelled from the country.
Later years.
In 1894 Railton was sent to Spain, where he remained until being recalled to England in the summer of 1895. Although by now his health was declining, he was called on to assist Bramwell Booth for whom he travelled the world inspecting the work of The Salvation Army. In 1899 Railton set sail for South Africa to negotiate with the political and military leaders before the launching of the Red Shield work amongst the troops. Although this was initially difficult eventually he overcame all the problems and returned to England at the end of the Boer War in December 1900, where he remained until being sent to take charge of the work in France towards the end of 1901.
At the end of 1902 Railton returned to work at Salvation Army Headquarters until 1903, when he left for West Africa to launch the work of The Salvation Army there. On his return in December 1903 his health had deteriorated greatly, and he was not seen in public again until the International Congress in June 1904.
Death.
In his later years Railton continued to travel widely, visiting many countries on behalf of The Salvation Army, including China, Japan and Russia. 
While travelling to Le Locle in Switzerland he had to change trains at Cologne. Having a long wait for his connection he visited the quarters of the local Salvation Army officers. Delayed by their hospitality and their prayers, he had little time to catch his train and ran up the stairs to the platform carrying his heavy bags. On gaining his seat he collapsed and died of a heart attack. He was 64 years old. 
George Scott Railton died on 19 July 1913, and was buried in Abney Park Cemetery beside the graves of Catherine and William Booth.
Railton's son was the Reverend David Railton (1884–1955), a Church of England clergyman who conceived the idea of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in 1916 while serving as a British Army Chaplain on the Western Front.
Legacy.
The Railton School for Youth Worker Training in Suffern, New York is named after Commissioner Railton.

John Wainwright (author)

John William Wainwright (25 February 1921 - September 1995), was a British crime novelist and author of 83 books, four of which have been published under the pen name Jack Ripley. He also wrote some short stories (mostly uncollected in book format), 7 radio plays, and an indefinite amount of magazine articles and newspaper columns.
Biography.
Wainwright was born in Hunslet, an area of inner-city south Leeds, in 1921. He left school at fifteen and served as a rear gunner in Lancaster bombers during the Second World War. In 1947 he joined the West Riding Constabulary as a Police Constable. While serving as a policeman, he went back to studying in his spare time – earning himself a law degree in 1956 – and in 1965 he tried writing a crime novel, which was accepted by George Hardinge, the editor of Collins Crime Club, and published as "Death in a Sleeping City". In 1966 Wainwright left the force and became a full-time novelist. In 1968 Hardinge became senior editor at Macmillan Publishers, taking Wainwright's contract with him.
Wainwright died in 1995, a few months after the publication of his last novel, "The Life and Times of Christmas Calvert... Assassin".
Works and style.
An extremely prolific author - from 1966 to 1984 he kept an average of three books a year - Wainwright published 78 crime novels, a short-story collection and four non-fiction works, including two autobiographical volumes, "Tail-End Charlie" and "Wainwright's Beat"; a career guide, "Shall I Be a Policeman?" (1967), and a home security handbook, "Guard Your Castle" (1973; new edition, 1983).
One of his most popular novels is "Brainwash" (1977), upon which the movies Garde à vue and Under Suspicion (2000 film) are based. "Cul-de-sac" (1984) was also very well received in its days, mainly thanks to a warm endorsement by fellow writer Georges Simenon, who defined it "an unforgettable novel".
Most of his novels fall into the police procedural category, but Wainwright also tried his hand at the suspense thriller ("Square Dance", 1975; "Portrait in Shadows", 1986), the serial killer novel ("A Ripple of Murders", 1978), the spy novel ("The Crystallized Carbon Pig", 1966; "Cause for a Killing", 1974), and the legal thriller ("The Jury People", 1978; "Man of Law", 1980), with a couple of forays into the classical whodunit and the locked room mystery ("High-Class Kill", 1973). His novel "All on a Summer's Day" (1981), which chronicles twenty-four hours in the life of a Police station in the north of England, is quite similar in conception to Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novel "Hail, Hail the Gang's All Here" (1971). Wainwright was also a passionate traditional jazz and swing music fan, and some of his novels have a strong jazz background, particularly the black comedy "Do Nothin' till You Hear from Me" (1977).
In an interview given to the Italian periodical "Il Giallo Mondadori" in 1975, Wainwright cited Raymond Chandler, Ed McBain and Ian Fleming as his favourite authors.
Critical assessment.
Wainwright always led a very private life, almost never giving interviews and rarely appearing in public, while enjoying a steady if not spectacular success in his lifetime. As a consequence of this, his name is all but forgotten nowadays (his death went completely unrecorded by newspapers and reference books until 2003), and a critical assessment of his huge output is still yet to come, considering also that all his books are currently out of print.

GIS and aquatic science

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has become an integral part of aquatic science and limnology. Water by its very nature is dynamic. Features associated with water are thus ever-changing. To be able to keep up with these changes, technological advancements have given scientists methods to enhance all aspects of scientific investigation, from satellite tracking of wildlife to computer mapping of habitats. Agencies like the US Geological Survey, US Fish and Wildlife Service as well as other federal and state agencies are utilizing GIS to aid in their conservation efforts.
GIS is being used in multiple fields of aquatic science from limnology, hydrology, aquatic botany, stream ecology, oceanography and marine biology. Applications include using satellite imagery to identify, monitor and mitigate habitat loss. Imagery can also show the condition of inaccessible areas. Scientists can track movements and develop a strategy to locate locations of concern. GIS can be used to track invasive species, endangered species, and population changes.
One of the advantages of the system is the availability for the information to be shared and updated at any time through the use of web-based data collection.
GIS and fish.
In the past, GIS was not a practical source of analysis due to the difficulty in obtaining spatial data on habitats or organisms in underwater environments. With the advancement of radio telemetry, hydroacoustic telemetry and side-scan sonar biologists have been able to track fish species and create databases that can be incorporated into a GIS program to create a geographical representation. Using radio and hydroacoustic telemetry, biologists are able to locate fish and acquire relatable data for those sites, this data may include substrate samples, temperature, and conductivity. Side-scan sonar allows biologists to map out a river bottom to gain a representation of possible habitats that are used. These two sets of data can be overlaid to delineate the distribution of fish and their habitats for fish. This method has been used in the study of the pallid sturgeon.
Over a period of time large amounts of data are collected and can be used to track patterns of migration, spawning locations and preferred habitat. Before, this data would be mapped and overlaid manually. Now this data can be entered into a GIS program and be layered, organized and analyzed in a way that was not possible to do in the past. Layering within a GIS program allows for the scientist to look at multiple species at once to find possible watersheds that are shared by these species, or to specifically choose one species for further examination.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) in, cooperation with other agencies, were able to use GIS in helping map out habitat areas and movement patterns of pallid sturgeon. At the Columbia Environmental Research Center their effort relies on a customized ArcPad and ArcGIS, both ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute) applications, to record sturgeon movements to streamline data collection. A relational database was developed to manage tabular data for each individual sturgeon, including initial capture and reproductive physiology. Movement maps can be created for individual sturgeon. These maps help track the movements of each sturgeon through space and time. This allowed these researchers to prioritize and schedule field personnel efforts to track, map, and recapture sturgeon.
GIS and macrophytes.
Macrophytes are an important part of healthy ecosystems. They provide habitat, refuge, and food for fish, wildlife, and other organisms. Though natural occurring species are of great interest so are the invasive species that occur alongside these in our environment. GIS is being used by agencies and their respective resource managers as a tool to model these important macrophyte species. Through the use of GIS resource managers can assess the distributions of this important aspect of aquatic environments through a spatial and temporal scale. The ability to track vegetation change through time and space to make predictions about vegetation change are some of the many possibilities of GIS. Accurate maps of the aquatic plant distribution within an aquatic ecosystem are an essential part resource management. 
It is possible to predict the possible occurrences of aquatic vegetation. For example, the USGS has created a model for the American wild celery (Vallisneria americana) by developing a statistical model that calculates the probability of submersed aquatic vegetation. They established a web link to an Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) ArcGIS Server website *Submersed Aquatic Vegetation Model to make their model predictions available online. These predictions for distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation can potentially have an effect on foraging birds by creating avoidance zones by humans. If it is known where these areas are, birds can be left alone to feed undisturbed. When there are years where the aquatic vegetation is predicted to be limited in these important wildlife habitats, managers can be alerted.
Invasive species have become a great conservation concern for resource managers. GIS allows managers to map out plant locations and abundances. These maps can then be used to determine the threat of these invasive plants and help the managers decide on management strategies. Surveys of these species can be conducted and then downloaded into a GIS system. Coupled with this, native species can be included to determine how these communities respond with each other. By using known data of preexisting invasive species GIS models could predict future outbreaks by comparing biological factors. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Invasive Aquatic Species Program (CAES IAPP) is using GIS to evaluate risk factors. GIS allows managers to georeference plant locations and abundance. This allows for managers to display invasive communities alongside native species for study and management.
