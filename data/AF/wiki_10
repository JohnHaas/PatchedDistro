The Magic Pan

The Magic Pan was an American chain of full-service restaurants specializing in crêpes, popular in the late 1970s through early 1990s.
History.
The Magic Pan restaurant company was started at Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco, California, by Hungarian immigrants Lazlo and Paulette Fono.
Lazlo Fono is generally recognized as the man who invented the crepe-making machine used in the chain's restaurants, starting in the mid-1960s. 
The Quaker Oats Company acquired Magic Pan from the Fonos in 1970, and it became the company's primary restaurant chain. Quaker Oats sold the company to an Oakland, California-based company, Bay Bottlers, in 1982, at which time there were 110 Magic Pan locations throughout the United States and Canada. The last remaining Magic Pan restaurant in McLean, Virginia, was phased out of business. 
The concept was re-introduced by Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises as a fast-food crepe stand in Northbrook, Illinois, in 2005. This resurrected version of Magic Pan does not have the crepe-making machine; it instead uses recreations of the original recipes. The revived chain opened a second location in the food court of the Mall of America near Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Menu.
Among the menu items were crêpes filled with spinach and mushroom souffle, chicken divan, crepe suzette, strawberries and sour cream, chantilly, coffee chocolate sauce ice cream, and "cherry royale".
Production.
The restaurant designed an automated system to make crepes at a crepe station, consisting of a motorized conveyor that would heat metal pans. An attendant would dip the bottom of the pans in the crepe batter, to ensure an even coating.

Sir John in Love

Sir John in Love is an opera in four acts by the English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. The libretto, by the composer himself, is based on Shakespeare's "The Merry Wives of Windsor" and supplemented with texts by Philip Sidney, Thomas Middleton, and Beaumont and Fletcher. The music deploys English folk tunes, including "Greensleeves". Originally titled "The Fat Knight", the opera premiered at the Parry Opera Theatre, Royal College of Music, London on 21 March 1929. Its first professional performance was on 9 April 1946 at Sadler's Wells Theatre.
Performance history.
Performances of the opera have remained rare, including 1978 and 1988 productions by the Bronx Opera (New York City) and a 1997 Barbican concert performance. After 1958, the opera remained unstaged in the UK until the 2006 production at English National Opera (ENO), which was ENO's first production of the work. In August 2010, the Australian Shakespeare Festival, an initiative of the University of Tasmania, gave a professional concert presentation of the opera conducted by Myer Fredman.
Synopsis.
Act 1.
Outside Page's house, Justice Shallow and Parson Evans are angry at Sir John Falstaff and his men for getting Abraham Slender drunk and stealing his wallet. Slender is trying to compose a sonnet to express his affection for Anne Page, but cannot get past the line "O sweet Anne Page". Falstaff enters, dismissive of the anger of Shallow and Evans towards him. Anne Page, Mistress Page and Mistress Ford then arrive.
Remaining outside, Evans and Shallow conspire to arrange a match between Slender and Anne Page, and send Simple, Slender's servant, to Mistress Quickly to obtain her assistance. Anne Page then directs the men towards dinner. Left alone, she ponders her mother's wish for her to marry, Dr Caius, which she does not desire. However, her true love, Master Fenton, then arrives. Anne Page and Fenton sing a duet, but Master Page drives off Fenton, as he thinks that Fenton is only after Anne Page's dowry. Master Page is himself inclined more towards Slender as a match for Anne.
As Fenton hides, Dr Caius, his servant John Rugby, and Mistress Quickly appear. Caius hopes for Mistress Quickly's assistance in winning over Anne Page. Simple tries to deliver the letter from Slender, but Caius intercepts it, and after reading it, thinks that Evans also has designs on Anne Page. After Caius, Rugby and Simple depart, Fenton appears and gives Mistress Quickly a ring for Anne and some gold for herself, to assist him in winning Anne Page. The gold directs Mistress Quickly to place Fenton at the top of the list of suitors for Anne Page.
In the inn, Falstaff notes that he is facing hard financial times. He comes up with a scheme to seduce Mistresses Ford and Page and swindle them of some money. Falstaff writes identical love letters to Mistresses Ford and Page, but his henchmen Nym and Pistol refuse to be part of this scheme. Falstaff then instructs his page Robin to deliver the separate letters.
Nym and Pistol then decide to inform Master Ford of Falstaff's scheme. Ford enters, already feeling jealousy and suspicion of his wife's fidelity. When Nym and Pistol tell Ford of Falstaff's plan, Ford resolves to visit Falstaff in disguise to see how far Falstaff's plot proceeds. The merry wives, Mistresses Ford and Page, sing of cuckoos in counterpoint to Ford's rage.
Act 2.
"Scene 1: A room in Page's house"
In Page's house, Mistress Page reads the letter to her from Falstaff. Mistress Ford then arrives with her own letter from Falstaff. The merry wives compare the letters and see that they are identical except for the names. They vow revenge on Falstaff for his attempted treachery. They engage Mistress Quickly to deliver a message to Falstaff that he should go to Alice Ford's house between ten and eleven that night.
"Scene 2: The parlour of the Garter Inn"
Bardolph announces to Falstaff the arrival of a visitor, Master "Brook", who is Ford in disguise. "Brook" affects to be in love with Mistress Ford, but that she has a reputation for fidelity. He offers Falstaff money to see if Falstaff can seduce Mistress Ford on his behalf. "Brook" is shocked to learn that Falstaff already has a planned assignation with Mistress Ford that night. After Falstaff leaves, Ford tears off his disguise and rages against his wife's apparent infidelity.
Act 3.
"Scene 1: A footpath near Windsor"
Fenton asks for the Inn Host's assistance to win Anne Page. Anne arrives, initially expressing some doubts because of Fenton's past association with Falstaff, but he convinces her of his true love. She then tells him of her mother's plan to marry her off to Caius, and her father's plan to marry her off to Slender. Her intention, however, is to marry Fenton, and the Inn Host plans to find a priest to officiate a ceremony between them.
"Scene 2: A field near Windsor"
Caius enters, with plans to challenge Evans to a duel over Anne Page. Caius, along with Ford, Shallow, Slender and the Inn Host, meet Evans by the river bank for the duel. However, the duel between Caius and Evans gradually peters out, until the Host asks them for mutual forgiveness to each other and reconciliation at the Inn over a pint. Ford then invites the company to his house, intending to show them a "monster".
"Scene 3: A room in Ford's house"
At Ford's house, the merry wives, with Mistress Quickly present, are setting the trap for Falstaff, in the form of a laundry hamper. Mistress Ford instructs her servants to dump the contents of the hamper into a ditch on her command. All except Mistress Ford hide, who sings "Greensleeves" in preparation for Falstaff's arrival. Falstaff appears, but before he can start in earnest on the seduction, Mistress Quickly bursts in to warn of Mistress Page rushing over to the house. Mistress Page suddenly comes in to let everyone know that Master Ford is en route to the house in a jealous rage, which to her is part of the scheme to dupe Falstaff, except that Ford truly is on his way to the house, of which no one is aware. The only place for Falstaff to hide is the laundry basket. Falstaff therein hides, and then Ford and his followers suddenly show up, in search of the "monster" alluded to earlier. Mistress Ford directs her servants to remove the laundry basket, which they do, under great strain because of Falstaff's weight. Ford only succeeds in finding Mistress Page hidden behind a curtain.
Act 4.
"Scene 1: A room in Ford's house"
Ford asks forgiveness from his wife, which she grants. The Fords and Pages then plot a final revenge on Falstaff, by luring him to Windsor Forest, where legend has it that Herne the Hunter haunts Herne's Oak, and fairies torment unaware travellers. Mistress Page intends to dress as the fairy queen, and with the help of local children, will taunt Falstaff. Mistress Page tells Caius that Anne will be wearing green, to allow him to find her. In turn, Master Page informs Slender that Anne will be wearing white.
"Scene 2: Windsor Forest"
Falstaff has received a communication from Mistress Ford to meet her at Herne's Oak, dressed as Herne the Hunter, and wearing antlers, in the hope of frightening away any intruders. The merry wives arrive, but before anything between the three of them can happen, some fairies appear and the merry wives quickly depart. Anne Page, dressed in blue, appears with a group of fairies and leads a dance around Herne's Oak. Caius and Slender each arrive, and search respectively for a fairy dressed in green and in white, which they each find and then depart. Fenton arrives and finds Anne Page, and they leave. The fairies tease Falstaff, until a horn call stops the action.
The Fords and Pages come on the scene, and Falstaff realises that he has been tricked. He takes it in good humour. Master Page now says that by this point, Anne is married to Slender. Slender arrives with his new "bride", who turns out to be young William Page in disguise. In turn, Mistress Page says that Anne is now married to Caius. Caius appears, with his "bride", who is actually Falstaff's page, Robin. Fenton and Anne finally appear, and reveal to all that they are officially married. The opera ends with a chorus of reconciliation.

Mediterranean rainbow wrasse

The Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, "Coris julis", is a small, colourful fish in the family Labridae. It can be found in the Mediterranean Sea and in the northeast Atlantic Ocean from Sweden to Senegal (though it is absent from the British Isles). Records of this species south from Senegal and the Cape Verde Islands are actually the closely related "Coris atlantica".
It feeds on amphipods, isopods, sea urchins, polychaete, shrimps, and small gastropods.
Description.
Like many wrasses, "C. julis" is a sequential hermaphrodite: All start in the smaller initial phase. These initial-phase individuals (both females and males) can turn into the larger secondary-phase males. At a length of about , all individuals are secondary-phase males. The maximum length for the species is . There is a marked difference in the appearance of the two phases. In the Mediterranean Sea, the secondary-phase male is green, blue, or brown, with white belly, a dark blue spot over the ventral fin, and a bright orange band on the side, while the smaller primary-phase females and males are brown with yellowish sides and white bellies. Populations in the Atlantic differ in colour and genetics from the Mediterranean population, but are maintained in a single species at present. If found to be separate, the scientific name "Coris festiva" (at present considered a synonym of "C. julis") is available for the Atlantic population.
Habitat.
It is typically found near the shore in places with seagrass or rocks. It is usually found at depths of , but occurs as deep as .
Synonyms.
The following specific names are considered junior synonyms of "C. julis":

Bjorøy Tunnel

The Bjorøy Tunnel () is a long subsea road tunnel connecting Bjorøy in Fjell to the mainland at Hilleren in Bergen, Norway. A part of Hordaland County Road 207, it crosses underneath Vatlestraumen, reaching below mean sea level. It serves as a fixed link for 900 people on Bjorøy and Tyssøy, in addition to a large number of cottage owners. The first proposal was launched in 1980, and construction started on 29 September 1993. There were severe problems because the tunneling encountered an area of sandstone, causing a year's delay. Construction cost 59 million Norwegian krone; it opened on 7 May 1996, and remained a toll road until 29 January 2005.
Specifications.
The Bjorøy Tunnel is a subsea tunnel which runs below Vatlestraumen between Bjorøy and the mainland of Bergen. It carries two lanes of Hordaland County Road 207. It is the only fixed link for the islands of Bjorøy and Tyssøy. The tunnel is long and reaches below mean sea level. The maximum gradient is 10 degrees. It is one of few tunnels in Norway without mobile telephone coverage, although there are emergency telephones that connect to the operation center of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, and the tunnel will receive coverage with the future Norwegian Public Safety Radio.
Before the construction of the Bjorøy Tunnel, the geology of the area was thought to consist entirely of metamorphic basement rocks similar to those exposed on the surrounding islands. The Jurassic sediments encountered in the tunnel included breccia and conglomerate in contact with the underlying gneisses and a sandstone with coal fragments, some of which was quite unconsolidated. Spore and pollen samples gave an Oxfordian age (Late Jurassic) for the sequence. The sedimentary rocks appear to have been deposited into an eroded depression caused by a fault zone, which later reactivated, disrupting the bedding and causing steep dips.
History.
Planning.
Bjorøy had since 1966 been served by the Alvøen–Bjorøyhamn Ferry. The plans for a tunnel to Bjorøy were first launched by the engineer Jack Jahnsen in 1980. These were based on the then under construction Vardø Tunnel, which became the first subsea tunnel in Norway when it opened in 1982. He had a meeting at his place on 18 December 1980, to which the three municipal councilors from Bjorøy also were invited, where he tried to get support for the tunnel, which would be the topic of a municipal council meeting on 20 December. The council unanimously voted in favour of establishing a committee to look into the tunnel. The committee was established on 6 January 1981 and concluded with that there were three alternative possibilities to build a fixed link to Bjorøy: a bridge from the island over Søre Steinsundet via Vestre Steinsundholmen, Kjerringholmen and Kaggen to Søre Snekkevik on Litlesotra; a tunnel under Vatlestraumen to Håkonshella; or a bridge over Vatlestraumen to Håkonshella or Kongshaug.
At the time, a bridge to Litlesotra was estimated to cost NOK 111 million, a tunnel was estimated to cost NOK 36 million, while a bridge over Vatlestraumen was estimated to cost NOK 74 million. All three included a road connection to Tyssøy, with the bridge proposals costing NOK 16 million for the Tyssøy connection, and the tunnel having a cost of NOK 4 million, in part because the earthworks volume from the tunnel could be used to build a mole with a short bridge. Seismology tests were done in August 1983, and they concluded that the ground had good conditions: the uncompacted material laid mostly only deep, albeit at times as deep as . The proposed tunnel crossing followed a mountain ridge, and the maximum depth was between , although the topography went steep down to those depths.
The plans were presented to Johan J. Jakobsen, Minister of Transport and Communications, and cooperation was started with the Norwegian Public Roads Administration to find a suitable connection to Tyssøy, so that they could also take advantage of the tunnel. To connect the two islands, it was chosen to build across Nautasundet, which was shallow and wide. In 1987, Kaare Hartman joined the committee and proposed that the tunnel be built with borrowed money, guaranteed by land-owners on the islands, and repaid using tolls. At the time the project was not on any prioritized investment list, and this way the project was not dependent on public grants. On 7 September 1987, Hartmann reached agreement with Norges Skibshypotek to borrow the estimated NOK 50 million. The bank had a guarantee in the income from the tunnel.
However, Norges Skibshypotek had to withdraw, as it was not permitted to invest in non-shipping investments. Instead, a loan was taken in Bergens Skillingsbank. Four land-owners made a guarantee for NOK 9 million, with a judicial registration covering an area of . They hoped that the value of their land would increase after the tunnel had been built. The same amount was also guaranteed by Fjell Municipality. Public grants were also secured, so the debt would be NOK 27 to 30 million. The planning was done by Chr. F. Grøner, for which the municipality paid the costs. Statistics from the ferry showed that 26,400 cars and 93,902 people had taken it in 1986, which had grown to 40,400 and 121,000 in 1989. The estimates were for a 90% increase until 2000, given an opening in 2002. A bid for the project was gathered from Selmer–Furuholmen, which gave a maximum price of NOK 55 million, given that construction started in 1989.
On 12 December 1989, the committee sent an official offer to Hordaland Public Roads Administration whereby they, as a company under establishment, offered to fully finance the tunnel. The plans called for tolls of NOK 51 for a car and an investment cost of NOK 47 million. The plans were at first nearly discarded by the administration, as they felt it was impossible for a community of 400 people to finance such a large project without other grants. However, it became evident that the administration was spending NOK 2 million per year on the ferry service, and as the ferry soon would have to be replaced, this would increase to NOK 3 to 5 million per year. On 1 October 1990, the issue was considered by Hordaland Transport Board, which approved the plans. This was followed up by Hordaland County Council on 19 June 1991, which involved NOK 27 million being financed by debt and NOK 28 to 33 million being financed through reduced subsidies to the ferry.
The plans were met with criticism from locals on the Bergen side where the tunnel would emerge. They stated that the plans had "cheap solutions" and had unnecessary negative impact on their local environment. This included the demolishing of a football field and lack of noise barriers. Bergen Municipality demanded that the costs of a new field be paid for by the project, and that the tunnel be slightly extended. A new estimate was made, which increased the price by NOK 10.3 million; however, Hordaland Public Roads Administration protested, stating that it would give an inferior road technically, that the existing development plans permitted the construction, and that the noise would not exceed the permitted limits. They concluded that should these demands remain, the increased costs would terminate the project. On 16 November 1992, Bergen City Council voted to allow the tunnel, under the condition that the tunnel project financed a new football field. The decision was appealed by lawyers representing the local community, but this was rejected by Hordaland County Governor on 30 August 1993.
Originally the unlimited company Bjorøy og Tyssøy ANS had been attempted established with capital from locals, but instead the company Fastlandssambandet Bjorøy – Tyssøy AS was established on 29 September 1993. Capital for NOK 40,000 was paid by Fjell Municipality, NOK 20,000 by Sund Municipality and NOK 10,000 by Jack Jahnsen. The plans were sent to the Ministry of Transport and Communications in October 1992, who started working on a proposal for parliament in January 1993. Issues raised by the ministry were that the loans had been issued in 1987, and whether the land estimated value of the guaranteed real estate was real. The project was presented to the Parliament of Norway, who must approve all toll roads. By then the costs were estimated at NOK 61.5 million, including NOK 4.5 million in ordinary county grants and NOK 30 million in extraordinary county grants. The proposal estimated annual toll collection costs to NOK 825,000, with the collection taking place on Bjorøy. It was originally planned that the toll plaza would be manned between 06:00 and 22:00, meaning passing would be free at night.
An agreement was made between the ministry, the tunnel company and the county municipality on 6 January 1994 to build the tunnel. The company had the right to collect tolls for up to 15 years on fees dictated by the county municipality, and would have to pay NOK 27 million for the tunnel, with the county paying for the rest of the costs. The construction would be the responsibility of Hordaland Public Roads Administration, with the tunnel company only responsible for their part of the financing and the collection of tolls. An agreement was made with Selmer, whereby they would charge NOK 59,422,500 and take the risk of the project, including any expenditures for unknown geological conditions or similar costs increases. They were also responsible for an insurance to reclaim the investments should it be proven impossible to build the tunnel.
Construction.
The construction of the tunnel started on 29 September 1993, with the original plans calling for the tunnel to open on 15 June 1995. The original construction consisted of blasting from Bjorøy, but by January 1994 there were problems with water leaks through cracks. The contractor described these as "common problems" when building tunnels, but that construction would be delayed by up to two weeks. To keep up with the schedule, the company started also blasting from the mainland. However, the problems increased, and by September the tunnel was leaking per minute, which was 50% more than estimated. This caused extra work to be done on the exterior to the tunnel, and costs had increased by several tens of millions of krone. In particular, a different type of rock had been struck, and of concrete had been injected without this giving the desired effects.
On 30 September, Selmer stopped construction from the Bjorøy side, although it continued from the mainland. About from the Bjorøy side, the construction found a section of sandstone, the upper Jurassic Bjorøy formation, a condition that had never been encountered during subsea tunnel construction before. Geological engineers stated that there was no known solution to overcoming the problem, and that if the contractor had blasted into the area, the tunnel would have been filled with sand and water within minutes.
On a meeting on 10 October, O. T. Blindheim, a geological consulting company, and Selmer presented three alternatives: continued injection of cement, recommended by Blindheim; freezing, recommended by Selmer because it was the cheapest, but would take more time; and use of a water-tight shield. A technical committee was established, and on 16 December they recommended the use of cement injection combined with a ring of drainage holes around the tunnel before blasting. The method was to be continually tested, and if it was insufficient, freezing could be used. As the tunnel advanced, the hole was to be continuously secured using carbon fibre-reinforced carbon gunite, self-boring bolts, steel ribs and full pouring. Work was taken up after a meeting on 27 March 1995, and on 16 August the final blast was made. Representatives from Selmer stated that the method they had chosen had resulted in international interest for the tunnel, and they had demonstrated it to several international delegations.
Tolls and auxiliary roads.
The grants were only given for the tunnel to Bjorøy, and not for the necessary roads that would connect Tyssøy to Bjorøy. This caused local controversy, as some people on Bjorøy disagreed that the tolls on the Bjorøy Tunnel should pay for the Tyssøy Bridge. On 13 May 1993, the costs of the connection to Tyssøy were estimated at NOK 5 million. The issue was not resolved when the construction of the tunnel started. The original costs for the bridge were for NOK 11.4 million, including a long bridge with a clearance of . This was later reduced to length and , which reduced the costs to NOK 9.4 million. Of this, the county paid NOK 4 million, while the two municipalities had advanced the of transporting earthwork from the tunnel to the sound. On 22 January 1996, the tunnel company agreed to advance the construction costs and collect it from the tolls, with Sund Municipality guaranteeing for the debt.
On 2 February 1996, the tunnel company had an agreement with Bru og Tunnelskelskapet, which operates the Bergen Toll Ring, to collect the tolls in the tunnel using the Autopass automatic toll collection system. A manual collection system was estimated to cost NOK 1.4 million per year, while an automated system was estimated at NOK 0.4 million. The tunnel opened on 7 May 1996, the same day the last ferry ran. Originally the plan was to charge tolls similar to the ferry. With a manual system, it would not be possible to charge for two-wheeled vehicles and passengers, so the fares for other vehicles were raised slightly. In 1995, it had cost NOK 44 for a single passing with a car on the ferry. The tolls were set to NOK 120 for all types of vehicles, except two-wheelers, and NOK 72 was charged per travel with pre-paid ticket books. Bus riders had to pay for two extra zones. The toll plaza was open a few hour each week to allow people to purchase discounted tickets.
The contract for the construction of the bridge to Tyssøy was announced on 20 August 1996, and was won by NCC Eeg-Henriksen Anlegg, who wanted NOK 8.5 million for the job. The link opened on 27 September 1997. In 2000, a public meeting was held in which it was proposed to reduce the rates and instead prolong the collection time, but this was rejected. In 1999, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration reported that the Bjorøy Tunnel had the cheapest administration costs per passing, at NOK 7,32, of all small toll companies. The tolls were removed on 29 January 2005, after eight years and eight months, almost half the stipulated time.
On 19 January 2004, the freight ship "Rocknes" ran aground on the unmarked underwater bank of Revskolt in Vatlestraumen, located above the tunnel. The accident cost 18 people their lives and was the most extensive and costly oil spill in Norwegian history. In an attempt to avoid similar incidents occurring again, the Norwegian Coastal Administration started in May 2012 to blast away the bank, increasing the depth from . This allows the sailing width though Vatlestraumen to increase by . The work required the tarp covering the tunnel to be removed, causing increased leaks in the tunnel during the work period. The project was highly controversial amongst the islanders and the plans were approved by only a single decisive vote in the municipal council. Islanders were especially concerned that the work might damage the tunnel. Calculations conducted by the Coastal Administration conclude that there is no chance of this occurring, as the blasting is taking place above the tunnel.

George Arthur Keartland (11 June 1848 – 21 May 1926) was an Australian typographer and ornithologist notable for his collecting work on the Horn and Calvert scientific exploring expeditions.
Keartland was born in England at Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, but moved to Melbourne in Victoria, Australia with his family in 1850. He attended school in Fitzroy, trained as a photographer, completed an apprenticeship to a printer and became a compositor at "The Age" for over fifty years. Keartland joined the Melbourne Typographical Society in 1871 and served as president of the Australasian Typographical Union twice. In 1873 he married Margaret Jane Nicol, the couple settling in Collingwood.
From the mid-1880s Keartland became increasingly interested in natural history and, especially, ornithology. He joined the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria (FNCV) in 1886 and became expert at skinning birds. He served as the ornithologist/collector on the Horn Expedition to central Australia in 1894 as well as on the Calvert Expedition to north-west Australia in 1896-97, bringing back important collections of bird specimens from both.
Keartland was a founding member of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union in 1901 as well as serving as President of the FNCV in 1907-09. He died of cancer at his home in Preston, being survived by his wife, two of five sons and four of six daughters. He is commemorated in the scientific name of the Grey-headed Honeyeater ("Lichenostomus keartlandi").
Keartland is buried at Coburg Cemetery, Preston, Victoria. His grave is included in a self-guided heritage walk at the cemetery and information about his life is available on a sign posted at his graveside.

He joined the ranks of Hajduk Split, of which he stated to be an avid fan, in late June 2009. Not breaking through initially to the first team, he was sent on loan back to Varteks during the winter transfer season, losing, however, his place in the team in mid-March, due to the dispute of his two clubs regarding the transfer fee, but returning to the first team in May, scoring two goals in the last three games of the season. He remained on loan for the first half of the 2010–11 season, finding his position moved more and more moved to the right wing, and unable to regain his scoring streak. Returning to Hajduk Split, he was again sidelined, playing in only two games, one of which was 90 minutes against his former club. The following summer, he was again sent on loan to Varaždin for the 2011–12 season.

Truth window

A truth window (or truth wall) is an opening in a wall surface, created to reveal the layers or components within the wall. In a strawbale house, a truth window is often used to show the walls are actually made from straw bales. A small section of a wall is left unplastered on the interior, and a frame is used to create a window which shows only straw, which makes up the inside of the wall. 
Many designs exist for truth windows. Glass may be placed over the window, or an openable wooden panel, or it may be a simple framed opening.
The possible vulnerability of a truth window to moisture intrusion is sometimes raised as a concern.

After serving three different stints and working for four different head coaches at Mississippi State, Felker is considered one of the school's native sons.
Playing career.
Felker played quarterback at Mississippi State from 1972 to 1974 under coaches Charley Shira and Bob Tyler after a five-sport career at Brownsville High School in Tennessee. Helping lead Mississippi State to a 9–3 season and a win over North Carolina in the 1974 Sun Bowl, Felker continues rank in the program's top ten in multiple passing categories including: passing yardage (#9), pass completions (#10, 207), yards per attempt (#8, 6.98), passing efficiency (#7, 112.65), and touchdown passes (#7, 23). He is also ranked nine in total offense with 3,776 yards and seventh in total touchdowns accounted for with 35 (12 rushing and 23 passing).
Coaching career.
After serving as an assistant coach for three years at his alma mater, Felker served in several assistant coach capacities in the South, including Texas Tech University, Memphis State University, and the University of Alabama. After almost 10 years away from Mississippi State, Felker was called home to lead his alma mater, which was coming off four straight losing seasons. At 33, Felker was the youngest coach in the country and the first Mississippi State coach in 30 years to start his career with a winning record (6–5). However, this wouldn't last, and he suffered through four losing seasons (4–7, 1–10, 5–6, 5–6) between 1987 and 1990, and only won a total of five games in Southeastern Conference play. He was fired at the end of the 1990 season and replaced by Jackie Sherrill.
Since leaving his position as head coach, Felker has enjoyed a successful tenure as an assistant coach. After coaching at the University of Tulsa, and the University of Arkansas, Felker returned home at the request of Sherrill and continues to remain a staple of the Mississippi State staff.

Addison Road (album)

Addison Road is the self-titled debut album from Christian rock band Addison Road. It was released on March 18, 2008 and debuted at #182 on the "Billboard" 200. Three singles have been released off the album—"All That Matters", "Sticking with You" and "Hope Now". The first two singles were the 9th and 15th most-played songs on R&R magazine's Christian CHR chart for 2008.
Music and lyrics.
The band's musical style on "Addison Road" has been classified by many reviewers as a female-fronted mix of pop and alternative rock. The lead single "All That Matters" has a driving, anthemic rock sound backed by a pop beat, drawing comparisons with Maroon 5. "Sticking with You" has been described as synth-based with a pop/rock "dance-a-long feel". The album's first track, mid-tempo "This Could Be Our Day", has been compared to Leeland for being an "upbeat tune". The record slows down at the last track with the ballad "What Do I Know of Holy", which Jesus Freak Hideout labeled as lyrically "bringing out a deeper side of the band that was previously unheard earlier on the debut".
Release.
In November 2007, "Addison Road" was originally scheduled to release in the week of February 26, 2008. It reached #182 on the "Billboard" 200 within its first few weeks of release on March 18, 2008.
The album's first single, "All That Matters", was released early in January 2008, and quickly generated big success on Christian radio charts. It had reached the top ten on "R&R"'s Christian CHR chart by early February 2008, only five weeks later. For the week of February 12–19, the song was available as a free Discovery Download on iTunes and received over 165,000 downloads in that time. "All That Matters" was given an exclusive stream on Napster's website for the week of March 10, 2008, along with being featured on a handpicked Addison Road playlist of the band's favorite songs; this was unprecedented for a debut Christian music act. It was the ninth most-played song on R&R magazine's Christian CHR chart for 2008. 
The second single from the album, "Sticking with You", was released in mid-2008 and reached number two on "R&R"'s Christian CHR chart on October 17, 2008. The third hit single from the album was "Hope Now", it was also the theme song for the movie Letters to God. It ended 2008 as the fifteenth most-played song for the year on R&R magazine's Christian CHR chart.
Critical reception.
"Addison Road" garnered generally positive reception from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave it four stars writing that "At times, the group musters up enough energy and hooks to have a passing resemblance to Avril Lavigne, but this is hardly trash punk-pop: it's big music even at its quietest moments, and what's endearing about the group is that their utter sincerity is matched by a natural melodicism and sturdy songwriting, qualities that are easy to appreciate regardless of religious denomination." At New Release Tuesday, Sarah Fine gave it four-and-a-half stars praising the "Fresh beats and the consistant message of hope running through the album are sure to leave any listener satisfied." Kevin Davis also of New Release Tuesday rated it three-and-a-half stars noting that "Jenny Simmons has a nice voice and this is a promising debut album." At Cross Rhythms, Julie Porter rated it eight out of ten noting "the finely crafted songwriting, tight musicianship and the beautiful, distinctive vocals of Jenny Simmons leave you wanting to have this album on repeat so you can capture every last drop!" Liz Zelinski of Christian Music Review gave it a 91-percent evoking that "Addison Road has created an eclectic project, with wide-ranging rhythm that is entertaining and thoughtful." At Soul Shine Magazine, Lindsay Whitfield rated it four-and-a-half stars calling this "a seriously insightful and musically brilliant recording".
At "CCM Magazine", Lizza Connor Bowen gave it three stars stating that the music uses to many rote metaphors in their music calling the lyrics simplistically direct in the "upbeat anthems of exhortation and encouragement." Garrett DeRossett of Jesus Freak Hideout gave it three stars commenting that the have "produced a fine debut", but only "If they had attempted to step outside the box just a bit more, it would've made a world of difference." At "Christianity Today", Christa Banister rated it two stars cautioning that "Addison Road plays it much too safe to really make much of a memorable impact. Instead of embracing the scrappy and creative underdog spirit of a band who's fought so hard to make it, Addison Road takes the well-traveled road, making their debut just another so-so effort with a positive message. They're capable of much more than this."

John Hymers

John Hymers (20 July 1803 – 7 April 1887), mathematician, was born at Ormesby, near Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, the son of Thomas Hymers, a tenant farmer under Sir James Pennymon, and his wife, the daughter of John Parrington, rector of Skelton-in-Cleveland, England.
Education.
After attending schools at Witton-le-Wear and Sedbergh School, Hymers gained a sizarship at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1822. He graduated as second wrangler in 1826, and was elected fellow of St John's College in 1827.
Career.
For some years Hymers was a successful tutor of private pupils, and then became assistant tutor of his college in 1829 and tutor in 1832, and was moderator in the mathematical tripos in 1833–4. Hymers was an esteemed and conscientious tutor, but his most important influence was exerted through his mathematical textbooks. His "Treatise on the Analytical Geometry of Three Dimensions" (1830) was followed by his "Treatise on Conic Sections" (1837), which became the standard textbook on analytic geometry at Cambridge. Most of his books reveal a vast acquaintance with the development of mathematics on the continent. For instance, in the second edition of his "Integral Calculus" (1835) he introduced English students to the topic of elliptic functions, then newly discovered by C. G. J. Jacobi (1804–1851) working in Königsberg. Hymers was quick to appreciate any new mathematical technique; the most outstanding example concerns his use of differential operator methods for the solution of differential equations. In particular, his "Differential Equations and the Calculus of Finite Differences" (1839) incorporated the new solution of the Laplacian equation for the figure of the earth as given by Thomas Gaskin in symbolic form; it was the elaboration of this original solution by Robert Leslie Ellis in 1841 which led largely to George Boole's masterpiece "On a general method in analysis" in 1844 (PRS, 5, 1843–50). Boole's novel comprehensive method, which applied now to a wide class of differential equations important in physics, was, in its turn, presented by Hymers in the revised edition of his "Differential Equations" (1858) in a remarkably clear manner.
Hymers became a deacon in 1833 and was ordained priest in the following year. He received the BD (Bachelor of Divinity) in 1836 and was elected senior fellow of his college and fellow of the Royal Society in 1838. In 1841 he was Lady Margaret preacher, and received the DD (Doctor of Divinity); he was made president of his college in 1848. In 1852 he was presented by his college to the rectory of Brandesburton in Holderness, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, where he spent the last thirty-five years of his life. Appointed JP for the East Riding in 1857, his decisions as a magistrate were noted for their precision.
As a textbook writer, Hymers marked an era in the history of St John's College at Cambridge; he was also a good classical scholar. He numbered among his pupils J. W. Colenso and William Cavendish (1808–1891). He presented to the college library some manuscripts of Wordsworth, with whom he was distantly connected, and a portrait of Wordsworth was painted under his care for the college. An active traveller, Hymers enjoyed good health all his life. He died at Brandesburton on 7 April 1887. He was unmarried.
Legacy.
By his will of 24 August 1885, he bequeathed some of his property to the mayor and corporation of Hull, to provide for the foundation of a grammar school, "for the training of intelligence in whatever social rank of life it may be found among the vast and varied population of the Town." An obscurity in the wording of the will rendered the bequest invalid, but his heir, his brother Robert Hymers, voluntarily granted the sum of £50,000 for the establishment of Hymers College, Hull.

Frederick Palmer (engineer)

Frederick Palmer (1860–1934) was a British civil engineer.
Palmer was born in Carmarthenshire, Wales in 1860. Palmer undertook several projects at the West India Docks. The first was the construction of several sheds at the Import Dock between 1912 and 1917. Between 1926 and 1930 he built five more sheds at the South Dock and between 1929 and 1930 he constructed four more at the Export Dock.
Palmer served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) between November 1926 and November 1927. His son, John Palmer, made a bequest of an endowment fund to the ICE in 1960 to mark the centenary of his father's birth. The fund provides for a monetary prize and certificate for a paper submitted to the ICE on the subject of the economic and financial aspects of civil engineering.

Warri Crisis

The Warri Crisis was a series of riots and clashes between the Ijaw and the Itsekiri ethnic groups centered around the city of Warri in Delta State, Nigeria between March and May, 1997.
While the Ijaw and the Itsekiri have lived alongside each other for centuries, for the most part harmoniously, the Itsekiri were first to make contact with European traders, as early as the 16th century, and they were more aggressive both in seeking Western education and in using the knowledge acquired to press their commercial advantages. Until the arrival of Sir George Goldie's National Africa Company (later renamed the Royal Niger Company) in 1879, Itsekiri chieftains monopolized trade with Europeans in the Western Niger region. Despite the loss of their monopoly, the advantages already held by the Itsekiri ensured that they continued to enjoy an advantaged position relative to to that held by the Ijaw.
The departure of the British upon independence did not lead to a decrease in tensions between the Ijaw and the Itsekiri. With the discovery of large oil reserves in the Niger Delta region in the early 1960s, a new bone of contention was introduced, as the ability to claim ownership of a given piece of land now promised to yield immense benefits in terms of jobs and infrastructural benefits to be provided by the oil companies. Despite this new factor, rivalry between the Ijaw and the Itsekiri did not actually escalate to the level of violent conflict between the two groups until the late 1990s, when the death of General Sani Abacha in 1997 led to a re-emergence of local politics.
The title one of the city's traditional ruler, the Olu of Warri, was formerly known as the Olu of Itsekiri. When the title was changed by Awolowo's Western Nigeria government from Olu of Itsekiri to Olu of Warri in 1952, members of the other tribes (Urhobos, Isokos and Ijaws) saw this as an attempt to impose an Itsekiri ruler over them. The title dispute has led to series of clashes between the tribes in Warri over sovereignty.
In 1997, The Federal Government under the late Gen. Sani Abacha created a number of local government areas, including a Warri South-West Local Government Council, whose headquarters it located at Ogbe-Ijoh, in the Ijaw area of Warri. But due to Political pressure by the Itsekiri on the Federal Government, the headquarters of the same local government council was relocated to Ogidigben, an Itsekiri area of Warri.
Riots ensued, hundreds died, and six Shell Nigeria (SPDC) installations were taken over, leading to a drop in oil production. The crisis is known as the "Warri Crisis." The headquarters have since been relocated to Ogbe ijaw by the Delta State House of Assembly, a decision that brought relative peace back to the city.
The issue of local government ward allocation has proven particularly contentious. Control of the city of Warri, the largest metropolitan area in Delta State and therefore a prime source of political patronage, has been an especially fiercely contested area. This has given birth to heated disputes between the Ijaw, the Itsekiri and the Urhobo about which of the three groups are "truly" indigenous to the Warri region, with the underlying presumption being that the "real" indigenes should have control of the levers of power, regardless of the fact that all three groups enjoy ostensibly equal political rights in their places of residence.
The root of the Warri crisis is the Kiama Declaration of the Ijaws which was essentially a declaration that the entire Niger Delta Region of Nigeria belonged to the them. This of course is untrue as it is common knowledge that several other ancient ethnic groups like the Ibibios, the Itsekiris, the Andonis, the Urhobos, the Efiks, etc. alongside the Ijaws inhabit the area. The Warri crisis was the beginning of the implementation of the Kiama Declaration by the Ijaws. The Itsekiris, a tiny minority occupying lands containing some 40% of the total oil wealth of Nigeria, were a prime target of the Ijaws and they were to be a quick and gain as the Ijaws envisaged they could easily be runover, considering their status as a minoroty of minorities and the fact that they, unike the Ijaws, were unprepared for war. Simultaneously, in the hope of making quick work of the Itsekiris, the Ijaws took their expansionist agenda also to Edo State as well as to Ondo State where they were brutally halted by the majority ethnic groups in those States.
The trigger or opportunity for the commencement of the implementation of the Kiama Declaration and thus of the so-called Warri crisis was when the then Military Administrator of Delta State, Colonel David Dungs, unilaterally announced in a broadcast to the State that the Headquarters of the newly created Warri South-West Local Government Area was Ogbe-Ijoh, an Ijaw settlement, contrary to Ogidigben, an Itsekiri town, as was duly gazetted by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The Colonel Dungs maneuver is believed to have been sponsored by the Ijaws, he being not from the area but from far away Plateau State in North Central Nigeria and therefore ought not to have had any vested interest in the matter, and considering that the action was solely to the benefit of the Ijaws. That the Itsekiris put up no resistance initially buttresses this point. That the Ijaws commenced a war rather than a protest and even went on to "capture" and retain known traditional Itsekiri territories like Kantu and Okenrengigho (which they rechristianed "okenrenkoko" contrary to what is on every known map of the area) also buttresses the hegemonic mission of the Ijaws. The so-called Warri crisis therefore was not a crisis but a war of attrition waged by the Ijaws against their Itsekiri brothers with whom they had co-existed peacefully before advent of Ijaw nationalism.

Prospectus (book)

A book prospectus is a printed description of or advertisement for that book, usually issued before publication in an attempt to generate interest and advance orders. The word derives from Latin, meaning literally something which gives a view or prospect (in this case of a book). Some prospectuses are lavishly-produced, especially for private press books. 
Printed advertisements for and catalogues of books were produced in Europe as early as the 1470s, although very few survive and what we recognize today as prospectuses (containing information on the text, physical nature, price and availability of a forthcoming book) did not develop until the seventeenth century, when they were generally issued for books published by subscription. Prospectuses are of great interest to the historian and bibliographer because they often give information about a book, its author, publisher, printer or illustrator which is not available elsewhere.

<doc id="19830387" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19830387" title="Investment Policy Statement">
Investment Policy Statement

An Investment Policy Statement ("IPS") is a document, generally between an investor and the assisting investment manager, recording the agreements the two parties come to with regards to issues relating to how the investor's money is to be managed. In other cases, an IPS may also be created by an investment committee (e.g., those charged with making investment decisions for an endowment or pension plan) to help establish and record its own policies in order to assist in future decision-making or to help maintain consistency of its policies by future committee members or to clarify expectations for prospective money managers who may be hired by the committee.
The presence of an IPS helps to clearly communicate to all relevant parties the procedures, investment philosophy, guidelines and constraints to be adhered to by the parties. It can be seen as a directive from the client to the investment manager about how the money is to be managed, but at the same time the IPS should provide the guidelines for all investment decisions and responsibilities of each party. As a policy document rather than an implementation directive, the IPS should provide guidance for how investment decisions will be made; it should not be a list of the specific securities to be used.
When the investor is an individual client, as a general rule, the investment manager (or financial advisor) has the responsibility of creating the document, since the manager is generally more familiar with its purpose and normal content. Both the manager and the client generally sign the document, indicating acknowledgment of and agreement to its several parts. This can serve to protect both parties in the event of a future disagreement, as long as they have respectively adhered to the content of the IPS. A properly written investment policy statement can be critical in minimizing the legal liability of those serving in a fiduciary capacity (e.g., qualified plan trustees and trustees of irrevocable trusts, endowments, foundations and charitable trusts).
Today, use of an IPS with each investment client is now considered a best practice for investment managers and should be expected by clients hiring a professional investment manager.
The presence of an IPS helps to create an environment of transparency in the relationship between client and advisor. The IPS offers clients a better understanding of what to expect from their advisor. That clarity generally helps to build a much higher level of trust and respect and it helps ensure the investment manager is aware of the expectations of the client.
The regulatory environment.
There are two levels of legal and regulatory oversight: the legal requirements for clients who are fiduciaries or trustees for an account, and the regulations applicable to an advisor's practice. It is important to understand the requirements for each.
ERISA: a clear policy and prudent procedures.
An investment policy is required under virtually all investor circumstances, with the exception of individual investors. According to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), for every qualified company retirement plan (e.g., 401profit sharing, pension, 403[b) there are certain fiduciary responsibilities for managing the plan assets with the care, skill, prudence and diligence of a prudent expert and by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses. The IPS documents these fiduciary responsibilities and ensures fiduciaries are adhering to these responsibilities.
When auditing an ERISA plan, the U.S. Department of Labor regularly asks to review the associated IPS. The rationale for this request is in the Department of Labor Interpretive Bulletin 29 CFP 2509.94-2 which references ERISA Sections 404(a)(1)(A) and 404(a)(1)(B, specifically stating, “The maintenance by an employee benefit plan of a statement of investment policy designed to further the purposes of the plan and its funding policy is consistent with the fiduciary obligations set forth in ERISA Section 404(a)(1)(A) and (B). For purposes of this document, the term “statement of investment policy” means a written statement that provides fiduciaries who are responsible for plan investments with guidelines or general instructions concerning various types or categories of investment management decisions….”
Under ERISA, all qualified plan trustees have a special responsibility to “prudently” manage their plan assets for the sole benefit of the plan participants. ERISA and the Department of Labor have established the following prudent procedures for plan trustees:
A properly written IPS should help ensure compliance with these required procedures. The IPS sets forth the objectives, restrictions, funding requirements and general investment structure for the management of the plan’s assets, and provides the basis for evaluating the plan’s investment results. By establishing the criteria and procedures for selecting investments and investment managers, an IPS can minimize “Monday morning quarterbacking” if investment performance is disappointing.
An IPS also can help trustees communicate a plan’s investment guidelines and procedures to those assisting in the investment process, such as investment advisors or money managers. Finally, and most importantly, an IPS provides a guide for making future investment decisions. Having and using the policy statement compels the trustees to be more disciplined and systematic, which in itself should improve the odds of meeting the investment goals.
UPIA and other Recent Legislation: a focus on the total portfolio.
The Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA) is state-adopted legislation that governs the investment conduct of private family trusts. First enacted in 1994, it serves as the hallmark of subsequent legislation (as well as how the courts now interpret such requirements relating to ERISA). UPIA requires a written investment policy for every trust in which trustees manage assets for the benefit of others. UPIA formally requires a focus on the total portfolio, rather than following its earlier regulatory guidance that individual investments should be evaluated independent of whether or not they were appropriate for portfolio inclusion. The total portfolio is now the fiduciary’s central consideration when judging the trade off between risk and return. There are no more restrictions on the types of investments that can be included in the portfolio; the trustee can invest in anything that helps achieve the risk/return objectives of the trust and that meets the other requirements of prudent investing.
UPIA specifies that diversification is part of the definition of prudent investing. It also makes clear that if appropriate investment processes are in place and followed, the trustees will not be held responsible for the results. Under UPIA, the delegation of investment and management functions is permitted and encouraged. Establishing and maintaining an IPS facilitates such delegation.
Additional legislation.
The following two acts are substantially similar to UPIA; both require a written IPS.
Legal requirements for financial advisors and investment managers.
The regulatory environment is constantly evolving, but trends are currently moving toward greater consumer protection. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) member firms and Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are subject to two primary obligations in terms of consumer protection: “suitability” and “fair dealing.” RIA firms must satisfy additional fiduciary standards of care and client protection. Well thought-out procedures are critical to satisfying these requirements. An IPS can help satisfy regulatory auditors by documenting the appropriate implementation of these procedures.
FINRA member firms are subject to a “suitability” requirement; this is described in the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Rule 2310. When a broker recommends that a client buy or sell a particular security, that broker must have a reasonable basis for believing that the recommendation is suitable for that client. In making this assessment, the broker must consider the client’s risk tolerance, other security holdings, financial situation (income and net worth), financial needs and investment objectives, among other things. Registered Investment Advisors are subject to fiduciary standards for suitable recommendations.
In addition to the suitability requirement, brokers are subject to a “fair dealing” requirement which is also described in FINRA 2310. According to this rule, sales efforts will be judged on the basis of whether they can be reasonably said to represent fair treatment for the persons to whom the sales efforts are directed. An “obligation of fair dealing” means that brokers must have reasonable basis for believing that their securities recommendations are suitable for and appropriate to certain customers in light of the customers’ financial needs, objectives and circumstances.
A well-crafted IPS will include all the relevant information needed for the broker to establish that both the suitability and fair dealing requirements have been satisfied.
Additional requirements for Registered Investment Advisory firms.
RIA firms must be registered as providing investment management services with either the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or with the equivalent state office. RIAs have an even higher standard of care established by fiduciary standard to carry out their responsibilities with the utmost degree of “good faith, honesty, integrity, loyalty and undivided service of the beneficiary’s interest.” The good faith clause requires RIAs to act reasonably in order to avoid negligent handling of the beneficiary’s interests, and to not favor anyone else’s interest, including the fiduciary’s, over that of the client.
Whether or not fiduciary responsibilities have been satisfied is not determined by investment performance, but by whether prudent investment practices and standards were followed. To establish those practices and standards, the preparation of the IPS is one of the most important functions of the RIA. To emphasize its importance, in some SEC districts, SEC auditors are asking to see the IPS for a sampling of client relationships.
The Investment Process and How an IPS Fits into It.
The investment process can be seen as occurring in six steps, as described below. Many experts believe that the creation of the IPS is the single most important step in this process. All the other steps either lead into the IPS, or are directed by the IPS.
1. Initial discovery. The initial discussions and sharing of documents that allows both the client and the advisor to learn about one another. On the one hand, this might include learning about the client’s circumstances, goals, income needs, restrictions, current holdings, risk tolerance, etc. The client should also attempt to learn as much as possible about the investment manager's investment philosophy, practices and procedures.
2. Discussion and agreement. All the issues related to what is to happen between client and advisor should be placed on the table. Where there are questions or a lack of clarity exists, further discussion may be needed. Eventually the client and advisors need to come to agreement on issues such as the degree of client involvement, the asset allocation to be used, the kinds of instruments to be utilized (or not), how tax considerations will be treated, investment goals, needs for liquidity or income, investment restrictions, investment methodology, and responsibilities of each party to the other.
3. Creating the IPS. Once the agreements have been reached on the full list of issues and policies to be followed, they need to be recorded. This document will become the IPS. The client(s) and the advisor sign the document, signifying each party’s acknowledgment of the agreements.
4. Investment implementation. Until there is agreement between the advisor and client about the policies to be followed, no investment trades can responsibly happen. Once the IPS has been signed by all parties, the initial and ongoing trades can be implemented according to the “roadmap” provided by the IPS.
5. Ongoing communication. Meetings, reports and other communications will occur between advisor and client, generally as suggested in the IPS.
6. Monitoring and adjustment. Rarely does a portfolio stay as originally structured. The IPS should describe how the portfolio will be monitored for poor performers, how good performers will be identified, how (and if) re balancing and tax loss harvesting opportunities will be implemented, and it should address any other ways in which the investment manager will try to ensure that the portfolio will stay in line with the objectives set forth in the IPS.
Clients and their needs change over time. It is therefore important that the advisor periodically return to the first step "discovery" to make sure the client’s then-current needs and wishes are being addressed. Every year or two, the IPS should be reviewed by the client and the advisor to ensure continued agreement with its provisions.
What Should Be Included in an IPS?
First and foremost, nothing should be included in the IPS to which the advisor or client cannot commit and be sure will be implemented.
An IPS usually has five major components that should be unique to each client.
1. All key factual data about the client, including where the client’s assets are held, the amount of their assets under your management, and the identification of the trustees or interested parties to the account. This can be as detailed or as simple as desired.
2. A discussion and review of the client’s investment objectives, investment time horizon, anticipated withdrawals or deposits, need for reserves or liquidity, and attitudes regarding tolerance for risk and volatility.
3. Any constraints and restrictions on the assets, such as liquidity and marketability requirements, diversification concentrations, the advisor’s investment strategy (including tax management), locations of assets by account type (taxable versus tax-deferred), how client accounts that are not being managed (if any) will be handled, and any transaction prohibitions.
4. The security types and asset classes to be included in or excluded from the portfolio, and the basic allocation among asset categories and the variance (rebalancing) limits for this allocation.
5. The monitoring and control procedures and responsibilities of each party.
The IPS and the Advisor-Client Relationship.
The IPS development process lays the foundation for a successful relationship between advisors and clients. An important benefit of utilizing and IPS in clarifying needs, procedures and expectations is that clients have a better understanding of what the advisor is going to do with their money, and of their advisor’s approach. Clients have an opportunity to understand the reasons why each action is to be taken. As a result, clients tend to have more confidence in the advisor’s abilities.
Having that increased level of understanding and confidence becomes important when markets go through a down period. The IPS establishes investment guidelines and a framework for long-term investment thinking and can help calm nerves when things are particularly volatile.

Cardiff Docks

Cardiff Docks is a port in southern Cardiff, Wales. At its peak, the port was one of the largest dock systems in the world with a total quayage of almost . Once the main port for the export of South Wales coal, the Port of Cardiff remains active in the import and export of containers, steel, forest products and dry and liquid bulks.
History.
Following the development of the coal found in the Cynon and Rhondda valley's and Merthyr area of South Wales, the export of both coal and iron products required a sea connection to the Bristol Channel if economic volumes of product were to be created.
In 1794, the Glamorganshire Canal was completed, linking the then small town of Cardiff with Merthyr, and in 1798 a basin was built, connecting the canal to the sea. By the 1830s, Cardiff became the pre-eminent iron-exporting port, shipping almost half of British overseas iron exports; between 1840 and 1870, the volume of coal exports increased from 44,350 to 2.219 million tonnes.
Bute Docks.
Increasing agitation for proper dock facilities led Cardiff's foremost landowner, John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute, to promote the construction of the (West) Bute Dock, designed by Admiral William Henry Smyth and opened in October 1839. Just two years later, the Taff Vale Railway was opened, following much the same route as the canal. 
With the construction of the new East Bute Dock from 1855, designed by James Walker of Messrs. Walker & Burges and built by Thomas Cubitt's firm, its opening in 1859 resulted in coal supplanting iron as the industrial foundation of South Wales, with exports reaching 2 million tons as early as 1862.
Queen Alexandra Dock.
Frustration at the lack of development at Cardiff led to rival docks being opened at Penarth in 1865 and Barry, Wales in 1889.
These developments eventually spurred Cardiff into action, with the opening of the Roath Dock in 1887, and the Queen Alexandra Dock in 1907. By then, coal exports from the South Wales Coalfield via Cardiff totalled nearly 9 million tons per annum, much of it exported in the holds of locally-owned tramp steamers. By 1913, this had risen to 10,700,000 tons, making Cardiff the biggest coal exporting dock in the world.
Shipping.
Cardiff's first steamship was the Llandaff of 1865, and by 1910, there were some 250 tramp steamers owned at Cardiff, by prominent firms such as William Cory & Son, Morel, Evan Thomas Radcliffe, Tatem and Reardon-Smith. Each day, the principals of these companies would meet to arrange cargoes of coal for their ships in the opulent Coal Exchange in Mount Stuart Square. This trade reached its pinnacle in 1913, when 10.7 million tons of coal were exported from the port. After the First World War, there was a boom in shipping in Cardiff, with 122 shipping companies in existence in 1920. The boom proved short-lived, however; oil was growing in importance as a maritime fuel, and the terms of the Treaty of Versailles soon flooded Europe with cheap German reparation coal.
Railways.
The Taff Vale Railway was built to transport coal from the South Wales Valleys to the docks. Its headquarters were a currently derelict building in Cardiff Bay railway station. The building was turned into a railway heritage centre in 1979 by the Butetown Historic Railway Society. By 1994 the Society had started to run steam locomotive hauled passenger services up and down 500 metres of track. However, as the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation had no interest in the railway, the Society changed its name to the Vale of Glamorgan Railway and moved from the site in 1997 to Barry Island railway station.
Decline.
From 1910 onwards capacity issues meant that the more modern and less tidal Barry Docks took over as the largest volume export point of coal. Until the early 1920s, Cardiff docks continued to boom as a location for shipping companies, but the fall in demand for Welsh coal caused a dramatic fall in exports. By 1932, in the depths of the Great Depression which followed the General Strike in 1926, coal exports had fallen to below 5 million tonnes and dozens of locally owned ships were laid-up. Despite intense activity at the port during the Second World War and the attentions of the Nazi German Luftwaffe during the Cardiff Blitz, coal exports continued to decline, finally ceasing in 1964. In 1950, imports outstripped exports for the first time in the port's history. The 1970s saw a short-term import boom, and in the 1980s the port experienced a slight rise in traffic, while much of the former port area began to be regenerated into non-port uses. The port found a niche as an important local centre for general cargo operations.
Modern Port Facilities.
Cardiff now has three operational docks capable of handling ships of up to 35,000 tons deadweight. The port has transit sheds with of storage space, two overland distribution sheds totalling , and two timber sheds totalling , two specialist steel sheds, with overhead gantry cranes, totalling . There are 9 quayside cranes plus a range of mobile cranes. Cardiff's specialised facilities include a distribution terminal
and chill and cold storage for perishables.
Tiger Bay.
Tiger Bay was a local nickname for the general Cardiff Docks area, the evocative phrase deriving from the area's rough-and-tumble reputation. Merchant seamen arrived in Cardiff from all over the world, only staying for as long as it took to discharge and reload their ships: consequently many murders and lesser crimes went unsolved and unpunished, the perpetrators having sailed for other ports. In Victorian times, the name "Tiger Bay" was used in popular literature and slang (especially that of sailors) to denote any dock or seaside neighborhood which shared a similar notoriety for danger.
Cardiff Bay.
The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was created in 1987 to counter the effects of economic depression in this run-down area. Today, the port of Cardiff and what is now known as Cardiff Bay has been totally transformed by the Cardiff Barrage that impounds the Rivers Taff and the Ely to create a massive fresh-water lake across to Penarth Head. 
Only two docks, the Roath and the Queen Alexandra, remain in use, and just two shipping companies remain, albeit buoyant with their worldwide interests. Shipping movements varying from a couple of movements to 10 or 12 per tide, with trade in timber, oil, scrap and containers.

The song is included on several Muddy Waters' compilation albums, first appearing in 1958 on "The Best of Muddy Waters".
Muddy Waters later recorded the song for his 1978 album "I'm Ready", which was produced by Johnny Winter. The album earned Waters a Grammy Award in 1978.

At the Boar's Head

"At the Boar's Head" is an opera in one act by the English composer Gustav Holst, his op. 42. Holst himself described the work as "A Musical Interlude in One Act". The libretto, by the composer himself, is based on Shakespeare's "Henry IV, Part 1" and "Henry IV, Part 2".
Holst devised the idea for this opera in 1924, whilst convalescing from an illness. During this period, he alternated between reading "Henry IV, Part I" and an edition of John Playford's "The English Dancing Master", as well as folk melodies collected by Cecil Sharp and others. Holst noticed that the rhythm and metre of Shakespeare's lines matched the tunes in the Playford, as well as the tunes that Sharp and others had collected. He then decided to set a number of those melodies to a story assembled from episodes set at the Boar's Head Inn from the two parts of "Henry IV".
The opera received its first performance at the Palace Theatre in Manchester on 3 April 1925, by the British National Opera Company, with Malcolm Sargent conducting. A performance at the Golders Green Hippodrome followed on 20 April 1925, with the following singers among the cast:
Holst's opera was part of a double bill with Puccini's "Gianni Schicchi". The first US performance was in February 1935 in New York City, at the MacDowell Club, conducted and directed by Sandor Harmati.
Contemporary audiences overall gave the opera a lukewarm reception. Imogen Holst said of the opera that it contained "very little relief from the onslaught of the counterpoint". Hugh Ottaway has commented that another reason for the failure of the opera was that the music did not add sufficiently to the original texts.
Synopsis.
The opera observes classical unities of a single setting for the plot, with the events occurring in real time on a single day. The story focuses on the conversations between Falstaff and Prince Hal, and the characters who wander in and out of the Boar's Head Tavern in Eastcheap. Throughout the story, the sound of door knocks bring reminders of events happening in the world outside the tavern, including the marching of soldiers to war.
The story begins in late afternoon, as Bardolph, Gadshill and Peto sing and drink in an upstairs room at the tavern. Falstaff arrives, followed by Prince Hal and Poins, whom Falstaff accuses of cowardice, for not assisting him in an attempted highway robbery earlier that day. Falstaff exaggerates the story, until Prince Hal says that he and Poins had stolen from Falstaff money that had prior been taken from unarmed travellers.
The Hostess announces the arrival of a gentleman from Court, whereupon Falstaff and the others leave. After Prince Hal delivers a soliloquy, Falstaff and the others return with news that civil war has begun. Falstaff advises Prince Hal to rehearse what he will say to the King before he returns to Court. Prince Hal practices with Falstaff in the role of the King, and later the two trade roles.
Doll Tearsheet arrives, and Prince Hal and Poins don disguises to be able to observe her and Falstaff's behaviour. Falstaff asks for a song, whereupon the disguised Prince Hal sings the Shakespeare sonnet "Devouring Time, blunt though the lion's paws". Falstaff is displeased and interrupts with the ballad "When Arthur first in Court began", and the two songs continue in parallel. A distant march precedes a communication from Bardolph to Prince Hal, who must go to the Court at Westminster. Prince Hal and Poins remove their disguises and leave to the shouts of the outside crowd.
Pistol calls to Falstaff off-stage, and then enters the inn, in spite of the misgivings of Doll and the concern of the Hostess for the inn's reputation. Pistol and Doll argue vehemently, and Pistol is ejected. Bardolph arrives with word that a dozen captains are searching all the taverns for Falstaff. Falstaff bids Doll farewell, but at the end, before all the men go off to war, Bardolph brings a last message for Doll Tearsheet to meet Falstaff one last time. The hostess pushes Doll through the door to the assignation at the close of the opera.

The Wandering Scholar

The Wandering Scholar, Op.50 is a chamber opera in one act by the English composer Gustav Holst. The libretto, by Clifford Bax, is based on the book "The Wandering Scholars" by Helen Waddell.
The opera received its premiere at the David Lewis Theatre, Liverpool on 31 January 1934. The performance celebrated the laying of the foundation stone of Herbert James Rowse's Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, the successor to the previous Hall which burned down in 1933. Holst did not hear the live performance because he was too ill to attend. The manuscript contains notes in Holst's own hand such as "More harmony" and "Tempo?", which indicated that Holst had thoughts of revising the work. However, Holst did not revise the manuscript before his death in May 1934.
Benjamin Britten prepared a chamber-orchestra version of the score for performance, and this version was given at the Cheltenham Music Festival in 1951. In 1968, Britten and Imogen Holst edited the opera for publication.
Synopsis.
Louis is preparing to go to town to obtain provisions, and tries to kiss Alison before leaving, but she rebuffs him. After Louis departs, Alison pulls out a concealed almond-cake, a bottle of Burgundy, and pork, to entertain Father Philippe, who has designs on her. Father Philippe arrives, and makes a pass at Alison. She initially claims that she will not deceive her husband, but after she points out the attic and that the pork will take 20 minutes to cook, they start to move towards the attic. Just then, Pierre, a poor wandering scholar, arrives and begs for food. Alison is sympathetic to Pierre's plight, but Father Philippe wants Pierre to leave immediately. Alison allows Pierre to stay, finding him handsome. Pierre begins to tell his story. Father Philippe then brandishes Louis' cudgel and drives Pierre away.
Father Philippe then makes a second attempt to take Alison up to the attic, expressing concern about whether the ladder will bear his weight. Alison, however, hears Louis returning, and is concerned because she and Louis had no provisions when he had left for town. Alison and Father Philippe hide the cake, Burgundy and pork, and Father Philippe conceals himself. Louis and Pierre enter, with Louis asking Alison to provide food for Pierre. Alison protests that Louis was supposed to go to town to obtain provisions. Pierre begins to tell a tale about a herd of pigs, and lets slip that there is a piece of pork in the pot on the stove. Louis is stunned at this, and asks Alison if there is pork in the pot. Alison denies this, but Louis asks to take the lid off, which reveals the pork. Alison feigns surprise, and as Pierre continues his story of the pigs and a wolf, where the story parallels the earlier situation with him, Alison and Father Philippe. Alison protests that Pierre is some sort of demonic wizard who made the food magically appear, but Pierre finishes his tale with an allusion to a hidden priest who would have robbed them. Louis discovers Father Philippe and drives him out of the house. Alison brings the cooked pork to the table. Louis orders Pierre to sit at the table. Alison is about to do the same, but Louis orders her not to sit, and instead to go up to the attic. She obeys nervously, with Louis following her with his cudgel. Pierre settles down to food and drink as the curtain falls.

George Waddington

George Waddington (7 September 1793, Tuxford, Nottinghamshire – 20 July 1869, Durham) was an English clergyman, traveller and church historian.
Life.
He was the son of George Waddington (1754?-1824), vicar of Tuxford and Anne Dollond, youngest daughter of the optician Peter Dollond. He was educated at Charterhouse School from 1808 to 1811, and then entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted scholar in 1812.
His career at the university was distinguished. He was Browne medallist for the Latin ode in 1811, and for epigrams in 1814, Davies's university scholar in 1813, and chancellor's English medallist in 1813. He graduated B.A. in 1815, being senior optime in the mathematical tripos and the first chancellor's medallist, and in 1816 he was member's prizeman. He printed for circulation among his friends the Latin ode (1811) and his English poem "Columbus". Waddington was admitted minor fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1817, and major fellow in 1818; he proceeded M.A. 1818 and D.D. about 1840, and he was an original member of the Athenaeum Club, London on its foundation in 1824. He had in the meantime published (1822), in conjunction with the Rev. Barnard Hanbury, his "Journal of a Visit to some parts of Ethiopia", describing a journey from Wadi Halfa to Meroë and back. Waddington was responsible for the authorship and for the seventeen drawings in their original state. He next brought out in 1825 a discriminating and impartial account of "A Visit to Greece in 1823 and 1824", which passed into a second edition and in the same year. In 1829 he issued a volume on "The Present Condition and Prospects of the Greek or Oriental Church, with some Letters written from the Convent of the Strophades", which, when revised, was reissued in a new edition in 185. The letters were addressed to "T.", probably Bishop Thirlwall, his contemporary at school and college.
About 1826 Waddington was ordained in the English church, and in December 1827 he preached the sermon in the chapel of Trinity College on Commemoration day. He was presented by Trinity College to the perpetual curacy of St Mary the Great, Cambridge, on 1 February 1833, and on 17 June 1834 was presented by Trinity to the vicarage of Masham and Kirkby-Malzeard in Yorkshire, being also appointed on 1 October in that year commissary and official of the prebend of Masham. On 14 April 1833 he was collated to the prebendal stall of Ferring in Chichester Cathedral, and held it until 1841. He preached his farewell sermon at Masham on 27 December 1840.
Waddington was installed in the deanery of Durham on 25 September 1840, and became warden of the university in 1862. He died at Durham on 20 July 1869, and was buried on the north side of the cathedral yard. In 1870, in memory of him and of his brother Horatio (d.1867), his sisters founded the Waddington classical scholarship at Cambridge.
Works.
The best known works of Waddington are those on ecclesiastical history. The first of them described the "History of the Church from the Earliest Ages to the Reformation" (1833, 2 vols.; 2nd edition revised in 1835, 3 vols.) The other set of the "History of the Reformation on the Continent" (1841, 3 vols.) He also published some single sermons and addresses, and three lectures on "National Education in England".

Ratnangi

Ratnangi (pronounced ratnāngi, meaning "the one with a gem-like body") is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 2nd "melakarta" rāgam (parent scale) in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called Phenadhyuti in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 2nd rāgam in the 1st "chakra Indu". The mnemonic name is "Indu-Sri". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ra ga ma pa dha ni". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
The scale uses the notes "shuddha rishabham, shuddha gandharam, shuddha madhyamam, shuddha dhaivatham" and "kaisiki nishadham". As it is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "shuddha madhyamam" equivalent of "Jalārnavam", which is the 38th "melakarta" scale.
Asampurna Melakarta.
Phenadhyuti is the 2nd "Melakarta" in the original list compiled by Venkatamakhin. The notes used in the scale are the same, but the ascending scale is different.
"Janya" rāgams.
"Ratnangi" has a few minor "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it, of which "Revati" is very popular. See List of "janya" rāgams for full list of scales associated with "Ratnangi".
Compositions.
Here are a few common compositions sung in concerts, set to "Ratnangi".
The following composition is set to "Phenadhyuti".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Ratnangi's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 2 other "melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Gamanashrama" and "Jhankaradhwani". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. For further details and an illustration refer "Graha bhedam on Ratnangi".

The Perfect Fool

The Perfect Fool is an opera in one act with music and libretto by the English composer Gustav Holst. Holst composed the work over the period of 1918 to 1922. The opera received its premiere at the Covent Garden Theatre, London on 14 May 1923. Holst had originally asked Clifford Bax to write the libretto, but Bax declined.
In the score, Holst pokes fun at the works of Verdi, Wagner's "Parsifal" and Debussy. In the opera, the part of the Fool consists of only one word. One interpretation of possible symbolism of the opera, from Donald Francis Tovey, is that the Princess symbolises the world of opera and the Fool represents the British public.
The opera was not a success, and audiences had found the story confusing. Although the opera did receive a live BBC broadcast a year after its premiere, revivals of the work have been rare.
Ballet music.
The introductory ballet music is much more often performed, separately as a suite. The ballet music falls into the following sections:
Themes from the ballet music recur throughout the remainder of the opera.

Tanarupi

Tanarupi (pronounced tānarūpi, meaning "the one that embodies tanam") is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 6th "melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called Tanukeerti in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 6th rāgam in the 1st "chakra Indu". The mnemonic name is "Indu-Sha". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ra ga ma pa dhu nu". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
The notes used in this scale are "shuddha rishabham, shuddha gandharam, shuddha madhyamam, shatsruthi dhaivatham" and "kakali nishadham". As it is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "shuddha madhyamam" equivalent of "Raghupriya", which is the 42nd "melakarta" rāgam.
Asampurna Melakarta.
Tanukeerti is the 6th "Melakarta" in the original list compiled by Venkatamakhin. The notes used in the scale are the same, but the ascending scale and descending scale are different. It is an "audava-vakra sampurna" raga (5 notes in ascending scale, while full 7 are used in descending scale in a zig-zag manner).
"Janya" rāgams.
"Tanarupi" has no "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See List of "janya" rāgams for a full list of "janya" rāgams.
Compositions.
Here are a few common compositions sung in concerts, set to "Tanarupi".
The following composition is set to "Tanukeerti".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Tanarupi's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields no other "melakarta" rāgam. "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam.

Lucy v. Zehmer

Lucy v. Zehmer, 196 Va. 493; 84 S.E.2d 516 (1954) was a court case in the Supreme Court of Virginia about the enforceability of a contract based on outward appearance of the agreement. It is commonly taught in first-year contract law classes at American law schools.
Facts.
Defendant A. H. Zehmer and his wife Ida S. Zehmer owned a tract of land consisting of in Dinwiddie County, Virginia known as the Ferguson Farm. Plaintiff W. O. Lucy had known Zehmer for many years and had previously expressed interest in purchasing the farm. Some years prior to this case, Zehmer had agreed verbally to sell the farm to Lucy, but later reconsidered and declined to complete the sale. On December 20, 1952, Lucy entered the restaurant owned by Zehmer with a bottle of whiskey in his hand. He and Zehmer consumed a significant quantity of distilled spirits and discussed the possible sale of the farm. Zehmer wrote on a napkin stating simply "We hereby agree to sell to W. O. Lucy the Ferguson Farm complete for $50,000.00, title satisfactory to buyer". The note was signed by Zehmer and his wife. Zehmer later alleged that his wife had initially balked at his request that she sign the instrument, but she relented when Zehmer assured her that his intent to sell the farm was merely in jest.
The next day, Lucy spoke to his brother, J.C. Lucy, about the purchase, and hired an attorney to examine the title. After the attorney assured Lucy that the title was clear, Lucy wrote a letter to Zehmer asking when he intended to close the deal. In his reply, Zehmer insisted that he had never intended to sell the farm and that the note signed by him and his wife was written in jest, consistent with the jovial atmosphere and drunken camaraderie the parties were sharing that evening. Zehmer claimed on the witness stand that the circumstances were such that Lucy should have known he was too inebriated to agree to the sale. Depositions were taken and the decree appealed from was entered holding that the complainants had failed to establish their right to specific performance, and dismissing their bill.
Decision.
Judge Buchanan, who had served on the Supreme Court of Virginia since 1946, wrote for the majority and held that the record suggested that Zehmer was not intoxicated to the point of being unable to comprehend the nature and consequences of the instrument he executed, and that the circumstances surrounding the transaction were such that Lucy was justified in believing that it was a serious business transaction, rather than a mere jest. On this latter point, Buchanan quoted from the Restatement (First) of Contracts:
The mental assent of the parties is not requisite for the formation of a contract. If the words or other acts of one of the parties have but one reasonable meaning, his undisclosed intention is immaterial except when an unreasonable meaning which he attaches to his manifestations is known to the other party.
Buchanan further held that specific performance was the proper remedy for the plaintiff.

1997 Qayen earthquake

The Qayen earthquake, also known as the Ardekul or Qaen earthquake, was a major earthquake that struck Northern Iran's Khorasan Province on May 10, 1997 at 07:57 UTC (12:57 local time). The largest in the area since 1990, the earthquake measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale and was centered approximately south of Mashhad on the village of Ardekul. The third earthquake that year to cause severe damage, it devastated the Birjand–Qayen region, killing 1,567 and injuring more than 2,300. The earthquake—which left 50,000 homeless and damaged or destroyed over 15,000 homes—was described as the deadliest of 1997 by the United States Geological Survey. Some 155 aftershocks caused further destruction and drove away survivors. The earthquake was later discovered to have been caused by a rupture along a fault that runs underneath the Iran–Afghanistan border.
Damage was eventually estimated at $100 million, and many countries responded to the emergency with donations of blankets, tents, clothing, and food. Rescue teams were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris. The destruction around the earthquake's epicenter was, in places, almost total; this has been attributed to poor construction practices in rural areas, and imparted momentum to a growing movement for changes in building codes. With 1 in 3,000 deaths in Iran attributable to earthquakes, a US geophysicist has suggested that a country-wide rebuilding program would be needed to address the ongoing public safety concerns.
Background and geology.
Iran experiences regular earthquakes, with 200 reported in 1996 alone. Like dozens that had preceded it, the 1997 Qayen event was of significant magnitude. It occurred on Saturday, May 10, 1997, at 12:57 IRST in the Sistan region, one of the most seismically active areas of the country. The first major earthquake in that region since 1979, it registered 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw), 7.2 on the surface wave magnitude scale (Ms), 7.7 on the energy magnitude scale (Me), and had a maximum perceived intensity of "X", or "disastrous" on the Mercalli scale.
The earthquake was caused by a rupture along the Abiz Fault, part of the Sistan suture zone of eastern Iran. Located northeast of the main collision zone between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates, the Sistan zone marks the eastern boundary of the Iranian microplate where it intersects with the Afghan crustal block. Most of Iran is contained on one microplate, causing seismic activity mainly along its borders. Both the 1968 Dasht-e-Bayez earthquake (magnitude 7.3, resulting in 12,000–20,000 deaths) and the Qayen earthquake were the results of strike-slip faults, meaning that the crustal blocks on either side of the faults shifted against each other horizontally. The Qayen earthquake was caused by right lateral movement along the Abiz Fault. In addition to the dominant strike-slip displacement, there was also local evidence of reverse faulting. The average displacement of about 2 m indicates a low static stress drop, more consistent with an interplate earthquake than an intraplate event. The maximum horizontal acceleration during the quake was approximately 6.9 meters per second—nearly three-quarters of the acceleration an object would have in free fall—and occurred near the earthquake's epicenter. The crustal layer involved in the rupture was thick. The surface fault that caused the earthquake extended for , which was longer than would be expected given the earthquake's magnitude. There were at least 155 aftershocks, reaching a magnitude of up to 5.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. Many of the aftershocks occurred along the rupture up to below the surface.
The earthquake's epicenter was within the village of Ardekul in South Khorasan Province, which borders Afghanistan. The village is isolated between mountains and hills. Although the Iranian government had distributed more than 800 seismographs throughout the country, few had been placed in the Qayen region due to its desert climate and the remoteness of the area.
As a result of the dry climate, timber—a main component in building earthquake-resistant homes—is scarce in Qayen; homes are instead constructed of adobe. The inhabitants of the poverty-stricken region rely on subsistence farming, raising livestock and crops such as wheat and saffron. When the earthquake struck, much of the population was already working in the fields; for the most part, these people survived. Many of those treated for injuries were found to be undernourished.
Damage and casualties.
The earthquake was felt over an area of , including in the cities of Mashhad, Kerman and Yazd. Destruction was most severe within a strip between the epicenter and Birjand. The tremors triggered landslides across the region and proved highly destructive to the region's mud-hut buildings. Entire streets were reduced to rubble, and in one village, 110 young girls were killed when their elementary school collapsed.
An initial report in "The New York Times" claimed that more than 2,000 people had died in the worst-affected area, with a further 394 in Birjand and two in the small town of Khavaf. The earthquake was also said to have caused five fatalities in Afghanistan. As rescue efforts proceeded these figures were revised; the United States Geological Survey states that 1,572 people were killed and as many as 2,300 injured. As bodies were retrieved, they were buried in mass graves. Officials worried that a temperature fluctuation—from on the day of the earthquake—would cause the corpses to rot more quickly, spreading infection.
Many villages lost both power and water, leaving survivors unable to fend for themselves. The injured were often up to away from the nearest hospital. One doctor, highlighting the desperate need for physicians to treat the injured, said "I don't know how many casts I have done today, but it seems like hundreds."
The extensive aftershocks prompted survivors to leave the vicinity of their homes and take to tents. Several days later, another earthquake of magnitude 4.8 struck. In the wake of the earthquake and its aftershocks, every one of the 700 houses in the tiny village of Abiz, east of Qayen, was destroyed, and 400 of its 1200 residents killed.
According to an Iranian radio station report, 200 villages sustained severe damage or were totally destroyed. The United States Geological Survey estimated that 10,533 houses were destroyed; an additional 5,474 homes sustained varying degrees of damage. Fifty thousand people were left homeless. Local officials initially estimated the cost of the damage at $67 million 1997 US$ (roughly 89.5 million 2008 USD). The estimate was later raised to 100 million 1997 USD (roughly 133.6 million 2008 USD). One hundred schools and many health centers in the stricken areas were discovered to be in need of repair work.
Many of the more seriously damaged homes were of simple construction, with walls made of mud, adobe, or brick packed 40–50 cm (16–20 in) thick. These materials are generally more vulnerable to the force of the earthquake. However, some of the traditionally constructed homes sustained little or no damage. This was due to a range of factors, possibly including the height-to-width ratio, the lack of windows, and the quality of the materials used. In general, reinforced concrete-framed homes, built after the 1979 earthquake, were better able to withstand the earthquake. Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due to the weight of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings.
Relief efforts.
Several thousand volunteers were brought in to join the search for survivors buried under mounds of brick and cement debris. Many volunteers worked with nothing but their hands. Local organizations, including the Iranian Red Crescent, sent 9,000 tents, more than 18,000 blankets, canned food, rice, and dates. An additional 80 tons of supplies were sent by the Iranian government to Mashhad, from where the relief efforts were being coordinated.
The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, pleaded that the international community "respond promptly and with generosity". France dispatched a cargo plane filled with blankets, tents, clothing, and food, while Swiss authorities sent a rescue team with dogs trained in search-and-rescue. Several aircraft carrying tents, blankets, and kerosene stoves from European and Arab countries arrived in Mashad on May 14. Representatives from the United States, calling the disaster a "humanitarian issue", said that despite their strong differences with Iran they would donate supplies and other aid if requested. The Mennonite Central Committee, an American relief agency stationed in Akron, Pennsylvania, redirected to the relief effort 400 metric tons of lentils and cooking oils intended for immigrant refugees. A specialist British disaster rescue organisation, the International Rescue Corps, offered to send a team but were refused visas (with the reasoning that "enough rescue crews had already arrived at the disaster site") and a Swiss offer of additional assistance was also turned down. Several countries within the Persian Gulf political region sent condolences to the families of victims and the government in the area.
Because the affected area is extremely remote, distributing the relief supplies was difficult. Reaching some villages would require a five-hour drive over unpaved roads, some of which had collapsed or had been covered by landslides during the earthquake. Helicopters were used to provide supplies to some otherwise inaccessible areas.
Although aid operations continued for some time, the Iranian government ceased rescue work on May 14. No more survivors were expected to be found in the rubble.
Future threats.
Iran was listed as "the worst offender" in a 2004 report on countries with poor earthquake engineering. Professor Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado at Boulder, a geophysicist who specializes in earthquake-related deformation and hazards, blames construction practices for the fact that since the start of the 20th century, 1 in 3,000 Iranians has died in an earthquake-related incident. Bilham argues that "Most of Iran needs rebuilding." The United Nations have prepared a Common Country Assessment for Iran, which likewise states that, "While adequate building regulations exist for large cities, it is generally believed that they are not rigorously adhered to... most of those who have suffered in recent major earthquakes have lived in small towns and villages. Earthquake-proof construction is very rare in those areas and adequate building regulations are not yet in place". An analysis of the performance of traditional buildings during the earthquake concluded that several factors, including high construction costs, poor materials, a shortage of skills in rural areas, and a lack of building regulations governing traditional construction techniques, have led to a deterioration in the quality of such buildings. The study recommended regulations to govern the construction of traditional arches and domes.
The earthquakes of Iran are a large concern to the populace and are an impediment to economic development. Twelve earthquakes with a Richter magnitude of over seven have occurred within the last century. Three-quarters of the major cities of Iran are in areas prone to major earthquakes. The 1990 Manjil-Rudbar earthquake, with at least 42,000 fatalities, cost Iran roughly 7.2 percent of its Gross National Product (GNP) for that year and wiped out two years of economic growth.
In 2007, the Asian Centre on Seismic Risk Reduction was formed in response to the regular earthquakes experienced by the southern, southwestern, and central Asian areas. This organization exists to "encourage regional and inter-regional networking and partnerships to reduce seismic damage". Earthquakes account for 73 percent of natural disaster deaths in the area.

Rouwaida Attieh

Rouwaida Attieh () is a Syrian vocalist, born in Talklakh, Syria, 40 kilometers from Homs (ancient Emesa). She has four siblings, Fatima, Haitham, Zainab, and Shaima'. Rouwaida was the first runner-up on the first season of Super Star, the pan-Arab import of "Pop Idol". Along with Lebanese contestant Melhem Zein, she was a favourite to win the contest, which was won by Jordanian contestant Diana Karazon.
Biography.
Rouwaida is the daughter of Haydar and Najida Attieh. Her father was brought up in Tripoli, Lebanon, where he studied and graduated from High School. He met Najidamoved when he moved to Egypt to specialize in law. The couple married and came back to Lebanon, where Najida was introduced to Laila Baroudi and they became best friends, Laila had a girl called "Obayda" whom Najida always described as "so beautiful" and decided to call her first new born baby girl "Obayda".
From her early childhood, Rouwaida used to watch Umm Kulthum's concerts on TV and she learned "Enta 3omry" when she was five years old. Her father was fascinated by her talent and he encouraged her. She studied music and playing oud (an oriental musical instrument) and she was a member in many clubs for preserving the folklore of the Arabic songs.
Rouwaida has quickly risen to fame thanks to the sheer power of her voice, and her skill in using it. Her deep and expressive voice helps her excel in the classical Arabic tarab style and the Levantine dabke style. She has worked with countless Arab musical giants, such as Lebanese composer Imad Shamseddine (credited with most of Najwa Karam’s success), Lebanese legend Wadih El Safi, and Egyptian composer Salah El Sharnoubi (credited with much of Warda’s later hits).
In 2003 Rouwaida participated in Super Star 1, she reached the finals and won the hearts of millions of the people in the Arab World.
Career.
On the 28th of April, 2004 she released her first album "Min Nazra" which was stunning and then she released a video clip for "te3bt ma3ak" song which also was a great success. In this clip Rouwaida proved that besides her great voice she's also a great actress and naturally gifted.
Since Super Star she has participated in many concerts and festivals in Syria such as "2al3it el7osn","mashta el7elo"….. She also had charitable concerts to entertain and enjoy the elderly.
In 2004 she received the award of the "best rising singer" from Tunisia and won the title of the "best Arab singer" for two years in a raw 2004-2005. In 2005 she put her final touches on her album "Khisamak Mur" which was a hit. In 2007 she released another hit “ Ma Tmalekny Eldny.
2008 was a prosperous year for Rouwaida,she released “Hayati Melki” & “Ana Andi Lezzi”,”Zourou Souria” & “Ya Tunis Alli El rayih” they all had a great success & Rouwaida had a great comeback to stardom. She had many concerts in Dubai, Algeria, Qatar, Syria, Lebanon and Tunisia. She had a duet with the great Lebanese singer Wadih El Safi “Hayda Lebnen” contributed to the Lebanese. Another duet was with Assi Hellani "Sahra Alshark" in 2008.
In 2009, she released her latest album Esma'ani, which includes the songs Bala hob and Shu sahl el haki.

(sic)nesses

(sic)nesses is the fourth video album by American metal band Slipknot, released on September 28, 2010. The double-disc release features a recording of their headlining performance at the 2009 Download Festival, along with a 45-minute behind the scenes documentary created by percussionist Shawn Crahan, and the four music videos from "All Hope Is Gone". It is the band's first release since the death of the band's former bassist Paul Gray and is dedicated in his memory. On September 22, 2010, "(sic)nesses" premiered in select theaters across the United States. Entrance to the screenings were free and it included free giveaways. Reception was generally positive, with Artistdirect rewarding the album a perfect five out of five stars, and Blabbermouth.net giving the album eight and a half out of ten stars. The album peaked at number one on four charts: the Australian Top 40 Music DVD Chart, the Finland Top10 Music DVDs, the UK Top10 Music DVD Chart, and the US Top Music Video Chart.
Recording and production.
"(sic)nesses" was recorded when Slipknot headlined the Download Festival in front of 80,000 fans on June 13, 2009. The show at Donington Park was filmed with 30 cameras. The 45-minute film "audible visions of (sic)nesses" features Slipknot during and in-between gigs on the All Hope Is Gone World Tour. Shawn Crahan stated that, "Going in and filming this, it just seemed like there was no way it could fail. It was going to be in the top five best shows of our careers, and that's basically what it was: we got off the stage and all nine of us felt the same thing, we knew that we destroyed 80,000 people. Watching it back just brings tears to my eyes."
The DVD was released as a dedication to the band's former bassist Paul Gray, who died of an accidental drug overdose on May 24, 2010. Roadrunner Records said the following about the DVD's release: "It makes perfect sense that the band…would release "(sic)nesses"…All Slipknot shows are memorable, but this one is particularly memorable, as the band blasted through hits from all of their Platinum albums. On stage is Slipknot in its most natural state and "(sic)nesses" will put you in the front row."
The live performance of "Psychosocial" was premiered on MSN in mid-September. The DVD premiered in a collection of theaters across the United States on September 22, 2010, prior to its commercial release. Screenings included Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Carmike Cinemas, Krikorian Theaters, Rave Motion Pictures, UltraStar Cinemas, Studio Movie Grill, Bow Tie, Santikos Theatres, Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, Emagine Entertainment, Cleveland Cinemas, Cinema Café and the Regent Theater. Crahan attended the New York event on September 27 as part of the promotion. Viewings were free and several prizes were given away randomly throughout the night at all three events. Crahan stated that “(sic)nesses was one of the single hardest pieces of art for us to complete, given the circumstances..." It was mixed at Miloco Studios in London, England, and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York.
Reception.
The album's reception was generally positive. The album's description on Roadrunnerrecords.com stated: "The performance was absolutely electric, in typical Slipknot fashion, especially since it came hot on the heels of one of the strongest years in Slipknot’s illustrious career." Rick Florino from Artistdirect gave the album five out of five stars. Florino introduced the DVD by writing: "it's an eerie, engaging and utterly entrancing collection of violently vibrant vignettes showing the greatest metal band of the 21st century at the top of their game—and the genre." Scott Alisoglu from Blabbermouth.net gave the album eight and a half out of ten stars. He called it the "ultimate tribute" to bassist Paul Gray. He also noted that things like display of controlled echos, the 80,000 person audience, their energetic performances of songs from their first album, and the "unforgettable anthems" like "Before I Forget" and "Psychosocial" came together to "remind naysayers and fans alike that Slipknot has a dearth of rivals when it comes to live performance." In its first week the album sold 9,300 copies in the United States.

Gerda Gilboe

Gerda Gilboe (5 July 1914 – 11 April 2009) was a Danish actress and singer. She appeared in 18 films between 1943 and 2003.
The daughter of a blacksmith, Gilboe started her career in musical theatre and operas in Aarhus before she moved to Copenhagen to work at different theatres. Her national breakthrough came, when she on short notice accepted the role as Eliza in "My Fair Lady" at Falkoner Teatret in 1960. Although she was then in her mid-40s and had only five days to learn the part, the production was a huge success.
In the following years she took on more and more non-singing roles, and besides her theatre career she took a degree in rhetoric. Later in her life she started teaching rhetoric and drama. She appeared in several films, receiving particular acclaim for her appearance as Esther in the film "Carlo & Esther" (1994).
Death.
Gilboe died on 11 April 2009 at an actors' home in Copenhagen, aged 94.
