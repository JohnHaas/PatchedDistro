Billibellary

Billibellary (c. 1799-1846) was a song maker and influential ngurungaeta of the Wurundjeri-willam clan during the early years of European settlement of Melbourne. He was known by various names including Billi-billeri, Billibellary, Jika Jika, Jacky Jacky and Jaga Jaga. He was an astute and diplomatic leader, described as powerfully built with an influence and reputation that extended well beyond his clan.
Clan Territories.
Billibellary's family lived on the north bank of the Yarra from Yarra Bend Park, and up Merri Creek. His brother, Burrenupton lived on the southern bank of the Yarra upstream of Gardiners Creek. Bebejan, also known as Jerrum Jerrum and was the father of William Barak, lived on the Yarra River from Heidelberg up to Mount Baw Baw. Mooney Mooney, a ngurungaeta of the Baluk-willam clan occupied land from the southeast of the Yarra River to Dandenong, Cranbourne and the marshes near Western Port.
Old Ninggalobin, ngurungaeta of the Mount Macedon clan, shared joint custody with Billibellary of the Mount William Quarry which was a source of the highly valued greenstone hatchet heads, which were traded across a wide area as far as New South Wales and Adelaide. The Quarry had been in use for more than 1,500 years and covered 18 hectares including underground pits of several metres. In February 2008 the site was placed on the National heritage list for its cultural importance and archeological value.
Ninggalobin, Poleorong and Billibellary were the leading song makers and principal Wurundjeri leaders in the Melbourne region. European colonisation had caused disruptions to initiation ceremonies. In response these three men gathered at South Yarra and inducted the young William Barak into Aboriginal lore. This entailed formally presenting Barak with the symbols of manhood: strips of pussumskin tied around his biceps; the gombert (reed necklace) around his neck; given his ilbi-jerri, a sharp and narrow bone or nosepeg; and his branjep, the apron worn by men to cover their genitals. At the end of the ceremony Barack presented his uncle, Billibellary, a possumskin cloak.
Treaty.
When John Batman explored the Yarra river and its tributaries he met Billibellary, one of the eight ngurungaeta he signed a treaty with on 8 June 1835. The meeting took place on the bank of a small stream, likely to be the Merri Creek and treaty documents were signed along with exchanges of goods by both sides. For a purchase price including tomahawks, knives, scissors, flannel jackets, red shirts and a yearly tribute of similar items, Batman obtained about 200,000 hectares (2,000 square km) around the Yarra River and Corio Bay. The total value of the goods has been estimated at about GBP100 in the value of the day. In return the Woiwurrung offered woven baskets of examples of their weaponry and two Possum-skin cloaks, a highly treasured item. After the treaty signing, a celebration took place with the Parramatta aborigines with Batman's party dancing a corroboree.
The treaty was significant as it was the first and only documented time when European settlers negotiated their presence and occupation of aboriginal lands. The Treaty was immediately repudiated by the colonial government in Sydney. The 1835 proclamation by Governor Richard Bourke implemented the doctrine of ""terra nullius"" upon which British settlement was based, reinforcing the concept that there was no prior land owner to British possession and that Aboriginal people could not sell or assign the land, and individuals could only acquire it through distribution by the Crown.
Clash of Cultures.
In response to tending an injury and caring for his son Simon Wonga for a period of two months in 1840, Billibellary named his newly born daughter Susannah in honour of Susannah Thomas, the wife of Assistant Protector William Thomas.
In January 1840 near Arthurs Seat William Thomas promised the gathered Kulin clans government rations until they could set up a self-sufficient community, but Chief Protector George Augustus Robinson had refused to release Government supplies. Fearing for his wife and children Thomas spoke to Billibellary and explained the non arrival of the rations, and asked for protection for his wife and children. Even though Billibellary was out of his territory, his authority was unquestioned. Thomas reported that Billibellary said "Very good that Mr Fawkner and Batman...Big one Gammon (pretend) your Mr Robinson and Government". Susannah Thomas released all the stores she could spare and Billibellary ordered the clans to split up into smaller groups for foraging.
On the instructions of Charles La Trobe a Native Police Corps was established and underwritten by the government in 1842 in the hope of civilising the aboriginal men. As senior Wurundjeri elder, Billibellary' cooperation for the proposal was important for its success, and after deliberation he backed the initiative and even proposed himself for enlistment. He donned the uniform and enjoyed the status of parading through the camp, but was careful to avoid active duty as a policeman to avoid a conflict of interest between his duties as a Wurundjeri ngurungaeta. Participation in the police corps also failed to stop troopers participating in tribal ceremonies, gatherings and rituals.
After about a year Billibellary resigned from the Native Police Corps when he found that it was to be used to capture and even kill other natives. He did his best from then to undermine the Corps and as a result many native troopers deserted and few remained longer than three or four years.
In 1845 a school was established on the banks of the Merri Creek to educate and "civilise" Wurundjeri children. For the first year or two the school enjoyed strong enrolments, largely due to the support and encouragement of Billibellary, who sent his own children along. But there were conflicts over teaching European curriculum and the demands for the teaching of aboriginal lore and ceremony. The death of Billibellary in 1846 led to a drop in student numbers at the school, with many students drifting away and others becoming "disruptive".
Death.
Billibellary died on 10 August 1846 of inflammation of the lungs, an ailment which killed many of his people in the period after contact with Europeans. Billibellary was buried at the confluence of the Merri Creek and the Yarra river (Birrarang) near Dights Falls. His passing was lamented by Thomas who had developed a deep friendship and mutal respect across cultures. He wrote of Billibellary after his death: "It may be said of this Chief and his tribe what can scarce be said of any tribe of located parts of the colony that they never shed white man's blood nor have white men shed their blood. I have lost in this man a valuable councillor in Aboriginal affairs."
After his death, his son Simon Wonga became ngurungaeta of the Wurundjeri-willam clan.

Bloom Cigar Company

The Bloom Cigar Company is an iconic and internationally known Pittsburgh-based premium cigar store. Founded in 1955, Bloom Cigar Company is the Pittsburgh area's largest retail and wholesale distributor of cigars. An weekly informal gathering of cigar aficionados and a unique ambiance contribute to its reputation. 
History.
The history of Bloom Cigar Company dates to the 1920s, when it was operated by the great uncle of the current owner, Marc Adams, who has run the store in its current incarnation since 1955. Bloom Cigar Company is now the largest wholesale and retail cigar store in Pittsburgh, supplying cigars online and at the South Side location. Bloom Cigar is the cigar supplier for Primanti Brothers, famous for their unique Pittsburgh-style sandwiches.
The interior of the store creates a unique ambiance; the walls are lined with photos of famous cigar smokers, including Terry Bradshaw and Art Rooney, and dozens of bras donated by female customers in exchange for a free cigar hang from the ceiling 
Cigar Camp.
In the early 1990s, Adams turned an ad hoc group of cigar connoisseurs that gathered at the store on Saturday mornings into "Cigar Camp," described as a "safe haven" for Pittsburgh's cigar lovers. Cigar Camp has developed a cult status, growing by word of mouth and attracting regulars and out of towners. Adams estimates that 30-40 men attend "Cigar Camp" at any time, with 150 attending throughout the day. Bloom Cigar purchased the adjacent building to expand Cigar Camp and added a large-screen television and other amenities. The modifications expanded the humidor by 66% and displaced some of the original lounging area that had been reserved for Cigar Camp, riling some of Bloom's regular customers. "Cigar Camp" is a registered trademark.
Notoriety.
The Pennsylvania Attorney General, in his investigation centering on the 2006 Pennsylvania General Assembly bonus controversy, discovered that former employees of the Pennsylvania House Democratic Caucus rented an office above Bloom Cigar to create a phony job for a staffer's mistress, who was then a 21-year-old former legislative intern and graduate student. The grand jury's presentment described the office as "dingy" and was "used as a cigar-smoking spot by individuals who came up from the cigar store." Marc Adams is a friend of former Pennsylvania House Majority whip Mike Veon, who has been charged by the Attorney General in connection to the 2006 legislative bonus investigation.
The store was used to film scenes in the feature film "10th & Wolf", about a Philadelphia mob war that was filmed in Pittsburgh. Owner Marc Adams has spoken out in the media against the now-repealed Allegheny County smoking ban and in favor of the new Pittsburgh Police public urination patrols in the South Side area.

Coming Out (2000 film)

Coming Out is a 2000 South Korean short film directed by Kim Jee-woon.
Plot.
The film opens with a man being interviewed about his sister, who has recorded a video diary in which she makes a shocking confession to her friends and family. Purporting to be a true story, the bulk of the film is presented as a reconstruction of actual events.
Hyun-yoo announces to her younger brother Jae-min and his girlfriend Ji-eun that she has an important confession to make, and asks them to record it on video. After issuing an apology to her parents, she reveals that she has been hiding a painful secret and is not like normal people; she is in fact a vampire. Jae-min and Ji-eun initially think she is playing a prank, but to prove her sincerity Hyun-joo bites into her wrist and starts to suck her own blood. She goes on to disclose further details of her life as a vampire, and dispels many of the common myths associated with the legend. Having heard of others like her overseas, she has decided to join a community of vampires living in England.
Going out at night to attract less attention, Jae-min films his sister as she feeds on a young woman in a telephone box. He and Ji-eun later talk to the woman, who remains unharmed, and she tells them that the experience was not painful, likening the sensation to an electric shock. The events prove to them that Hyun-joo is telling the truth.
Some time later, Ji-eun visits Hyun-joo who is now living in England. Curious to know how it feels being bitten by a vampire, she asks Hyun-joo to suck her blood. Choosing the inside of her thigh, Hyun-joo begins to feed on her friend.
Production.
Kim Jee-woon wrote and directed "Coming Out" as part of a project to distribute three digital short films online. Commissioned by venture group Media 4M, the project also included shorts by Jang Jin and Ryoo Seung-wan. "Coming Out" was shot with a Canon XL-1 camcorder during a time when digital filmmaking in South Korea was still in its infancy, and went on to inspire many other digital productions.
Release and critical response.
"Coming Out" was first broadcast online on 7 August 2000. In 2001 it was shown at the Fantasia Festival, and a report for "Ain't It Cool News" described the film as a "sexy and funny little short" with "a series of truly hilarious and unnerving scenes", also noting the "unmistakable overtones to the imagery" with regard to the final scene where Hyun-joo draws blood from her friend's thigh. Other festival screenings include the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival in 2001, and the Thessaloniki International Film Festival in 2005. "Coming Out" was also included as a special feature on the UK DVD release of "The Quiet Family", and a review at "DVDActive" praised it as "delicate, cerebral and contemporary cinema at its most profound."

<doc id="20034995" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20034995" title="Paradox in Oz">
Paradox in Oz

Paradox in Oz is a 1999 novel written by Edward Einhorn. As its title indicates, the book is an entry in the series of books about the Land of Oz written by L. Frank Baum and a host of successors.
The book.
"Paradox in Oz" was published by Hungry Tiger Press, with illustrations by Eric Shanower. It was playwright Einhorn's first novel and first Oz book. (His second in both categories, "The Living House of Oz", would appear in 2005.) The publication of "Paradox in Oz" was timed to coincide with the centennial of the original Oz book, "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" (as was also true of Gina Wickwar's "The Hidden Prince of Oz" and Dave Hardenbrook's "The Unknown Witches of Oz"). Einhorn's novel was warmly received and widely praised upon its initial publication, as were Shanower's illustrations; a review in "Asimov's Science Fiction" called it a "gorgeous book."
Genre.
In "Paradox in Oz" Einhorn maintains a fidelity to the benign utopian fantasy of Baum's Oz novels, though he also acknowledges the darker revisionist vein explored in contemporary books like Geoff Ryman's "Was" and Gregory Maguire's "" trilogy. Einhorn constructs an alternate, dystopian version of Oz, an Obsidian City in contrast to Baum's Emerald City.
Einhorn's book is also notable for its use of science fiction elements, principally time travel. There is a science fiction thread that winds through Baum's work, manifested in non-Oz books like "The Master Key" but also in the Oz stories, with robots ("Tik-Tok of Oz"), domed cities ("Glinda of Oz"), and other features. Critics have remarked on the interest in and acceptance of technology that sets Baum's Oz apart from earlier fantasy domains.
Synopsis.
As the novel opens, inhabitants of Oz are suddenly noticing unusual signs of aging. Omby Amby finds a white hair in his luxurious green beard, and common citizens confront wrinkles and back problems. Ozma and her advisers realize that the magic anti-aging spell, which has prevailed in Oz throughout her reign, has now stopped working. In their attempt to figure out why, Ozma and Glinda consult the Great Book of Records, but find cryptic references to the "Man Who Lives Backwards." (This person is actually living in Glinda's palace at the moment; but since he lives backwards, he is a baby in the present time, and cannot explain himself to them.)
In trying to puzzle out the problem, Ozma and Glinda confront a Parrot-Ox — a large magic creature, half parrot and half ox. "Its front half was covered with red, blue, and green plumage, and out from among its feathers proudly emerged a bright yellow beak. Two large, orange wings rested against its body, which was a speckled brown, and it had a long black tail with a feathered end. It stood upon four hooved feet, and its dark eyes darted nervously around the room, dismayed at being discovered." They learn that these creatures, normally invisible, are amazingly common; they co-exist with us in our everyday lives. A Parrot-Ox is "capable of doing nothing at all, unless it is impossible."
This particular Parrot-Ox calls himself Tempus. To resolve the mystery of the aging of Oz, Ozma rides Tempus back in time, to meet her predecessor King Oz in the forest surrounding the Forbidden Fountain. She encounters a curious person called Dr. Majestico, and she accidentally changes the past so that Oz becomes an evil place, ruled by a tyrannical Wizard from an Obsidian City, a negative-image of her own Emerald City. She must deal with altered versions of her familiar friends: the beautiful Glinda is old and worn, while the Tin Woodman is a human and very malevolent headsman, Nick Chopper.
In her efforts to remedy the situation, Ozma takes more and more trips into the past; the woods around the Forbidden Fountain are soon filled with Ozmas from different times. Ozma must confront Tip, her own earlier male self, and take a journey to Absurd City to find the Man Who Lives Backwards; she must face mind-boggling confusions, and numerous Parrot-Oxes, before she can restore the familiar world she knows and loves.
Ozian allusions.
Fans of Oz will find subtle allusions in Einhorn's text. In Chapter Six, for example, Tempus tells Ozma that he remembers things that "never happened," such as "when East used to be West and West used to be East..." This is a reference to a major and well-known contradiction in the Oz literature. In the second chapter of the original Oz book, "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz", Baum specifically places the Munchkin Country in the eastern section of Oz; Dorothy's house famously kills the Wicked Witch of the East when it lands on her there. Yet in later books, "Tik-Tok of Oz" and "The Lost Princess of Oz", maps show the Munchkin Country in the west.
In Obsidian City, the alternative version of Omby Amby calls himself Wantowin Battles — a name introduced by Ruth Plumly Thompson in her "Ozoplaning with the Wizard of Oz" (1939).
When dealing with Dorothy, the Evil Version of the Wizard makes a reference to the 1939 movie version, by reversing part of the Wizard's dialog, describing himself, as "a very bad man, but I am a very good wizard," before performing a wicked spell on the girl.
The illustrations.
Eric Shanower's black-and-white illustrations for "Paradox in Oz" are faithful to the richly romantic style that Shanower has developed for Oz illustration, from "The Enchanted Apples of Oz" (1986) on. Yet for pertinent incidents in Einhorn's text, Shanower expands his style to include elements of pop art and op art, and allusions to the work of M. C. Escher.

Karl Andreas Geyer

Karl Andreas Geyer (30 November 1809 – 21 November 1853) was a German botanist who was a native of Dresden. 
As a teenager, Geyer worked as an apprentice-gardener in Zabeltitz, and in 1830 became an assistant at the botanical gardens in Dresden. From 1835 to 1844 he performed botanical studies on several expeditions within the United States. In 1838-40 he worked as a botanist in the Upper Midwest for geographer Joseph Nicollet (1786-1843), and in 1841-42 collected plants in Illinois, Missouri and the Iowa Territory for botanist Georg Engelmann (1809-1884).
Afterwards he joined explorer William Drummond Stewart (1795-1871) on an expedition through the present-day states of Nebraska and Wyoming. Eventually, Geyer parted company with Stewart, and performed extensive botanical research in what would later be known as the Oregon Territory. In 1845 he returned to Germany, where he purchased land in Meissen and started a nursery. During his later years, he was an editor of the horticultural journal "Die Cronik des Gartenwesens".
Geyer has a number of plant species named after him, including "Allium geyeri" (Geyer's onion) and "Euphorbia geyeri" (Geyer's spurge). His botanical collection of nearly 10,000 specimens was acquired by the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew.

Conorfone

Conorfone (INN; TR-5109), also known as conorphone and codorphone, as well as conorphone hydrochloride (USAN), is an opioid analgesic that was never marketed. It is an analogue of hydrocodone substituted with an 8-ethyl group and an "N"-cyclopropylmethyl group. It acts as a mixed agonist-antagonist at the μ-opioid receptor, and is slightly more potent than codeine in analgesic effects but associated with somewhat greater side effects.

Harris began the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season by recording the second triple double in school history.
Harris previously attended Redford High School in Detroit, Michigan, where he won the state's Mr. Basketball award as a senior. Harris is one of only five Big Ten Conference basketball players to have finished in the top ten in the conference in scoring, rebounding, and assist average in the same season and prior to Evan Turner's 2009-10 season, Harris' 2008-09 season was the only time a player had finished in the top six of all three categories.
High school.
Born in Detroit, Michigan, Harris was a 2005 Class A All-State fifth team selection as a sophomore by "The Detroit News". He was an "Associated Press" Class A All-State first team selection in each of the next two seasons. Harris was selected as the 2007 Mr. Basketball of Michigan. That season he led the Redford to the Michigan High School Athletic Association Class A championship game, which it lost to Saginaw High School. During his high school basketball career, he became the first player to start for three consecutive Detroit Public School League championship teams since Jalen Rose and Voshon Lenard had done so from 1989 to 1991. At Redford, Harris once recorded 52 points and 15 rebounds. During the 2006–07 season, his last at Redford, Harris averaged 33.5 points, 11.5 rebounds and 5.5 assists. Harris was highly recruited, receiving offers from Tennessee, UCLA, Wisconsin, George Washington, and Indiana before committing to the University of Michigan. He was ranked by Rivals.com as the sixth-best shooting guard in the country in the 2007 high school class, while Scout.com ranked him the twelfth-best shooting guard. ESPN ranked him #7, but they listed him as a point guard. When Michigan announced that it would replace Tommy Amaker with John Beilein as head coach, Harris was initially unsure if he would honor his signed letter of intent, but when Michigan re-signed assistant coach Mike Jackson, he again decided to attend the school.
College.
Freshman year.
Prior to the 2007–08 basketball season, he was selected as a second team pre-season All-Big Ten Conference selection. After the 2007–08 NCAA basketball season, Harris was selected as a second team All-Big Ten Conference selection and an All-Freshman team selection. He led the Wolverines in scoring (16.4), assists (2.8), steals (1.5), minutes (32.9) and free throw percentage (82.0). Among his highlights during the season were being named to the Great Alaska Shootout tournament team, becoming the fourth U-M freshman to score over 500 points in first season (516), and setting the U-M freshman record for free throws made in a season while playing at least 20 minutes and starting every game. During the season, he keyed the first three game winning streak of the season for the team, which earned him his first Big Ten Player of the Week Award.
Sophomore year.
As a 2008–09 first team pre-season All-Big Ten player, he was the first Wolverine to earn the honor since Daniel Horton in 2004. Although he was the leading returning scorer and top draft prospect, Purdue's Robbie Hummel was named Big Ten Preseason Player of the Year. Preseason All-Big Ten status has not always led to regular season honors. In both 2005 and 2007, only two preseason selections made the regular season team. Harris opened the 2008–09 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball season with a career-high 30 points in a 77–55 victory over Michigan Tech on November 11. The following night in the second game of the Coaches vs. cancer classic, Harris nearly posted a triple double when he posted 26 points, and career-highs with 10 rebounds and 8 assists in a 76–56 win against Northeastern University. This quick start earned Harris the November 17, 2008 Big Ten Player of the Week Award. Harris led the Big Ten Conference in scoring until the second to last game of the preconference schedule when he snapped a ten-game double digit scoring streak. Throughout the season, he continued to battle with fellow sophomores Evan Turner and Talor Battle for the Big Ten scoring leadership. On February 5, Harris was selected along with Kalin Lucas as one of only two Big Ten John R. Wooden Award 2008–09 Midseason Top 30 Candidates. On March 5, the National Association of Basketball Coaches honored Harris as a District 7 (Big Ten) first-team selection along with four other sophomores (Lucas, Turner, Battle, and JaJuan Johnson). On March 9 after the conclusion of the 2008–09 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, he was named to the first team All-Big Ten by both the Big Ten coaches and the Big Ten media along with the same four sophomores. He was also chosen on March 10 by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association for its 2008–09 Men's Division I District V (OH, IN, IL, MI, MN, WI) Team, based on voting from its national membership. On March 26 Harris was honored as one of four Michigan men's basketball Winter Sports Big Ten Academic All-Conference selections.
Iowa Hawkeyes freshman Matt Gatens completed the 2008–2009 season with 75/83 90.4% Free Throw shooting percentage in 32 games. However, a common threshold for eligibility for such a statistical championship is 2.5 free throws made per game and 75% of team games played, leaving him five free throws short of eligibility. Thus, Harris, at 86.3% (176/204), was the Big Ten leader among those with a qualifying number of attempts according to some sources. However, the Big Ten Conference recognizes only two Free Throws made per game as the threshold. Nonetheless, the NCAA recognizes a 2.5 attempts per game minimum. Thus, according to the Big Ten Gatens is the Conference Free Throw Champion and according the NCAA Harris is the champion. Harris led the Wolverines in points, minutes, assists and steals. Additionally, Harris finished one behind teammate DeShawn Sims for the team leadership rebounds. In the Big Ten, Harris ranked first (or second depending on the source) in free throw percentage, first in free throws made, second in points per game, fifth in assists per game, and sixth in rebounds per game. Harris and Evan Turner (who led the Big Ten in scoring) were the only Big Ten players to finish in the conference's top 10 in total points, rebounds, assists, and steals. They are the 4th and 5th players in conference history to finish in the top ten in average points, rebounds, and assists since assists became a statistic in 1983–84, following Steve Smith, Jim Jackson, and Brian Evans. Of these five, Harris was the only one to finish in the top six in each stat prior to Turner's 2009-10 season.
Junior year.
Entering the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season for the 2009–10 Michigan Wolverines, Harris was regarded by some as the most highly rated player in the Big Ten. E.g., the FOX Sports preseason All-American list included him on its second team. No other Big Ten player was listed above the third team. However, ESPN chose both Lucas and Turner to its preseason second-team All-American list, while Harris was not shown on a single ballot. Harris and Sims were named among the 50 preseason Wooden Award watch list nominees. Harris was also named to the preaseason Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist. The 24-member Big Ten media panel selected Harris as a first team preseason All-Big Ten team member.
Harris opened the season by recording the second triple double in school history (Gary Grant was the first) against Division II Northern Michigan. This earned him his third Big Ten player of the week honor and marked the second consecutive season he earned the honor in the first week of the year. Harris was suspended prior to the January 23 game against #13 Purdue due to unsportsmanlike conduct in one of the team's practices. Harris was named as a finalist for the 2010 Bob Cousy Award and a Midseason Top-30 finalist for the 2010 John Wooden Award. At the conclusion of the regular season, he was named a third-team All-Big Ten selection by both the conference coaches and the media. He was recognized as an All-District second-team selection by the National Association of Basketball Coaches making him eligible for the State Farm Division I All‐America teams. Since the Big Ten Conference was its own district, this is equivalent to being named second team All-Big Ten by the NABC. Harris concluded his junior season with 484 free throws made. Cazzie Russell holds the official Michigan career record with 486 with Louis Bullock's 505 total having been vacated due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal. He joined Jalen Rose and Mike McGee as the only Wolverines to amass 1600 points over a three-year period. Harris finished the season among the Big Ten Conference leaders in several statistical categories including: fourth in scoring, tenth in rebounds, fifth in assists, seventh in free throw percentage, second in steals (1.83 to 1.81), and eighth in minutes played.
Harris told Coach John Beilein he would not be returning to the team for his senior season on March 26, 2010. He is soon to be hiring an agent. Although these were rumors reported by "The Detroit News", Harris held a press conference on March 29 to announce his intentions to enter the NBA Draft. ESPN has him ranked at 76. Draft Express, projects him as the 25th pick of the 2nd round. Another source has him listed as the 22nd pick of the 2nd round. Two days after the announcement, Harris was recognized as an Academic All-Conference performer again. Harris' name remained on the draft eligible list after the May 8 deadline for withdrawal. Harris endured a hamstring injury shortly before the draft, which hampered his draft workouts and draft potential. Harris was undrafted in the 2010 NBA draft on June 24, 2010.
Professional career.
2010–2011.
Harris played for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Summer League in 2010. He saw limited action due to the same ankle injury that impaired his draft status. After being an undrafted player from Michigan for about 3 months, Harris joined the Cleveland Cavaliers with a #6 jersey number as a non-guaranteed free agent member of the 20-man preseason roster. The Cavaliers reduced their roster to 15 by October 19 without cutting Harris, which means that Harris made the final roster. On opening night of the 2010–11 NBA season for the Cavaliers, Harris was on the active twelve-man roster, but was not one of the nine players to see action in the October 27 game versus the Boston Celtics. However, in the subsequent October 29 game against the Toronto Raptors, Harris debuted with an eight-point performance that included two-for-two three point shooting. According to ESPN data, Harris' rookie salary is $473,604, which is the lowest on the roster. Harris' agent is Henry Thomas. Harris has been deep on the 15-man roster and in some games has not been one of the members of the 12-man active roster to dress for games. However, after compiling a 7–14 record in the first 21 games, head coach Byron Scott shuffled the lineup on December 8, and Harris played twenty-one minutes that night. In subsequent games, he saw significant action.
On December 29, Harris made his first start when Mo Williams was recovering from an injury and Harris earned the surprise start instead of Ramon Sessions. Harris started again on New Years Day 2011 alongside Sessions and posted his first double digit scoring night with eleven points and his first three-assist night. In his fourth start on January 7 against the Golden State, Harris posted his first double-double with career highs of 16 points and 10 rebounds and added 3 steals and 4 assists, too. Then, on January 9, he posted a new career-high 27 points against the Phoenix Suns. He finished January by scoring 20 points on back-to-back nights against the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat on January 30 and 31. He scored 19 in his next game against Indiana on February 2, but then with the return of Daniel Gibson and Anthony Parker to the lineup he saw little action until Gibson was unavailable against Houston on February 23 and Harris scored 21.
2011–2012.
Harris was waived by the Cavaliers on December 22, 2011. The transaction came as the 2011–12 Cavaliers made their final cuts from 17 to 15 players. The move, which surprisingly left Mychel Thompson on the roster, was attributed to a freezer burn that Harris suffered on his foot during the 2011 NBA lockout in a cooling chamber designed to augment recuperation from injuries at the Nike facility in Oregon. Harris had been unable to practice with the team, but was expected to be claimed by another team. After clearing waivers on December 24, Harris became an unrestricted free agent.
On December 28, 2011, Harris signed with the Canton Charge of the NBA Development League (D-League). The Charge are the D-League affiliate of the Cavaliers, but the Cavaliers have no exclusive rights to Harris. He was signed under the NBA Development League's player affiliate rule allowing ". . .D-League teams to acquire up to three players that were waived from their affiliate's NBA training camp that do not otherwise have their rights held by another team." After about a week of rehab with the Charge, he was getting close to returning to the court with the Charge. Technically, he was waived by the team, but the Charge retained their rights to him during his rehab. On January 9, he was readded to the roster by the Charge, and he scored 15 points for the team on the 10th in his debut.
On January 18 against the Austin Toros, he posted a game-high 24 points. He entered the starting lineup on January 20 against the Texas Legends and posted a team-high 17 points and added a game-high 19 points and 9 rebounds in a rematch the following night. On January 24, he contributed a game-high 32-point effort against the Springfield Armor, surpassing both his professional career-high of 27 set on January 9, 2011 with Cleveland and his post-secondary career-high 30 set on November 11, 2008 with Michigan. On January 27, he had his first D-league double-double with 22 points and 10 rebounds, in addition to a team-high 7 assists against the Bakersfield Jam. He continued his scoring binge on January 28 against the Los Angeles D-Fenders with a team-high 21 points. He earned the NBA Development League Performer of the Week for games played from January 23–29 for his three-game performance in which he averaged 25.0 points, 7.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 2.0 steals in 34.3 minutes per contest. On February 3, Harris logged his professional career-high 14 rebounds along with 21 points on his way to his second D-League double-double against the Austin Toros. Harris posted his third double-double on February 11 against the Sioux Falls Skyforce with 24 points and 13 rebounds. On February 16, Harris posted a new career high 46 points along with 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 4 steals against the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. This is a Charge record for the franchise since its move to Canton. In the rematch two nights later, he added 36 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 steals. He became the first player to earn two player of the week awards in the 2011–12 season when the league recognized him for his performance for the week of February 13–19. In 17 games for Canton, he had averages of 21.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.6 blocks per game, while shooting 47.0% from the field and 40.9% on three-point shots. On February 21, the Cleveland Cavaliers announced they had signed Harris to a 10-day contract. He was re-signed on March 2 to a second 10-day contract. After the second 10-day contract expired on March 11 and with the trade deadline approaching on March 15, the Cavaliers opted not to sign Harris to a guaranteed contract for the rest of the season (which would be required to resign him after two 10-day contracts). Rather than report to the D-League Canton Charge, Harris opted to remain a free agent while teams made roster moves.
On March 17, 2012, the Cavaliers re-signed Harris for the remainder of the season. On March 21, Harris moved into the main rotation and began playing about 20 minutes or more per game. On March 25, against the Phoenix Suns, Harris posted a game-high 9 rebounds. On April 6 with Parker, Kyrie Irving and Gibson all injured, Harris made his first start of the season and 16th of his career against the Toronto Raptors. On April 20, Harris posted his first NBA double-double of the season with 19 points and a game-high and career-high 12 rebounds against the New York Knicks. In two seasons with the Cavaleiers, Harris averaged 6.2 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 17.4 minutes in 80 games (including 20 starts).
2012–2013.
On July 2, 2012, the Cavaliers waived Harris. Harris then joined the Houston Rockets for the 2012 NBA Summer League. On September 13, 2012, Harris signed with BC Azovmash in Ukraine.
2013–2014.
On September 27, 2013, Harris signed with the Orlando Magic for training camp. NBA.com's John Denton evaluated Harris as a long shot to make the 15-man roster saying that "he will likely have to beat out E'Twaun Moore or Doron Lamb at shooting guard". Meanwhile the "Bleacher Report" Justin Hussong listed Harris 4th on the pre-training camp shooting guard depth chart behind Arron Afflalo, Victor Oladipo, and Lamb. He was later waived on October 25. On December 7, Harris' rights were acquired by Los Angeles D-Fenders in a trade with the Canton Charge. In his D-Fenders debut on December 14, 2013 against the Santa Cruz Warriors, he scored 41 points. He also had a professional career-high 5 steals, 4 rebounds and 3 assists. The next night, Harris scored 24 points along with 4 rebounds and 3 assists. On December 16, he was one of the top D-League players of the week. On December 23, he was again one of the top D-league players of the week, based on a pair of 20+-point performances. He was also a finalist for D-League Player of the Month. Harris averaged 29.3 points per game for the week ending January 5, leading his team in scoring and to victory in each of the three games. As a result, he earned his first D-League player of the week award of the season and third of his career. On January 10, Harris posted 49 points along with 6 rebounds, 3 steals, 3 assists and a block against the Idaho Stampede. The 49 points was a Los Angeles D-Fenders franchise record (surpassing the old 43-point record) and tied the 2013-14 NBADL season high set earlier by Pierre Jackson. The record was eclipsed exactly three weeks later by Terrence Williams, who scored 50 for the D-Fenders against the same team. On January 11, against the Stampede, Harris posted 38 points and 10 rebounds, but the D-Fenders' six-game winning streak was snapped. On January 13, Harris earned his second consecutive NBA Development League Performer of the Week award. On January 13, Harris scored 42 against the Maine Red Claws to improve his season scoring average to 30.6, taking the league lead from Jackson. In 13 games with the D-Fenders, Harris averaged a league-leading 30.6 points, league-leading 8.9 free throws made and a league-leading 10.2 free throws attempted. He also averaged 6.5 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 2.1 steals (6th in the league), while shooting 48.5%.
On January 16, 2014, Harris signed a 10-day contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. In his debut with the Lakers the next day, he had 7 points, 3 rebounds and an assist in a 107-104 win over the Boston Celtics. On January 26, he signed a second 10-day contract after averaging 6.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 20.9 minutes in 5 games. The Lakers were enduring injuries of guards Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Steve Blake, Jordan Farmar, and Xavier Henry. After re-signing, Harris posted a season high 18 points that night against the New York Knicks.
On February 3, 2014, Harris was named to the Futures All-Star roster for the 2014 NBA D-League All-Star Game. At the time of the announcement, Harris was one of at five players on an NBA roster (along with Malcolm Thomas, Isaiah Canaan, Robert Covington, and Chris Johnson) that were selected, but who had played over half of their D-League team's games through January 26, which is the D-League All-Star eligibility requirement. He must be on a D-League team roster as of February 15 to play in the game. On February 4, the eve of the end of Harris' second 10-day contract, the Lakers appeared to be returning to good health, with the return of Nash, Blake and Farmar to the lineup imminent. That night, although Nash and Blake returned to the starting lineup against Minnesota, Jodie Meeks and Jordan Hill were injured in the first quarter and Harris contributed 19 points and 8 rebounds even though he had been told before the game he would not be re-signed. On February 7, 2014, he was re-acquired by the D-Fenders. On February 8, 2014, Harris again set a new D-Fenders franchise scoring record, this time with 56 points, while adding 15 rebounds against the Santa Cruz Warriors. It was two points shy of the league record set by Jackson four days earlier. He was a nominee for D-League Player of the Week, but Jackson won. Harris only played 12 minutes in the February 15 D-League All-Star game. Afterwards, he missed some games due to an ankle injury. He returned to the lineup ont February 24. He was a finalist for player of the week on March 3.
Personal.
His name, Corperryale, is a combination of the names of his cousin (Corrine), an uncle (Perry) and the "ale" of his immediate siblings—Janelle, Jerrelle and Al. He has a total of nine brothers and sisters and is the son of Merrick (Harris-Carter) and James Carter. His nickname, "Manny", was given to him by his father after the character Manny Ribera in "Scarface". During the 2013-14 season, the @DFenders and @nbadleague Twitter accounts occasionally referred to Harris using the hashtag #MichiganMamba. Upon being called up to the NBA, @LakerNation used the nickname once.

Stokes Inlet

Stokes Inlet is an inlet in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia.
The inlet is situated from Esperance in Stokes National Park and is set is a large river valley with permanent deep water and high dunes located on either side. Thick bushland and paperbark trees surround the inlet and grow down to the waters edge. It is in a largely unmodified condition.
The inlet functions primarily as a result of wave energy and is a wave dominated estuary.
Geography.
The inlet is managed by the Department of Environment and Conservation with a catchment that extends over inland and is fed by two main rivers: The Young and Lort River.
The inlet itself is long and wide with an area of and receives an annual flow of 5 million cubic metres.
The central basin has an area of with intertidal flats having an area of approximately .
The mouth of the river is in the middle of Dunster Castle Bay, it is closed by a sandbar that cuts the estuary off from the sea and only opens every few years. As a result the salinity and water level fluctuate greatly dependent upon the amount of evaporation and river flow.
Flora.
The aquatic flora of the estuary are dominated by the small green algae "Polyphysa peniculus" the stonewort "Lamprothamnium papulosum" and the seagrass "Ruppia megacarpa".
The waterbody of the inlet is fringed with Salt Water Paperbarks with sedges and samphire common along the sandy sections.
Fauna.
Marine species flourish at times when the bar is open such blue manna crabs, juvenile prawns, cockles and mussels have all been identified in the inlet. 
Many fish species inhabit the estuary such as the common minnow, hardyheads, gobies and larger species such as Black Bream and Sea Mullet.

<doc id="20035326" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20035326" title="Mount Binuluan">
Mount Binuluan

Mount Binuluan (also known as Ambalatungan) is a remote volcano in the Kalinga province of the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) Region of the Philippines. The high mountain is part of the Cordillera Central mountain range on Luzon island, the largest island in the country. Binuluan exhibits active volcanism through numerous fumarole fields, solfataras and hot springs on its slope. There were reports of possible eruptions in 1952 and 1986 (or 1987), but they are unverified.
Geography.
Mount Binuluan (Lubuaganyen dialect) is one of the highest peaks in the area. The mountain is surrounded by the municipalities of Lubuagan, Pasil and Tinglayan in Kalinga province. 
Southeast of the mountain is the Chico River flowing from southwest to northeast direction, while due northwest of the mountain is Pasil River, also flowing from southwest to northeast direction merging with Chico River just past the mountain. Mount Binuluan belongs to a range of mountains situated between the two rivers, trending southwest to northeast. Just southwest of Binuluan is Mount Mosimus , followed by Mount Cauitan and Mount Alchan (Alchanon) , the 19th and 20th tallest mountain in the Philippines. South of this line of mountains are Mount Chumangil and Mount Patoc , the other volcano of the Central Cordillera Range displaying strong fumarolic activity.
Geology.
The Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program list Binuluan under Ambalatungan Group. The dacitic little-known cluster of volcanoes Ambalatungan by Alvir (1956) and the Philippine Commission of Volcanology (1981), and as Mount Binuluan by Wolfe (1982) was described as consisting of three volcanoes constructed along a roughly E-W line. Binuluan volcano contains a steep-walled crater with hot springs and vigorous sulfur-encrusted fumarolic vents that produce loud noises. Bumabag volcano, east of Binuluan, has two craters that also show strong fumarolic activity. Podakan volcano, SE of Bumabag, also has a large steam vent. The Bumabag and Podakan volcanoes could possibly be flank vents of Mount Binuluan.
The Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) lists Binuluan or Ambalatungan as an inactive volcano.
Other studies.
Mount Binuluan is usually covered in cloud or mist and so photographs could be difficult to obtain. The village of Bangtitan in Upper Uma in Lubuagan is a good vantage point for views and photography of the mountain on the rare occasions when the primary peak is not mist-enshrouded. It is not known if Binuluan itself has ever been climbed as access to the site is very difficult. The terrain is rugged and undeveloped.
There has been some geological surveying related to the Batong Buhay gold mining activities in Pasil, but the locals say no one has ever climbed or surveyed Binuluan because it is "too far away", "there's no reason to go there", "it is too difficult climbing that", and "even the geologists didn't bother".
Groundwork in 2007 and 2008 as part of a comprehensive systematic survey, shows volcanic-related activities around Binuluan, from northwestward of the peak, going counterclockwise, to eastward side of the peak.
Further groundwork was abandoned due to tribal conflcits on the southwest flank (Tinglayan-Tulgao tribal conflict), and unrelated inter-tribal conflicts on the northwest and northeast flanks (Upper Uma-Lubuagan conflict).
In 2008, the Department of Energy approved two local firms, Aragorn Power and Energy Corp. (APEC) and Guidance Management Corp. (GMC) to jointly explore area in the municipalities of Pasil, Tinglayan, and Lubuagan for geothermal energy feasibility studies.
Geothermal features.
Mount Binuluan exhibits a number of active geothermal features. There are a number of sites with strong steam emission, fumarolic activity, surface sulfur deposits, hot fresh water springs, hot sulfurous water springs, sulfur staining of riverine rocks, poisonous gas emissions, recent volcanic gas related deaths (>100 in last 20 years at Batong Buhay mines alone), heat destruction of vegetation, poisonous water, fumarole fields with new and shifting activity. 
Bu-ot Fumarole Field.
The Bu-ot Fumarole Field (Balatoc dialect) is located on Balatoc tribal land, along the Pasil River on the steep western valley slope, with the path going up to Balatoc village immediately to the right of the fumarole field.
The steep area is located at approximately at an elevation of about above sea level. There are two active steam vents with yellow sulfuric water flowing out, as well as from some other locations in the field, down to the Pasil River. The rocks along the Pasil River are heavily stained orange-yellow both upstream and downstream from the Bu-ot fumarole field.
Bum-bag Fumarole Fields.
Bum-bag fumarole fields Boom-bag (Balatoc dialect), (or Djum-ag in Upper Uma dialect), are located approximately east of Bu-ot, on Batong Buhay tribal land in Pasil. The fields are on the eastern side of the Pasil River valley at an elevation of about above sea level. One walks through the Bum-bag rice terraces located at an elevation of about , to get to the fumarole fields. The fields though are located in a private property. The owner of the property reported that the underground rattling, banging, and explosions stopped years ago, but he could not be any more specific as to time, and was not specific about which particular field. Bum-bag fumarole fields appear to be consistent with the GVP's 'Bumabag Volcano', but it is located west of the summit, not east.
There were broad swathes of bare ground between the numbered fields where all vegetation was absent except broken scorched trunks of mature pine tree. Besides the four fields, there could be another field over the ridge to the north of field 1, but it is unexplored. 
Sugo-oc fumarole field.
The Sugo-oc fumarole field could be seen and photographed from the southern side of Binuluan in Bunog River valley, along the Tinglayan-Tulgao road. Unfortunately mist, cloud, and intermittent rain could easily prevent all photography. The fumarole field can be accessed through Dananao, Tulgao or Sumadel in Tinglayan.
Hot Springs.
Numerous hot springs, both fresh water, and sulfurous water, exist in a wide half ring around the south and western sides of Binuluan. Bu-ot fumarole field, Bum-bag fumarole fields, and Sugu-oc fumarole field, all have hot sulfurous water springs. Along the Pasil River upstream from Bu-ot, six hot sulfurous water springs and one fumarole are said to be located.
Sun-ut hot spring.
Downstream from Bu-ot on the Sun-ut River below the village of Ag-agama, is the Sun-ut hot sulfur water spring. The local priest in Ag-agama says there used to be a natural bowl on the banks of the Sun-ut River into which the spring flowed and in which the people of Ag-agama bathed daily. But a typhoon-induced flooding of the Sun-ut river washed away the bowl and now the spring flows directly into the river. The spring is located on private property, the owner, living in Ag-agama. Further information from locals may disclose the other hot water springs in tributaries off the Pasil River upstream from Bu-ot.
Bunog Falls and hot springs.
Along the Bunog River, downstream from Bunog Falls below Tulgao West, are numerous hot sulfurous springs. The first spring is visible from Bunog Falls, about downstream from the Bunog Falls' hot freshwater springs. According to Tulgao and Tinglayan locals, there was a hot salt water spring on the Bunog River which used to be harvested and the water 'cooked' (evaporated) to produce salt, before the Cordillera Highway was first blazed. Also, according to them, one of the springs is poisonous killing animals and birds which drink from it. There are no paths along the Bunog River to get to the other springs.
Locals in Tinglayan and Lubuagan do not know any other hot sulfur water springs in the Chico River or its tributaries other than Bunog River.
Possible eruptions.
A possible phreatic or steam eruption was reported from Mount Binuluan in 1952, during which a sulfur-rich debris flow killed a dozen people. Details about the eruption in 1952 are still scant. In 2007 and 2008, some 90 and 100-year old elders in Brgy. Tulgao in Tinglayan said the loss of life in 1952 was caused by an eruption during a typhoon followed with the collapse of a natural earth bank below Sugo-oc fumarole field, high on the northern side of the Bunog River. The consequent mudslide buried a few houses below near the villages of Dananao and Sumadel, Tinglayan, killing maybe 12 people or thereabouts.
In 2007 and 2008, people in southern Kalinga around Binuluan spoke of an 'eruption' at Sugo-oc in 1986 or 1987. During the Abra earthquake at 20:16 hours on Sunday, January 13, 2008, buildings in Tinglayan shook and windows rattled for about 10 seconds. When speaking in English, the locals there at the time called this an 'eruption'. Gentle questioning of locals over months led to the conclusion that there are difficulties in communicating the difference between an eruption and an earthquake. 
There were reports about that earthquake of 1986, which was felt also felt throughout the municipality of Lubuagan, was simultaneous with an eruption at Sugo-oc resulting in the ejection of ash and rock. Three people in Dananao village were killed by the ejected rocks. Because of these, there was a large migration out of the village with the Dananao people taking possession of a land along the Tubuk-to-Aurora Road in eastern Kalinga and resettling there.
Accessibility.
From Manila to Bontoc or Tabuk.
Visiting the thermal features of Mount Binuluan, the visitor has to travel to Bontoc, the capital of Mountain Province, or to Tabuk, the capital of Kalinga province to Pasil or Tinglayan in Kalinga. From Manila one can travel to Tabuk, by car or coach, a journey of about 10 hours at night or longer by day. From Manila to Bontoc by bus or 4-wheel drive vehicle takes about 10 hours at night. 
From Tabuk to Tinglayan (SE slope).
From Tabuk, there are minibuses for Bontoc via Lubuagan or Tinglayan that depart at 8:00 a.m. for first trip. The road is rough but scenery is quite spectacular. Passengers can sit on the roof for a bit of rough adventure, but offering the best view.
From Bontoc to Tinglayan (SE slope).
From Bontoc, a minibus leaves for Tabuk at about 8:00 a.m., and jeepneys also leave in the morning. Traveling this way from the south, after about 4 hours exit the bus at Tinglayan in the Chico River Valley. 
A reliable local guide from Tinglayan (where reasonable accommodation is available) can take you to either Tulgao or Sumadel by foot - about 3 hours hike. Most of the year there is rain or mist along these paths and appropriate warm waterproof clothing is necessary. Along the Bunog River from Tulgao to Tinglayan are a number of hot clean water springs. 
In Tulgao or Sumadel, you need to negotiate to find a local guide willing to take you to the Sugo-oc fumarole field. The trek from the village to the fumarole field is steep, difficult, at higher elevation, along carabao (water buffalo) tracks. As of 2008, tourists do not visit Sugo-oc and special arrangements need to be made. There is no western style accommodation in the villages of Tulgao or Sumadel, and no accommodation at all at Sugo-oc. There is a little used foot track from Sumadel to the plateau on the southern flank of Binuluan but requires some months of planning and negotiation and a high level of fitness.
From Tabuk to Pasil River Valley (NW slope).
From Tabuk, the capital of Kalinga province, one jeepney leaves about 7:00 a.m. for Batong Buhay in the Pasil River Valley. If there is sufficient demand a second jeepney may leave about 8:00 a.m.. Traveling this way from the north is about 5 hours. Four-wheel drive and high clearance is required for any private vehicle. There are no signposts and local knowledge is needed. There is no western style accommodation anywhere in the Pasil River Valley (2008). 
Alight at Ag-agama drop-off to see the Sun-ut hot sulfur water spring. Alight at Balatoc drop-off and walk towards the village of Balatoc to see the Bu-ot fumarole field along the way, and the orange-yellow stained rocks of the Pasil River. At Balatoc, you might be able to arrange a local guide to take you to Bum-bag fumarole firld. Most of the walk is on tribal lands or private property. Walk from Balatoc to Bum-bag is only for the fit and takes about 5 hours one way. There are no accommodations near Bum-bag fumarole field although there are some very basic huts at the Bum-bag rice terraces. Bum-bag fields are located on private property and permission is required from the owner. 
Peace and order.
Kalinga is a tribal area and is often subjected to inter-tribal conflict which can quickly escalate to armed warfare with deaths. Most tribes have peace pacts with other tribes, but some tribes refuse to enter into the peace pact system. Tribal law (customary law) is recognized by the Republic Government and takes precedence over republic law. A person who trespasses, damages property, hurts another person, or kills another person, is likely to be dealt with under tribal law.
Foreigners and lowlanders are not covered by the peace pact process and need to be extremely careful if entering any of the lands around Binuluan. Local guides/guards are needed at all times. Visitors should inquire about the latest peace and order situation in the Kalingas before proceeding to the area.

Carbureted compression ignition model engine

A Carbureted compression ignition model engine, popularly known as a Model diesel engine, is a simple compression ignition engine made for model propulsion, usually model aircraft but also model boats. These are quite similar to the typical glow-plug engine that runs on a mixture of methanol-based fuels with a hot wire filament to provide ignition. Despite their name, their use of compression ignition, and the use of a kerosene fuel that is similar to diesel, model diesels share very little with full-size diesel engines.
Comparison with full-size engines.
Full-size diesel engines, such as those found in a truck, are fuel injected and either two-stroke or four-stroke. They use compression ignition to ignite the mixture: the compression within the cylinder heats the inlet charge sufficiently to cause ignition, without requiring any external ignition source. A fundamental feature of such engines, unlike petrol (gasoline) engines, is that they draw in air alone and the fuel is only mixed by being injected into the combustion chamber separately. Model diesel engines are instead a carbureted two-stroke using the crankcase for charge-air compression. The carburetor supplies a "mixture" of fuel and air into the engine, with the proportions kept fairly constant and their total volume throttled to control the engine power. Apart from sharing the diesel's use of compression ignition, their construction has more in common with a small two-stroke motorcycle or lawnmower engine.
Variable compression.
Model diesels have variable compression ratios. This variable compression is achieved by a "contra-piston," at the top of the cylinder, which can be adjusted by a screwed "T-bar". The swept volume of the engine remains the same, but as the volume of the combustion chamber at top dead center is changed by adjusting the contra-piston, the compression ratio (swept volume + combustion chamber / combustion chamber) changes accordingly.
There also exist model diesels with fixed compression heads. A few examples are the British 5cc OWAT or the American DRONE.
These engines have a fixed compression ratio, but the compression can be altered slightly with the use of more or less lubrication oil in the fuel.
Also the engine's load has an impact on the compression and ignition timing.
Larger propellers give a longer combustion time and so higher compression.
Smaller propellers reduce the load, and therefore the compression pressure build up, which changes the ignition timing to earlier.
Advantages.
Model diesels are found to produce more torque than glow engines of the same displacement, and are thought to get better fuel efficiency, because the same power is produced at lower rpm, and in a smaller displacement engine. However, the specific power may not be significantly superior to a glow engine, due to the heavier construction needed to assure that the engine can withstand the much higher compression ratio, sometimes as high as 30:1. Diesels also run significantly quieter, due to the more rapid combustion, unlike glow engines, in which combustion may still be occurring when the exhaust ports are uncovered, causing a significant amount of noise.
Disadvantages.
Compared to glow plug engines, model diesels are more difficult to throttle over a wide range of powers, making them less suitable for radio-controlled models than either two or four stroke glow-plug engines although this difference is claimed to be less noticeable with the use of modern schnuerle-ported engines.
Fuel.
These "diesels" run on a mixture of kerosene, ether, castor oil or vegetable oil, and cetane or amyl nitrite booster. The fuel used contains Diethyl ether, which is highly volatile and has an extremely low flash point, combined with kerosene and a lubricant plus a very small proportion (typically 2%) of ignition improver such as Amyl nitrite or preferably Isopropyl nitrate nowadays.
Starting.
The engine is started by reducing the compression and setting the spray bar mixture rich with the adjustable needle valve, gradually increasing the compression while cranking the engine. The compression is increased until the engine starts running. The mixture can then be leaned out and the compression increased. Compared to glow plug engines, model diesel engines exhibit much higher fuel economy, thus increasing endurance for the amount of fuel carried. They also exhibit higher torque, enabling the turning of a larger or higher pitched propeller at slower speed. Since the combustion occurs well before the exhaust port is uncovered, these engines are also considerably quieter (when unmuffled) than glow-plug engines of similar displacement.

Business routes of Interstate 10

Interstate business routes are roads connecting a central or commercial district of a city or town with an Interstate bypass. These roads typically follow along local streets often along a former U.S. route or state highway that had been replaced by an Interstate. Interstate business routes are signed as either loops or spurs using a green shield shaped and numbered like the shield of the parent Interstate highway.
Some states regard Interstate business routes as fully integrated within their state highway system while other states consider them to be either local roads to be maintained by county or municipal authorities or a hybrid of state and local control.
Although the public generally differentiates between different business routes by the number of the parent route and the location of the route, there is no uniform naming convention. Each state highway department internally uses its own designations to identify segments within its jurisdiction.
Along Interstate 10, business routes are found in the four westernmost states through which I-10 passes: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and the far western region of Texas beyond the Pecos River. Although I-10 is a transcontinental highway, none of the states to the east along the Interstate have yet to designate I-10 business routes.
California.
Interstate business routes in California are designated by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), but are usually relinquished back to local jurisdiction for maintenance. Along Interstate 10, business routes are signed and maintained by municipal authorities where they do not overlay state highways, and are not officially a part of the state highway system. The business loop in Blythe is the only one that remains sufficiently well signed for navigation. Although the other former routes along I-10 may have some remnant shields remaining, these loops are not signed from I-10 nor sufficiently signed for motorists to be able to find their way along their routes.
Blythe business loop.
Interstate 10 Business is a Business loop of Interstate 10 at Blythe in Riverside County. The route begins at I-10 Exit 236 and goes to the north along Neighbours Blvd.. The route turns to the east along Hobson Way through town, then crosses underneath I-10 just before the Colorado River at the Arizona state line and emerges from the underpass as Riviera Dr. where the route reconnects with I-10 at Exit 243. The business loop has major intersections with U.S. Route 95 and State Route 78.
The route was originally designated as part of US 60 and US 70, except in Neighbours Boulevard.
Historic routes in California.
Ontario business loop began at Interstate 10 Exit 42B (eastbound) and followed SR 71 southeast to Holt Ave. in Pomona. The route followed Holt Ave. through Montclair and rejoined I-10 at Exit 55A in Ontario. The route was formerly designated as US 70 and US 99.
Colton business loop began at Interstate 10 Exit 59 in Ontario going north on Etiwanda Ave. and then east along Valley Blvd. through Fontana, Bloomington, and Rialto, and then rejoined I-10 at Exit 71 along Mt. Vernon Ave. in Colton. The route was formerly designated as US 60, US 70, and US 99.
Indio business loop began at Interstate 10 Exit 139 in Indio and followed Indio Blvd. southeast to Coachella. The route then turned northwest on Dillon Rd. intersecting SR 86 before returning to I-10 at Exit 146. Part of the route followed SR 111. The route was formerly designated as US 60, US 70, and US 99.
Arizona.
All of the business loops within Arizona are maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT). Interstate 10 has five business loops within the state, four of these in Cochise County alone. ADOT identifies Interstate business loops as State Business Routes followed by the number of the parent Interstate. Individual loops along an Interstate are designated by adding parenthetical numbers that increase eastward and northward. Gaps in numbering represent removal of former routes or potential expansion.
Quartzsite business loop.
State Business Route 10 (1) is a business loop of Interstate 10 at Quartzsite in La Paz County commissioned in 1984. The route, known locally as Quartzsite Blvd., Main St., and Riggles Ave. begins at Exit 17 of I-10 and U.S. Route 95 west of town and ends at Exit 24 of I-10 east of town. Between its termini, the route has major intersections with US 95 and State Route 95.
The route was originally designated as part of US 60 and US 70.
Benson business loop.

Arizona has a number of former business routes that have been decommissioned.
Phoenix business loop began at Interstate 17 at Exit 199B northbound and Exit 200B southbound and followed Van Buren St. through central Phoenix east to SR 143 (Hohokam Freeway). The route then followed SR 143 south to Interstate 10 Exit 153. This route was decommissioned in the 1980s.
Casa Grande business loop began at Interstate 10 Exit 185 and followed SR 387 (Pinal Ave.). In Casa Grande, the route turned east onto SR 287 (Florence Blvd.) to I-10 Exit 194.
Tucson business loop originally began at Interstate 10 Exit 255 in Tucson. The route went east along SR 77 (Miracle Mile), south along Oracle Rd., then east along Drachman St., and then south along Sixth Ave. to I-10 Exit 261. The portion of the route beginning along Oracle Rd. is the former route of US 80 and US 89. Shields marking this route were removed in the 1990s. A second business loop later followed the route of the former US 80 in eastern Tucson from I-10 Exit 262 along Park Ave. and Benson Hwy. to Valencia Rd. from which it rejoined I-10 at Exit 267.
Benson business spur began at Interstate 10 Exit 304 and ran northward along Ocotillo St. to the current Benson business loop.
New Mexico.
All of the business loops within New Mexico are maintained by the New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT). In New Mexico, Interstate business routes are named independently of their parent Interstate's designation with business loops of Interstate 25 numbered between 10–19, those of Interstate 10 between 20–29, and those of Interstate 40 between 30–39. New Mexico business loop numbers ascend eastward and northward with gaps in numbering to allow for future designations.

The route was originally designated as part of US 70 and US 80.
Historic route in New Mexico.
I-10 in Las Cruces once included a Las Cruces business loop. This former loop began at Exit 135 and followed US 70 (Picacho Ave.) to NM 478 at Main St. then followed that road to NM 188 where it turned onto Valley Dr. and returned to I-10 at Exit 142.
Texas.
All of the business loops within Texas are maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Interstate 10 has four business loops in the state, each located in the far western Trans-Pecos region. Along I-10, TxDOT identifies each business route as Business Interstate 10 followed by an alphabetic suffix. Along Texas Interstates, the alphabetic suffixes on business route names ascend eastward and northward. There are gaps in the alphabetic values to allow for future system expansion. The alphabetic naming suffixes are included as small letters on the bottom of route shields.

Technology of the Dune universe

The technology of the "Dune" universe is a key aspect of the fictional setting of the "Dune" series of science fiction novels written by Frank Herbert, and derivative works. Herbert's concepts and inventions have been analyzed and deconstructed in at least one book, "The Science of Dune" (2008). Herbert's originating 1965 novel "Dune" is popularly considered one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time, and is frequently cited as the best-selling science fiction novel in history. "Dune" and its five sequels by Herbert explore the complex and multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology and technology, among other themes.
The Butlerian Jihad, an event in the back-story of Herbert's universe, leads to the outlawing of certain technologies, primarily "thinking machines", a collective term for computers and artificial intelligence of any kind. This prohibition is a key influence on the nature of Herbert's fictional setting. In "Dune", ten thousand years after this jihad, its enduring commandment remains:
Atomics.
Atomics is the term used to refer to nuclear weapons in the "Dune" universe. Like real-world nuclear weapons, atomics presumably derive their destructive force from nuclear reactions of fission or fusion, and Herbert notes that "radiation lingers" after their use. However, the author never delves into the specifics of the technology or explores in detail how it may have evolved by the time of "Dune"'s far-future setting.
In the initial "Dune" novels, the Great Houses of the Landsraad own "family atomics" as heirlooms, keeping a secure, hidden cache as weapons of last resort in their wars. Though such possession is necessary to secure power, the use of atomics against humans violates the chief prohibition of the Great Convention, the "universal truce enforced under the power balance maintained by the Guild, the Great Houses, and the Imperium". Paul Atreides notes in "Dune" that "The language of the Great Convention is clear enough: "Use of atomics against humans shall be cause for planetary obliteration"." The atomics themselves act as a military deterrent—any House which violates the Great Convention flagrantly (such as using atomics openly in warfare) faces the possibility of massive retaliation from any number of the other Houses. As Paul notes via epigraph in "Dune Messiah" (1969), "any Family in my Empire could so deploy its atomics as to destroy the planetary bases of fifty or more other Families".
One type of atomic weapon is the stone burner, the explosion and radiation of which can be precisely adjusted depending on the desired effect. Stone burners emit "J-Rays", a form of radiation that has a tendency to destroy the eye tissue of anyone surviving the initial radiation blast. If of sufficient power, a stone burner can burn its way into the core of a planet, destroying it:
The original series.
In "Dune", Paul uses an atomic device on the surface of Arrakis to blast a pass through a wild desert mountain range called the Shield Wall. He considers this act to be in accordance with the Great Convention because the atomics are not used against humans, but rather against "a natural feature of the desert". A stone burner is used in an attempt to assassinate Paul in "Dune: Messiah"; he survives but is blinded for the rest of his life. In "God Emperor of Dune" (1981), the God Emperor Leto II notes that since his 3,500-year reign began he has "searched out all of the Family atomics and removed them to a safe place".
Prequels.
In the "Prelude to Dune" prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (1999–2001) it is revealed that a renegade House of the Landsraad had devastated the capital of the Corrino Padishah Empire, Salusa Secundus, with atomics and rendered the planet essentially uninhabitable. Padishah Emperor Hassik Corrino III had relocated the Imperial throne to the planet Kaitain, and the attacking House had been subsequently exterminated. During the events of the series in 10,175 A.G., Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV uses atomics to destroy House Richese's artificial laboratory moon of Korona. Part of Shaddam's plan to ensure his own spice monopoly, the explosion causes a quarter of the planet Richese's population to go blind from the resulting light produced by the destruction of the Richesian mirrors stored on Korona. Finally, the persecuted Earl Dominic Vernius plans to use atomics to attack Kaitain; when his hidden base on Arrakis is discovered by the Padishah Emperor's Sardaukar army, Vernius ignites a stone burner to destroy himself and as many of the Sardaukar as he can.
The "Legends of Dune" prequel series (2002–2004) establishes that the first human victory of the Butlerian Jihad (the crusade against the thinking machines) is the 200 B.G. destruction of Earth and the Earth Omnius using atomics. "Pulse atomics" calibrated for use against the gel circuitry of the thinking machines are also used at end of the war to systematically wipe out every single machine-controlled planet. It is this action, and the millions of human slaves who are killed in it, which ultimately leads to the ban on atomic warfare in the Great Convention. It also contributes to the development of the feud between the Harkonnens and Atreides.
Axlotl tank.
Axlotl tanks are a fictional technology in the "Dune" universe created by Frank Herbert. Axlotl technology is also mentioned in Herbert's novels "" and the "The Jesus Incident" but not elaborated upon. The name is presumably derived from the axolotl, an aquatic salamander native to Mexico known for its regenerative abilities.
A trade secret of the Tleilaxu, an axlotl tank is a "device for reproducing a living human being from the cells of a cadaver", a type of clone called a ghola. Later in the series, the axlotl tanks are engineered to be capable of also replicating the spice melange, previously only available on the desert planet Arrakis where it is created naturally as part of the life cycle of giant sandworms.
The original series.
The tanks are briefly mentioned in "" (1969) as the source of the Duncan Idaho ghola. Their nature is a well-guarded Tleilaxu secret. During his 3500-year reign which ends in "God Emperor of Dune" (1981), Leto II purchases countless Idaho gholas produced for him in the tanks.
Within the 1500 years between the events of "God Emperor of Dune" and "Heretics of Dune" (1984), the Tleilaxu discover an artificial method of producing the spice melange in their axlotl tanks as well. Some melange users, like the Bene Gesserit, prefer the natural melange of Arrakis to the Tleilaxu substitute, claiming increased potency.
In "Heretics of Dune", Miles Teg recalls how his Bene Gesserit mother Lady Janet had said that "No one outside of Tleilaxu planets has ever reported seeing a Tleilaxu female." Wondering whether the Tleilaxu breed or simply rely on the tanks to reproduce, Miles had asked, "Do they exist or is it just the tanks?" Janet confirmed that females do indeed exist. Later in "Heretics", Teg's own daughter, Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade, theorizes that the axlotl tanks may be, in fact, "surrogate mothers"—Tleilaxu females somehow transformed. Soon, the current Duncan ghola recalls his repeated "births" from the tanks:
The axlotl tanks! He remembered emerging time after time: bright lights and padded mechanical hands. The hands rotated him and, in the unfocused blurs of the newborn, he saw a great mound of female flesh—monstrous in her almost immobile grossness…a maze of dark tubes linked her body to giant metal containers.
In "", the last remaining Tleilaxu Master Scytale is coerced into revealing the means of creating the tanks to the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood.
"Prelude to Dune".
In the "Prelude to Dune" prequel trilogy (1999–2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (the plot which occurs before the events of 1965's "Dune"), the Tleilaxu attempt to create artificial melange called "ajidamal" using axlotl technology; the best results are gained by using a Bene Gesserit sister to create an axlotl tank. However, the project ultimately fails.
Final sequels.
Both "Hunters of Dune" and "Sandworms of Dune" deal with the ramifications of Sisterhood volunteers for the process, including the Jewish Reverend Mother which upsets her father.
Cymek.
A cymek is a type of cyborg, or machine-human hybrid, in the fictional "Dune" prequel universe. They appear in the "Legends of Dune" prequel trilogy (2002–2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. The only organic part of a cymek is its brain; in the series, living humans willingly have their brains transplanted into large mechanized bodies with the intent of extending life indefinitely.
"Legends of Dune".
Over 11,000 years before the events of Frank Herbert's "Dune" (1965), a group of 20 ambitious humans see the stagnation of the Old Empire and realize that their small band can take control of it with the aid of thinking machines. Calling themselves the Titans, they rule humanity for a hundred years and rename themselves after famous historical and mythological figures, most notably Agamemnon, Ajax, Barbarossa, Dante, Hecate, Juno, Tlaloc and Xerxes.
Ten years into their reign, their leader Tlaloc is killed in a freak accident. Realizing their mortality and limited lifespans, they seek a way to extend their lives. Juno is inspired by the cogitors, ancient philosophers whose brains had been installed in fluid-filled canisters so that they might analyze the universe indefinitely; they are living and retain awareness and consciousness, and the ability to communicate should they choose. The Titan Agamemnon is the first to become a cymek, his brain transplanted into a canister which, through special interfaces, is installed into a large, fearsome, and weaponized body. In cymek form, the remaining 19 Titans are virtually unstoppable, and continue their tyrannical rule of the universe for another 90 years. Growing complacent, the Titans are themselves overthrown and enslaved by Omnius, a sentient computer network given too much autonomy; Omnius controls the universe for the next 900 years. The Titans recruit humans from the enslaved, Omnius-controlled "Synchronized Worlds" to become neo-cymeks, footsoldiers who could more fully understand human strategy and thought processes than machines.
A small group of worlds, united as the League of Nobles, resist the initial Titan rebellion and remain free from machine rule. With the thinking machines ever-persistent in their intent to enslave or destroy all humans, the League initiates the Butlerian Jihad, mankind's century-long crusade against the machines. The humans are ultimately victorious, destroying Omnius, the Titans, the neo-cymeks and all thinking machine forces. With all thinking machine technology henceforth banned, new organizations arise, composed of humans who had developed specialized skills during the Jihad to replace and exceed technology, including the Spacing Guild, Mentats, and the Bene Gesserit.
Ghola.
A ghola is a fictional creature in the "Dune" universe created by Frank Herbert. Similar to clones, they are "manufactured" human duplicates grown in an axlotl tank from cells collected from a deceased subject. A true ghola is initially shown to be the 'resurrection' of a corpse, through regrowth of damaged tissues, while later gholas in the series are more accurately described as clones—grown from genetic material extracted from a few cells (e.g. a small scraping of skin taken moments before death). Through specific stresses, gholas can be made to recall the memories of the original, including their moment of death. In Herbert's "Dune" series, the technological process is developed and initially monopolized by the Tleilaxu; in later novels the process is also used by the Bene Gesserit.
The first ghola featured in the series—Hayt in 1969's "Dune Messiah"—is a resurrection of the corpse of Duncan Idaho. Later gholas are grown from a few cells, as in the case of subsequent Idaho gholas provided to Leto II, as described in "God Emperor of Dune" (1981). The Tleilaxu can control their creations by forcing them into a hypnotic state with some predefined sound (often a specific humming or whistling noise) that has been pre-conditioned into each ghola.
The original series.
Before the events of "Dune: Messiah", gholas are merely physical copies without the memories of their original incarnations. The ghola Hayt is programmed by the Tleilaxu to kill Emperor Paul Atreides under post-hypnotic suggestion. The attempt fails but, as hoped by the Tleilaxu, the stress of attempting to kill someone who was deeply loved in the ghola's previous life breaks the mental barrier between the ghola's consciousness and the life memories of the original. Hayt recovers the full memories of the original Duncan Idaho. The Tleilaxu are now able to offer Paul a similar ghola "resurrection" of his deceased beloved Chani to gain leverage over him, but he refuses.
In "God Emperor of Dune", over Leto II's 3,500-year reign he has, as constant companions, a series of Duncan gholas with restored memories of the original Idaho but not the memories of the previous gholas. They are perfectly reconstructed incarnations made from a few cells, created as needed in the time span of one to two years. In this novel, one of the Duncans recalls how, as a blank ghola, he was tasked to kill a Face Dancer duplicate of Leto's father and Duncan's friend, Paul, and the psychological stress awakened his memories. Fifteen hundred years later in "Heretics of Dune" (1984), Leto is dead and the Bene Gesserit are the consumers of Duncan gholas. The current Idaho ghola recovers the memories of the original like his predecessors; however, the later attempt by the Honored Matre Murbella to sexually imprint him results in his recovery of the memories of all his ghola incarnations. It is later determined that the Tleilaxu had mixed the cells from multiple Idaho gholas to make this one—however recovery of genetic material from every incarnation would have been impossible for the Tleilaxu, indicating the development of some form of prescient or metaphysical awareness.
Though intense psychological trauma is the key to unlocking the memories of a ghola, the actual situation contrived to accomplish this is specific to each individual. When military genius Miles Teg is killed in "Heretics of Dune", a ghola of him is born in "" (1985) on orders from Teg's own daughter, Bene Gesserit leader Darwi Odrade. His former memories are unlocked using sexual imprinting.
The discovery of how to reawaken a ghola has tremendous consequences for the Tleilaxu Masters themselves; they subsequently use the technology of axlotl tanks and memory recovery to grant themselves effective immortality. Every Master is "recreated" upon his death with recovered memories, accumulating many generations of knowledge and experience and permitting planning on a timespan of millennia.
"Dune" games.
There are also mentions of gholas in the "Dune" games. In "Dune 2000" (1998), the Harkonnen Mentat is allegedly a ghola cloned from Tleilaxu flesh vats, and in "" (2001), House Ordos constantly deploy their own gholas in assassination and infiltration missions. This is particularly effective in tricking the Sardaukar and Fremen into allying with House Ordos. On a much larger scale, they plan to use a ghola of the now-deceased Corrino Emperor to claim the Golden Lion Throne, with the Executrix as the true leaders behind the so-called "puppet Emperor".
Heighliner.
A heighliner is a type of fictional starship used for interstellar travel in the "Dune" universe created by Frank Herbert. These enormous spaceships are the "major cargo carrier of the Spacing Guild's transportation system".
Duke Leto Atreides speaks of them in "Dune" (1965):
A Heighliner is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into a little corner—we'll be just a small part of the ship's manifest.
In Dune, it is stated that Heighliner operation requires a Guild Navigator, who uses a limited form of prescience (made possible by the spice Melange), to guide the ship at the very high speeds needed for interstellar travel. The later novels state that such travel requires both a Holtzman drive and a Guild Navigator. The drive uses the Holtzman effect to "fold space" and allow virtually instantaneous interstellar travel. The Navigator is needed to find a safe path through folded space and guide the ship. Navigators are confined to giant tanks, completely immersed in highly-concentrated orange spice gas.
Unable to land, heighliners jump from point to point, parking in planetary orbits, though the ship itself does not technically move. Orbital ferries or interplanetary spacecraft load and unload the heighliner. Special laws govern travel aboard a heighliner; heighliners are considered neutral territory and all acts of war aboard heighliners carry stiff penalties.
According to the "Legends of Dune" prequel trilogy (2002–2004), heighliners are invented by Norma Cenva during the Butlerian Jihad. The "Prelude to Dune" prequel trilogy (1999–2001) establishes that in subsequent millennia, the ships are manufactured on the planet Ix. During the events described in the 2001 prequel "", a heighliner is expertly spacefolded into a cavern under the surface of Ix, incapacitating an occupying army during the Atreides-led liberation of the planet. In the novel, heighliners are noted to be more than 20 kilometers long.
Holtzman effect.
The Holtzman effect is a fictional scientific phenomenon which makes defensive force shields and instantaneous space travel (among other things) possible through its application in Holtzman shields, foldspace or Holtzman drives, suspensors, and glowglobes.
Ixian Probe.
An Ixian Probe is a fictional device in Frank Herbert's "Dune" universe used to capture the thoughts of a person (living or dead) for analysis. Ixian Probes are mentioned in Herbert's "Heretics of Dune" (1984).
As described in "Heretics of Dune", the probe is an interrogation device of Ixian manufacture which "can raid the mind even of a dead person". However, the substance shere blocks the effects of the probe, and will protect a person who has taken it even in death. The probe itself or how it works are not described, but when Miles Teg sees a T-Probe for the first time, he believes it is an Ixian Probe. The T-Probe consists of a hood with a series of electrodes attached to the skull, controlled by an operator; the notable difference is that shere has no effect against a T-Probe.
Lasgun.
A lasgun (pronounced lāz-gŭn) is a fictional directed-energy weapon, specifically a laser gun, in the "Dune" universe created by Frank Herbert. In "Terminology of the Imperium", the glossary of the 1965 novel "Dune", Herbert provides the following definition:
LASGUN: continuous-wave laser projector. Its use as a weapon is limited in a field-generator-shield culture because of the explosive pyrotechnics (technically, subatomic fusion) created when its beam intersects a shield.
The interaction of a lasgun beam and a Holtzman field results in subatomic fusion and a nuclear explosion. The magnitude of this blast is unpredictable; sometimes it destroys only the shielded target and gunner, sometimes the explosion is more powerful than atomics. Using lasguns in a shielded environment can result in military and environmental catastrophe, though at one point in "Dune" Duncan Idaho deliberately allows shield-lasgun contact as a discouragement to his enemies. In "God Emperor of Dune" (1981), lasgun fire is described as "blue arcs"; a lasgun is noted to be "heavy" in "" (1985). A cutteray is described in "Dune" as a "Short-range version of a lasgun used mostly as a cutting tool and surgeon's scalpel".
No-chamber/No-ship.
A no-chamber is a fictional stealth technology in the "Dune" universe created by Frank Herbert. Originally called a no-room in Herbert's "God Emperor of Dune" (1981), it is a construct that hides anything inside from prescient vision, as well as more conventional means of detection, including sight. A no-globe is a larger construction of no-chambers, and a no-ship is a no-chamber in starship form, with enough limited prescience to be capable of interstellar travel without the use of a Guild Navigator.
The original series.
In "God Emperor of Dune", Leto II deduces that the new Ixian Ambassador Hwi Noree had been "born" in what would come to be known as a no-room to shield her creation and upbringing from him. Hwi had been created by the Ixians from the cells of Leto's friend/nemesis Malky but as Malky's direct opposite–using Tleilaxu ghola technology–designed to be irresistible to Leto. The no-room is an improvement upon a device the Ixians had previously created for Leto to record his thoughts into a written journal and hide them from prescient vision.
In "Heretics of Dune" (1984), Miles Teg, the Bene Gesserit Lucilla and the Duncan Idaho ghola hide in a no-globe on Gammu, created by the Harkonnens millennia before when the planet had been called Giedi Prime. It is a sizeable complex, noted to be "Very ancient but the chambers are still intact and functioning". The exact era of its creation is not specified, but it is written that "Gammu was Giedi Prime, a Harkonnen place…They were rich…Rich enough to accomplish the secret installation of a no-room…even of a large no-globe…Bribes, third-party purchases, many transshipments…The Famine Times were very disruptive and before that there were all those millennia of the Tyrant…When the Harkonnens kept their heads down or lost them."
No-ships are in use at the time of "Heretics of Dune"; like no-chambers, anything inside a no-ship is hidden from prescient vision and other means of detection, and the ship itself is invisible to sight or photography. However, a no-ship has much greater technological capability than a no-chamber, as it can perform the functions of a Guild Navigator. Specifically, a no-ship's computer is capable of enough limited prescience to successfully navigate its way through foldspace. Teg steals a massive no-ship from the fierce Honored Matres on Gammu in "Heretics of Dune", and its Great Hold alone is noted to be one kilometer in length, large enough to transport an adult sandworm. In "" (1985), the Bene Gesserit initially confine Duncan and Murbella to this no-ship on Chapterhouse for their own protection from prescient spying. As Murbella becomes the leader of a New Sisterhood composed of both the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres, Duncan and Teg flee Chapterhouse with Sheeana and other passengers on the no-ship.
In "Heretics of Dune" and "Chapterhouse Dune" it is suggested that certain characters of Atreides ancestry have the ability to use their prescient powers to "see" no-ships. This ability to nullify no-field invisibility is unleashed in Miles Teg after he is interrogated with a device called a T-Probe. Teg's subsequent ghola duplicate also retains that unique ability after his memories are re-awakened.
Sequels.
In "Hunters of Dune" (2006) and "Sandworms of Dune" (2007), the novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson which complete Frank Herbert's original series, the fleeing no-ship is named the "Ithaca" by its passengers in homage to the long journey of the mythological Greek hero Odysseus to his home of Ithaca. Accompanying Duncan, Teg and Sheeana are some 150 refugees, including the (apparent) last Tleilaxu Master Scytale, some Bene Gesserit Sisters, and a group of secret Jews. They seek a new world onto which to introduce the captive sandworms on board, as well as a new home for the Jews, but are in constant pursuit by the Unknown Enemy who seek to ensnare the ship in an inescapable tachyon net. With the help of genetic material possessed by Scytale, the passengers of the "Ithaca" begin growing gholas of historical heroes such as Paul Atreides and Lady Jessica to assist them in the final battle they know is coming against the Unknown Enemy.
"Prelude to Dune".
In the "Prelude to Dune" prequel trilogy (1999–2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, the creation of the Harkonnen no-globe is attributed to a man named Chobyn. He invents the technology and builds the no-globe for Baron Vladimir Harkonnen immediately prior to the events of "Dune" (1965). However, Chobyn is killed and the technology lost until it is reinvented by the Ixians millennia later during the reign of Leto II.
Ornithopter.
In the "Dune" universe created by Frank Herbert, an ornithopter (or thopter) is a type of aircraft that is one of the primary modes of transportation on the desert planet Arrakis. Herbert describes ornithopters as "Aircraft capable of sustained wing-beat flight in the manner of birds" in his 1965 novel "Dune". The craft achieve takeoff primarily though the beat of their wings, with jet power assisting in propulsion and stabilization:
Leto fed power to the wings, felt them cup and dip—once, twice. They were airborne in ten meters, wings feathered tightly and afterjets thrusting them upward in a steep, hissing climb.
The wings themselves, consisting of "delicate metal interleavings", are adjustable in length through a "retractor bar" or manually. They are fully extended when the jetpods are used little or not at all:
…the Duke kicked on the jet brakes. The ship bucked as its tail pods whispered to silence. Stub wings elongated, cupped the air. The craft became a full 'thopter as the Duke banked it, holding the wings to a gentle beat…
The wings are shortened when more jet thrust is used or the 'thopter uses the "jet-boost" alternative mode of takeoff, and tip to assist in braking.
In the 1984 film adaptation "Dune", ornithopters are depicted as wingless and jet- or rocket-propelled.
In the 2000 Sci Fi Channel miniseries "Frank Herbert's Dune" the ornithopters are replaced by tilt-rotors.
Stillsuit.
A stillsuit is a fictional body suit in Frank Herbert's "Dune" universe, first introduced in the 1965 novel "Dune" and appearing in every subsequent novel in the series. Stillsuits are worn by the native Fremen of the desert planet Arrakis to maintain their body moisture in the harsh environment. "The Science of Dune" (2008) analyzes Herbert's stillsuit and its feasibility in the real world as described.
Description.
As described in "Dune", a stillsuit is a "body-enclosing garment" of Fremen design which performs the "functions of heat dissipation and filtering bodily wastes", as well as retaining and reclaiming moisture. As the planetologist Liet-Kynes is assisting Duke Leto Atreides with the fitting of his stillsuit, he explains it in this manner:
It's basically a micro-sandwich—a high-efficiency filter and heat-exchange system. The skin-contact layer's porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body…near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers…include heat exchange filaments and salt precipitators. Salt's reclaimed. Motions of the body, especially breathing and some osmotic action provide the pumping force. Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck…Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to ensure a tight fit. Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit in good working order, you won't lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day…"
Analysis.
In his essay "Stillsuit" in "The Science of Dune", John C. Smith suggests that "Stillsuits designed using strict literal interpretations from the "Dune" books probably would not work and most likely would cook the wearer like a Crock-Pot…However, engineering solutions can be envisioned for all the suit's shortcomings."
T-Probe.
A T-Probe is a fictional device in Frank Herbert's "Dune" universe used to capture the thoughts of a person (living or dead) for analysis. T-Probes appear or are referenced in Herbert's "Heretics of Dune" (1984) and "" (1985), as well as the sequels "Hunters of Dune" (2006) and "Sandworms of Dune" (2007) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.
As described in "Heretics of Dune", the probe is a non-Ixian interrogation device brought by the Honored Matres from The Scattering. It is attached to the body through a series of "medusa contacts" placed around the skull and on major nerve centers. An operator can increase or decrease the power supplied to the probe to maximize its efficacy while at the same time not overloading the nervous system of the subject. While being subjected to the probe, Miles Teg's Mentat thinking deduces that not only can it "command his body as though he had no thinking part in his own behavior", but also "The whole spectrum of his senses could be copied into this T-probe and identified…The machine could trace those out as though it made a duplicate of him." The probe builds a 'digital framework' of the person which can be subjected to stimuli, and will respond as the person would. The T-Probe also causes massive, virtually unendurable pain in a living subject. Shere only prevents the T-Probe from recovering memories directly (as it does for the Ixian Probe) and does not impede any of the other features. Memories can still be guessed at from the model the probe constructs. The T-Probe is what causes Miles Teg's brain to change its structure, giving him the blinding speed and amazing abilities seen at the end of "Heretics of Dune". This mental alteration continues in Teg even after being 'reborn' as a Tleilaxu ghola in "Chapterhouse Dune".
Weirding Module.
A Weirding Module is a sonic weapon introduced in and specific to "Dune", the 1984 David Lynch film adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel of the same name. In the film, the device is a sonic beam weapon that translates specific sounds into attacks of varying potency, used by House Atreides and later by the Fremen armies. In the novel, Paul Atreides and his mother Lady Jessica teach the Fremen the Bene Gesserit martial art referred to by the Fremen as the weirding way.
Director David Lynch is said to have adapted the weirding way into the Weirding Module because he did not like the idea of "Kung-fu on sand dunes". The change literalizes Paul's line "My own name is a killing word". In the novel, the Fremen shout his Fremen name, "Muad'Dib", as a battle cry; in the film, the Fremen are surprised to find that saying "Muad'Dib" is a powerful trigger for the Weirding Module.
The Weirding Module appears in the computer games "Dune" (1992) and "" (2001), and the concept is adapted into "sonic tanks" for the games "Dune II" (1992) and "Dune 2000" (1998). There is no reference to this technology in the original novels.
Other technologies.
Herbert's series of "Dune" novels are peppered with other technologically advanced devices. In "Dune" (1965), water is scarce on the desert planet Arrakis; the native Fremen use a type of air well called a windtrap to condense moisture from the air and collect it in vast catch basins. They also collect moisture from the dead using a device called a deathstill. The Fremen accomplish long-distance coded communication using a distrans, a steganographic device that produces a "temporary neural imprint" on the nervous system of bats or birds. The message imprint is carried within the animal's normal cry, and can later be separated out using another distrans. A palm lock is a lock or seal keyed to a specific human hand, a solido is a projected three-dimensional image, and a poison snooper is a device which can detect poisons by analyzing radiation in the "olfactory spectrum". In "Dune", the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen employs a cone of silence, a sound-deadening field used for privacy, though it does not visually obscure lip movement. In "Heretics of Dune" (1984) Herbert mentions an Ixian damper, a similar, portable device described as a "black disc" which is buoyed midair by suspensors; it hides words from anyone without the proper coded translator, and projects distortions that hide the precise movements of lips and the sounds of voices.
Herbert mentions other unnamed technologies in the "Dune" series. In "Dune", the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam "tests" young Paul Atreides using a box that inflicts pain through "nerve induction". It is described as "a green metal cube about fifteen centimeters on a side", with one open side revealing a blackness so dark that no light penetrates it. Paul is forced to place his hand into the box and not remove it until Mohiam allows him. He experiences first coldness, tingling, then itching, followed by "the faintest burning" which soon intensifies to the point that "he could feel skin curling black on that agonized hand, the flesh crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained". The pain stops, and when he is permitted to remove his hand, it is unmarked and unharmed. This device is later referred to as the "agony box" in "Heretics of Dune", and is noted to be used for interrogation as well.
In "God Emperor of Dune" (1981), Moneo Atreides uses a "memocorder", a tiny handheld device described as "a dull black Ixian artifact whose existence crowded the proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad". In the same novel, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Anteac writes a message to be sent to her Sisterhood:
On Anteac's lap lay a small square of inky black about ten millimeters on a side and no more than three millimeters thick. She wrote upon this square with a glittering needle—one word upon another, all of them absorbed into the square. The completed message would be impressed upon the nerve receptors of an acolyte-messenger's eyes, latent there until they could be replayed at the Chapter House.
In "Heretics of Dune", Reverend Mother Lucilla recognizes a device called a "hypnobong" in use on the street, witnessing a passerby lean into a concave basin and then lift his face "with a shudder…staggering slightly, his eyes glazed". She notes that the device is "outlawed on all of the more civilized worlds".

Olympic Steel

Olympic Steel, Inc. is a steel processor with major production operations in the United States. The company has seventeen facilities throughout the eastern-half of the United States. It became a public company following an IPO in 1994. Olympic sells, processes, stores and trades flat-rolled steel in the United States and other countries.
Business Profile.
Olympic Steel, Inc. engages in the processing and distribution of processed carbon, coated and stainless flat-rolled sheet, and coil and plate steel products in the United States. Its services include cutting-to-length, slitting, and shearing. It also offers value-added processes such as blanking, tempering, plate burning, precision machining, welding, and fabricating and painting to process steel to specified lengths, widths, and shapes.
The company serves manufacturers and fabricators needing flat-rolled steel products. It operates as an intermediary between steel mills and steel consumers that require processed steel for their operations. These consumers include manufacturers of OEM products, heavy equipment and automobile manufacturers. Olympic also offers Toll Processing at some of its facilities. Toll Processing is essentially an outsourcing function: the steel owner does not have the machinery to process the steel, so it hands that steel over to a processor with specific instructions on how to cut, burn or otherwise process the steel.
History.
Olympic Steel was founded in 1954 by brothers Sol and Morris Siegal and Sam Sigel. Initially, it was a trading company and owned no facilities. In 1956, it opened an facility in Bedford Heights, Ohio. By 1966, the facility had grown to . The company offered multiple flat-rolled steel products, including coil and plate products.
In 1975, Michael Siegal, son of Sol Siegal, joined the company. The next year, the facility was again expanded to . By 1985, the company had founded a Southern sales office in Georgia and another office in Pennsylvania. Michael Siegal bought out his father's share of the company in 1984 and David Wolfort joined the company as General Manager.
In 1987, Olympic acquired Viking Steel Company, based in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. The following year the Philadelphia Division is formed by moving the Eastern sales office to a full warehouse facility in Lester, Pennsylvania. In 1989, the Southern Division moved to Greenville, South Carolina, consolidating several sales offices in the region and Olympic Steel Trading was formed to sell steel in Puerto Rico and Mexico.
In the early 1990s, Olympic would expand further by purchasing Eastern Steel in Milford, Connecticut, Juster Steel of Minneapolis, Minnesota and Lafayette Steel & Processing in Detroit, Michigan. Another facility is opened in Illinois to support the facility in Elk Grove Village. In 1994, the company offered 4,000,000 shares in an IPO. Two years later in 1996 it offered 2,500,000 more shares.
By the late 1990s, Olympic had moved into many new areas. Southeastern Metal Processing was purchased in Winder, Georgia in 1997. The company broke-ground on its second temper mill at a new facility in Bettendorf, Iowa. The following year, Olympic entered the machining business by purchasing the assets of JNT Machining and opening a new facility in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.
The early 2000s brought many changes to Olympic, which expanded further into machining and fabrication with the purchase of the new equipment. In 2006, it purchased the Siler City, North Carolina-based Tinsley Group. In 2007, the company's revenues exceeded US$1 billion for the first time. In 2008, it announced new fabrication facilities to be built in Dover, Ohio and Sumter, South Carolina.
In January, 2003, Richard T. Marabito, Chief Financial Officer of Olympic Steel, announced the promotion of Richard Manson, Director of Taxes & Risk Management who had been in the company since 1996, to Treasurer. On Feb 18, 2003, David K. Frink joined Olympic Steel, Inc. as Vice President Automotive.

Flux transfer event

Formation.
Earth's magnetosphere and the Sun's magnetic field are constantly pressed against one another on the dayside of Earth. Approximately every eight minutes, these fields briefly merge, forming a temporary "portal" between the Earth and the Sun through which high-energy particles such as solar wind can flow. The portal takes the shape of a magnetic cylinder about the width of Earth. Current observations place the portal at up to 4 times the size of the earth.
Simulations.
Since Cluster and THEMIS have directly sampled FTEs, scientists can simulate FTEs on computers to predict how they might behave. Jimmy Raeder of the University of New Hampshire told his colleagues simulations show that the cylindrical portals tend to form above Earth's equator and then roll over Earth's winter pole. In December, FTEs roll over the north pole; in July they roll over the south pole.
Flux transfer events beyond Earth.
Magnetic fields similar to Earth's are common throughout known space and many undergo similar flux transfer events. During its second flyby of the planet on October 6, 2008, the NASA probe MESSENGER discovered that Mercury’s magnetic field shows a magnetic reconnection rate ten times higher than Earth's. Mercury's proximity to the sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate observed by MESSENGER and the cause of this discrepancy is not currently known.

Clackamas Lake Ranger Station Historic District

The Clackamas Lake Ranger Station Historic District is a Forest Service compound consisting of eleven historic buildings located in the Mount Hood National Forest in the Cascade Mountains of northern Oregon. It was originally built as a district ranger station for the Clackamas Lake Ranger District. It was later converted to a summer guard station. Today, the Forest Service rents the historic ranger's residence to recreational visitors. The Clackamas Lake Ranger Station is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
In the 1920s and 1930s, forest road networks were not well developed. To facilitate work in National Forests, the Forest Service built district ranger stations at strategic locations within the forest to house full-time employees and provide logistics support to fire patrols and project crews working at remote forest sites. After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most forest areas within a few hours. As a result, many of the more isolated ranger stations were closed or converted to summer guard station.
The Forest Service began using the Clackamas Lake site in 1905. The original ranger cabin and barn were built by the district's first ranger, Joe Graham, in 1906. The compound was expanded during the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. All of the historic buildings that exist at the site today are from that era. The range station served as the summer administrative site for the Clackamas Lake Ranger District from 1906 until the 1952 when the compound was converted to a guard station for fire crews and work parties. After a short period of disuse in the 1960s, the guard station was reopened in the early 1970s. Since then, the site has remained in continuous use as a guard station, work center, recreation facility, and visitor center.
Because of the rustic architecture of the buildings and the site's unique historic value as an early Forest Service ranger station, the Clackamas Lake Ranger Station compound was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Place in 1981. The historic area covers .
Historic structures.
The ranger station is made up of eleven historic buildings and twelve other rustic, but non-historic, structures. In addition, the original ranger station landscaping still exists including picnic tables, a horseshoe pit, and stone fire pit. The historic district originally had twelfth historic building, but one ranger residence was destroyed by fire in 2003.
The ranger station's historic buildings include the district office, two ranger residences, a mess hall, a fire equipment warehouse, a separate road-and-trail warehouse, a gas station, garage, blacksmith shop, horse barn, and a pump house across the meadow. The district office is now a visitor center and museum. The ranger's residence can be rented by the public for $80 per night per on weekdays and $100 per night on weekends and holidays. Volunteer caretakers live on site, and help maintain the historic buildings, staffs the visitor center, and provide interpretive tours of the compound.
The ranger station buildings are wood and log-frame structures with concrete foundations. The exteriors are covered with wood shingles. Wooden shingles are also used for roofing. All the buildings are painted dark brown with dark brown trim so they blend into the surrounding forest landscape.
There is also a Forest Service campground next to the historic Clackamas Lake Ranger Station. The campground has 46 camp sites, potable drinking water, and several modern restrooms. The ranger station and campground are only a short distance to Clackamas Lake, and just three miles (5 km) from the much larger and very popular Timothy Lake. Trails for hiking, horseback riding, or mountain biking can easily be reach from the compound.
Location.
The Clackamas Lake Ranger Station is located in the a remote area of the Mount Hood National Forest, fifty miles southeast of Sandy, Oregon and twenty-two miles south of Government Camp, Oregon. The elevation at the site is . The forest around the guard station is dominated by old growth Douglas fir. 
To get to the Clackamas Lake Ranger Station from Sandy, travel east on U.S. Route 26 for approximately . Turn right onto Forest Road 42 (also known as Skyline Road) and travel south for past the intersection of Forest Roads 42 and 57. The historic Clackamas Lake Ranger Station is on the left, 1/4 miles past the junction. The ranger's residence is on the east side of the road across from the visitor center.

Cultural synergy

Cultural synergy is a term coined from work by Nancy Adler of McGill University which describes an attempt to bring two or more cultures together to form an organization or environment that is based on combined strengths, concepts and skills. The differences in the world's people are used in such a way that encourages mutual growth by cooperation. 
In a more general sense, cultural synergy can be observed in the creation new or reproduced cultural forms that are distinct from the cultures from which those forms are derived. In either case, cultural synergy may be expected to be more prevalent as globalization takes place., and the concept and/or phrase can be found in discussions of globalization.

As it is state-maintained, unlike most business routes in California, it is assigned route numbers - part of U.S. Route 50 on its western half (5.64 miles/9.08 km), and unsigned State Route 51 on its eastern half (8.86 miles/14.26 km). The full road is a freeway, and carried Interstate 80 until 1981, when the signage and designation of Interstate 80 was transferred to the Beltline Freeway, previously signed as Interstate 880. At that time, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) assigned the Interstate 305 designation to the west half, which met Interstate Highway standards. However, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has never signed this number, put it on any road signs, or used it internally.

Inalchuq

Inalchuq (or Inalchuk) (died 1219) was governor of Otrar in the Khwarezmian Empire in the early 13th century, known mainly for helping to provoke the successful invasion of Khwarezmia by Genghis Khan.
Inalchuq was an uncle of Sultan Muhammad II of Khwarezmia. His name meant "little Inal", and he held the title Ghayir-Khan.
In 1218, a Mongolian trade caravan of around 450 men arrived in Otrar, including an ambassador of Genghis Khan. Inalchuq accused them of being Mongolian spies and arrested them. There may in fact have been spies in the caravan; however Inalchuq may have also been provoked by having been called Inalchuq rather than the less familiar Ghayir-Khan by one of the members of the caravan, or perhaps was motivated by simply wanting to seize the caravan's riches. With the assent of Sultan Muhammed, he executed the entire caravan, and its goods were sold in Bukhara. A camel driver escaped this massacre to report back to Genghis Khan, who responded by sending a delegation to Sultan Muhammad demanding Inalchuq be punished. Muhammad responded by beheading the ambassador and shaving off the beards of his two companions, provoking Genghis Khan's invasion.
Genghis Khan besieged Otrar for five months in 1219, eventually breaching its walls. Inalchuq barricaded himself in its inner citadel, and as the Mongols wished to capture him alive in order to publicly execute him, he managed to hold out another month. Eventually he was trapped with his last remaining bodyguards on the upper floors of the citadel, resorting to throwing bricks down on the Mongols, and was captured and executed.

The second USS "Osceola", later AT-47, was a United States Navy armed tug in commission in 1898 and in combat in the Spanish-American War, and from 1911 to 1922.
"Osceola" was laid down as the commercial tug "Winthrop" by Charles Hillman, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1896. Completed in 1897, "Winthrop" was purchased by the U.S. Navy from Staples Coal Company on 21 March 1898 and commissioned on 4 April 1898 as the United States made final preparations for the approaching war with Spain.
"Osceola" saw immediate action after commissioning as the United States became involved in the Spanish-American War. She joined the force at Key West, Florida in May 1898, in preparation for duty in the blockade of Cuba.
In the attack on Cabañas, Cuba, "Osceola" prepared for towing disabled ships, up to a dozen at a time. In July 1898 she joined armed yacht in a reconnaissance of Manzanillo, Cuba. On 18 July 1898 "Osceola" and "Scorpion" joined in the major attack on Manzanillo, an attack causing severe losses to the Spaniards. In August "Osceola" joined the strong force that captured the port. The armistice that brought the war to a close soon followed, on 13 August 1898. Decommissioned after the war, "Osceola" was laid up.
"Osceola" recommissioned on 1 July 1911. On 16 March 1912, she would tow the hulk of the U.S.S. "Maine", whose 1898 destruction precipitated the Spanish-American War, to its final resting place in international waters.
During World War I, she steamed to Guantanamo Bay in 1918 and remained there as station ship through 1920. In 1920, as part of the U.S. Navy's institution of an alphanumeric hull classification system, she was designated AT-47 as a seagoing tug.
In 1921 "Osceola" became part of a special U.S. Navy squadron organized to patrol Caribbean waters to promote friendly relations between the United States and Latin America. In 1922 she steamed to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and returned to the United States that autumn.
"Osceola" decommissioned and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 November 1922. She was sold to F. E. Pope of Washington, D.C. on 24 March 1923.

Hebei District

Hebei District () is a district of the municipality of Tianjin, People's Republic of China. Its name literally means "District north of the River", as the district is located on the northern shore of the Hai River, part of the Grand Canal. Tianjin's famous Zhongshan Park lies within the district. Tianjin's North Train Station and many other train structures are also located in Hebei District. The district administers ten streets in total.
Administrative divisions.
There are 10 subdistricts in the district:

Donal Dineen

Donal Dineen is an Irish radio presenter, photographer, film maker and former television presenter from County Kerry. Until recently he presented an assortment of electronica and world music on his "Small Hours" (formerly "Here Comes the Night") late-night radio show on Today FM. This show has now been cancelled for commercial reasons. He is also known for presenting the now defunct "No Disco" TV series on Network 2.
Career.
Dineen studied communications in Dublin City University. It was here that he first picked up a camera as it was part of his course. From this point onwards he developed a fascination with the visual image. His first exhibition, This Storm is an Angel, for Galway Arts Festival in 1993, was a series of photographs taken around his home in Kerry, which focused on family, place and identity. 2009 exhibitions include an installation for the Dublin Electronic Arts Festival (DEAF) entitled "Words Are Something Else", and solo photographic shows for Kilkenny Arts Festival and The Joinery Gallery, Dublin.
Musically, Dineen is credited with breaking David Gray amongst other artists in Ireland. His programme, "Here Comes The Night", was first aired on the opening day of Radio Ireland (now Today FM)'s existence, 17 March 1997. He later moved to the "Small Hours" show, which broadcast between Monday and Thursday in the midnight - 2AM slot. 
On 30 December 2007, "The Small Hours" had a two-hour radio special broadcast from the living room of David Gray's London home, where Gray and Liam Ó Maonlaí traded songs and stories on the piano and acoustic guitar, "intermittently picking their Desert Island discs for Dineen to spin". Dineen also had a line-up in the Body & Soul area of Electric Picnic 2008. 
As a curator, Dineen has worked on several musical series, most significantly A Month of Sundays [http://www.myspace.com/onemonthofsundays] which was devised with The Model Arts and Niland Gallery Sligo in 2006 and evolved into a touring series in 2007. 
In November 2009 he curated a mini festival called Fresh Air which profiled "his selection of the most exciting and experimental sound makers working today. The aim is to bring to light the sheer diversity and calibre of music being made on these shores, and to bring new music, live or recorded, to air". [http://freshairfestival.wordpress.com]

A World At War

A World At War is a board wargame published by GMT Games, simulating the Second World War in Europe and the Pacific. It is a descendant of Avalon Hill's games Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun. The emphasis of the game system has shifted from novel and far-fetched strategies (pre-1992 versions of the game) to diplomacy ("A3R") to studying the effect of changes in a country’s forcepool. "A World At War" is exceptionally complex - articles on previous versions should be read for explanations of some game concepts and this article concentrates on changes to the game system rather than attempting a comprehensive summary.
Basic Mechanics & Map.
The Axis always move first, whatever the BRP (Basic Resource Point) total, so there are no longer any double turns; the opening Japanese double-turn is replaced by Allied paralysis in the following player-turn.
Forest has been added to the map in Scandinavia and parts of northern Russia, making the area between Leningrad (now a swamp instead of a printed fortress) and Moscow easier to defend. The river Elbe has been added to Germany, whilst the Rhine has been shifted one hex east so that the map can depict the Rhineland, containing Cologne and Mannheim.
Land Warfare.
Any supplied unit, including replacements, may now move one hex per turn, regardless of zones of control, weather, terrain or oil status; all replacements begin the game on the map. Rough terrain (but not rivers) costs an extra movement point. Armoured exploitation from rough terrain is reduced by 1 in Europe and forbidden in the Pacific (except for the Japanese, who may exploit out of jungle).
Winter effects now apply on all fronts. In the West, including western Poland, winter overruns and exploitation are forbidden (similar to Spring on the Eastern Front), so a German attack in the West in Winter 1939 probably won’t get any further than the Low Countries. The Mediterranean has a mild winter, in which exploitation is reduced by 4 (to a minimum of 1); this does not apply at all in Mediterranean islands or in Africa, but effectively prevents a quick German conquest of Spain & Gibraltar in Winter 1940. The severity of the Russian Winter is decided by die roll as before - in the Second Edition Germany may make some limited attacks in milder Russian Winters, but in winter turns Russia may select the hexes from which Germany must take her attrition losses, putting key units at risk.
The game now distinguishes between fortifications (+1 DM to land and air defence) built in jungle, city or coastal hexes, and fortresses printed on the map (+2 DM except for the WestWall). If unsupplied (Malta may be “besieged” by Axis air units) they degrade by 1 DM per turn, but units in a fort are never eliminated due to isolation and always defend at a minimum of face value. Coastal fortresses may no longer be bombarded by naval units.
There are some new combat results: “a” (attacker loses half the modified value of the defending units), “d” (defender loses half his factors, ignoring DMs), “Ex-1” (defenders all eliminated, attacker loses strength equal to that of the defence with DM one less than what they actually had – if this gives a value of zero, the value of the defensive air support) and “Ex-2” (as for the previous, but with DM reduced by two).
Germany and Japan start with CTL (Combat Training Level) 2, the Allies and Russians start with CTL1, and minor countries CTL0. CTL 2 allows an attack to be renewed for a second round (with a +1 DRM); CTL 3, if obtained by research, would allow a third round. Armour needs CTL1 to exploit half its movement allowance, and CTL2 to exploit fully, whilst paratroops and commandos need CTL2 for use – making the higher CTL an advantage for the Germans in the early years. Another bonus for the Germans is than an "Ex" result from overrun and exploitation against Poland and in her first two offensives in the west (no later than Summer 1940) is treated as a "Ex-1".
For attrition the relative CTL is used as a DRM (i.e. Germany has a +1 advantage at the start - units may be omitted to raise the CTL), as is the difference in the level of Winter Preparation in winter turns. The ban on taking rough hexes or across rivers now applies in Europe as well as the Pacific. Units behind a fortress hexside may not be attritioned. Separate supply zones are attritioned separately. No nation may lose more units to attrition than she had at the relevant front (i.e. a faction may not take many losses from units held in reserve despite that country only having a few units at the front). Partisans no longer take part in attrition.
Air Warfare.
Air (and naval) factors are uninverted ready for use at the end of each player-turn, not game turn (except newly built air factors redeployed on the turn they are built), making it easier to use air factors to defend key hexes just captured. Airbases may not be moved other than by recycling (removing an old one and placing a new one, once during movement and once during construction/redeployment for Germany and the USA, other countries limited to once per turn). Countries may obtain more airbases by production.
Air combat has a new table, similar to the naval combat table: each side simultaneously rolls two dice, killing or aborting enemy factors, with multiple combat rounds possible - the attacker may be reinforced between rounds. Air units now defend against counterair even if inverted. The defender may break off air combat after any round by evacuating to another base (and inverting there). Defenders aborted in the final round are inverted, whoever won. Victorious defenders are not inverted after counterair, and may conduct defensive missions later that player turn. Friendly air factors may “escort” Defensive Air Support against interception.
Air transport factors, as well as being used for airdrops or air supply (each may carry limited supply for one unit), can carry 1 infantry factor or a specialised unit, or 5 BRPs "over the Hump" to China (in the latter case, only one ATF may fly from and to each airbase). They do not fight back if intercepted, but may be defended by friendly air units in range. Paratroops are now reduced to division-sized units worth 1 combat factor, and can move before dropping. Defenders have +1 DM if solely attacked by paratroops, and paratroops are no longer automatically supplied after dropping.
Kamikazes no longer defend against enemy aircraft; they are no longer doubled to attack ships, but instead attack with +4 DRM. Kamikazes pick targets at random (carriers, then battleships, in order of size and slowness, then light ships as a group, damaged ships first in every category) in the same way as submarines; they combine their attack if more than one selects the same target.
Jets - only available after a high research result - fight at triple strength and have a +1 modifier in combat.
For activities at sea each Army Air Factor splits into search, cover and attack squadrons. Only 1/3, not ½, of a naval force’s Air Squadrons may fly CAP. In combat involving CAP or air cover, the smaller side (usually the defender) engages an equal number of the enemy. Air attacks on ports are rationalised whether from sea or land – defending air factors fight even if they were not attacked. Naval Air Squadrons on carriers in port may be counteraired. Escort Carriers count for triple for air defence.
Naval Warfare.
Ports now base 50 naval factors (not 36). 10 naval factors (not 9) based in a hex prevent it from being invaded. Base changing and offensive missions have a maximum range of 40 hexes in Europe (20 in the Pacific because of the larger scale); most missions must touch on a friendly port every 20 hexes in Europe (10 in the Pacific); 1-hex islands can no longer base naval factors (although they can still base 1 NAS) or be used to measure range.
Patrols, besides taking out any enemy air within range of the patrol hex, may counterair any enemy air on their way there. Friendly units on patrol may not counter-intercept but may move up to three hexes towards the interception hex before each round of combat.
Generic naval factors have been replaced by "destroyers" (DDs) – single factors, representing any ship smaller than a cruiser. Fewer factors are now needed - 1 DD to transport a ground factor, 2 for an opposed invasion. The number of DDs determines how strong an invasion a country can threaten; in the second edition defensive air support is tripled against invasions - making invasions beyond air support unfeasible. Destroyers can also carry BRPs, or oil. Cruisers (2-factor counters, presumably representing a single heavy or pair of light cruisers) are used only for combat, sharing the losses with the destroyers. The game includes named battleships, rated between 5 ("Yamato", "Musashi", "USS Missouri"), and 2 ("Graf Spee").
Naval units may now be intercepted after completing their mission. Interception is determined depending on the activity which is being intercepted, e.g. extra dice are rolled to intercept invasions (especially in the invasion hex) or patrols remaining on station (of which interception is no longer quite automatic). Spotting air factors add extra dice. Whatever the result of the dice roll (halved in the Pacific), the interceptors move that many hexes towards the target and if necessary can roll again, a single die after each round of naval combat. Slow ships, e.g. older battleships (marked with an orange stripe) and escort carriers, roll one fewer interception die.
Air attack and naval gunfire have been consolidated onto a single table, with two air squadrons more lethal than a normal-sized battleship. In a simplification from “Empire of the Rising Sun”, a hit result greater than or equal to the number of a ship’s factors sinks it, a result one less damages it, whilst any lesser result is disregarded. Large ships are hard to sink but may suffer critical hits.
In naval combat, each separate taskforce forms a combat group - taskforces do not split up. Defending CAP is no longer added to a fleet’s air defence level, nor do aircraft carriers make separate defence rolls. Each side rolls one search die for each searching air squadron (up to three, even if all based in the same base), each friendly combat group and each round of fleet combat which has occurred. Each search die rolled “finds” the enemy combat group, if any, to whose number it corresponds (i.e. a roll of “3” finds enemy Combat Group 3). A combat group must be “found” at least once in order to be attacked; if “found” by two or more dice information about its composition must be revealed. Groups which were not found may launch airstrikes – rolling for surprise if they consist entirely of fast ships - at any found enemy group. Surprise is more likely the more search dice the enemy group has been found by, and less likely the more airstrikes it has already suffered, and if it has radar. Once the hidden groups have finished their airstrikes, found combat groups may each launch airstrikes at any found enemy combat group, the side with the more search results first. Land-based air then attack; land-based air and CAP may defend even if they have already fought that round.
After the first airstrike, a found combat group must engage in fleet combat with the enemy combat group with the same number, if that too has been found. Hidden groups, provided they did not launch a surprise airstrike, may engage any found enemy combat group, although a hidden group containing slow ships may only engage the enemy combat group with the same number, if found. Battleships face off in order of size, so the side with more battleships may fire at light ships before they have a chance to retaliate. Escort carriers are treated as destroyers in fleet combat, their combat factor representing emergency airstrikes. Fast carriers, transports, damaged ships and DD carrying cargo are screened, and may not be fired upon until all other naval units in their group are sunk.
Neither side may withdraw until at least one airstrike or round of fleet combat has occurred, although withdrawal is compulsory after three rounds of combat without a naval unit being damaged or sunk.
Strategic Warfare.
The 10% annual limit on SW construction has gone; countries now have force pools for SW, which are built each turn like any other unit, and SW units are larger. All available factors, not just 25% of them, may be used each turn. Strategic bombers require a high research result, but Britain and the USA qualify from the start. Army Air Factors may no longer convert into interceptors, which may only enter the game via production.
Submarines (but not ASW - anti-submarine warfare ships) may operate on the map. Italian and British submarines may not be used for SW; Germany may send 1 submarine factor per turn to the Mediterranean, or more if she controls Gibraltar; Japan and the USA are limited as to the number of submarines (increasing throughout the war) they may use for SW. Onboard submarines may operate from ports, may patrol, or may accompany naval units, although they roll 2 fewer interception dice than surface ships. Submarines may attack light ships or a named ship, in which case each submarine factor picks a target at random, being most likely to pick a fast carrier, then a battleship, biggest then slowest first, and damaged ships first in every case.
Strategic Warfare combat is resolved by simultaneous die roll, and the net modifier is applied to each side (in opposite directions). Britain must now trace a convoy route, which may be attacked, from the USA to Britain on the European map. Submarines no longer reduce enemy BRPs, but instead sink Allied and Japanese transports - counters which represent ocean-going shipping. After combat with ASW, each surviving submarine then inflicts a further loss of 1 transport, increased or reduced by the net SW modifier; even if no attacking submarines survive combat, a fraction of the net SW modifier still inflicts loss on the defenders. Although most naval units may no longer directly participate in submarine warfare, Allied (not Japanese) destroyers may permanently convert to ASW or transports. Loss of transports to surface raiders and submarines, besides the cost of rebuilding them, inflicts a BRP penalty for falling below minimum transport levels in the relevant ocean box, and reduces a country’s ability to move units and oil through mapboard boxes (only some of the transports in the relevant ocean may carry oil).
Bombers must bomb a specific target on the map. Interceptors, jets and air factors in range may escort bombers to share the combat losses. First, defending air factors within range, using radar if they have it, attack at least an equal number of attackers. Then, simultaneously, the target hex fires in defence and bombers roll to inflict BRP losses on the target hex. After combat, each surviving bomber then inflicts a further loss of 3 BRPs, increased or reduced by the net SW modifier; even if no attacking bombers survive combat, a fraction of the net SW modifier still inflicts loss on the defenders. 25 BRPs bombing damage on a hex creates a firestorm, which gains a DP for the attacker and, if inflicted on Japan, increases the chance of the defender surrendering.
Construction & Redeployment.
Only China is limited to spending half her BRPs per turn. Other major powers have a Unit Construction Limit (UCL) of 1/3 of their base; Russian Inustrial Centres count as base for this, giving the Russians a huge UCL, whereas BRPs from conquests do not directly increase Germany’s UCL. A third of BRP grants each turn are added to the UCL of the recipient country and deducted from the grantor's. The relevant UCL is reduced for BRPs lost to Axis attritioning of the Australia, India or Urals box, or to bombing, flying bomb (V1) or rocket (V2) attacks, or to British (not US or Japanese) transport losses below required levels.
Units which were eliminated voluntarily or due to isolation (such units may now take a free offensive before removal) may be rebuilt in the same turn for double BRP cost. Specialised units (e.g. paratroops) may be rebuilt after a 1–turn delay. Germany loses 5 BRPs from her UCL if ore shipments from Sweden are cut off.
Naval Air Training Rates are higher as newly built as well as rebuilt Naval Air Squadrons count against NAT limits. British and US CVE-building are limited by, but do not count against the limit (i.e. the USA may use her NAT of 4 to build 4 NAS and 4 CVE factors each turn).
Scripted force pool additions have been replaced by "mobilisations". When a major power conducts a mobilisation, it receives BRPs and also chooses units up to a certain BRP value to add to its forcepool (some types of unit, e.g. armour, take a year or two to appear). Britain and Italy each mobilise once, early in the game. Other powers mobilise several times, before and after they enter the war: Japan mobilises four times, Russia five, whilst the USA mobilises twelve times in each theatre. Countries may also augment their forcepools by spending research points on "production". These additions to the forcepool are a distinct process from spending the BRPs to bring units from the forcepool onto the map. There is no production or mobilisation of naval units, of which construction is limited only by shipyard capacity (which may itself be increased by either mobilisation or production).
Each shipyard is tracked separately. Each generates shipbuilding points (SBP) each turn, needed to build or repair a naval factor on top of the BRP cost. For each SBP generated in a port each turn, an equal number of naval factors may be stored “under construction”. A named ship may be delayed (perhaps indefinitely as Britain did with the "Lion" class battleships) to use SBP on light ships instead, or scrapped altogether to free up capacity. Only half, rounded up, of US (and, in the Second Edition, British) SBP, tracked separately for each theatre, may be spent on light ships. Big ships take several years to build, but may be accelerated by paying extra. Before she goes to war the USA may lay down one fast carrier for each one carrier under construction which is launched, or each new one laid down by Japan (or Germany, who begins the game with the "Graf Zeppelin" under construction).
National limits on Strategic Redeployment (SR) have gone – instead each country may send and receive 2 units and 5 AAF each turn from each objective it controls. Major powers (but not France or China) may build one railhead per turn on a non-objective city to use it as a base for SR; the railhead may not be moved or destroyed, and may be used by the enemy if captured. Before SR any supplied air or ground unit not adjacent to an enemy may tactically redeploy (TR) up to its movement capability (reduced by terrain and weather) irrespective of front boundaries, and those which SRd may TR a second time afterwards. This gives players much more flexibility, whilst limiting SRs to remote parts of the map.
Supply, Oil & Economics.
Moscow is no longer a supply source - Russian units must trace supply to the Urals box - nor are Basra, Suez, Truk, Brunei or Palembang. Synthetic oil plants give unlimited supply, as does Berchtesgaden if the National Redoubt has been created. Major power objective hexes and conquered major capitals now give limited supply.
A sea supply line must touch on a friendly port every 20 hexes (10 in the Pacific), and can be defended by naval units in the originating port, in any port on which it touches, or in any SW box through which it is traced (specific naval units in the SW box must be earmarked to defend specific supply lines). Other naval units can't defend the supply line, but may counter-intercept attempts to cut it. Air cover may also be given.
Besides those in Rumania and the Dutch East Indies, oil centres – each with a printed number, showing how many oil counters they produce each turn - have been added in the USA (unlimited), Iraq, Iran and the Caucasus. Each faction (Allies, Russians, Germans and Japanese) must expend one oil counter to offset each of the five oil effects: full use of air, naval, or armour units, UCL halved except for BRP grants received from another power, and economic (10% of the base permanently lost). A faction thus needs at least 5 oil counters each turn to operate at full capacity, and another 3 for each separate supply zone – the Allies need to transport oil from the USA. Major powers may keep off-map oil reserves, which they may increase by voluntarily taking oil effects.
There are more Key Economic Areas. Germany’s entire starting base of 150 BRPs consists of KEAs (50 of them in Berlin), so Germany can no longer continue after losing all her major cities.
Most countries now start Fall 1939 with less than a full year’s supply of BRPs. A country’s economic base may now grow in the 1940 Year Start Sequence, although the value of unbuilt ground and air units is deducted from surviving BRPs before the remainder may grow. Strategic Warfare losses no longer reduce a country’s base, but deficit spending (which may not exceed the UCL or BRP base, and is not allowed for France, Italy or China) does. The total of all BRP gains and losses at the end of the diplomacy phase, and of losses at the end of the combat phase (including Russian ICs), is pro-rated: 75% in summer, 50% in fall, 25% in winter. If a minor country is conquered, the conqueror gains the prorated BRPs in his next diplomatic phase. In the construction phase a power may "scorch" the prorated BRPs of a conquest, leaving it worth 0 BRPs until the next YSS. The BRP value of many conquered territories has now been reduced.
Permitted US pre-war BRP grants to Britain increase with US-Axis tensions. The Allies may send oil and up to 50 BRPs per turn to Russia: 20 BRPs via Murmansk (5 BRPs after the first full Axis offensive against Russia and rising each turn thereafter; Murmansk naval combat has been simplified), 10 BRPs via an Allied-controlled Turkey, 10 BRPs via Persia, and 10 BRPs via Alaska (halved if Japan is at war with Russia or controls Vladivostok or Dutch Harbor). The Persian and Alaskan routes each need 25 BRPs to open.
Research & Production.
Variants are gone altogether. All major powers except China receive Research Points (RPs) each year (including 1939) - both a basic allowance and extra for their BRP total and growth.
Overview.
Each faction (the European Axis going first then Allies, Russians and Japanese), may roll for one project in each category (air, naval, land, intelligence or atomic) each turn, provided it contains at least one friendly RP; as RPs expire with use, this means that a faction cannot roll twice for the same project in a single year. Research projects are rolled for by code-name; to increase the chances of steady research progress rather than a wildly lucky or unlucky result, the middle of three die rolls is taken, whilst in the Second Edition, under certain circumstances a poor result may be increased by reallocating unused RPs from another project in the same category. A player may also conduct "General Research" in a category, which may generate a positive modifier for all projects in that category. No more than half of a faction’s Research Points (RPs) may be put in a single category each year, and no more than 3 RPs (increased by 1 for each general research breakthrough in that category) in a single project.
Some results prevent further research in that area, whilst others generate a modifier for future research. Some must be announced to be effective (so atomic rockets or super-subs cannot be unleashed entirely without warning) and are normally implemented immediately, although some projects generate results which must be implemented a turn at a time (e.g. V1 flying bombs, then V2 rockets – the bases for these are secret installations, which may not be bombed or destroyed until revealed by espionage). In order to prevent the game being skewed by a wild result to the Battle of the Atlantic, there are restrictions on the numbers of RPs which may be placed in ASW, torpedo and submarine research early in the war, whilst players are also restricted as to how quickly they may begin atomic research.
Land, Sea and Air.
Research categories include CTL, winter preparation, German occupation policies in the Ukraine, heavy armour, the German National Redoubt in Berchtesgaden, torpedoes, submarines, harbour attacks, air DRM, air range (which affects submarine warfare), radar, bombers, synthetic oil, rockets and jets. Germany starts with a research advantage in jets and rockets, Japan in torpedoes, and the Allies in air range, strategic bombers and radar.
Intelligence.
Intelligence Research includes communist subversion of Balkan countries, which may cause a German reaction roll for the other potential targets. Pro-Axis Russian, Chinese and Indian units may be obtained by research but may not be rebuilt if lost (Indians may also be added for control of Indian and Burmese objectives). Moslem unrest may allow Germany to build partisans in Egypt (Wafdists) or the Middle East. Allied and Russian research may increase their partisan force pool for a region, up to the limit in the Minor Country force pool (Russia may build 2 partisans per turn, including in Eastern Poland, 1 of them for free).
Espionage allows each faction to place one spy ring in each research area for each enemy faction, where it reveals information about research projects and secret installations. A spy ring in a minor country reveals all enemy Diplomacy Points (DPs). Spy rings may be eliminated by an opposing spy ring. Germany, Britain and Russia (only) may conduct covert operations against a diplomatic target (so a faction should spread its DPs thinly to allow some presence in key countries) - to negate but not eliminate enemy DPs. Research may also negate an enemy covert operation, or reduce the effect of a harbour attack.
Britain and Germany (Ultra) and the USA and Japan (Magic) each have 8 codebreaking cards, and may get more by research. Each draws 4 cards per turn – a Magic draw also happens after war breaks out between the USA and Japan. Cards may give an advantage to: submarines, ASW, fleet combat, naval interception. Some are wild cards (US Magic only – may be used as any other) or blank. Some cards may be negated by the enemy playing an opposite one (ASW after submarines), or a similar one (fleet combat or naval interception).
Atomic.
Only Germany, the USA and Russia may research the atomic bomb, and this takes several stages, including controlled reaction and either plutonium production or uranium separation. Success creates a bomb 2-6 turns later, and another every 2 turns thereafter. An atomic bomb may be delivered by bomber, or by rocket or by a German submarine (for either of which a very high research result is needed). An atomic attack on an objective does at least 25 BRPs damage; under some circumstances tactical attacks, where the bomb is deemed to be used on the ground in a battle, may also be made.
Production.
Production (increasing a country’s forcepool by RPs) involves no luck, but the cost rises incrementally if several increments of the same thing are produced at once, reduced for each general research breakthrough in that area. Later in the game, as breakthroughs accumulate, force pool additions by production get larger. By late in the game, the Western Allies may have 25-30 RPs per year, enabling them to develop the atomic bomb, as well as increase their air DRM (which is affected by a favourable radar research result, giving the Allies a further advantage) and CTL and produce huge fleets of strategic bombers.
Diplomacy.
Diplomacy takes place in 1939 as well as in subsequent years. The USA receives extra DPs as US-Axis Tensions rise. Each country may allocate 1/3 (rounded up) of its DPs to a single target. Allies, European Axis and Russians (there is no diplomacy in the Pacific) may roll for a single country each turn, provided a friendly DP has been placed in it (a country can normally be named only once in a year) – in addition to activating one DP in US-Axis Tensions each turn (DPs may not be placed in Russo-German Tensions), and making reaction rolls for Norway, Spain (the Germans get a favourable modifier if the Allies attack Portugal), Vichy France and Balkan countries as appropriate. Russia may only allocate DPs to Balkan and other neighbouring countries.
A small random element has been added to US-Axis Tensions and US-Japanese Tensions (but not Russo-German Tensions) so it is harder to keep the USA neutral by “gaming” the table. Germany may declare war on the USA, as in reality, for free, gaining a two-turn “happy time” for her U-boats. Japan may declare war on the USA for free, but if so must pay to declare war on Britain (if she declares war on Britain alone this sharply accelerates USJT and US mobilisation). The USA may declare war on Japan for free, if allowed by US-Japanese Tensions - this puts Britain at war with Japan as well.
The minor country diplomatic tables have been standardised, with high numbers for pro-Axis results. Favourable results may gain the relevant major power BRPs, hex control (a limited number of the major power’s units may trace supply through and remain in the minor country), association (which also results from an attack by an enemy major power), or full activation as a minor ally. The controlling major power may now only rebuild 1 armour unit and 1 AAF each turn; minor allies and associated minors may rebuild a single infantry unit of up to 2 factors each turn for free, so the Rumanian army is harder to rebuild if lost in Russia. Minor countries may still switch sides by diplomatic roll, as Rumania did in 1944.
Iraqi and Persian forces (like those of Egypt) now consist of partisans rather than infantry, easing Britain's Middle Eastern defence burden somewhat.
Anybody may declare war on Belgium and Luxembourg, or Denmark and Norway, as single entities. Denmark no longer has any units, and is deemed to have surrendered at the start of the turn on which she is attacked, so the attacker (i.e. Germany) may place an airbase on her soil. Iron ore shipments from Sweden to Germany are disrupted if Sweden becomes anti-German, and are shipped via Norway in winter and spring (because of ice in the Baltic Sea) so are disrupted if the Allies control Bergen, or mine Norwegian waters - if done against Norway’s will this reduces US-Axis Tensions (i.e. making the USA less likely to join the Allies), increases future Norwegian rolls by 1, and allows Germany a reaction die roll. This disruption ends if Germany gains diplomatic or military control of Norway. Norway is also important for German atomic research. Finland may be a German diplomatic target at any time, even if no DPs have been placed there.
Country Notes.
Germany may not attack in the West or Mediterranean, nor declare war on minor countries, in Fall 1939, and must now pay for her opening offensive against Poland. However, the three pocket battleships, including the "Graf Spee", may start the game already at sea raiding and she gets an automatic harbour attack in Fall 1939 - the one which sank "HMS Royal Oak" in reality. The 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions are shown as separate units, giving more flexibility in North Africa. Germany starts the game with a 10 BRP economic interest in Russia, which ends when Russo-German Tensions reach 45; this does not affect the Russian BRP level. Germany surrenders if Berlin (or Berchtesgaden if the National Redoubt has been obtained by research) is occupied or under an atomic attack marker – not a firestorm - and her surrender level (her DP level less the number of firestorm and atomic attack markers, as well as -2 for the first atomic attack, -3 for the second, etc.) is less than zero, or else if all her hexes are Allied- or Russian-controlled or under an atomic attack marker. Germany now “wins” the game by surviving longer than in reality.
Italy may not enter the war in Fall 1939, or after the USA enters the war. She may only declare war on Greece, Yugoslavia and Vichy French colonies. Her forces – air, armour and infantry – are weaker than in previous versions. She may not grant BRPs to Germany, nor may Italian units be lent to Germany (so Italy must pay to use her small forces on the Eastern Front). Ethiopia, conquered by Italy in 1935-6, is shown as a mapboard box (worth 0 BRPs) containing Italian infantry at the start, and surrenders if it contains three times as many Allied factors as Axis. Italian surrender is more likely if Italy entered the war in 1941 or later, and less so if the Allies declared war on Italy; the Italian Surrender Level (ISL) determines whether Germany or the USA gain surface ships and (unbuilt) Italian infantry, and can be influenced by Allied DPs.
France has half as many air factors as before, and a few more infantry, and may surrender voluntarily after Fall 1940. The French Surrender Level (FSL) will be higher (i.e. a stronger Vichy and weaker Free France) the more French objectives Germany controls, the bigger the French fleet, or the earlier it happens, and is reduced for the size of the French army still on the map, or if Anglo-French co-operation is in effect. The British get a Free French infantry corps for each liberated French colony and a Free French armour corps after Paris has been liberated.
Britain’s armour corps now arrive late in the game (she has a few smaller ones earlier), and she is weaker in infantry – and, like Italy, is limited in the number of infantry units she may produce each year - but is required to build lots of strategic bombers. The Dominions and India have distinct counters. Unlike Canada or South Africa, Australia has her own UCL, and is restricted as to the forces which must be used in Australia, elsewhere in the Pacific, or sent to the Mediterranean or Ethiopia. Similar rules apply to India, where Britain must also deploy a garrison until Japan enters the war.
The USA starts at 100 BRPs, but when fully mobilised her base will be at least 700 BRPs, and probably nearer 1,000 BRPs when growth is included. The USA must keep naval forces in the Atlantic until at war with Germany. A “US election”, affecting both theatres, occurs after the 1945 YSS (i.e. the November 1944 Presidential Election, which in reality saw Roosevelt comfortably re-elected, but which might have seen the USA call off an unpopular or inconclusive war). An “election”, representing a Congressional review of foreign policy and possibly only affecting the European theatre, also occurs after an atomic attack on the USA (which may cause the USA to drop out altogether, or may galvanise US opinion and lift all restrictions on US participation), or a British or Russian surrender.
For her opening attack Japan may send a special taskforce to attack air and naval units in Pearl Harbor; a second strike (with the option of hitting the oil reserves), will have no surprise and runs the risk of interception. Japanese surrender is now more likely if her cities have been firestormed or if she has many unbuilt units, possibly as her UCL has been reduced by oil shortage. A Russo-Japanese Tension table was abandoned during development. Russia may cut her Manchurian garrison (the old “Siberian” reinforcements of the winter of 1941-2) if Japan reduces hers, if Germany is at war with Russia or if the USA imposes an oil embargo on Japan. Russia may declare war on Japan if her garrison BRP value is twice that of Japan, if Japan's is less than 30 BRPs or Germany has surrendered.
A Russo-German Tension Table has replaced Russian Reaction rolls. German aggression in the west and penetration of minor countries bordering Russia increase RGT. Russia may now occupy Eastern Poland without a declaration of war. Finnish and Rumanian resistance to border demands is now determined by a die roll, so Russia should demand Bessarabia early in 1940 before tensions are too high. Higher RGT allow Russia to subvert Balkan countries, to declare war on bordering minor countries (if Germany has an economic interest she may require Russia to declare war on Germany or else back down and lose her interest), then stop sending oil, and ultimately declare war on Germany.
Like US-Axis and US-Japanese tensions, Russo-German tensions allow a window for the historical surprise Axis attack. Russia is required to deploy the bulk of her ground and air forces within four hexes of the border, making their destruction more likely. During the initial surprise attack their movement allowance is reduced, armoured zones of control inflict less restriction on the Germans and infantry attacked by German armour fights at -1 DM (i.e. at face value in clear terrain), whilst the air force fights at -1 DRM. The ground warfare restrictions do not apply to Russian units in the Finnish and Romanian border hexes, encouraging the Germans to make their main attack from Poland.
Russia’s base grows by a percentage equal to the level of RGT (50% once at war) each year. Russia adds ICs from mobilisation and may add more by production - a new IC may be added as a Urals oil centre. ICs may not be redeployed, but Russia may destroy 1 per turn (not the ones in Moscow, Leningrad or Stalingrad), gaining 2 RPs towards the cost of producing the next one. They can be used for supply, losing 5 BRPs per turn until eliminated. The late-war Russians are stronger than ever before, with ICs rising to a value of 25 BRPs (provided Germany attacked Russia), extra air factors and Guards Tank Armies as strong as US or SS armoured corps; the second edition allows Russian infantry "Shock" Armies to overstack.
Scenarios.
Several small scenarios are provided: North Africa, the Battle of the Atlantic & Barbarossa in Europe; in the Pacific Coral Sea, Midway and Leyte are as before, although Pearl Harbor has gone. Further Pacific scenarios (Guadalcanal, Singapore, Imphal & Cartwheel) are available on the game’s website, as is a 1941 scenario and scenarios for the Eastern Front after 1942, and the Spanish Civil War. Europe or the Pacific may be played separately (Allied BRPs are assumed to be infinite in Pacific-only scenarios) or linked to form Global War; any of these may be played with the historical countermix or with research and production. The scenarios starting in 1940, 1942 and 1944 have been dropped.

Harbor tug USS "YT-129" was launched by the Charleston Navy Yard on 3 March 1938 and commissioned on 1 June 1938. She was assigned the name USS "Osceola" (YT-129) on 17 September 1938.
"Osceola" reported to the 14th Naval District, headquartered at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She was stationed at Pearl Harbor throughout World War II, providing assistance in maneuvering larger ships, rendered towing service for naval vessels, and aiding in waterfront firefighting. She was reclassified as a large harbor tug (YTB–129) on 12 April 1944 and was damaged during the West Loch Disaster of 21 May 1944.
After World War II, Osceola continued to provide her vital service to the United States Pacific Fleet. Her classification changed to medium harbor tug (YTM–129) in early 1962.
"Osceola" was sold for scrapping by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) on 1 February 1973.

Gomez-Perez v. Potter

Gomez-Perez v. Potter, 553 U.S. 474 (2008), was a United States Supreme Court case holding that federal employees can assert claims for retaliation resulting from filing an age discrimination complaint. The case continued the Court's long-standing position that cause for action following retaliation can be inferred in civil rights legislation, even though the law does not explicitly provide protection against victimization.
The case is important because it signaled a willingness by recently appointed Justice Samuel Alito to continue the Court's expansive interpretation of civil rights laws.
Facts.
Myrna Gómez-Pérez worked for the United States Postal Service as a part-time window distribution clerk in Puerto Rico.
Ms. Gómez-Pérez sought a transfer to a full-time position; however, her supervisor denied her request. Ms. Gómez-Pérez alleged that the supervisor denied the request based on her age and filed an EEO complaint on the basis of age discrimination.
Subsequently Ms. Gómez-Pérez alleged that, as a result of filing her complaint, in retaliation she was subjected to a series of reprisals that included groundless charges of sexual harassment, substantial reductions in her hours, and being harassed and mocked by her co-workers. As a result, she filed a retaliation complaint.
Judgment.
The Supreme Court held that federal employees can assert claims for retaliation resulting from filing an age discrimination complaint. Even though it is not explicitly in the Civil Rights Act, the existence of the right can be inferred from the Act's scheme, as necessary to make the rights effective.

Bert Bolle Barometer

The Bert Bolle Barometer is a large water barometer. At over 12.5 metres tall, it is recognized as the largest barometer in the world by The International Guinness Book of Records. The instrument was created in 1985 in the Netherlands; in 2007 it was reinstalled in the new Visitor Centre of Denmark, Western Australia and was removed from there in 2011.
History.
The Netherlands.
The Dutch writer and barometer specialist Bert Bolle (born 1947) designed and built the water barometer in 1985 as the focal point of the Barometer Museum, which he ran with his wife Ethne in the 18th-century country house ‘Rustenhoven’ at Maartensdijk in central Netherlands. In 1978 Bolle wrote a book titled "Barometers", which was translated into German and English. In 1983 he wrote a scientific sequel to his first book and developed some modifications of the mercury barometer system. 
In 1985 Bolle and his wife set up a barometer museum in their country house. Their aim was to create a collection based on loans of barometers from private collectors and museums in the Netherlands. To obtain these loans, a massive publicity campaign was undertaken. Bolle wanted something to make the museum's launch spectacular, an appliance that would be impressive and definitive which would serve as the centre point of the Barometer Museum. He decided to design and make a water barometer, paying homage to the 17th-century scientists, such as Evangelista Torricelli and Gasparo Berti, who produced some of the first and most crucial vacuum experiments, and created the first water barometers alongside their houses between 1640 and 1660. Bolle's old three-story country house had ample height, the highest point of which was the roof of the main hall: a leaded glass cupola. The apex of the hall was over 12 metres from the hall floor; a perfect environment for such an enormous instrument.
Bolle decided to make a construction of four borosilicate glass (e.g. Pyrex) pipes of 90 mm diameter. He fitted the pipes to a nine-metre-long solid oak plank, which was one metre wide at the base. For the top three metres of the barometer, a 25 mm thick polymethylmethacrylate (e.g. Perspex) sheet was used. The reservoir chamber was also made of borosilicate glass; with a diameter of 600 mm the capacity of this reservoir was enough to hold 150 litres of water, which was necessary to make the barometer work properly. The first successful test runs took place in November and December 1985.
Bolle designed the top end of the water barometer to be connected to a rotary vane pump, which was governed by timer relays. At ten-minute intervals, the pump evacuated the air from the glass pipe, causing the 12-metre-tall instrument to fill with 55 litres of water within one minute. Visitors were invited to climb the stairs and follow the water to the top, where it started to boil spontaneously (see below). The huge register plate had two scales: centimeters of water and millibar. Water vapour pressure depresses the reading of water barometers, and the magnitude of this error increases with temperature. Thus, a rule of thumb was provided to make a correction for temperature. After a reading period of five minutes, air was admitted to the top area of the pipe. Within a couple of minutes all the water would return to the cistern downstairs, after which the ten-minute pump cycle would start again. Visitors were able to watch a real living instrument the whole day.
The instrument proved to be a massive drawcard and appeared several times in the media during the subsequent twelve-year period during which Bolle's Barometer Museum operated. In 1998 the museum was closed down.
Australia.
Bolle and his wife migrated to Australia in 1999, but the maker didn’t want to part with his creation, so the barometer was brought with them to Australia, where Bolle donated it to the community of Denmark, a small town in Western Australia. The town didn’t have a building high enough to house the enormous instrument, but in 2004 plans were adopted for a new multi-function Visitors Centre, the centre part of which would be The Barometer Tower, built especially for the instrument. 
The Shire of Denmark made the water barometer a local monument, named The Bert Bolle Barometer. Furthermore the shire announced that the tower would be dedicated to the water barometer and the history of weather instruments in general and access would be free of charge. In 2007 the Denmark Visitor Centre was finished. It was officially opened on 10 August by the Minister for Tourism in Western Australia Mrs Sheila McHale.
In the Barometer Tower the Bert Bolle Barometer stood on a stainless steel pedestal. The vacuum pump cycle became shorter than it was in the Netherlands; reduced to six minutes from the previous ten. The timer relays had been replaced by a PLC, which now governs a refined and modernized vacuum system with 11 solenoid valves. Operating eight hours per day, seven days a week, the water barometer was constantly ‘on the move’. 
Visitors could walk up the stairs and take a reading in the Reading Room atop the Tower.
At the moment when the water reached its highest possible point in the glass pipe, visitors could witness an interesting physical phenomenon for about a minute. The air pressure above the water had lowered dramatically. Therefore the evaporation of the water happened so vigorously that the water started to boil spontaneously, although its temperature rarely exceeded 20 °C. This ‘cold boiling’ is contributed to by air bubbles that were formed in the water column. 
As soon as the pump was disconnected, the evacuating of the pipe stopped and the water level became calm again, enabling people to take a reading. During the time the water level was calm, there was still some turbulence at the surface due to air bubbles rising to the top of the apparatus. 
Although water vapour pressure depressed the barometers pressure reading, visitors were told how to correct for this error and thus calculate the real air pressure, and could then compare it with the accurate Vaisala digital standard barometer in the Tower.
After a reading period of two minutes, air was gradually admitted to the vacuum in the top area of the pipe. Within another two minutes all the water had returned to the reservoir downstairs, after which the six-minute pump cycle of the Bert Bolle Barometer repeated.
Climbing the stairs in the tower, a selection of antique barometers from Europe was displayed, along with five murals depicting the oldest barometer experiments dating from the 17th century.
In the Reading Room, tribute was paid to the pioneers of the barometer, the Italian scientists Galileo Galilei and Evangelista Torricelli. 
On the ground floor, Bolle had created several interesting physical experiments such as the Atmosphere Simulator, in which artificial highs and lows were created. There was also a bell jar showing interesting vacuum experiments with sound and air.
Record.
Australia is known as a country of bizarre records for the sake of tourism, like the Big Banana or the Giant Ram. The size of the water barometer in Denmark was, however, a result of necessity, rather than a tourist gimmick. In order to function properly, a water barometer has to be quite large, with greater height producing greater accuracy. The Bert Bolle Barometer is thus a very accurate and genuine working instrument, as well as an impressive monument. 
Recognition.
In April 2008 the Bert Bolle Barometer was listed among the Top Hundred Australian ‘must see’ topics. Australian Traveller magazine revealed a list of 100 Things You Can Only Do In Australia. During its first year of its existence, the Denmark Visitor Centre recorded its 100,000th visitor.
25th anniversary.
In December 2010 the 25th anniversary of the barometer was celebrated. Bolle had written a booklet titled "Weird and Wonderful Weather Predictors", of which 1,000 copies were printed and given to visitors in December as a present.
The loss of the barometer.
Shortly after the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Bert Bolle Barometer the Denmark Visitor Centre lost its world attraction. Differences of opinion with the Board of Denmark Tourism Incorporated and the management of the Denmark Visitor Centre about promoting and signposting the water barometer and the Barometer Tower at the Denmark Visitor Centre lay at the bottom of an ongoing conflict. Eventually Bolle and his wife asked Denmark Council for the barometer to be given back to them, which was unanimously approved on 21 December 2010. The Barometer Tower was dismantled mid February 2011.
New location.
Negotiations with a possible future owner of the barometer are in an advanced phase, albeit the location will not be in Denmark anymore. The plan is to house the water barometer in a 6x6 m brick tower with a small meteorological museum attached.
Copy.
The Otto von Guericke Museum in Magdeburg in Germany erected a copy of the water barometer in 1995, after Bolle had been asked for his expertise. The barometer was situated in the centre of a spiral staircase. No attempt was made to outdo Bolle’s record. A narrower pipe was used, made of polycarbonate and the instrument was named the ‘Bert Bolle Wasserbarometer’ after the Dutch record holder.
Labour-intensive.
Maintenance is an ongoing concern for the barometer, with one of the major issues being water vapour, which constantly enters the pump and could easily emulsify with the pump oil. Special provisions are made to prevent this. Since water vapour is extracted continuously, the water level in the reservoir needs to be topped up every day. In addition, the abundance of sunshine in the barometer's environment, combined with the presence of algae in the rainwater that is employed, leads to a risk of algae growing within the water pipe. To address this, the owners have employed chlorine to kill the algae, but the evaporation of the chlorine had to be specifically catered for. Wear and tear also places considerable strain on the vacuum system's vulnerable pump, its 11 solenoid valves and its relays. Finally, the barometer needs to be exclusively filled with pure rainwater, as tap water contains many minerals which may be detrimental to the barometer.
Because the water barometer has always been treated with great care, the instrument still looks almost new despite its age. A well-considered choice of durable materials like oak and borosilicate glass certainly play an important role in its continued longevity. Other attempts to copy the instrument have floundered due to the use of inferior material, a lack of constant supervision, pollution of the pipe system and other factors reducing durability.

The War of the Messiah

The War of the Messiah is a series of Dead Sea scroll fragments describing the conclusion of a battle led by the Leader of the Congregation. The fragments that make up this document include , also known as The Pierced Messiah Text, and 11Q14 with which it was found to coincide. It is possible that it also represents the conclusion of the War Scroll, as the two read coherently and discuss related thematic issues.
The Pierced Messiah Text (4Q285).
This six-line fragment, commonly referred to as the "Pierced Messiah" text, is written in a Herodian script of the first half of the 1st Century and refers to the "stump of Jesse"—the Messiah—from the Branch of David, to a judgement, killing, and cleansing of the land of the dead by the Messiah's soldiers.
Translation from Hebrew.
Hebrew is primarily made up of consonants; vowels must be supplied by the reader. The appropriate vowels depend on the context. Thus, the text (line 4) may be translated as "and the Prince of the Congregation, the Branch of David, will kill him," or alternately read as "and they killed the Prince." Because of the second reading, the text was dubbed the "Pierced Messiah." The transcription and translation presented here support the "killing Messiah" interpretation, alluding to a triumphant Messiah ().
The Pierced Messiah Controversy.
In September 1992, "Time Magazine" published an article on the War Rule fragment displayed here (object no. 12) exploring the differing interpretations. A "piercing messiah" reading would support the traditional Jewish view of a triumphant messiah. If, on the other hand, the fragment were interpreted as speaking of a "pierced messiah," it would anticipate the New Testament view of the preordained death of the messiah. The scholarly basis for these differing interpretations—but not their theological ramifications—are reviewed in "A Pierced or Piercing Messiah?"
Two Different Readings.
There are two possible readings of the war scrolls, with most scholars agreeing on the former as the most logical, as it parallels with the War Scroll and other Dead Sea Scrolls.

Terminology.
11Q14 describes a Leader of the Congregation, that is, a messianic figure known from other Dead Sea Scrolls. References to Kittim refer to an opposing force, and scholars agree that it most likely refers to the Romans. The stump of Jesse and Branch of David in Frag. 1 Col. 1 refer to the coming of a Messiah from the line of King David.

The Pride of the South

The Pride of the South is the name of the marching band at The University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi. The full band plays at all Ole Miss home football games, and a smaller pep band is sent to most away games. The full band also travels to Ole Miss bowl games and Starkville, Mississippi when Mississippi State University hosts the Egg Bowl.The University of Mississippi Band has been giving outstanding performances in concert and in support of Ole Miss athletic events since it was organized in 1928.

He originally served in the British civil service and was posted to the Hong Kong Government in 1971. In Hong Kong, he was the first to hold the post of Secretary for Economic Services under the reform in 1973 and had served as Secretary for the Environment, Secretary for Transport and Official Legislative Councillor before he was posted to Brussels serving as Minister for Hong Kong Relations with European Community and Member States in 1982. He subsequently retired from the government in 1986.
Early life.

Claudius W. Sears

Claudius Wistar Sears (November 8, 1817 – February 15, 1891) was an United States Army officer, an educator, and a Confederate general during the American Civil War. 
During the war, Sears was part of the Confederate garrison that was captured following the Siege of Vicksburg in 1863, and would be wounded twice in combat. After the conflict he returned to teaching.
Early life and career.
Claudius Sears was born in the city of Peru located in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. He attended the United States Military Academy in West Point in July 1837, and graduated four years later, standing 31st out of 52 cadets. Despite his Massachusetts birth, Sears would receive his appointment to West Point from the state of New York. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 8th U.S. Infantry on July 1, 1841. Sears and the 8th Infantry fought in Florida during the Seminole Wars until the fall of 1842.
Sears resigned his commission from the U.S. Army on October, 10, 1842. Following a short stint teaching at St. Thomas's Hall at Holly Springs in Marshall County, Mississippi, he moved to Louisiana and was the professor of mathematics at the University of Louisiana (known now as Tulane) in New Orleans from 1845 to 1859. Sears then was a professor at Louisiana University from 1859 into 1860, teaching both math as well as physics. He returned to St. Thomas's Hall in 1860 to serve as its president until 1861.
Civil War service.
At the start of the American Civil War in 1861, Sears chose to follow the Confederate cause and enlisted in the 17th Mississippi Infantry Regiment that May, and elected captain of its Company G soon afterward. Sears and the 17th Infantry fought at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21 and at the Battle of Ball's Bluff on October 21, and participated during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign engagements of Yorktown, Seven Pines, and the Seven Days Battles. Sears fought at the Battle of Antietam during the Maryland Campaign on September 17.
On December 11, 1862, Sears was appointed colonel of the 46th Mississippi Infantry, and began his Western Theater service. With his new regiment, Sears participated during the Vicksburg Campaign of late 1862 and summer of 1863. He fought at Battle of Chickasaw Bayou on December 29, 1862, and the Battle of Port Gibson on May 1, 1863, but during the fighting at the Battle of Champion Hill his regiment was held in reserve.
In the spring and summer of 1863, Sears and his command were part of the Army of Mississippi, led by Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton and defending the Confederate stronghold at Vicksburg guarding the Mississippi River. Following the six week long siege of the garrison and its surrender on July 4, Sears was captured by Union forces, and was exchanged that fall. Sears' brigade commander, William E. Baldwin, praised his performance at Vicksburg, saying: 
After being exchanged in October 1863, Sears was returned to his command in early 1864 following several months on parole. On March 1 he was promoted to brigadier general and ordered to join the Army of Tennessee. On April 1 his brigade was added to Maj. Gen. Samuel G. French's Division, and Sears arrived with his command that May at Resaca, Georgia. He fought during the Atlanta Campaign in the summer of 1864, and was wounded during the Battle of Adairsville near Cassville, Georgia, on May 19. 
Sears next participated in the late 1864 Franklin-Nashville Campaign, taking part in the Battle of Allatoona on October 5, the Battle of Franklin on November 30, and the Battle of Nashville on December 15, where Sears was severely wounded. During the fight, a cannonball killed hid horse and one of Sears' legs was shot off. He was removed for care to the rear areas of the Army of Tennessee as it retreated, but was left behind and captured on December 21 at Pulaski, Tennessee. Sears was paroled from Nashville, Tennessee on June 23, 1865.
Postbellum.
After the war, Sears returned to Mississippi and taught mathematics & civil engineering at the University of Mississippi from 1865 to 1889. He died two years later at Oxford in Lafayette County, Mississippi, and is buried there in the city's Saint Peter's Cemetery.

James Rupert Miller

James Rupert Miller (June 27, 1869 – August 23, 1946) was an architect active in San Francisco, California in the first half of the 20th century. Miller gained prominence after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake when his firm was one among many called upon to rebuild the stricken city.
After serving apprentice and draftsman to several prominent San Francisco architects in the late 19th century, Miller formed his own firm in 1902. Miller joined two prestigious social clubs: the Corinthian Yacht Club of Tiburon and The Family. In 1906, Miller partnered with George T. De Colmesnil to better tackle the many reconstruction tasks at hand. Miller and Colmesnil designed the Corinthian Yacht Club's Colonial Revival clubhouse in 1912. Together, they rebuilt the City of Paris department store in 1909.
Miller and Colmesnil hired teenaged Timothy L. Pflueger in 1907 to help as a draftsman in the office. Miller saw promise in Pflueger and gave him his first assignment: Our Lady of the Wayside Church in 1912. Colmesnil left the partnership in 1913.
Miller continued on his own, with Pflueger on staff. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company became an important client, with near-continuous expansion of their Neoclassic 600 Stockton Street location in San Francisco from 1914 through 1919 (the building now houses a Ritz-Carlton hotel.) In 1923, after working full-time on the Castro Theatre project, Pflueger was given full partnership with Miller.
Miller moved to Burlingame in the 1920s with his wife Florence G. Miller. Miller retired in 1937 at age 68.

James C. Donnell (April 20, 1854 - January 10, 1927) was an American industrialist. He was the president of The Ohio Oil Company from 1911 until his death in 1927.
Early life and career.
James C. Donnell was born on April 20, 1854, in County Armagh, Ireland, to James Donnell and Elizabeth Doyle. At the age of two, Donnell and his family moved to the United States and settled in Waterford, Pennsylvania. At the age of eighteen, he began his career in the oil industry by hauling crude oil from a refinery in Titusville, Pennsylvania. When the Bradford Oil Field opened in 1874, Donnell went into business for himself, gaining leases at Red Rock and Dallas City, Pennsylvania. He went on to gain further leases in Allentown and Bolivar, New York.

<doc id="20036645" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20036645" title="The Boxing Lesson">
The Boxing Lesson

The Boxing Lesson is a rock band from Austin, TX. A power trio with synthesizers performing the bass player's role, they create a mammoth psychedelic 'wall of sound' that begins minimally and builds into grand orchestrations. Vocalist and guitarist Paul Waclawsky and synthesizer player Jaylinn Davidson combine strong songwriting with desert rock, guitar freak-outs, soul space jams and plenty of Texas rock ’n’ roll thunder. 
The Boxing Lesson EP.
The Boxing Lesson was formed in Los Angeles by Paul Waclawsky in 2002, where they recorded and released their first two EPs on their own label, Send Me Your Head Records. The first, self-titled effort gained strong local buzz and earned the band many shows supporting touring national bands. The EP was described by the LA Weekly as one that "tests your patience and then rewards it." Joseph Kyle from MundaneSounds wrote that, "The promise on The Boxing Lesson is so great, that you'd probably want to hold them to their potential in a court of law." Some international acclaim was received as well. Noise Theory Australia gave it 5-stars, and wrote that, "Each of the four tracks on this debut self-titled EP gracefully drift through the dark night, and with every intricate guitar melody there is a star that lights the way," and "The Boxing Lesson have addressed every issue that has ever plagued atmospheric rock and mended them in what seems like a manner that seems to simple to be true."
Radiation.
The band quickly recorded a follow up with Matt Brown and Chris Pearson at Sonikwire Studios in Irvine, CA. Expanding on the sound of the debut EP, the band incorporated more Moog synthesizers, ambient effects and a new bass player. The EP also included a woozy live version of the Acetone song, "Don't Cry", that was recorded at Reservoir Tip Studios by Anthony Arvizu. ""Radiation"", received more impressive national and international reviews, with "Splendid Magazine" describing it as "promising, if imperfect". Australian blog, Halo-17, gave the record a favorable 8.5/10 rating and said,"If you only take a chance on one new rock album this month, make it this one," and "The Boxing Lesson cut all the fat from their music, and produced a record which shows that they're a band that should be taken seriously, in addition to providing some of the best music I've heard so far in 2004."
Songs in the Key of C.
In late-2004, Waclawsky relocated from California to Texas, where he assembled a new lineup including Jaylinn Davidson on synthesizers and Jake Mitchell on drums. Practicing and writing songs for a full year before playing live, the band recorded ""Songs in the Key of C"" with Tim Gerron at Music Lab in Austin, TX. The sound was a wild departure from the two previous EPs. The Onion's Los Angeles Calendar Section wrote, "Gone are the laid-back vocals and gauzy guitars, replaced by passionate singing, frenzied power chords, and tons of gurgling analog synthesizers." The Austin Chronicle gave the release 3 stars and wrote, "Though claiming "Indie Rock Is Dead," the Boxing Lesson's Songs in the Key of C provides enough lo-fi life support in its tales of criminals and crackheads to stay the reaper." Meanwhile, Smother Magazine wrote, "The Boxing Lesson are an indie rock band on a mission to the moon."
Wild Streaks & Windy Days.
After doing several tours promoting ""Songs in the Key of C"", the band quickly went back to Tim Gerron in 2007 to record their debut full length album. Focusing on more atmospheric textures and varied styles of songwriting, the 12-song album, "Wild Streaks & Windy Days", took 8 months to record and was eventually self-released at SXSW 2008 to positive reviews. Barrett King of Baltimore's Sën magazine compared the sound of the album to that of other space rock acts like Pink Floyd and David Bowie, while LA Cityzine praised its "rich lyrical offerings and strong musicianship". The Lemur Blog in Sweden wrote, ""The result is spaced out, it's probably the best space rock album you can find within the scrutinized confines of 2008.". The Music Reviewer gave the album a 9.0/10 and said, "It's an amazing mix of the past and the present, without being too much of either. It's a group that you'll hear more of in the future, and it's a group that knows how to pay homage to – and not just copy – their idols from the past." Indiecision blog from India described The Boxing Lesson's sound as, "if Failure and Pink Floyd got together to drink mushroom tea out of fancy little teacups and chase the white rabbit with Brian Eno and Robert Smith".
The band released a music video for "Dark Side of the Moog" from "Wild Streaks and Windy Days", directed by Eric Power, which features an animated version of the band exploring an alien planet. A stop motion music video for the track "Brighter' was released as well. The video, directed by Victor Yiu, was constructed from over 6000 still images. Additionally, the band released a guerrilla-cam-style video for "Dance with Meow" shot by Matt Robertson which featured the band dressed in furry cat masks, chasing the White Rabbit, doing cat-nip and visiting local-haunts in Austin's nightlife.
Jake Mitchell.
In August 2008, the band's drummer, Jake Mitchell, was sentenced to five years of prison after being charged by the Austin police for "conspiracy to manufacture marijuana". Before Mitchell went to prison, the band went into the studio to record a number of tracks that could become the foundation of a new EP.
On February 14, 2009, Daytrotter posted a session recorded live in Rock Island, IL, featuring an unreleased song, "Room 17," that was written as a tribute to Mitchell.
Fur State.
On October 26, 2010, The Boxing Lesson released "Fur State," a lo-fi acoustic/electronic instrumental album recorded on a 4-track by Waclawsky and Davidson in 2004. The album heavily features synthesizers and drum loops and marks a turning point in the evolution of the band. The album name is a play on words for the "first eight" songs recorded in Austin. Self-released on homemade cassette tapes, the album cover depicts the State of Texas in a tiger fur pattern. Some of these songs are instrumental stripped down versions of songs that appeared on "Songs in the Key of C" and "Wild Streaks & Windy Days". Cassette restoration and Mastering by Danny Reisch at Good Danny's, Austin, TX.
An animated music video by Jeanne Hospod was released for the opening track, "One". It features a ghost-rodeo, space-travel, feminine beauty, psychedelic felines, art and enlightenment from the far reaches of Austin, TX. Hospod released an erotic animated video for the track "Four" in early 2011. The artist's description was, "Alien woman seduces hapless human male involving a very unusual flower." Nathan Guy directed a non-animated cat-themed video for the track "Three" that was released at SXSW 2011. The director described the video as "Morphing cats' psychedelic journey through the Fur State," and video blended live performance shots with warped smoky images showing the band in costume hanging at local Austin haunts.
Muerta EP.
The Boxing Lesson released a collection of four slow-tempo psychedelic tracks entitled "Muerta EP" in the summer of 2011. These songs were recorded over several years in Austin, TX with several drummers. These four recordings chronicle the band's evolution during this time period and are an expansion of their space rock sound. Vivogig reviewer Jim Sells says, "Well, the Boxing Lesson nails it on “Muerta.” Pink Floyd influences the music but there is more to their sound than a Floyd fixation. Elements of M83, the “Northern Soul”-period of The Verve, and the adventurousness of Ponytail all are present here. The effects-laden guitar weaves in and out of the soaring Moog parts, creating a sonic landscape that draws the listener in from the first sound. Sells goes on to note that "“Muerta” has to be in my Top 10 for the year. There is just nothing like it out there." A double 7inch vinyl set was pressed by New Fortune Records. The Muerta music video directed by Jonathan London and animated by Will Kistler was also released. The CGI enhanced video depicts the band drowning to the depths of the sea.
Health is the New Drug b/w Better Daze.
"Health is the New Drug" was released as a single along with b-side "Better Daze" in February 2012. New Fortune Records, a Detroit imprint, pressed a vinyl single. It's the first track being released from the upcoming Big Hits LP produced by Chris "Frenchie" Smith (Trail of Dead, Meat Puppets, Ume). The song features psychedelic guitar riffs, a wall of synthesizers, and a few words of wisdom (or caution). "Relying on MOOG for bottom end and tons of sonic noise, the songs blend Meddle-era Floyd guitar freak-outs with M83 propulsion, Spiritualized soul space jams with Texas rock ’n’ roll thunder." High praise came from the Houston Press who said, "Seriously, "Health is the New Drug" is the best song we've heard this year." An animated music video for Better Daze was released at the end of 2012. The video depicts a meteor filled with dark life forms plummeting into Earth releasing bizarre creatures on Austin, TX. Directed by Eric Power the video combines live action with cut paper shadow animation filmed on a green screen. Houston Press ranked Better Daze number 15 in their Top 25 music videos of 2012.
Big Hits!
Big Hits! is the first full-length album released by The Boxing Lesson in five years. It's more rock-oriented than The Boxing Lesson's past albums and is produced by Chris "Frenchie" Smith (...And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead, The Darkness, Dandy Warhols, Ringo Deathstarr) at The Bubble in Austin, TX. Big Hits! was released at SXSW 2013 to positive reviews. The Austin Chronicle gave it 3 ½ stars and said, “Arms buried deep in galactic mud, the Boxing Lesson takes an outer space journey to the center of the Earth.” 
Making this new album was no easy fight for the Boxing Lesson. When Paul Waclawsky and keyboardist Jaylinn Davidson began writing the band's second LP four punishing years ago, they planned to name it Possibilities. Only after enduring a long and merciless beatdown of bad luck and creative interruptions did they come to curse that title. The album was mixed by Kevin Butler at Test Tube Audio, and mastered off analog tape by Jerry Tubb at Terra Nova in Austin, TX. The results brought the project to completion, except for the album name. Utilizing a clever triple entendre, they renamed it Big Hits! and emerged with a 12th round knockout. 
Musical style.
The band's sound primarily is built around a psychedelic space rock ethos, with Paul Waclawsky's dark melodic guitar work using reverb, fuzz, and tape delay effects, and Jaylinn Davidson's heavy use of Moog synthesizers. The band has not had a stringed bass player since relocating to Austin, the rhythmic function of the bassline is instead performed on the synth. Haunting vocals and moody melodies are punctuated by mesmerizing guitars, droney beats and expressive electronica. The Boxing Lesson plays "space" rock that can transport the listener to another dimension and beyond. Culturespill blog said, "An up-and-coming threesome out of Austin, Texas, The Boxing Lesson betray a rather thinly veiled affinity for Pink Floyd but they roughen the edges of that influence with an open-armed embrace of Spacemen 3, The Cure, Radiohead and Broken Social Scene. Craig Franklin from Halo-17 Australia wrote, "Not enough bands make music like The Boxing Lesson any more. Over the course of three EPs, they've managed to create some truly breathtaking and epic music that draw the dots between such seemingly disparate bands as Pink Floyd, My Bloody Valentine and David Bowie. They're equally at home writing short, concise pop songs, and kicking out the jams. They use a Moog synth extensively. In short, unlike a lot of bands, they're consistently "interesting".

Mahaffey Camp

Mahaffey Camp is a Christian camp and conference center affiliated with the Christian and Missionary Alliance denomination. Mahaffey Camp is a member of the Christian Camp and Conference Association (CCCA).
Mission statement.
The purpose of Mahaffey Camp and Conference Center is to serve as a Christian Center to evangelize, disciple and provide fellowship for individuals of all ages to the glory of God. This is to be accomplished by developing a year round program that would maintain the present family camp, and include such other possibilities as retreats, conferences, children and youth camps, vacationing for our constituents, and such other activities as would serve the best interest of our district family and the worldwide ministry of The Christian and Missionary Alliance. 
History.
Mahaffey Camp had its beginning in 1894 when Rev. William Bryenton, a Methodist minister, along with several others, chose a beautiful pine grove close to the boro of Mahaffey, PA to hold a camp meeting. So successful was the 1894 camp meeting that Bryenton and his congregation determined to repeat the event the next summer. When the time arrived, food vendors as well as some folks selling liquor made their way to the site. Disapproving of alcohol, Bryenton and James Stephenson had a time of prayer and began a search for an alternate site. Mr. Stephenson owned a tract of land one mile down the Susquehanna River. It proved to be an ideal location. Everything they needed was there, including the right to control those who had access to the grounds during the camp meetings. On November 29, 1895, Stephenson deeded the land to the Susquehanna Park Holiness Camp Meeting Association with the provision that it always be used for a holiness camp meeting. 
In 1913 the annual gathering of the Susquehanna Park Holiness Camp Meeting Association came under the control of The Christian and Missionary Alliance and its long name was shortened to Mahaffey Camp. In its 100+ years, Mahaffey-goers have listened to a list of Bible teachers. These have included most of the presidents of The C&MA, a generous sprinkling of college administrators and faculty, and a long list of other notables. The missionary voices have literally encompassed the world in their representation. The roster of names is a who's who in Alliance missions spanning the past century. 
Although no record has been kept of those at Mahaffey Camp who have received Christ as Saviour or dedicated their lives to full-time Christian service, the stories of spiritual victory at camp are legion. Many of those who made decisions did so as children. They were taken to Mahaffey Camp by concerned parents, pastors, or friends. Today, Mahaffey Camp is the second largest gathering of pastors, Christian workers, and lay people in the denomination of The Christian and Missionary Alliance, surpassed only by the church-wide General Council. 
In 1992, Mahaffey Camp of The C&MA was incorporated as a non-profit organization. Its directorship was changed from that of the assistant superintendent of the Western PA District of the C&MA to a full-time Director/Developer. 
Facilities.
The Mahaffey Camp and Conference facilities are rustic, set in the Western Pa foothills, surrounded by beautiful hills. Over 200 privately owned cottages, three dormitories (dorm numbers 2, 4, & 5 are still in use), two longhouses, many chalets, and three RV trailer and tent areas comprise the accommodations for Family Camp in July. 
There are two main tabernacles for church services. The Main Tabernacle houses all adult services and the Youth Tabernacle houses all youth services and Y.E.S. events (Youth Extra Service). The Dining Hall serves three meals daily during Family Camp and is air-conditioned. Sandwiches, snacks and limited grocery items are available at the Camp Store(During Family and Applefest only). 
The campground continues to upgrade its facilities as funds are available.
Activities.
Through the Year many activities will take place on the campgrounds, most of these take place inside the Dining Hall, though things like the "Applefest" takes place throughout the camp.
Here are a few of the activities that take place:
Summer camps.
Family Camp
Youth Camps

Populus grandidentata

Populus grandidentata, commonly called large-tooth, big-tooth, American aspen, white poplar, or several other names, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.
Name.
The name "Populus" is from the Latin for poplar, and "grandidentata" refers to the coarse teeth on the leaves ("grandi" meaning large, and "dentata" meaning toothed).
Description.
"Populus grandidentata" is a medium-sized deciduous tree native to North America, found mostly in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Leaves are similar to "Populus tremuloides", but slightly larger and having larger teeth. The leaves tremble in the wind as "P. tremuloides" does. Bark of younger trees is olive-green, thin and smooth; after 30–40 years, the bark is grey, thick and rough with grooves.
Reproduction.
Bigtooth aspens produce seeds from the flower clusters, known as catkins. The seed, a two-valved capsule, is distributed widely by the wind. Individuals can also reproduce through the roots after a disturbance event, such as fire or harvest; the roots of the dead/cut tree will begin to send up suckers, creating identical individuals, and can result in a stand of clones that resemble that individual.
Growth.
Bigtooth aspens are dioecious, medium-sized deciduous trees with straight trunks and gently ascending branches. Heights at maturity are around 60–80 ft with diameters of 8–10 ft. They are fast growing and are relatively short-lived; stands will begin to deteriorate after 60–70 years, while individuals can live up to 100 years. They often constitute early successional species of their landscapes. Roots are shallow and wide spreading; lateral root growth in a forest may be as far as 60 ft. Generally, four to five lateral roots originate from the tree, and then branch within two feet; vertical, penetrating roots near the base anchor the tree.
Distribution.
The range of "Populus grandidentata" extends from Virginia north to Maine and Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia; west to southeastern Manitoba and Minnesota; south through Iowa to extreme northeastern Missouri; and east through Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and West Virginia. Disjunct populations are found in Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
Ecology.
The species is able to adapt to a wide range of soils, though it is most abundant on sands, loamy sands and light sandy loams. Big-tooth aspens can tolerate sandy uplands and high, rocky sites. The depth to the water table is generally about 5 ft. Soil must be moist but well-aerated for good growth. Being very shade intolerant, most shaded stems die. They are pioneer species on disturbed sites, persisting in successional communities until senescence. Rapid height growth of suckers allows it to outcompete other sprouting species such as red oak ("Quercus rubra") and red maple ("Acer rubrum") on many sites. In the absence of disturbance, it is soon replaced by conifers and hardwoods. In the Great Lakes Region at the turn of the 20th century, many mature pine forests were logged and burned. Bigtooth and quaking aspens frequently dominated the postdisturbance forests. Without fire or other disturbance, these forests are being replaced by later successional, shade-tolerant species. This aspen usually grows in even-aged, mixed stands, most commonly with quaking aspens. Codominant in both hardwood and conifer forests, it does not occur as a subdominant because of its extreme shade intolerance. Quaking aspen ("Populus tremuloides") is the predominant species in aspen stands in the Great Lakes region, but bigtooth aspen dominates on drier, upland sites. Aspen stands dominated by bigtooth aspens are generally more open than those dominated by quaking aspens. It is more disease resistant than "P. tremuloides". The most serious disease is hypoxylon canker (caused by "Entoleuca mammata"). Other rots, fungi, and root decay affect this species. A preferred host of gypsy moth, death occurs when nearly complete defoliation by gypsy moths is followed by a fungal infection by "Armillaria" spp. The ambrosia beetle ("Xyleborus saxesceni") attacks fire-damaged bigtooth aspens. Commonly, it occurs in areas that frequently burn, such as large upland areas distant from water and upwind of natural fire breaks, such as lakes.
Uses.
The wood is light-colored, straight-grained, fine-textured, and soft. It is used primarily for pulp, but can be used to make particle board and structural panels. Minor uses include log homes, pallets, boxes, match splints, chopsticks, hockey stick components, and ladders. The bark is pelletized for fuel and supplemental cattle feed.

Star of the South

The Star of the South, also known as "Estrela do Sul", is a diamond found in Brazil in July 1853. The diamond is cut into a cushion shape and weighs . The Star of the South is graded as a type IIa diamond, with a colour grading of fancy light pinkish-brown and a clarity of VS2. At the time of discovery, the diamond weighed . It has passed through the hands of many owners, including the Maharaja of princely Baroda State, and its last known purchase was by Cartier, the French luxury jeweller around 2002, when it was sold by Rustomjee Jamsetjee of Mumbai. The light reflected by the diamond is white, and the refracted light is of a rose tint. This gives the diamond its light pinkish-brown hue.
History.
The diamond was found by a slave girl named Rosa in 1853, at the Bagagem River in the city now called Estrela do Sul Diamond Mines in Brazil. It was handed over to her master, Casimiro de Moraes, who rewarded her for finding the diamond by granting her freedom and a pension for life. Casimiro de Moraes later sold it for £3,000, a price far lower than its actual value. The buyer deposited the diamond at the Bank of Rio de Janeiro for £30,000.
The uncut diamond was passed through the hands of several buyers, until it was bought by Costers of Amsterdam for £35,000. It was then cut into an oval cushion shape by a cutter called Voorsanger, renowned for having been one of the two men who refashioned the Koh-i Noor. 
It was purchased by Halphen and Associates of Paris, a syndicate of diamond merchants, who named it Estrela do Sul, or Star of the South. The syndicate exhibited the diamond 1862 at the Great London Exposition, and again 1867 at the International Exposition in Paris. On both occasions, the Star of the South received considerable attention. The diamond was later sent to a diamond dealing house in India, where negotiations were carried out to sell it to a Maharajah for a price of £110,000. However, this deal was not successful and the diamond was returned to Halphen and Associates. 
During the diamond’s stay in India, Prince Malhār Rāo of the royal family of Gaekwad got to know about the stone. He instructed E. H. Dresden of London to purchase the diamond, who purchased it from Halphen and Associates for £80,000 on behalf of the prince. The Star of the South was in the possession of the Gaekwad family for several years. It was later mounted on a necklace along with the English Dresden diamond. The "The Pittsburgh Press" reported in 1927, the diamond necklace which contained the Star of the South diamond, as a part of the royal collection worth $10,000,000 at the time, housed in the Nazarbaug Palace in Baroda; another important part of the collection was a cloth embroidered with precious stones and seed pearls, made to cover the tomb of Mohammed. In 1934, Prince Malhār Rāo’s son told Robert M. Shipley, an American gemologist about this. In 1948, the Maharani Sītā Devī, was photographed wearing the necklace at her husband Maharajah Pratāp Sinh's birthday party. 
The Star of the South was later purchased by Rustomjee Jamsetjee of Mumbai, who sold it to Cartier in 2002.
Characteristics.
At the time of discovery, the diamond had a rhombic dodecahedral form with obtuse angles and twenty four facets. There was a deep depression in one of the facets, indicating that it had accommodated another octahedral crystal. A few black specks were also present, caused by titanic iron or volcanic sand.
The diamond originally weighed and was cut into an oval cushion shape weighing , losing almost half of its weight in the cutting process. The dimensions of the Star of the South were 35 mm x 29 mm x 19 mm.
The light reflected by the diamond is white, and the refracted light is of a rose tint. This is attributed to the prismatic form given to the crystal during its cutting. The Star of the South has a colour grading of light pinkish-brown, pink and brown being two colours that can show up in colourless diamonds of type IIa. It is a plastically deformed diamond of type IIa, and has a clarity of VS2.
Dispute.
After the diamond was purchased by Cartier, Sangrām Sinh, the youngest son of Maharaja Pratāp Sinh Gaekwad of Baroda State, claimed that the Star of the South was among the heirlooms, the ownership of which was being disputed by the Gaekwad family. The diamond had been included in inventories disclosed in wealth tax returns filed in 1988 by Fāteh Sinh Rāo Gaekwad and his wife, heirs of the Gaekwad family. Sangrām Sinh has announced that he intends to trace how the diamond had reached Cartier and is considering possible legal action.

Digger slang

Digger slang, also known as ANZAC slang or Australian military slang, is Australian English slang as employed by the various Australian armed forces throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. There have been four major sources of the slang: the First World War, the Second World War, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The name Digger slang derives from the cultural stereotype of the Digger in the First World War. Graham Seal AM, Professor of Folklore at Curtin University of Technology, calls the slang Diggerese. It is a combination of an occupational jargon and an in-group argot.
First World War.
The first influence on Digger slang was Australia's involvement in the First World War. The soldiers themselves were not called Diggers until well into the war, the name first entering common use around 1917, with the first recorded use in something other than the traditional goldmining sense occurring in 1916. Originally, they were known as "Anzacs" after the abbreviation ANZAC for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, a name that quickly entered the mainstream lexicon and was even the subject of federal legislation within a year of its coinage. The War Precautions Act forbade the use of "ANZAC" in the name of any private residence, boat, vehicle, or charitable institution, on penalty of a £100 fine or six months in prison. The Australian government even petitioned the British government to enact similar restrictions.
The men of the Australian Imperial Force, and the women who nursed them, coined many words of Digger slang, including "Blighty" for Great Britain (it being the name for a wound severe enough to get one returned to Britain for hospitalization), "chocolate soldiers" (and thence "chocs") for soldiers who were believed to be unwilling to fight, and "six-bob-a-day tourists" for the soldiers themselves (a reference to their daily wages of six shillings).
As well as gaining slang versions of many French words from the areas in which the soldiers fought, such as "naipoo" for "no way" (taken from the French "il n'y a plus"), "tray bon" (from "très bon", and from which other Digger slang words such as "bonsterina" and "bontosher" were in turn derived), "plonk" (from "vin blanc") for cheap wine, and "cushy" for "easy"; the soldiers also incorporated Arabic words learned at their training grounds in Egypt, such as "saieeda" for "goodbye" and "imshi" for "go", and, most notably "bint" for a woman (who were also called "tabbies"). One slang phrase, going "to the top of the Wazir" derives its meaning, of doing something to excess, from a troop riot in the red light district Cairo on Good Friday 1915, over the prices being charged by prostitutes and the rumour that they were intentionally infecting the men with sexually transmitted diseases.
Many military-related words and phrases were also coined. The slang name "daisy-cutter", for an anti-personnel bomb, originated with Anzac slang, for example. Soldiers lived in "dugouts", fired from "possies" (positions), and fought against "Johnny Turk" or "Jacko". And they suffered from the "Gallipoli Gallop", dysentery. Like the U.S. Navy's "scuttlebutt", rumours shared amongst soldiers around the water-wagons, manufactured by Furphy & Sons, were known as "Furphys".
Some of the slang originated in the street slang of the larrikin pushes, such as "stoush" for "fight", which led to such words as "reinstoushments" for reinforcements. One of the essential components of the slang was the prolific (for the time) use of swearwords.
Much of this slang was collected by W. H. Downing in his book "Digger Dialects", which was published in 1919 (and reprinted in 1990).
Second World War.
The second influence on Digger slang was Australia's involvement in the Second World War. Some of the soldiers who had fought in the First World War perpetuated Digger slang into the second. These "retreads" were fit enough to return to action and continued the use of terms such as "bint", "backsheesh" for money, "shoofti" for a look around (borrowed via British slang from Arabic), and "guts" for news and information.
Several slang words and phrases evolved. What in the First World War had been a "base bludger", someone who hangs around headquarters avoiding the fighting (from "bludger", a British slang name for a pimp, and generally adopted as the name for any form of layabout), became a "base walloper" (also known as "fountain pen fusilier"), for example. Similarly, several new slang words and phrases appeared. A "shiny arse" was someone with a desk job at headquarters, and a "blue pencil warrior" was a propagandist.
Many slang phrases were expressions of malcontent, such as "wouldn't it root ya?!", an expression of disgust, which came in many Bowdlerized variations, from "wouldn't it rotate yer?!" to "wouldn't it rot your socks?!". The shortened version of this, "wouldn't it?!" is still in use today. Anything thought to be nonsense was "a lot of cock" (sometimes "a lot of hot cock"). Something that was useless was "as much use as a cuntful of cold piss" (or "not worth a cuntful of cold water"), and a malfunctioning piece of equipment was "cactus" (originally 1940s RAAF slang, and briefly revived in the 1980s). Other Digger slang expressions involving complaint and error were "whinge", "balls-up", and "upter" (a contraction of "up to shit"). Food was called "afterbirth", a cook was a "bait layer", a quartermaster a "q bastard", and a sergeant's mess a "snake pit". Someone who wanted to "give the game to the blacks" was expressing unhappiness with the army or the war.
One significant source of slang were the prisoner of war camps run by the Japanese, where Diggers sometimes ended up. These were the sources of many particularly strong expressions, such as "white nip" for a prisoner who collaborated with the Japanese, and "japs", "nips", "jeeps", "little yellow men", and "little yellow bastards" for the Japanese themselves. In the camps, "kippers" were the British POWs, and "cheese-eaters" the Dutch. The urinals were "pissaphones" and the stew served to prisoners was "Danube", a contraction of the rhyming slang "Blue Danube".
There were many other Digger slang words and phrases coined during the Second World War. Two of the most notable are "wheelbarrow" for a conscript (because he had to be pushed) and "doover", a general name for just about anything at all. Others include "snarlers", who were soldiers from the Middle East who were "SNLR" ("Services No Longer Required") and sent home on "three P boats" (troopships that contained "pox, prisoners, and provosts").
Korean and Vietnam Wars.
The third influence on Digger slang were Australia's involvement in the Korean War and its involvement in the Vietnam War. As with the Second World War, much of the slang was carried over, and some of it evolved. In the Second World War, a subaltern was "baggie-arsed", but was simply a "baggie" by the time of the Korean War. Similarly, the Second World War "mongaree" and "monga" for food, taken from Arabic as "mongy" was taken from the French "manger" in the First World War, and from which "hard monga" for iron rations and "soft monga" for ordinary food were derived, became "mongar", this time adopted from Italian. World War II "cock orange" for a commanding officer became a "cock oboe" in the Korean War.
The Korean War introduced further words to Digger slang, which were re-used in the Vietnam War. One such was "hutchie", the equivalent to World War I "dugout", taken from the Japanese word for a house. The Vietnam War introduced "noggies" for Vietnamese in general ("gooks" being the North Vietnamese in particular), "frag" (shared with U.S. military slang) for a foolhardy officer killed by his own men, "bush-bash" (a reference to four-wheel driving practices in the Australian Outback) for a jungle patrol, "mammasan" for a madam of a brothel, and "Saigon rose" (or "Vietnamese rose") for a particular sexually transmitted disease. Other Digger slang words coined during the peacetime after the Second World War and that were then used in the wars were "nasho" for a national serviceman.
Modern Operations.
Australia's involvement in numerous United Nations peacekeeping operations, regional stabilisation operations such as Bougainville and Solomon Islands, as well as East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan, have created new opportunities for Diggers to work and interact closely with soldiers and civilians from other nations. In Iraq, a local man was known as a "smufti". Getting sick from eating local food was known as "intestinal jihad". The American combat rations allocated to Diggers on combat patrols, Meals Ready to Eat ("MRE") were known as "Meals Ready to Excrete". A Digger who did not patrol outside of the wire was a "Fobbit", derived from the NATO acronym FOB (Forward Operating Base). Rifles were known as "bang-sticks", "tools" or a "woody". A task which went wrong was known as a "cluster-fuck" and if no-one was to blame then it was due to the "Inshallah factor". The slang term for the Middle Eastern areas of operations was referred to as the “Sand pit”. 
A lazy Digger was known as a "jackman", "jack", or "oxygen-thief". "Jack" is most commonly used as an adjective for a person or behaviour that places the individual performing the action's interests ahead of those of the team. The term “Quoinker” is used to describe someone who would suck up, befriend or attempt to please persons of higher rank. This expression would also be used by mates of a soldier as they received an award, accolade or just general praise for a job well done. This is done by the soldiers mates to remind the praised soldier that they are not getting the award for hard work but for “Quoinking”
Due to the institutionalised nature of military weapons training in Australia, a number of metaphors associated with rifle ranges were applied to operations. Combat was known as the "two way rifle range", returning fire to the enemy was known as "putting a few rounds down range", and coordinating Diggers for a large, long, boring or mundane job was known to be as exciting as a "brass party at Gallipoli" (brass parties painstakingly collect all of the expended ammunition cartridges off the ground at the completion of a rifle range practice). The boredom or repetitive mundane aspects of operations were described by the term "living the dream" or the American term "Groundhog Day".An item of equipment that is either of high quality or particularly useful may be described as "gucci." These items are almost invariably not standard issue. 
Some slang has retained significant longevity and while finding its origins in previous conflicts are nevertheless still used by Diggers today. For example, medals were known as "gongs" or "tin". Common sense was known as "CDF" or "common dog fuck" and the morning of the last day in theatre of operations or exercise was known as a "wakey". The small metal spoon found in the Australian Defence Force's 24 hour combat ration pack, called a Field Ration Eating Device, was abbreviated to "FRED" (said to stand for Fucking Ridiculous Eating Device). 
Some Digger slang entered mainstream Australian English vocabulary. Some examples of this were "zap", "waste" or "turn into pink mist", all originally taken from U.S. military slang, meaning "to kill". Similar influence of Digger stereotyping on mainstream vocabulary has been the retention of "returned-servicemen" or "vets" for what in many other countries are called veterans. The latter name became more common in the 1980s with the creation of the Department of Veterans Affairs by the federal government, but "returned-servicemen" still remains in popular usage through the Returned Servicemen League clubs.

Henry Shaw Briggs

Henry Shaw Briggs (August 1, 1824 – September 23, 1887) was brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
During the war, Briggs served as a captain with the 8th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. He was the colonel and first commander of the 10th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. After suffering serious wounds during the Battle of Fair Oaks in 1862, Briggs was promoted to brigadier general and served primarily administrative commands in Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia. He was, however, periodically assigned various brigade commands in the field for brief periods during the latter half of the war.
Both prior to and after the war, Briggs was a lawyer and politician. He served as a state legislator, Massachusetts Auditor and a judge.
Early years.
Briggs was born to George Nixon Briggs, (governor of Massachusetts from 1844–1851) on August 1, 1824 in Lanesborough, Massachusetts. Henry Briggs graduated from Williams College in 1844 and was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1848.
On August 6, 1849, Briggs married Mary Elizabeth Talcott, daughter of Nathianiel P. Talcott of Lanesborough, Massachusetts.
Shortly before the war, Briggs established a law practice in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He took an interest in military affairs as well and became captain of a company of state militia in Pittsfield known as the "Allen Guards." Briggs also took an active interest in politics. In 1856, he served as a member of the Massachusetts Legislature.
Civil War service.
8th Massachusetts.
In the days following the attack on Fort Sumter, Briggs's company became Company K of the 8th Massachusetts. After reaching Maryland, Company K was detached from the regiment and assigned garrison duty at Fort McHenry near Baltimore. The company eventually rejoined the rest of the regiment and labored to repair and guard the railroads in the vicinity of Baltimore.
10th Massachusetts.
On June 21, 1861, Briggs was detached from service with the 8th Massachusetts, promoted to colonel and placed in command of the newly formed 10th Massachusetts. The regiment reached Washington, D.C. on July 28 and spent the remainder of 1861 in camp near Washington, drilling and preparing for the spring campaign. The regiment was eventually attached to the IV Corps.
In March 1862, Major General George B. McClellan commenced his Peninsular Campaign aimed at capturing the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. As the Army of the Potomac (of which the 10th Massachusetts was a part), moved by water to the Virginia Peninsula, Col. Briggs was placed in command of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division of the IV Corps on March 13, 1862. He served in this capacity until May 1862 when he was replaced by Brig. Gen. Charles Devens and returned to command the 10th Massachusetts. The 10th Massachusetts, led by Briggs, saw its first major action during the Battle of Fair Oaks on May 31, 1862. The regiment suffered severe casualties during this engagement and Col. Briggs was seriously wounded, shot through both legs.
Brigade commands.
The severity of his wounds obliged Briggs to relinquish command of the 10th Massachusetts. He returned to Massachusetts for the remainder of the summer of 1862 to recover. For his "gallant conduct on the field" during the Battle of Fair Oaks, Briggs was promoted to brigadier general on July 17, 1862. In September 1862, Briggs was re-assigned to command Camp Chase on Arlington Heights just outside of Washington. This was a training camp for new regiments arriving in Washington from across the country. During the Maryland Campaign in September 1862, Briggs was briefly assigned to command the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division of the V Corps taking several fresh regiments to reinforce McClellan's Army of the Potomac. Briggs, however, had not fully recovered from his wounds and was unable to take the field.
In February 1863, Briggs was assigned to the Army's Middle Department, commanding a brigade in the VIII Corps serving guard duty in Maryland. Serving in this capacity until July 1863, Briggs's headquarters was in Baltimore.
For two weeks in the latter part of July 1863, during the Confederate retreat from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Briggs was placed in command of a brigade of the 1st Division, I Corps. His brigade did not see any significant action during this time. August 1863 found Briggs in command of another training camp in Alexandria, Virginia known as the "Rendezvous for Draftees," a post he maintained until July 1864.
From that date until his resignation on December 4, 1865, Briggs served on court-martial boards in Washington.
Post-war career.
Briggs returned to a political and law career after the war. From 1865 to 1868, he served as Massachusetts Auditor. With the establishment of the District Court of Central Berkshire in 1869, Briggs was appointed a standing justice of that court in recognition of his law career and his duty on court-martial boards during the war. Briggs resigned from the bench in 1873.
Briggs died of heart disease on September 23, 1887.

Our Lady of the Wayside Church

Our Lady of the Wayside Church is a modest church built in 1912 for the then-growing Catholic parish of Portola Valley by a combined effort of Jewish, Protestant and Catholic members of The Family, a San Francisco men's club that owns a nearby rural retreat.
The building itself was constructed of steel-reinforced concrete with stucco finish in the Mission Revival style, with the added Georgian element of the main doorway with its scrolled pediment. Mission Revival features include the tiled gable roof with exposed rafter ends, round-arched windows and buttressed side walls.
James Rupert Miller, an architect and a member of The Family, gave the assignment of designing the church to a rising young draftsman at his firm: Timothy L. Pflueger. The building was 19-year-old Pflueger's first commission. Pflueger drew on his familiarity with Mission San Francisco de Asís in his native San Francisco for inspiration.
In 1977, a plaque was placed proclaiming the building as California Registered Historical Landmark number 909. The church was also added to the National Register of Historical Places in 1977.
The historic church suffered extensive damage in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and was recommended for demolition by structural experts. Instead, it was repaired by its congregation at a cost of US$600,000.

Edward Einhorn

Edward Einhorn (born September 6, 1970) is an American playwright, theater director, and novelist, noted for the comic absurdism of his drama and the imaginative richness of his literary works.
A native of Westfield, New Jersey, Einhorn graduated from Westfield High School, where he was an editor of the student newspaper "Hi's Eye". He attended Johns Hopkins University. In 1992 he started the Untitled Theater Company #61 in New York (co-founded with his older brother David Einhorn, who has produced plays for the company). With that company, Edward Einhorn has directed T. S. Eliot's "Sweeney Agonistes", Eugène Ionesco's "The Bald Soprano", Dennis Potter's "Brimstone and Treacle", and Richard Foreman's "My Head Was a Sledgehammer" among other works. He has staged a festival of the complete plays of Eugène Ionesco, a festival of the complete plays of Václav Havel, a calypso musical adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's "Cat's Cradle", an adaptation of "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep", and a "NEUROfest" of plays on aspects of neurology. Off-Broadway, he directed "Fairy Tales of the Absurd", a trilogy of one-act plays, two by Ionesco and one ("One Head Too Many") by himself.
As playwright, Einhorn has composed one-act and full-length plays, including dramas on Jewish legends and a series of plays on neurological conditions — "The Boy Who Wanted to be a Robot" (on Asperger syndrome), "The Taste of Blue", (on synesthesia), "Strangers" (on Korsakov's syndrome), and "Linguish" (on aphasia). He has adapted the "Lysistrata" of Aristophanes for modern audiences. He has also written a few plays on Czech subjects, such as "Rudolf II" (based on the 16th century Emperor who lived in Prague), and "The Velvet Oratorio" (a Vaněk play staged at Lincoln Center and based on the events of the Velvet Revolution). His most personal play, "Drs. Jane and Alexander", is a found text piece about his mother and his grandfather, Alexander Wiener, who discovered the Rh factor in blood.
He has written two Oz novels, "Paradox in Oz" and "The Living House of Oz" (both illustrated by Eric Shanower), as well as a number of short stories. He has also written a book on probability for young readers, "A Very Improbable Story," illustrated by Adam Gustavson. A number of his plays have also been published, including his Hanukkah drama, "Playing Dreidel with Judah Maccabee" 
In 2011, he authored the first English language translation of Václav Havel's final play, "The Pig, or Václav Havel's Hunt for a Pig", as well as Havel's one-act, "Ela, Hela, and the Hitch". Both were published, as part of Theater 61 Press' Havel Collection. Einhorn also wrote the introductions to all the books in the Havel Collection.
In the year 2000, Einhorn was involved in a supposed controversy with playwright Richard Foreman over Foreman's "Lava", although Einhorn has stated that the reviewer mistook a joke in the play for a real controversy. Four years later, Einhorn was involved in a more genuine controversy with the producers of Nancy McClernan's play "Tam Lin", which resulted in legal action.

Ning Cheng

Ning Cheng (, fl. 141 BC) was an official of the western Han dynasty under Emperors Jing and Wu. He was known for his harsh application of the law, such that officials travelling to and from his area of governance would say to each other "Better to face a nursing tigress than the wrath of Ning Cheng!"
Ning Cheng initially served under Emperor Jing as a palace attendant and master of guests. He employed dishonest means to reach positions of power, eventually being appointed as chief commandant of Jinan. His predecessors in the post had all approached Zhi Du, the governor of Jinan, as though they were mere county officials owing to their fear of him, but Ning Cheng considered him an equal and sought to outdo him. Having known Ning Cheng by reputation, Zhi Du befriended him. Years later, after Zhi Du's death, Emperor Jing appointed Ning Cheng as a military commander in Changan in order to stymie the large number of crimes committed by imperial relatives. Ning Cheng emulated Zhi Du's style of governance and soon became an object of fear to everyone in the imperial family.
Upon Emperor Wu's accession to the throne, he made Ning Cheng prefect of the capital. However, the emperor's in-laws took every opportunity to slander Ning Cheng, ultimately resulting in his conviction. Despite it being customary for high officials of the time to commit suicide when charged with a capital offence, Ning Cheng submitted to even the most severe of punishments. Eventually, he escaped and made his way home, forging papers in order to get through the pass.
Declaring that "An official who can't advance to a salary of 2,000 piculs or a merchant who can't make at least 10,000,000 cash is not fit to be called a man!", Ning Cheng borrowed money and bought over 1,000 qing (equivalent to about 600 million square feet) of farmland on which he employed several thousand poor families to work. By the time a general amnesty was declared years later, he had amassed several thousand pieces of gold and exerted more power over the populace than the governor of the region did. Later, Emperor Wu took him out of retirement and made him chief commandant of Hangu Pass after Gongsun Hong's protests that he was like a "wolf driving a flock of sheep" had prevented Ning Cheng from becoming a provincial governor.
When Yi Zong was travelling from Henei to Nanyang to take up a post of governor at the latter, Ning Cheng had retired again and was living in Nanyang. Despite meeting Yi Zong at the pass and escorting him on his way, Ning Cheng's courtesy was not reciprocated. Instead, Yi Zong pressed charges against the Ning family forthwith and utterly demolished their homes. As a result, Ning Cheng was convicted of an offence.

Career.
She had her first schooling in Washington DC from 1942 to 1945, since her family was exiled because of the German occupation of Norway. After the war she completed her primary and lower secondary education at Lysaker and Stabekk, before finishing her secondary education at Hegdehaugen in 1954.

Edward Bagshaw (theologian)

Edward Bagshaw (Bagshawe), the younger (1629–1671) was an English Nonconformist minister and theologian, known as a controversialist. His sympathies were with the fringe Independent sects of the Commonwealth period, and after the English Restoration of 1660 his life was embattled. Richard Baxter criticized Bagshaw as "an Anabaptist, Fifth Monarchy man, and a Separatist".
Life.
His father Edward Bagshawe was a lawyer and politician. Henry Bagshaw (1632–1709) was his brother.
He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where John Locke was also, when Bagshaw was a Student (i.e. Fellow of the college). Locke’s "Two Tracts on Government", representing more orthodox views of the time, were intended as replies to Bagshaw’s views on religious toleration, published as "The Great Question Concerning Things Indifferent" in 1659.
A position teaching at Westminster School in 1656 ended badly when he quarreled with headmaster Richard Busby. He was ordained in 1659 by Ralph Brownrigg, and became vicar at Ambrosden, but was soon ejected for non-conformity.
A large and acrimonious pamphlet literature grew up around Bagshaw, some of it generated by his hostility to George Morley, the Restoration bishop of Worcester (translated in 1662 to Winchester), and Dean of Christ Church from 1660. He was chaplain to Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey in 1661. He then spent a time imprisoned in the Tower of London, from early 1663. He was attacked in print by Roger L'Estrange. 
In the last year of his life he published a biography of Vavasor Powell. To the end he was also arguing out the separatist case against Richard Baxter, who hoped to keep dissenters (apart from the extremes) within the Church of England. Bagshaw hit out at Baxter's lukewarm position on dissent. In 1672, Baxter was still accusing Bagshaw of tricky polemics, in trying to draw discussion of the position of honest Nonconformist dissenters onto the touchy grounds of full toleration, politics and war.
He died while on parole from Newgate Prison, and was buried in Bunhill Fields.

Material Culture and Social Formations in Ancient India

Material Culture and Social Formations in Ancient India is a book by Professor Ram Sharan Sharma, published in 1985. The author surveys theories of social change and underlines the key role of production techniques together with climatic conditions in shaping ancient social formations. Several questions are raised: What was the extent of cattle pastoralism in early Vedic times and how was it linked with tribalism and booty capture? Why could the later Vedic people not develop a full-fledged state and class system? What part did iron play in war and production in northern India? Why did Buddhism appear around 600 BC and why did this happen in the middle Gangetic plains? How many forms of society are reflected in the epics? Rural relics of ancient life and its glimpses in terracottas are also discussed. To tackle these problems, Vedic, epic and Buddhist texts are examined in the light of material remains, tribal studies and archaic social survivals.
It has been published by Macmillan Publishers.

Urban Decay in India (c. 300-c. 1000)

Urban Decay in India (c. 300-c. 1000) is a book written by Ram Sharan Sharma published in 1987 by Munshiram Manoharlal, Delhi ISBN 978-8121500456. 
Overview.
The book focuses on the decline of the towns and their desertion in late ancient and early medieval India on the basis of archaeological evidence. The author has material remains to study crafts, commerce and coinage, and identifies and illustrates signs of growth and decay for more than 130 excavated sites. The strata with poor remains are taken to indicate decrease in construction, manufacturing and commercial activities, and are hence associated with de-urbanization. The reasons for the urban eclipse are sought not only in the fall of empires but also in social disorder and the loss of long-distance trade. The disintegration of the town life is seen not as social regression but as part of the social transformation which generated classical feudalism and promoted rural expansion. The book explores the link between urban decay and land grants to officials, priests, temples and monasteries. It shows how the landed elements collected surplus and services directly from the peasants, and remunerated artisan servicing castes through land grants and grain supply. The monograph should interest students of pre-modern urban history and those who study processes of change in economy and society in Gupta and post-Gupta times. It may also provide basic information on the urban horizons of excavated sites during the second half of the first millennium BC and the following six centuries AD.

In 2007, the company name was changed to Hisense Kelon Electrical Holdings Limited after the acquisition.
H shares trading suspended 2005–2009.
On June 16, 2005, Kelon announced that trading in its H shares was suspended "pending the release of an announcement in relation to price sensitive information". This was because Kelon's former chairman and largest shareholder, Gu Chujun, was involved in seizing company assets and was being investigated by the Foshan police.

Vertical cut recording

The vertical cut recording process is an early method of audio recording by which a stylus cuts a vertical groove into a phonograph record. This is in contrast to the lateral recording system which uses a stylus that cuts side-to-side across a record. The vertical recording process, also known as the hill and dale process, was used to record phonograph cylinder records as well as Edison Disc Records, Pathé disc records, and disc records made by numerous smaller companies. Vertical cut recording was also used as a means of copyright protection by the early Muzak 16-inch background music discs. 
In this process the stylus makes a vertical cut, its depth determined in accordance with the current in the recording coil. The grooves of vertically cut records have a constant separation and varying depth, as opposed to grooves of laterally cut records, which have a varying distance of separation and constant depth.
If a vertically cut groove was examined under a microscope along its length, you would see a continuous wavy line as the needle cuts at different depths according to the tone and the loudness of the audio being recorded. These grooves show a transition from high to low peak as a smooth curve, giving the characteristic rounded 'hill and dale' effect to the groove, similar to the appearance of many geographic areas.
Recording is by mechanical means and the vibrations from acoustic energy, transferred to a cutting needle, make the needle cut a deeper or shallower groove. It is necessary to set the parameters of the cutting depth accurately as too shallow a groove on silent sections and the playback device, also a needle, will slip out of place, and too deep and you risk cutting through the thin layer of recording medium and/or creating excessive wear when the recording is played back, due to mechanical noise generated by the recording system the needle is never totally still, total silence would produce a flat even depth groove, so the hill and dale effect exists over all the audio recording section.

Choose to Love, Live or Die is an EP by Australian metalcore band I Killed the Prom Queen.
The original line-up of I Killed The Prom Queen consisted of vocalist Lee Stacy, guitarist Jona Weinhofen, drummer Josef Peters, bass guitarist Ben Engel and second guitarist Simon O'Gorman. The following year Michael Crafter, now synonymous with I Killed The Prom Queen and Australian Hardcore, joined the group to share the vocal duties. Soon after this Leaton Rose, now of the band The Hot Lies, replace Engel on bass. The group then recorded a four track demo which would become "Choose to Love, Live or Die". This demo was later re-released as an EP by Final Prayer Records. All of the songs found on this recording were re-recorded for the band's third EP "Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You".
Track listing.
As Michael Crafter explains on the DVD "Sleepless Nights and City Lights", there was originally supposed to be a 5th track on the album. But, it was accidentally deleted from the computer in the studio they were using, so they decided to stick with just four.

Joseph C. Hare

Joseph Coulson Hare (June 15, 1863—May 11, 1937) was an American politician and lumberman in Oregon. A native of Hillsboro, he was the son of William D. Hare; both were mayors of Hillsboro. Hares Canyon in Washington County is named in his honor.
Early life.
Hare was born in Hillsboro, Oregon, to William D. Hare and Henrietta Hare (née Schofield) on June 15, 1863. One of seven children, including William G. Hare, he was educated in the schools of Hillsboro. After his primary education Hare attended Pacific University in nearby Forest Grove. In 1883, he married the former Elinor Grace Bothwell; they had one son, William B., who became a doctor and naval surgeon.
Career.
After college Hare started in the lumber business, acquiring holdings in mills in the northwest part of Oregon. He was also involved in civic affairs in Hillsboro, serving on the city council from 1890 to 1894. In 1893, Hare was elected as the 13th mayor of Hillsboro, serving in office from December 5, 1893 until December 4, 1894, a position previously held by his father. He also had a dairy farm of near the city along the Tualatin River, named Holyrood in honor of his wife’s ancestors from Scotland.
In 1897, he built a sawmill near what is now Beaverton followed by a mill near Buxton in 1912. Here his company logged parts of the Northern Oregon Coast Range, including a valley that was later named after him. A member of the Republican Party and a Mason, Hare retired from the logging business in 1917 and moved to Portland, but remained active in the Ancient Order of United Workmen forestry fraternal organization.
Legacy.
A railroad station near Manning, west of Buxton, and another stop in Aloha between Beaverton and Hillsboro, were both named for Hare. Hares Canyon near Buxton was also named for him. In August 2003, a new state park in the Hares Canyon was to be named Hares Canyon State Park, but the name was later changed to L. L. "Stub" Stewart State Park.

Dungeness, Romney Marsh and Rye Bay

Dungeness, Romney Marsh and Rye Bay is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest that stretches across two English counties:Kent and East Sussex. It is of both geological and biological interest.
Its geological interest is the geomorphology of Dungeness and Rye Harbour. The area is a cuspate foreland of shingle ridges formed by thousands of years of coastal erosion and accretion.
The biological interest is due to its habitats of salt marsh, saline lagoons, vegetated shingle, sand dunes and ditch systems. These host a wide variety of fauna, some of which is nationally rare. The area also supports large numbers of breeding and non-breeding birds.

LAPD Air Support Division

The Los Angeles Police Department Air Support Division (ASD) is the airborne law enforcement program of the LAPD. It is the largest municipal airborne law enforcement organization in the United States and operates from the LAPD Hooper Heliport.
While originally devoted to aerial traffic enforcement, it has grown to support a wide variety of police activity. Today, its operations are divided between Air Support To Regular Operations (ASTRO) and Special Flight Section (SFS). The ASD motto is "The mission is the same, only the vehicle has changed." The Air Support Division currently operates 19 aircraft of 2 different models, and maintains the largest municipal police aviation unit around the world, in addition to having the world's largest roof-top airport and world's busiest heliport.
History.
The Air Support Division (ASD) was established as the LAPD Helicopter Unit in 1956 with one Hiller UH-12C Three-seat helicopter. They added a second helicopter in 1963 and a third in 1965. The city operated Bell 47G and 47J model helicopters. In 1968, the unit received its first Bell 206A JetRanger. With a major expansion in 1974, the Helicopter Unit was renamed the Air Support Division. At that time, the ASD grew to 15 helicopters and one Cessna 210 manned by 77 sworn personnel. In 1976, the ASD added the Special Flight Section (SFS), a unit dedicated to supporting undercover police operations. In this support role, SFS is a significant contributor to narcotics and serialized criminal investigations. In 1988, the ASD added its first Aerospatiale AS350B-1. The city replaced all but 4 of the Bell 206 JetRangers and retired the older piston models.
Fleet.
Today the Air Support Division consists of 88 sworn personnel and 19 helicopters which include five Bell 206B3 JetRangers, 14 Eurocopter AS-350B2 AStars, and one Beechcraft King Air 200 twin-engined aircraft.
The city of Los Angeles briefly flew a fleet of Bell 407s in the late 1990s as a replacement for the AS-350B1s. However, in 2000 the LAPD started replacing the 407s with more powerful AS-350B2s. Two of the 407s were sold to the General Services Department which uses the helicopters on flights for the Department of Water and Power.

Accidents and incidents.
On November 30, 1964 Sergeant Norman D. Piepenbrink was killed in a helicopter accident.
On August 30, 1966 Policemen Larry Amberg and Alex N. Ilnicki, were on traffic patrol in Air 1 (Bell 47G Reg.N1162W) flying in the vicinity of Dodger Stadium, and a media helicopter (Bell 47G reg. N1157W) was also in the area reporting on freeway traffic conditions. Air 1 and the media helicopter collided, resulting in the deaths of both officers and the occupants of the media helicopter. Policeman Ilnicki had about 401 hours of total flight time and 236 hours in type at the time of the crash
On May 29, 1974 Commander Paul J. Gillen was killed when his helicopter crashed.
On June 11, 1976, Officer Jeffrey B. Lindenberg was killed when the Bell 47G-5 helicopter (U.S. registraion N7085J) he was training in lost power and crashed while landing. Lindenberg was practicing simulated urban high-rise rooftop landings at an off-site pad on top of a small mountain near the Los Angeles Zoo in the hills above Hollywood. On short final approach, the engine lost power and the helicopter impacted short of the pad. The Helicopter rolled down the mountain side . Lindenberg was killed and another officer was seriously injured. Lindenberg had been with the agency for seven years. Lindenberg was an experienced instrument rated pilot with 3575 hours of total flight time and 426 in type.
On March 1, 1983, Reserve Officer Stuart Taira was killed as a result of a police helicopter crash. Taira, an observer for the helicopter unit, and two other officers were conducting aerial patrols following a tornado. In between patrols the officers were dispatched to investigate a report of a burglar on a roof. As the helicopter took off it struck a power line, causing it to crash. The officers survived the initial impact and Taira was able to exit the aircraft. Taira then returned to the aircraft in an attempt to rescue his two partners. One of the helicopter's rotors struck Taira in the head, killing him. Taira was posthumously awarded the department's Medal of Valor.
On June 13, 1991, Officers Gary Alan Howe and Charles Randall Champe were killed when they experienced an in-flight engine failure which caused their helicopter to crash into a parking lot. They were flying an AS350B1 helicopters (U.S. registraion N214LA).

Stefan Wiechecki

Stefan Wiechecki (pen-name Wiech; 10 August 1896 – 26 July 1979) was a Polish writer and journalist. He is most fondly remembered for his humorous feuilletons, which chronicled the everyday life of Warsaw and cultivated the Warsaw dialect.
Stefan Wiechecki was born August 10, 1896. In inter-war Poland he collaborated with numerous Warsaw-based newspapers, initially as a court reporter. During numerous trials he documented typical personalities of the poorer, less-known part of the city with its distinctive culture, language and customs. With time he was given his own column in "Express Wieczorny" evening newspaper, where he published humorous sketches and feuilletons featuring personalities based on people taking part in trials he took part in. They gained much popularity and in late 1930s Wiechecki opened a chocolate shop in the borough of Praga, which became his main source of income. 
During the Warsaw Uprising, he was cut off from his house on the other side of the river, in the Old Town. There he collaborated with numerous newspapers published in the Polish-held part of town, notably the "Powstaniec". Sharing the fate of the rest of Warsaw's civilians, Wiechecki was forced out of the city after the end of the uprising. However, he returned soon after the town was retaken from the Germans and resumed his duties as a journalist. Some of his humorous stories were published in book form, while others continued to be published by Warsaw-based newspapers. 
While criticised by linguists and polonists for "filling the Polish language with trash", he was nevertheless considered a classic of the Warsaw dialect, at that time suppressed by schools along with all other non-standard variations of the literary language. One of the scientists to defend him in numerous articles was Bronisław Wieczorkiewicz, who later published the first monograph on the dialects of Warsaw. A renowned Polish poet Julian Tuwim dubbed Wiechecki the "Homer of Warsaw's streets and Warsaw's language", his feuilletons are also mentioned in the works of Antoni Słonimski, Stefan Kisielewski and Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska. He died July 26, 1979 in Warsaw, where he is buried. After 1989 one of the main pedestrian-only zones of downtown Warsaw was officially named the "Wiech Passage" in honour of Wiechecki.

Temperature-programmed reduction

Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is a technique for the characterization of solid materials and is often used in the field of heterogeneous catalysis to find the most efficient reduction conditions, an oxidized catalyst precursor is submitted to a programmed temperature rise while a reducing gas mixture is flowed over it.
Process description.
A simple container (U-tube) is filled with a solid or catalyst. This sample vessel is positioned in a furnace with temperature control equipment. A thermocouple is placed in the solid for temperature measurement. To remove the present air the container is filled with an inert gas (nitrogen, argon). Flow controllers are used to add hydrogen (for example, 10 Vol -% hydrogen in nitrogen). The composition of the gaseous mixture is measured at the exit of the sample container with appropriate detectors (thermal conductivity detector, mass spectrometer). Now, the sample in the oven is heated up on predefined values. Heating values are usually between 1 K/min and 20K/min. If a reduction takes place at a certain temperature, hydrogen is consumed, which is recorded by the detector. In practice the production of water is a more accurate way of measuring the reduction. This is due to the potential for varying hydrogen concentrations at the inlet, so the decrease in this number may not be precise, however as the starting concentration of water will be zero, any increase can be measured more accurately.

HMS Geyser (1841)

HMS "Geyser" was a "Driver"-class wooden paddle sloop of the Royal Navy constructed in 1841 and broken up in 1866.
Design and construction.
"Geyser" was ordered on 12 March 1840 as the fourth of a class of 6 second-class steam vessels. She was laid down in Aug 1840 and launched on 6 April 1841. She was long on the gundeck and displaced 1,590 tons. Power for her paddles came from a Seaward & Capel 2-cylinder direct-acting steam engine developing 280 nominal horsepower, which was fitted at Woolwich in May 1841. Having conducted engine trials in the River Thames, she left Woolwich for Sheerness on 31 October 1841 to be coppered and made ready for sea. She was commissioned for the first time at Sheerness on 8 March 1842.
Service history.
She served in the Mediterranean and the Levant in 1846. By December 1848 she was at the Cape of Good Hope. On 16 February 1850 she rescued the survivors of the barque "Childe Harold", a passenger ship homeward bound from Australia. "Childe Harold" had struck the south east point of Dassen Island on the West Coast of South Africa. The only fatality was the Master, James Byres, who drowned while attempting to swim ashore with a line. 
She spent much of 1851 conducting anti-slavery patrols off the coast of Brazil. On 11 February 1851 she captured the slave brig "Mangano" in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro. The slaver was sent for adjudication to the Vice-Admiralty Court at St. Helena, and in June 1851 she was sentenced to be restored to her master without costs.
She was present at the Fleet Review at Spithead on 23 April 1856, and in 1857 was at Simon's Town in South Africa for patrols off the East Coast of Africa. On 23 June 1860 she was recommissioned at Devonport for service on the Home Station as a storeship.
Fate.
"Geyser" was broken up in 1866.

Benzylisoquinoline

1-Benzylisoquinoline is a chemical compound, and the structural backbone of many alkaloids with a wide variety of structures, including papaverine, noscapine, codeine, morphine, apomorphine, berberine, protopine, tubocurarine, and sanguinarine.
Biosynthesis.
Plants producing benzylisoquinoline alkaloids have a common biosynthetic pathway, making use of two units of L-tyrosine. One tyrosine molecule is metabolised to dopamine which constitutes the isoquinoline part, while the benzylic part is mostly formed from tyramine, itself the decarboxylation product of tyrosine.
Many benzylisoquinolines have a methylated nitrogen atom as well as functional groups containing oxygen (-OH, -OCH3, -OCH2O-) in positions 6, 7, 3' and 4'. The latter come from the precursors mentioned above, namely tyrosine, dopamine and their derivatives.

Egyptian Communist Organisation

The Egyptian Communist Organisation (, "al-Munaẓẓamah aš-Šiūʿīah al-Miṣriyyah", abbreviated م.ش.م) was a political organisation in Egypt. The group emerged in mid-1948 as the Voice of the Opposition, following a split from the Democratic Movement for National Liberation. Voice of the Opposition published "Sawt al-brulitaria" (صوت البروليتاريا, 'Voice of the Proletariat'). In December 1948 the group merged with the group Toward Bolshevik Organisation, becoming the Egyptian Communist Organisation. It was dubbed as 'MISHMISH', a pejorative distortition of its acronym. "Mishmish" (مشمش) means apricot in Arabic.
The leadership of MISHMISH was almost exclusively Jewish, made up by former members of the "Iskra" group. Albeit the organisation adopted a '100% proletarian' line, most of its leaders came from wealthy backgrounds.
MISHMISH condemned the Egyptian military intervention in Palestine as a 'racist war'. It saw that war as a ploy of the Arab bourgeoise, supported by imperialists, to divert the class struggle of Arab workers. The organisation called for Jewish self-determination in Palestine. In the view of MISHMISH Zionism would not be able to retain its dominance over Jewish politics in Palestine as the Jewish working class would be radicalised, and that Israel could develop into a socialist state.
In 1949 MISHMISH was one of the bigger communist splinter groups, with several hundreds of members. Its relationship to other communist groups was however very bad. MISHMISH routinely dubbed the other communist groups as police informers, blaming them for arrests of communists. Moreover, it began to label all other Egyptian communist groups as 'Titoists'.
In early 1949, two MISHMISH cadres were arrested in Alexandria. In August 1950 the Cairo-based leadership of the group (Sidney Solomon, Odette Solomon, Aslan Cohen, Miray Cohen and Mohamed Sid-Ahmed) was arrested. After the August 1950 arrests, the organisation became dormant. In 1954 it was dissolved, as the Solomon couple left Egypt.

Foster Greer Thorbecke

The Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (sometimes referred to as FGT) metric is a generalized measure of poverty within an economy. It measures the outfall from the povertyline and is weighted by formula_1. Therefore it is also considering the inequality among the poor but as the proper amount for formula_1 is not pre defined (and a normative question) we cannot say that the Gini is part of the FGT. 
%Also P0 is not part of FGT. The only measure that is combining P0, P1 and Gini is the Sen Index. 
FGT measure was developed by Professor Erik Thorbecke, his former student Professor Joel Greer, and another graduate student at Cornell University at the time, Professor James Foster.
The formula for the FGT is given by:
formula_3
where formula_4 is an agreed upon poverty line (1.25$ or 2$ per day adjusted for purchasing power parity are the two most common poverty lines used by the World Bank. Developed countries usually have much higher poverty lines), formula_5 is the number of people in an economy, formula_6 is the number of poor (those with incomes at or below formula_4), formula_8 are individual incomes and formula_9 is a "sensitivity" parameter. If formula_9 is low then the FGT metric weights all the individuals with incomes below z roughly the same. If formula_9 is high, those with the lowest incomes (farthest below formula_4) are given more weight in the measure. The higher the FGT statistic, the more poverty there is in an economy.
The FGT measure corresponds to other measures of poverty for particular values of formula_9. For formula_14, the formula reduces to
formula_15
which is the Headcount ratio, or the fraction of the population which lives below the poverty line. If formula_16 then the formula is
formula_17
which is the average poverty gap, or the amount of income necessary to bring everyone in poverty right up to the poverty line, divided by total population. This can be thought of as the amount that an average person in the economy would have to contribute in order for poverty to be just barely eliminated.
While the two above versions are widely reported, a good deal of technical literature on poverty uses the formula_18 version of the metric:
formula_19
as in this form, the index combines information on both poverty and income inequality among the poor. Specifically in this instance the FGT can be rewritten as:
formula_20
where formula_21 is the coefficient of variation among those with incomes less than formula_4, formula_6 is the total number of the poor as above, and formula_24 is given by
formula_25.
Other decompositions of the index are also possible.
The formula_26 version of the index was used to allocate inter-regionally funds from the Federal Government in Mexico for educational, health and nutritional programs benefitting the poor. In 2010 the Government of Mexico adopted a multidimensional poverty measure based on a variant of the FGT measure that is to be used in targeting the allocation of social funds to poor households at the municipality level.

Milhouse Van Houten

Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a cartoon character featured in the animated television series "The Simpsons", voiced by Pamela Hayden. He is Bart Simpson's best friend in Mrs. Krabappel's fourth grade class at Springfield Elementary School. He is smart and loyal, but insecure and very gullible, as well as less popular than Bart. He is consistently led into trouble by Bart, who is not shy about taking advantage of his friend's naïve and trusting nature. Milhouse is also a regular target for school bullies Nelson Muntz and Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney. Milhouse is one of the few residents in Springfield with visible, in fact rather thick, eyebrows.
Profile.
Milhouse is of Dutch and Danish descent on his father's side ("Little Orphan Millie"), and Italian and Greek on his mother's side. He has his mother's coloring, but none of her confidence. He has his father's facial features, as well as his father's disappointment, insecurity, and generally depressed demeanor. Milhouse is constantly bullied by Nelson Muntz, Jimbo Jones, Dolph Starbeam, and Kearney Zzyzwicz, to the point of where Bart questions Milhouse by saying "Milhouse! I thought you had a three o'clock wedgie with Nelson", to which Milhouse casually responds "I had to reschedule." They often inflict violence upon Milhouse, who is believed to be a nerd or a geek of some sort. He wears thick eyeglasses and cannot see without them. 
In "Sideshow Bob Roberts", the schoolyard bullies wrapped Milhouse in bumper stickers and placed him in a shopping cart. After Jimbo claimed that "the mummy's ready for his mystical journey!", the bullies pushed the cart with Milhouse down a very steep hill. He is harmed frequently, and on some occasions is injured by dangerous hazards, e.g., being run over by a train, falling down a waterfall, being electrically shocked, having his head polished to bone, having his teeth knocked out by a hockey puck, but, as a lead character, always survives, like Homer Simpson. In "Homer Loves Flanders", Mr. Burns has Milhouse crippled to inspire the local football team by vowing that Milhouse will be harmed more if the team loses. He frequently visited a female psychiatrist until she got so fed up with him that she blocked his number. In "Bye Bye Nerdie", it is implied that Milhouse endured bullying so severe on his first day at Springfield Elementary, that he has to take medication to suppress memories of the incident. 
On one occasion, Bart got Milhouse placed on the FBI's Most Wanted List even though they are friends, and tried to lure Milhouse into a cactus. Milhouse is not always Bart's toy; in "Bart Sells His Soul", Milhouse plays with Bart's anxiety while his pal is fretting to recover his soul. Once, Bart introduced Milhouse to his girlfriend and had to explain why he and Milhouse are friends, but could not come up with a good answer and admitted it is due to geographical convenience. Bart did admit in "Little Orphan Millie" that he loves Milhouse. Bart's father, Homer, enjoys joining in on his son's torment of Milhouse (once referring to him as "that little wiener Milhouse"). In the episode "Burns, Baby Burns", Larry, Mr. Burns' son, brings Homer to eat at his house. Mr. Burns asks Homer if his son "brings home nitwits and make you talk to them", to which Homer answers "Oh, all the time! Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He's a little wiener who..." before being interrupted by Burns. In an attempt to purposefully enrage his father, Bart once stated that he felt "a little attracted to Milhouse", sending Homer into a rage. Bart and Milhouse appear to be the same height but in the episode "Radioactive Man" it is revealed that Milhouse is at least an inch taller than Bart.
He is frequently the butt of a variety of jokes, ranging from being beat up by Nelson for delivering a love note from Lisa (that Nelson thought was from Milhouse himself), to having the door slammed in his face while playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey, to having his possible budding homosexuality given away by his school counselor to Homer and Marge by accidentally picking up the wrong folder while discussing Bart, to making him a wanted fugitive (see above), to inadvertently inheriting Bart's dismal permanent record at school through a side deal arranged between Bart, Edna Krabappel and Principal Skinner, which will disqualify Milhouse from "all but the hottest and noisiest jobs". 
He is fluent in Italian ("The Last of the Red Hat Mamas") due to visiting his English language-hating maternal grandmother, Sofia, in Tuscany for two weeks every year. She beat him whenever he spoke English, thus he was forced to learn Italian (and started to wet his bed) that summer. He helps Lisa learn Italian, but there is no reference to his Italian background or language skills in any other episode. Milhouses' personality drastically changes when speaking Italian, becoming a suave, confident ladies man popular with Springfield's Italian community, this persona is only seen in one episode, but Bart's lack of surprise at his friends' personality shift suggests he often behaves this way.
The shows' opening sequence, and various scenes of band practice suggests that Milhouse plays a brass or woodwind instrument, possibly clarinet or trumpet, but it has been noted that all members of the Springfield Elementary band besides Lisa are very poor performers.
He is allergic to honey, wheat, dairy and non-dairy, mistletoe, holly, the red part of candy canes and his own tears. 
Romance.
Milhouse harbors a hopeless crush on Bart's younger sister, Lisa, but is clumsy around girls. Although he and Lisa do not have a full relationship together, they are close friends, as shown in "Lisa's Date with Density", when she admits she liked Nelson. At the end of that episode, after she has stopped liking Nelson, Milhouse asks Lisa who will be her next crush; Lisa answers that it could be anybody and Milhouse rejoices. Milhouse's feelings for Lisa have been used in episodes set outside of the show's main storyline. For example, the episode "Lisa's Wedding" shows what the future might hold for Springfield in fifteen years' time. Milhouse is Homer's boss at the nuclear plant, and after learning of Lisa's impending marriage, Milhouse recalls an earlier date with Lisa in which she said she might never marry, then angrily prepares Homer's annual review. Later in the episode, Lisa wonders if it is acceptable to wear a white wedding dress, suggesting that she had already lost her virginity; Marge, her mother, tells her "Milhouse doesn't count." In the 2011 future episode "Holidays of Future Passed", Lisa and Milhouse are married and have one daughter, Zia.
Lisa has always opposed the idea of going out with Milhouse (i.e., "Lisa's Date With Density" and "Future-Drama"), however after Milhouse starts tutoring Lisa in Italian and takes her to Springfield's Little Italy, she begins to develop a secret crush on him, until she caught Milhouse with a girl named Angelica in the episode "The Last of the Red Hat Mamas", and began hitting him and cursing in Italian just like his grandmother had done. Milhouse's first girlfriend was Samantha Stanky, a new student who had moved to Springfield from Phoenix, Arizona in the episode "Bart's Friend Falls in Love". After her father caught her and Milhouse kissing, he sent her to a Catholic girls' school run by French-Canadian nuns. While Milhouse's official first kiss was with Samantha Stanky in the aforementioned episode, it was contradicted in the episode "The Way We Weren't", where Milhouse accidentally kisses Homer Simpson during a game of spin the bottle that Homer interrupted. In the episode "Homer Scissorhands", Milhouse dated a 5th grader, Taffy. The relationship ended when Milhouse and Taffy caught Lisa spying on them in the bushes. Taffy told Lisa that Milhouse still loves her, and Lisa then kissed Milhouse. Lisa then told Milhouse he should not give up searching for other girls and that life has unexpected things to offer. She told him he is cute in the moonlight, which caused him to fall off a cliff, but a bald eagle caught him, which left him saying "everything is coming up Milhouse."
Creation.
Milhouse was designed by Matt Groening for a "Butterfinger" commercial, and it was decided to use the character in the series. Milhouse was named after U.S. President Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. The name was the most "unfortunate name Matt Groening could think of for a kid". Years earlier, in a 1986 "Life in Hell" comic entitled "What to Name the Baby", Groening listed Milhouse as a name "no longer recommended". Milhouse is a favorite among the staff as Al Jean noted "most of the writers are more like Milhouse than Bart". His last name was given to him by Howard Gewirtz, a freelance writer who wrote the episode "Homer Defined". Gewirtz got the name from one of his wife's friends.

Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle

Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle (Zone of immaterial pictorial sensibility) is an artist's book and performance by the French artist Yves Klein. The work involved the sale of documentation of ownership of empty space (the Immaterial Zone), taking the form of a cheque, in exchange for gold; if the buyer wished, the piece could then be completed in an elaborate ritual in which the buyer would burn the cheque, and Klein would throw half of the gold into the Seine. The ritual would be performed in the presence of an art critic or distinguished dealer, an art museum director and at least two witnesses.
Between the creation of the piece in 1959 and his death on June 6, 1962, eight "Zones" were sold, of which at least 3 involved the elaborate ritual.
"Klein's receipts verify the existence of an invisible work of art, which prove that a formal sale has taken place. As Klein establishes in his 'Ritual Rules', each buyer has two possibilities; If he pays the amount of gold agreed upon in exchange for a receipt, Klein keeps all of the gold, and the buyer does not really acquire the "authentic immaterial value" of the work. The second possibility is to buy an immaterial zone for gold and then to burn the receipt. Through this act, a perfect, definitive immaterialization is achieved, as well as the absolute inclusion of the buyer in the immaterial... Klein presents capitalist trading strategies and illuminates his ideas about the indefinable, incalculable value of art."
The piece is often seen as an early example of conceptual art.
Origins of the "Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility".
Whilst on a trip to Cascia, Klein had designed an aeromagnetic sculpture, partially as a response to Jean Cocteau's assertion when visiting his exhibition "La forêt d’éponges", June 1959, that it would be even greater if the sponges hovered without supports. Klein's new sculptural idea was to hollow out a sponge, fill it with a hydrogen or helium balloon and a piece of metal, and then place it above a concealed electromagnet to regulate the height at which it would hover. Whilst this idea was never implemented, Klein applied for- and received- a patent on June 30, 1959, and then wrote enthusiastically about this new idea to his dealer Iris Clert, asking her in particular not to mention the invention to her friend, the artist Takis, who had also been experimenting with air sculptures. This led to a serious argument with Clert, who tended to side with Takis, as well as re-opening a previous feud with Jean Tinguely.
"Their disagreement was so strong that Klein had removed all of his art from Clert's gallery in August 1959 and had told her assistant to inform any interested buyers that his paintings were all invisible and that if a buyer wanted one, it would suffice to write a check. He further specified that the check had to be very visible."
Clert then told this anecdote to a number of visitors to her gallery, one of whom, Peppino Palazzoli, an Italian gallerist, expressed an interest in buying an invisible artwork from Klein; in an attempt to repair the friendship, Clert informed Klein of the sale. She also recommended that Klein design a 'proper receipt'. Palazzoli became the official owner of the first "Zone" on November 18 that year, having bought the work for 20 grams of gold, valued at $466.20 as of November 1, 2008 The reunion with Clert was to prove short-lived, however. By the end of 1959, he would sever his affiliation with her gallery, and the "Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility" would be their last collaboration. His next exhibition, the notorious "Anthropométries de l'epoque bleue", March 1960, (featuring models covered in blue paint pressing themselves on to canvases in front of an invited audience of notables) would be held in the considerably more upmarket Galerie Internationale d'Art Contemporain, on the Rive Droite.
The artist's book and Klein's use of gold.
The book took the form of a parody of a banker's chequebook. Klein printed eight books of these receipts of which five survive- apart from the first book (which contained 31 unnumbered checks for an unspecified amount of gold), each book contains 10 numbered receipts for a set value of gold; series one cheques cost 20 grams of gold, series four cost 160 grams. The value of the seventh book's cheques was listed in the "Antagonismes" Exhibition, Paris 1960, at 1,280 grams. 
Any gold that wasn't thrown into the Seine ended up in Klein's concurrent series of Monogolds; large scale works made of gold leaf. He had first come across the material's use in art whilst working in a framing workshop, Robert Savage's, in London 1949-50; he was also to encounter it used in golden Buddhas and screens whilst visiting Japan. Curiously, these encounters led Klein to associate the precious metal with immateriality;
"And the gold, it was something! These leaves that literally fluttered with the least current of air on the flat cushion that one held in one hand, while the other hand caught them in the wind with a knife... What a material!
The illumination of matter in its deep physical quality, I came to embrace it during that year at the 'Savage' frame shop." Klein
The Ritual.
The use of ritual in Klein's work is a theme running through his work, from his exhibition "Le Vide" (The Void) 1958, in which he exhibited invisible works at Clert's gallery flanked by Republican Guards, to his elaborately planned wedding ceremony in 1962 and his votive offering to Saint Rita of Cascia (see [http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_html/1961_B_us.html]). Klein was fascinated by Catholicism & Buddhism, as well as being an enthusiastic member of the archaic group the Knights of the Order of Saint Sebastian.
The obsession with the void, or nothingness, also runs throughout his work, with Le Vide (The Void) being the most famous example; for his second major exhibition at Iris Clert's, he emptied the entire gallery, painted it white (using his patented medium) and then persuaded the French government to send Republican Guards to stand outside as sentries, at the end of a hallway painted ultramarine, covered with blue curtains to ensure there would be no way of anticipating the gallery's contents. Anyone who didn't have an invitation was charged 1,500 frs. entrance fee. It was estimated that between 2,500 and 3,000 people turned up for the opening, and Clert decided to prolong the exhibition for an extra week to accommodate the 'several hundred' visitors each day.
“Having rejected nothingness, I discovered the void. The meaning of the immaterial pictorial zones, extracted from the depth of the void which by that time was of a very material order. Finding it unacceptable to sell these immaterial zones for money, I insisted in exchange for the highest quality of the immaterial, the highest quality of material payment – a bar of pure gold. Incredible as it may seem, I have actually sold a number of these pictorial immaterial states . . . Painting no longer appeared to me to be functionally related to the gaze, since during the blue monochrome period of 1957 I became aware of what I called the pictorial sensibility. This pictorial sensibility exists beyond our being and yet belongs in our sphere. We hold no right of possession over life itself. It is only by the intermediary of our taking possession of sensibility that we are able to purchase life. Sensibility enables us to pursue life to the level of its base material manifestations, in the exchange and barter that are the universe of space, the immense totality of nature.” Yves Klein, from the "Chelsea Hotel Manifesto", 1961
Reception of the Work.
The French press delighted in calling the event 'a scandal' ("Klein Sells Wind!"), but others were more impressed;
Various members of the group present to watch Michael Blankfort's ritual transaction, for instance, on February 10, 1962, concurred that the event was 'extremely awe-inspiring', ending with the noonday chimes ringing out from churches all around Paris. Blankfort, a Hollywood writer, wrote later of having "no other experience in art equal to the depth of feeling of sale ceremony. It evoked in me a shock of self-recognition and an explosion of awareness of time and space."
It has been suggested that the work is a response to Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction", in which he wrote “The unique value of the ‘authentic’ work of art has its basis in ritual, the location of its original use value.” If so, the "Zones" directly refute Benjamin's central argument, that modern mass production can finally "emancipate the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual".
"Believe me, one is not robbed when one buys such paintings; it is I who am always robbed because I accept money." Yves Klein

Museum Van Loon

Museum Van Loon is museum, located in a canalside house alongside the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The museum is named after the family Van Loon that lived in the house from the 19th century.
History.
The canal house where the museum resides was built in 1672, and served as the home of artist Ferdinand Bol. From 1884 to 1945 the Van Loons lived in the house. Thora van Loon-Egidius, who lived in the house, was a lady-in-waiting for Wilhelmina of the Netherlands.
Architecture and collection.
The interior of the house has been renovated, and appears reminiscent of its look in the 18th-century, with wood paneling and stucco work. The upstairs features several paintings of Roman sports figures and a bedroom that is decorated with a Romanticism period painting of Italy. The house also has fake bedroom doors: the 18th-century owners desires to lack symmetry in the interior design so they painted the real bedroom doors to match the walls and fake doors to appear real in a location where one would assume a door would be.

Non-Sky TV customers can access the service by subscribing on a pay-per-view basis. 
Sky Go is viewable on up to two devices, with the ability to increase this to four devices with Sky Go Extra for a monthly fee. The Microsoft Silverlight 3.0 browser plug-in is required to play content on computers. Due to viewing rights, certain programmes are not available to watch via Sky Go, and are 'blacked out' from the schedule. In order to have access to the full selection of live TV channels available on Sky Go, users will need a subscription to the relevant TV packages that correspond to the available channels.
Sky Go has problems playing on any Apple device running Mac OSX 10.7 or higher when playing movies larger than 1000Mb.
History.
On 25 November 2006 Sky announced that Sky By Broadband had been rebranded as Sky Anytime on PC. The rebranding also coincided with an update to the client, which included a new interface and a pay-per-view service for movies and US television shows. On 16 May 2008, Sky Anytime on PC was rebranded as Sky Player, along with updated software to include live simulcasts of Sky News and Sky Sports.
On 29 October 2009, the service expanded on to the Xbox 360. While users do not require a Sky TV subscription, an Xbox Live Gold subscription is required, and users still need to register via the Sky Go website. Features include a party system which allows multiple users to watch content at the same time, with users represented by their Xbox 360 Avatars in a virtual room. Due to the high level of demand, the launch of the service was held back and rolled out to users incrementally over the following days.
On 19 November 2009, Sky Player was also made available to Windows Media Center-equipped Windows 7 computers.
Users of 3G phones on Vodafone, Orange, and T-Mobile could subscribe to Sky Mobile TV. The service consisted of three packages, Sky News, Sport and Factual Pack, Sky Entertainment Pack and Sky Music Pack which include a mixture of live and made for mobile channels of broadcasters channels.
On 6 July 2011, Sky Player and Sky Mobile TV services were merged and rebranded as Sky Go. Key changes include the ability to watch live channels in line with your Sky TV subscription at no additional cost, limited to two simultaneous devices. Support for Windows Media Center was dropped, however an app was released for Apple's iOS operating system, used on the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch. A Sky Go app for Android devices was released on 20 February 2012. Sky Go for Android does not work on rooted phones and was initially only available on a selection of Android phones from HTC and Samsung. On 11 December 2012, Sky Go added support for Jelly Bean and additional devices, including those from Google Nexus, LG and Sony.
, Sky Go is not in development for other platforms such as BlackBerry 10, Windows Phone 8 or Windows RT, as Sky believes that the market is too small to justify the cost of development.
On 22 January 2013, a download service called Sky Go Extra was added, allowing up to four users to download content to their computers, smartphones and tablets to view offline for an additional monthly fee. The download feature was previously available for free in the Sky Go Desktop client.

Utøya

Utøya () is an island in the Tyrifjorden lake in Hole municipality, in the county of Buskerud, Norway. The island is , situated off the shore, by the E16 road, about driving distance south of Hønefoss, and northwest of Oslo city centre.
Overview.
Utøya is owned by the Workers' Youth League ("Arbeidernes ungdomsfylking", AUF), the youth wing of the Labour Party, which holds an annual summer camp there. The island was given as a commemorative gift by Oslo Trade Union Confederation on August 28, 1950, but also serves as a camp site for other events, including other organizations' summer camps. The island is operated commercially by Utøya AS. The island was a croft until purchased by Jens Bratlie in 1893. Bratlie used the property as summer residence until 1933 when it was purchased by Trade Union Confederation. 
The island is largely forested, with some open spaces. A small pier on the east side of the island is used to ferry people to and from Utøykaia on the mainland. There are also permanent buildings. "Hovedhuset" ("The Main House"), "Stabburet" ("The Hórreo"), and "Låven" ("The Barn") are located together near the dock. Up on the hillside ("LO-toppen") are the main campgrounds, the cafeteria building, and the sanitary building. "Skolestua" ("The school house") is located further south.
The name.
The first element "ut" means 'out', or 'outermost'; the last element "øya" is the definite form of "øy", meaning 'island'. Utøya is the southernmost (or farthest "out") island of three which lie in the lake of Tyrifjorden. The name is used in reference to its position in relation to two other islands (lying north of Utøya); "Storøya" (Big Isle) and "Geitøya" (Goat Isle). Storøya is the northernmost, and Geitøya lies between Utøya and Storøya. All of these islands were formerly used for herding (as is shown in the meaning of Geitøya) by the people at Sundvollen. Utøya is quite clearly connected to the name of Utvika on the shoreside.
2011 attack.
On 22 July 2011, a mass shooting took place at the AUF's summer youth camp, where 650 young people were staying. Anders Behring Breivik arrived on Utøya dressed as a police officer and told those on the island that he was there for security reasons following the explosions in Oslo which took place a few hours before. He then began shooting at individuals, continuing until the police arrived one hour after the first alarm call. The suspect immediately surrendered. Combined, the attacks in Oslo and Utøya left 77 dead, with 69 killed on the island, 33 of whom were under the age of 18.
After the attack, several donations were given to AUF for the restoration of the island. Some of the buildings would be demolished, including the cafeteria building where 13 people had been killed. AUF's summer camp in 2012 was held at Bjørkøya (southeast of Brevik in Telemark) under increased security. A ceremony was held at Utøya on the one year anniversary of the attacks, attended among others by Jens Stoltenberg, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and Mona Sahlin. The future of Utøya has been the source of disagreements among the victims and family of the attacks. While AUF's plan is to rebuild and return to Utøya, others want to leave the island as a memorial to the dead.

2008 Vietnam floods

The 2008 Vietnam floods affected north and central Vietnam, as well as southern parts of the People's Republic of China after three days of heavy raining. The rainfall, which began October 30, is the heaviest in 24 years, a state meteorological official told the Vietnam News Agency, and were the worst floods in Hanoi since 1984. At least 66 in Vietnam and 34 in China have been killed because of the flooding. Overall, 15,000 families evacuated their homes, and almost 100 schools, 100,000 houses, 241,000 hectares of crops, and 25,400 hectares of fish farms were submerged or damaged in the floodwaters.
Vietnam.
The floods killed a total of 66 people in Vietnam. In Hanoi, 20, including 3 children, were found dead after 13 more bodies were recovered. Up to one meter of water flooded the city's streets, and transportation was halted. Food prices, especially those of meat and vegetables, reached exorbitant highs in the city, as the rains ruined many crops. Schools were closed on November 3, and damage in Hanoi exceeded 3 trillion Vietnamese đồng ($US 177 million).
Elsewhere in Vietnam, 10 people, including 4 children were killed in Nghệ An Province from the floods. 17 were killed in Hà Tĩnh Province, 4 each in Quảng Ngãi Province and Quảng Bình Province, 3 in Bắc Giang Province, 2 each in Hòa Bình Province, Thái Nguyên Province, and Vĩnh Phúc Province, and 1 each in Ninh Bình Province, Phú Thọ Province, Quảng Nam Province, and Phú Yên Province.

Most roads leading to these areas had been washed away. 1,000 Vietnamese soldiers led rescue work, searching for bodies.
China.
The heavy rains affected southern parts of the People's Republic of China as well, causing mudslides and floods, and killing a total of 34 there. Yunnan Province was hit the hardest, where 26 were killed and 45 remain missing. 8 were killed in Pingguo, Guangxi.

Theatro Lyrico Fluminense

The Theatro Lyrico Fluminense (also spelled as Teatro Lírico Fluminense) was one of the main theatres in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the mid-19th century and was for many years the primary theatre for opera performances in that city. 
When the Theatro São Pedro de Alcântara burned down in 1851, Rio de Janeiro was left without a theatre big enough to host the touring European opera, theatre and dance companies that had been performing in the city since the late 1820s. The city decided to build a new theatre as a matter of urgency. The theatre was originally intended to last for only three years, until the Theatro São Pedro de Alcântara could be rebuilt. Its construction was entrusted to a relatively inexperienced contractor, Vicente Rodrigues, and work began on 29 September 1851. Initially called the Theatro Provisório (the Provisional Theatre), it was completed six months later. The contractor held a masked ball there on 21 February 1852, and on 25 March 1852, the theatre was officially inaugurated with a performance of Verdi's "Macbeth". 
By 1854 the Theatro São Pedro de Alcântara had been rebuilt, but it was decided to keep the Theatro Provisório as well. As the theatre was no longer "provisional", it was officially renamed the Theatro Lyrico Fluminense on 19 May 1854, celebrating with a performance of Verdi's "Ernani". For the next twenty years it was the leading opera house in Rio. The first two operas by Brazil's most famous opera composer, Antônio Carlos Gomes were premiered at the theatre - "A noite do castelo" (1861) and "Joana de Flandres" (1862). In 1871, the theatre saw the Brazilian premiere of Gomes' most famous work, "Il Guarany". In addition to its opera season, the theatre also put on plays and concerts with appearances by performers such as Adelaide Ristori and Sigismond Thalberg.
Located in the Campo da Aclamação, the theatre had a simple neo-classical facade. Its rose painted interior was more elaborate. The ceiling was decorated with portrait medallions honouring various composers and dramatists including Auber, Donizetti, Verdi, Bellini, Meyerbeer, Schiller, and Servandoni. In the center was Rossini surrounded by palm leaves and a laurel wreath. The arena section provided seating for 830 men (514 in seats, and 316 on benches). Seating for women and their escorts was provided by four tiers of boxes built of pine wood. However, the theatre's rapid and faulty construction led to many problems, not the least of which was the fear that it could collapse at any moment. There were also complaints about the poor acoustics and the ever-present dust that plagued the interior. The theatre was remodelled in 1865 when French tapestries and wallpaper, a ceiling fresco, and gas lighting were added. 
Its demise began with the inauguration of the more magnificent Theatro Dom Pedro II in 1871. The Theatro Dom Pedro had better acoustics, a slightly larger seating capacity, and was located in a more fashionable street. The Theatro Lyrico Fluminense gradually went into decline and was demolished on 30 April 1875 to make way for a park.

Jakob Smits

Jakob Smits or Jacob Smits (Rotterdam, 9 July 1855 - Achterbos (Mol), 15 February 1928) was a Dutch-Flemish painter.
Background and early life.
He was born a son of a decorator. Jakob studied in Rotterdam at the academy and helped his father in the decoration business. From 1873 to 1876 he studied at the Academy in Brussels, and after in Munich (1878-1880), Vienna (1880) and Rome (1880). In 1882 Jakob married his cousin Antje Doetje Kramer. They settled in Amsterdam where Smits worked as a painter. He carried out, among other things, tasks for the museum Boijmans-Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. Out of the marriage of Jakob and Antje were produced two children, Theodora and Annie. In 1884, the couple divorced.
Notable achievements and associations.
Jakob Smits moved to Blaricum and in Haarlem becomes director of the "Nijverheids- en Decoratieschool" (E: Industry and Decoration school). He gets to know Albert Neuhuys, a painter of the "The Hague School", and together they make excursions to Drenthe and the Campine in Belgium. Jakob Smits becomes impressed by the Campine landscape and he establishes himself in 1888, definitively in Achterbos (Mol). He pays 2,000 Belgian francs for a small farm which he develops to his "Malvinahof". In the same year he marries Malvina Dedeyn, the daughter of a Brussels lawyer, who is disinherited because of this marriage. Smits lives in poverty while he works tirelessly for what he will call "my simple work, symbolic, poetic and real". In 1897, he received a gold medal for his exhibitions of large water-colour paintings on a gold background in Munich and Dresden. He also paints a lot of portraits, especially of Malvina and of their children Boby, Marguerite and Kobe. In 1899 destiny strikes: in a few days time he loses his daughter Alice and his wife. In 1901, Smits marries with Josine Van Cauteren. In the same year he holds his first individual exposition in Antwerp. There he obtains much praise of colleagues and critics but finds no buyer for his work. The exhibited work "De vader van de veroordeelde" (E: the father of the convict) was acquired later that year by the Museum of Brussels.
Smits financial situation improved somewhat, but his family was put heavily on the test. In 1903 both his parents were ruined by a robbery and as a resulthe now had nine family members to maintain. At the request of the municipal authorities of Mol, Smits in 1907, arranged an international exhibition of artists who came to paint landscapes in Mol and its surroundings. The artist Paula Van Rompa-Zenke belonged to the arranging committee. There were no less than 68 painters participating, with Germans, Dutch, and Americans coming to Mol. The term Molse School was born. In 1910, Smits published an album with 25 engravings, which was dedicated to Queen Elisabeth. In 1912, the young Dirk Baksteen became a student of Smits.
In 1914, Smits stopped with the production of art work. He became President of the "Comité voor hulpverlening en voedselvoorziening van het canton Mol" (E: Committee for assistance and food supplies of the canton Mol). After World War I he continued his work with a totally new vision and style as engrave and painter. As from 1923 his health deteriorated. Smits suffered from a painful cancer of his jaw.
Death and legacy.
On 15 February 1928 he died of a heart disease and he was buried on the church court of Achterbos (Mol). On his sepulchre stands a bronze "Mother and Child" of George Minne. He lies interred with some other members of the Molse School. Jakob Smits who became a Belgian in 1902, was a knight in the Order of Leopold (1903), Officer in the Order of the Crown (1919) and Commander in the Order of the Crown (1927). His wife Josine survived him 28 years and after her dead in 1956 the Malvinahof was sold. In 1977, in the converted old parish of Mol-Sluis the municipal Jakob Smitsmuseum was opened.

The Royal Thai Naval Academy (Thai: โรงเรียนนายเรือ) was established by His Majesty the King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) in 1898. He officially opened the Academy on 20 November 1906. Originally located on the royal yacht Maha Chakri and some other boats donated by H.M. the King, the Academy later moved to Wangderm Palace in Thonburi (in the compound of the present headquarters of the Royal Thai Navy), then to Sattahip, and finally ended up at its current location in Samut Prakan in 1952.
Mission.
The mission of the RTNA is to train future officers for the Royal Thai Navy.
Curriculum.
The RTNA provides undergraduate programs in Engineering and Science, combined with naval professional training. Currently cadets can major in Electrical Engineering, Marine Engineering, Hydrographic Engineering and Management Science and are trained as engineers, navigators and marines.
Graduation.
Cadets graduate with a Bachelor Degree in Engineering or Science and are commissioned in the Royal Thai Navy with the rank of Ensign (Sub-Lieutenant). Together with graduates of the other armed forces and police academies they receive their sword from H.M. the King Bhumibol Adulyadej personally.
Education of Thai Naval Officers.
Young men that want to enter the Academy first have to pass the entrance exam, after which they join a 3-year preparatory program in the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School where they study together with army, airforce and police cadets. On successful completion, they enter the Royal Thai Naval Academy. After graduation, they attend a further one-year advanced course in Sattahip that leads to a Graduate Diploma in Naval Science. On completion of this course, they are ready to work as officers in the Royal Thai Navy.
The Academy also trains police cadets destined to work at the marine police, while every year a few top graduates of the Naval Rating School for non-commissioned officers enter the Academy directly after a separate entrance exam.
Selected first-year cadets of the RTNA are awarded scholarships to study at naval academies abroad. On their return to Thailand they start working as officers in the Royal Thai Navy straightaway.

<doc id="20038207" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20038207" title="Holden Dealer Racing Team">
Holden Dealer Racing Team

The Holden Dealer Racing Team was an Australian motor racing team, covertly backed by General Motors-Holden's through their dealer network so as to get around GM's world wide ban on the company being involved in motorsport. The HDRT contested the 1968 Hardie-Ferodo 500 endurance race at the Mount Panorama Circuit, Bathurst, as well as the 1968 London-Sydney Marathon using GMH's latest car, the Holden Monaro.
Although short-lived, this team was significant as the precursor to a permanent Holden Dealer Team set up the following year which then played a dominant role in Australian touring car racing over the next two decades.
1968 London–Sydney Marathon.
In early 1968, the Holden Dealer Racing Team was set up by David McKay, who already ran the Scuderia Veloce race team in various forms of motor sport in Australia. A motoring journalist with Sydney's "Daily Telegraph" and "Sunday Telegraph" newspapers (both of which were owned by Sir Frank Packer), McKay learned of the upcoming London–Sydney Marathon which was sponsored by race organiser Sir Max Aitken and his UK newspaper, the "Daily Express". The marathon would begin on 24 November in Crystal Palace in London, and finish on 18 December at the Warwick Farm Raceway in Sydney.
McKay convinced his own editor David McNicoll and Telegraph owner Packer to get involved in the event, which they did with co-sponsorship (it reportedly took less than 5 minutes to convince the astute Packer). McKay also convinced GMH to get involved by supplying him with three of the yet to be released Holden Monaro's in which to run in the event. Contrary to popular belief at the time, the Monaros were actually prepared for the 7,000 mi Marathon that would travel through eleven countries by GMH under the supervision of its Sales Director John Bagshaw and chief engineer Bill Steinhagen, and not by Scuderia Veloce. Also, the cars would not be entered under the name of Scuderia Veloce or the Holden Dealer Racing Team, but instead were entered in the event under the name of their major sponsor, The Sydney Telegraph, with the words "Sydney Telegraph Racing" prominently painted on the side of the cars.
While the team did not feature strongly in the results due to mechanical woes, the team's second car driven by leading Australian Rally Championship driver Barry Ferguson finished 12th outright, while the 3rd car driven by triple Australian Grand Prix winner Doug Whiteford finished 14th. The Monaro driven by team leader David McKay failed to finish the marathon.
1968 Hardie-Ferodo 500.
The day following the official launch of the Monaro on the Gold Coast, prominent Melbourne based Holden dealer and former racer Bill Patterson reportedly asked McKay (who was on the Gold Coast covering the cars launch) what it would cost to run three of the new Holden Monaro GTS327's in the 1968 Hardie-Ferodo 500 at Mount Panorama. This led to an agreement being reached where McKay's Scuderia Veloce team, under the name Holden Dealer Racing Team, would run three Monaros which were separately financed by three different Holden dealers, Patterson Motors (Victoria), Midway Motors (Queensland) and Sutton Motors (NSW), with each dealer named on all three cars. The Monaros (not, as rumor had it, the London-Sydney cars) were delivered to the teams base in Wahroonga on Sydney's upper North Shore where they were prepared by Scuderia Veloce chief mechanic Bob Atkins.
Car #23D was driven by international sports car and Formula One racer Paul Hawkins and Bill Brown, #24D was driven by New Zealander Jim Palmer (a Tasman Series regular) and Phil West, while car #25D was driven by 1964 Bathurst 500 winner George Reynolds and veteran touring and sports car driver Brian Muir.
The race was won by the privately entered Monaro of Bruce McPhee and Barry Mulholland. The Palmer/West Monaro finished second outright, with the Muir/Reynolds car in fifth, while the Hawkins/Brown car was disqualified for receiving outside assistance after breaking a wheel in The Cutting. Palmer and West had actually finished 3rd on the road, but the 2nd placed Des West / Ron Marks Monaro was disqualified in post-race scrutineering, lifting the HDRT car to second place.
It was not until the 1969 Datsun Three Hour at Sandown that a permanent Holden Dealer Team, managed by Harry Firth, had its first outing. None of the six Holden Dealer Racing Team drivers from 1968, nor David McKay or Scuderia Veloce were involved in Firth's 1969 Holden Dealer Team campaign.

Hyattsville Historic District

The Hyattsville Historic District is a residential neighborhood comprising a national historic district located in the city of Hyattsville, Prince George's County, Maryland. The district comprises approximately 600 structures, primarily houses, that exhibit late-19th and early-20th century design characteristics. The majority of residential buildings are of frame construction, the older ones with foundations of brick or (rarely) fieldstone, the newer of concrete. The architectural styles represented: grand "mansions," summer cottages, duplexes, Second Empire, Queen Anne, Italianate, Victorian, Bungalow, and Spanish. The area also includes numerous vernacular buildings. The finest concentration of late-19th century structures occur in the area of Farragut, Gallatin, and Hamilton streets and 42nd Avenue. The early-20th century hipped-roof style and bungalows are found throughout the district.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The district was expanded in 2004.

Profile-guided optimization

Profile-guided optimization (PGO) (sometimes pronounced as "pogo", also known as profile-directed feedback PDF) is a compiler optimization technique in computer programming that uses profiling to improve program runtime performance.
Method.
In contrast to traditional optimization techniques that solely use the source code, PGO uses the results of profiling test runs of the instrumented program to optimize the final generated code. The compiler is used to access data from a sample run of the program across a representative input set. The data indicates which areas of the program are executed more frequently, and which areas are executed less frequently. All optimizations benefit from profile-guided feedback because they are less reliant on heuristics when making compilation decisions. The caveat, however, is that the sample of data fed to the program during the profiling stage must be statistically representative of the typical usage scenarios; otherwise, profile-guided feedback has the potential to harm the overall performance of the final build instead of improving it.
Adoption.
There is support for building Firefox using PGO. It is also possible to perform PGO without instrumentation by collecting a profile using hardware performance counters. This sampling-based approach has a much lower overhead and does not require a special compilation.
Implementations.
Examples of compilers that implement PGO are:

1855 Wairarapa earthquake

The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake occurred on 23 January at about 9 p.m. In Wellington, close to the epicenter, shaking lasted for at least 50 seconds. The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to have been in the range 8.1-8.3, the most powerful recorded in New Zealand since systematic European colonisation began in 1840. This earthquake was associated with the largest observed movement on a strike-slip fault, maximum 18 metres. It has been suggested that the surface rupture formed by this event helped influence Charles Lyell to link earthquakes with rapid movement on faults.
Tectonic setting.
New Zealand lies along the boundary between the Australian and Pacific Plates. In the South Island most of the relative displacement between these plates is taken up along a single dextral (right lateral) strike-slip fault with a major reverse component, the Alpine Fault. In the North Island the displacement is mainly taken up along the Kermadec subduction zone, although the remaining dextral strike-slip component of the relative plate motion is accommodated by the North Island Fault System (NIFS). A group of dextral strike-slip structures, known as the Marlborough Fault System, transfer displacement between the mainly transform and convergent type plate boundaries in a complex zone at the northern end of the South Island. The earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault which is part of the NIFS.
Earthquake characteristics.
The earthquake was associated with the rupturing of approximately 150 km of the Wairarapa Fault. A horizontal displacement of up to 18 metres was accompanied by uplift and tilting of the Rimutaka Range on the northwestern side of the fault with vertical offsets of about 6 metres near the fault reducing to almost nothing on the western coast of the Wellington Peninsula. The estimated magnitude of about 8.2 is unusually large for an earthquake associated with movement on a mainly strike-slip fault, and the coseismic offset would have been the largest known for such an event. It has been suggested that this was caused by the rupture propagating down to where the fault links through to the top of the subducting Pacific Plate. Geomorphological evidence, particularly the uplifted beach ridges observed at Turakirae Head, appears to record three previous coseismic uplifts of the Rimutaka Range caused by earthquakes similar in magnitude to the 1855 event, with a recurrence interval of about 2200 years.
Damage.
Wellington experienced severe shaking but the resulting damage was reduced as the city had been extensively rebuilt following the 1848 Marlborough earthquake using mainly wooden structures; only one person was known to have died. In the surrounding countryside at least another four people (possibly as many as eight) were reported to have died during the earthquake. Numerous landslides were reported along the slopes of the Rimutaka Range. Minor damage was recorded in places as far away as Lyttelton and Christchurch.
The uplift of the northwestern side of Wellington Bay rendered many of the jetties in the harbour unusable, although this new area of land provided an excellent new rail and road route to the north.
Tsunami.
The earthquake generated New Zealand’s largest historical locally-generated tsunami, with a maximum run-up of 10-11 m.
New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research created an animated tsunami simulation model based on the 1855 Wairarapa event, which was screened on the television tele-drama "Aftershock"

Her Big Chance

Her Last Chance is a dramatic monologue written by Alan Bennett in 1987 for television, as part of his Talking Heads series for the BBC. The series became very popular, moving onto BBC Radio, international theatre, becoming one of the best-selling audio book releases of all time and included as part of both the A-level and GCSE English syllabus. It was the fifth episode of the first series of Talking Heads.
Storyline.
Lesley (Julie Walters) is an aspiring actress, who, after a series of unpromising extra roles on television programmes such as Crossroads, finds what she believes to be her big break as the adventurous Travis in a new film for the West German market.

Landy Field, Geelong

John Landy Field Recreation Reserve is situated at the corner of Swanston Street and Barwon Terrace, South Geelong and was formerly known as Riverside Reserve. It sits adjacent to the Barwon River to the south and the Godfrey Hirst Pty Ltd carpet factory to the east.
Landy Field became a project of the Geelong Guild Athletic Club in the late 1950s. At the conclusion of the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, the Geelong City Council held a dinner on 15 January 1957 to honour the six Geelong Guild athletes (Ron Blackney, John Chittick, Robert James "Bob" Joyce, John Landy, Don MacMillan and John Vernon) who had represented Geelong and Australia at these games. During the dinner, where most of the neighbouring Cities and Shires were represented, John Landy made a speech on behalf of the honoured athletes, in which Landy compared overseas facilities available to athletes to those of Australia. Geelong, at that stage had no dediacted athletic field of any kind.
To confirm a proper management structure of Landy Field (Riverside Reserve) the Geelong City Council entered into an agreement with the Geelong Guild Athletic Club Trustees (Bervin E. Purnell: President, Rudi Hochreiter Snr: Secretary, Wal Whiteside: Construction Engineer and Charles Harding: Committee Member). This agreement was confirmed on 6 January 1961 and thus allowed for the construction of Landy Field to commence.
Finance.
Surrounding Geelong municipalities and shires contributed $2,550.00 whilst the Geelong Guild Athletic Club donated $3,989.80 towards the construction of Landy Field. Most of the Guild money came from its life savings since the clubs founding on 13 July 1908.
