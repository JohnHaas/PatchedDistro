History of Puerto Rico Islanders FC

This articles details the History of the Puerto Rico Islanders. The Puerto Rico Islanders are a professional association football team based in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. Founded in 2003, the team plays in the North American Soccer League (NASL), the second tier of the American soccer pyramid.
USISL.
In 1995, a team called the Puerto Rico Islanders joined the USISL, now the United Soccer Leagues (USL), was founded by Joe Serralta, his wife Rosa Serralta and his son Joey Serralta prompted by Joey Serralta's proposal to his father while Joey Serralta was playing in the USISL with the Charlotte Eagles in 1994 of starting a professional soccer team in the USISL in his homeland. The team played only 7 games before the Serralta family decided to move the franchise to Houston, Texas on June 1, changing its name to the Houston Force, due to problems with the Puerto Rican Football Federation. In 1996 Joey Serralta would become the owner and president of the Houston Hurricanes F.C. while Joe Serralta, Sr. would bring the Islanders back to the island to play on a local basis.
Early years (2003-2005).
Eight year after Serralta's first attempt at professional football, he gave it another go and together with a group of Puerto Rican businessmen officially created the current incarnation of the Puerto Rico Islanders. The team played their first A-League season, now the USL First Division, in 2004. The original squad was composed of a large number of local Puerto Rican players and a contingency of foreign players composed of Americans, Brazilians, Salvadoran and Argentines completed this first squad, the team was coached by Brazilian Vitor Hugo Barros who was replaced several games into the season by Argentine Hugo Hernán Maradona, brother of the legendary Diego Armando Maradona. The team played its first league game on April 17, 2004 against the Toronto Lynx at the Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium, the Islanders lost 1-0 in front of a reported 6,000 fans. The Islanders had their first victory on January 15, 2004 against the Charleston Battery with a score of 1-0 at the Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium. Led by players like Mauricio Salles, Raúl Díaz Arce and Luis Fernando Zuleta Mechura the Islanders finished the 2004 season in 14th place, with a record of 5 wins, 17 losses and 6 ties.
In 2005, the Islanders still under Hugo Hernán Maradona brought in a new group of players that would become staples in the club for the next couple of seasons (Petter Villegas, Marco Vélez, Dan Kennedy, Caleb Norkus, Alejandro González Pareja and Noah Delgado), and retained several key players like Mauricio Salles. At the end of the season, the Islanders had an improved season record with 10 wins, 10 losses and 8 ties, this time barely missing the playoff.
2006 Season.
The Islanders opened their 2006 season with a mix of new players like Argentine Gustavo Barros-Schelotto, Chilean Arturo Norambuena, Canadian Alen Marcina, and homegrown talent Marco Vélez, Alexis Rivera, Rafael Ortiz Huertas, and American Dan Kennedy to create one of the strongest lineups in the club's short history, in a serious attempt to take the USL Div. 1 title for the first time.
Formed under the management of then head coach Jorge Alvial, the 2006 Islanders had a record of 3-2-1 up to early June, whene Alvial put in his resignation to become a scout for the English club Chelsea. The club lumbered across the last half of the season barely making the playoffs, under the new head coach Toribio Rojas, Jorge Alvial's assistant coach, finishing the season in 6th place and with a record of 10-8-10.
In the weekend before the 2006 playoffs, the Islanders hosted Miami FC twice, who had Brazilians Romário and Zinho in their line up. The Islanders needed four points to qualify for the Playoffs. After going down 0:2 in the first half the Islanders managed to come back and win 4:2 in front of 8,600.
In the final game of the season against Miami on September 10, 2006, they attracted a record crowd of nearly 11,000 fans. Early in the second half Miami took the lead. It wasn't until the 43rd minute of the second half that the Islanders equalized with an Arturo Norambuena penalty. A draw was sufficient for the Islanders to qualify in front of Seattle and Atlanta.
In the first round of the playoffs, the team played a home-away series against the Charleston Battery. Unfortunately for the Islanders, Charleston won the series 3:2, ending the 2006 season for the Puerto Ricans.
2007 season.
The team came into the season on a high, they had just played a preseason tournament against MLS teams and achieved very successful results. They also had signed several dangerous players like Panamanian trio Victor Herrera, a Panamanian international, Gustavo Avila, and Alberto Zapata, a new goalkeeper Josh Saunders, rookie Jay Needham The Force folded after one game in Houston., plus a return of players like Marco Vélez, Petter Villegas and Noah Delgado. The squad was considered serious contenders for the title.
After one early success, the team took a turn for the worse. It was evident that Toribio Rojas had lost his edge and after an embarrassing 2:1 lost against bottom table Minnesota Thunder was let go from his coaching position and given the post of Youth System Director, when he left the team with a record of 1-3-3. Also attendance went down.
The FO quickly found a replacement in ex-FC Dallas coach Colin Clarke, who had found himself without a job after the debacle of the Virginia Beach Mariners. He immediately established himself as a hard and hotheaded coach. Because of the way he conducted the teams practice, he was given the nickname of "El General", because he worked the team like a general would with his troops.
The rapid change was also seen on the field, in the first game under Clark the team beat the Minnesota Thunder 2:1, just a week after it had lost against them. Clark and the Islanders turned around, even with some bad roster decisions by Clark in American Jared Montz and Jamaican Gregory Simmonds, he redeemed himself by signing players like Haitian Fabrice Noel, Englishman Taiwo Atieno and bringing Willie Sims on loan from the New England Revolution. These players had a positive impact on the squad and the team ended comfortably in 6th place, two spots on top of the last playoff spot.
The Islanders went into the playoffs with an air of confidence but facing powerhouse Montreal, passing the quarterfinals seemed very difficult. After a 2:3 lost in Montreal, the team came back at home with the 3:0 victory, winning the series 5:3. In the semifinals, the team faced the same problem but now against regular season champions Seattle Sounders. The Islanders lost at home but managed to tie the series in Seattle, losing the series 4-2 in penalties.
2008 season.
On June 16, 2008, Jonathan Steele was included in the USL's "All-Star Week Players" list. On June 27, 2008, the Islanders defeated the Minnesota Thunder with a score of 1-0. Two days later, they won the second game of the series 3-1. The Islanders began gaining more points in the second half of June and early July, earning a total of 24 points, positioning themselves in the second position of the league's global standing. On July 18, 2008, the Islanders defeated the Carolina RailHawks, reaching the second place of the league's standings. On July 27, 2008, the team closed a road trip with a 3-2 victory against Minnesota Thunder, securing their position. On August 8, 2008, the Islanders defeated Rochester Rhinos four goals to none. This victory placed the team in the top of the league's standing for the first time in the club's history. After tying with Rochester two days later, the team shared the position with the Vancouver Whitecaps. In the final stages of the tournament, the Islanders regained the first position and on September 19, they won the first Commissioner's Cup since their creation, clinching the first place in the league's regular season. The Puerto Rico Islanders became the first team of the USL league to win 4 individual honors from a total of 5; this includes Goalkeeper of the Year (Bill Gaudette), Most Valuable Player (Jonathan Steele), Defense of the Year (Cristian Arrieta) and Head Coach of the Year (Colin "General" Clarke). Islanders would go on to the USL 1 Division final in Vancouver and lose to the Whitecaps 2:1, in the team's first final.

Ghost Rider (short film)

Ghost Rider is a US short film on bus safety, shown primarily in schools in the 1980s.
Plot.
"Review by Eric Petersen, Internet Archive:"
Kevin (Doug Edmunds) is the sad and lonely new kid in town. After enduring his first day of junior high school, Kevin is befriended on the bus ride home by a sweet girl (Wendy Taylor) who offers him a sympathetic ear. She drops her pencil and Kevin picks it up, only to find that the girl has vanished. Her name is inscribed on the pencil - Tracy Donnelly.
The next time Kevin sees Tracy on the bus, she gives him a bus safety manual and begs him to read it. The other kids wonder who he's talking to. Then Kevin finds out that Tracy is a ghost. She died in a bus accident, and what's more, she used to live in the same house as Kevin.
The bus safety manual goes unread, so an invisible Tracy haunts Kevin at home while he's working out. Through some nicely done special effects, she moves his weights around and floats the manual over to him. Finally, he agrees to read it.
The next time Kevin sees Tracy on the bus, she explains that she never read the bus safety manual, so she didn't know what do to save herself and others when the time came. Then, suddenly, a pickup truck strikes Kevin's bus, knocking out the driver and sending the bus hurtling off the road and dangling over the edge of a cliff.
Remembering what he'd read, (and with some coaching from Tracy) Kevin gets all the kids safely off the bus. Then he revives the driver and gets him out. The bus plunges off the cliff and crashes. Kevin is a hero, the kids cheer him, but he's forgotten about Tracy.
Refusing to believe that Tracy went down with the bus, Kevin scours the area. Finally, she calls out to him. He sees her, she waves him a sad goodbye, and vanishes, fading away before his eyes. Kevin is heartbroken.
Cult film.
With its supernatural/love story plotline, highly unusual for a short film designed to be shown to middle and high school students, "Ghost Rider" has become something of a cult item in the three decades since it was made. The film gained more attention with its inclusion in the "A/V Geeks" section of the Internet Archive's Moving Pictures Archive ; both star Edmunds and writer-director Ungar posted messages on the board, relaying their experiences on making the film. The movie has been downloaded from the archive over 22,000 times as of February 2014. (In the fall of 2010, AV Geeks founder Skip Elsheimer had Edmunds do a voice-over narration of the film for a bus safety video compilation he curated for Kino, which remains unreleased.)
Doug Edmunds has never appeared in another film (nor have any of the other actors, including co-star Wendy Taylor), but Edmunds wound in show business anyway, as a musician. He co-founded the power-pop band the Gladhands, which released three well-received albums in the 1990s,

<doc id="19865962" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19865962" title="Gold clause">
Gold clause

Gold clauses specified within business contracts allow the creditor the option to receive payment in gold or gold equivalent. A gold clause may prove valuable to the creditor in long term contracts, wherein questions may arise as to whether a currency in use at the time the contract was entered into would still have the same value when payment is due. Creditor concerns in respect to inflation, war, changes in government, and any other uncertainty about the future value of currency would be common reasons for adopting a gold clause within a contract.
These clauses were common at the beginning of the 20th century. However, their use in the United States was invalidated by the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. Congress later reinstated their use for obligations (new contracts) issued after October 1977 in accordance with (d)(2).
On August 27, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the enforceability of such clauses in the decision "Jamaica Avenue, LLC vs S&R Playhouse Realty Co.".

The Narrows, St. John's

The Narrows, the only entrance to St. John's Harbour, Newfoundland, is a narrow channel between the Southside and Signal hills. It has a least depth of 11 metres and at its narrowest point near Chain Rock is 61 metres wide. 
The Narrows has served an important defence of the city of St. John’s from early pirates and settlers in 1655 to World War II. In 1655 vice admiral Christopher Martin erected a fort on the south side to prevent privateers and enemy vessels from entering the port. In 1763 Fort Amherst was built in the same area. In the late 18th century a defensive chain was erected across the narrows from Chain Rock to Pancake Rock which could be raised in the event of enemy ships advancing into the harbour. During World War II a steel mesh was installed to prevent enemy submarines from entering the harbour.

Ad rotation

Ad rotation is the practice of showing multiple advertisements in a single location on a web page. Ads may be rotated with each new page load, within a single page load, or both. Because the ads are placed in the same location, they are typically the same format.
The goals of ad rotation include:
Ad rotation software, known as ad rotators, commonly provide features such as the following:
Technical implementation.
Technically, ad rotation can be accomplished in multiple ways. The three most common approaches are server-side, client-side and service-based.
With server-side ad rotation, the ad is selected on the server and the corresponding HTML markup is generated and then served.
Client-side ad rotation typically involves JavaScript of some sort (either straight client-side JavaScript or else AJAX calls to the server.
Service-based ad rotation is similar to client-side ad rotation in that it typically involves placing a small amount of JavaScript in the web page, but the JavaScript calls against a third-party service that provides its own management interface for specifying ad delivery options. Google's AdSense service is an example of service-based ad rotation.

Collaborative for High Performance Schools

The Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS) is the United States' first green building rating program especially designed for K-12 schools. CHPS provides information and resources to schools in order to facilitate the construction and operation of high performance institutions. A high performance school is energy and resource efficient as well as healthy, comfortable, well lit, and containing the amenities for a quality education.
History and organization.
CHPS was created as the result of a meeting in November 1999, when the California Energy Commission called together Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Sempra Energy, and Southern California Edison to discuss how to improve the energy performance of California’s schools. CHPS addresses not only energy efficiency, but additional considerations that foster healthy and environmentally responsible school buildings. The CHPS criteria, published in 2002, established the nation’s first building rating program specifically intended to assist schools in designing sound, environmentally responsible learning spaces.
Now, CHPS is a national membership organization with two high performance building rating and recognition programs: CHPS Designed and CHPS Verified. Schools can self-certify their building through the CHPS Designed program, or seek third-party verification of their high performance school through the CHPS Verified program. Both programs utilize the CHPS guidelines provided in the Best Practices Manual, a six volume technical manual detailing the process of building and maintaining a high performance school. In addition, CHPS offers training, conferences, and other tools for designing healthy, green schools. The CHPS Low-Emitting Materials table contains products that have been certified to meet the CHPS Low-Emitting Materials criteria, Section 01350, for use in a typical classroom as described in a California Department of Health Services (CDHS) Standard Practice. The CHPS Low-Emitting Materials table is referenced in the California Green Building Code and in the Minnesota Sustainable Building Guidelines.
CHPS membership is composed of over 225 member organizations including government agencies, utility companies, school districts, non-profit organizations and private companies. While the program started in California, it has now expanded to other states, including New York, Washington, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, and Connecticut. Soon, Texas and Colorado will also adopt CHPS standards. CHPS School Districts include Los Angeles Unified School District, Burbank Unified School District, Coast Community College District, Dry Creek Joint Elementary School District, San Diego Unified School District, San Francisco Unified School District, San Marcos Unified School District, San Rafael City Schools, Visalia Unified School District, Natomas Unified School District, New Haven Unified School District, Ukiah Unified School District, Cajon Valley Union School District, Poway Unified School District, Palo Alto Unified School District, Oakland Unified School District, Roseland School District, Menlo Park City School District, Santa Ana Unified School District, West Contra Costa Unified School District, Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District, Long Beach Unified School District, Capistrano Unified School District, and Windsor Unified School District. The CHPS Board of Directors and Technical Committee consist of national representatives from a range of sectors involved in school design, construction and operation.
High performance schools.
High performance schools are healthy, comfortable, energy efficient, resource efficient, water efficient, safe, secure, adaptable, and easy to operate and maintain. These qualities help school districts assist students to achieve higher test scores, retain quality teachers and staff, reduce operating cost, increase average daily attendance, and reduce liability, while at the same time being friendly to the environment. High performance design can have a positive effect on health and comfort, and design strategies such as daylighting have been shown to enhance student learning. Good indoor air quality is essential for teacher and student health. Good design also produces more comfortable environments with proper lighting, air temperature, humidity, and noise levels. These factors reduce distractions and create environments where students and teachers can see clearly, hear accurately, and not feel too warm or too cold.
High performance design is also cost effective because it creates environments that are energy and resource efficient. These increased efficiencies save money on utility bills and are so valuable that some organizations will provide building owners with funds to have them included in the design. Furthermore, healthier environments can bring money into the school by lowering absenteeism and increasing funding based on average daily attendance. These financial, health, and productivity benefits are the result of integrated design: understanding how building elements affect one another to optimize the performance of the entire school.
On June 4, 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the "21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act," that commits over $20 billion of funding over the next five years to high performance schools. CHPS is recognized as one of the standards that projects would need to meet in order to qualify for the H.R. 3021 legislation funding. H.R. 3021 was referred to the Senate on August 1, 2008.
CHPS Best Practices Manual.
The CHPS Best Practices Manual is a six-volume technical guide for high performance schools. The manual covers planning, design, high performance benchmarks, maintenance and operations, commissioning and relocatable classrooms in high performance schools. There are versions of the Criteria Volume available for all participating states. There are versions of the Planning Volume available for California and Massachusetts. The manual was developed through a consensus process with the assistance of school officials, state agencies, industry representatives and design professionals. CHPS periodically updates each volume of the manual.

Victoria Road Prison

"This article is about the former Isle of Man Prison located in Douglas. For the new Isle of Man Prison in Jurby, see Isle of Man Prison"
Victoria Road Prison is a former prison that was located on Victoria Road in Douglas, capital of the Isle of Man. Victoria Road Prison was the first purpose-built prison to be constructed on the Isle of Man, and held prisoners from April 1891 to August 2008.
History.
From 1780 prisoners from the Isle of Man (including debtors) mainly served their sentence at Castle Rushen, but within a century problems were apparent with this arrangement. Prisoners would grow unruly, as they could not be separated, and the conditions in which they were kept were unfit. When the Chairman of the Commissioners for Prisons in England and Wales inspected the premises for the first time in 1885, he indicated a need for a prison to house 30 prisoners. His recommendation was not universally popular in Tynwald, as some did not want to spend the money, but nevertheless Manx architect James Cowle was employed to design a new prison, which was subsequently constructed at Victoria Road in Douglas. The entire prison population of the Isle of Man was transferred to the new Victoria Road Gaol in April 1891.
At the beginning of the 20th Century Victoria Road Prison received a glowing report from Major Darnell, the HM Inspector of Prisons:
The present accommodation consists of 21 cells in the male and eight cells in the female prison. The cells are light and airy, and well ventilated and compare quite favourably with those in the best English prisons — boarded floors, clear glass in the windows and external gas boxes. They were uniformly clean and well kept. 
As the population of both Island and prison grew, the prison was expanded, with the addition of two new wings in 1989. One of these, C wing, was assigned to young prisoners between the ages of 17 and 21, with a maximum accommodation of 37 prisoners spread between 19 single cells and 2 dormitories. Later, the dormitories were altered to serve as a dining room and exercise room, and the single rooms reassigned to adults. The other wing, D, was designed to hold 15 female prisoners in 5 single cells and 2 dormitories, though the maximum number of places permitted was then reduced to 11.
In spite of the expansion, criticism mounted over overcrowding and human rights issues until in July 2005, Tynwald backed the construction of a new, larger secure facility at Jurby that would be better outfitted to rehabilitate prisoners. The new Isle of Man Prison was opened in August 2008 when all inmates from Victoria Road were transferred to the new prison. A month later, the Home affairs Minister Adrian Earnshaw MHK signed the paperwork which revoked the Custody Act 1995, which designated the building as a gaol, bringing Victoria Roads' active use as a prison to a close after period of 117 years.
Immediately after the decommissioning of Victoria Road Prison, the building was opened up for public tours during September and October 2008. Former acting prison governor Tony Hawkes who retired in June 2008 after 34 years' service lead the tours of the prison which included a visit to various wings and cells, as well as the search room and segregation unit. The tours were extremely popular, with places being fully booked within just hours of being advertised. Public interest in the old prison led to calls to open up the Victoria Road site as a permanent visitor attraction over the summer months.
In May 2010, the exercise yard of the former prison was used for an 'Urban Street Sport' event. The event included football skills competitions and demonstrations of free running. In June 2010, it was announced that artefacts from the former gaol sold in a public auction had raised £8,800. A month later, the former prison was used as a set location for the British horror film "Slasher House".
The prison today.
In October 2010, the Department of Home Affairs applied for planning permission to demolish Victoria Road Prison. The department cited a survey which indicated that parts of the gatehouse and cell blocks of the former prison had deteriorated so that public access could not be allowed. However, in January 2011 it emerged that the Isle of Man Government was considering listing the former gaol on a register of buildings of "special architectural or historic interest", meaning that it would be saved from demolition.
The buildings continue to lay unoccupied or demolished. In January 2012, Tim Crookall MHK suggested that there were concerns that listing some of the buildings of the former prison could prevent the site from being redeveloped for other uses. In November 2012, the Department of Home Affairs confirmed that demolition works had started at the former prison site, with completion planned for March 2013. As yet it is not known what will replace the former prison buildings.

<doc id="19866441" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19866441" title="Looting of Battleford">
Looting of Battleford

The Looting of Battleford began at the end of March, 1885, during the North-West Rebellion, in the town of Battleford, Saskatchewan, then a part of the Northwest Territories.
Within days of the Métis victory at the Battle of Duck Lake on March 26, 1885 Cree bands sympathetic to the Métis cause and with grievances of their own began raiding stores and farms in the western part of the District of Saskatchewan for arms, ammunition and food supplies while civilians fled to the larger settlements and forts of the North-West Territories. 
Prominent leaders of this uprising were Chief Poundmaker and Chief Big Bear. Poundmaker and his band had a reserve near Cut Knife about 50 km (31 miles) west of Fort Battleford. Big Bear and his band had settled near Frog Lake about 55 km (34 miles) northwest of Fort Pitt but had not yet selected a reserve site. Both bands were signatories of Treaty 6 and were unhappy in the way it was implemented by the Canadian government. The loss of the buffalo and the inadequate rations provided by the Indian agents kept the bands in a continual state of near-starvation. 
Geography.
The District of Saskatchewan in 1885 was divided into three sub-districts and had a population of 10,595. To the east the Carrot River sub-district with 1,770 people remained quiet. The Prince Albert sub-district (also called Lorne) located in the centre of the district had a population of 5,373 which included the Southbranch settlements with about 1,300. The Southbranch settlements was the centre of Louis Riel's Provisional Government during the Rebellion. To the west where the Cree uprising led by Poundmaker and Big Bear occurred was the Battleford sub-district with 3,603 people. 
The largest settlement and the capital of the district was Prince Albert with about 800 people followed by Battleford with about 500 people "divided about equally between French, Métis and English".
Battleford is located on the Battle River near the North Saskatchewan River. On the south side of the Battle River was the Old Town and on the north side nearest the North Saskatchewan River was the New Town and Fort Battleford.
The city of North Battleford was founded later in 1905 when the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway main line to Edmonton placed the line on the north side of the North Saskatchewan River.
Siege of Battleford.
On March 28 as news that several Indian bands including Poundmaker's were on their way to Battleford settlers began moving into the nearby North-West Mounted Police post, Fort Battleford which was under the command of Colonel Morris and 25 police. Over the next several days 500 civilians would take refuge within the palisades. Many crossed over an unstable ice bridge on the Battle River leaving most of their possessions behind in the Old Town. During the night of March 29 nearby homesteads were raided their horses and cattle rounded up by the bands.
Also on the trail to join Poundmaker in Battleford were the Assiniboine from the Eagle Hills approximately 30 km south of Battleford. On March 29 they killed their farm instructor John Payne and raided homesteads on the way killing a farmer by the name of Fremont. 
On March 30 Poundmaker asked for a meeting with the Indian agent J. M. Rae. 
After Rae refused to meet with him the combined Battleford bands took food and supplies from the abandoned stores and houses. The next day the bands camped a few miles away bringing with them their looted provisions including cattle and horses then eventually returned to Poundmaker's reserve.
While the New Town was protected by its proximity to the Fort and its cannon the Old Town was not. Every day until the arrival of Colonel Otter's column on April 24 the occupants of the Fort watched as the Old Town about a mile away was plundered. Stolen vehicles and horses carried away the supplies of the Hudson's Bay Company and the other merchants. All the public buildings were sacked including the Indian Industrial School (the Old Government House). Most homes were burned including the imposing home of Judge Rouleau. Just half a dozen were left standing. 
Aftermath.
On May 2 Colonel Otter's column attacked Poundmaker's camp at Cut Knife Creek but was forced to retreat to Battleford. Poundmaker prevented his warriors from attacking the retreating troops.
On May 14 at Eagle Hills a Battleford band captured a wagon train carrying supplies for Colonel Otter's column. 
After the defeat of the Métis force at the Battle of Batoche and the surrender of Louis Riel to Middleton on May 15 Pitikwahanapiwiyin (Poundmaker) surrendered to General Middleton at Fort Battleford on May 26.
Overview.
The nature of the Cree advance on Battleford, like the entire 1885 Rebellion, is a source of historiographical controversy. Historian Douglas Hill characterized the Cree group as a "war party... ready to take revenge for a winter of incalculable suffering" who "swooped on Battleford, killing six whites". George F.G. Stanley's writing on the subject indicated that the Cree were not murderous but more haphazard and bumbling: they " not appear to have in mind an attack upon the town" but were content with "prowling around the neighbourhood." While John L. Tobias says that the Crees tried to demonstrate their "peaceful intent" by including women and children in their group, simply took food to sustain themselves after finding the town abandoned, and then withdrew to avoid conflict with the police.

Bristol Mountain Ski Resort

Bristol Mountain Ski Resort, also known as Bristol Mountain Winter Resort, is a ski resort located in South Bristol, New York in the Finger Lakes region. It is located from the center of Rochester, New York, the nearest major city to the resort, and about from Canandaigua on State Route 64. Currently, Bristol Mountain Resort features many trails ranging from easiest (green circle) to difficult (double black diamonds). Bristol Mountain has a vertical rise of 1,200 feet, claiming to have the highest vertical of any ski resort between the Rocky Mountains and the Adirondacks. Bristol also offers two terrain parks and cross country skiing at the resort's summit. Also at the bottom is a ski shop and rental facility. Bristol Mountain Resort also operates in conjunction with Roseland Waterpark, open during the summer season in Canandaigua. As of 2010, they have two high speed detachable chairlifts. The Comet Express lift was installed for the 1999/2000 season and the Galaxy Express for the 2009/2010 season. Both make a full pass in about four minutes. In the autumn they offer Fall Sky Rides using the Comet Express High Speed Quad chairlift slowed down to take 15–20 minutes. Once at the top the riders may stay on and ride or hike down the trails.
History.
Bristol Mountain was established in 1964 after the land was bought in South Bristol, New York. 50 of was cleared, the base lodge built for the December 12 opening. All this while Wade was just a little wise guy pipsqueak. Snowmaking capabilities and a new lift was added in 1965. In 1967, then Senator Robert Kennedy skied at Bristol. In 1968 Bristol Mountain was the world's largest illuminated ski resort. By the 1970s, Bristol was getting over 100,000 skiers per year and opened seven days a week. They progressively made snowmaking improvements and by 1985 they had 100 percent coverage and guaranteed over 100 days of skiing per season.
In 1969 the rate for skiing was seven dollars, with four dollar nights. Even then they had the longest vertical drop between the Adirondacks and the Rockies. However, back then they only claimed the drop to be 1,000 instead of 1,200 feet. Surprisingly, they were open later then, closing at 10:30 instead of 10:00.
In 2009–2010, the new high speed detachable chairlift (Galaxy Express High Speed Quad) was added. A new trail, "Lower North Star", which ends at the bottom of the Galaxy chairlift was added for the 2010–2011 season. The new lift replaces an older, non-detachable, lift that started halfway up the mountain in the same place. The new trail is 2,600 feet long and 120 feet wide, adding a little over seven acres to the mountain.
Rural Radio Network.
The summit of Bristol Mountain has been a broadcasting site for the Rural Radio Network since 1948, before the ski resort was ever formed. The station now known as WQBW signed on June 6, 1948 as WVBT, licensed to Bristol Center, New York and transmitting from Bristol Mountain on 101.9 MHz. It was the next-to-last link in the Rural Radio Network chain of FM stations broadcasting to farmers across upstate New York. WVBT changed call letters to WRRE and changed frequency to 95.1 in the early 1950s. When the Rural Radio Network became the Ivy Network under new owners in 1960, WRRE became WMIV. It would retain those calls under the network's next identity, the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), broadcasting religious programming from studios in Ithaca between 1968 and 1981. WMIV was sold to Empire Broadcasting and in early 1982, it changed format to adult standards and its call letters to WYLF. This station operated from a studio in a converted house on Route 332 in Farmington. On July 28, 1986, WYLF was sold and became WZSH. On December 26, 1991, WZSH became WRQI, "Rock-It 95," programming a rock format. In 1993, Rock-It 95 added the syndicated "Howard Stern Show" to its lineup, bringing the station attention and ratings in the larger Rochester market. WRQI made several attempts to improve its main signal on 95.1 as well, briefly moving from its historic Bristol Mountain site to a tower in Farmington owned by Rochester Telephone Company, but was forced to return to Bristol after interference complaints from the tower's neighbors. On April 21, 1995, WRQI became WNVE, "The Nerve," a modern rock/alternative station. In 2001, WNVE left its Bristol Mountain transmitter site for the last time, changing city of license from South Bristol to Honeoye Falls, New York in a swap with sister station WLCL (107.3), which took the South Bristol city of license and the Bristol Mountain transmitter site. On July 4, 2004, Clear Channel moved WNVE from 95.1 to the lesser Bristol Mountain 107.3 signal. Replacing it on 95.1 was the former 107.3 classic rock format, "The Fox," with new call letters WFXF. The Bristol Mountain station now broadcasts on 107.3 as oldies WODX.
Statistics.
While Bristol is often claimed to have had 160 skiable acres, Bristol states that with the addition of the latest trail they are up to 138 skiable acres. 160 is probably the total cleared acreage, including the summit and base area. Bristol's new detachable chairlift, the Galaxy high speed quad, will only run during peak times such as afternoons and weekends. Bristol Mountain usually has a winter operating season of about four months (December to March), sometimes opening by late November and closing sometime in April. Early and late in the season only a few trails and lifts are open. In 2010, they opened on December 5, but only the Comet Express lift was running and only Rocket Run was open, from noon to four pm.
Trails: 34; 33% Novice; 49% Intermediate; 18% Advanced 
Chairlifts: 5 total, including two high speed detachable chairlifts. There is also a conveyor surface lift to a beginner slope known as Launching Pad which only rises 60 feet
Surface Lifts
Vertical: 
Summit elevation: 
Skiable Acres: 160
Average Annual Snowfall: 120 inches
Night Skiing: 96% of the trails have trail lighting
Snowmaking: 97% of terrain has snowmaking capabilities (all trails except Quantum Leap)
Trails.
Bristol Mountain Ski Resort has 34 slopes and trails, including two terrain parks and two half-pipes. The Morning Star park features a half-pipe 450’ long with 14’ high walls. The easier Shooting Star Progression Park includes a 100' half-pipe with 3–4' walls made out of snow instead of earth. The longest trail/run is about two miles and is made up of three trails, starting at Milky Way, then to Eclipse, and Infinity. All three are easy trails; this goes around the backside of the mountain.
Experts only.
The trail names all have to do with space. This is due to that fact that Bristol Mountain first opened in the 1960s, during the space race, and is located a few miles from the CEK Mees Observatory.
Cross Country Skiing.
Bristol also has cross country skiing available at the Summit Nordic Center, consisting of two trails, one of which has snowmaking and lights for night skiing. The Summit Nordic Center is not directly accessible from Bristol Mountain's downhill base lodges; visitors must use the separate entrance by driving up the mountain to South Hill Road off of County Road 32.
Deaths.
On February 16, 2010, a Penfield man died in a snowboarding accident at Bristol Mountain. 48 year old Elliott A. Eklund was pronounced dead at Thompson Hospital in Canandaigua at 8:20 after striking a tree on Bristol Mountain's "Shooting Star" run at about 7:30. This is the first death that has occurred at the resort since 2001, when a 36-year-old Palmyra man died after skiing into a tree.
Coincidentally, on February 16, 1988, 17-year-old David Elliot of Penfield died after being injured in a skiing accident at Bristol Mountain.

Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory

The Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory (former name: Saint Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory) is a research laboratory situated on Hennepin Island in the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. Its primary research is in "Engineering, Environmental, Biological, and Geophysical Fluid Mechanics". It is affiliated with the University of Minnesota.
The laboratory is unique in that its location next to Saint Anthony Falls allows it to use the hydraulic head from the waterfall to provide water for many of the experiments.
The experiments performed at the laboratory are varied, and include:
The Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory is also the headquarters of the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics, a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center.
Research programs.
Research at SAFL includes the work of many fields, including civil engineering, hydraulic engineering, hydrology, ecology, and geology. Research at SAFL has been spurred on in the first decade of the 21st century by its status as the headquarters of the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics (NCED). Facilities at SAFL include the main channel, through which Mississippi River water can be sent for large-scale sediment transport experiments; the delta basins, designed to quickly build experimental stratigraphy; the eXperimental EarthScape facility (XES, nicknamed "Jurassic Tank"), a subsiding basin for large-scale depositional modeling; the Outdoor Stream Lab, which is used to understand fluvial processes and riparian ecology at closer to a field scale; and many other pieces of equipment. The lab is known for rapidly constructing and destructing experimental apparatuses, including full scale models of rivers to understand the effects of dam removal.
Analog material models of fluvial and depositional systems are employed by geologists at SAFL to understand the causes of river channel morphologies and dynamics, as well as to reconstruct the history of events that produces particular stratigraphic packages. Researchers working on channel morphology have shown the importance of vegetation in restricting braided channels to a single thread (and often sinuous) system. Research done on experimental alluvial fan deltas has highlighted the statistics of flow occupation and their potential hazard to life and property, shown autogenic cyclicity in patterns of sediment storage and release that determine short-term shoreline positions, and has been connected to sequence stratigraphy and the processes that form the stratigraphic record.

Tyler Sloan

Tyler Sloan (born March 15, 1981) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman in the Dallas Stars organization in the National Hockey League. An undrafted player, Sloan spent seven years in the minor leagues before making his NHL debut for the Washington Capitals in his home town of Calgary.
Playing career.
Sloan played junior hockey for the Calgary Royals of the Alberta Junior Hockey League and Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League. Though undrafted, he was signed by the Columbus Blue Jackets and assigned to the Syracuse Crunch of the American Hockey League at the end of the 2001–02 season. Sloan spent the next seven seasons bouncing around the minors, playing for the Dayton Bombers and Las Vegas Wranglers of the ECHL, as well as the AHL's Manitoba Moose and Hershey Bears. In 2006, Sloan and the Bears won the Calder Cup championship.
Sloan was recalled by the Washington Capitals early in the 2008–09 season, where he made his National Hockey League debut for the Capitals in his hometown of Calgary against the Flames on October 21, 2008. Sloan made an immediate impact for the Capitals, levelling Calgary's Daymond Langkow with a large bodycheck, and earning the Capitals a nine-minute powerplay in the aftermath. He scored his first NHL goal on October 25 against Marty Turco of the Dallas Stars.
Sloan was sent down to Hershey on January 11, 2009 as several injured Capitals returned to action. He was recalled on May 3, 2009 during the Capitals' playoff series with Pittsburgh along with Karl Alzner and recorded an assist in Game 2 of the series the following night.
On June 27, 2011, the Capitals placed him on waivers, with the possible intention of buying out his contract. A month later on July 28, Sloan was signed as a free agent by the Nashville Predators on a one-year deal.
On July 6, 2012, Sloan signed a one year, two-way contract with the Dallas Stars. The deal is worth $600,000 when Sloan plays for the Stars, and $105,000 when he plays for the Stars’ AHL affiliate, the Texas Stars.
Personal life.
Sloan's sister, Tara, was a five-time Canadian national swimming champion and Canadian record holder who was set to compete at the swimming trials for the 2000 Summer Olympics when she was killed in a roll-over accident near Medicine Hat, Alberta in March 2000. Tyler used the dedication his sister showed in attempting to win a spot on the Canadian Olympic team as inspiration in his own hockey career. His sister's journal of her attempts to qualify for the Olympics motivated Tyler: "Swimmers are tremendous athletes. Their work ethic is unparalleled. I saw what it took for her to get there. That was important because I didn't realize what it took to get to this level," he told the "Globe and Mail" newspaper.

PK Dwyer (born George Michael Jackson) who has also worked under the names Kevin Dwyer, Hollywood Dick Doll, and George Michael Jackson is a jump blues musician credited with forming the first-ever street band to busk at Pike Place Market, Seattle, Washington, USA. He formed that band, Felix & the Freelicks, shortly after he arrived in the Pacific Northwest in 1971. The band evolved into various other alignments, including (successively) the Dynamic Logs, the Jitters, Throbbing Gems, the Royal Famille du Caniveaux / Gutter People of Paris, all of whom played at the Market and in many other venues.
Born in Mill Valley, California, Dwyer has lived in a number of places, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Paris, the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina, and New York City. In 1970, Dwyer, then a street musician in Los Angeles wrote and recorded music for the film "Walk The Walk", directed by Jac Zacha. Soon after that he moved to Seattle and began performing on the streets and in the clubs with partner Donna Beck. He was a founding member and featured performer in a number of bands, including Felix & the Freelicks, the Dynamic Logs, self-described "cow punk" quintet The Jitters, Throbbing Gems, Royal Famille du Caniveaux / Gutter People of Paris, and the Hollywood Dick Doll Revue.
Dwyer won the First Annual Street Performers Competition in Paris in 1981. Shortly after that, in New York his controversial cabaret act The Hollywood Dick Doll Revue won praise from Suzanne Vega, Dave Van Ronk, and Richie Havens. Havens signed Dwyer to his production company in 1983.
In 1989, Seattle label PopLlama released Dwyer's album "George Michael Jackson: King Of Gonzo Folk".

Gertrude "Trudy" Warner was a voice actor in the Golden Age of Radio. Warner was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1917 and died in New York City in 1986.
By any account, Trudy Warner's career has to stand as one of the ten most ambitious, successful such careers in the history of radio ... some 28 years and well over 4,000 performances. She was considered one of the queens of daytime radio, appearing in dozens of daytime serials. She portrayed such well known characters as "the lovely Margot Lane" on "The Shadow" and Della Street on the daytime "Perry Mason". The "Lux Radio Theater" episode of "Mrs. Miniver" proved so popular, it was developed into a daytime serial with Warner in the title role and as narrator. She was the third busiest actor in the Golden Age of Radio.

Aimé Emmanuel Yoka

Aimé Emmanuel Yoka is a Congolese politician who has served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of State for Justice and Human Rights since 2007. Previously he was Director of the Cabinet of President Denis Sassou Nguesso from 2002 to 2007.
Political career.
Yoka was born at Oyo, located in the north of Congo-Brazzaville; he is the uncle of President Denis Sassou Nguesso and a lawyer by profession.
Under Sassou Nguesso, Yoka was first appointed to the government on 28 December 1980 as Minister-Delegate for Cooperation, working at the Presidency. Subsequently he was Director of the Cabinet of the President before being appointed as Minister of Mines, Energy, and Posts and Telecommunications in August 1988. He was elected to the Central Committee of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT) for the first time at the PCT's Fourth Ordinary Congress on 26–31 July 1989, and he was retained in his ministerial post in the government appointed on 13 August 1989. He left the government when the PCT's single-party rule collapsed in 1990–1991.
Shortly after the outbreak of the 1997 civil war on 5 June 1997, Yoka was included on the National Mediation Committee. When Sassou Nguesso returned to power in October 1997, ousting President Pascal Lissouba, he scrapped the elected local authorities that had been put in place under Lissouba and directly appointed new local authorities. Sassou Nguesso appointed Yoka as Mayor of Brazzaville, the capital; Yoka served in that post from 1997 to 1999, and he was Congo-Brazzaville's Ambassador to Morocco from 1999 to 2002. During that period, Yoka also chaired the commission responsible for drafting the 2002 constitution.
On 19 August 2002, Yoka was again appointed as Director of the Cabinet of President Sassou Nguesso, with the rank of Minister; accordingly, he succeeded Gérard Bitsindou in that capacity on 22 August 2002. As Director of the Presidential Cabinet, Yoka was described as "very active and very independent". He was subsequently appointed to the government as Minister of State for Justice and Human Rights on 3 March 2007, and he was succeeded as Director of the Cabinet by Firmin Ayessa on 22 May 2007.
Sassou Nguesso, acting on Yoka's recommendation as Minister of Justice, commuted all death sentences to life in prison with hard labor in August 2007.
After a French group, Zoe's Ark, made an abortive attempt to fly children out of Chad to Europe, causing a major scandal, Yoka announced on 31 October 2007 that the Congolese government was suspending international adoptions. Explaining this decision, he cited the Chadian incident as well as the adoptions of 17 Congolese children by Spanish families, which occurred shortly before the Chadian incident.
Yoka faced criticism from human rights advocates in late 2007 for inaction on a draft law on the protection of indigenous peoples, despite the government's apparent support for it.
Prior to the July 2009 presidential election, Yoka was President of the Preparatory Committee for the National Initiative for Peace (INP), a political association promoting Sassou Nguesso's re-election while stressing the importance of peace. At the association's debut rally in Brazzaville on 28 February 2009, Yoka introduced it to the public, explaining the purpose and approach of the INP.
In the July–August 2012 parliamentary election, Yoka was elected to the National Assembly as the PCT candidate in Vindza constituency, located in the Pool Department. He won the seat in the second round of voting, receiving 56.05% of the vote.

Fake Empire

"Fake Empire" is a song by Brooklyn-based indie rock band The National from their fourth studio album, "Boxer". The song was released in June 2008 as the album's third and final single.
Production.
"Fake Empire" was written by Bryce Dessner of The National. Commenting on the song's initial concept, he said, "Conceptually I said I would love to write a song that was based on a certain polyrhythm, the four-over-three pattern, which is what you hear in the piano. It's something I, personally, have never heard in rock music. What's interesting is the song sounds like it's in four, but it's in three. The harmonies and the way I'm playing the piano music are actually incredibly simple – sort of like "Chopsticks" simple – with this really weird rhythm. At the end we said, 'Oh, wouldn't it be cool if we had a horn fanfare?' so Padma wrote this very Steve Reichian minimalist horn fanfare."
Promotion.
The National made their network television debut when they performed "Fake Empire" on the "Late Show with David Letterman" on July 24, 2007. In the television series "Chuck", the song appeared in the episode "Chuck Versus the Break-up" on October 13, 2008. "Fake Empire" also played during the final scene of the pilot episode of NBC's police drama "Southland", as well as over the concluding scene and credits of the 2008 film "Battle in Seattle". An instrumental version of the song was featured in Barack Obama's campaign video "Signs of Hope and Change" during his 2008 United States presidential campaign, and the song was also played at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. The members of The National supported the presidential candidate; they put Obama's face on a fundraising t-shirt with the text "Mr. November", taken from the name of a song from the band's third album, "Alligator". In the fifth season premiere episode of the teen drama television series "One Tree Hill", several songs by The National were featured, including "Fake Empire".
Reception.
Allmusic considered "Fake Empire" one of The National's best songs, and described it as a song that "begins as a dead-of-night ballad that echoes Leonard Cohen, then peppy brass and guitars turn it into something joyous." Mark Mordue of "WAToday" called "Fake Empire" "one of the great rock'n'roll songs" of 2007. He described it as "a romantic-sounding tune marked by a quiet declaration that 'We're half awake in a fake empire,' married the lonely-guy blues of a New York night to a veiled critique of American imperialism. In short, it expressed the feelings of being lost inside a dream." "Stylus Magazine" ranked "Fake Empire" as the 7th-best song of 2007.
Cover versions.
Danny Seim of Menomena recorded a cover of the song in 2008 for his solo project, Lackthereof, on the album "Your Anchor".
Ryan Lewis also released a song called "Fake Empire" on the album "]" in 2010 together with Macklemore. It samples the "Fake Empire" refrain, therefore making it a remix rather than a cover.
Anna-Lynne Williams released a version of the song as Lotte Kestner on her 2011 album "Stolen".

George Wythe McCook

George Wythe McCook (November 21, 1821 – December 28, 1877) was a lawyer, politician, and soldier from the state of Ohio in the United States. He was the Ohio Attorney General and an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was a member of the famed Fighting McCooks, a prominent military family that contributed more than a dozen officers to the war effort.
Early life and career.
McCook was born in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, the son of a local attorney, Daniel McCook and Martha Latimer McCook. He was one of an evantual twelve children (nine boys and three girls). In 1826 the family moved to New Lisbon, Ohio, and then to Carrollton. He graduated from Ohio University and subsequently studied law with Edwin M. Stanton, and afterward became his partner. He served as an officer in the 3rd Ohio Infantry Regiment throughout the Mexican War, and returned from the war as its commander.
He was the Attorney General of Ohio from 1854–1856 and edited the first volume of the "Ohio State Reports." During his term in office, McCook specialized in railroad law. His skill in this area was noticed by the Steubenville and Indiana Railroad Company, and after his term ended, the company sent him to Europe on legal business.
McCook was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina.
Civil War service.
At the war's outset, McCook was one of the first four brigadier generals selected by the Governor of Ohio to command the troops from that state, but, because of impaired health from his Mexican service, McCook was prevented from accepting that post. Later, he was appointed as the lieutenant colonel of the 2nd Ohio Infantry, and spent much of the war recruiting volunteers for several new regiments. He was named by Governor William Dennison as the Ohio Adjutant General.
Later, he accepted an appointment as the colonel of the 157th Ohio Infantry, Hundred Days Regiment. He was second-in-command of the prisoner-of-war camp at Fort Delaware.
At the end of the war, he received the brevet rank of brigadier general, dating from March 13, 1865.
Postbellum career.
After the war, McCook resumed his legal practice and political career. In 1871 he was the Democratic candidate for governor of Ohio. However, he lost to another former Union Army officer, Col. Edward F. Noyes, by more than twenty thousand votes.
He, with the Rev. Dr. Charles Beatty, were the largest contributors to the erection of the Second Presbyterian Church at Steubenville, Ohio, of which he was a trustee.
McCook died in Steubenville and is buried in Union Cemetery.

Dettingen Te Deum

The Dettingen Te Deum (HWV 283) is a canticle in D major composed by George Frideric Handel in 1743.
Background.
On 27 June 1743, the British army and its allies, under the command of King George II and Lord Stair, won a victory at the Battle of Dettingen, over the French army, commanded by the Maréchal de Noailles and the Duc de Grammont. On the King's return a day of public thanksgiving was appointed, and Handel, at that time "Composer of the Musick to the Chapel Royal," was commissioned to write a Te Deum and an anthem ("The King Shall Rejoice") for the occasion. The work was composed between 17 and 29 July 1743 and was first performed on 27 November 1743 in the Chapel Royal of St. James's Palace, London in the presence of George II.
Musical analysis.
The Dettingen Te Deum is not a Te Deum in the strict sense, but a grand martial panegyric. It contains eighteen short solos and choruses, mostly of a brilliant, martial character, the solos being divided between the alto, baritone, and bass. After a brief instrumental prelude, the work opens with the triumphant, jubilant chorus with trumpets and drums ("We praise Thee, O God"), written for the five parts, the sopranos being divided into first and seconds, containing also a short alto solo leading to a closing fugue. 
The second number ("All the earth doth worship Thee") is also an alto solo with five-part chorus of the same general character. It is followed by a semi-chorus in three parts ("To Thee all Angels cry aloud"), plaintive in style, and leading to the full chorus ("To Thee, Cherubin and Seraphim"), which is majestic in its movement and rich in harmony. The fifth number is a quartet and chorus ("The glorious Company of the Apostles praise Thee"), dominated by the bass, with responses from the other parts, and followed by a short, full chorus ("Thine honourable, true, and only Son"). The seventh number is a stirring bass solo with trumpets. A fanfare of trumpets introduces the next four numbers, all choruses. In this group the art of fugue and counterpoint is splendidly illustrated, but never to the sacrifice of brilliant effect, which is also heightened by the trumpets in the accompaniments. An impressive bass solo ("Vouchsafe, O Lord") intervenes, and then the trumpets sound the stately symphony to the final chorus ("O Lord, in Thee have I trusted"). It begins with a long alto solo with delicate oboe accompaniment that makes the effect very impressive when voices and instruments take up the phrase in a magnificent outburst of power and rich harmony, and carry it to the close.

American Student Assistance

History.
American Student Assistance was founded in 1956 under the name Massachusetts Higher Education Assistance Corporation (MHEAC). The organization began when a group of people approached Massachusetts local businesses for philanthropic donations with the idea of creating a pool of money to guarantee loans for higher education. MHEAC went on to become the nation’s first student loan guarantor. Its model of a student loan program—funded by local banks and insured by a non-profit organization—was replicated across the country and by 1965, there were 14 loan guarantors in the United States.
In 1990, the United States Department of Education designated MHEAC as the guarantor for Washington, D.C. By 1992, MHEAC had begun to expand its services nationwide, so the organization adopted a trade name of American Student Assistance to reflect that its services were available to U.S. student loan borrowers everywhere.
Voluntary Flexible Agreement.
In 2001, ASA became one of four guarantors to enter into a Voluntary Flexible Agreement (VFA) with the US federal government, changing its focus from back-end default collections to an emphasis on delinquency and default prevention. The Voluntary Flexible Agreement enabled Federal Family Education Loan Program guarantors to develop programs and techniques to help borrowers avoid student-loan default and all of its negative consequences. ASA’s Wellness program was designed to deliver debt management information to borrowers at critical points along the life of their loan in order to prevent repayment problems before they start.
Results of these Wellness activities proved that the proactive approach to giving student loan borrowers the right information at exactly the right time were effective in preventing repayment problems. According to ASA studies, graduates who received financial literacy and career information from ASA during the first two years of repayment were half as likely to default as those who did not; since 2002, ASA has beaten national Cohort Default Rates (borrowers newly entering repayment) by more than 46 percent, with 95 percent of the loans in its portfolio in good standing, on average; and ASA saved taxpayers approximately $120 million through prevented student loan defaults between fiscal years 2001 and 2008.
All student loan guarantor VFAs were canceled by the U.S. Department of Education in 2008.
Looking forward.
In 2010, federal legislation ended privately financed, federally guaranteed education loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program, in favor of Direct Loans originated directly by the federal government. Therefore, ASA has guaranteed no new education loans since July 1, 2010. The organization continues to fulfill its obligations as a student loan guarantor to the U.S. Department of Education for its remaining FFELP portfolio, which stands at approximately $35 billion and 1.3 million borrowers.
Additionally, in 2012 ASA launched “SALT™,” a financial education membership program that teaches students how to borrow less and more wisely for higher education; how to repay student loans successfully; and how to build better overall financial skills in life. ASA’s goal with SALT is to revolutionize the way students finance and repay higher education, transforming them from passive financial aid recipients to instead proactive, financially savvy consumers who truly own their student loans and finances.
ASA is often cited as an expert reference on student loans by national and local media.
Both the Boston Globe and the Boston Business Journal have named the organization as one of the best places to work in Boston since 2008. The company currently has approximately 500 employees.

Sentinel loop

A sentinel loop is a sign seen on an X-ray that indicates localized ileus from nearby inflammation. Simply put, it is the dilatation of a segment of large or small intestine.
An isolated distended loop of bowel is seen near the site of injured viscus or inflamed organ. This loop is called a "sentinel loop." It arises from the body's efforts to localize traumatic or inflammatory lesions. The local distention of that intestinal loop is due to local paralysis and accumulation of gas in the intestinal loop.
In acute pancreatitis, the sentinel loop is usually seen in left hypochondrium, while in acute cholecystitis, it is seen in the right hypochondrium. In acute appendicitis, the sentinel loop is seen in right iliac fossa.

Cyclone Funa

Severe Tropical Cyclone Funa (RSMC Nadi designation: 10F, JTWC designation: 12P) was the strongest tropical cyclone during the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season, causing heavy flood and wind damage to areas of Vanuatu. The third tropical cyclone and second severe tropical cyclone of the to form to the west of 160°E, Funa formed from an area of disturbed weather within the monsoon trough northeast of Vanuatu on January 16, 2008. Steadily intensifying as it moved to the east and subsequently south, Funa reached peak intensity with winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), sustained for ten minutes. However, the cyclone encountered unfavorable conditions as it progressed further south, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on 
January 21.
Cyclone Funa severely affected areas of Vanuatu, especially to the island chain's infrastructure. Regions of the coast were also inundated by sea flooding caused by strong storm surge associated with Funa. Offshore, the cruise ship "Pacific Star" sustained heavy damage from the cyclone's strong waves. The cyclone's remnants later caused strong winds in New Zealand, resulting in power outages and fires.
Meteorological history.
On February 15 the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), reported that a tropical depression had developed within an monsoon trough, about 700 km (435 mi) to the northeast of Port Vila on the Vanuatuan island of Efate. During that day the depression moved eastwards and gradually developed further, before as vertical windshear slackened a little, the JTWC and RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had developed into a tropical cyclone with the later naming it as Funa at 0600 UTC on February 16.
The cyclone then started to move eastwards and passed near the northern tip of Aurora Island, Vanuatu with wind speeds of , making Funa a category two cyclone on the Australian scale. After leaving Vanuatu, Funa intensified slowly becoming a Category 3 severe Tropical cyclone on January 18 and then early the next day it reached its peak wind speeds of which the same as a category 4 cyclone according the Southern Pacific Cyclone Scale. The JTWC measured Funa's peak winds at . The storm then moved into TCWC Wellington area of responsibility it started to weaken and then became extra tropical the next day with the JTWC issuing their final advisory on January 20, with TCWC Wellington downgrading it to a low later that day.
Preparations and impact.
Severe damage occurred over the groups of islands in the Torba, Sanma, and Penama provinces of Vanuatu, particularly on dwellings (made of local material), trees, and crops. Over the Banks Islands, coastal villages were reported to have been inundated by sea flooding, including in Maewo. On Motalava and Rah Island, as well as Gaua in Santa Maria Island, bungalows, resorts, and restaurants along the coast were either washed away or inundated by sea flooding, according to their provincial council reports. Most schools in the Torba and Penama provinces sustained major damages to classrooms and other semi-permanent structures, while other buildings had their roofs ripped off. There were no reports of any fatalities but minor casualties were confirmed.
On January 19, a cruise ship, the Pacific Star, encountered 7 metre (22.9 ft) waves produced by Funa. Numerous windows were broken on the ship as it was tossed around by the waves. Water poured into passengers rooms through broken windows, causing panic throughout the ship. Five people were injured, one of whom sustained a broken rib after falling out of bed when a wave hit the ship. The bar area of the ship was reportedly significantly damaged and dishes and glasses were shattered in the kitchen.
The remnants of Funa produced high winds in the North Island of New Zealand which knocked down numerous trees, cutting power to 16,000 residents on the island. Downed power lines sparked several fires. Waves up to 5 m (16.4 ft) impacted coastal regions of New Zealand, forcing boaters to remain in port. Upwards of 300 mm (11.8 in) of rain fell across parts of New Zealand and gale-force winds fanned brushfires.
After the season had ended, it was announced that Cyclone Funa had been retired from RSMC Nadi's list of tropical cyclone names, and would be replaced by Fotu.

Carrot 4NT

The Carrot 4NT slam-convention was developed in Carrot Club, but can be used in any bidding system instead of the more common Blackwood or RKC conventions. It is a refinement of an older convention, Culbertson 4NT.
Rather than asking for Aces or keycards, 4NT is used to "show" number of keycards.
This convention applies when 4NT is preceded by cuebids, and generally when 4NT is a non-jumping bid.
The immediate advantage of this approach over Blackwood/RKC, is that while still establishing the combined number of keycards, 
the pair will be able to utilize the 5-level for cuebids, too, to more thoroughly explore and negotiate their slam-potential.
Normally, 4NT shows at least 3 out of 5 keycards (including the King of trumps) plus first or second round control in any suit(s) not yet cuebid.
Thus, if a player by-passes 4NT or omits bidding 4NT when he logically could,
it means that he "either" lacks the required number of keycards "or"
that he lacks control in a side-suit that has not yet been cuebid.
If a player has already shown a 17+hcp hand (by reverse-bid, big-club opening, takeout-double followed by new suit, etc.), 
his partner's 4NT promises only 2 out of 5 keycards.
If a player has opened with a strong 2C or shown a 20+ balanced hand,
and later bids 4NT, he promises 4 out of 5 keycards.
Under this convention, 4NT is still Blackwood or RKC when it is a "jumping" bid and not a natural raise.
Also, if a player opens, raises, or jumps to 4H/4S without any preceding cuebids, 4NT by his partner is Blackwood or RKC.
Likewise, in competitive situations where opponents have bid at the 3- or 4-level, 4NT is Blackwood or RKC.

Waltham Forest Festival of Theatre

Waltham Forest Festival of Theatre has taken place each year in the London Borough of Waltham Forest, in East London, UK. Waltham Forest Festival of Theatre is an amateur drama festival of one act plays. Waltham Forest Festival of Theatre is the only amateur theatre festival in East London. 
The patron of the Waltham Forest Festival of Theatre is actor Sir Derek Jacobi CBE.
Festival Rules state that plays must be more than 20 minutes and no more than 55 minutes long to be performed at the Festival and there must be more than one speaking part in any play. 
Waltham Forest Festival of Theatre serves as a first round festival in the Eastern District of the All England Theatre Festival (the AETF), and is affiliated to the National Drama Festivals Association (NDFA). Thus the winners of the Waltham Forest Festival of Theatre may be invited to perform at the NDFA British All Winners Festival that takes place each year in July. 
Each year the Waltham Forest Festival of Theatre has entries from adult amateur drama groups, amateur theatre companies, youth theatre clubs and school and college drama clubs and classes. The Festival is organised into both adult and youth sections and each competing team presents a one act play. Two or three one-act plays are performed at each evening or matinee session of the Festival. The Festival takes place across a week, so often there are between 15 and 18 different theatre companies performing a play on stage during the week of the Festival. 
A professional adjudicator from the Guild of Drama Adjudicators (GODA)GODA webpage sits in the audience and judges each play on its merits. The Adjudicator takes to the stage at the end of the session and comments on each play, the acting, its staging, costumes, lighting and set. The Adjudicator's marks are added up on the final night to decide who has won the Festival. The winning team is then eligible to enter succeeding rounds of the knockout competition, which culminates in the All-England Final in June and the British Final in July. 
There are also awards for best actor, best actress, best performer under 18 years of age, best new writing, best comedy.
History.
The Waltham Forest Festival of Theatre began in 1981 as the Waltham Forest Drama Festival. The name Waltham Forest Festival of Theatre was adopted in 2006. 
The original venue that the Festival was normally held in - the Waltham Forest Theatre in Lloyd Park, Walthamstow - was demolished in 2011, and the Festival's current regular venue is Chingford Assembly Hall [http://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/Pages/ServiceChild/Chingford-Assembly-Hall.aspx].

The Xiangyang–Chongqing Railway or Xiangyu Railway (襄渝铁路), also known as the Xiangfan-Chongqing Railway and Xiangyu Line (襄渝线), is a single-track electrified railroad in central China between the cities of Xiangyang, formerly known as Xiangfan, and Chongqing. The short form name for Chongqing is Yu (渝) and the railway is named after the two cities. It has a total length of 895.3 km and passes through Hubei, Shaanxi and Sichuan province, and Chongqing municipality. Major cities along route include Shiyan, Ankang, Dazhou and Guang'an.
The Xiangyu Railway is a major transportation route that connects the Sichuan Basin with the Central Plains. It was built from 1964 to 1979, and electrified in three phases from 1980 to 1998. Trains running on the Xiangyu Line can reach top speeds of 100–120 km/h. Construction of a second track began in 2005 and was completed in 2009.
Second Xiangyu Line.
The Second Xiangfan-Chongqing Railway (襄渝二线) is a dual-track electrified railroad line that runs parallel to the Xiangyu Line. This line is only 507 km in length and connects the same cities as the original Xiangyu line. It takes a more direct route through the mountainous terrain with bridges and tunnels, and accommodates faster trains (up to 160 km/h) and a greater carrying capacity. Construction began on August 13, 2005. and was scheduled to be completed by July 2008, but work was slowed by difficulties in bridge and tunnel work which pushed the project 30% over budget. The New Iron Mountain Tunnel (新铁山隧道), 3,347 m length, was completed on April 20, 2007 after 20 months of difficult work, overcoming interior rockslides and carbon monoxide build-up inside the tunnel.
The Second Xiangyu Line opened on October 31, 2009.
Painting of the Xiangyu Line.
The Xiangyu Line is the subject of an enormous landscape scroll painting that is 1.6 m wide and 128 m long. It was completed by Yang Migui in May 2008 who was a worker on the line's construction in the 1970s, and began working on the painting in 1998. It is reportedly the world's longest painting created by a single artist.

Johann Christian Gottlob Baumgarten

Johann Christian Gottlob Baumgarten (1765–1843) was a German physician and botanist who was a native of Luckau in Lower Lusatia.
He studied in Dresden and Leipzig, and while at Leipzig performed field studies of its local flora, publishing the treatise "Flora Lipsiensis" in 1790. That same year he earned his philosophy degree, and in 1791 received his medical doctorate. Afterwards he furthered his studies of botany and medicine in Vienna. 
In 1793 he travelled to Transylvania, where he undertook pioneer investigations of its flora. Subsequently he remained in Transylvania for the rest of life, working as a doctor and teacher in Schäßburg (today- Sighişoara, Romania). In 1816 he published the first of a four-volume work on Transylvanian flora titled "Enumeratio Stirpium in Magno Transylvaniae Principatu praeprimis indigenarum".
A species of bellflower, "Campanula baumgartenii", is named after Baumgarten.

Defenceman and former captain Peg Duval left the team to sign with the Pittsburgh Victorias as a professional in the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League.
Regular season.
Highlights.
This season was the first season for Frank McGee and Art Moore. McGee would place second in the league scoring race with 14 goals in six games.
The season would be a two team race between Montreal Victorias and Ottawa, splitting their matches between each other. The season ended in a tie, which necessitated a two-game playoff, won by Ottawa to win their first Stanley Cup.
Playoffs.
Ottawa and Victorias played a two-game total-goals series.
Stanley Cup challenges.
Rat Portage vs. Ottawa.
Ottawa defeated the Rat Portage Thistles 6–2, 4–2 (10–4) in a two-game, total goals series in Ottawa, March 12–14, 1903.
As the new CAHL and Cup champions, the Ottawas accepted a challenge from the Rat Portage Thistles of the Manitoba & Northwestern Hockey Association (MNWHA). Entering the best-of-three challenge series, the Thistles were younger and quicker than Ottawa; only one player on the Thistles was over the age of 20. However, poor soft ice conditions in Ottawa played a major factor as Ottawa swept the series with scores of 6–2 and 4–2.
For their win, the Ottawa players would each receive a silver nugget. From that point on the team would also be known as the "Silver Seven."

Lind Coulee Archaeological Site

The Lind Coulee Archaeological Site, also known as 45GR97, is the site of an archaeological dig near Warden, Washington. The site was the first evidence of human habitation of Washington older than about 2,000–4,000 years. The site was discovered in 1947, by the River Basin Surveys program of the Smithsonian Institution. Richard D. Daugherty (then a graduate student at the University of Washington) was informed of the existence of bones and stone tools about underground, and he began visiting the site in 1948. From 1950 to 1951, Daugherty was director of excavation at the site. During this excavation, Daugherty made the first definite link (dating to between 7450 B.C.E. and 6568 BCE) between human tools in the Columbia Basin and extinct bison remains. These digs also found stone palettes used for grinding red ochre, the first time that items such as this had been found in Washington. 
While the dates originally given to items at the site were acquired through radiocarbon dating, a bone from the site was tested with accelerator mass spectrometry in 2003, and gave a new date of between 10,550 and 11,290 years old.
In 1968, excavation was resumed, at times by Roald H. Fryxell. The site had been dry when first discovered, but it was feared that the site would be damaged by runoff from agricultural irrigation. This dig lasted until 1972. Work was primarily directed towards recording the sedimentary stratigraphy at the site in relation to the cultural deposits. Based on this new information 
it is believed that the site was occupied by humans more than half a dozen times, over a period of 10–150 years, but that it was mainly a spring camp, due to the preponderance of remains of young bison and unborn elk.
Artifacts recovered included a large number of bone tools, including nearly two dozen bone needles, and bone points. The distinctive chipped stone points found belong to the western Stemmed Point Tradition. Also, a wide variety of cutting and scraping stone tools were found that illustrate sophisticated proficiency in working stone.

Adventive species

Adventive species is a term relating to certain introduced species. The term is now used in a more restricted sense than its initial usage.
The earliest and most widespread concept among biologists is: An adventive species is one that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region (without further caveats). This is a the forerunner of the term 'non-indigenous species' although it lacks the frequently invoked basis of the word 'introduced', which means different things to different writers. In this sense, cattle egret ("Bubulcus ibis") which arrived in North America by natural range expansion, black rat ("Rattus rattus"), which is believed to have arrived as a hitchhiker aboard ships, and kudzu vine ("Pueraria lobata"), which was introduced deliberately by humans, are all adventive species and have established populations. Common adventive species include herbivorous insects.
The later and more limited concept is that: An adventive species is one that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region; however, its population is not self-sustaining. Population numbers are only increased through re-introduction. After some time, an adventive species may become naturalized OR some populations do not sustain themselves reproductively, but exist because of continued influx from elsewhere. Such a non-sustaining population, or the individuals within it, are said to be adventive. Cultivated plants are a major source of adventive populations. It is estimated that 10-20% of adventive species used in biological control programs eventually become naturalized.

History of Winnipeg

The history of Winnipeg comprises its initial population by Aboriginal peoples through its settlement by Europeans to the present day. The first forts were built on the site in the 1700s, followed by the Selkirk settlement in 1812. Winnipeg was incorporated as a city in 1873 and experienced a population boom after the completion of the railway through the city. After the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 the city entered a period of decline that ended with the advent of the Second World War. The current City of Winnipeg was created by Unicity in 1971.
Before incorporation.
Winnipeg lies at the confluence of the Assiniboine River and the Red River, known as The Forks, a historic focal point on canoe river routes travelled by Aboriginal peoples for thousands of years. The name "Winnipeg" is named after Lake Winnipeg to the north, and the name is related to a native word referring to the cloudy, silt filled water flowing off the prairies. The general area was populated for thousands of years by First Nations. In prehistory, through oral stories, archaeology, petroglyphs, rock art, and ancient artifacts, it is known that natives would use the area for camps, hunting, fishing, trading, and further north, agriculture. The first farming in Manitoba appeared to be along the Red River, near Lockport, Manitoba, where maize (corn) and other seed crops were planted before contact with Europeans. For thousands of years there have been humans living in this region, and there are many archaeological clues about their ways of life. The rivers provided transportation far and wide and linked many peoples-such as the Assiniboine, Ojibway, Anishinaabe, Mandan, Sioux, Cree, Lakota, and others—for trade and knowledge sharing. Ancient mounds were once made near the waterways, similar to that of the mound builders of the south. Lake Winnipeg was considered to be an inland sea, with important river links to the mountains out west, the Great Lakes to the east, and the Arctic Ocean in the north. The Red River linked ancient northern and southern peoples along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. The first maps of some areas were made on birch bark by the Ojibway, which helped fur traders find their way along the rivers and lakes.
Settlement.
The first aboriginal fur traders in the area would have been trading with the Hudson's Bay Company forts to the north, or with the North West Company forts to the south and east. The Hudson's Bay Company and British colonialists laid claim to the entire area of Rupert's Land in the late 1600s. This entire Hudson Bay drainage basin included the area now known as Winnipeg. Fur traders working with and trading with the Hudson's Bay Company would have traveled and lived along the major rivers, including the Red River.
The first French officer arrived in the area in 1738. Sieur de La Vérendrye built the first fur trading post on the site (Fort Rouge), which was later abandoned. The French traded in the area for several decades before Hudson Bay traders arrived. The first English traders visited the area about the year 1767. Fort Gibraltar was built by the North West Company in 1809. 
In 1811, the Scottish aristocrat and humanitarian Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk, received from the Hudson's Bay Company a grant of 116,000 square miles in the basins of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, which he named Assiniboia. His goal was to establish the first permanent agricultural settlement along the Red River near the junction of the two rivers, to be inhabited by displaced Scottish Highland families and retired Rupert's Land employees of the Hudson's Bay Company. The Red River Settlement was founded in 1812 and the construction of Fort Douglas was overseen by Miles Macdonell, Lord Selkirk's Governor of Assiniboia, in 1813 - 14. As the settlers arrived over the next few years to commence the first European agriculture on the northern great plains, the two companies fought fiercely over trade in the area, and each destroyed some of the other's forts over the course of several battles. Lord Selkirk died prematurely of tuberculosis in 1820 and in 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies ended their long rivalry with a merger.
The Hudson's Bay Company then relocated its operations from Fort Douglas to Fort Gibraltar, located on the present day site of The Forks National Historic Site in Winnipeg. Fort Gibralter was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson’s Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 flood, and it was not rebuilt until 1835 as Upper Fort Garry. The fort was the residence of the Governor of the company for many years. It became a part of the first major colony and settlement in western Canada.
Beginning in the mid-17th century the Métis, an ethnic group descended from the mixing of French traders and Cree tribes people as well as other First Nations peoples, began settling in the Red River Valley. They were heavily involved in the fur trade as hunters and traders. Important British trading posts included Fort Alexander, operated by the Hudson's Bay Company, and Fort Bas-de-la-Rivière, operated by the North West Company. Additionally as settlers from the U.S. established posts in what is now Minnesota, illegal trade routes known as the Red River Trails developed between the Red River Colony and Saint Paul.
In 1869–70, Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and the newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to put down the rebellion. This rebellion led directly to Manitoba's entry into the Confederation as Canada's fifth province in 1870, and on November 8, 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city. In 1876, three years after the city's incorporation, the post office officially adopted the name "Winnipeg."
Railway boomtown.
The first locomotive in Winnipeg, the "Countess of Dufferin", arrived via steamboat in 1877. The Canadian Pacific Railway completed the first direct rail link from eastern Canada in 1881, opening the door to mass immigration and settlement of Winnipeg and the Canadian Prairies. The history of Winnipeg's rail heritage and the "Countess of Dufferin" may be seen at the Winnipeg Railway Museum.
Winnipeg experienced a boom during the 1890s and the first two decades of the 20th century, and the city's population grew from 25,000 in 1891 to more than 179,000 in 1921. The only large city on the prairie in 1891, Winnipeg was until the second decade of the twentieth century the leading commercial center of the prairie provinces. In succeeding decades as other prairie centers such as Calgary, Edmonton, and Regina become centers of trade, Winnipeg's relative role was reduced, although it remained preeminent. As immigration increased during this period, Winnipeg took on its distinctive multicultural character. The Manitoba Legislative Building reflects the optimism of the boom years. Built mainly of Tyndall Stone and opened in 1920, its dome supports a bronze statue finished in gold leaf titled, "Eternal Youth and the Spirit of Enterprise" (commonly known as the "Golden Boy"). The Manitoba Legislature was built in the neoclassical style that is common to many other North American state and provincial legislative buildings of the 19th century and early 20th century. The Legislature was built to accommodate representatives for three million people, which was the expected population of Manitoba at the time.
Winnipeg faced financial difficulty when the Panama Canal opened in 1914. The canal reduced reliance on Canada's rail system for international trade, and the increase in ship traffic helped Vancouver surpass Winnipeg to become Canada's third-largest city in the 1960s.
Winnipeg General Strike.
Following World War I, owing to a postwar recession, appalling labour conditions, and the presence of radical union organizers and a large influx of returning soldiers, 35,000 Winnipeggers walked off the job in May 1919 in what came to be known as the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on June 21, 1919, when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured, resulting in the day's being known as "Bloody Saturday"; the lasting effect was a polarized population. One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), which would later become the New Democratic Party.
The Great Depression and World War II.
The stock market crash of 1929 only hastened an already steep decline in Winnipeg; the Great Depression resulted in massive unemployment, which was worsened by drought and depressed agricultural prices. The Depression ended when World War II started in 1939. The first Canadian to see battle was Winnipegger Selby Roger Henderson who enlisted in the RAF just before the start of the war. He participated in the attack on enemy ships at Wilhelmshaven, Germany on September 4, 1939.
The Winnipeg Grenadiers were among the first Canadians to engage in combat against Japan in the Battle of Hong Kong during World War II. Those in the battalion that didn't die in the conflict were captured and brutalized in prisoner of war camps.
In Winnipeg, the established armouries of Minto, Tuxedo (Fort Osborne), and McGregor were so crowded that the military had to take over other buildings to increase capacity. In 1942, the Government of Canada's Victory Loan Campaign staged a mock Nazi invasion of Winnipeg to increase awareness of the stakes of the war in Europe. The very realistic invasion included Nazi aircraft and troops overwhelming Canadian forces within the city. Air raid sirens sounded and the city was blacked out. The event was covered by North American media and featured in the film "If Day".
Winnipeg played a large part in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP). The mandate of the BCATP was to train flight crews away from the battle zones in Europe. Pilots, navigators, bombardiers, wireless operators, air gunners, and flight engineers all passed through Winnipeg on their way to the various air schools across western Canada; Winnipeg served as a headquarters for Command No. 2.
After World War II and the 1950 flood.
The end of World War II brought a new sense of optimism in Winnipeg. Pent-up demand brought a boom in housing development, but building activity came to a halt due to the 1950 Red River Flood, the largest flood to hit Winnipeg since 1861; the flood held waters above flood stage for 51 days. On May 8, 1950, eight dikes collapsed, four of the city's eleven bridges were destroyed, and nearly 100,000 people had to be evacuated, making it Canada's largest evacuation in history. Premier Douglas Campbell called for federal assistance, and Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent declared a state of emergency. Soldiers from the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry regiment staffed the relief effort for the duration of the flood. The federal government estimated damages at over $26-million, although the province insisted it was at least double that.
To protect the city from future flood damage, the Red River Basin Investigation recommended a system of flood control measures, including multiple diking systems and a floodway to divert the Red River around Winnipeg; this prompted construction of the Red River Floodway under Premier Dufferin Roblin.
Recent history.
Prior to 1972, Winnipeg was the largest of thirteen cities and towns in a metropolitan area around the Red and Assiniboine rivers. Unicity was created on July 27, 1971, and took effect with the first elections in 1972. The City of Winnipeg Act incorporated the current city of Winnipeg; the municipalities of Transcona, St. Boniface, St. Vital, West Kildonan, East Kildonan, Tuxedo, Old Kildonan, North Kildonan, Fort Garry, Charleswood, and the City of St. James, were amalgamated with the Old City of Winnipeg.
In 1979, the Eaton's catalogue building was converted into the first downtown mall in the city. It was called Eaton Place, but would change its name to Cityplace following the controversial demolition of the empty Eaton's store in 2002.
Immediately following the 1979 energy crisis, Winnipeg experienced a severe economic downturn in advance of the early 1980s recession. Throughout the recession, the city incurred closures of prominent businesses such as the Winnipeg Tribune and the Swift's and Canada Packers meat packing plants. In 1981, Winnipeg was one of the first cities in Canada to sign a tripartite agreement to redevelop its downtown area. The three levels of government—federal, provincial and municipal—have contributed over $271-million to the development needs of downtown Winnipeg over the past 20 years. The funding was instrumental in attracting Portage Place mall, which comprises the headquarters of Investors Group, the offices of Air Canada, and several apartment complexes.
In 1989, the reclamation and redevelopment of the CNR rail yards at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine rivers turned The Forks into Winnipeg's most popular tourist attraction.
In 1993, feeling that their community needs were not being fulfilled, the residents of Headingley seceded from Winnipeg and officially became incorporated as a municipality.
In 1996 Winnipeg's National Hockey League team (the Winnipeg Jets) left for Phoenix, Arizona. Fifteen years later, the Atlanta Thrashers of the NHL relocated to Winnipeg for the 2011-12 season.
During the 1997 Red River Flood, the floodway was pushed to its limits. The Red River Floodway Expansion is set to be completed in late 2010 at a final cost of more than $665,000,000 CAD.
Political history.
The first elections for city government in Winnipeg were held shortly after incorporation in 1873. On January 5, 1874, Francis Evans Cornish, former mayor of London, Ontario, defeated "Winnipeg Free Press" editor and owner William F. Luxton by a margin of 383 votes to 179. There were only 382 eligible voters in the city at the time, but property owners were allowed to vote in every civic poll in which they owned property. Until 1955, mayors could only serve one term. City government consisted of 13 aldermen and one mayor; this number of elected officials remained constant until 1920.
Construction of a new City Hall commenced in 1875. The building proved to be a structural nightmare, and eventually had to be held up by props and beams. The building was eventually demolished so that a new City Hall could be built in 1883.
A new City Hall building was constructed in 1886. It was a "gingerbread" building, built in Victorian grandeur, and symbolized Winnipeg's coming of age at the end of the 19th century. The building stood for nearly 80 years. There was a plan to replace it around the World War I era (during the construction of the Manitoba Legislative Building), but the war delayed that process. In 1958, falling plaster almost hit visitors to the City Hall building. The tower eventually had to be removed, and in 1962, the whole building was torn down.
The Winnipeg City Council embraced the idea of a "Civic Centre" as a replacement for the old city hall. The concept originally called for an administrative building and a council building, with a courtyard in between. Eventually, a police headquarters and remand centre (the Public Safety Building) and parkade were added to the plans. The four buildings were completed in 1964 in the brutalist style, at a cost of $8.2 million. The Civic Centre and the Manitoba Centennial Centre were connected by underground tunnels in 1967.

Vanier Park

Vanier Park is a municipal park located in the Kitsilano neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is home to the Vancouver Museum, the Vancouver Maritime Museum, the City of Vancouver Archives, and the H.R. MacMillan Space Centre.
History.
The Squamish people and their kin, the Tsleil-Waututh. Musqueam and Squamish/Tsleil-Waututh established a brief political unity in the late 19th Century and early 20th Century by Chief August Jack, aka Qahtsahlano, who inherited the chieftaincy of both peoples and established his residence at Snauq at the mouth of False Creek, now Vanier Park just west of the Burrard Bridge, rather than choose between residence at the Capilano Reserve or at Musqueam, as either of those would have had political implications for the one not chosen.
Once a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) station, Number 7 Supply Depot, the site was turned over to the Vancouver Park Board by the Federal Government on October 28, 1966. Named for former Governor General of Canada Georges Vanier, the park officially opened on May 30, 1967. The H.R. MacMillan Space Centre and the Vancouver Museum complex opened in 1968, thanks to lumber baron MacMillan’s $1.5 million donation.
Deputy Park Board Superintendent William Livingstone, famous for his landscape design for Queen Elizabeth Park and VanDusen Botanical Garden, increased the size of the original park site using tons of free fill from the excavation for the MacMillan Bloedel Building on Georgia Street. The fill added additional acres onto the park which was then landscaped by Livingstone and his crew.
Attractions.
Vanier Park plays host to several of Vancouver’s biggest summer festivals, including the International Children’s Festival and the Shakespearean Bard on the Beach. It is the biggest and most famous of the fifteen parks in Kitsilano.

Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase (film)

Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase is the fourth and last in a series of films starring Bonita Granville as teenage amateur detective Nancy Drew, Frankie Thomas as her boyfriend, and John Litel as her father. It was loosely based on the novel of the same name by Mildred Wirt Benson.
Plot.
The elderly Turnbull sisters want to donate their mansion for a children's hospital. However, their father's will states that at least one of them has to stay in the house every night for twenty years before they can inherit the estate; there are two weeks left to go. 
Then some strange things start occurring. A stranger forces his way past Nancy Drew (Bonita Granville) and brazenly searches the Drew house for related affidavits her lawyer father Carson (John Litel) has obtained. Then, the Turnbulls' chauffeur Phillips (Don Rowan) dies, though it is uncertain if it was a murder or a suicide. The frightened old ladies consider leaving their home. When Nancy recognizes the dead man as the trespasser, she begins investigating, dragging her boyfriend Ned Nickerson (Frankie Thomas) into one predicament after another, eventually getting him fired and jailed. 
When police Captain Tweedy (Frank Orth) arrests the two sisters for Phillips' murder, their ownership is endangered. Just in time, Nancy and Ned discover a secret passageway in the basement linking it to the neighboring house, owned by Daniel Talbert (William Gould). Talbert would make a lot of money if a racetrack were to be built on the two properties, but the Turnbulls had turned down an offer to buy their place.
The movie contains at least one continuity error. The children's hospital is the "realization" of a "lifelong" dream of Dr. Spires. If you watch the movies in order, Dr. Spires is killed in Nancy Drew: Detective.

Martin S

__NOTOC__
The Martin S was a two-seat observation seaplane produced in the United States in 1915. Designed along the same general lines as the preceding Model T, it was a largely conventional two-bay biplane with unstaggered wings of equal span. The fuselage was not directly attached to the lower wings, but was carried on struts in the interplane gap. The undercarriage consisted of a single large pontoon below the fuselage and outrigger floats near the wingtips. The Model S was 23-year-old Donald Douglas's first and only design for the Martin company, and it set three world altitude records and a flight duration record that stood for three years.
Six, possibly fourteen, of these aircraft were operated by the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps, and another two by the United States Navy. All of the Army aircraft, S.C. 56-59 and 94-95, were assigned to the first U.S. aviation unit based overseas, the 1st Company, 2d Aero Squadron at Fort Mills, Corregidor, in March and April 1916, where they used a radio transmitter with a range of 29 miles to adjust battery fire for the Coast Artillery.

Ghosts of the American Civil War

There is speculation over the alleged existence of ghosts from the American Civil War. Among the locales that have become famous for Civil War ghosts are the Sharpsburg battlefield near Sharpsburg, Maryland; Chickamauga battlefield in Georgia; Harper's Ferry, West Virginia; Buras, Louisiana; and Warren, Arkansas.
Gettysburg.
The Battle of Gettysburg was the largest battle in North America. Fittingly, it has many ghost stories. The Soldiers' Orphanage cellar is said to make even psychics too afraid to enter the house, due to its legend. The Herr Tavern was built in 1815, but during the battle it was used as the first Confederate hospital at Gettysburg, where amputations often resulted in limbs being thrown out through the window to be collected later, only for many of the soldiers to die afterward. As a result, four of the guest rooms are said to be haunted, and the rooms are numbered so that there is no room 13.
The interest of ghosts and Gettysburg remains to the present day. In recent times, people have claimed to seen ghost soldiers, and sometimes even ghost battles, in many places around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Eight separate companies offer ghost tours in Gettysburg—some seasonally, and some all year.
Other battlefields.
A battle did not need to be major to have ghosts associated with it. The Battle of Kolb Farm is believed to have created a ghost that haunts a farmhouse in northern Georgia.
One of the bloodiest battles was the Battle of Sharpsburg. Both Union and Confederate Ghosts have reportedly been seen placing and firing
at each other with artillery on the battlefield.
Lincoln's Ghost.
Abraham Lincoln has long been said to haunt the White House. First Lady Grace Coolidge, wife of President Calvin Coolidge, was the first to claim to spot Lincoln's ghost. She claimed to see Lincoln looking at the Potomac River sadly from the Oval Office. Carl Sandburg claimed to have "sensed" Lincoln do the same as well. Both Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and Eleanor Roosevelt both allegedly saw Lincoln's ghost during World War II in the Lincoln Bedroom (Lincoln's office during the war); the Queen admitted to fainting after seeing Lincoln in his top hat. Margaret Truman heard a tapping sound attributed to the ghost so often that Harry Truman ordered the White House renovated. Gerald Ford's daughter Susan Ford made a point of never sleeping in the Lincoln Bedroom, out of fear of Lincoln's ghost. Maureen Reagan claimed to see Lincoln's ghost in the Lincoln Bedroom as well during the administration of her father, Ronald Reagan . Others who have sensed or reportedly seen Lincoln's ghost were Harry Truman and Fala.
Lincoln's son Willie died during Lincoln's Presidency. A White House maid during Ulysses S. Grant's administration reported seeing the ghost of the dead boy.
Lincoln's ghost has reportedly been seen outside of the White House as well. In Loundonville, New York, Lincoln's ghost is said to haunt a house that was owned by a woman who was present at Ford's Theatre when Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth. Other Lincoln hauntings include his grave in Springfield, Illinois, a portrait of Mary Todd Lincoln and a phantom train on nights in April along the same path his funeral train followed from Washington, D.C. to Springfield.
Elsewhere.
The Beauregard-Keyes House in New Orleans is said to be haunted by the ghost of Confederate general P.G.T. Beauregard and an entire regiment of ghost soldiers reenacting the Battle of Shiloh, perhaps Beauregard's worst defeat and a battle that took place 415 miles away in southwest Tennessee.

List of New York Giants Opening Day starting pitchers

The New York Giants were a Major League Baseball team that played in Manhattan, New York until moving to San Francisco in 1958. From 1883 until their move to San Francisco, they played their home games at the Polo Grounds. They played in the National League. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Giants used 33 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 75 seasons they played in New York. The Giants won 39 of those games against 35 losses in those Opening Day starts. They also played one tie game.
Carl Hubbell had the most Opening Day starts for the New York Giants with six between 1929 and 1942. Mickey Welch, Amos Rusie and Larry Jansen each had five Opening Day starts for the team. Christy Mathewson, Red Ames, Jeff Tesreau and Bill Voiselle all had four Opening Day starts apiece for the Giants. Ed Doheny and Johnny Antonelli each had three Opening Day starts for the New York Giants and Antonelli also had an Opening Day start for the San Francisco Giants in 1959, giving him a total of four Opening Day starts for the franchise. Antonelli is the only player to have an Opening Day start for both the New York and San Francisco Giants.
Other pitchers who had multiple Opening Day starts for the New York Giants were Hal Schumacher with three such starts, and Joe McGinnity, Rube Marquard, Jesse Barnes, Art Nehf, Virgil Barnes, Bill Walker and Sal Maglie with two apiece. Seven Hall of Fame pitchers made Opening Day starts for the New York Giants — Welch, Tim Keefe, Rusie, Mathewson, McGinnity, Marquard and Hubbell.
The New York Giants won the modern World Series five times, in , , , and . Their Opening Day starting pitchers in those years were Joe McGinnity in 1905, Phil Douglas in 1921, Art Nehf in 1922, Carl Hubbell in 1933 and Sal Maglie in 1954. In , the Giants won the National League championship but no World Series was played. Christy Mathewson was the Giants' Opening Day starting pitcher that season. The Giants also won the 19th century World Series twice, in 1888 and 1889. Cannonball Titcomb and Mickey Welch were the Giants Opening Day starting pitchers in 1888 and 1889, respectively.
Jesse and Virgil Barnes, who each made two Opening Day starts for the New York Giants, were brothers.

Victor Amadeus of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym

Victor Amadeus of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym (Schaumburg, 21 May 1744 – 2 May 1790), was a German prince of the House of Ascania from the Anhalt-Bernburg branch through the sub-branch of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym and a Russian General under the service of Empress Catherine II the Great.
He was the sixth (but fifth surviving) son of Victor I Amadeus Adolph, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym, and the third-born by his second wife, Countess Hedwig Sophie Henckel of Donnersmarck.
Life.
As the youngest of the sons of Prince Victor I, Victor Amadeus had little chances to inherit any of the family lands. He thus chose to follow a military career and entered in the Russian army in 1772.
On 10 July 1775 Victor Amadeus was appointed Major General and four months later, on 26 November, he was awarded with the Order of Saint George IV Class for his remarkable services. On 28 June 1782 he was appointed Lieutenant General.
Since the beginning of the Turkish campaign of Prince Potemkin, in 1788, Victor Amadeus entered in his army and distinguished himself in the Battle of Ochakov, where he was commander of the first two columns during the assault and put them on the walls of the fortress; for this, he was awarded on 16 December 1788 with the Order of Saint George II Class.
The following year, Victor Amadeus took an active part in the capture of the towns of Căuşeni, Akkerman and Bender, and was rewarded for his distinction with the Orders of St. Alexander Nevsky and St. Andrew
In 1790 the Prince joined to the army of Count Ivan Saltykov in Finland, the theater of the Russo-Swedish War. This was his last military action: at the beginning of hostilities, Victor Amadeus sent a detachment to drive the enemy from Pardakoski and Kernikoski and, on 18 April, while the troops were attacking the Swedish, he was fatally wounded in his right leg, and was forced to leave the field battle, dying several days later.
The name of the Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym was closely linked with the famous Russian general Barclay de Tolly, who began active service under his direct command. Victor Amadeus was the first one who drew attention to the military talents of Barclay; when the Prince was dying, he gave to Barclay his sword, with which he never parted.
Marriage and issue.
In Schaumburg on 21 April 1778 Victor Amadeus married Magdalena Sophie (b. Braunfels, 4 June 1742 - d. Homburg vor der Höhe, 21 January 1819), daughter of Frederick William, Prince of Solms-Braunfels. They had one son:

Schiappa Branch Library

The Schiappa Library is a public library located in Steubenville, Ohio. It is a branch of the Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County (PLSJ), which services a large area in southeast Ohio – otherwise known as the Ohio Valley. Besides the Schiappa Library, PLSJ has branches all over Jefferson County, Ohio located in Toronto, Brilliant, Tiltonsville, Dillonvale and Adena with the Main Library located in Steubenville. The Schiappa branch is located at the west end of Steubenville on the <br>Fort Steuben Mall property. It not only serves as an additional library for the city of Steubenville, but also as a library for the neighboring village of Wintersville, Ohio.
History.
The Schiappa Branch Library opened its doors on February 2, 1987 in the west end of Steubenville, Ohio at 4141 Mall Drive, where it still sits on property donated by the Siciliano family. This plot of land was one of many looked at in the time leading up to a final decision, but it was this area’s location being adjacent to a large shopping center attracting people from all over the Ohio Valley that made it so desirable. Huberta Siciliano made it clear that if she donated the land to the library, she would like the facility to be named after her parents: Albert and Mary A. Schiappa. 
One concern with the property that the Schiappa Library now sits upon was that the land was a former strip-mining area. This caused many to note that the foundation would be in danger of cracking and heaving once the pyrites swelled with moisture. To resolve this, the library was built upon 110 concrete pylons, drilled to solid rock, which is between 4 to 14 feet deep at the site. 
When the library first opened, most shelves had very few books on them and it often seemed like everything was checked out. To remedy this, returned books were shelved quickly and the State Regional Library sent over boxes of books to make the shelves more full temporarily. Over the years, the collection of books has grown exponentially to include videotapes, DVDs, CDs, audio books, periodicals, and graphic novels.
Renovations.
By 1990, the collection at Schiappa Branch Library had grown so large that talk of expanding the building had begun. A larger children’s area was needed, more reference shelving would be required, and the collection in Schiappa’s Ohio History and Genealogy room was beginning to take up more space than the shelves could fit. There was also talk of adding a conference room, a children’s activity room, and offices for the branch manager. The project went forward in 1992 and the library was renovated with all of the above changes while the building itself stayed open to the public. An extra wing was added for the children’s area and activity room, a conference room and three study rooms were built, offices for the branch manager and extra workspaces were added behind the Circulation desk, and the Reference and Genealogy departments were given their own closed in space for quiet studying and for keeping reference materials from leaving the room. 
Beginning in 2007, plans were drawn up for another renovation project. This time, it was the front lobby and adult fiction/nonfiction areas that would be getting a makeover. New flooring was put into the front lobby and periodical section. New furniture was brought in, including new desks, workspaces, chairs and a counter for the Circulation department. Vending machines were added beside new study areas for a more modern and customer friendly look. The project was essentially complete in spring of 2008.
Departments.
General Circulation
The Circulation department is located in the front lobby of the library. Items may be returned or taken out at the circulation desk. Borrowers may also pick up items that have been placed on hold (brought in from other libraries). The library assistants at Circulation will help you locate items throughout the building or assist in ordering items that are not currently stocked. A borrower may also take care of any pending overdue fines in this department.
Children/Teens
Located in the rear of the Schiappa Library, this area includes a listening center for audio books, toys for young ones, couches for parents, a youthful reading area for teens and several desks for studying and activities. There is also an activity room used for hosting children’s programming and large group activities.
Reference
The Reference department is mostly for quiet study and Internet usage. The room is equipped with eight computers wired to the Internet. The computers use timed software to allow each borrower up to an hour and twenty minutes of Internet time each day. The Reference staff will assist in technical support, troubleshooting, and will answer questions both in person and online through the Meebo chat service. The Reference librarian will also assist in ordering material not currently in the libraries database.
Ohio Room/Genealogy
The Ohio History/Genealogy department is unique to the Schiappa Branch Library. Nowhere else in the Jefferson County library system will one find this information. The room is filled with books not only helping with basic genealogy techniques, but also books specific to the Steubenville and Jefferson County region that the library serves. The collection consists of birth, death and marriage records, newspaper clippings, photo albums, high school yearbooks, and United States census materials, among other things. There is also a large collection the Steubenville area’s local newspaper, The "Herald-Star", dating back to the early 19th century on microfilm. The genealogist on duty can assist in using these materials as well as the wide variety of online materials.
Services and Programs.
The Schiappa Branch offers many free services, such as public notaries on duty during working hours, Internet access, Wi-Fi availability, and beginner computer instruction. The library also houses public copy machines and printers for a fee. 
The library offers many programs for people of all ages. Children can visit the Tot Time, Babygarten, and Story Hour programs. Teen programs include bi-monthly videogame nights and an all-ages movie is shown once a month. Adult programs vary from month to month, but have – in the past – included wine tasting, cooking demonstrations, and author visits. For a complete list of upcoming programs, the library’s website can be visited or customers can take a schedule from the circulation department.

Isopropylbenzylamine

Isopropylbenzylamine is a chemical compound used as an intermediate in the pharmaceutical industry as a precursor to the manufacture of some drugs. It has recently come to the attention of the DEA due to its use by illicit methamphetamine manufacturers as a diluting agent which is very similar in appearance and physical properties to methamphetamine and is cheap and not currently illegal. Isopropylbenzylamine is a structural isomer of methamphetamine, and has the same molar mass. It is also a secondary amine like methamphetamine, and forms salts in the same way. Consequently it looks very similar to methamphetamine and has a similar melting point, and can be used to dilute methamphetamine without this being obvious to users, although some subtle differences such as slightly higher melting point and softer crystals may be apparent. Isopropylbenzylamine is not thought to have any stimulant effects in its own right however, and its toxicity is unknown. Other "cutting agents" found to have been used for methamphetamine include the related compounds methylbenzylamine and ethylbenzylamine, as well as dimethylsulfone.

Prince Franz Adolph of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym

Franz Adolph of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym (Schaumburg Castle, 7 July 1724 – Halle an der Saale, 22 April 1784), was a German prince of the House of Ascania from the Anhalt-Bernburg branch through the sub-branch of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym.
He was the fourth (but third surviving) son of Victor I Amadeus Adolph, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym, by his first wife Charlotte Louise, daughter of William Maurice, Count of Isenburg-Büdingen-Birstein.
Life.
The death of his elder surviving brother the Hereditary Prince Christian in 1758 made Franz Adolph the heir presumptive of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym, preceded only by his other older brother and new heir, Karl Louis. He retained his position as heir presumptive until the birth of Karl Louis's first son, Victor Karl Frederick, in 1767.
Marriage and issue.
In Nieder-Kaufung on 19 October 1762 Franz Adolph married Maria Josepha (b. 13 September 1741 - d. Halle, 2 December 1785), daughter of Count John Wolfgang of Hasslingen, from a Silesian noble family. She was raised to the rank of countess by the Emperor, which prompted Franz Adolph's brothers to ask the Reichshofrat for a declaration that this elevation would not be to their disadvantage in any way (4 September 1766); they were rebuffed (9 January 1767). The union produced seven children, who were considered dynasts:

Luck's Incorporated

Luck's Incorporated was a food production company founded in Seagrove, North Carolina, in 1947, which produced a line of canned bean and other canned food products. For a period of time, it was one of the largest employers in the area and its canned food products were a staple in many Southern homes. It is now a brand of Arizona Canning Company, after a recent divestment by ConAgra
History.
The company was originally founded as the Mountain View Cannery in 1947 by Ivey B. Luck, Alfred Spencer & H. Clay Presnell. Spencer & Presnell later sold out to Luck and the establishment became known as Luck's. Luck's specialized in pinto beans and other canned vegetables and food products, employed many Seagrove and surrounding area families, and was a major buyer of vegetable, fruit, and poultry farms in the Randolph County Area and from around the region. Luck's canned food products were sold across much of the Southeast during the 1950s and is still a popular brand today.
Merged and Acquired.
In 1967, Luck's merged with American Home Products. In 2000, the food interests of American Home Products, known as International Home Foods, were acquired by ConAgra Foods.
In 2011, the brand was sold to Arizona Canning Company for $14 million USD.

Driza Bone

Driza Bone is an international dance music / remixing musical ensemble, led by the record producers / musicians, Billy April and Vincent Garcia. They used various female vocalists to provide the vocal element to their output. Driza Bone (sometimes billed as Drizabone) were primarily popular in the early 1990s. They were named after the Driza-Bone brand of waterproof riding coats.
Career.
The most successful remix single was of the American R&B singer Shanice's 1991 single, "I Love Your Smile". It surpassed the success of the original track, reaching #2 on both the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.
Driza Bone's most popular track, as an artist, was the song "Real Love", which reached #16 on the UK Singles Chart in June 1991 When this record came out, Drizabone included April, Garcia, and singer Sophie Jones. Jones was soon replaced by Dee Heron, who appeared on the single "Catch the Fire" (UK #54).
Heron was replaced by Kymberley Peer for "Pressure" (UK #33), "Brightest Star" (UK #45), and a re-release of "Real Love" in 1995 (UK #24, their biggest hit since the original version of the track). Driza Bone also had a charting album in 1994, titled "Conspiracy", which debuted and peaked at #72 on the UK Albums Chart in November of that year. All of their chart successes were released on the Fourth & Broadway record label.
In 2010, Billy April, now credited under his real name Billy Freeman, revived the project under the name The Drizabone Soul Family, releasing an album titled "All the Way" with a new line-up of vocalists. The band's latest album, "The Recipe Of Life", was released in 2012.

Differential pulley

A differential pulley, also called "Weston differential pulley", sometimes "chain hoist" or colloquially "chain fall", is used to manually lift very heavy objects like car engines. It is operated by pulling upon the slack section of a continuous chain that wraps around pulleys. The relative size of two connected pulleys determines the maximum weight that can be lifted by hand. 
History.
The differential pulley was invented in 1854 by Thomas Aldridge Weston from King's Norton, England.
The pulleys were manufactured in collaboration with Richard and George Tangye. According to Richard Tangye's autobiography, the Weston differential pulley evolved from the Chinese windlass, with an endless chain replacing the finite length of rope. He claimed that many engineering firms conceded on the difficulty of efficiently disengaging the chain from the teeth as the pulleys turned, but his firm developed a "pitch" chain which solved the issue. Marketed as "Weston Differential Pulley Blocks with Patent Chain Guides", the pulley had good sales, namely, 3000 sets in 9 months. It was displayed in 5 sizes — from to — at the 1862 International Exhibition in London and received a medal for "original application, practical utility and success".
An ironmonger challenged the Tangyes that the pulley had been in use for 30 years before Weston's patent but the judge, William Page Wood ruled in favour of the Tangyes because the engaging mechanism was substantially different from the one presented as evidence.
The Yale Lock Company acquired the patent rights in 1876.
Mode of operation.
A differential pulley can lift very large masses a short distance. It consists of two fixed pulleys of unequal radii that are attached to each other and rotate together, a single pulley bearing the load, and an endless rope looped around the pulleys. To avoid slippage, the rope is usually replaced by a chain, and the connected pulleys by sprockets.
The two sections of chain carrying the single pulley exert opposing and unequal torques on the connected pulleys, such that only the "difference" of these torques has to be compensated manually by pulling the loose part of the chain.
This leads to a mechanical advantage: the force needed to lift a load is only a fraction of the load's weight. At the same time, the distance the load is lifted is smaller than the length of chain pulled by the same factor. This factor (the mechanical advantage "MA") depends on the relative difference of the radii "r" and "R" of the connected pulleys:
The effect on the forces and distances (see figure) is quantitatively:
The difference in radii can be made very small, making the mechanical advantage of this pulley system very large.
In the extreme case of zero difference in radii, "MA" becomes infinite, thus no force (besides friction) is needed to move the chain, but moving the chain will no longer lift the load.
At the other extreme, when "r" is zero, the system becomes a simple "gun tackle" with a mechanical advantage of 2.
The same principle is used in a differential windlass, where the connected pulleys are replaced by winches.
Calculation of mechanical advantage.
In the above graphic, the four segments of the chain are labelled W, X, Y and Z. The magnitudes of their corresponding forces are "F"W, "F"X, "F"Y and "F"Z, respectively.
Assuming that the chain is massless, "F"X = 0 because segment X is not supporting any weight.
Taking the system at equilibrium, "F"W and "F"Y are equal — if they were not, the lower pulley would freely turn until they were.
Next, the downward force acting on the lower pulley equal the upward forces acting on it, so
Additionally, there is no net torque or moment around the compound pulley, so the clockwise torque is equal to the anticlockwise torque:
Substituting "F"X and "F"Y from the above equations,
Rearranging gives
As "F"W = ,
Finally, the mechanical advantage, =  or  .

Mosque No. 7 was the mosque in Harlem where Malcolm X preached until he left the Nation of Islam in 1964.
Opened as Temple No. 7 of the Nation of Islam at the Harlem YMCA in 1946, it was moved to Lenox Casino at 102 West 116th Street on the southwest corner of Lenox Avenue and it "was just a storefront in 1954 when Malcolm was named minister by Elijah Muhammad." When Malcolm X split from Elijah Muhammad in 1964, he opened a mosque named Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood at 130 West 113th Street. 
Temple No. 7 was destroyed in a bombing in 1965, after Malcolm X's assassination, which forced Nation of Islam to move it to 106 West 127th Street. The temple was also renamed to Muhammad's Mosque Number Seven by the Nation of Islam .
Later Muslims in the destroyed temple's area rebuilt the structure as a proper mosque. The building was redesigned by Sabbath Brown and the mosque was renamed in honour of Malcolm X as Malcolm Shabazz Mosque or Masjid Malcolm Shabazz. In 1972, it was the location of a controversial police shooting. The new mosque has no affiliation with the Nation of Islam.

Peter P. Straub

Peter P. Straub (Born 28 June 1850 in Felldorf Starzach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) is the founder of the Straub Brewery in St. Mary's, Pennsylvania.
Life and career.
Born to Anton Straub and his wife, Anna Maria Eger. The Straub family had been brewing a local beer for generations. As expected Peter learned a trade important to the brewing art. He became a Cooper, a craftsman who makes wooden barrels. Peter aspired to be a brewer and at the age of 19 in 1869 immigrated to the United States for a better and more prosperous life. Upon his arrival in the United States he found employment at the Eberhardt and Ober Brewing Company in Pennsylvania. Peter admired his employers' pledge to forfeit $1,000 if any adulteration was found in their beer, and as he honed his brewing skills to a sharp edge, he adhered faithfully to this promise. Eventually he tired of city life and moved north to Brookville, where he perfected his brewing process while working in the Christ and Algeir Brewery.
Peter later moved to Benzinger (St. Marys), where he met and married Sabina Sorg of Benzinger. The couple settled in Benzinger and had ten children: Francis X., Joseph A., Anthony A., Anna M., Jacob M., Peter M. (who died at two years of age), Peter P., Gerald B., Mary C., and Alphons J.
Peter's employment in Benzinger was with the Joseph Windfelder Brewery and he worked there until he purchased the Benzinger Spring Brewery (founded by Captain Charles C. Volk in 1855) from his father-in-law, Francis Xavier Sorg. It was then that Straub Beer and the Straub Brewery was born.

Diisopinocampheylborane

Diisopinocampheylborane is an organoborane that is useful for asymmetric synthesis. This colourless solid is the precursor to a range of related reagents. The compound was reported in 1961 by Zweifel and Brown in a pioneering demonstration of asymmetric synthesis using boranes. The reagent is mainly used for the synthesis of chiral secondary alcohols.
Preparation.
Diisopinocampheylborane was originally prepared by hydroboration of excess α-pinene with borane, but it is now more commonly generated from borane-methyl sulfide (BMS).
Structure, general properties, reactions.
The compound can be isolated as a solid, but it is quite sensitive to water and air and is thus often generated in situ and used as a solution. Oxidation of diisopinocampheylborane yields isopincampheol. It adds to alkenes and alkynes to form the corresponding alkyl- and vinyldiisopinocampheylboranes, where G is CHR and R is Ipc and H:
Diisopinocampheylborane is monomeric, in contrast to diborane and many of its less bulky derivatives that contain B-H bonds. Because of the large size of the α-pinenyl groups, diisopinocampheylborane does not hydroborate hindered alkenes but when it does add, it does so with high enantioselectivity, even for small L's. 2-Butene, 2-pentene, 3-hexene are converted with Diisopinocampheylborane to the respective chiral alcohols in high ee's. Norbornene under the same conditions gave an 83% ee, due to the additional steric effects involved. Hetrocycles (dihydrofuran, dihydrothiophene, dihydropyrrole, tetrahydropyran) give the alcohol in ≥99% ee; the high ee's reflect their contrained conformations. In a highly stereoselective reaction, allyldiisopinocampheylboranes converts aldehydes to the homologated alcohols, rapidly even at -100 °C.
The alkyldiisopinocampheylboranes, which result from the addition to alkenes, usefully react with a range of different reagents. Hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid provides 3-pinanamine. Hydroboration of 2-butene with diisopinocampheylborane followed by oxidation gives "R"-(-)-2-butanol in 87% ee.
Also useful, reaction with an aldehyde gives a chiral boronic ester, which can be further used is a number of reactions e.g. Suzuki reaction.
Related campheylboranes.
Treatment of diisopinocampheylborane with TMEDA give the crystalline adduct of monoisopinocampheylborane. This adduct reacts with boron trifluoride to liberate the monoisopinocampheylborane (IpcBH2) in 100% ee. Monoisopinocampheylborane reacts with a variety of alkenes. Two other reagents have been developed for the hydroboration of ketones:
In the above mechanism where G=O and R is Ipc and Cl or 9-Borabicyclononane. Diisopinocampheylchloroborane (Ipc2BCl) is produced by treating diisopinocampheylborane with hydrogen chloride. The chloride is reported to be more stable that the trialkyl boranes, it works well with aryl alkyl ketones and "tert"-butyl aklyl ketones. diisopinocampheylchloroborane is often complementary with diisopinocampheylborane, where one provides the "R" enantiomer and the other the "S", the enantioselectivity is typically very high.
Alpine-borane is produced by hydroborating α-pinene with 9-borabicyclononane. Both of these reagents can be improved upon by using 2-ethylapopinene in place of α-pinene, 2-ethylapopinene has an ethyl group in place of the methyl in α-pinene. The additional steric bulk improves the stereoselectivity of the reduction.
Diisopinocampheylborane reacts with methanol to give diisopinocampheylmethoxyborane, which in turn reacts with an allyl or crotyl Grignard reagent to give "B"-allyldiisopinocampheylborane, this can the undergo an asymmertric allylboration to give a chiral homologated alcohol which is a useful building block in a chiral synthesis.

Kid Glove Killer

Kid Glove Killer is a 1942 crime film starring Van Heflin as a criminologist investigating the murder of a mayor. The B film was the feature-length directorial debut of Fred Zinnemann.
Plot Summary.
Ambitious young attorney Gerald I. Latimer helps the sitting Mayor Daniels and district attorney Turnely to get re-elected, since they have agreed to help rid the city from the recent series of rackets.
The two re-elected officials are unaware that Gerald has paired up with one of the city's biggest gangsters, Matty, to get help in getting him elected to the U.S. Senate. In return the gangster will gain political favors from Gerald once he is elected.
The district attorney seems to be causing more trouble than expected, and Gerald has to get rid of him with Matty's help. Subsequently the district attorney is soon found dead and murdered. Gerald takes his place as a temporary district attorney, and gets to meet the crew that investigates the district attorney's murder. His good old friend and chemist Gordon McKay andhis assistant, Jane Mitchell, examine the body and are able to tell that the murderer is one Allison Stacy. When the police try to arrest Allison she is shot and killed because of her resistance.
A restaurant owner by the name of Eddie Wright, who has had enough of being harassed by the racketeers, visits the mayor's office, volunteering to help fight the criminals. Since the police take him for a hobo, he is taken into custody and questioned.
Gerald is questioned by the mayor about a large insurance policy he has bought, and wants to know where the money comes from. Gerald is worried that the mayor will find out about his dealings with the gangsters and decides to get rid of him too. He places a bomb in the mayor's car, and the mayor dies when the bomb goes off.
The police suspect hobo Eddie of being the perpetrator placing the bomb in the car, and arrest him. Some evidence actually leads to Eddie, since the fibers in his coat match the ones found in the mayor's car. Gordon is skeptical about the evidence and continues the investigation although Gerald calls for Eddie's arrest. 
Gerald spends a lot of time in the police crime lab and eventually falls in love with Jane. He even asks her hand in marriage, but she rejects him, explaining she can't marry and quit her job until this double homicide investigation is finished. She tells him Gordon has concluded that the man planting the bomb should have gun powder under his nails.
Gerald rushes off to scrub his hands meticulously, but Gordon later finds a note in the mayor's office, indicating that Gerald is the real killer. He suspects Gerald of both the murders, and calls on Gerald totry to get a hair sample from him.
After getting the sample, Gordon tells Jane he has found the killer, but he won't reveal his name. When Jane and Jerry meet again and she agrees to marry him, she tells Gerald that Gordon has found the killer through a hair sample. Gerald realizes he has to kill his old friend Gordon.
Geraldgoes on to set up a meeting with him, Gordon and Matty, and gives his car keys to Jane so she can drive herself home. She sees the cigar cutter on the key ring and realizes it could have been used to cut bomb wires. She brings it with her to the crime lab for examination.
Gerald gets a gun from Matty and shows him how to use it. He rushes to the crime lab to kill Gordon. When he enters Gordon's office he asks the chemist to hand over the evidence incriminating him, and Jane overhears the shouting from the lab.
Gerald is confessing the killings to Gordon when Jane enters the office. Gordon then manages to overpower Gerald and get the gun. The police arrive to the scene shortly after, and both Gerald and Matty are soon arrested. Gordon realizes he is in love with Jane and proposes to her. She willingly accepts.
Reception.
The film earned $336,000 in the US and Canada and $214,000 elsewhere during its initial theatrical run, making MGM a profit of $161,000.

<doc id="19868945" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19868945" title="Rhinemaidens">
Rhinemaidens

The Rhinemaidens are the three water-nymphs ("Rheintöchter" or "Rhine daughters") who appear in Richard Wagner's opera cycle "Der Ring des Nibelungen". Their individual names are Woglinde, Wellgunde, and Flosshilde (Floßhilde), although they are generally treated as a single entity and they act together accordingly. Of the 34 characters in the "Ring" cycle, they are the only ones who did not originate in the Old Norse "Eddas". Wagner created his Rhinemaidens from other legends and myths, most notably the "Nibelungenlied" which contains stories involving water-sprites (nixies) or mermaids. The key concepts associated with the Rhinemaidens in the "Ring" operas—their flawed guardianship of the Rhine gold, and the condition (the renunciation of love) through which the gold could be stolen from them and then transformed into a means of obtaining world power—are wholly Wagner's own invention, and are the elements that initiate and propel the entire drama.
The Rhinemaidens are the first and the last characters seen in the four-opera cycle, appearing both in the opening scene of "Das Rheingold", and in the final climactic spectacle of "Götterdämmerung", when they rise from the Rhine waters to reclaim the ring from Brünnhilde’s ashes. They have been described as morally innocent, yet they display a range of sophisticated emotions, including some that are far from guileless. Seductive and elusive, they have no relationship to any of the other characters, and no indication is given as to how they came into existence, beyond occasional references to an unspecified "father".
The various musical themes associated with the Rhinemaidens are regarded as among the most lyrical in the entire "Ring" cycle, bringing to it rare instances of comparative relaxation and charm. The music contains important melodies and phrases which are reprised and developed elsewhere in the operas to characterise other individuals and circumstances, and to relate plot developments to the source of the narrative. It is reported that Wagner played the Rhinemaidens' lament at the piano, on the night before he died in Venice, in 1883.
Origins.
Alone of the "Ring's" characters, the Rhinemaidens do not originate from the "Poetic Edda" or "Prose Edda", the Icelandic sources for most of Norse mythology. Water-sprites (German: "Nixen") appear in many European myths and legends, often but not invariably in a form of disguised malevolence. Wagner drew widely and loosely from those legends when compiling his "Ring" narrative, and the probable origin of his Rhinemaidens is in the German "Nibelungenlied". In one part of the "Nibelungenlied" narrative Hagen and Gunther encounter certain "wise women" (thereafter described as water-sprites), bathing and refreshing themselves in the waters of the Danube. Hagen creeps softly towards them, but he is seen, whereupon the sprites retreat and mock him from a distance. Hagen then steals their clothes. To obtain the return of these, one of the sprites, Hadeburg, promises falsely that Hagen and Gunther will find honor and glory when they enter Etzel's kingdom. After their clothes are returned, another sprite, Sigelinde (a name Wagner would adopt again for use elsewhere), tells Hagen that her sister has lied. If they go to Etzel’s land, they will die there.
This story, itself unrelated to the "Ring" drama, is echoed by Wagner both in the opening "Das Rheingold" scene and in the first scene in Act III of "Götterdämmerung". Wagner first adapted the story for use in his early libretto of "Siegfried's Death" (which eventually became "Götterdämmerung"), introducing three unnamed water-maids ("Wasserjungfrauen"), and locating them in the Rhine, where they warn Siegfried of his impending death. Later these water-maids became Rhinemaidens ("Rheintöchter"), and were given individual names: Flosshilde, Wellgunde, and Bronnlinde. As Wagner continued working on his reverse chronology from Siegfried's death, he arrived at what he determined was the initial act of the drama — Alberich's theft of the Rhine gold. Believing that a simple abduction of the unguarded gold would lack dramatic force, Wagner made the Rhinemaidens the guardians of the gold, and he introduced the "renunciation of love" condition. Bronnlinde became Woglinde, probably to avoid confusion with Brünnhilde.
Wagner may also have been influenced by the Rhine River-based German legend of Lorelei, the lovelorn young maiden who drowns herself in the river and becomes a siren, luring fishermen onto the rocks by her singing. Further possible sources lie in Greek mythology and literature. Similarities exist between the maiden guardians in the Hesperides myth and the Rhinemaidens of "Das Rheingold"; three females guard a highly desired golden treasure that is stolen in the telling of each tale. Wagner was an enthusiastic reader of Aeschylus, including his "Prometheus Bound" which has a chorus of Oceanids or water nymphs. One author, Rudolph Sabor, sees a link between the Oceanids' treatment of Prometheus and the Rhinemaidens' initial tolerance of Alberich. Just as in Greek myth the Oceanids are the daughters of the titan sea god Oceanus, in Norse mythology—specifically the "Poetic Edda"—the jötunn (similar to a giant) sea god Ægir has nine daughters. The name of one of these means "wave" ("Welle" in German) and is a possible source for Wellgunde's name.
Wagner's operas do not reveal where the Rhinemaidens came from, or whether they have any connection to other characters. Whereas most of the characters in the cycle are inter-related, through birth, marriage, or sometimes both, the Rhinemaidens are seemingly independent. The identity of their father who entrusted them with the guardianship of the gold is not given in the text. Some Wagnerean scholars have suggested that he may be a "Supreme Being" who is the father of Wotan and all the gods—indeed, of all creation. Others take the German "Rheintöchter" literally and say that they are the daughters of the Rhine River. Whatever is surmised, the Rhinemaidens are in a different category from Wotan and the other gods, who are destroyed by fire at the end of "Götterdämmerung", while the Rhinemaidens swim happily away in the river, bearing their recovered treasure.
Nature and attributes.
The Rhinemaidens have been described as the drama’s "most seductive but most elusive characters", and in one analysis as representatives of "seduction by infantile fantasy". They act essentially as a unity, with a composite yet elusive personality. Apart from Flosshilde’s implied seniority, demonstrated by occasional light rebukes and illustrated musically by awarding the role to a deeper-voiced contralto or mezzo, their characters are undifferentiated. In "The Perfect Wagnerite", his 1886 analysis of the "Ring" drama as political allegory, George Bernard Shaw describes the Rhinemaidens as "thoughtless, elemental, only half-real things, very much like modern young ladies". The attributes most apparent initially are charm and playfulness, combined with a natural innocence; their joy in the gold they guard derives from its beauty alone, even though they know its latent power. However, this veneer of childlike simplicity is misleading; aside from proving themselves irresponsible as guardians, they are also provocative, sarcastic and cruel in their interaction with Alberich. When the demigod Loge reports that the Rhinemaidens need Wotan's help to regain the gold, Fricka, the goddess of marriage, calls them a "watery brood" ("Wassergezücht") and complains about the many men they have lured away with their "treacherous bathing". They are beguiling and flirtatious with Siegfried, but finally wise as revealed by the undisclosed counsel which they give to Brünnhilde. Sabor sees the personality of the Rhinemaidens as a blend of the "good hearted nature" of the Oceanids and the "austerity" (including the willingness to drown people) of the daughters of Ægir.
The first lines sung by Woglinde in the "Ring" are dominated by wordless vocalisations. "Weia! Waga! ... Wagala weia! Wallala weiala weia!" This attracted comment both at the 1869 premiere of "Rheingold" and the 1876 premiere of the entire "Ring", with Wagner's work being dismissed as "Wigalaweia-Musik". In a letter to Nietzsche dated 12 June 1872, Wagner explained that he had derived "Weiawaga" from old German and that it was related to "Weihwasser", meaning holy water. Other words were intended as parallels to those found in German nursery lullabies ('Eia Poppeia', 'Heija Poppeia' and 'Aia Bubbeie' are common forms). Thus Woglinde's lines portray both the childish innocence of the Rhinemaidens and the holiness of Nature.
The Rhinemaidens' sorrow in the loss of the gold is deep and heartfelt. As the gods are crossing the rainbow bridge into Valhalla at the end of "Das Rheingold", Loge ironically suggests that, in the absence of the gold, the maidens should "bask in the gods’ new-found radiance". The maidens' lament then becomes a stern reproof: ""Tender and true are only the depths"", they sing; ""False and cowardly is all that rejoices up there"". In the final "Götterdämmerung" scene they show ruthlessness as, having recovered the ring, they drag the hapless Hagen down into the waters of the Rhine.
The Rhinemaidens are the only prominent characters seen definitely alive at the end of the drama; the fates of a few others are ambiguous, but most have certainly perished. Despite the relative brevity of their roles in the context of the four-opera cycle, they are key figures; their careless guardianship of the gold and their provocation of Alberich are the factors which determine all that follows. Wagner himself devised the "renunciation of love" provision whereby the gold could be stolen and then used to forge a ring with power to rule the world. Since the ring is made from the stolen gold, only its restoration to the Rhinemaidens' care in the waters of the Rhine will lift the curse on it. Hence, the return of the stolen property provides a unifying thematic consistency to Wagner's complex story.

"Summaries drawn from Wagner's libretti as translated into English by William Mann, 1964"
Das Rheingold, Scene 1.
As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: "I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me". The wary Flosshilde cries: "Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: "Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: "Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens in the darkness, bewailing their loss.
Das Rheingold, Scene 4.
As Wotan, Fricka and the other gods start to cross the rainbow bridge leading to Valhalla, they hear a melancholy song from the depths of the Rhine—the maidens, mourning the loss of the gold. Embarrassed and irritated, Wotan tells Loge to silence the maidens, but as the gods continue across the bridge the sweet lament rises again, now with bitter words of reproach to the gods for their heartlessness, until their song is drowned out by the thunderous ostinato of the Entry of the Gods.
Götterdämmerung, Act 3 Scene 1.
Some time has passed (at least two generations). In a remote wooded valley where the Rhine flows, the ageless Rhinemaidens continue to mourn for the gold, pleading with the "Sun-woman" to send them a champion who will return the gold to them. Siegfried's horn is heard, and he soon appears, having lost his way while hunting. The maidens greet him with their old playfulness and offer to help him, for the price of the ring on his finger. After a flirtatious exchange, Siegfried offers, apparently sincerely, to give them the ring. But instead of wisely simply accepting his offer, the mood of the naive, formerly flirtaceous Rhinemaidens suddenly becomes solemn: they warn Siegfreid he will be killed that very day unless he delivers the ring to them. But brave Siegfried will never submit to any such implied threat and declares: "By threatening my life and limb, even if it weren't worth as much as a finger, you won't get the ring from me!" The maidens are scornful of his folly: "Farewell, Siegfried. A proud woman will today become your heir, scoundrel! She'll give us a better hearing". Siegfried is not aware that it is to Brünnhilde that they refer. They swim off, leaving a puzzled Siegfried to ponder their words and to admit to himself that he could happily have seduced any one of them.
Götterdämmerung, Act 3 Scene 3.
In her final soliloquy, Brünnhilde thanks the Rhinemaidens for their "good advice". We can presume that they have told her the full story of Siegfried's ensnarement and betrayal, and that only the return of the ring to the waters of the Rhine can lift its curse. Brünnhilde sings: "What you desire I will give you: from my ashes take it to yourselves. The fire...will cleanse the curse from the ring". She exhorts the Rhinemaidens to "carefully guard it" in the future, then leaps into the flames of Siegfried's pyre. As the Rhine overflows its banks the Rhinemaidens appear, making for the ring. Hagen, who covets the ring, shouts to them "Get back from the ring!" ("Zurück vom Ring!"), the last words of the drama. He is seized by Woglinde and Wellgunde and dragged into the Rhine's depths, as Flosshilde grabs the ring, holds it aloft, and joins her sisters "swimming in circles on the calm waters of the Rhine which is gradually returning to its bed".
Rhinemaidens' music.
The music associated with the Rhinemaidens has been portrayed by the Wagner commentator James Holman as "some of the seminal music in the "Ring""; other descriptions have noted its relative charm and relaxation. Its impact is immediate because the first music heard as the curtain rises on "Das Rheingold" is Woglinde's signature "Weia! Waga!" melody, which influences many themes and motives throughout the "Ring" cycle. Broadly, the Rhinemaidens' music falls under four main headings, all sharing melodic characteristics redolent of the river and the maidens themselves.
On stage.
From the first complete production of the "Ring", at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in 1876, it was established that the Rhinemaidens should be depicted in conventional human form, rather than as mermaids or with other supernatural features, notwithstanding Alberich's insult to Wellgunde: "Frigid bony fish!" ("Kalter, grätiger Fisch!"). The staging of their scenes has always been a test of ingenuity and imagination, since Wagner's stage directions include much swimming and diving and other aquatic gymnastics. Traditionally, therefore, much use has been made of backdrops and lighting to achieve the necessary watery effects. Until the Second World War, under the influence of Cosima Wagner and her (and Wagner's) son Siegfried, a policy of "stifling conservatism" was applied to Bayreuth stagings of the "Ring" operas. Although there had been some innovation in productions staged elsewhere, it was not until the postwar revival of the Festival in 1951 that there were any significant changes in Bayreuth's presentation of the "Ring" operas. Since 1976, in particular, innovation at the Festival and elsewhere has been substantial and imaginative.
In the original 1876 production, the Rhinemaidens were wheeled around on stands behind semi-transparent screens. The stage machinery and the lighting effects were designed by Carl Brandt, who was the foremost stage technician of the time. One innovation which Cosima did eventually approve was the replacement of the wheeled stands with giant, invisible "fishing rods" on which the Rhinemaidens were dangled. Wires continued to be used in the Bayreuth productions of Siegfried Wagner and, later, those of his widow Winifred, who ran the Bayreuth Festival until the end of the Second World War. Similar techniques have been used in more modern productions. In the 1996 Lyric Opera of Chicago "Ring" cycle, repeated in 2004–05, the Rhinemaidens were suspended on bungee cords anchored in the fly space above the stage, enabling them to dive up and down, as intended by Wagner. The Rhinemaidens were played on-stage by gymnasts, mouthing words sung by singers standing in a corner of the stage.
The 1951 Festival production, by Siegfried's and Winifred's son Wieland, broke with tradition and featured an austere staging which replaced scenery and props with skilful lighting effects. The Rhinemaidens, along with all the other characters, were plainly dressed in simple robes, and sang their roles without histrionics. Thus the music and the words became the main focus of attention. Wieland was influenced by Adolphe Appia, whose "Notes sur l'Anneau du Nibelungen" (1924–25) had been dismissed by Cosima: "Appia seems to be unaware that the "Ring" was performed here in 1876. It follows that the staging is definitive and sacrosanct." However, Wieland and his brother Wolfgang praised Appia: "... the stylised stage, inspired by the music and the realisation of three-dimensional space – constitute the initial impulses for a reform of operatic stagings which led quite logically to the 'New Bayreuth' style."
The innovative centenary Bayreuth "Ring", directed by Patrice Chéreau, did away altogether with the underwater concept by setting the Rhinemaiden scenes in the lee of a large hydro-electric dam, as part of a 19th-century Industrial Revolution setting for the operas. For the scene with Siegfried in "Götterdämmerung", Chéreau altered the perpetual youth aspect of the Rhine Maidens by depicting them as "no longer young girls merrily disporting themselves; they have become tired, grey, careworn, and ungainly". Since this production "the assumption of unrestricted interpretive license has become the norm". For example Nikolaus Lehnhoff, in his 1987 Bayerische Staatsoper production, placed the Rhinemaidens in a salon and had their lament at the end of "Rheingold" played on a gramophone by Loge.
Peter Hall directed the Bayreuth "Ring" after Chéreau. His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his "Ring" production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained "The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty." While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.
Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include Margarete Matzenauer who played Flosshilde in 1911 and Helga Dernesch who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967. Lotte Lehmann, who played Wellgunde at the Hamburg State Opera between 1912 and 1914 and the Vienna State Opera in 1916, and Joan Sutherland, who appeared as Woglinde at Covent Garden between 1954 and 1957, are two of the interpreters to have played Rheinmaidens in other major international opera houses. Recorded Rhinemaidens have included Sena Jurinac for Furtwängler and RAI, Lucia Popp and Gwyneth Jones for Georg Solti, and Helen Donath and Edda Moser for Karajan.

Australian Institute of Building

The Australian Institute of Building is a professional society founded in 1951, incorporated in 1955 and granted a Royal Charter in 1969. It has chapter offices in Hong Kong and Singapore and had a chapter office in New Zealand until the formation of the New Zealand Institute of Building in 1984.
Serving building professionals, it has helped create standards for professional competency and regulation of education standards for the various educational programs related to its mission. It has played the lead role in the establishment of all building and construction management undergraduate programs offered by Australian universities.
Founded in 1951, incorporated in 1955 and granted a Royal Charter in 1969, the Australian Institute of Building (AIB) is an association of building professionals, associate professionals and technicians engaged in building practice, teaching or research throughout Australia and overseas.
The mission of AIB is to be a leading body of focus for the building industry, valued for its services to its members, reflecting its ideals for education, standards and ethics and the source of authoritative and visionary comment on behalf of professionals in the industry. Its objectives are: to promote excellence in the construction of buildings and just and honourable practices in the conduct of business; to advance the study of Building and all kindred matters, arts and sciences; to encourage the friendly exchange between members of knowledge in practical, technical and ethical subjects; and to uphold the dignity of the profession of Building and the status of the Institute.
Following World War II the building industry was confronted with a huge programme of civil and commercial building. This called for improved productivity, more intelligent use of resources available and the development of new techniques and new material. Leaders of the industry appreciated that building was developing from empirical craft processes to a technological discipline spanning physical sciences and involving construction techniques which were unknown in the early part of the 20th Century. Development in the science of environment and building services had also added a new dimension to building technology.
As building involved investment of public and private capital to a greater extent than any other commodity, rational, economic and efficient working was essential. Skill in the management of building work is as important as the technology itself. A trend to higher educational standards and a more positive approach to training executive and technical staff of Building organisations was clearly required.
The effect of this impact on the building industry was to highlight the need for a professional body to promote efficiency and establish a high standard of technological education for those engaged on the construction side of the industry.
A 'Committee of Investigation' was set up in 1947 by a convention called by the then Master Builders' Federation of Australia (MBFA) which, although firmly established since 1890, was not acceptable as a professional body because it was an employers' organisation. There was agreement that an Institute should be constituted on professional lines to represent the construction side of the building industry, and both the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) and the Institution of Engineers Australia (IEAust) agreed to assist in selecting the foundation membership.
The Australian Institute of Builders was established in 1951 with a foundation membership determined by a selection committee in each state, comprising two representatives of the RAIA, one representative of the IEAust and two representatives of the MBFA. The Foundation Members also included members of the Building Diplomats Association of NSW, associated with the Sydney Technical College.
In 23 November 1951 the Foundation Dinner was held in Sydney and the then Mr Robert Menzies, Prime Minister of Australia, was presented with a Certificate of Honorary Membership.
The Institute was incorporated on 15 November 1955, granted Armorial Bearings on 20 August 1960 and incorporated by Royal Charter on 7 October 1969, despite the protests of the CIOB(UK). It had, on 26 May 1967, changed its name to The Australian Institute of Building (AIB).
Having established itself and received recognition accorded by a Royal Charter, the Institute began to redefine its educational requirements at Licentiate and Corporate grade.
It then set about ensuring that the then degree and certificate courses in building which were available met the standards which the Institute required. From this has developed a course assessment/qualification accreditation system which has proven to be of great value to academic institutions and the industry.
While graduates in building were recognised immediately by the private sector, recognition in the public sector was harder to achieve. The breakthrough came in 1977 with the recognition by the Public Service Board of Degrees in Building for the positions of Project Manager Class 1-3, Area Manager Class 1-3 and Construction Manager. Recognition of the AIB as a professional institute was accorded in the Commonwealth Gazette in March 1983. This approval, under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act, recognises Corporate members of the Institute as professionally qualified.
Since its establishment in 1968 the Australian Institute of Building Research and Education Foundation has funded developments in education and specific research projects. One of these projects determined the duties and responsibilities of, and the levels of competence required by, professionals and technicians in the Building industry. In 1990 the AIB became an Associate of the International Council for Building Research (CIB). The AIB Papers, a journal of refereed academic papers, has been published by the Institute since 1986.
The By-laws and Regulations were amended to allow for changes to grades of member in 1981, 1992 and 1997.
With the Foundation of a New Zealand Institute of Building (NZIOB) in 1984, the New Zealand Chapter of the AIB was closed down. The AIB continues to have a close relationship with NZIOB.
In 1997 the AIB became a foundation member of the International Association for the Professional Management of Construction (IAPMC).
So as to streamline management decisions, in 1996 the Council delegated most of its authority to an Executive Board of Management.
Pending development of industry wide competency based standards, the Institute produced standards for its own membership purposes. These standards are also used for assessing applicants for the National Building Professionals Register (NBPR) which the AIB launched in 1997. 
A Hong Kong Chapter and Singapore Chapter were established in 1998, and AIB's overseas operations expanded considerably ten years later.
AIB is also the convenor of the Australian Building and Construction Higher Education Round Table, the peak body to bring together the construction industry and Australian universities.
HRH Prince Philip is an Honorary Fellow.

SoundCulture

SoundCulture is a music festival, initiated by a group of artists and arts organizers in Sydney. Its goal is to advocate and develop culture of sound art emphasizing the varied and unique qualities of sonic activity taking place in the pan-Pacific geographical zone. Major festivals were held in Sydney (1991), Tokyo (1993), San Francisco (1996), Auckland (1999), and Perth (2004).
About.
SoundCulture activities grew out of the substantial and complex history of experimental sound sculpture, installation, performance and radio arts. They also work with current developments in sonic practice and emergent technologies. SoundCulture also takes a proactive role in developing a critical discourse in the sonic arts in conferences, seminars and publications. Local SoundCulture groups focus on the development of a sound culture in their region. They also integrate their activity at an international level by networking with other SoundCulture groups.
The continuity of SoundCulture events has to date been maintained by an International Steering Committee which is made up of artists, critics, and curators. This group is now developing towards a networked structure.
Event History.
Under the theme "Invisible Cities/Impossible Objects", the first SoundCulture festival was held in Sydney in October, 1991. Composed of exhibitions, performances, site-specific public art works, radio projects, and symposia, the festival featured sixty representatives from Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. Events included installations by Paul DeMarinis (USA), Minoru Sato (Japan) Nigel Helyer (Australia), performances by Anna Sabiel (Australia), Rodney Berry (Australia), a sonic taxi ride through Sydney, and a piece for ship horns in Sydney Harbor.
The second festival, SoundCulture Japan '93, held in Tokyo in November, 1993. Events took place at several sites including Theatre X, Kiryu Yurin-kan, the Kawasaki City Museum, Art Forum Yanaka, and the Tokyo Bunka Kakikan. It included works by Mamoru Fujieda (Japan), Douglas Kahn and Frances Dyson (USA/Australia), Chris Mann (Australia), Nigel Helyer (Australia) Phil Dadson (NZ), and Mineko Grimmer (Japan/USA).
SoundCulture 96 was held in April, 1996 in the San Francisco Bay area. Altogether the festival involved 32 arts organizations presenting events at 33 sites comprising 17 exhibitions, 10 panels, and 55 performances and other events. The festival featured the work of 228 artists from around the Pacific Region. SoundCulture 96 was easily the largest sound art festival ever held in the United States. The festival included representation of a number of differing areas of sound practice: sound sculpture and installation, radio and telephonic works, performance, acoustic ecology, noise, cultural theory in relation to sound, appropriation, high- and low-tech activities, educational events for kids, homemade sound instruments, sound works for public space, and sound for film. Read a review here [http://www.roving.net/texts/sc96eis.html].
SoundCulture 99, held in March, 1999 in Auckland, New Zealand, expanded on the territory covered in previous events by including the work of Maori, Samoan, and Indonesian artists. It was curated to emphasize the culture in SoundCulture - the distinct sound traditions, practices and environments that feed into contemporary sound practice and in doing so showcased the work of a number of artists from New Zealand and beyond.
SoundCulture (in conjunction with Tura New Music) curated the "Sonic Differences" component of the Biennale of Electronic Arts Perth in 2004 and the SoundCulture AudioLab at the Bundanon Trust 2008.
The organisation has recently re-modelled, and now embraces a nodal model, allowing smaller regional groups to form a network of SoundCulture groups.

USS Mobjack (AGP-7)

USS "Mobjack" (AVP-27/AGP-7) was a motor torpedo boat tender that served in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946.
Construction and early deployment.
"Mobjack" was laid down as a seaplane tender, AVP‑27, by Lake Washington Shipyard, Houghton Washington, on 25 February 1942 and launched on 2 August 1942, sponsored by Mrs. H. R. Peck. She was reclassified as a motor torpedo boat tender and redesignated AGP‑7 on 11 March 1943 and commissioned on 17 October 1943 with Commander D. B. Coleman in command.
Following shakedown off southern California, "Mobjack" departed San Diego, California, for the Southwest Pacific on 14 December 1943. Steaming via New Caledonia and the New Hebrides, she arrived at Rendova, British Solomon Islands, on 14 January 1944 to begin duty with Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons, South Pacific (SOPAC). She trained and supplied patrol torpedo boats (PT boats) in the New Georgia area until 6 March 1944, when she steamed to the Treasury Islands and thence to the motor torpedo boat base, Emirau, arriving on 23 March 1944. In mid‑May 1944 she returned to the Treasury Islands, where she overhauled PT boats and repaired and tended the motor gunboats (PGMs) and landing craft infantry gunboats (LCI(G)s) of Task Group 30.3 into July 1944.
Employed briefly in transporting spares and other materiel, she departed for British New Guinea on 23 July 1944, arriving at Dreger Harbor on 27 July 1944 to begin service under Commander, Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons, 7th Fleet. During the greater part of August 1944 she operated at Aitape Harbor, tending Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron (MTBRBon) 33 and providing assistance in salvage work. On 28 August 1944, she got underway for Mios Woendi, Netherlands New Guinea, in company with MTBRBon 33. Arriving there on 31 August 1944, she was engaged in fueling, provisioning and making final repairs to the PT boats of the squadron preparatory to sailing for Morotai as a unit of Task Group 70.1.
Morotai.
Arriving at Morotai on 16 September 1944, the day after the American landings there, she commenced tending the boats of her squadron and Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats assigned to air-sea rescue of pilots downed en route to and from raids on Truk. For the first three days she went about her duties unscathed in spite of Japanese air resistance.
At sunrise on 19 September 1944, however, a smoking Japanese fighter emerged from a heavy overcast and dove for "Mobjack". Unable to crash into the ship, the pilot dropped two bombs which exploded close alongside, holing the deck and wounding one of her crew.
Making temporary repairs, she remained at Morotai, tending PT boats of Task Unit 70.1.2 and PBYs now ranging over the Netherlands East Indies on relief and intelligence and reconnaissance missions, until February 1945.
The Philippines.
During February and March 1945, "Mobjack" transported materiel, spares, and advanced base personnel as she accompanied motor torpedo boat squadrons to forward areas. At Mios Woendi on 1 April 1945, she took on base force personnel of MTBRons 9 and 10 and on 2 April 1945 got underway for Samar in the Philippine Islands. Arriving on 11 April 1945, she disembarked her passengers and steamed on to Palawan, where she relieved motor torpedo boat tender USS "Willoughby" (AGP-9) as the repair unit for MTBRons 20 and 23. She moved on to Mangarin Bay, Mindoro, in mid‑May 1945 to overhaul and repair motor torpedo boats for use in the Philippines and in the upcoming Borneo operations.
The Borneo campaign.
On 8 June 1945, "Mobjack" steamed to Samar to stage for the landings at Balikpapan on Borneo. Departing on 21 June 1945, she moved, with MTBRons 10 and 27, to Basilan Island, thence, on 26 June 1945, further down the Sulu Archipelago and into Makassar Strait. On 27 June 1945, she joined the minesweepers, at work since 1 June 1945, and the ships of the bombardment group, which had been pounding the Japanese-held oil center since 17 June 1945, in preparing the way for the Australian assault force. For four days "Mobjack" fueled and sustained the motor torpedo boats assigned to night patrol off the coast to prevent the Japanese from replacing naval mines, restoring obstacles blown by underwater demolition teams, or disturbing channel markers planted by the minesweepers. On 1 July 1945, these extensive preparations and precautions proved to have been well executed as wave after wave of personnel of the Australian 7th Division of the Australian I Corps went ashore without a casualty.
"Mobjack", harassed by Japanese night air attacks until Royal Australian Air Force night fighters stopped them, remained outside the harbor for the next nine days. On 11 July 1945 she stood into the harbor, where, on 15 August 1945, she received a dispatch directing the cessation of all offensive action against the Japanese. World War II was over.
"Mobjack" received three battle stars for World War II service.
Post-World War II Navy career.
On 12 September 1945, "Mobjack" returned to the Philippines and for the next two months engaged in decommissioning motor torpedo boats under Commander, Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons, Philippine Sea Frontier. On 10 November 1945 she headed eastward, arriving at San Francisco, California, on 29 November 1945.
In December 1945, stripping of "Mobjack" began, and on 21 August 1946 she decommissioned. She was transferred the same day to the custody of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey career.
"Mobjack" joined the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey later in 1946 as the survey ship USC&GS "Pioneer" (OSS 31). "Pioneer" operated in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean and made important discoveries related to the theory of plate tectonics. She was sold for scrap on 4 May 1966 to National Metal and Steel Corporation, Terminal Island, California.

Contemporary Turkish literature

The time that can be called contemporary in Turkish literature falls in the period between the middle of the 20th century and the first years of the new millennium. Throughout this period many changes in literary discourse have occurred. Together with the fall of the Ottoman Empire and foundation of the Turkish Republic brought a different way to Turkish literature together with the effect of Westernization on Turkish writers. The literature of the new republic emerged largely from the pre-independence National Literature movement, with its roots simultaneously in the Turkish folk tradition and in the Western notion of progress. One important change to Turkish literature was enacted in 1928, when Mustafa Kemal initiated the creation and dissemination of a modified version of the Latin alphabet to replace the Arabic-based Ottoman script. Over time, this change—together with changes in Turkey's system of education— would lead to more widespread literacy in the country. In 1950s, Turkish authors started to write in the tone of their western contemporaries bringing a new sense of literature to the country.
All of the salient aspects of Turkish life, politics and culture have found their direct or indirect expression in poetry, fiction, and drama, as well as in critical and scholarly writing. The themes and concerns have included nationalism, social justice, search for modernity. Westernization, revival of folk culture, economic and technological progress, human dignity, mysticism, pluralistic society, human rights and fundamental freedoms, democratic ideals, Ataturkism, Turanism, Marxist-Lenist ideology, revival of Islam, humanism in fact all aspect and components of contemporary culture found a voice in literature. 
All stages of modern Turkish history (reforms under Atatürk, 1923–38; consolidation under Inonu, 1938–59; democracy under Menderes, 1950–60) have been marked by the thrust of literary modernization. Since the mid-nineteenth century, the most vital debate of Turkish literature has been between the proponents of art for art's sake and the advocates of commitment to realism and social causes. Mustafa Kemal in a conversation that took place in 1921, about two years before he proclaimed the Republic, exhorted the 19 years old Nazim Hikmet, already a famous poet, who would soon embrace the communist ideology and influence the course of modern Turkish literature, particularly poetry, more profoundly than anyone else. Since 1950, there has been a massive output, in all genres, depicting the plight of the lumpen proletariat. But surrealism, neosymbolism, theater of the absurd, stream of consciousness, hermeticism, black comedy and so on have also flourished.
History.
In 1923, when the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed, the influential social thinker Ziya Gökalp wrote: "We belong to Turkish nation, the Islamic community, and Western civilization... Our literature must go the people and, at the same time, towards the West." The literature of the Turkish Republic has achieved Gokalp's objective. 
Revolution, innovation, and Westernization have been driving forces of the Turkish nation in the twentieth century. The 19th century men of letters inherited the classical and the folk traditions but turned their attention to the literary tastes and movements of the West- particularly of France and England. The Ottoman state embarked upon process of transformation usually referred to as 'Westernization'.
Major authors.
Contemporary Turkish Literature consists of many prolific authors whose works both shaped and improved the overall picture of Turkish literature. Mehmet Akif Ersoy, a master of heroic diction, a major figure in early modern Turkish literature, devoted much of his verse to the dogma, and passion. His nationalism has a strong Islamic content, evident in the lyrics of the Turkish national anthem that he wrote. Yahya Kemal Beyatli was the much-acclaimed neoclassicist who produced, in the conventional forms and meters, meticulous lyrics of love, Ottoman grandeur, and Istanbul's natural attractions. Among the dedicated revolutionaries in 20th-century Turkish poetry Nazim Hikmet ranks the highest. He has been a modernizing force since the early 1920s, remaining significant in aesthetics and political terms. A communist, he spent many years in Turkish jails, fled to Soviet Union in 1951 and died in Moscow in 1963. Much of his works laments social injustice, complains of the oppression of the masses, and yearns for revolutionary change. In the mid-1950s a brave new genre emerged the 'Village novel' which reached its apogee with Yasar Kemal's "Ince Memed" (English title "Memed, My Hawk"; this novel has been translated into 25 languages). He was considered the most famous Turkish novelist not only in turkey but also in the world press and literary circles. Satirical fiction is dominated by Aziz Nesin, Turkey's best satirist ever. He is one of the most important figures of Turkish literature. He is the author of more than 100 books including poetry and prose.In more than 60 works, Nesin has provided strong indictment of the oppression and brutalization of the common man. A thrust for modernization took place in the early 1940s when Orhan Veli Kanik, Oktay Rifat, and Melih Cevdet Anday launched their poetic realism. Their urge for upheaval was revolutionary. A new generation had initiated obscurantism, continuing from where Asaf Haler Celebi's surrealism had left off in the 1940s. Ilhan Berk perhaps Turkey's most daring and durable poetic innovator, who acted as spokesman for the group (often identified as the Second New) pontificated "Art is for innovation's sake." The forms and values of classical poetry, too, are kept alive by a group of highly accomplished formalists who are clustered mainly around the monthly "Hisar" which ceased publishing at the end of 1980 after 30 years. His works have been translated into over thirty languages. Enis Batur is another important writer/poet in contemporary Turkish literature. He writes both in Turkish and in English. Some of his works are translated into English by Turkish translators. Orhan Pamuk is probably the best-known Turkish writer around the world mostly because of the Nobel Prize he won in 2006. He is considered one of the most prominent novelists of Turkey.

Reception.
Initial reception for the film was mixed. Press screenings shown in September 2009 produced mixed reviews.
"Edgy political thriller - A film unafraid to confront the decisions made by the powers that be."
"The over all acting is poor, the characters are two dimensional leaving you with no empathy for the key players and the story line is fragmented. One is left with the feeling that the budget should have been used on acting school for the players and training for the director rather than on helicopter and fancy car hire."
"This film is a testament to the spirit of the independent scene. - Stunning story told with courage and heart."

Michael Manzo

Michael L. "Mike" Manzo is a former chief of staff for Pennsylvania House of Representatives Majority Leader H. William DeWeese. He served as a staffer for the Democratic Caucus in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for over 10 years, rising to become one of the most powerful staffers in the state capitol. Manzo controlled the policy and communications efforts for the House Democratic Caucus and helped engineer the passage of a wide range of bills. 
In 2007, he was fired by DeWeese and subsequently charged for allegedly using taxpayer money for illegal campaign purposes and creating a no-work job for his mistress. In his testimony for the prosecution at a preliminary hearing, he implicated his former boss, DeWeese, in the alleged scheme.
Personal life.
Manzo was born in Monaca, Beaver County, Pennsylvania. His father was a steelworker and his mother worked at a local jewelry store. He played drums and baseball at Monaca School District, where he graduated fourth in his class. He graduated from Penn State University in 1991 with a degree in Marketing, and began working as a salesman for AT&T and as an agent for U.S. Airways.
Political career.
Pennsylvania House of Representatives.
With a recommendation from fellow Beaver County-native Mike Veon, Manzo began working in 1994 as a Harrisburg staff aide for long-time State Representative Camille "Bud" George. He worked at an "almost frantic pace" and rose through the ranks of the House Democratic Caucus of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. In 1999, he became press secretary and communications director for the House Democratic Caucus and spokesman for the Democratic leader, H. William DeWeese. In this position, he successfully re-designed and modernized the caucus' media strategy.
In 2001, Manzo became DeWeese's chief of staff and oversaw policy and communications for the entire Democratic caucus. In this position, he was a key negotiator for four state budgets, the historic slot machine gaming act, two expansions of the PACE/PACENET program, the Cover All Kids health insurance initiative, a minimum wage increase, the Growing Greener (I and II) initiatives, the 2004 economic stimulus package, and the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act. Manzo created an improved electronic and print communications between legislators and constituents by creating an caucus office for "e-communication," expanding the in-house print shop for legislative newsletters and reports, and developing podcasting and streaming audio and video. He was listed on the "Pennsylvania Report 100" most influential people in Pennsylvania for three straight years. His influence was noted by PoliticsPA.com, who name Manzo one of the "smartest staffers" in the Pennsylvania Capitol, describing him as having earned an "honorary Masters from the State Rep. Bud George school of politics." Pundits commented that his job description included providing frequent "DeWeese-to-English translations" for his boss' famously verbose speaking style. In 2002, he was named to the PoliticsPA list of "Rising Stars" in Pennsylvania politics.
Firing.
Manzo and six other Democratic staffers were fired on November 13, 2007, after the release of emails pertaining to the Pennsylvania Attorney General's investigation into illegal legislative bonuses paid for campaign work. Manzo denied any wrongdoing and said that he resigned to avoid becoming a distraction for the Democratic caucus.
Triad Strategies.
By the end of November 2007, Manzo was hired as a senior relations consultant for Triad Strategies, a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania-based lobbying and public relations firm. Anthony May, a senior vice president at Triad, expressed no concern about hiring Manzo in the midst of the legislative bonus controversy, saying, "We always had hoped Mike would come to work for us."
Legal issues.
Grand jury investigation.
On July 10, 2008, Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett announced that his office was filing charges against Manzo and 11 other current and former Democratic staff members relating to the legislative bonus controversy. Manzo faces nine counts each of conflict of interest, theft by unlawful taking or disposition, theft by deception, theft of services, theft by failure to make required disposition of funds, and two counts of criminal conspiracy. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 311 years in prison and $660,000 in fines.
The grand jury convened to investigate the matter found that Manzo had "directly coordinated" the illegal use of taxpayer funds and resources for political campaigns. Specifically, the grand jury found that in 2004, Manzo and Mike Veon began tracking all House Democratic Caucus employees who volunteered for off-duty political campaign work. This list recorded the various efforts and campaign activities of the "volunteers" and was eventually refined to identify those public employees who excelled at these campaign efforts, denoting them as "superstars," "Rock Stars," "Good," and "OK." The House Democratic Caucus paid $188,800 in taxpayer funds as secret bonuses to these staffers a reward for their campaign efforts for the 2004 election. The secret bonuses paid in 2006 election totaled $1,285,250.
The grand jury also found that Manzo and fellow staffer Brett Cott used the employees and resources of the House Democratic Caucus to mount petition challenges against opponents of the House Democratic Caucus and the Democratic Party. Employees of the caucus spent time during their regular work hours working to disqualify candidates, including Presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2004 and the Green Party's candidate for the US Senate in 2006, Carl Romanelli. Additionally, the grand jury found that Manzo had used his authority to create a "no-work" job for a former legislative intern with whom he allegedly had a "long-running sexual liaison" from 2004 through November 2007. The office was located above Bloom Cigar Company, an iconic cigar store in Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood owned by a friend of Mike Veon.
Testimony in preliminary hearing.
Manzo waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the sufficiency of the evidence against him. In a surprise turn, he took the stand as a witness for the prosecution during preliminary hearings for two of his co-defendants, State Representative Sean Ramaley and Anna Marie Perretta-Rosepink, and implicated DeWeese in the bonus scheme. According to his testimony under cross-examination, Manzo believed that DeWeese was aware that the secret bonuses were compensation for illegal campaign work. DeWeese, who has not been charged with any crime, denies any wrongdoing and called Manzo a "desperate, disgruntled former employee whom I fired last year for dishonesty and self-dealing." Manzo's attorney, Jim Eisenhower, who ran for Pennsylvania Attorney General in 2000 and was the Democratic nominee for Attorney General in 2004, said that Manzo will plead guilty to the "most serious charges against him" and will make his cooperation known to the sentencing judge. The trial of the 12 defendants is expected to begin in January 2009.

Douglas P.

Douglas P. (born Douglas Pearce, 27 April 1956), is an English folk musician, record label owner, photographer and actor who records under the name Death in June. He was born in Sheerwater in Woking, Surrey, and resides in Australia.
Early life.
Pearce was born on 27 April 1956, and grew up in Sheerwater, a suburb of London which he described as a "white, working-class ghetto", to a father who worked as a courier for the military, and had served in World War II. Both of his parents were English, though his mother claimed Scots-Irish ancestry.
His father died of a heart attack at age 56, when Pearce was 14. Pearce grew up in what he describes as "a very militaristic environment, surrounded by war", and says that he "had a natural attraction to war". At the age of 18 Pearce left home and hitchhiked around Europe and "came home a changed man".
As a child, Pearce was exorcised by his parents for alleged demonic possession, and after his father died, his mother and he would "muck around with a Ouija board". Pearce still firmly believes in the paranormal and occult, and claims to have had contact with various entities.
Douglas P. is openly gay, and says that 'being gay is fundamental to Death in June', and expresses discontent with this side of Death in June not being explored in interviews. He describes the lack of coverage of this as 'incredulous' ["sic"]. His literary influences include Yukio Mishima and Jean Genet, whom he admires 'not only because their work was brilliant but that they were also gay. It adds so much.'
Musical work.
Crisis.
Pearce began his musical career in a British punk band called Crisis in 1977. After Crisis disbanded in 1980, Pearce formed Death in June with Crisis bandmate Tony Wakeford (currently of the English folk noir band, Sol Invictus) and Patrick O'Kill né Leagas (currently a member of the English band Mother Destruction).
Death in June.
In 1985 Douglas P. became the sole constant member of Death in June, with rotating guest musicians serving as collaborators and live band members. Pearce continues working under the Death in June moniker to this day.
NER.
Pearce has released numerous recordings of musical work of his own and others under his "New European Recordings" label since 1981.
Neofolk.
Pearce was highly influential in the creation of a musical movement often referred to as neofolk, often collaborating and playing live with various artists within the genre.

Captain Moses W. Collyer House

The Captain Moses W. Collyer House, also Driftwood, is located on River Road South in Chelsea, New York, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.
It was the home of Collyer, a riverboat captain on the nearby Hudson, from 1899 until his death on September 22, 1942 as noted by New York Times. A few years after moving in, he cowrote "The Sloops of the Hudson", a memoir and history of the years when sailboats were the primary means of getting up and down the river. An exhaustive and complete work that drew on Collyer's background in a riverfaring family, it is today considered the definitive history of that era and its boats.
The house itself, built just before the turn of the 20th century, is an eclectic mixture of Late Victorian styles reflecting Collyer's experience traveling the river and its port communities. It is still a private residence, and not open to the public.
Property.
The house overlooks the Hudson River across River Road and the railroad tracks today used by Metro-North's Hudson Line. It is a two-story frame home on a brick foundation topped by a gambrel roof. On the south side, in the brick, is a datestone reading "M.W. COLLYER/1899". The west (front) facade has four bays on the first floor behind a wraparound veranda and three on the second. Projecting bays at the rear of either side have smaller gambrel roofs.
It is sided in clapboard to the roofline, then in shingles within the gambrels, except in the rear where the clapboard continues to the top. All the gambrels contain one window, with the west facade's Palladian-style one being the most elaborate.
The porch columns are the original woodwork, tapered and turned; a simple balustrade connects them. Much of the interior is also original, including the oak staircase in the entrance hall and a marbleized mantelpiece in the parlor. The upper floor and attic are finished, and were used as bedrooms and servants' quarters originally.
There are several outbuildings, all considered contributing resources to the historic character of the property. A large clapboard garden shed with frontal cross-gable was built along with the house and follows its general design and decoration, as does a nearby wooden privy. The garage was built around 1932 by Collyer as a wedding present to his daughter, and has a wooden plaque noting this event.
History.
Collyer was born around 1850 in Red Hook, further upriver in Dutchess County. His father, John L. Collyer, had started out on the river from his native Ossining (then known as Sing Sing) in the 1830s. Soon John Collyer became captain and owner of a North River packet sloop that sailed from upper Red Hook Landing, now known as Tivoli, to New York City in the 1830s, and continued sailing commercially in some capacity until his death in 1889. Collyer's uncles went into the shipbuilding business and also grew wealthy.
John Collyer sailed the sloop "Benjamin Franklin" out of Poughkeepsie in 1865. Moses joined the sloop that year as a cabin boy. The "Benjamin Franklin" carried crockery and earthenware from Foster's Dock at Poughkeepsie in the spring and fall to ports along the Hudson. Moses continued to work in the family business until leaving for the schooner "Iron Age" in 1877; the following year he became the captain and owner of the "Henry B. Fidderman", another schooner. Two years later he switched to steamers as captain of the "Henrietta Collyer", built in Nyack for the river's iron and limestone trade.
Captain Collyer also acquired the sloop "Mohican", built in 1837 at Peekskill, and had her sunk in front of his house to serve as a breakwater and dock. The "spine" of the "Mohican" can be sometimes be seen south of the Chelsea Yacht Club, especially at low water.
Members of the Collyer family, including Moses, had lived in Chelsea since 1868, although it is not known where. In 1899, nearing retirement as the New York Central Railroad's lines up the river had supplanted navigation in the Hudson Valley, Collyer built the house. Detailed records kept during its construction, including photos at different stages of the process and receipts for construction materials, survive to this day and are a useful record of turn-of-the-century building practices.
A few years later, Collyer and William Verplanck, the scion of a wealthy family in the area and a boat owner himself, collaborated on "The Sloops of the Hudson", a history of the sail era on the river. Collyer's detailed recollections of the ships and people he had known over the years made the book's second half, which he wrote, the essential resource on the subject as there is no other record so comprehensive.
Other than the construction of the garage, there have been few other alterations to the house. The porch steps have been rebuilt and a handrail added. The porch itself has been enclosed.
Aesthetics.
The house represents a mix of styles, waxing and waning, in a fashion popular during the last years of the 19th century. The irregular, yet compact, massing of the main forms and mixture of materials are characteristic of the Queen Anne style, then reaching its final stages. In contrast, the gambrel roof and Palladian window show the emergence of the Colonial Revival, a style that would become widespread in the first decades of the new century. Its overall generic style demonstrates architectural trends moving out of their original contexts and the integration of Chelsea with the larger economy.
Inside, the house reflects changing tastes as well. The interior's rooms are less grand than most earlier Victorian homes, suggesting a space meant for living as opposed to entertaining, and the more open placement of the kitchen and other backrooms suggest a more egalitarian attitude than a strictly Victorian home would. The contrast between the values of the Queen Anne style and the Colonial Revival is also represented by the marbleized mantelpiece and unpainted oak stair respectively.

Death in June

Death in June are a neofolk group led by English folk musician Douglas Pearce, better known as Douglas P. The band was originally formed in Britain in 1981 as a trio, but after the other members left in 1984 and 1985 to work on other projects, the group became the work of Douglas P. and various collaborators. Douglas P. now lives in Australia.
Over the band's three decades of existence, they have made numerous shifts in style and presentation, resulting in an overall shift from initial post-punk and Industrial Records influence to a more acoustic and folk music-oriented approach. They are sometimes considered controversial (largely due to usage of themes and imagery relating to Nazi Germany). Douglas P.'s influence was instrumental in sparking neofolk, of which his music has subsequently become a part.
Origin.
Pearce formed Death in June in 1981 in England, along with Patrick Leagas and Tony Wakeford. Pearce and Wakeford had been members of the political punk band Crisis, which formed in 1977. Crisis had gained a substantial following in the UK punk subculture. Crisis performed at rallies for The Right to Work, Rock Against Racism, and the Anti-Nazi League.
Early Death in June (1981–1985).
Death in June soon left the reticent punk scene behind and began to infuse their sound with electronics and martial style drumming, combined with a Joy Division-influenced post-punk sound. Their lyrics maintained much of the poetry and political urgency of the early Crisis recordings. Tracks such as the early single sides "Holy Water" and "State Laughter" demonstrated an ongoing fascination with political systems. Further on, Douglas P. would abandon any overt interest in politics in favor of a more esoteric approach to his work.
Live debut.
The band played their first show on 20 November 1981 in London, at the City of London Polytechnic now London Guildhall University, England, supporting The Birthday Party followed by a short British tour in 1982 (the 28 May show was released unofficially by Patrick Leagas later in 1987 as "Oh How We Laughed") and a more extensive tour in 1983.
Introduction of folk music.
For 1983's "The Guilty Have No Pride" LP, Death in June began to adopt a more traditional European folk sound, using more acoustic guitars, references to ancient and contemporary European history, and combining heavy percussion with electronic soundscapes and post-industrial experimentation.
Tony Wakeford departs.
After some tension in the group regarding the direction it was taking, Wakeford was asked to leave Death in June in January 1984 after a show in Paris, France. Wakeford then began a post-punk project called Above the Ruins shortly before founding Sol Invictus. Although relations were bad for several years after his enforced departure, Wakeford re-established his friendship with Douglas P. in the late 1980s. He remains on good terms with Douglas P. and has appeared as a guest on stage during one Death in June show in London in 1998.
"Nada!" flirtation with dance music.
The "Nada!" (1985) LP introduced a temporary dance sound to Death in June accompanied by other tracks with the previously introduced folk elements. Douglas P. would later state this period was brought about by Patrick Leagas, which is further justified by Leagas' other work as Sixth Comm and later by his joining Mother Destruction, where he would further explore themes of Germanic paganism and historically-inspired music.
Patrick Leagas departs.
Patrick Leagas abruptly left the group in April 1985 after a tour of Italy, resulting in many cancelled shows in the UK and Europe due to follow that tour. Leagas, who began calling himself Patrick O-Kill, later formed Sixth Comm. From that point until the present, Death in June has consisted solely of the work of Douglas P. and various collaborators.

In 1991, Douglas P. named and helped form World Serpent Distribution; a British distribution company that specialized in esoteric, experimental and post-industrial music, which would distribute his NER releases until the late 1990s. During this period, Pearce collaborated with many artists who also had material distributed through the company in various ways.
Collaboration with David Tibet.
David Tibet formed Current 93 in 1982. After being introduced to Douglas P. by Alan McGee of Creation Records at the Living Room Club, London in 1983, Tibet eventually began working with Death in June. Upon meeting Tibet, Douglas P. began to devote more of his time to a new circle of collaborators, who introduced him to various Thelemic, Satanic and Hermetic disciplines that markedly affected his approach to composing music. Familiar with the Runic alphabet, Douglas P. introduced them to Tibet. Tibet similarly had been long interested in magic and religion and implemented these concepts in his early recordings with Current 93.
Douglas P. introduced a folk influence to Current 93/David Tibet, who in turn contributed to Death in June's "Nada!" (1985) LP and its remix version titled "93 Dead Sunwheels" (1989), as well as the albums "The World That Summer", "Brown Book", and "The Wall of Sacrifice". He continued his work with Death in June, ending their collaborations with a contribution to the (1995) LP, "Rose Clouds of Holocaust" before their eventual split.
Douglas P. also contributed to Current 93 projects, including the definitive Apocalyptic folk LPs "Swastikas for Noddy", "Earth Covers Earth", "1888", and "Thunder Perfect Mind" as well as playing live on many occasions from 1986-93 with Tibet's group. Douglas P. has stated that after he stopped contributing to Current 93, Tibet replaced his acoustic guitar works with that of Michael Cashmore, whom Douglas P. had tutored in the songs he had written for Current 93.
Collaboration with Boyd Rice begins.
Boyd Rice of NON met Douglas P. on tour in Japan during this period. He was invited to assist on the "Wall of Sacrifice" LP, where he contributed a spoken word piece. This was to mark a long period of collaborations with Boyd Rice from the early 1990s until 2004, leading to side projects such as Scorpion Wind and albums bearing both the Boyd Rice and Death in June names.
Collaboration with LJDLP.
Les Joyaux De La Princesse collaborated with Douglas P. on the "" double cassette release. Douglas P. sent LJDLP source material, which LJDLP would remix and send back after making any musical or aesthetic changes.
Collaboration with John Murphy begins.
Douglas P. having recently moved to Australia, came back into contact with John Murphy of Knifeladder and previously of SPK. Murphy began playing live percussion with Death in June during tours from 1996 onwards. From 2000 a period of very stripped down, largely acoustic live performances for Death in June began up until Douglas P. announced no further live shows in 2005. In September 2011 a European tour was announced commemorating the 30th anniversary of the group's foundation in 1981. However the tour started off in Sydney, Australia without the actual inclusion of John Murphy.
Contemporary Death in June (1996–present).
Collaboration with Albin Julius Martinek.
After queuing to meet his idol Douglas P. backstage at a performance in Munich in December 1996, Albin Julius Martinek of Der Blutharsch later collaborated and toured throughout Europe between 1998-2000 with Death in June. Together, they produced the albums "Take Care & Control" and "Operation Hummingbird", as well as the live album "Heilige!". In comparison to previous Death In June works these were remarkably extroverted yet plagaristic, courtesy of Martinek's contributions, sampling musical motifs from the likes of Richard Wagner, Franz Schubert, French 1960s pop icon Serge Gainsbourg amongst others. This resulted in a bombastic, neoclassical, post-industrial and extremely martial sound with few traces of the previous folk elements. The music created during this period could be classified as a part of the martial music genre which Pearce had initiated in 1986 on "The World That Summer" album with tracks like 'Death Of A Man' and again in 1989 on "The Wall Of Sacrifice" album with the title track and 'Death Is A Drummer'. Pearce wrote a song loosely inspired by an untitled Der Blutharsch song for the "Fire Danger Season" Der Blutharsch tribute compilation. The track title was later created/revealed as "Many Enemies Bring Much Honour", which also appears on the rework and rarities album entitled 'Abandon Tracks!'
Demise of World Serpent Distribution.
The late 1990s marked the beginning of a court case between Death in June and World Serpent Distribution regarding payment and distribution issues with several other artists that were then on the label. This led to many artists that had sided with or had a similar experience to Pearce's leaving the distribution company and largely moving to Tesco Distribution Germany, as well as other then well established labels such as Eis & Licht. Eventually, Pearce was issued an out of court settlement for the case, leading to the demise of World Serpent Distribution. This led to reissues of most of the major albums in the Death in June discography being made freely available, with overhauled, deluxe packaging and a considerably cheaper price.
Collaboration with Andreas Ritter.
On the "All Pigs Must Die" LP, Pearce was assisted by Andreas Ritter of the neofolk group Forseti who played accordion on a few tracks on the first half of the LP. This marked a return to the previous folk sound of Death in June. Death in June have also appeared live with Forseti and Pearce appeared on Forseti's "Windzeit" LP.
After Andreas Ritter suffered a stroke and subsequent loss of memory and ability to play musical instruments, Pearce contributed acoustic versions of Death in June songs to a tribute album to Ritter entitled "Forseti Lebt" released in August 2006.
Collaboration with Boyd Rice ends.
After completing the "Alarm Agents" LP, Pearce announced it would be his final collaboration with Rice, citing the decision as having been mutually decided during the recording of "Alarm Agents" in a studio situated in a valley in Wellington, New Zealand as helicopters flew beneath the two of them. Pearce recalls:
"We turned toward each other and said, 'This is going to be the last collaboration. It can't get better than this.'"
In 2013, in order to dismiss all speculation and questions about future collaborations between Pearce and Rice, Rice announced via Facebook that he had severed personal and business relationships with Pearce.
Etymology.
Much has been made of the origins of the name "Death in June". It is sometimes considered to be an allusion to the Night of the Long Knives Sturmabteilung purge on 30 June 1934, or alternately to the 1914 assassination in Sarajevo that helped spark World War I. However, "Death in June" is actually a mondegreen, Pearce has said that he once misheard Patrick Leagas during a rehearsal and he "heard" it as "Death in June" and settled upon this chance mishearing. The group then subsequently applied it to the project in 1981. Pearce has stated that the name does not express any single idea for him and remains multifaceted.
Neofolk music.
Pearce's influence was also instrumental in creating a genre of music called neofolk throughout Europe. Pearce often plays live with artists that are considered a part of this genre and guests on their records.
Influences.
Film and certain television programs have been a major influence on Death in June, sometimes being worked into compositions or referenced directly in album titles. Influential films and television shows include "The World That Summer", "Take a Closer Look", "The Night Porter", "The Prisoner", "Night and Fog", and "Come and See".
Pearce has cited Friedrich Nietzsche, the Norse "Eddas", Yukio Mishima, Saxon poetry, and Jean Genet as strong influences upon his work. Although some of these influences have waned as the discography has increased, Genet and Mishima were quoted in the booklet of the rare track retrospective "Abandon Tracks" (2001).
Pearce has stated that Nico, Scott Walker, Ennio Morricone, Industrial Records-era Industrial music, "Forever Changes"-era Love and traditional European folk music have all had a considerable impact upon his musical output.
Symbolism and aesthetics.
Death in June has always used symbolism, in lyrics and aesthetic approaches. Often these symbols are slightly modified European historical or ancestral symbols or point to general areas of time, with a small 6 applied.
Masks.
According to Pearce, since its inception Death in June:"did not want to become a part of a normal rock 'n' roll thing. Pretty boys staring into the cameras with huge cocks and IQs of one million... It doesn't work like that."
Since the early days of Death in June, the band would appear on stage wearing various masks and uniforms pertaining to the subject matters presented. The band shunned group photos, with very few ever taken, usually featuring the band masked or with their back to the camera.
In 1992, during a trip to Italy, Pearce encountered a unique mask at a carnival shop. Fans were so taken by the mask, it became iconic for Death in June. Pearce often wears the mask when playing live and it appears on various Death in June releases, most visibly on the live "Something Is Coming" double LP.
Camouflage.
Specific varieties of camouflage are regularly worn by Pearce and appear on various Death in June releases. Most commonly, the variety of camouflage used is the German World War II Waffen SS autumnal Erbsenmuster/"pea pattern" (usually on original items) though sometimes the modern Bundeswehr Flecktarn or possibly the post-World War II Austrian fleckerlteppich pattern is used.
The subject of camouflage has also appeared in the lyrics of Death in June, notably in the song "Hidden Among the Leaves", a reference to the Japanese Hagakure.
Totenkopf-6.
A slightly grinning skull, framed by a circle and a small 6 in the lower right corner. Death in June has, since at least the "State Laughter / Holy Water" 7″, used variations of the Prussian Totenkopf or "Death's Head" symbol. Pearce has stated repeatedly that the symbol is not an endorsement of extermination camp atrocities and the symbol far predates the Third Reich, having been used by the Prussian army under Frederick the Great. Although the particular version used by Death in June is a modified, faintly grinning version of the SS insignia, Pearce has stated the symbolism is clear: "The Totenkopf for Death, and the six for the sixth month - June." 
Whip-Hand.
A studded, gloved hand holding a whip surrounded by a circle and a small 6 in the lower right corner. This symbol has been used by Death in June since at least the "She Said Destroy" 7″/12″, stated by Pearce to signify control and relates to "having the whip hand", a British expression. The hand is gloved, giving it both a medieval and fetishistic element, and is often used either in place of the Totenkopf or with it. This symbol was used later than the Totenkopf and is usually secondary to it. As with the Totenkopf-6, the 6 presumably refers to June.
Three Bars.
Three parallel, up-standing vertical bars accompanied by a small six in the lower right corner. Although a very basic symbol, this symbol likely originates, for the use of Death in June, from the 1943 Kursk version of the insignia of the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf. This symbol was used as vehicle markings on the vehicles of that unit. It may have been used to signify the three members of Death in June at the time. Scantly used afterwards for the purpose of Death in June, it first appeared on the "" LP and is rarely used when not referring directly to this period of Death in June.
Runes.
Germanic paganism has been more and more a common theme for Death in June with each successive release. Runic text has appeared on many Death in June albums, as well as references to runes in the lyrics of the songs themselves.
In a 2005 interview, Pearce states:"I'm very happy about that because I see Death in June as part of a European cultural revival. I'm pleased that the Old Gods are being resurrected, for want of a better word. Old symbols. I feel very pleased that I am a part of that process and that I have had influence. At this stage in the game, so to speak, it's not false modesty to say that I am content with my influence."
There is a combination of runes that is etched on to the "To Drown a Rose" 10″ and the original cover for "Rose Clouds of Holocaust" LP. Pearce has also this bind rune as something of a signature.
According to Pearce:"In 1986 whilst staying with Tibet in his flat in Freya Aswynn's house in north London over a period of 3 nights I dreamed I was falling in a sort of rain of indistinct runes. On each separate night I managed to concentrate enough on one particular rune to stop it from spinning and moving so I could actually see which one it was. When I awoke I made a note of it. After 3 nights the dream stopped and I decided to try and form an 'appropriate' bind rune from the original 3. This I did and after Freya saw it I basically was given a 'thumbs up' about the whole thing. It definitely does not refer to my name but it definitely does refer to ME."
The Odal rune has sometimes been used by Pearce. This can be seen very visibly on the "Come Before Christ and Murder Love" 7″ cover. The algiz rune has often been used by Pearce for non-album Death in June purposes, appearing sometimes with a circle around it as seen on "The World That Summer" 2×LP, on the official website and elsewhere.
Controversy.
Detractors have accused Death in June of harboring neo-Nazi sympathies. Pearce has said, "At the start of the eighties, Tony and I were involved in radical left politics and beneath it history students. In search of a political view for the future we came across National Bolshevism which is closely connected with the "Sturmabteilung" hierarchy. People like Gregor Strasser and Ernst Röhm who were later known as 'second revolutionaries' attracted our attention." The "Sturmabteilung" (Stormtroopers) were a paramilitary unit of the Nazi Party (NSDAP), and Strasser and Röhm were Nazi leaders who vied for Adolf Hitler's power.
Protests have been staged and some performances have been cancelled due to these accusations. Justification for the cancellations stem from strong aversions to the Nazi inspired symbolism of Death in June coupled with an interpretation of select lyrics as containing deliberate Third Reich-era imagery and tropes. When questioned about his interest in the Third Reich, Pearce responded, "I've an interest in all aspects of the Third Reich. It has had such a huge influence on the world, who could fail to be intrigued by it? However, I've still read more pages of "Das Kapital" than "Mein Kampf"!"
Pearce, who is openly homosexual, has collaborated with various ethnic Jews throughout his music career. The official Death in June website site featured the flag of Israel, and Death in June played a concert in Israel on June 18, 2004 for a predominantly Jewish audience.
Banned in Lausanne, Switzerland.
On 19 November 1998, Death in June was scheduled to play with Boyd Rice, Fire + Ice, and Der Blutharsch in Lausanne, Switzerland. A day prior the scheduled show, Pearce appeared wearing a sign, restrained by two men (Boyd Rice and Albin Julius) in ape suits wearing Third Reich-era swastika arm bands. He gave a press conference announcing that he had been banned for the first time from playing live. After pressure from a local activist group, the decision was made by the local chief of police Bernard Metraux, due to perceived ambiguity, to not allow Pearce to appear on stage. However, Rice, Fire + Ice and Der Blutharsch were allowed to take the stage.
A petition for the resignation of Metraux circulated amongst concertgoers at the show and eventually equaled 184 signatures. At the concert, a man appearing to be Pearce took the stage and revealed himself to be Rice. Rice performed an altered rendition of Death in June's "C'est un rêve" to commemorate the event. This rendition of the song was later credited to "NON & Freunde", and was released on the "Der tod im juni" compilation. After the concert, a website was created by Swiss fans featuring photographs recording the event. Pearce later recorded a song about the situation on "Operation Hummingbird" in 1998.
In a 2005 interview with Pearce, he recalls the event:"This has to do with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If at the end of the day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours."
"When I had a meeting with the Council a day before the concert, they were absolutely petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.'"
"Of course, there were no Nazi, skinhead hordes and I didn't play and they got elected. So, life goes on. The fishwives got their way."
Cancelled performance in Chicago, Illinois.
The concert was scheduled to take place at a venue called The Empty Bottle on 13 December 2003, with Der Blutharsch and Changes. Initially, pressure from a group calling themselves the Center for New Community was applied to the owner of the club, Bruce Finkelman. Finkelman, who is Jewish, and his staff, which contains African Americans, initially decided the show would go on, feeling there was insufficient evidence to cancel the performance.
Debate continued on The Empty Bottle's website, fueled partially by an email and ten-day telephone campaign waged by the Center for New Community to ban the event. Finkelman offered a compromise: He invited the CNC to distribute anti-racist information within the venue, as well as any other group that wished to do so, and offered to give the venue's proceeds of the concert to the Anti-Defamation League. The CNC refused.
Finkelman, feeling the pressure, started to relent and decided to remove Changes from the bill. As the controversy mounted from complaints regarding the band due to the Center for New Community's campaign, he eventually cancelled the night altogether. Due to the mounting pressure and threats of violence by other groups, Finkelman expressed regret for this decision, describing the censorship as a "black mark on the arts community" and continued to encourage open discussion instead of censorship.
The venue was moved to Deja Vu, another venue in Chicago that Saturday. Members of Anti-Racist Action began to gather at the venue. The concert was cancelled by the venue owners just before it was scheduled to begin, due to violence between Anti-Racist Action and fans of Death in June.
Federal restrictions in Germany.
On 21 December 2005, the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons banned all sales and distribution of "Rose Clouds of Holocaust" to minors, which had been available to everyone in the country since 1995. Early in 2006, discussion on the Death in June Yahoo list resulted in a response from Pearce, who revealed that he had been asked several months earlier by his distributor, Tesco Organisation Germany (based in Mannheim), to explain passages of his work to the German government. Pearce provided his original response to the government, which featured, for the first time, Pearce's explanation for numerous aspects of Death in June, including lyrics, song titles, events and use of aesthetics as well as dates, people and locations. Pearce issued a second letter stating that Tesco Organisation Germany had filed an appeal against the ban. At the request of Douglas P., who viewed it as a demeaning waste of time and money, the appeal was abandoned in November 2007.
A third email was sent regarding the ban, in which Pearce expressed concern for further arbitrary action by the German authorities in banning further albums and artists within the "Neo-Folk/Post Industrial/whatever you wish to label it scene." Pearce requested the organisation of a "Fighting Fund Festival" to help raise funds for legal support.
Meanwhile "Brown Book" has been banned as well, and selling it is totally illegal in Germany because it contains elements of the song "Horst-Wessel-Lied", which was the official anthem of the Brown shirted S.A.(Sturmabteilung). This happened according to Strafgesetzbuch section 86a, which outlaws "use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations".

The Brinkerhoff

The Brinkerhoff is a vacation lodge in Grand Teton National Park on the shore of Jackson Lake. It is the last remaining example of a forest lease vacation lodge in the park. The log house and caretaker's lodge were designed by architect Jan Wilking of Casper, Wyoming and were built in 1946 in what was then U.S. Forest Service land for the Brinkerhoff family. After the creation of Grand Teton National Park, the National Park Service acquired the property and used it for VIP housing. Among the guests at the Brinkerhof were John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. The lodge is also notable as a post-war adaptation of the rustic style of architecture. The interior is an intact example of this transitional style.
History.
In the early days of Grand Teton National Park there were 111 forest leases, a legacy of U.S. Forest Service administration of lands that were incorporated into the new park. Ben Sheffield received a Forest Service lease for a parcel on Jackson Lake in 1930. The Sheffield house burned in the 1940s and the lease was purchased by Zachery K. Brinkerhoff Sr. and his son in 1947 from R.E. McConaughy. The Brinkerhoffs were the owners of an oil development company, the Brinkerhoff Drilling company. They hired Wiling to design their retreat, which was built by Scotty Sloten and four carpenters of Swedish descent from the Wind River valley, experienced in log construction. The house was furnished with furniture and accessories made by Western-style designer Thomas C. Molesworth. The house was sold to the Park Service in 1955. It received significant publicity as a result of the presidential visits.
Description.
The Brinkerhoff is an early example of the conscious adaptation of rustic-style architecture that had been employed in public buildings around Jackson Hole to a private vacation house, in which the rustic style sets the tone of a rustic retreat. Jan Wilking's interpretation of the rustic style represents a transition from the heavy, consciously rustic style seen in public park buildings, to a cleaned-up, more finished and polished style., which would be further developed in vacation homes throughout the West. The main house is a partial two story log building of dressed log construction, with vertical wood sheathing on the upper story. The front gable is sheathed in planks arranged in a V-pattern. A deck spans the full width of the west side of the house, overlooking Mount Moran and Jackson Lake, an early occurrence of a feature that has since become ubiquitous. The interior features a two story living room. Interiors are finished with knotty pine paneling and polished wood floors. A smaller caretaker's cottage mirrors the style of the main house.
The Brinkerhoff was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1990.

USS Wachusetts (SP-548)

USS "Wachusetts" (SP-548) was an armed motorboat that served in the United States Navy as a patrol vessel from 1917 to 1919. She was renamed USS "SP-548" during her period of service.
"Wachusetts" was built as the private motorboat "W.C.T.U." in 1916 by W. A. and S. D. Moss of Friendship, Maine. She had been renamed "Wachusetts" by the time she was acquired by the U.S. Navy in the spring of 1917 from the Howard Lumber Company of Boston, Massachusetts, for World War I service. The Navy took possession of her on 26 April 1917 and designated her SP-548.
Little is known of her activities because her deck logs have been lost. As of 1 February 1918, "Wachusetts" was operating out of the section base at Boothbay, Maine, probably on local patrol duties, under the aegis of Commandant, 1st Naval District. Her commanding officer as of that time was Ensign J. B. Eckroll, USNRF.
The name "Wachusetts" apparently was dropped somewhat later to avoid confusion with USS "Wachusett" (ID-1840) -- a cargo ship that commissioned in January 1918 and served until October 1919—and the boat became simply USS "SP-548".
Confusion exists as to her ultimate fate. She was struck from the Navy List on 25 October 1919 and reportedly transferred to the Bureau of Fisheries simultaneously. However, subsequent lists of vessels operated by the Bureau of Fisheries fail to account for her.

Glenn Hubbard Hearn (April 17, 1914 – January 7, 1978) served as mayor of Huntsville, Alabama, from 1964 to 1968. He also served as a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1941 until becoming mayor, and as the senior agent in charge of the North Alabama division since 1944.
During Hearn's term as mayor, the City of Huntsville grew in land area by approximately 40% to 106.803 square miles. However, during his term, Hearn seemed more interested in public relations than the administrative aspects of his office.
After declining to seek re-election following his first term, his administrative assistant Joe Davis successfully ran for mayor. Hearn served in the state legislature from 1970 to 1974. In 1972, he ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Huntsville against Davis, garnering only slightly more than a third of the vote.
After leaving the legislature, Hearn became Madison County Personnel Director until his apparent suicide by asphyxiation in 1978.

Welcome Aboard Toxic Airlines

Welcome Aboard Toxic Airlines is a 2007 British agenda-documentary film directed and produced by former airline captain Tristan Loraine on the subject of so-called aerotoxic syndrome.
Plot.
This agenda-documentary shows that for nearly fifty years, airline passengers and crews have been supplied with unfiltered bleed air, taken directly from the engines, and shares how certain political advocacy groups have alleged that this air supply sometimes becomes contaminated with neurotoxins, carcinogens and other hazardous chemicals, and sometimes referred to as a fume event.
GCAQE and Tristan Loraine.
Former British Airways Captain Tristan Loraine, the producer of the film, is co-chair of the GCAQE group. 
Contrary opinions.
Ongoing research by the UK government has not found a link to long term health problems. The UK Parliament Select Committee on Science and Technology concludes that the concerns about significant risk to the health of airline passengers and crew are not substantiated.
According to Professor Bagshaw, the former Head Doctor at British Airways,and now an advisor to Airbus, there have been no peer-reviewed recorded cases of neurological harm in humans following low-level exposure to the organophosphate tricresyl phosphate (TCP), which is used as a lubricant in jet engines.

The Energy Construct

The Energy Construct is a 2007 non-fiction book by author Ben Cipiti that examines the challenge of achieving a clean, independent, and economical energy future for the United States. The book examines alternative transportation fuels, renewable energy, nuclear energy, and clean fossil energy to develop a path forward.
Book summary.
The continued reliance on fossil fuels in the United States is having drastic consequences to the environment, and continued reliance on foreign oil threatens national security and economic well-being. Alternative energy technologies have a number of strengths and weaknesses. This book examines the various technologies from the standpoints of economics, environmental impact, domestic resource potential, public acceptability, and reliability to find a path forward.
The transportation alternatives to oil that are examined in the book include biofuels, hydrogen, and electric vehicles. The author concludes that only electric vehicles will achieve drastically reduced emissions in an efficient manner, and plug-in hybrids will be the first step that will lead to economical competitiveness.
Increased reliance on electricity will make it that much more important to develop clean power plants. Renewable energy will be part of the solution, but high costs are poor reliability continue to make renewable sources challenging to develop cost-effectively. The author concludes that wind energy has the greatest potential for near-term expansion. However, smaller-scale use of solar, geothermal, biomass, and ocean sources along with current hydroelectric sources could add up to make a significant contribution. The advantages and disadvantages of each renewable energy option are examined.
Nuclear energy is also supported by the author as the only way to produce large amounts of emission-free power. The author pays close attention to the safety of nuclear energy and provides a unique comparison of the safety of energy generation from a number of sources.
Fossil energy is then examined with a focus on the development of carbon sequestration technologies. Coal power plants will full carbon sequestration are shown to be competitive with existing natural gas plants due to the currently high natural gas prices.

Vladimir Zenzinov

Vladimir Mikhailovich Zenzinov (; historically, his surname was also transcribed as Sensinoff: 29 November 1880 - 20 October 1953) was a member of Russia's Socialist-Revolutionary Party, a participant of the First (1905), Second (February 1917), and Third (November 1917) Russian Revolutions, and an author of a number of books.
Biography.
Vladimir Zenzinov was born in Moscow in 1880, the son of a merchant. He studied at several universities in Germany and was known as one of the 'Heidelberg SRs'. His friendship with N.D. Avksentiev and A.R. Gots dates from that period. He joined the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR) in 1901 and returned to Russia in 1904. Arrested at the beginning of the Revolution of 1905 and sentenced to five years banishment in Siberia, he escaped to Western Europe, then returned to St. Petersburg in 1906. He worked for the PSR in various capacities and was elected to its Central Committee. He was active in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kiev. In September 1906 he was arrested again and banished to Siberia. In 1907 he escaped, making his way to Western Europe via Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo and the Suez Canal. He soon returned illegally to Russia.
Arrested again in 1910, Zenzinov was banished to northern Yakutsk to make escape impossible. There he devoted himself to ethnographic studies and wrote several pioneering anthropological works on the subject, e.g.: "Starinnye liudi u kholodnogo okeana" (Moscow, 1914) and "Ocherki torgovli na severe Yakutskoi oblasti" (Moscow, 1916). In his memoirs, he tells of some extremely isolated places he visited, such as the village of Russkoye Ustye in the Arctic Yakutia. In 1915 Zenzinov returned to European Russia and lived in Moscow and St. Petersburg. He participated in the February Revolution of 1917, played various roles in the All-Russian Soviet of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies and supported the Provisional Government under A.F. Kerensky. With respect to World War I, which bitterly divided the PSR, Zenzinov adopted a 'Revolutionary Defencist' position: opposed to the war before the February Revolution, he supported the 'defence of the revolution' against Germany. Zenzinov tried to mediate between more radical 'Defencists' (like A.A. Argunov and the 'Internationalists' led by V.M. Chernov and M.A. Natanson.
Zenzinov opposed the October Revolution. He was elected as an SR deputy to the one-day Constituent Assembly, dispersed by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Thereafter Zenzinov joined the rump Constituent Assembly government in Samara in 1918. He was briefly one of the Directors of the Provisional All-Russian Government, together with N.D. Avksentiev and others. Arrested during a military coup by Admiral Kolchak in November 1918, Zenzinov was exiled to China. From there he made his way back to Western Europe. He lived in Berlin until Hitler came to power in 1933, then moved to Paris. During this time he published several more books and worked for a variety of émigré socialist journals, including "Volya Rossiya", "Golos Rossii", "Dni", "Novaya Rossiya" and "Sovremennye Zapiski".
In 1939 Zenzinov went to Finland to witness the beginning of World War II and the Soviet attack on Finland, and to gather information on Russia. In 1940 Zenzinov emigrated to the United States, settling in New York and writing his memoirs.

The Digger's Club

The Digger's Club is an Australian mail-order seed company which specializes in unusual and heirloom plants. The company offers an extensive range of heirloom vegetables, cottage flowers and fruit plants, with the aim of providing a source of non-mainstream plants for gardeners, bypassing the major retail chains. The Digger's Club maintains two historic gardens which are open to the public, one of which is listed as a national heritage site. The Club also teaches gardening at horticultural colleges, runs workshops, and publishes gardening books. The Digger's Club focuses on preserving garden traditions and encouraging people to grow their own food in their backyards as a way to help tackle climate change. The Digger's Club is pro-organic and against genetically modified food and industrial agriculture. These issues are often addressed, alongside practical gardening information and advice, in its bi-monthly catalogues/newsletters posted to club members.
History.
The Digger's Club was founded by Clive Blazey in 1978. Its first mail order catalogue was published that year, offering 250 varieties of seeds distributed by a staff of four from an old tin shed in Albert Park, Victoria. By the end of the first year, bulbs, roses and perennial plants were included. The name "Digger's Club" is a reference to both the digging of soil and the subversive Australian cultural icon of a Digger, coined during the Victorian gold rush and both World Wars.
In 1983 Blazey purchased the historic estate of Heronswood, located at the foot of Arthur's Seat on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula, which became the new company headquarters. Heronswood joined the first Open Garden Scheme in 1986. Throughout the late eighties and early nineties the Club helped pioneer drought tolerant plants and the heirloom vegetable revival. In 1996 the Garden of St Erth in Blackwood, Victoria was purchased as well. Diggers adapted the new US hardiness zones for Australian gardens in 1998.
Gardens.
Heronswood.
Home of the Digger's Club, Heronswood is listed on the Register of the National Estate. It is also listed in "Oxford Companion to Gardens" as one of only four gardens in Victoria, alongside the Melbourne Botanical Gardens, Mawallock and Rippon Lea. The garden has extensive plantings of flowers, including perennial borders, dry climate, cottage, and annual gardens, as well as five separate vegetable gardens. The first law professor at Melbourne University, William Hearn, employed Edward Latrobe Bateman to design Heronswood's main house in 1866. The house, which is of an asymmetric Gothic Revival design, was completed in 1871. A cafe was added to the property in 1996, with the aim of showcasing local ingredients.
The Garden of St Erth.
In 1854 Matthew Rogers, a Cornish stonemason, left Sydney in pursuit of gold discovered near Mount Blackwood in Victoria. In the 1860s he built a sandstone cottage, naming it "St Erth" after his birthplace in Cornwall. Located in the Wombat State Forest, the bush garden now covers four hectares and contains over 3,000 varieties of plants, with espaliered heirloom fruit trees and a permaculture-style food forest.

Monteiro's Storm Petrel, "Oceanodroma monteiroi", is a species of seabird in the storm petrel family, Hydrobatidae. The cryptic species was once considered to be conspecific with the Band-rumped Storm Petrel. The species is apparently endemic to the Azores.
Taxonomy.
The existence of a separate species was first hinted at by the discovery of two distinct breeding seasons of "Oceanodroma" storm-petrels in the Azores. Both these populations were initially thought to be of Band-rumped Storm Petrels; however, one population bred in the cool season, and the other in the hot season. Closer study of these two breeding populations found differences in their morphology and moult. Examination of the mtDNA found that the two populations were indeed genetically isolated, and the hot-season-breeding population was elevated to a full species, "Oceanodroma monteiroi", Monteiro's Storm Petrel. The species is named for biologist Dr Luis Monteiro, who discovered it.
Breeding.
Monteiro's Storm Petrel breeds on two islets in the Azores. As in all Procellariiformes, a single egg is laid and is incubated by both parents. The egg-laying period for this species is May to early July (in contrast to the Band-rumped Storm Petrel, which on these islands lays in October–December). The first chicks hatch in June and the last chicks fledge by October. The species is thought to forage in the local seas all year round, possibly near the breeding sites; this is in contrast to the Band-rumped Storm Petrel, which disperses to the West Atlantic. Their diet is unknown, but analysis of stable isotopes in the feathers suggest that diet is different from that of the Band-rumped Storm Petrel as well.
Conservation.
The species has a low reproductive output due to competition with other burrowing petrels, and the young are preyed upon by the Long-eared Owl. The species has been assessed as Vulnerable by the IUCN because of its small population (estimated at just 250–300 pairs in 1999) and restricted breeding range (two islets in the Azores)

Royal Flags of Thailand

The Royal Flags of Thailand () are flags that are usually flown in Thailand along with the National flag to honor the King and Queen as well as the Royal Family of Thailand. Unlike the Royal Standards that are only displayed in special ceremonies and in particular locations, the royal flags are a ubiquitous sight all over Thailand. They are not seen, however, outside of the country.
Description.
There are two main royal flags, one for the King of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej, popularly known as the "Ninth king" (Rama IX), and the other for Queen Sirikit. Both flags are in plain colors with their respective royal cyphers. Other members of the royal family, like Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn and Princess Chulabhorn Walailak also have their own plain-color flags, but these are not seen very often, except at ceremonies personally led by them.
The royal flags are not only used officially, but also unofficially. They are displayed by Thai citizens of any social class or background at any location, usually beside the Thai flag, as a homage to their King and Queen. Honoring the royal family is a characteristic feature of Thai culture.
These flags are sold at most small stores and grocery stores in every town and village of Thailand. They come in many different sizes. Usually the symbol is printed only on one side of the flag.
Flag of the King.
The King's flag is in yellow, the color of Monday, the day of his birth. It always has a symbol in the middle. There are a variety of symbols, but recently most king's flags have either the symbol marking his 80th birthday or the one commemorating the 60th anniversary of his accession to the throne.
Both emblems in the center of the flag are quite complex, involving Buddhist iconography and ancient royal symbols of authority as well, like the multi-tiered white umbrella. The kings's symbols are always topped by the royal crown. Sometimes light rays are emanating from the top of the crown, these are also an element of royal symbology. In simplified versions of the flag the central symbol may come simply outlined in red.
Yellow is the color identified with the king in Thailand. Many Thais like to wear yellow shirts as an informal homage to their king, especially on Mondays, the day of his birth.
Flag of the Queen.
The Queen's flag is in blue, the color of Friday, the day of her birth. Unlike the flag of the king, her flag has always the same symbol in the middle. The symbol is her acronym, the white letter intertwined with the dark blue letter, below a yellow or golden royal crown, sometimes with a pink scroll with Thai writing underneath.
In simplified versions of the flag this symbol may come simply outlined in white on the blue ground. This flag is mostly displayed around August, the month of the Queen's birth.

Narcisse Théophile Patouillard

Narcisse Théophile Patouillard (July 2, 1854 - March 30, 1926) was a French pharmacist and mycologist. 
He was born in Macornay, a town in the department of Jura. He studied in Besançon, then furthered his education at the "École Supérieure de Pharmacie" in Paris, where in 1884 he earned a diploma with a doctoral thesis involving the structure and classification of Hymenomycetes called ""Des Hyménomycètes au point de vue de leur structure et de leur classification"".
Patouillard was a practicing pharmacist for more than forty years, first in Poligny (1881–84), and later in Fontenay-sous-Bois (1884–85), Paris (1886–1898) and Neuilly-sur-Seine (beginning in 1898). From 1893 to 1900, he was "préparateur" to the chair of cryptogamy at the "École Supérieure de Pharmacie" in Paris. In 1920 he became an honorary member of the British Mycological Society. He died in Paris, aged 71.
Patouillard is highly regarded for his taxonomical work in mycology, and during his career, he described numerous genera and species of fungi. The following are some of the genera that he is the taxonomic authority of: "Guepiniopsis", "Hirsutella", "Lacrymaria", "Leucocoprinus", "Melanoleuca" and "Spongipellis". A mycological species called "Inocybe patouillardii" (brick-red tear mushroom) is one of the species named after him.
He was the author of nearly 250 works, and was a leading authority on tropical mycology. Over 100 of his publications involved studies of fungi from diverse locales such as Brazil, Java, Guadeloupe, Mexico, New Caledonia, the Gambier Islands, Philippines, et al.

The Layover EP

The Layover EP is the first EP by Dilated Peoples member Evidence, released on November 25, 2008 by Decon.
Background.
The idea for "The Layover EP" originally came about while he was on tour with Little Brother. It was originally going to be a 5 track release produced entirely by North Carolina producer Khrysis for free download. He later decided to up the ante and make it an official release. Evidence cites Ice Cube's "Kill at Will", Pete Rock & CL Smooth's "All Souled Out" and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's "Creepin on ah Come Up" as influences for the project, mini LP's that served an eager fan base with enduring, concentrated, filler-free product.
DJ Premier ranked the album 2nd in his top 20 albums of 2008 list.
In the video for "The Far Left" when The Alchemist says "To the atmosphere so I can really find out" he holds up a drawing of a slug and an ant. This is a reference to the hip hop group Atmosphere, which consist of rapper Slug and producer Ant.
"The Layover Mixtape".
In addition with the release of "The Layover EP", Evidence collaborated with DJ Skee to produce "The Layover Mixtape" which was available on Evidence's Myspace for free download. Other collaborators featured on the mixtape include Defari, Bishop Lamont, Chace Infinite, Dilated Peoples, U-N-I, Big Pooh, Aloe Blacc, Fashawn, Mickey Factz, Theo, Kes Kaos, Phonte, Montage One, Mitchy Slick, Big Twin, Diz Gibran, Stylistik Jones, Krondon, Rakaa Iriscience, as well as Crooked I. The mixtape tracklisting varies with songs from "The Layover EP", commercial tracks that Evidence rapped over, and Dilated Peoples' "Fresh Rhymes and Videotape EP".

Gayle Williams

Gayle Williams (18 December 1973 – 20 October 2008) was an aid worker for SERVE Afghanistan of joint British and South African nationality. She was shot on her way to work in Kabul, Afghanistan by two men on a motorbike. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, claimed responsibility for her death and said she had been killed "because she was working for an organization which was preaching Christianity in Afghanistan".
Education and early career.
Williams was born in Zimbabwe and raised in Empangeni, KwaZulu Natal. Her mother took her to live in Middlesbrough, England during her secondary school years, after which she went back to South Africa to study biokinetics and occupational therapy at the University of Zululand. Afterward, she returned to London to work with disabled and deprived children.
Work in Afghanistan.
Williams had been fascinated with Afghanistan, and worked with Afghan refugees in camps in Pakistan, starting to learn Dari and Pashtu. She was determined to work in-country and was stationed in the Taliban heartland of Kandahar in 2006, working with disabled children, blind and deaf children, and children hurt and maimed by landmines and fighting in the country.
The charity SERVE Afghanistan is Christian in its beliefs, but denies that it tried to spread Christianity. Colleagues stressed that Williams was extremely careful not to try to convert Afghans.
She was well aware of the risks of working in Afghanistan. Some 4,000 people had been killed there in 2008, of whom one third were civilians. Taliban violence had been targeted against aid workers to spread fear and undermine the Government's claims to be bringing security. In April 2008, because of the danger to charity workers there, Serve recalled its staff from Kandahar to Kabul.
Williams had attended the funeral of a colleague a few weeks before her own death, and expressed a wish to be buried in the same Christian cemetery in Kabul if she were to die in Afghanistan. A friend recounted at her funeral that she said, "These bodies are only temporary. When I get to heaven I will have a new body."
Responses to her death.
Gayle Williiams' death was headline news in the UK.
Douglas Alexander, UK Secretary of State for International Development, condemned the murder: "Her killing was a callous and cowardly act by people who would take Afghanistan back to the dark days of the Taliban tyranny which scarred the country for so long."
Mike Lythe, head of Serve Afghanistan, said, "This is a tragedy... She knew the dangers, but Afghanistan is where she wanted to be." Following the killing, the organisation suspended its work in the country. The Foreign Office also updated its advice for people travelling to the country, stating that no part should be "considered immune from violence".
The London-based scholar Ziauddin Sardar described the killing as "another barbaric act in the name of Islam" and called on all Muslims to condemn the Taliban.
Following Williams' funeral, her mother and sister met President Hamid Karzai who wished to express his condolences. Her sister Karen Williams stated that they had forgiven the killers as Gayle would have done.
The family arranged a memorial service in London the week after. They asked for no flowers but for donations to be sent for the welfare of deprived Afghan children.
Responding to the murder of Gayle Williams, there were some calls by atheists for Christians to end evangelism. However, a worldwide commission of evangelical Christian theologians, meeting in Bangkok on 23–25 October, reaffirmed the importance of holistic mission.
A "prayer walk" for Williams' family and colleagues was arranged for 8 November 2008 in London, stopping to pray outside embassies of countries where Christian believers face persecution.
The Centre for Safety and Development, which gives training to avoid attacks on humanitarian workers, notes that Williams trustfully walked the same route to work each day, and advises workers with NGOs to take more precautions.

Mexican paradox

The Mexican paradox is the observation that the Mexican people exhibit a surprisingly low incidence of low birth weight (LBW), contrary to what would be expected from their socioeconomic status (SES). This appears as an outlier in graphs correlating SES with low-birth-weight rates. 
It has been proposed that resistance to changes in diet is responsible for the positive birth weight association for Mexican-American mothers.
Nevertheless, the medical causes of lower rates of low birth weights among birthing Mexican mothers has been called into question.
The results of the study showed that the mean birth weight of Mexican-American babies was 3.34 kg (7.37 lbs), while that of non-Hispanic White babies was 3.39 kg (7.48 lbs.). This finding re-emphasized the independence of mean birth weight and LBW. This however did not refute the discrepancies in LBW for Mexicans. 
The study also showed that the overall preterm birth rate was higher among Mexican Americans (10.6%) than non-Hispanic Whites (9.3%). 
The overall hypothesis of the authors was that this finding reflected an error in recorded gestational age, described in a strongly bimodal birth-weight distribution at young gestational ages for Mexican-Americans.

Sins (TV miniseries)

Sins is a 1986 CBS television miniseries starring Joan Collins. An adaptation of the 1982 novel of the same name by Judith Gould, it is the story of a woman who survives the horrors of the Nazi occupation of France and suffers a succession of challenges as she rises in the world of fashion.
Produced by New World Television, Collins also served as executive producer with her then-husband Peter Holm, and the mini-series contained 85 costume changes for her role (a record for a single production). Carly Simon co-wrote and performed the theme song, "It's Hard to be Tender."
Plot.
Helene Junot is a successful businesswoman and a leading name in the world of fashion. In 1980s New York, she attends a reception for the launch of her new magazine, "Woman Of Today", which could make or break her publishing company. Meanwhile, several people from Helene's past are conspiring to destroy her.
Born in France, Helene grew up during World War II. When she was 13, the Gestapo (led by the sadistic Nazi commander, Karl Von Eiderfeld) murdered her pregnant mother when she was caught sending messages for the Allied Forces. Meanwhile, Helene is raped and brutalised at the hands of the Nazis. Though she later escapes from their clutches, her younger brother and sister, Edmund and Marie, have been deported to a concentration camp.
In 1949, with the war over, Helene goes to work as a dressmaker with her aunt at the grand home of the Count and Countess De Ville. There, she begins to show her talents as a fashion designer and also is wooed by the Count's son, Hubert. However, Hubert's parents do not approve of him seeing a "servant girl" which ends their romance and Helene leaves.
In 1955, Helene moves to Paris and begins working for leading fashion designer, Odile. After a couple of years working as a model, Odile makes Helene a director at her fashion house. In 1959, Helene meets and falls in love with an American army officer named David Westfield when he is visiting Paris, but their affair is short-lived when David is transferred to Vietnam and is killed in action. At the same time, Helene has hired an investigator named Otto Mueller, as she wants to find her brother and sister and the Gestapo commander responsible for the death of her mother years earlier. However, the search will be costly, and Helene agrees to become the mistress of the abusive Count De Ville (Hubert's father) in order to finance her search, much to Hubert's dismay and humiliation. Mueller succeeds in finding Helene's brother Edmund, now a grown man but living in a mental institution in a permanently catatonic state after years of torture and abuse at the hands of the Nazis. Helene takes him home with her and hires a doctor and a nurse to bring him back to health. 
Helene also meets American composer Eric Hovland, an older man whom she falls in love with and marries. However, their marriage is short-lived when Hubert De Ville, still obsessed with Helene, breaks into their home and tries to rape her. When Eric tries to protect her, Hubert murders him, but threatens to use his family connections to blame Helene for the crime if she reports him. Helene reluctantly agrees and tells the police it was an accident, but then discovers that the incident and their conversation afterwards had been taped as Eric was recording music at his piano at the time. She then blackmails the De Villes for 100 million francs, or she will have Hubert arrested for murder and destroy their family's reputation. Count De Ville reluctantly agrees and Helene uses the money to begin her own fashion magazine, "Couture". However her victory over the De Villes is bittersweet as she finds out she is pregnant with Eric's child, but miscarries and learns she can never have children because of an injury she sustained after being raped by the Nazis during the war. Soon after, Otto Mueller contacts Helene as he has tracked down the ex-Nazi commander Karl Von Eiderfeld, who is now a wealthy businessman living in Austria. Helene and Edmund have him prosecuted as a Nazi war criminal and he is sentenced to life imprisonment, but vows to have revenge on Helene.
In the 1960s, Helene then throws herself into her work and Couture becomes a huge success, while Edmund marries his nurse, Jeanne. However, when she is pregnant with their first child, Jeanne becomes ill. The baby is born prematurely but Jeanne dies, leaving Edmund to raise their daughter, Natalie, alone. Meanwhile, Helene meets Italian publisher Marcello D'Itri, who tries to secure a loan from her to save his floundering fashion magazine. Helene offers to buy his magazine, on the condition that it is renamed "Couture Italiana", but with Marcello kept on as editor-in-chief, to which he agrees. But whilst she is in Venice, Helene then runs into David Westfield, the American officer she fell in love with years earlier, who did not die in Vietnam as reported and has been trying to contact Helene for years. Now a U.S. congressman, David asks Helene to marry him, but David's mother does not approve of their engagement as she feels it will ruin David's future career due to Helene's somewhat chequered past. Also knowing that she cannot give David children, Helene reluctantly breaks off their engagement.
Some years later in the 1970s, Helene's empire has expanded and she hires American architect Steve Bryant, and his jealous wife Zizi, to design and build a new skyscraper, named the Junot Tower, in New York. Steve falls in love with Helene, much to Zizi's annoyance, but their relationship remains platonic.
In 1982, at a fancy dress ball in Venice to mark the 50th issue of Couture Italiana, Helene learns that Marcello has been embezzling from the magazine behind her back, and she forces him to resign. Helene once again meets David Hillfield at the party, who is now a married U.S. senator. Moments later, Hubert De Ville arrives at the ball to gloat that Karl Von Eiderfeld was released from prison that day. Some time later, Helene finally begins a relationship with Steve Bryant, but when his wife Zizi finds the two of them together, Steve suffers a heart attack and dies. Zizi blames Helene for his death.
A couple of years later, Helene's enemies; Karl Von Eiderfeld, Hubert De Ville, Marcello D'Itri, and Zizi Bryant, join forces in a conspiracy to destroy her. Helene has launched a new magazine, "Woman Of Today", but has taken out huge loans and sold off a large amount of stock in her company, Junot Publications, in order to finance it. When the first issue is a failure, Helene's enemies buy up large portions of the stock between them. They also manage to lure Helene's long-time editorial associate, Luba Tcherina, away from her, whilst bribing her banker, Adam Gore, into calling in her outstanding loans so that she will become bankrupt. However, Marcello and Zizi are not content to merely ruin Helene, they want to kill her and hire a hitman with an attack dog to mutilate her. Helene's enemies are foiled, first when her banker Adam Gore is exposed for fraud and commits suicide, saving Helene from bankruptcy, and then when an attempt on her life fails. Her enemies then turn on themselves, and in an ensuing struggle, Zizi shoots and kills Von Eiderfeld. Meanwhile, Helene has gained precious time to relaunch her new magazine, this time with her talented niece Natalie at the helm. The second issue is a huge success, but not before Helene is shot by the hitman who was hired to kill her as he attempts to carry out his contract. However, she is only wounded and survives, whilst David kills the hitman. After she recovers, David divorces his wife and the two of them later marry. Finally finding true happiness, Helene decides to hand her publishing empire over to Natalie to run.

Modern Vampires

Modern Vampires (also billed as Revenant) is a 1998 black horror/comedy film that was released Oct 19, 1999 straight to video, written by Matthew Bright and directed by Richard Elfman.
Most of the storyline is about a vampire named Dallas, a young WW2 veteran who was banished by "The Count" (the film's interpretation of Count Dracula, who is mostly portrayed as a mob-boss type figure). Dallas is given a chance to visit America for the first time in years while unknowingly being pursued by Dr. Fredrick Van Helsing (portrayed as a former Nazi doctor) who hires a group of street thugs to help him do his dirty work. At the same time, we are introduced to Nico, a sultry vampire posing as a prostitute who lures unsuspecting victims to their doom.
Plot.
Dallas (Casper Van Dien) is not a very discriminating vampire. Years ago, in an effort to save the life of Hans, the crippled son of famed Viennese vampire hunter Doctor Frederick Van Helsing, he turned him into a vampire, without permission from The Count (Robert Pastorelli). It's later revealed that he turned young and waifish Nico (Natasha Gregson Wagner), who has since been on a killing spree across Los Angeles earning her the nickname "Hollywood Slasher", which infuriates The Count, who orders her immediate death. Even with both Van Helsing and The Count on his tail and after 20 years in exile, Dallas can't resist returning to L.A. to pay a visit to his dearest friends — beautiful Ulrike (Kim Cattrall), urbane Vincent (Udo Kier), artist Richard (Craig Ferguson) and Richard's ever-pregnant wife Panthia (Natasha Andrejchenko). To celebrate Dallas' return, the five of them decide to spend the night clubbing in one of The Count's many vampire bars. Unfortunately, The Count is also there. When he sees Dallas is back in town, he gives him three days to leave or else.
Dr. Van Helsing (Rod Steiger), leader of Van Helsing's Institute of Vienna, also has his eye on the band of merrymaking vampires. "It's an infestation" he concludes, and realizes that he can't handle the extermination alone. So, he puts an ad in the newspaper looking for a "strong and brave young man who's not afraid to get his hands dirty in a cause that is holy." What he gets is Crips member Time Bomb (Gabriel Casseus), who doesn't believe in vampires but is willing to put a stake through anyone's heart for cold hard cash. The pair succeed in killing Vincent.
After killing Vincent, Van Helsing tells Time Bomb that 20 years ago his son Hans became good friends with Dallas who promised to save his life from a fatal genetic disorder by turning him into a vampire. He eventually discovered on his own by finding out his wife was secretly visiting Hans late night at a family mausoleum. He then killed Hans with a stake through the heart, and mentions that after killing Hans, his wife committed suicide out of grief. Van Helsing makes it abundantly clear that he will destroy Dallas.
Dallas is feeling protective (and a little curious) about his protegee Nico, so he drives around Hollywood Boulevard that night until he spots her. After sharing a bit of each other's blood, Dallas reveals who he is and explains that the vampire community is out to get her. They're afraid that Nico will get herself arrested and then the whole world will know that vampires exist. Dallas forces her to move from the junked oil tanker in which she sleeps and to come live with Richard and Panthia who clean her up and take her shopping for some new clothes. Panthia develops a mother-like complex towards Nico and starts treating her like a daughter.
When they pick another victim at a late night coffee shop, Nico makes a human friend named Rachel (Natasha Lyonne). But, when they return to Richard and Panthia's house, they find Ulrike sitting on her car hood, crying. She has discovered Vincent's decaptiated body. Knowing that this was Van Helsing's handywork, Dallas theorizes that he's closing in on them. Dallas then decides to take Nico to see her mother's house since Nico doesn't remember much about her past during her human life. This turns out to be a bad idea, as Nico has him kill her verbally and sexually abusive stepfather as payback for all that "sex shit" he did to her when she was little. Nico exchanges heated words with her neglectful mother, who she claims never loved her. As they leave the trailer park, they are attacked by four of The Count's henchmen. Dallas and Nico manage to shoot three of them and set fire to the fourth.
Dallas then tells his side of the story to Nico - Originally Dallas was ordered to kill Van Hellsing, but he ended up befriending Hans and decided not to. After saving Hans from the genetic disorder, he hoped that his father's attitude would change towards the vampire community, but it didn't. Van Helsing became vengeful towards Dallas and killed Hans. The Count then banished Dallas as punishment for not carrying out his order to kill him.
The next night, while Richard, Panthia, and Ulrike are sitting around the living room and listening to music, Nico gets a call from her new friend Rachel and Invites Nico out to a small party with some delinquent teenagers, and Nico is eager to go. Meanwhile, Dallas pays a visit to The Count and begs to be allowed to train Nico. The Count will have none of it and advises Dallas to deliver Nico to him or he and everyone he cares about "will die screaming".
Having come to the conclusion that even two vampire hunters will not be enough against the vampire infestation, Van Helsing and Time Bomb bring in three more Crips members - Soda Pop (Victor Togunde), L'il Monster (Cedrick Terrell), and Trigger (Flex Alexander). While Nico and Dallas are out, Van Helsing and his four employees storm the house and drive stakes through Richard and Panthia. They tie Ulrike to a bedpost, but she taunts the Crips into having sex with her before Van Helsing finally stakes her, too. Little do they know that to have sex with a vampire turns a person into a vampire. Suddenly, Nico walks in, horrified at the carnage. She attacks Trigger, who pulls a gun and tries to get off a shot. The bullet hits Rachel instead. Nico grabs the gun and shoots Trigger. Time Bomb subdues Nico with a rope of garlic, just as Dallas returns home and comes face to face with Van Helsing. In exchange for letting Nico go, Dallas offers to lead Van Helsing to The Count. So, Van Helsing, Time Bomb, Trigger, L'il Monster, Soda Pop, Nico, Rachel and Dallas pile into Van Helsing's van and head for The Count's house. Unfortunately, The Count's henchmen intercept them and take Nico and Van Helsing to The Count, where he hooks up Nico to a blood-draining machine and places Van Helsing in a box with only his head sticking out. Just as The Count is about to crack open Van Helsing's skull with a hammer, Dallas drives the van through the wall of the club. Dallas and the Crips, now vampires, come out shooting. Many bullets and stakes later, The Count and his henchmen are destroyed, Nico is set free, Rachel has been made into a vampire, and Nico, Rachel, and Dallas have decided to move to New York. In the closing scene, a pajama-clad Van Helsing runs down an alley, screaming for forgiveness from his son. As he utters apologies to God and his son Hans, he screams for help, revealing his new vampire fangs in front of two policemen.
Reception.
The movie has received third place Best International Film award at the Fant-Asia Film Festival in 1997.

Indiana State Sycamores

The Indiana State University Sycamores are the intercollegiate athletic teams of Indiana State University. They are members of the Missouri Valley Conference, joining in the 1977-78 academic year; past conference memberships include the Indiana College Athletic League (1895–1922), the Indiana Intercollegiate Conference (1922–1950), the Indiana Collegiate Conference, (1950–1968) and the Midwestern Conference (1970–1972). The Women's teams were members of the Gateway Conference (est. 1985) prior to the Gateway merging with the Missouri Valley Conference in 1992.
History.
'Sycamores' nickname and evolution of mascot.
Early on in the school's history, the athletes were referred to as the "Fighting Teachers" (the school's original name was "Indiana State Teachers College), until the students chose the name "Sycamores", due to the abundance of sycamore trees in Indiana and especially in the Wabash River Valley; though it is believed that the students voted on 'Sycamores' on a lark, never thinking it would win. During the 1950s and 1960s, the sycamore tree itself was used as Indiana State's mascot. However, as a tree does not lend itself well to an athletic mascot, especially considering Indiana State's in-state rivalries with the Ball State Cardinals and Butler Bulldogs, the university created an Indian mascot named "Chief Quabachi", and his "Princess", in 1969. This change paid homage to the fact that ISU was the "State" university of a state named after Indians (prior to statehood Indiana was primarily inhabited by Indians). The university dropped the "Chief Quabachi" mascot in 1989 in response to a variety of objections over use of the Indian caricature and did not have another mascot until 1995, when a blue-and-white "furry woodland creature" named "Sycamore Sam" was developed to replace Chief Quabachi and continues to serve as Indiana State's mascot.

Gary Pig Gold

Gary Pig Gold (born May 30, 1955 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is a singer-songwriter, record producer, filmmaker and author. His fanzine The Pig Paper was Canada’s first independently-published music magazine, and among the recording artists he has worked with are Pat Boone, Dave Rave, Endless Summer, Simply Saucer and Shane Faubert.
History.
He formed his first band, Pornographic Cornflake (named after "I Am the Walrus" lyric) at age thirteen, and his first 16mm film made four years later, a documentary about his hometown entitled "This is Port Credit!", was chosen to be aired on a local PBS Television affiliate after winning an award at a high school film competition. Due to its libelous nature however, Gold was advised to indemnify himself from possible legal action by crediting the film to a fictitious director. Eating breakfast the morning the credits were to be re-shot, a plastic pig stamper fell from his cereal box and the pseudonym Gary Pig was adopted.
Under this nom de plume, Gold began self-publishing The Pig Paper in 1973 and distributing it by mail to friends. Visiting London two years later he met Joe Strummer, then leading The 101ers, who encouraged Gold to continue his writing. That winter, he published a mock concert program commemorating an appearance by The Who in Toronto, and in 1977 a similar "Pig Paper" on The Kinks became the first issue to be made available outside of Canada, when Gold followed the band to a concert and record signing in Buffalo, New York.
The featured interviewee of that "Pig Paper" was Edgar Breau, whose band Simply Saucer Gold began managing and producing, releasing their first record June 8, 1978 on Pig Records. It was voted Single Of The Week in London’s "Record Mirror" the following month. By then,"The Pig Paper" was being distributed throughout the U.S. and Europe, offering early in-depth coverage of The Viletones, Ramones, Half Japanese, Elvis Costello and Talking Heads as well as features on such vintage acts as The Hollies and Dave Clark Five.
Immediately after attending a Jan and Dean concert in Toronto during the summer of 1980, Gold relocated to California where he formed The Loved Ones, as well as promoting concerts for local bands such as The Crowd over the next three years. He spent the remainder of the decade back in Canada, first joining the Vancouver-based Fun With Numbers band before touring five years with Endless Summer. In 1989, he returned to the studio, working in Nashville alongside Donald Dunn and Pat Boone, then at Daniel Lanois’ Grant Avenue Studio with Dave Rave DesRoches and Coyote Shivers, the latter sessions resulting in the "Valentino’s Pirates" album, which became the first independently-recorded western release to be issued on the Soviet Union’s Melodiya record label.
After relocating to New York City with DesRoches and Shivers to form the Dave Rave Conspiracy alongside Billy Ficca of Television and ex-Washington Squares Lauren Agnelli, Gold co-founded the pioneering alternative-country band The Ghost Rockets, whose "maximum rhythm ‘n’ bluegrass" cover of the Beach Boys’ “In My Room” became a radio “turntable hit” in Europe. Another song, “Marcia Marcia Marcia,” written by Gold for the "A Very Brady Sequel" movie, appeared instead on the King Records label in New Zealand, to be followed by dozens of other Ghost Rockets releases worldwide.
Gold meanwhile produced two albums for Shane Faubert, formerly of The Cheepskates, with whom he began the To M’Lou Music label in 1998, releasing the acclaimed debut album of the Los Angeles band The Masticators as well as "He’s A Rebel: The Gene Pitney Story Retold", which included exclusive recordings by Billy Cowsill, Mick Farren, Gordon Waller and Al Kooper. Gold contributed tracks himself to the Bullseye Records of Canada "Men In Plaid" Bay City Rollers tribute album as well as singing alongside Jim Carroll for "Back To The Streets: Celebrating the Music of Don Covay", and with Andrew Loog Oldham on the 1993 issue of Alex Chilton’s "Bach’s Bottom" album.
Concurrently, he continued writing, for Visible Ink Press’ "Music Hound" Essential Album Guides as well as "Bubblegum Music Is The Naked Truth", "Encounters With Bob Dylan", "Lost In The Grooves", "Paul McCartney: I Saw Him Standing There", "TV A-Go-Go," "Treat Me Like Dirt: An Oral History of Punk in Toronto and Beyond 1977-1981", and "The Little Black Book of Music", plus to this day his syndicated "Pigshit" column (first appearing in Los Angeles "Flipside" Magazine in 1979) runs monthly online. He was also a featured interview subject in the "Jandek On Corwood" documentary film.
In 2008, Gold began work at John Huelbig’s Backroom Studios in Wallington, New Jersey, writing, performing and producing with such artists as Mark Johnson, Chris Butler, Dave Rave and Frank Lee Sprague.

George F. Cotterill

George Fletcher Cotterill (November 18, 1865 – October 13, 1958), born in Oxford, England, was an American civil servant and politician. His public career in Seattle and the state of Washington lasted over 40 years; his politics were generally aligned with Progressivism. An advocate of woman suffrage and Prohibition, he was also concerned with the development of public parks and with public ownership of port and harbor facilities and of utilities.
Youth and early career.
Born in Oxford, England, Cotterill was the son of a gardener Robert Cotterill and his wife Alice. The family immigrated to the United States in May 1872, when he was six, arriving in Boston before settling on a farm in Montclair, New Jersey. After graduating from high school in Montclair—at the young age of 15 and as class valedictorian—he worked as a rod man on a railroad survey, while training to be a surveyor and engineer.
In 1883, he traveled to the Pacific Northwest with his father and brother. They had hoped to find work for the Northern Pacific Railroad, but by the time they arrived the project in question had been suspended. His father and brother headed back East in 1884. Cotterill stayed on and managed to obtain a job as a bookkeeper for the Moran Brothers shipyard in Seattle. Moran and Cotterill would each later serve the city as its mayor.
He was not a bookkeeper for long. The growing town and the Washington Territory needed surveyors and engineers. Cotterill laid out the seating diagram for Frye Opera House (Seattle's premier theater of its time), worked for the Columbia & Puget Sound Railway, the Seattle, Lake Shore & Eastern Railway, and eventually for the Northern Pacific when they resumed development in the region. He was involved with the coal mines in Gilman (now Issaquah, Washington) and Grand Ridge. He surveyed land in West Seattle (which at that time was not yet part of Seattle proper) and laid out the plan of the city of Sidney (later Port Orchard) in Kitsap County. Most importantly for his future career, though, he worked for City of Seattle Surveyor R. H. Thomson, both as a surveyor and in building the city's first sewers.
Thomson and Cotterill.
Thomson became City Engineer in 1892 and appointed Cotterill as an assistant. They developed the basis of what remains Seattle's main water supply over a century later ("see Seattle Public Utilities"), bringing in water from the Cedar River. The financial hurdles were almost as daunting as the technical difficulties. In a July 8, 1889 election, barely a month after the Great Seattle Fire (June 6, 1889) Seattle's citizens had voted 1,875 to 51 to acquire and operate their own water system. However, the Panic of 1893 wrecked the city's finances. Cotterill devised the then-novel plan of borrowing money for the pipeline by pledging the receipts from the water to be delivered when the $1,250,000 system was completed. This brought Cotterill into electoral politics for the first time, supporting his own plan in an 1895 special election. The Klondike Gold Rush put Seattle on a sound economic footing and the 1901 completion of Cedar River Supply System No. 1 (active from February 21, 1901) gave the city a steady supply of clean water.
Other achievements by Thomson and Cotterill in this era included 25 miles of bicycle trails (later the basis of the city's Olmsted boulevard system) the filling of tideflats that compose much of today's SoDo and Industrial District south of Downtown Seattle, and the development of the plats that still determine the general plan of the piers on Seattle's Central Waterfront. Each pier is more or less a parallelogram. Most earlier piers, none of which survive, formed a perfect right angle to the shore, and the curvature of the shore meant that each pier was at a slightly different angle, causing potential for collisions. Their uniform northeast-southwest direction was prescribed by Thomson and Cotterill not only solved that problem but also spared freight trains from needing to make a sharp right angle.
Politics.
An increasingly prominent figure in the city, Cotterill was soon embroiled in matters unrelated to his technical skills (or even his financial skills)
Gold Rush money had turned Seattle into a wide open city: brothels and casinos flourished, as did concomitant corruption. Cotterill had been a Republican, but in 1900 he supported populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan for President and ran for mayor of Seattle, nominally as a nonpartisan, but effectively as a Democratic. It was not the Democrats' year, and Cotterill lost (as he would also lose a Congressional race two years later). He resigned his city job and resumed private practice.
In 1906, he finally achieved electoral success as one of only three Democrats elected to the Washington State Senate, which then had 42 members. Crossing the aisle, he became the leader of progressive Republicans, and successfully built support for the direct primary law of 1907. As a legislator, he also backed the Lake Washington Ship Canal and helped preserve shorelines for the University of Washington and for city parks. He backed local option as a step toward the prohibition of alcohol and drafted an amendment to the state constitution that granted women the right to vote in 1910, a decade ahead of the country at large. He was also instrumental in passing the law that allowed formation of port districts. The workman's compensation law he helped to write became a national model.
Cotterill was the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in 1908 and 1910, but lost both races.
Mayor of Seattle.
Hiram Gill ran successfully for the Seattle mayoralty in 1910 on "open city" platform, defeating real estate man George W. Dilling. Gill opposed municipal ownership of utilities, arguing not only for privatized transit, but for privatized waterworks, and opposing the then-young Seattle City Light electric utility. He was generally anti-tax and anti-union. Gill reinstalled police chief Charles "Wappy" Wappenstein, whom Gill's predecessor John F. Miller had dismissed as corrupt. Wappenstein promptly established a regime far more "open" than any that Gill had overtly advocated. Every prostitute in Seattle was expected to pay $10 a month to "Wappy", and the police department made sure they paid. Beacon Hill became home to a 500-room brothel with a 15-year lease from the city. It did not take long for the voters to get fed up, and Gill was recalled from office in 1911, though it would not be his last time as mayor. Dilling finished out Gill's term. Wappenstein eventually went to prison.
Gill ran for mayor again in March 1912, and Cotterill ran against him. "Seattle Times" publisher Alden J. Blethen ardently supported Gill, but Cotterill won. The election wasn't even close, and a third candidate, Socialist Hulet Wells, received nearly as many votes as Gill. Reformers, many of them with no party affiliation, formed the majority of the Seattle City Council. Theodore Roosevelt's "Bull Moose" candidacy carried the stat in the presidential election later that year, though Roosevelt did not win the country.
Although in some ways his moment of triumph, Cotterill was by this time, in Roger Sales's words, riding "two horses… moving in different directions". His desire for municipal ownership of utilities and public control of ports allied him with labor and populism; his lifelong Prohibitionist views did not. The Prohibitionist movement was, by this time, aligning itself with issues that wanted small government on most other issues, because they had come to believe that big government inevitably meant corruption. Meanwhile, labor was moving farther left, toward socialism and even anarcho-syndicalism.
Prohibitionism and the temperance movement had always been at the center of Cotterill's morality. His parents had been members of the United Kingdom Temperance Alliance. During his childhood in England, he attended the Band of Hope, an organization for children's temperance education. His mother had formed the local chapter. He attended a convention of the International Order of Good Templars in 1897 and was involved with the Templars for the rest of his life, serving for a time as Grand Secretary of the Washington State division and later as Chief Templar of the national division. He was a member of the Anti-Saloon League and in 1909, was appointed by President Taft to represent the U.S. at the International Congress against Alcoholism; in 1913 he was reappointed to this role by President Wilson.
As mayor, Cotterill instigated an anti-vice campaign that raised civil liberties issues, and he soon became embroiled in other issues, as well. There were thousands of vice-related warrantless arrests, and the crackdown on vice may simply have created new and different modes of police corruption.
At this time, Seattle had a big summer celebration known as Potlatch Days, the name deriving from the potlatch ceremonies of the indigenous peoples of the region. In summer 1913, during the Golden Potlach celebration, Blethen succeeded in stirring up already hot tempers and sparking a riot that destroyed the local offices of the Industrial Workers of the World and of the Socialist Party. Cotterill shut down the saloons, suspended all street meetings, and attempted to close the "Seattle Times". In this last, he was stopped by a judge; he and police chief Claude Bannick nearly found themselves arrested. However, he survived a recall attempt instigated by Blethen.
That was hardly the last of the labor troubles Cotterill faced as mayor. Later that year, the Teamsters struck for union recognition and a closed shop. Cotterill attempted to remain neutral, which the employers viewed as support for the union.
Later career.
Rather than seek reelection as mayor, in 1914 Cotterill ran again for the United States Senate. Again, he lost. In 1916, he was appointed Chief Engineer of the state highway department. In 1922, he was elected to the first of four three-year terms on the Seattle Port Commission, after which he worked a variety of jobs, including working for the King County Assessor's Office until retiring at the age of 84. 
Cotterill seems never go have given up hopes of resuming a career in electoral politics. He ran for governor in 1928 and for at least five various city and state offices between 1932 and 1951. His finances fared poorly in the Great Depression, which was part of the reason he worked into his 80s. Most likely, he would have worked even longer if the state had not adopted a mandatory retirement law for government employees over 70.
Roughly a decade after his retirement, he died in a Seattle nursing home.

Afro-Brazilian literature

Afro-Brazilian literature has existed in Brazil since the mid-19th century with the publication of Maria Firmina dos Reis's novel "Ursula" in 1859. Other writers from the late 19th century and early 20th century include Machado de Assis, Cruz e Sousa and Lima Barreto. Yet, Afro-Brazilian literature as a genre that recognized the ethnic and cultural origins of the writer did not gain national prominence in Brazil until the 1970s with the revival of Black Consciousness politics known as the Movimento Negro.
History.
Literature written by individuals or groups of African ancestry in the present-day nation of Brazil, it can trace its origins to the 19th century. However, oral traditions of histories and narratives can be traced back to the 16th century when African slaves were brought across the Atlantic to work in the Portuguese colonies. Written forms of Afro-Brazilian literature do not appear until the 19th century with publications by writers such as Maria Firmina dos Reis, Cruz e Sousa and Machado de Assis.
There also existed during the 19th century a vast wealth of literature on Afro-Brazilians written by White Brazilians. Many of these writers were abolitionists that included Castro Alves, Joaquim Nabuco, Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, and Naturalist writers that included Aluísio Azevedo, Jose Veríssimo, and Raul Pompéia. The well known Bahian author of the 20th century, Jorge Amado, also included many aspects of Afro-Brazilian culture and religion in many of his novels such as Tenda dos Milagres (Tent of Miracles) and A Morte e a Morte de Quincas Berro Dágua (The Two Deaths of Quincas Wateryell).
With the largest population of African descendants outside of Africa found in Brazil, the importance of focusing on Afro-Brazilian literature has increased in recent years with the publication of multiple anthologies and literary criticisms revolving around Afro-Brazilian writers. Furthermore, Afro-Brazilian literature reflects the complex relationship between Brazil's long history of slavery, its politics of branqueamento (racial whitening) that were implemented by the Brazilian government during the late 19th and beginning of the 20th century, and the myth of racial democracy that pervaded and still exists within the Brazilian national consciousness.
Major writers/contributors.
19th century.
Maria Firmina dos Reis.
Born in São Luiz do Maranhão October 11, 1825, Maria was a mulata woman living in a segregated society. Her maternal aunt was crucial in her education as well the writer Sotero dos Reis. During the beginning of the 1880s, she creates the first free and coed state school in Maranhão while simultaneously maintaining a constant presence in the local press publishing poetry, fiction and chronicles. In 1859, she publishes her best known book, "Úrsula" which focuses on the issue of slavery from the perspective of the "Other". Because of the attitudes regarding the silencing and submission of women in 19th-century Brazilian society, Maria Firmina dos Reis omits her name from the cover of "Úrsula" and writes the pseudonym "Uma Maranhense” (A Maranhese woman). It is not until 1975, when Horácio de Almeida publishes a facsimile of "Úrsula", that Maria Firmina dos Reis is revealed as the author of the book.
Machado de Assis.
Considered to be the greatest Brazilian writer and the first writer to be inducted into the Brazilian Academy of Letters, Machado de Assis was a mulatto (more specifically, a quadroon) whose grandparents were slaves.
20th century.
Quilombhoje.
An Afro-Brazilian literary group founded by a group of Paulistanos in 1980 by Cuti, Oswaldo de Camargo, Paulo Colina, Abelardo Rodrigues and others, its objective was to discuss and deepen the understanding of Afro-Brazilians in literature. It also desired to promote the habit of reading and to develop and to encourage studies, research and analysis concerning Black literature and culture. The group is best known for its annual publication of "Cadernos Negros" (Black Notebooks), an anthology of poetry, fiction, and essays by Afro-Brazilian writers, artists and intellectuals. In collaboration with other organizations and academic literary departments, they have created courses, seminars, and debates about Afro-Brazilian literature and questions of race in literature. Since 1999 the group is coordinated by Esmeralda Ribeiro and Márcio Barbosa.
Late 20th/early 21st century.
Paulo Lins.
Best known for his novel "Cidade de Deus"City of God, Paulo Lins currently teaches at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. "Cidade de Deus" was the result of eight years of ethnographic fieldwork that Lins conducted in the favela of the same name and where he grew up as a child. Lins is currently working on a book that deals with slavery in Brazil since the 15th century.
Ferréz and Literatura Marginal (Marginal Literature).
Literatura Marginal was another Afro-Brazilian literary group founded by a group of writers and artists from the São Paulo favela of Capão Redondo in 2005. This literary group has a strong relationship with the hip-hop culture of São Paulo with writers crossing over into the production of rap, and rap artists crossing over into the field of literary production. One of the leaders of Literatura Marginal, Ferrez, is considered to be the most published and best known writer of this group. His first publication came in 1997 with a collection of poetry entitled "Fortaleza da Desilusão" (Fortress of Disillusion). He then published two novels: "Capão Pecado" and "O Manual Pratico do Odio" (The Practical Manual of Hate). His writings have a prominent aesthetic of gratuitous violence and sex that conveys life in the urban periphery. The use of slang and Afro-Brazilian cultural and historical allusions is commonly found throughout his novels as well.
Afro-Brazilian literary studies and criticism.
In recent years, Afro-Latino Studies has gained attention in U.S., Latin-American, European and African universities. Within this broad field of study, Afro-Brazilian Literary & Cultural Studies has also gained traction in National Literature, Anthropology, History, and other academic departments. Several notable books include "The Afro-Brazilian Mind: Contemporary Afro-Brazilian Literary and Cultural Criticism", edited by Niyi Afolabi (Assistant Professor, Department of Spanish & Portuguese, University of Texas at Austin), that brings together writers, academics, and intellectuals from the U.S. and Brazil to focus on the genre of Afro-Brazilian literature and culture. Another important book is "Writing Identity: The Politics of Afro-Brazilian Literature" by Emanuelle Oliveira (Associate Professor, Department of Spanish & Portuguese, Vanderbilt University) uses Pierre Bourdieu's theory of culture production to analyze Quilombhoje's literary and cultural production as Afro-Brazilians. "Black Brazil: Culture, Identity, and Social Mobilization", edited by Randal Johnson and Larry Crook, is a collection of essays that focus on Afro-Brazilians through the fields of anthropology, history, sociology, literary studies, religious studies, and performance studies.

Interlac (APA)

Interlac is a bimonthly amateur press association devoted to the DC Comics science fiction superhero team the Legion of Super-Heroes. It was the first APA devoted to the Legion and, despite the decline of APAs due to Internet forums, continues to operate to this day.
Interlac’s name comes from the designated communication language of the 30th-century United Planets confederation (the milieu in which the Legion of Super-Heroes operates).
History.
Rich Morrissey founded the APA in June 1976, calling it LEAPA (the LEgion Amateur Press Association); it changed its name to Interlac three mailings later. There were 15 founding members, and the first mailing was 26 pages.
At the time, there were few general-interest comics APAs, CAPA-alpha and APA-5 being the exceptions. But never before in comic book fandom had the fans of a single comic book come together in a single APA. So while Interlac’s form came from CAPA-alpha, its membership came from the Legion Fan Club (started by 13-year-old Mike Flynn in 1972) and "The Legion Outpost" (a fanzine started in 1972). 
In 1976, the Legion of Super-Heroes’ comic was finally on a solid footing, with the rich Legion mythos giving members plenty to discuss. As the roster grew—soon reaching its 50-member limit—it became clear that the APA had become a true community. Members met each other at comic book conventions and became real-life friends; members Tom Bierbaum and Mary Gilmore met through the APA, began a romance, and eventually married. Even more notably, the Bierbaums later graduated from Interlac to working as scripters of the Legion comic itself.
The roster, with the exception of a few stalwarts, has turned over repeatedly, breathing fresh life and bringing new points of view into the forum. All the same, in 2000, eight of the 15 founders were still on the roster, waiting list, or honorary membership list, and four of the original 15 had remained on the roster continuously.
At one point, a spinoff APA devoted to music was formed, dubbed "Quarternotes" by its founders.
Policies.
Interlac membership is limited to 50 roster slots. Minimum activity requirement is four collated and stapled pages in any three consecutive mailings. Applicants for membership send the Leader $10.00 to join the waitlist. A new waitlister receives a copy of the most recently available mailing and thereafter a Bulletin until becoming a member. Waitlisters are encouraged to submit contributions from the waitlist; for doing so, they’ll be eligible to purchase a copy of the mailing the contribution appears in. Any waitlister, having contributed at least ten pages, may be granted an extension of their invited period at the Leader’s discretion.
Honorary memberships have been awarded to former members of at least three years whose presence “significantly enriched Interlac and furthered its goals.” No more than one person per year may be awarded an honorary membership.
Divided evenly among the members, except the Leader(s) (to a maximum of two individuals at a time), who is exempt. Mailings for sale are available to members and waitlisters.
The Leader is elected by the majority of the voting membership to a one-year term. The Leader is responsible for distributing mailings, appointing a Deputy to serve in case of absence, setting deadlines, presenting a complete statement of the APA’s finances in each mailing’s Bulletin and interpreting the Constitution. The Leader is responsible for setting the copy count within a limit of 60.

Laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy

Photoemission spectroscopy is a very powerful and sensitive experimental technique to study surface physics. It is based on the photoelectric effect originally observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 and later explained by Albert Einstein in 1905 that when a material is shone by light, the electrons can absorb photons and escape from the material with the kinetic energy: formula_1, where formula_2 is the incident photon energy, formula_3 the work function of the material. Since the kinetic energy of ejected electrons are highly associated with the internal electronic structure, by analyzing the photoelectron spectroscopy one can realize the fundamental physical and chemical properties of the material, such as the type and arrangement of local bonding, electronic structure and chemical composition. 
In addition, because electrons with different momentum will escape from the sample in different directions, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is widely used to provide the dispersive energy-momentum spectrum. The state-of-the-art modern photoemission experiment is conducted using synchrotron radiation light source with typical photon energy of 20 – 100 eV. Synchrotron light is ideal for investigating two-dimensional surface systems and offers unparalleled flexibility to continuously vary the incident photon energy. However, due to the high costs to construct and maintain this accelerator, high competition for beam time, as well as the universal minimum electron mean free path in the material around the operating photon energy (20–100 eV) which leads to the fundamental hindrance to the three-dimensional bulk materials sensitivity, an alternative photon source for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is desirable.
Laser-based ARPES.
Background.
The table-top laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy had been developed by some research groups. Daniel Dessau of University of Colorado, Boulder, made the first demonstration and applied this technique to explore superconducting system. The achievement not only greatly reduces the costs and size of facility, but also, most importantly, provides the unprecedented higher bulk sensitivity due to the low photon energy, typically 6 eV, and consequently the longer photoelectron mean free path (2–7 nm) in the sample. This advantage is extremely beneficial and powerful for the study of strongly correlated materials and high-Tc superconductors in which the physics of photoelectrons from the topmost layers might be different from the bulk. 
In addition to about one-order-of-magnitude improvement in the bulk sensitivity, the advance in the momentum resolution is also very significant: the photoelectrons will be more broadly dispersed in emission angle when the energy of incident photon decreases. In other words, for a given angular resolution of the electron spectrometer, the lower photon energy leads to higher momentum resolution. The typical momentum resolution of a 6 eV laser-based ARPES is approximately 8 times better than that of a 50 eV synchrotron radiation ARPES. Besides, the better momentum resolution due to low photon energy also results in less k-space accessible to ARPES which is helpful to the more precise spectrum analysis. For instance, in the 50 eV synchrotron ARPES, electrons from the first 4 Brillouin zones will be excited and scattered to contribute to the background of photoelectron analysis. However, the small momentum of 6 eV ARPES will only access some part of the first Brillouin zone and therefore only those electrons from small region of k-space can be ejected and detected as the background. The reduced inelastic scattering background is desirable while doing the measurement of weak physical quantities, in particular the high-Tc superconductors. 
Experimental realization.
The schematic diagram of the first 6 eV laser-based ARPES system is shown in Fig. 1. A Kerr mode-locked Ti: sapphire oscillator is used and pumped with another frequency doubled Nd: Vanadate laser of 5 W and then generates 70 fs and 6 nJ pulses which are tunable around 840 nm (1.5 eV) with the 1 MHz repetition rate. Two stages of non-linear second harmonic generation of light are carried out through type Ι phase matching in β-barium borate and then the quadruple light with 210 nm (~ 6 eV) is generated and finally focused and directed into the ultra-high vacuum chamber as the low-energy photon source to investigate the electronic structure of the sample.
In the first demonstration, Dessau’s group showed that the typical forth harmonic spectrum fits very well with the Gaussian profile with a full width at half maximum of 4.7 meV as well as presents a 200 μW power. The excellent performance of high flux (~ 1014- 1015 photons/s) and narrow bandwidth makes the laser-based ARPES overwhelm the synchrotron radiation ARPES even though the best undulator beamlines are used. Another noticeable point is that one can make the quadruple light pass through either 1/4 wave plate or 1/2 wave plate which produces the circular polarization or any linear polarization light in the ARPES. Because the polarization of light can influence the signal to background ratio, the ability to control the polarization of light is a very significant improvement and advantage over the synchrotron ARPES. With the aforementioned favorable features, including lower costs for operating and maintenance, better energy and momentum resolution, and higher flux and ease of polarization control of photon source, the laser-based ARPES undoubtedly is an ideal candidate to be employed to conduct more sophisticated experiments in condensed matter physics.
Applications.
High-Tc superconductor.
One way to show the powerful ability of laser-based ARPES is to study high Tc superconductors. Fig. 2 shows the experimental dispersion relation, binding energy vs. momentum, of the superconducting Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d along the nodal direction of the Brillouin zone. Fig. 2 (b) and Fig. 2 (c) are taken by the synchrotron light source of 28 eV and 52 eV, respectively, with the best undulator beamlines. The significantly sharper spectral peaks, the evidence of quasiparticles in the cuprate superconductor, by the powerful laser-based ARPES are shown in Fig. 2 (a). This is the first comparison of dispersive energy-momentum relation at low photon energy from table-top laser with higher energy from synchrotron ARPES. The much clearer dispersion in (a) indicates the improved energy-momentum resolution as well as many important physical features, such as overall band dispersion, Fermi surface, superconducting gaps, and a kink by electron-boson coupling, are successfully reproduced. It is foreseeable that in the near future the laser-based ARPES will be widely used to help condensed matter physicists get more detailed information about the nature of superconductivity in the exotic materials as well as other novel properties that cannot be observed by the state-of-the-art conventional experimental techniques.
Time-resolved electron dynamics.
The femtosecond laser-based ARPES is also potential to be employed to explore the time-resolved electron dynamics by the pump-probe experiment which is very commonly used in the optical researches. In principle, by pumping an electron to a higher level excited state with the first photon, the subsequent evolution and interactions of electronic states as a function of time can be studied by the second probing photon. The traditional pump-probe experiments usually measure the changes of some optical constants, which might be too complex to obtain the relevant physics. Since the ARPES can provide a lot of detailed information about the electronic structures and interactions, the pump-probe laser-based ARPES may study more complicated electronic systems with sub-picosecond resolution.
Summary and perspective.
Even though the angle-resolved synchrotron radiation source is widely used to investigate the surface dispersive energy-momentum spectrum, the laser-based ARPES can even provide more detailed and bulk-sensitive electronic structures with much better energy and momentum resolution, which are critically necessary for studying the strongly correlated electronic system, high-Tc superconductor, and phase transition in exotic quantum system. In addition, the lower costs for operating and higher photon flux make laser-based ARPES easier to be handled and more versatile and powerful among other modern experimental techniques for surface science.
It is foreseeable that the laser-based ARPES may even extend the field of traditional ARPES up to the study of other exotic nanomaterials, such as nanowires and colossal magnetoresistent materials.

David L. Robbins (Virginia writer)

David L. Robbins (born 1954) is an American author of several historical fiction novels, and founder of the James River Writers and the Richmond-based Podium Foundation. 
Biography.
The son of World War II veterans, David Lea Robbins was born on March 10, 1954, in Richmond, VA. He received his B.A. in Theater and Speech from the College of William and Mary in 1976, then his Juris Doctorate from the same school four years later. 
He spent one year practicing environmental law in South Carolina to keep an agreement made with his father regarding the money spent on law school. When that time was up, he turned to freelance writing. He did not devote his time to writing fiction until 1990. After the sweeping success of "War of the Rats" and his subsequent novels, Robbins was able to become a full-time novelist.
In 2007, Robbins returned to his alma mater, this time as the Writer in Residence. He was so popular among the students that they petitioned for him to return an extra semester before passing the torch to Tom De Haven, author of "Funny Papers" and "It's Superman!".
Robbins co-founded along with several other writers the James River Writers in 2002 to encourage creative expression in the Richmond area. Since its founding, the nonprofit organization holds literary and art contests, newsletters, and a yearly conference, as well as exposing readers to contemporary authors who come to speak. 
After the success of the James River Writers, Robbins was appalled by the lack of creative encouragement given to lower-class students in the Richmond area. In 2008, he started the Podium Foundation, creating a literary magazine and public voice to these students who aspire to rise above societal expectations. Currently, Podium has published its second volume of student submissions and reaching out to middle and high schools beyond Richmond.
The organization has also branched out to include several more programs, including a writing academy for city high school teachers and a monthly article written by city high school students published in the Richmond Times Dispatch. 
In addition to writing novels, Robbins is an avid sailor and sportsman. He studies classical guitar. When not traveling to research his novels, he lives in his hometown of Richmond, VA. He is currently at work on his tenth novel, an adventure tale of Somali pirates and international intrigue, influenced by Mary Shelley, to be called The Devil's Waters.
Novels.
Robbin’s first book, "Souls to Keep" (pub. 1998 by Harper Collins), attracted little attention. His breakthrough came in 1999 with the publication of "War of the Rats", a thrilling recounting of the Russian and German sniper duels over the city of Stalingrad. Adding meticulously researched details and vibrant human depth to the historical records of World War II, the novel won Robbins recognition and praise.
Robbins followed up "War of the Rats" with "The End of War", another World War II-era tale of the approach of the Allied forces and the fall of Berlin, this time adding civilian perspectives to his narrative. His fourth novel, "Scorched Earth", addressed contemporary racism in the American South. Robbins returned to World War II with "Last Citadel", bringing Cossack traditions and partisan warfare to life for the tank battle of Kursk in August 1943. "Liberation Road" deals with the experience of black and Jewish minorities in the U.S. Army during the war.
Branching from historical fiction into alternate history, "The Assassin’s Gallery" features the assassination of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is the first of Robbins’ novels to have a direct sequel, "The Betrayal Game", in which an American teacher visiting Havana is embroiled in a conspiracy to assassinate Fidel Castro before the Bay of Pigs invasion.
His most recent novel, "Broken Jewel", was released on November 10, 2009 by Simon and Schuster. In this novel, Robbins explores the Pacific Theater and the atrocities committed upon the so-called “comfort women” enslaved by the Japanese military.

Pepper Young's Family

"Pepper Young's Family" was one of radio's more popular daytime drama series, with various format and title changes during its long run from 1932 to 1959. It was created and written by short story author and playwright Elaine Sterne Carrington.
With Burgess Meredith in the title role, the program began as Red Adams, about high school athlete Red Adams, his family and friends. The 30-minute series was broadcast on the Blue Network, airing on Sunday nights at 10:30pm. When Beech-Nut Gum signed as a sponsor, they wanted no mention of their competition, Adams gum, so the title changed to Red Davis, a 15-minute series heard three times a week from 1933 to 1935. The series was again retitled, and the 15-minute Forever Young was heard on NBC weekdays at 3pm from January 13 to June 26, 1936. Three days later, on June 29, it became "Pepper Young's Family", continuing on NBC for the next 23 years with Procter & Gamble's Camay as the sponsor.
In the storyline, high school athlete Larry "Pepper" Young (Curtis Arnall, Lawson Zerbe, Mason Adams) and his sister Peggy (Elizabeth Wragge) lived in the small town of Elmwood where their father, Sam Young (Jack Roseleigh, Bill Adams, Thomas Chalmers) ran a manufacturing company. Pepper's girl friend was Linda Benton (Eunice Howard), and his buddy was Nick Havens (John Kane). Leaving school, Pepper took a job as a reporter with the local "Free Press". When Pepper and Linda (played by Margaret Draper) married, they had a child, Button. Sam Young became Elmwood's mayor. Oil was discovered on the farm where Pepper and Linda lived, but a fire at the oil well spread, burning down much of the town.
Others in the cast were Grace Albert, Marion Barney (as Pepper's mother), Alan Bunce, Michael Fitzmaurice, Stacy Harris, Claire Howard, Madge Kennedy, Greta Kvalden, Cecil Roy, Laddie Seaman, Jean Sothern, Arthur Vinton, Edwin Wolfe (who also directed some shows).
Announcers included Martin Block, Alan Kent and Richard Stark. The opening piano theme was "Au Matin".
Carrington continued to script the program until her death in 1958. She also wrote scripts for two other daytime dramas, "When a Girl Marries" and "Rosemary".
In 1964, NANA Radio began production of newly written episodes of "Pepper Young's Family". At least 88 of these revival episodes are in circulation today.

Whirlpool Corp. v. Camco Inc.

Whirlpool Corp. v. Camco Inc., 2 S.C.R. 1067; 2000 SCC 67, is a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on patents, namely claim construction and double patenting, whether a patent should be invalid because an invention was patented twice. The court adopted purposive construction as the means to construe patent claims. This judgement is to be read along with the related decision, "Free World Trust v. Électro Santé Inc.", [2000 2 S.C.R. 1066, 2000 SCC 66. There the Court articulated the scope of protection provided by patents.
Background.
Law.
In Canada the patent system prohibits two patents for the same invention. This is called double patenting. One type of double patenting is to compare the claims of the patents. Are they identical or conterminous? This is sometimes called “same invention” double patenting. There is a second type ofdouble patenting is sometimes called “obviousness” double patenting. Prior to this case it was unclear how to handle “obviousness” double patenting.
Facts.
In the 1970s Whirlpool developed an inventive dual action agitator for clothes washing machines that utilized the bottom portion of the shaft for the usual oscillating motion back and forth but added an upper sleeve that was designed to work as an auger. The auger propelled water and clothing downwards onto the oscillating vanes of the lower agitator to produce more uniform scrubbing. This development work resulted in three Canadian patents. In the first patent (1,045,401) the dual agitator was powered by a drive shaft that was not at issue. A 
CIPO - Patent - 1,049,803 : The second patent. (“'803 patent”) substituted a clutch mechanism for the drive shaft. The trial judge concluded that both of the first and second patent required that the vanes on the lower agitator be rigid. Under a 
CIPO - Patent - 1,095,734 : The third patent (“'734 patent”) flexible vanes were substituted for rigid vanes. The trial judge held the '734 patent to be valid and infringed. This was appealled and dismissed and then further appealled. At the Supreme Court double patenting and claim construction were the issues.

Nao Takasugi

Nao Takasugi (April 5, 1922–November 19, 2009) was an American politician from California, a member of the Republican Party, and a survivor of the Japanese American internment camps.
Early life.
Born and raised in Oxnard, California, Takasugi worked in the family's grocery store, the Asahi Market, before he enrolled at UCLA. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he was pulled out of the university at the age of 19 and placed in an internment camp in Gila River, Arizona. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered all Japanese Americans placed in internment camps. In 1943, Takasugi was one of 4,000 students released from the internment camps to continue college on the East Coast. He earned his bachelor's degree from Temple University and his MBA from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946.
After graduating from the Ivy League school in 1946, he returned to Oxnard to work in his family's Asahi Market. The Takasugi family had opened the store in 1907 and had left it in the custody of employee Ignacio Carmona when they were forced to enter the internment camp. Upon the Takasugis' return from the internment camp, Carmona returned control of the store to the Takasugis.
In 1952, Takasugi married his wife, Judy, with whom he had five children, Scott, Russell, Ron, Tricia and Lea.
Public service.
After the City of Oxnard turned down his efforts to get a new sign for his family's market, Takasugi felt the city needed someone with a head for business to cut through the bureaucracy and decided to run for the City Council and won a four-year term in his first election in 1976. He was reelected to the council in 1980 and then was elected Mayor of Oxnard in 1982. Takasugi won re-election as Mayor four more times before winning election to the Assembly.
Takasugi won election to the California State Assembly in 1992, then becoming the only Asian American in the legislature at that time. A moderate, he succeeded conservative icon Tom McClintock in the Ventura County based 37th district (formerly the 36th). He won easy reelection in 1994 and 1996 but term limits prevented him from running again in 1998.
In the year 2000 Takasugi ran for a seat on the board of the Oxnard Harbor District and won. He remained in the position until retiring in 2008.
Later life.
In his final year in the Assembly at the age of 76, Takasugi suffered a heart attack while jogging outside his Sacramento apartment near the California State Capitol. 
The Takasugi Family was featured in the book "The Greatest Generation" by Tom Brokaw. During his interview with Browkay Nao Takasugi said "I find that I am compelled to remember the best– not the worst–of that time. To focus not on the grave deprivation of rights which beset us all, but rather on the countless shining moments of virtue that emerged from the shadows of that dark hour"
At the age of 87, Takasugi died of complications from a stroke on November 19, 2009, at 8:20 P.M. at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. His is survived by wife of 57 years, Judy, his sisters Chiyeko Sakamoto, Hisaye Takasugi and Shika Akiyoshi, his five children, Scott, Russell, Ron, Tricia and Lea, as well as his grandchildren, Ryan, Lara, Jessica, Raquel, Mckennah, Taylor, and Dane.

Lee Wilder Thomas

Lee Wilder Thomas, known as Rev. L.W. Thomas (August 15, 1873 - April 11, 1953), was a prominent African-American business and oil man. L.W. Thomas was among the lucky land owners in the Mexia, Texas, oil field. In the early 1930s, he partnered with Jake Simmons, Jr., another wealthy African-American oil broker. Together, these two men built Simmons Royalty Co., one of the leading African-American oil and mineral right royalty companies in the state of Oklahoma.
Early life.
Born in Springfield or Tehuacana, Limestone County, Texas, L.W. was the only child born to
Boss Thomas and Bettie Arbuckle. His father, Boss Thomas, was an early Alabaman who migrated and re-settled in Texas.
As a young boy, while attending the Sardis Primitive Baptist Church, Mexia, Limestone County, Texas, he felt a calling to preach the gospel. He received his early education in Mexia, and would later attend and graduate college from Wiley College in Marshall, Texas. After graduating college L.W. married Clemmie Estella Ross in 1895. This union would produce thirteen children.
Oil business.
In 1912 a large natural gas deposit was discovered by the Mexia Gas and Oil Company. Oil was discovered in 1920. L.W. Thomas was among the lucky land owners in the 1920 Mexia oilfield strike. He had ten producing oil wells on his property.
The excitement of booming fields in three counties fostered crime and social problems that forced Governor Pat Morris Neff, on January 12, 1922, to order martial law for Justice Precinct No. 4 in Limestone County and No. 5 in Freestone County to deal with robberies, gambling, and alcohol sales. But the boom rolled on, and at the end of 1922 the fields showed a markedly increased combined yearly yield of nearly 34.8 million barrels of oil.
Summit, Oklahoma.
L.W. Thomas came to Oklahoma with a vision of establishing a model community, Summit, for African-Americans, located on the Jefferson Highway (U.S. 69), southwest of Muskogee. He invested more than $100,000 in Muskogee County real estate. He divided the site into lots and put them up for sale, as well as surrounding property which he divided into small farms. He said the land was to be sold to African-Americans with preference being given to those from Texas.
He had already erected a building housing a general store and another as a real estate office. A cotton gin was under construction, and workmen were working around the clock to have it finished for the fall crop. He had built a $12,000 house on a nearby hill and was reserving adjoining lots for additional better class homes.
In addition to growing cotton and peanuts, he was going to encourage the growing of vegetables for the Muskogee and Tulsa market. The 1932 Muskogee City Directory indicated that L.W. Thomas was president of the Jake Simmons, Jr., Simmons Royalty Co.
St. Thomas Primitive Baptist Church.
St. Thomas Primitive Baptist Church is a historic church building in Summit. It was erected in 1922 by the Rev. L.W. Thomas. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

RealityEngine

RealityEngine refers to a 3D graphics hardware architecture and a family of graphics systems that implemented the aforementioned hardware architecture that was developed and manufactured by Silicon Graphics during the early to mid 1990s. The RealityEngine was positioned as Silicon Graphics' high-end visualization hardware for their MIPS/IRIX platform and was used exclusively in their Crimson and Onyx family of visualization systems, which are sometimes referred to as "graphics supercomputers" or "visualization supercomputers". The RealityEngine was marketed to and used by large organizations such as companies and universities that are involved in computer simulation, digital content creation, engineering and research.
It was succeeded by the InfiniteReality in early 1996, but coexisted with it for a time as an entry-level option for older systems.
RealityEngine.
The RealityEngine was a board set comprising a Geometry Engine board, one to four Raster Memory board(s), and a DG2 Display Generator board. These boards plugged into a midplane on the host system.
The Geometry Engine was based around the 50 MHz Intel i860XP.
VTX.
The VTX was a cost-reduced RealityEngine and as a consequence, its features and performance was below that of the RealityEngine. It should not be mistaken as the VGX or VGXT board set.
RealityEngine2.
The RealityEngine2, branded RealityEngine2, is an upgraded RealityEngine with twelve instead of eight Geometry Engines introduced towards the end of the RealityEngine's life. It was succeeded by the InfiniteReality in early 1996.
It uses the GE10 Geometry Engine board, RM4 Raster Memory board and DG2 Display Generator board.

Graperide

The Graperide is a cycle race held annually around Blenheim, New Zealand. First run in 2005, past winners of the race include Robin Reid and Anthony Chapman. The number of participants attempting to enter the Grape Ride has increased each year - due to the logistics of controlling such a large number of riders, the number of riders in the event was capped in 2007 and 2008.
History.
The Graperide was first run in 2005, attracting 699 entries (both individuals and teams were counted as a single entry). The majority of entrants rode a 101 km course, though riders who had survived cancer were entitled to ride a special 15 km loop instead. Individual entries were split up into age categories.
In 2006, various categories were added to the race. Firstly, the 101 km ride was split into two sections - an 'Elite' category, for those wishing to race for the winner's prizes on offer, and an 'Individual' category, for those wanting to ride the 101 km course but not wanting to race against the top competitive cyclists. A section was added for tandems, who rode the full 101 km course, and for penny farthings, who rode the shortened 15 km course. The category for cancer sufferers remained, and a total of 1540 entries were received.
2007 saw additional changes. The 'Elite' categories were rebranded as the 'Speed Bunnies' categories, and the distance for the male 'Speed Bunnies' was increased to 160 km. Also, a new category was introduced known as the 'Magnum'. This involved riding the 101 km course twice, for a total of 202 km. There were a total of 2,267 entries in 2007, with the total number of persons riding capped at 2500.
2008 brought some more changes for the Grape Ride. A special category was set up for survivors of cancer that wanted to ride the full 101 km course, and a new category was set up for riders who wished to ride the 15 km course on a unicycle. A 'Shop Team' category was set up, whereby teams of three representing a business were timed based on the time of their slowest rider. A section was set up for people riding 'old clangers' - bikes that were made at least 50 years ago.
Organisers have announced that 2009 will bring additional categories - an "Ultimate" category, covering 10 laps for a total distance of 1010 km, and a section for college / high school students is under consideration.
Course.
The Graperide is based around the Forrest Estate winery. After lining up inside the winery's driveway, participants are released in groups of approximately 100 riders, based on the individual's estimated finishing time. After leaving the winery, riders head south briefly before curving left. Riders pass through Renwick and eventually come into the outskirts of Blenheim, before turning left onto Grove Road. Riders then head north, passing such towns as Grovetown and Spring Creek before reaching Picton. Riders take a left in Picton, travelling into Queen Charlotte Drive. This road is known for its beautiful scenery, though its rolling terrain is some of the most difficult of the circuit. After travelling through the undulating drive, riders pass through The Grove, eventually climbing the 3.4 km long Mahakipawa Hill before descending into Havelock. From there, riders head south until they reach the Forrest Estate winery again. Magnum riders do two laps of the course, while male 'Speed Bunnies' start at Picton, and do one part lap and one full lap.
The smaller 15 km course for cancer riders and unicyclists follows a loop around Renwick.

Treaty of Stettin (1653)

The Treaty of Stettin () of 4 May 1653 settled a dispute between Brandenburg and Sweden, who both claimed succession in the Duchy of Pomerania after the extinction of the local House of Pomerania during the Thirty Years' War. Brandenburg's claims were based on the Treaty of Grimnitz (1529), while Sweden's claims were based on the Treaty of Stettin (1630). The parties had agreed on a partition of the Swedish-held duchy in the Peace of Westphalia (1648), and with the Treaty of Stettin determined the actual border between the partitions. Western Pomerania became Swedish Pomerania, Farther Pomerania became Brandenburgian Pomerania.
Background.
During the war, Sweden had occupied the Duchy of Pomerania in 1630. The last Griffin duke Bogislaw XIV died in 1637, his duchy was supposed to be inherited by Brandenburg, who based her claims on in the Treaty of Grimnitz. 
This however was hindered by the Swedish presence. The 1648 Peace of Westphalia ended the war, and Pomerania was to be partitioned between Brandenburg and Sweden. The 1650 Treaty of Nuremberg roughly defined the areas that should be under control of Sweden and Brandenburg, respectively.
The treaty.
The precise border was drawn in the 1653 Treaty of Stettin, partitioning the Duchy of Pomerania along a line running east of the Oder river. The areas west of this line (Vorpommern, including Stettin) stayed with Sweden and hence were referred to as Swedish Pomerania. The areas east of the line (Farther Pomerania) were to be transferred to Brandenburg. Half of the customs revenues of the Farther Pomeranian towns were the prerogative of Sweden even after her withdrawal.
The border was determined to run north from the Brandenburg-Pomeranian border, leaving Komturei Greifenhagen and Komturei Wildenbruch with Sweden, to run towards Woltiner See between Wierow and Schönfeld, from there run north between Damerow and Greifenhagen, Klebow and Brünken, Hökendorf and Buchholz, then meet the Plöne river, from there run through the Friedrichswalde forest, cross the Ihna, circumvent Gollnow and Hohenbrück (with Sweden), meet the Martinscher See, circumvent Kammin, Tribsow and Fritzow (with Sweden) and meet the Baltic Sea between Raddack and Lüchentin.
On 19 July 1653, the first Landtag in Brandenburgian Pomerania assembled in Stargard. In 1654, the Swedish withdrawal from Farther Pomerania was complete.
Notability in European context.
The treaty consolidated Sweden's control of the Oder estituary, adding to Sweden's gain of control at the lower Weser and Elbe rivers from the Peace of Westphalia. Thus, the treaty consolidated Sweden's control over the mouths of all major German rivers, except for the Rhine. Swedish Pomerania became the largest territorial foothold of Pomerania in Germany.
Border revisions of 1679 and 1720.
The border as agreed on in the treaty was slightly shifted westwards after the Scanian War in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679), and shifted far west to the Peene and Peenestrom rivers after the Great Northern War in the Treaty of Stockholm (1720).

Roger Williams University in Nashville, Tennessee was an historically black college. It was created in 1866 as one of numerous schools established in the South by the American Baptist denomination, and became the largest Baptist college in the area for educating African Americans. Protestant mission groups sponsored new educational facilities for the freedmen. The college was named for Roger Williams, the founder to the First Baptist Church in America. Daniel W. Phillips, a white minister and freedmen's missionary from Massachusetts, taught the first classes. It helped educate numerous African-American teachers and other leaders in the South throughout the 19th century, including William Madison McDonald, who became an influential Republican politician in Texas.

Low Dinsdale Manor

Low Dinsdale Manor is a privately owned, much altered, and extended medieval manor house situated on the north bank of the River Tees at Low Dinsdale, near Darlington, County Durham, England. It is a Grade II* listed building.
The manor was owned by the Surtees family from the 12th century. Several members of the Surtees of Dinsdale family served as High Sheriff of Northumberland. In 1511 on the death of the last male of the family it passed to his daughter Katherine Place. Rowland Place was High Sheriff of Durham in 1654. The house was the birthplace of his son artist Francis Place (1647–1728). In 1718 the manor was sold to Cuthbert Routh and in 1770 to John Lambton of Lambton. In 1789 a mineral spring was discovered on the estate and a Spa was established. Lambton's son John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham built Dinsdale Spa Hotel in 1829.
In 1844 the Earl sold the manor to Henry George Surtees (High Sheriff of Durham 1862) a descendant of the ancient family. He substantially extended and altered the house in 1876 adding new bays to the medieval core and two cross-gabled wings.
In 1914 the manor was sold to Sir Henry Havelock-Allan Bt.
A large part of the estate was sold for the creation of a golf course.

John Carmichael (composer)

John Carmichael OAM (born 5 October 1930) is an Australian pianist, composer and music therapist who has long been resident in the United Kingdom. One of his best known works is the "Concierto folklorico" for piano and string orchestra. His works for piano form much of his musical output, although he composes for many other instruments. His work is described as expressive and lyrical.
Biography.
John Carmichael was born in Melbourne in 1930. He studied piano with Margaret Schofield and in 1947 won a scholarship to the Melbourne Conservatorium, where his teacher was Raymond Lambert. He also studied composition with Dorian Le Gallienne. Moving to Europe, he studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Marcel Ciampi and in London with Arthur Benjamin and Anthony Milner, a pupil of Mátyás Seiber. He wrote the music for Britain's Festival of Women during this period. He also wrote reviews and critiques for music magazines.
John Carmichael was a pioneer in the field of music therapy; he developed music teaching and music appreciation projects at Stoke Mandeville Hospital and Netherden Mental Hospital in Surrey, and worked for the Council for Music Therapy in London.
Between 1958 and 1963, he was Music Director of the Spanish dance company "Eduardo Y Navarra", during which time he became fascinated by Spanish folk idiom. He toured internationally with the group, including an Australian visit. From this came the "Concierto Folklorico" for piano and string orchestra. John Carmichael has twice recorded this work with himself as soloist, both times with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra (1970, conducted by Tibor Paul; 1984, conducted by David Measham). 
In 1980, his "Phoenix" Flute Concerto was premiered at the Sydney Opera House with James Galway as soloist and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under Louis Frémaux. Galway also played in the U.S. premiere the same year, at the Hollywood Bowl by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Michael Tilson Thomas.
In 1984, he appeared as soloist in a performance of his piano concerto on the "Last Night of the Proms" during the 10th Perth International Arts Festival.
Writing for the piano has always stimulated ideas for compositions has led to collaborations with Australian pianists such as Victor Sangiorgio, Antony Gray and also with Carles & Sofia piano duo, who have recorded Carmichael’s complete works for piano four hands for the label KNS-classical. 
Honours.
In the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 2011, John Carmichael was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for his services as a composer and concert pianist.
