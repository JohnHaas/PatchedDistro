The Mystery of the Yeti

The Mystery of the Yeti is a Goa trance concept album conceived and arranged by Ron Rothfield (a.k.a. Raja Ram). It was collaboratively produced by Raja Ram and Graham Wood of The Infinity Project; Stéphane Holweck, Loïc Van Poucke, and Serge Souque (the founding members of Total Eclipse); and Simon Posford (aka Hallucinogen).
"The Mystery of the Yeti" was an early and influential concept album in psychedelic trance music. Three years after recording it, all the "Mystery of the Yeti" artists, except for Graham Wood, collaborated on a follow-up album: "The Mystery of the Yeti, Part 2" (1999).
In 2004, Raja Ram's record label TIP.World Records re-released "The Mystery of the Yeti" and The Infinity Project's "Mystical Experiences" (1995) as a double album.
Imagery and themes.
Narrative.
"The Mystery of the Yeti" is the musical score to a short story written by Raja Ram and trance DJ Chicago (both of whom were later among the members of 1200 Micrograms). The story, called "Who or What Is the 'Yeti'?", is printed in the liner notes of the album. Each of the album's four tracks conveys a part of the story.
Summary of "Who or What Is the 'Yeti'?".
In twelve Himalayan villages, twelve "elder mystics" each dream that there is a connection between the yeti and extraterrestrial life. With visions to guide them, the elders lead 2000 people from their upland villages higher into the mountains by starlight. At dawn, they sound bejeweled "dungchen" (long trumpets) to accompany the chants of "om" by the monks who remain in the villages below. When the echoes recede, the elders sound a gong and merrily continue their journey.
The travelers make music as they go. They cross a swiftly-flowing river in canoes, and pass through "the tunnel of Dead Spirits", where they hear strange voices and other curious sounds. After braving a fierce thunderstorm, they smoke a sacrament, resume their rhythmic music-making, and enter a trance. The music has a mysterious effect on them. The crowd of 2000 simultaneously shouts in joy. Carrying torches, they arrange themselves into a giant mandala.
Their focused attention summons a shaman who levitates above them. The shaman, radiating multicolored light, performs an ecstatic dance. Beams and discs of light pass through the people, who suddenly understand the yeti. The light fills their minds with poetry and music. Spontaneously, they awaken to the cosmic consciousness. The shaman shows them the yeti, who is a wise and compassionate extraterrestrial being. The yeti's form changes to an elaborate geometric pattern, and merges with the shaman. In a flash they disappear, replaced with a vessel that can travel through other dimensions of cosmic consciousness.
Album art.
The album cover illustrates a scene from the climax of the story "Who or What Is the 'Yeti'?", and uses various interconnected symbols concerning Shiva, the chakras, and the mind. The paintings are by visionary artists Brahma Templeman and Lahiri. The computer graphics were designed by Barnaby Gorton.
On the album cover, a yeti hovers in the lotus position. Glowing emblems in front of his body represent five of the chakra (centers of vital energy): The root chakra, the sacral chakra, the solar plexus chakra, the heart chakra, and the brow chakra (or third eye). His multicolored hair suggests activation of the crown chakra, which symbolizes the higher consciousness that comes with freedom from illusion, or "maya".
In his right hand he holds a lingam, a stone symbol of Shiva; in his left is a trishula, a symbolic trident with numerous meanings. It represents Shiva's power over the "three worlds" (trailokya), the "three times", and the "three evils". Shiva wields the trishula to destroy trailokya, replacing it with satcitananda, the blissful experience of the universal mind. This triumph occurs in a person's own bodymind through great attainment.
Insofar as it pertains to the human body, the trishula refers to the brow chakra as the junction of the three main nāḍi (subtle energy channels). The center prong extends higher because it represents "shushmana", an energy channel that continues to the crown chakra. In the album's title, the letter "Y" in "Yeti" is actually the Greek capital letter "psi" (Ψ), which resembles a trishula.
The symbol on the monolithic lingam at the base of the mountain is a tripundra, a mark warn on the forehead to indicate a belief that Shiva is the Ishvara, or Supreme Being. The three horizontal lines represent the soul's three bonds: maya, karma, and anava. The lines are drawn with a paste mixed from water and vibhuti (consecrated ash from burnt cow dung), as a reminder that merging with the divine is urgent since the physical body is impermanent. The dot in the center is a bindu. When placed on the forehead, it indicates the third eye. It also symbolizes the unmanifest, from which the cosmos emerges, as well as the point at which the many becomes one.

Regent master

Regent master ("Magister regens") was a title conferred in the medieval universities upon a student who had acquired a master's degree. The degree meant simply the right to teach, the "Licentia docendi", a right which could be granted, in the University of Paris, only by the Chancellor of the Cathedral of Notre Dame, or the Chancellor of St. Geneviève. According to the Third Council of Lateran, held in 1179, this Licentia docendi had to be granted gratuitously, and to all duly qualified applicants.
If the new member stayed in the university and continued to take an active part in its teaching, he was called a "magister regens", a practising teacher. If he were to look for another career, however, he would become "non regens": a passive member of the corporation of masters, without losing his affiliation to it, which usually lasted for life.
An example of regent master was William Vorilong, French philosopher of the Middle Ages.

Happily Ever After (How I Met Your Mother)

"Happily Ever After" is the sixth episode in the fourth season of the television series "How I Met Your Mother" and 70th overall. It originally aired on November 3, 2008.
Plot.
The day after Stella ran out on their wedding, Ted is unusually happy. The rest of his friends (other than Barney, who is just happy Ted isn't married) are worried about him, thinking that he is repressing his emotions. Over the course of two weeks, the group tries to be there for Ted, but he insists he is fine. Eventually, the group becomes frustrated, and pushes him to unleash his emotions. Though he refuses, he does reveal that he has a map of New York to help him avoid running into Stella. Using the map, they decide to go to dinner at a restaurant recommended by one of Lily's friends.
Unfortunately, it soon turns out that friend was actually Stella, who appears at the restaurant while the group are waiting to eat. Panicking, Ted ducks under the table, with the rest of the group reluctantly following his example. Stella places an order to go, so they decide to wait for her to leave. Lily tells Ted he is being stupid, and says he should face Stella. Ted replies that Lily would do the same thing in his position, if "Gasser" walked in.
Lily reveals that, in ninth grade, she sat next to a boy named Michael Sasser, who was on the edge of becoming a cool kid. In one lesson, Lily lets out a loud fart, and rather than be humiliated in front of her friends, blamed Sasser, giving him the nickname 'Gasser', and he was teased so badly he had to switch schools. Back under the table, Lily says that if Michael were to walk in, she would go over and apologize, and face her fear, inviting Ted to do the same. Barney agrees, saying that there are plenty of women he slept with he doesn't want to see again, but he still would not hide from them. Ted mentions Becca Delucci, which seems to upset Barney.
Becca is revealed to be a girl in prison Barney used to go to for sex. On one visit, Barney tried to chat up another inmate, causing a fight to break out. Since then, Barney has received threats from Becca on multiple occasions. Ted decides that everyone wants to hide from someone, and that they should stay under the table until the problem goes away.
Robin agrees with Ted, saying she would hide from her father if he were to walk in. Flashbacks show Robin's father (Eric Braeden) to be disappointed to have a daughter instead of a son, and raised her as if she were a boy. Things got worse, when Robin's father found her kissing one of her hockey team-mates when she was 14, leading to an exposition of the Canadian equivalent of Baseball metaphors for sex, based upon Ice Hockey. After this she decided to move in with her mother.
Ted realizes all his friends are haunted by problems in their past, but it isn't too late for him to face up to his. He decides to talk to Stella, but finds she has already left. They hail a cab and follow her, but Ted still refuses to get angry, and instead wants to talk things out, despite protests from his friends. When they realize Stella isn't going back to New Jersey, but to Tony's apartment, he is enraged that she wouldn't move into the city for him, but would for Tony. Finally, Ted unleashes his emotions, and his overjoyed friends cheer him on.
Ted imagines himself confronting Stella, telling her she made the wrong choice and should have been with him, as Tony will only let her down again. When he actually goes to talk to her, however, he sees her and Tony with their daughter, and decides that they were meant to be a family, his anger quickly subsiding. Future Ted announces that rather than swallowing your anger, or throwing it in someone's face, the best idea is to simply let it go, so you can move on. Finally, Ted gets rid of his map, so he can get on with his life.
Critical response.
AVClub gave the episode an A rating.

Ellen A. Martin

Ellen Annette Martin (January 16, 1847 – March 13, 1916) was an early and little-known American attorney who achieved an early victory in securing women's suffrage in Illinois. She was the first woman to vote in Illinois.
Ellen Martin graduated the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor law school in 1875 and was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1875 or 1876.
On April 6, 1891, in Lombard Illinois, Ellen Martin led a group of 14 prominent women to the voting place at the general store. Although suffrage was restricted to men in Illinois at that time, Lombard was governed by its pre-1870 compact which omitted any mention of gender. Miss Martin therefore demanded that the three male election judges allow the women to vote. Reportedly, the voting judges were flabbergasted by Miss Martin: "Mr. Marquardt was taken with a spasm, Reber leaned stiff against the wall, and Vance fell backward into the flour barrel." 
A county judge eventually proclaimed the legitimacy of the women's votes, which became the first women's votes tabulated in Illinois history. Thus, Ellen Martin was the first woman in Illinois to vote. However, the men of Lombard quickly reorganized the town charter in line with the state charter, so that women were only allowed to vote in school elections. By 1916, Illinois women could vote in national elections, and the 19th Amendment (the Women's Suffrage Amendment) was passed in 1920.
In 2008 the city of Lombard, Illinois declared April 6 to be "Ellen Martin Day" in commemoration of Ms. Martin's historic victory for women's suffrage.

Scottish Women's Football League First Division Cup

The Scottish Women's Football League First Division Cup is a cup competition in Scottish women's football, a competition only open to teams in the First Division, the second highest division in Scottish women's football. There are four rounds, including the final.
Background.
The trophy was originally called the Scottish Women's League Cup. It was one of the three major honours in women's football in Scotland along with the Scottish League Championship and the Scottish Women's Cup. It was open to all teams that were members of the football league system in Scotland. This was until the creation of the Scottish Women's Premier League and with the Scottish Women's Premier League Cup in the summer of 2002.
The Premier League Cup was a competition exclusively for only teams that were a part of the Premier League. This meant that Scotland's top division already had its own League Cup competition, so the Scottish Women's League Cup was renamed the Scottish Women's Football League Cup. The cup was exclusively for First and Second Division teams (similar to men's Scottish Challenge Cup).
In 2012, the SWF launched separate cup competitions for First and Second Division teams. So the trophy is now an exclusively all First Division competition.
Since 2009, women's football in Scotland has adopted a summer season which now runs from March to November each year, which is now why the competition is played in a single calendar year.

Shukeiri was pro-Ottoman, favoring that Palestine continue to be part of the Ottoman Empire and in 1908 and 1912, he was elected to the Ottoman parliament. From the latter year to 1914, he served as the deputy of the District of Acre. Afterwards, he held several posts in Palestine's religious judiciary, including librarian of the Imperial Library and member of the Sharia court in Istanbul. During World War I, he was appointed mufti of the Fourth Ottoman Army in Syria and Palestine.
Shukeiri rejected the values of the Palestinian Arab nationalist movement and routinely collaborated with Zionist leaders, meeting them regularly. He had a part in every pro-Zionist Arab organization from the beginning of the British Mandate until his death in 1940 and he publicly rejected Mohammad Amin al-Husayni’s use of Islam against Zionism.
In 1930, he founded the Liberal Party in Palestine and became head of the Supreme Muslim Council during the era of British rule in Palestine. One of his children, Ahmad Shukeiri, later became the first leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

Catch as Cats Can

Catch as Cats Can is a 1947 animated cartoon featuring caricatures of Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby as birds, and a cat that resembles Sylvester the Cat.
It was only one of three non-Bugs Bunny cartoons from 1947 not to be reissued. The others were "Mexican Joyride" and "A Pest in the House".
Plot.
An emaciated canary, singing like Frank Sinatra, is getting on the nerves of a pipe-puffing parrot, who speaks like Bing Crosby. The parrot spots a cat, foraging through the trash. Telling the cat he needs more vitamins (which the canary has been swallowing in bulk), he lures the cat inside to snare the canary. The straightforward approach fails (the canary bops him in the nose). He carves a female canary from soap, lures Frankie there; the birds slide down a greased counter, into the sink, and down the drain, but only the soap bird goes through the pipe and down the cat's throat. A trail of birdseed into the garage seems to work, but Frankie jacks the cat's mouth open. The cat laces the vitamins with buckshot, but the magnet attracts everything metal in sight except his prey. The canary turns the cat's vacuum cleaner against him, with a crash in the fireplace giving the cat a hot-stomach; as he buries his head in the sink, the bird adds Foamo-Seltzer to the water; the cat rockets off, crashing into a wall. The cat finally realizes the portly parrot is a better meal; he is later shown sitting on the parrot's perch, imitating his mannerisms.

Atalyja

Atalyja (“The rain is coming”) is a Lithuanian folk-rock music band. It seeks to popularize archaic Lithuanian folklore and bring the ancient songs closer to the contemporary listener. The band's creations boast a big variety of musical styles, rich tonal palette and unique and ingenious arrangements. The ancient melodies are enriched with elements of rock, jazz, funk, blues rock, metal and Indian music. Atalyja regularly participates in music festivals and fests. The band has released 4 CD albums and gave performances in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Germany, Turkey, Czech Republic, Belarus and Russia.
Over more than ten years of its existence Atalyja has earned love of listeners of different age groups. The main part of the repertoire consists of sutartinės (polyphonic archaic songs – glees), calendar, war-historical, and wedding songs. Musical expression ranges from meditative improvisation to hard compositional art rock. Experimentation is not unfamiliar to the band musicians – the melodies of traditional songs are mixed with elements of classic rock, metal rock, blues rock, funk, and progressive rock, as well as classical music.
The bands’s composing manner is marked by professional, dainty artistical arrangements, rich tonal palette, diverse rhythms, and unique polyphony. Traditional Lithuanian instruments (kanklės, panpipes, violin, bagpipe, jaw harp are ingeniously combined with electric and bass guitars, rock percussion. Some songs are coloured with oriental shades of North Indian instruments: the bansuri (transverse Indian bamboo flute) as well as tabla (Indian pair drum).
History.
Lithuanian folkrock band Atalyja formed in the autumn of 1998, and in the spring of 1999 they made their debut in Kaunas, in postfolk festival “Suklegos”.

The second album „Močia“ (The Mother) which saw daylight in 2004 (CD, Dangus records) is marked by vivid, warm sound. It was recognized as one of the most solid modern folk music releases in Lithuanian discography. In the third album “Saula riduolėla” – “Sun the Roller” (2009, Dangus records) “strict” composition blends with improvisation and experiments in an original way. Not only is the solar theme emphasized by the titles of some songs or the album itself, but is also further strengthened by the album's colourful and sunny sound.
Currently there are three female vocalists in the band – Gedimina Statulevičienė, Audronė Daraškevičienė and Darutė Pilibavičienė (who also plays kanklės) as well as one male vocalist and kanklės player Rytis Ambrazevičius.

Mike Mandarino

Michael Pascol Mandarino (born March 16, 1921 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – 1985) was an American football offensive lineman. He is one of only two La Salle Explorers to enter the National Football League. Mandarino used the money he earned as a professional football player to enter medical school, later providing medical services to the team he played for, the Philadelphia Eagles 
While playing for the Eagles, Mandarino reportedly attended classes from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.. He would then rushed to the ballpark to practice under the lights with the Eagles, and after the game on Sundays he would again return to his studies. He repeated this routine in 1945, while as an intern. he reportedly earned $200 per game. 
According to Mandarino, coach Greasy Neale reportedly told him to play tackle after Vic Sears was injured. Neale stated that "If you are smart enough to be a doctor, you are smart enough to learn two sets of plays". The following week, both of Eagles' centers, Bap Manzini and Vic Lindskog, were injured, so Greasy came back and told Mandarino that he "should be smart enough to learn three sets of plays".
He later taught at La Salle and won international fame for his research in orthopedic surgery.

Per Reidarson

Per Reidarson (1879 – 1954) was a Norwegian composer and music critic.
In the early twentieth century he was an acknowledged composer. For his body of work he was granted "kunstnerlønn", a guaranteed minimum income for artists, by the Norwegian state in 1938. He had also worked as a music critic in the newspapers "Tidens Tegn" and "Arbeiderbladet".
However, he eventually joined the political party Nasjonal Samling and began writing for their official publication "Fritt Folk". In 1941-1942, while Norway was occupied by Germany, he held the lecture "Norsk og unorsk i musikken" ('Norwegian and Un-Norwegian in Music'), anger directed at the perceived "Jewish and Marxist" Modernist music.
In 1945, when the occupation of Norway ended, Reidarson was marginalized and immediately lost his artist's income.

Tomlinson Middle School

Tomlinson Middle School (Connecticut) (TMS) is a secondary school located in Fairfield, Connecticut. TMS serves 775 of Fairfields students in the middle school age group. Its current principal is Mrs.Bonina
Tomlinson Middle School History.
By 1914, 78 adolescent Fairfield students were attending high school in Bridgeport and Westport with Fairfield paying the bill since the town offered education through grade eight only. In February 1914, the Board of Education asked Fairfield residents to make contributions towards the creation of a high school. The School Board voted to establish the first year of a high school course. The forty-six freshman students operated out of the basement of the new brick and concrete Sherman Elementary School (built on the current site of the town's gazebo), a gift to the town from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel H. Wheeler replacing the old cupola toped wooden building that stood before it. In 1915, a second class was added on with the forming of a tenth grade.
In November 1916, Miss Annie Burr Jennings, prominent "outstanding" citizen and the first lady of Fairfield, bought the Brown Estate on Unquowa Road and donated the building to the town of Fairfield to be used as a high school. The old wooden house had twelve rooms and six acres of land. It had porches on the front and street sides with a cupola on top, (Jennings Beach was also 'Miss Annie B'—as many called her—property which she gave to the town.
The Brown Residence was referred to as the "Little Red Schoolhouse" by the students for many years. By this time a third class, the eleventh grade, was beginning and in 1917 the fourth class of twelfth graders was added.
After appropriate renovations, the 'Little Red Schoolhouse' consisted of two long rooms separated by a wide hall, both downstairs and up with restrooms in the basement. Two small rooms off both the east and west rear were used; One was the office of the principal, William E. Smith, who also taught classes in math and music. The other room (formerly the kitchen) became the library and history room. The attic rooms were used as science labs. A small room on the second floor front was the teachers' room where they often ate lunch. 
Students enjoyed the porches and school grounds which included a latticed gazebo on the front lawn. Classes were held from 9 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. with a half hour for lunch and sometimes one study period. Two to three hours of homework were required. Students from Southport and Stratfield came by trolley car and Greenfield Hill students came by bus.
Graduation exercises were first held in the American Legion Hall on Reef Road. The first graduates in 1918 were required to take college entrance exams, but after that, Fairfield High School students were considered to be so well prepared that they were accepted to all Ivy League Colleges by certificate alone.
The school continued to grow under the leadership of William E. Smith. It was necessary to construct two portables in the back of the school to take care of the increasing student body. Later these portables were removed to Holland Hill School. (However, once again to ease overcrowding one of the portables was returned out of necessity and used in the 1960s as an annex to house the art and mechanical drawing departments.) In March 1924, ground was broken for the south wing of the school. This was the first in a series of additions, designed by O.C.S. Ziroli. This wing was attached to the original wooden building and completed in one year's time, It included the original gymnasium (presently the Tomlinson Library).
The main building was the next addition and it consisted of six large rooms:,the principal's office and teachers' rooms with corridors that led to the old building in the rear and to the gymnasium wing. The second floor housed biology, history and science departments. The basement held the Sewing and Domestic Science rooms and a cafeteria.
On September 3, 1925, Roger Ludlowe High School (named after Fairfield's founder) was dedicated. The original building plans included a north wing onto the main building which would include an auditorium, but this project was delayed to cut down on expenses.
Starting in the spring of 1930, the proposed building of the north wing began. It took just over a year to complete. This addition consisted of the auditorium, new cafeteria, and ten classrooms plus additional basement rooms.
Named after William E. Smith, the Superintendent of Schools and the first principal of the high school, the auditorium was designed to harmonize with the main building and the south wing. The north wing addition completed in 1931 also included an "L" on the rear. The ten classrooms were on two floors, each with a main corridor which was at right angles to a corridor that extends from the main building to the old wooden building at the south end.
The third floor of the original building was used for storage and the first and second by the Commercial department (typewriting) and for study halls. The west room on the second floor was used as a library and the former school board room was outfitted as a dispensary. The school at this point had a capacity of 850 students, the projected enrollment for 1932-33.
By the year 1938, the school again was overcrowded and it became necessary to send members of the Art, mechanical drawing, and General Shop classes to the old Sherman School downtown. Three classrooms were reserved for the high school. In the spring of 1942, the 'Little Red Schoolhouse' was demolished and the east wing complete with shops, a library, and additional classrooms added. This addition included three floors on the north and south sections, but no second and third floors in the center. First and second floor connecting corridors were added.
In 1944 a second floor was built on the west center section. This addition included the Health Department and the Electrical Shop with new corridors connecting east and west wings.
In 1952 due to crowded conditions it was necessary to hold two sessions of school. This arrangement continued until June 1956. In September of that same year, a second high school, Andrew Warde Senior High (now Fairfield Warde High School) was opened. Sometime in the late 1950s, the second and third floor center section was completed.
1962 marked the last year Roger Ludlowe High School existed as a high school on the old Brown property. Mill Plain School, down the road, was converted to a Senior High School retaining the name of Roger Ludlowe High School (Now Fairfield Ludlowe High School).
The first high school in Fairfield became Tomlinson Junior High School, named after Gideon Tomlinson, a prominent resident of Fairfield that served as a member of Congress, Governor of Connecticut, and as a U.S. Senator. In 1977, the south wing was completely renovated—the gymnasium became the library and a new gymnasium and more classrooms below the original basement level were added.
With the beginning of the school year in 1984, the sixth grades from several of the surrounding schools were added to the school and it became known as Tomlinson Middle School.
On January 26, 2004, the Representative Town Meeting gave their approval for the renovation of Tomlinson, which began in June 2004.

TMS Athletics.
TMS has both girls and boys varsity and junior varsity basketball teams. Basketball is the "largest" sport and is the focus of the annual Pep Rally, which takes place the day before Thanksgiving. Tomlinson also has a girl's field hockey team, a track and cross-country team, cheerleading, golf, and a drop-in flag football league. Finally, there is a ski club that goes on a February trip to Bretton Woods and Loon Mountain in New Hampshire.
Construction and renovation.
Tomlinson Middle School was recently renovated to a 'Like New' state. The entire building was reconstructed into a state-of-the-art learning facility to serve 609 of Fairfields students in the middle school age group. The renovation included an update to ADA and building codes, as well as life safety systems. An addition at the east side of the school added new and needed classroom and locker space. The library was moved to the fourth floor, and a new auxiliary gymnasium was constructed at the old library location. Upgrades to the buildings HVAC system and mechanical systems were also included with the renovation plan to improve the air quality in the building. The auditorium was mostly left untouched to preserve its original style when it was constructed in the early 20th century. The town of Fairfield also invested in an artificial turf field for the school.
Tomlinson clubs and activities.
Tomlinson has many great clubs and activities, from yearbook to ski club. The list varies throughout the year, and clubs shut down and start up in relation to interest and attendance.
Communities.
Tomlinson students are divided into "communities" (called teams and pods at the other Fairfield middle schools). For many years there has been three sixth grade communities, and two for both seventh and eighth grade (two in each). The names of each community were taken from the 'TMS' acronym. Sixth grade had T, M, and S, seventh and eighth each had T and S. However with the 2009-10 school year brought extra sixth graders, which called the need for a fourth sixth grade community. G was picked up from Tomlinson's namesake, Gideon Tomlinson. Typically there are four teachers in each community, with certain teachers sharing grades and communities. Languages (Spanish and French are offered) are mixed-community, as are "UA's" (Unified Arts)
Unified Arts Classes.
Tomlinson's non-core classes are called unified arts classes, or UA's. Sixth grade UA's are Health, Art, Computers, and Home Ec. For Home Ec. the 10-week marking period is split into two five-week classes- cooking and sewing. In seventh grad the schedule is much the same, however Computers is substituted for "Tech Ed."- one half of the marking period is Woodshop, and the other is Computers/Manufacturing/Construction. Eighth grade UA's are electives, ranked at the end of the seventh-grade year. Students typically get their top two or three classes, and a mandatory health class takes up the marking period left. Eighth grade students can choose from 3-D Art, 2-D Art, Foods, Sewing, Computers, Manufacturing and Construction, Transportation Technology and Alternative Energy, or Design and Communication Technology. 
All TMS students have gym twice a week, where they are exposed to numerous enriching units such as Project Adventure (rock climbing), Wii/Dance Dance Revolution, Fitness Room (weights, stationary bikes, etc.), as well as the typical gym units- volleyball, football, capture the flag, etc. 
Students also take a music class three times a week. Music options are: Orchestra, Band, Chorus, Music Tech (keyboard), Orchestra-Chorus, and Band-Chorus.
Leveled Classes.
TMS resource classes (or "Reading") are available during homeroom, in place of music, or in place of a language. Guidance and teachers help to make the decision to move a student to resource along with the student's parents. Math is leveled throughout all three grades, and classes available are Math (sixth grade), Pre-Algebra, and Algebra. Most math teachers teach two levels to one grade level- sometimes referred to as 6-1, 6-2, 7-1, 7-2, and on. Certain advanced eighth grade students take the bus to Ludlowe Middle School during homeroom and first period, to be taught Geometry (high school course) along with advanced students from RLMS ( Roger Ludlowe Middle School ) Starting in seventh grade there have been options of "Language Arts Workshop" and "Extended Language Arts Workshop". (Classes were the same length, the content was extended. However, with the 2009-2010 school year seventh grade has phased back into writing and reading "workshops", and eighth grade will follow in the 2010-2011 school year.

First National Bank and Trust Building (Lima, Ohio)

The First National Bank and Trust Building is a historic building on Public Square in downtown Lima, Ohio, United States.
This rectangular building, completed in 1926, was designed by Weary and Alford, an architectural firm from Chicago. It was the location of the offices of the First National Bank and Trust Company from 1926 until 1974, when the company became a part of Huntington Bank. The structure's twelve stories are faced with Indiana Limestone. Each column of windows is topped with an arch window on the highest floor, and the spandrels between the arch windows are connected to each other.
Founded as the "Lima Trust Company" in 1903, the First National Bank and Trust used a Masonic building in its earliest years. Starting in 1906, it operated in a smaller building (now destroyed), which served as its offices until it moved into its newly erected structure in 1926. During the early twentieth century, the influence of railroads and the oil industry caused Lima to be a very prosperous city. Many large buildings, including two skyscrapers, were built in the city's downtown; the majority of these new structures employed the Chicago Style of architecture. With the decline of the city's economy later in the century, the construction of large buildings in central Lima ceased — virtually all new construction took place in the city's outskirts or suburbs — thus making the First National Bank and Trust one of the newest major buildings in downtown Lima. In recognition of its historic significance, the First National Bank and Trust was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It was one of seventeen Lima buildings that was added to the National Register as part of the "Lima Multiple Resource Area," a Multiple Property Submission that concentrated on architecturally significant buildings in or near downtown Lima.
Aside from its importance as a historic site, the First National Bank and Trust Building plays a leading part in local ornithology: the building is a nesting site for Peregrine Falcons and is part of the Midwest Peregrine Falcon Restoration Project.

Tabimorelin

Tabimorelin (NN-703) is a drug which acts as a potent, orally active growth hormone secretagogue, mimicking the effects of the endogenous peptide agonist ghrelin as a stimulator of growth hormone release. It was one of the first GH secretagogues developed and is largely a modified polypeptide, but it is nevertheless orally active "in vivo". Tabimorelin produced sustained increases in levels of growth hormone and IGF-1, along with smaller transient increases in levels of other hormones such as ACTH, cortisol and prolactin. However actual clinical effects on growth-hormone deficient adults were limited, with only the most severely GH-deficient patients showing significant benefit, and tabimorelin was also found to act as a CYP3A4 inhibitor which could cause it to have undesirable interactions with other drugs.

Mokshas

The Mokshas (also "Mokshans", "Moksha people", in ) are a Mordvinian ethnic group belonging to the Volgaic branch of the Finnic peoples who live in the Russian Federation, mostly near the Volga and Moksha rivers, a tributary of the Oka River. 
Their native language is Mokshan, one of the two surviving members of the Mordvinic branch of the Uralic language family. According to the 1994 Russian census, 49% of the autochthonal Finnic population in Mordovia identified themselves as Mokshas, i.e. more than 180,000 people. Most Mokshas belong to the Russian Orthodox Church; other religions practised by Mokshas include Lutheranism and paganism.
Name.
The term "Moksha" is derived from the Indo-Iranian (, "liberation", "salvation") which came from the Scythians and Sarmatians near whom the Mokshas are believed to have lived in prehistory. This term appears at a rather late date, in the 13th century. Rubruck, the Franciscan monk who was sent to the Mongols, called them "Moxel". The same term is used in the Persian chronicle of Rashid-al-Din. According to popular tradition the Russians first used the term "Mordva" to refer only to the Erzya people but later used it for both the Erzyas and the Mokshas. The term "Moksha" begins to appear in Russian sources in the 17th century.
The Mokshas are known in local languages as: 
History.
Prehistory.
The breakup of the Volga Finns into separate groups is believed to have begun around 1200 BC. The Moksha people cannot be traced earlier because they did not possess a distinctive burial tradition before that time. According to archeological data, bodies in early Mokshan burials were oriented with their heads to the south. 
Herodotus mentions Androphagi living in the forests between the upper waters of the Dnieper and Don, north of Scythia; this people is believed to be identifiable with the Gorodets culture, and with the early Moksha, making Herodotus's report the first appearance of the Mokshas in written history. Herodotus also describes the Scythian-Persian war of 516-512 BC, which involved the entire population of the Middle Volga. During this war the Sarmatians forced out the Scythians and subdued some Moksha clans. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, Antes, Slavs, Mokshas and Erzyas became the most numerous and powerful population in East Europe. By the end of the 4th century, most Mokshas had joined the Hunnic tribal alliance, taken part in the defeat of the Ostrogothic Empire in 377, and subsequently moved eastward and settled in Pannonia. Evidence of the Hunnic connection includes Mokshan battle harnesses, especially the bits and psalia, which are identical to early Hunnic battle harnesses. Archeological data show that the boundaries of Moksha territory did not change between the fourth and 8th centuries. In 450, the Mokshas were in alliance with a people of the Middle Volga known as the Burtas, who were possibly Alans.
Middle Ages.
During the second Arab-Khazar War in 737, Arab armies under the command of Marwan ibn Muhammad reached the right bank of the Volga and came into conflict with the Burtas on their way to the left or "Khazar" bank of Volga. Circa 889-890, the Khazars were at war with the Burtas, the Oghuz and the Pechenegs. In 913, after a war between the Arsiyah and the Rus' at Atil began, five thousand Rus' survivors escaped up the Volga where most of them were killed by the Burtas. In 932, the Khazar King Aaron formed a war alliance with the Oghuz. Circa 940, during the reign of King Joseph, the Khazars entered into an alliance with the Burtas. Afterwards the Burtas Seliksa principality became a vassal of the Khazar khanate. In 965, Sviatoslav I of Kiev “attacked the Khazars' allies, captured Sarkel and Bulgaria, and reached Semender” according to Ibn Haukal. Two years later, after the Great Flood, he seized and destroyed Atil. At the beginning of the 10th century Almush (Almış) the king of Volga Bulgaria took control of the "Khazar tribute". He converted to Islam, formed an alliance with the caliph of Baghdad Al-Muktafi, and founded a trading post at the mouth of the Oka river. The Kievan prince Vladimir seized Bolghar in 985. King Almush and Prince Vladimir signed a peace and trade treaty in 1006 which was the beginning of an "eternal peace" that lasted for 80 years. War for domination of the Oka River and the Erzyan fortress Obran Osh started again in 1120. Prince Yury of the city of Vladimir seized Oshel in 1220 and demanded a reduction of Bulgarian influence over the Erzyan kingdom (Purgas Rus). The latter was allied with Volga Bulgaria. Vladimirian princes captured and destroyed Obran Osh in 1221 and founded Nizhny Novgorod on the site. The Erzyan King Purgaz and the Mokshan King Puresh were at war and while Purgaz was allied with Volga Bulgaria, Puresh was an ally of Prince Yury. In 1230 Purgaz laid siege to Nizhny Novgorod but was defeated. After that Puresh’s son Prince Tyushtyan with his Polovets allies raided into Purgaz's lands and completely destroyed his kingdom.
As recorded by Rashid-al-Din in his Jami al-Tawarikh, 4 September 1236 was the date on which the sons of Jochi - Batu, Orda, and Berke, Ugedei’s son Kadan, Chagatai’s grandson Büri, and Jenghiz Khan’s son Kulkan declared war on the Mokshas, Burtas and Erzyas. This war ended on 23 August 1237 with a crucial victory for the Mongols at the Black Forest close to the border of the Principality of Ryazan. 
King Puresh of the Mokshans submitted to Batu Khan and was required personally to lead his army as a vassal in Mongol-Tartar military campaigns.
At the beginning of 1241 the Mongol army seized Kiev, then crossed the Carpathian mountains and invaded Poland. Roger Bacon in his Opus Majus writes that the Mokshas were in the vanguard of the Mongol army and took part in the capture of Lublin and Zawichost in Poland. Benedict Polone reports that the Mokshan army suffered serious losses during the capture of Sandomierz in February and Krakow in March of the same year. On 9 April 1241 the Mongol army defeated the allied Polish and German armies at the Battle of Legnica. It is believed King Puresh was slain in that battle. Shortly after that battle the Mokshan army declared to Batu that they refused to fight against Germans. According to reports by William Rubruck and Roger Bacon, the Mokshas had previously negotiated with the Germans and Bohemians regarding the possibility of joining their side in order to escape from their forced vassalage to Batu. It is known that Subutai ordered the punishment of the conspirators; thousands of Mokshas were put to death, but approximately a third escaped and returned to their homeland. Another third remained in the vanguard of the Mongol army and marched into Hungary through the Verecke Pass in March 1242, according to the Hungarian bishop Stephan II and Matthew of Paris.
Geographic distribution.
Mokshas live mostly in the central and western parts of the Republic of Mordovia, and neighbouring areas of Tambov Oblast and in the western and central parts of Penza Oblast. Populations of Mokshas also live in Orenburg Oblast, Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Altai Krai, as well as in diaspora communities in Estonia, Kazakhstan, the United States, and Australia.
Anthropology.
Mokshas are typical Caucasians with a predominance of North Pontic racial types and also some Lapponic race elements. The Lapponic race is a variation of the Uralic race. Common characteristics are short height, very inferior[???] face, distinct cheekbones, a concave nose bridge, and a low percentage of epicanthus. Representative of the Lapponic race are the Lapps (Sami). The formation of this anthropological type took place somewhere in north Norway, northern Finland and the Kola peninsula. This type includes Lapps and to some extent Komi-Permians and Mokshas. According to I. Gokhman, anthropologically Lapps are characterized as follows: The cranium is short and wide, the body of medium height. The forehead is of average width and angle and is moderately protuberant. The inferior face is distinctively wide and orthognathic, however some crania have distinct alveolar prognathism with a wide nose (characteristic of the Australoid race). The nose is weakly prominent, the nose bridge is concave, the tip and base of the nose are elevated. The hair is straight and soft, with little body and facial hair. Pigmentation is moderately dark. Lapponics thus have characteristics of all three major races: Caucasian (orthognathic face), Southern (prognathism, wide nose; characteristics not always observed) and Mongoloid (flat face, protruding cheekbones, occasional epicanthic folds).
Culture.
Language.
Mokshas speak the Moksha language, which is a member of the Mordvinic branch of the Uralic languages.
Mythology.
In traditional Mokshan mythology the world was created by "Ińe Narmon" (Great Bird), referred to in folklore as "Akša Loksti" (White Swan). The first thing "Ińe Narmon" created was water. "Yakśarga" (Duck) brought sand from the bottom of the sea and "Ińe Narmon" took the sand and with it formed the earth with "Ińe Šufta" (The Great Tree) on it. "Ińe Narmon" made its nest on "Ińe Šufta", which is usually referred to as "Kelu" (birch) in folklore. "Akša Kal" (White Sturgeon) carried the earth with the roots of "Ińe Šufta" on its back. "Ińe Narmon" had three nestlings: "Tsofks" (Nightingale), "Kuku" (Cuckoo), and "Ožarga" (Skylark). "Tsofks" chose bushes and willows for his home, "Kuku" settled in the forest, and "Ožarga" went to the meadows. Another of the old deities mentioned in Mokshan folklore was "Mešavane" (Mother Bee). Since the Christianization of the Mokshans the Mokshan Supreme God has usually been called "Värden Škai" (Supreme Creator). 
According to later legends the creation of the world went through several stages: first the "Idemevs" (Devil) was asked by the God to bring sand from the bottom of the great sea. "Idemevs" hid some sand in his mouth. When "Värden Škai" started creating the earth, this hidden sand started to grow in the mouth of "Idemevs". He had to spit it out and thus chasms and mountains appeared on the previously level and beautiful earth. The first humans created by "Värden Škai" could live for 700–800 years and were giants 99 arshins (yards) tall. The underworld in Mokshan mythology was ruled by "Mastoratia". The souls of heroes, clan elders and warriors slain in battle travelled after death to the emerald green isle of "Usiya", where they sat at a long table together with the great King Ťušťen drinking pure mead.

He first entered the national production car championship in 1991, winning the overall championship a year later in 1992. In 1994 he got a works drive for the Opel team, helping to develop the new car. He was class B champion in 1995 driving his Opel two litre Astra and also won his debut race in the South African Touring Car Championship. After finishing third in class in 1996, he went on to dominate the championship winning the title in 1997 and 1998. In 1999 he drove in the South African Touring Car Championship, finishing tenth on points in a Petronas Opel Vectra. He went on to finish second in the final full year of the championship. From 2001 through to 2003, he raced in the WesBank V8 Series, driving an Opel Astra. He never raced a full season, but won several selected races that he drove in.
In 2004 he got his big break in the British Touring Car Championship driving a works Proton Impian for Petronas Syntium Proton, alongside team mate Fariqe Hairuman. He impressed many people with his driving and pace that season, but the team was under-funded and the car was well off the pace of the other works teams. He placed fourteenth on points and at the end of the season Proton withdrew from the championship and he returned to South Africa.

Video aggregator

A video aggregator is a website that collects and organizes online videos from other sources. Video aggregation is done for different purposes, and websites take different approaches to achieve their purpose.
Some sites try to collect videos of high quality or interest for visitors to view. The collection may be made by editors or may be based on community votes. Another method is to base the collection on those videos most viewed, either at the aggregator site or at various popular video hosting sites.
Some sites exist to allow users to collect their own sets of videos, for personal use as well as browsing and viewing by others. These sites can develop online communities around video sharing. Other sites allow users to create a personalized video playlist, for personal use as well as for browsing and viewing by others.
List.
There are many video aggregators. Sites that are estimated to have at least 500,000 unique U.S. visitors per month include:
In 2008, "VideoNuze" reported that investors had provided more than $366 million in capital to certain "top" video aggregators to date.
Video hosting sites, general media hosting sites, and social networking sites can perform video aggregation as a secondary function, and video aggregators can also serve to some extent as hosting and social networking services.

Arnold Rørholt

Arnold Rørholt (14 June 1884 – 1961) was a Norwegian military officer, known as a resistance member during World War II. He was also the secretary-general of the Royal Norwegian Automobile Club for many years.
Career.
He was born in Hamar. He finished his secondary education in 1901 and graduated from the Norwegian Military Academy in 1905. He also graduated from the Norwegian Military College in 1907, and started working for the General Staff. He worked in Oslo Militære Samfund from 1909 to 1926. From 1918 to 1920 he was the secretary of the Association of Regular Officers () and edited their periodical "Vår Hær". In 1926 he moved to the Royal Norwegian Automobile Club, where he was secretary-general from 1929 to 1949 and chief executive from 1949 to 1953. He edited their magazine "Motorliv" as well as their yearbook. After retiring from the Royal Norwegian Automobile Club he was hired in the Norwegian Armed Forces department of war history. He had already released a book about Oslo Militære Samfund; in 1925. In 1955 he became chairman of the pensioners' association Landslaget for statspensjonister, succeeding Per Skotte. Rørholt was deputy chairman from 1953 to 1955.
In the military he reached the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was a member of the illegal resistance group Milorg during the German occupation of Norway. He became a member of the inner circle "Rådet" in May 1943, but had to flee to Sweden in January 1945. He continued the resistance from Stockholm until the May 1945 liberation of Norway, and was a member of the police troops in Sweden. His son Bjørn, whom he had together with Luise Fredrikke Lund (1891–1965), was also involved in the resistance, as a Secret Intelligence Service officer. When Rørholt's group Skylark B was unveiled by the Germans in September 1941, Arnold Rørholt was arrested by the Nazi authorities as a hostage. He was incarcerated at Møllergata 19 from 12 September 1941 to 23 April 1942, then at Grini concentration camp until 9 November 1942.

Organofluorine compound

[[Image:Fluorocarbon-montage.svg|thumb|85px|Some important organofluorine compounds
A: fluoromethane
B: isoflurane
C: a CFC
D: an HFC
E: triflic acid
F: Teflon
G: PFOS
H: fluorouracil
I: Prozac
Organofluorine compounds are organic chemical compounds that contain carbon and fluorine bonded in the polarized and remarkably strong carbon–fluorine bond. Organofluorine compounds are diverse, they can be fluorocarbons, perfluorinated, or biologically synthesized mono-fluorinated compounds, among other possibilities. These compounds have a wide range of function and can serve as refrigerants, pharmaceuticals, agrichemicals, surfactants, ozone depletors, poisons, or pollutants. 
Bond.
The carbon–fluorine bond is referred to as the strongest in organic chemistry because of stability added by its partial ionic character; it forms the strongest single bond to carbon. The ionic character is a result of the electronegativity of fluorine. It induces partial charges on the carbon and fluorine atoms, leading to electrostatic attraction, making the bond short and strong. 
Compounds.
Organofluorine compounds that have the carbon–fluorine bond are diverse in their types. They can be fluorocarbons, fluorocarbon derivatives, fluorinated pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals, or mono-fluorinated biologically synthesized compounds, among others. Fluorocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and fluorine, while other molecules that contain many carbon–fluorine bonds are commonly referred to as fluorocarbons. Pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals commonly contain only one fluorine or a trifluoromethyl group. However, some are more highly fluorinated, such as hexaflumuron, which has six fluorines, in large part to a tetrafluoroethoxy functional group. All known biologically synthesized organofluorines contain only one carbon–fluorine bond.
Fluorocarbons.
Fluorocarbons are molecules that "only" contain carbon and fluorine. They can be gases, liquids, waxes, or solids, depending upon their molecular weight. The simplest fluorocarbon is the gas tetrafluoromethane (CF4). Liquids include perfluorooctane and perfluorodecalin. The fluoropolymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE/Teflon) is a solid. While fluorocarbons with single bonds are stable, unsaturated fluorocarbons are more reactive, especially those with triple bonds.
Perfluorinated compounds.
Perfluorinated compounds are fluorocarbon derivatives, as they are closely structurally related to fluorocarbons. However, they also possess new atoms such as nitrogen, iodine, or ionic groups, such as perfluorinated carboxylic acids.
Alkyl fluorides.
Alkyl monofluorides can be obtained from alcohols and Olah reagent or another fluorinating agents.
Properties.
Because of the varying degree of fluorination of organofluorine compounds, their properties are nearly impossible to compare as a group. "Every time you see a biologically active molecule that has fluorine in it, it could be in there for a different reason," says University of Florida chemistry professor William R. Dolbier Jr. By contrast, fluorocarbon based compounds are fluorinated for specific chemical, physical, and sometimes biological reasons, as they have properties that are very distinct from hydrocarbons. Organofluorines with only one carbon–fluorine bond can simply behave as a hydrocarbon. Therefore, the one salient point for all organofluorine compounds is that the carbon–fluorine bond can dramatically alter biological properties. While both uracil and 5-fluorouracil are colourless, high-melting crystalline solids, the organofluorine is a potent anti-cancer drug. Similarly, fluoroacetate is a potent natural poison while dilute acetate in water is vinegar.
Biological role.
Biologically synthesized organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants, but not animals. The most common example is fluoroacetate, which occurs as a plant defence against herbivores in at least 40 plants in Australia, Brazil and Africa. Other biologically synthesized organofluorines include ω-fluoro fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate which are all believed to be biosynthesized in biochemical pathways from the intermediate fluoroacetaldehyde. Adenosyl-fluoride synthase is an enzyme capable of biologically synthesizing the carbon–fluorine bond. Man made carbon–fluorine bonds are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals because it adds stability to the carbon framework; also, the relatively small size of fluorine is convenient as fluorine acts as an approximate bioisostere of the hydroxyl group. Introducing the carbon–fluorine bond to organic compounds is the major challenge for medicinal chemists using organofluorine chemistry, as the carbon–fluorine bond increases the probability of having a successful drug by about a factor of ten. An estimated 20% of pharmaceuticals, and 30–40% of agrichemicals are organofluorines, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole.
Environmental and health issues.
Abiotic processes can also result in organofluorines considered as "problem molecules." Fluorocarbon based CFCs and tetrafluoromethane have been reported in igneous and metamorphic rock. However, environmental and health issues still face many organofluorines. Because of the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond, many synthetic fluorocarbons and fluorcarbon-based compounds are persistent in the environment. Others, such as CFCs, participate in ozone depletion. Fluoroalkanes, commonly referred to as perfluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases. The fluorosurfactants PFOS and PFOA, and other related chemicals, are persistent global contaminants. PFOS is a persistent organic pollutant and may be harming the health of wildlife; the potential health effects of PFOA to humans are under investigation by the C8 Science Panel.

Fred Gardner (cricketer)

Fred Charles Gardner (4 June 1922 – 12 January 1979) was an English cricketer and footballer. As a footballer, he played inside-forward for Birmingham, Coventry City, Newport County, and Rugby Town. In his cricket career, he was a right-hand opening batsman who played for Warwickshire.
Football career.
Gardner was playing for Birmingham when World War II came to Europe. He guested for Port Vale in 1946. He signed with Coventry City after the war, and scored three goals in 13 league games for the "Sky Blues" as the Second Division club posted mid-table finishes in 1946–47, 1947–48, and 1948–49 under the stewardship of Billy Frith and Harry Storer. He scored two goals in four Third Division South games for Tom Bromilow's Newport County in the 1949–50 season. After leaving Rodney Parade, he played for Rugby Town and later became the trainer-coach of Lockheed Leamington.
Cricket career.
Gardner was a solid defensive player, who formed a productive opening partnership with Norman Horner. He played 338 first-class matches for his home county between 1947 and 1961, he also made one appearance for an England XI against the touring South Africans in 1955 and played once for the Players against the Gentlemen in 1957.
Gardner scored a total of 17,905 first-class runs at an average of 33.71, passing 1,000 runs in a season for ten consecutive years between 1949 and 1958. His best seasonal total came in 1950 when he scored 1,911 runs at 45.50, included in this was his highest score of his career, an innings of 215 not out against Somerset at Taunton. Also in that season, he scored centuries in both innings during the fixture with Essex at Ilford.
Gardner made his first-class debut in 1947 at the age of 25, becoming a regular in 1949 when he was awarded his county cap. He was an ever-present in the 1951 season when Warwickshire won the County Championship, he contributed 1,338 runs and 27 catches to the success.
In 1953 Gardner scored 110 against the touring Australians becoming the first Warwickshire batsman to score a hundred against an Australian side. He was awarded a benefit season in 1958, the last season in which he appeared regularly. After finishing his playing career in 1961, he joined the umpires list standing in 98 first-class matches between 1962 and 1965. Following this he dedicated time to coaching juniors in the Coventry area.
Gardner died at the age of 56, in his native Coventry, following a long illness.

The Vermont Mariners are a defunct minor league baseball team. They played in the Eastern League at Centennial Field in Burlington, Vermont in 1988. They were affiliated with the Seattle Mariners.
History.
Prior to their four-year stint as the Vermont Mariners, this franchise was known as the Vermont Reds from 1984 to 1987 and served as the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. Prior to that, the franchise was known as the Lynn Sailors from 1980 to 1983 and served as the Double-A affiliate of the Seattle Mariners (1980 to 1982) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1983). 
By September 1988, with the team in the Eastern League playoffs, team owner Mike Agganis had decided to move the franchise to Canton, Ohio. Canton was building a brand-new ballpark, Thurman Munson Memorial Stadium, which would have a capacity of 5,700. More so, the Canton metropolitan area offered twice the population of Burlington. Agganis told the New York Times, "Our attendance has averaged out to about 85,000 over five years in Burlington. In Canton, we can probably do between 225,000 and 300,000 attendance." The franchise moved to Canton after the 1988 season, affiliated with Cleveland, and became the Canton-Akron Indians.
Today, the franchise is still the Double-A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians and is known as the Akron RubberDucks.

Mike Bickle (footballer)

Michael John "Mike" Bickle (born 25 January 1944) is an English former professional footballer. He played for Plymouth Argyle and Gillingham between 1965 and 1973, before his career was cut short by injury.
Career.
Bickle was born in Plymouth but began his footballing career playing semi-professionally for St Austell of the South Western Football League while working as a milkman. Playing as a striker, he gained a reputation as a highly prolific goalscorer, attracting the attention of professional clubs, and in December 1965, at the age of nearly 22, turned professional with his hometown team, Plymouth Argyle, then of the Football League Second Division. He adjusted quickly to the higher level of football and scored 9 goals in just 17 games in his first season. He went on to be the club's top goalscorer for the following four consecutive seasons, and in total scored 71 goals in 179 league matches, but was unable to save the club from relegation to the Football League Third Division in the 1967–68 season. In November 1971 Gillingham manager Andy Nelson, who had played alongside Bickle at Home Park, signed him for the Kent-based club, after weeks of press speculation, for a fee of around £7,000.
Bickle's arrival at Priestfield Stadium saw him replacing Tommy Watson in a team struggling after relegation to the Football League Fourth Division, and he began his Gillingham career strongly, with two goals in his first five matches. He finished the 1971–72 season with seven goals to his name, making him the team's third-highest scorer. Just six matches into the following season, however, he suffered a neck injury in a match against Stockport County which kept him out of action for over two months. He made his comeback against Reading in the FA Cup in November 1972, but injured his shoulder during his comeback match and never played for the team again. In January 1973 he accepted the advice of a medical specialist and retired from the sport. He returned to his native West Country but there is no record of him having any further involvement in football.

Field Ruwe

Field Ruwe (born August 8, 1955) is a Zambian author and media practitioner, and currently the Chief Executive Officer of Africa Center (USA) based in Fresno, California, USA. In Zambia, Ruwe is known as a radio and television host, entertainer, and entrepreneur.
Writings.
As well as his radio and television journalism, Ruwe has written for newspapers and has authored books. Using research methods used in journalism, Ruwe has written three novels "Dyeing of Colors", "Alluvial Reflections", "Pearly Gates", and his fourth entitled "Crown Jewels" which is due to be published soon. His first novel "Dyeing of Colors" was published in 2003. The title of the book relates to the triumph of Nigel and Bellamy—two intellectuals of different races working in sync to save the world from nuclear catastrophe. His second novel, "Alluvial Reflections", published in 2004, is Ruwe’s attempt at thriller. Tucker Zulu, educated at Harvard pursues his wife Denise and his once best friend Charles Dibango, who have fled from Boston to Moscow after a DNA paternity test shocker. In 2004, Ruwe went on Leave of Absence from Suffolk University to write his third novel "Pearly Gates", published in 2007. In the novel, the jury finds Fisha Bayu guilty and sends him to death row. As the clock ticks towards his execution, Fisha finds himself at the Pearly Gates. Ruwe’s latest novel "Crown Jewels" is a sequel in which Fisha Bayu takes Queen Elizabeth II to court for colonialism.
Ruwe was educated at the New England Institute of Art and Communications, Suffolk University, Boston, Massachusetts, California State University, Fresno, and Fresno Pacific University, Fresno. He holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Mass Communication and Journalism with a major in Broadcast Journalism and a Master's Degree in History. Currently, he is a PhD candidate. He is a member of the Alpha Delta Pi Society and the Phi Alpha Theta. At California State University, Fresno, he was conferred membership in Kappa Tau Alpha’s National Honor Society in Journalism and Mass Communication. In 2006, Ruwe became a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society an organization that recognizes college students solely on the basis of their academic achievements. Well known honorary members include U.S. President Bill Clinton, General Colin Powell, Astronaut John Glenn and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Ruwe is working on a book entitled “The History of Radio in Southern Africa” which he hopes to later present as a dissertation in his doctorial studies.
Early life.
Ruwe was born in Wusakili Hospital, Kitwe, Zambia, the son of Jeremiah Aaron Ruwe and Rachel Mbizi. He attended Maiteneke Primary School in Chingola. In 1968, he was moved to Chingola Primary School an all-white school. In 1969 he attended high school at Chikola Secondary School, Chingola, and later at Matero Boys’ Secondary School in Lusaka. He was a member of the Chikola Debate Club and the Boys’ Brigade. He sang in the Chiwempala Church Choir and the St. Marks Church Choir.
Career.
In 1975, he entered broadcasting as a Program Operator for Zambia Broadcasting Services, recording radio programs. The following year, Ruwe devised a television sketch show called "Tiyende Pamodzi Comedy Show", based on the BBC format of "The Two Ronnies", a comedy show aired on Television Zambia in the early seventies, featuring the double act of Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett. Ruwe (Thinron) paired with Thomas Shoniwa (Fatson) to create the locally produced English comedy program that quickly became one of the most successful running entertainment programs on Television Zambia. The show, revolving around Ruwe’s ‘thinness’ and Shoniwa’s ‘fatness,’ and featuring local and international guest stars, was produced weekly between 1976 and 1978. The show always opened at the news desk, which featured Ruwe and Shoniwa as newsreaders, reading spoof news items. There was also a cabaret musician or group appearing as a special guest.
Ruwe’s first time to host a radio show was in 1977 when he took over the presentation of “Sanyo Hit Parade” from Humphrey Mapoma. Known by the listeners as “Captain of the Air,” Ruwe featured an eclectic selection of whatever sort of music struck his fancy. He began to get deluged with mail from listeners who asked him to play their favorite songs. So, Ruwe ventured into commercial radio production, getting sponsorship from various companies around the country. Lusaka Pharmacy and City Radio became his biggest clients.
In 1978, Ruwe resigned from ZBS and later moved to Nairobi, Kenya, where he produced a comedy show on the Voice of Kenya television entitled “Come What May,” featuring himself as the disastrous-prone ‘Dafurao.’ The program was a sketch show crossed with a sitcom. It also included a duo of him and Rashpal Panesar reading a spoof of news. It is believed that Ruwe was the first to introduce locally produced English comedy on the Voice of Kenya. Ruwe also performed radio continuity duties, narrated various scripted programs and compiled/presented “Jazz Hour.”
BBC Club.
Ruwe returned to Zambia in 1982. In the same year, he was sponsored by The British Council to study television production at the BBC Open University in Milton Keynes, England and became a member of the BBC Club.
Private sector.
Upon completion of the course, he returned home and in 1983 teamed up with Zambia’s prolific actress Mathilda Malamamfumu Tutu to form Rutu Advertising Agency. A service business dedicated to creating, planning and handling advertising and other forms of promotion for local businesses in Zambia. Their immediate hit was “Secretary of the Year” contest, which was launched in August 1984. The contest featured top-flight secretaries drawn from different parts of the country and drew interest from the private sector and parastatal organizations including the Bank of Zambia. In 1985, Ruwe and his partner acquired copies of the movie "Love Brewed in an African Pot" directed by Ghanaian film maker Akwa Ansah which they showed around the country. In the same year, Ruwe wrote his first book, "Have A Good Laugh", a compilation of jokes from different parts of the world. The book sold well in Zambia, Botswana, and South Africa.
In 1986, Ruwe and Tutu split. Rutu became Rute Advertising (‘te’ drawn from his daughter Thembinkosi). Between 1986 and 1990 Ruwe scripted and hosted various radio and television programs which included “Money Matters” by the Bank of Zambia, “The Road” a production of the National Roads Board and the World Bank, “Zamseed Radio Program” by Zambia Seed Company, “DBZ of the Air” by the Development Bank of Zambia, and more than twenty companies under the auspices of INDECO group of companies. Television programs included “The Tourist” by Zambia National Tourist Board, and various sponsored musicals. During the first Zambia Annual Broadcasting Awards Ceremony, held in Lusaka on December 29, 1989, Ruwe was presented “The Best Disc Jockey of the Year” for all radio channels award, thereby being recognized as the best radio DJ in the country.
From 1990 to 1995, Ruwe operated his own car hire (Rute Car Hire) firm with a fleet of eleven cars and one bus. Ruwe was also known to feature at state functions, dinners and weddings as Master of Ceremonies (ringmaster), often bringing humor and fun to the occasion.
Current life.
In 2006, Ruwe hosted a radio program called "The World At Large", on Valley Public Radio, KVPR FM89.3 Fresno and KPRX FM89.1 Bakersfield, California. The program served as a vehicle to share ideas and possible solutions to the myriad of complex issues facing the world of trade. Between June and October 2006, Ruwe interviewed growers, food processors, manufacturers, importers and exporters. Program participants included corporate CEOs, members of Chamber and Commerce, Professors in Agricultural and Business schools, and US government officials in the trade departments.
In 2008, Ruwe, in league with distinguished scholars, Dr. Miles Ishigaki, professor at Fresno State, and Dr. Robert Marquez, scientist and affiliated New Mexico State University professor, created Africa Center (USA) a non-profit, all-inclusive clearinghouse for philanthropists, donors and sympathizers wishing to help African relief efforts and improve the lives of the displaced, impoverished and diseased in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The Center’s programs are in the following broad areas: philanthropy, charity, investment, project development, health, research, education, tourism, emergency response, food security and agriculture, and water resource development.
Personal life.
Ruwe is married to Dr. Mathilda Bwalya Ruwe a Senior Research Scientist with Central California Policy Institute at the Central California Center for Health and Human Services in Fresno, California. He is a father of three children, Thembinkosi, Dalitso and Rachel, and a grandfather of two, Martin and Zoe.

Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas

Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas encompasses the visual artistic traditions of the indigenous peoples of the Americas from ancient times to the present. These include works from South America, Mesoamerica, North America including Greenland, as well as Siberian Yup'ik peoples who have great cultural overlap with Native Alaskan Yup'iks.
Lithic and Archaic stage.
In North America, the Lithic stage or Paleo-Indian period is defined as approximately 18,000–8000 BCE. The period from around 8000–800 BCE is generally referred to as the Archaic period. The production of bannerstones, Projectile point, Lithic reduction styles and pictographic cave paintings are some of the art that remains from this time period.
Belonging in the Lithic stage, the oldest known art in the Americas is a carved megafauna bone, possibly from a mammoth, etched with a profile of walking mammoth or mastodon that dates back to 11,000 BCE. The bone was found early in the 21st century near Vero Beach, Florida, in an area where human bones (Vero man) had been found in association with extinct pleistocene animals early in the 20th century. The bone is too mineralized to be dated, but the carving has been authenticated as having been made before the bone became mineralized. The anatomical correctness of the carving and the heavy mineralization of the bone indicate that the carving was made while mammoths and/or mastodons still lived in the area, more than 10,000 years ago.
The oldest known painted object in North American is the Cooper Bison Skull from 10,900–10,200 BCE. Lithic age art in South America includes Monte Alegre culture rock paintings created at Caverna da Pedra Pintada dating back to 9250–8550 BCE. Guitarrero Cave in Peru has the earliest known textiles in South America, dating to 8000 BCE.
The southwestern United States and certain regions of the Andes have the highest concentration of pictographs (painted images) and Petroglyphs (carved images) from this period. Both pictographs and petroglyphs are known as rock art.
North America.
Arctic.
The Yupik of Alaska have a long tradition of carving masks for use in shamanic rituals. Indigenous peoples of the Canadian arctic have produced objects that could be classified as art since the time of the Dorset culture. While the walrus ivory carvings of the Dorset were primarily shamanic, the art of the Thule people who replaced them c. 1000 CE was more decorative in character. With European contact the historic period of Inuit art began. In this period, which reached its height in the late 19th century, Inuit artisans created souvenirs for the crews of whaling ships and explorers. Common examples include cribbage boards. Modern Inuit art began in the late 1940s, when with the encouragement of the Canadian government they began to produce prints and serpentine sculptures for sale in the south.
Greenlandic Inuit, or Kalaallit have a unique textile tradition intregrating skin-sewing, furs, and appliqué of small pieces of brightly dyed marine mammal organs. Women create elaborate netted beadwork collars. They have strong mask-making tradition and also are known for an art form called "tupilaq" or an "evil spirit object." Traditional art making practices thrive in the Ammassalik. Sperm whale ivory remains a valued medium for carving.
Subarctic.
Cultures of interior Alaska and Canada living south of the Arctic Circle are Subarctic peoples. While humans have lived in the region far longer, the oldest known surviving Subartic art is a petroglyph site in northwest Ontario, dated to 5000 BCE. Caribou, and to a lesser extent moose, are major resources, providing hides, antlers, sinew, and other artistic materials. Porcupine quillwork embellishes hides and birchbark. After European contact with the influence of the Grey Nuns, moosehair tufting and floral glass beadwork became popular through the Subarctic.
Northwest Coast.
The art of the Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian and other smaller tribes living in the coastal areas of Washington State, Oregon, and British Columbia, is characterized by an extremely complex stylistic vocabulary expressed mainly in the medium of woodcarving. Famous examples include Totem poles, Transformation masks, and canoes.
Eastern Woodlands.
Northeastern Woodlands.
The Eastern Woodlands, or simply woodlands, cultures inhabited the regions of North America east of the Mississippi River at least since 2500 BCE. While there were many regionally distinct cultures, trade between them was common and they shared the practice of burying their dead in earthen mounds, which has preserved a large amount of their art. Because of this trait the cultures are collectively known as the Mound builders.
The Woodland Period (1000 BCE–1000 CE) is divided into early, middle, and late periods, and consisted of cultures that relied mostly on hunting and gathering for their subsistence. Ceramics made by the Deptford culture (2500 BCE-100 CE) are the earliest evidence of an artistic tradition in this region. The Adena culture are another well-known example of an early Woodland culture. They carved stone tablets with zoomorphic designs, created pottery, and fashioned costumes from animal hides and antlers for ceremonial rituals. Shellfish was a mainstay of their diet, and engraved shells have been found in their burial mounds.
The Middle Woodland Period was dominated by cultures of the Hopewell tradition (200-500). Their artwork encompassed a wide variety of jewelry and sculpture in stone, wood, and even human bone.
The Late Woodland Period (500-1000 CE) saw a decline in trade and in the size of settlements, and the creation of art likewise declined.
From the 12th century onward, the Iroquois and nearby coastal tribes fashioned wampum from shells and string; these were mnenomic devices, currency, and records of treaties.
Iroquois people carve False Face masks for healing rituals, but the traditional representatives of the tribes, the Grand Council of the Haudenosaunee, are clear that these masks are not for sale or public display. The same can be said for Iroquois Corn Husk Society masks.
Southeastern Woodlands.
The Poverty Point culture inhabited portions of the state of Louisiana from 2000–1000 BCE during the Archaic period. Many objects excavated at Poverty Point sites were made of materials that originated in distant places, including chipped stone projectile points and tools, ground stone plummets, gorgets and vessels, and shell and stone beads. Stone tools found at Poverty Point were made from raw materials which originated in the relatively nearby Ouachita and Ozark Mountains and from the much further away Ohio and Tennessee River valleys. Vessels were made from soapstone which came from the Appalachian foothills of Alabama and Georgia. Hand-modeled lowly fired clay objects occur in a variety of shapes including anthropomophic figurines and cooking balls.
The Mississippian culture flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States from approximately 800 CE to 1500 CE, varying regionally. After adopting maize agriculture the Mississippian culture became fully agrarian, as opposed to the hunting and gathering supplemented by part-time agriculture practiced by preceding woodland cultures. They built platform mounds larger and more complex than those of their predecessors, and finished and developed more advanced ceramic techniques, commonly using ground mussel shell as a tempering agent. Many were involved with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, a pan-regional and pan-linguistic religious and trade network. The majority of the information known about the S.E.C.C. is derived from examination of the elaborate artworks left behind by its participants, including pottery, shell gorgets and cups, stone statuary, copper plates such as the Wulfing cache and Long-nosed god maskettes. By the time of European contact the Mississippian societies were already experiencing severe social stress, and with the social upsets and diseases introduced by Europeans many of the societies collapsed and ceased to practice a Mississippian lifestyle, with an exception being the Natchez people. Other tribes descended from Mississippian cultures include the Caddo, Choctaw, Muscogee Creek, Wichita, and many other southeastern peoples.
A large number of pre-Columbian wooden artifacts have been found in Florida. While the oldest wooden artifacts are as much as 10,000 years old, carved and painted wooden objects are known only from the past 2,000 years. Animal effigies and face masks have been found at a number of sites in Florida. Animal effigies dating to between 200 and 600 were found in a mortuary pond at Fort Center, on the west side of Lake Okeechobee. Particularly impressive is a 66 cm tall carving of an eagle.
More than 1,000 carved and painted wooden objects, including masks, tablets, plaques and effigies, were excavated in 1896 at Key Marco, in southwestern Florida. They have been described as some of the finest prehistoric native American art in North America. The objects are not well dated, but may belong to the first millienium of the current era. Spanish missionaries described similar masks and effigies in use by the Calusa late in the 17th century, and at the former Tequesta site on the Miami River in 1743, although no examples of the Calusa objects from the historic period have survived. A south Florida effigy style is known from wooden and bone carvings from various sites in the Belle Glade, Caloosahatchee, and Glades culture areas.
The Seminoles are best known for their textile creations, especially patchwork clothing. Doll-making is another notable craft.
The West.
Great Plains.
Tribes have lived on the Great Plains for thousands of years. Early Plains cultures are commonly divided into four periods: Paleoindian (at least c. 10,000–4000 BCE), Plains Archaic (c. 4000–250 BCE), Plains Woodland (c. 250 BCE–950 CE), Plains Village (c. 950-1850 CE). The oldest known painted object in North American was found in the southern plains, the Cooper Bison Skull, found in Oklahoma and dated 10,900-10,200 BCE. It's painted with a red zizzag.
In the Plains Village period, the cultures of the area settled in enclosed clusters of rectangular houses and cultivated maize. Various regional differences emerged, including Southern Plains, Central Plains, Oneota, and Middle Missouri. Tribes were both nomadic hunters and semi-nomadic farmers. During the "Plains Coalescent period" (1400-European contact) some change, possibly drought, caused the mass migration of the population to the Eastern Woodlands region, and the Great Plains were sparsely populated until pressure from American settlers drove tribes into the area again.
The advent of the horse revolutionized the cultures of many historical Plains tribes. Horse culture enabled tribes to live a completely nomadic existence, hunting buffalo. Buffalo hide clothing was decorated with porcupine quill embroidery and beads – dentalium shells and elk teeth were prized materials. Later coins and glass beads acquired from trading were incorporated into Plains art. Plains beadwork has flourished into contemporary times.
Buffalo was the preferred material for Plains hide painting. Men painted narrative, pictorial designs recording personal exploits or visions. They also painted pictographic historical calendars known as Winter counts. Women painted geometric designs on tanned robes and rawhide parfleches, which sometimes served as maps.
During the Reservation Era of the late 19th century, buffalo herds were systematically destroyed by non-native hunters. Due to the scarcity of hides, Plains artists adopted new painting surfaces, such as muslin or paper, giving birth to Ledger art, so named for the ubiquitous ledger books used by Plains artists.
Great Basin and Plateau.
Since the archaic period the Plateau region, also known as the Intermontaine and upper Great Basin, had been a center of trade. Plateau people traditionally settled near major river systems. Because of this, their art carries influences from other regions – from the Pacific Northwest coasts and Great Plains. Nez Perce, Yakama, Umatilla, and Cayuse women weave flat, rectangular corn husks or hemp dogbane bags, which are decorated with "bold, geometric designs" in false embroidery. Plateau beadworkers are known for their contour-style beading and their elaborate horse regalia.
Great Basin tribes have a sophisticated basket making tradition, as exemplified by Louisa Keyser (Washoe), Lucy Telles, Carrie Bethel and Nellie Charlie. After being displaced from their lands by non-Native settlers, Washoe wove baskets for the commodity market, especially 1895 to 1935. Paiute, Shoshone and Washoe basketmakers are known for their baskets that incorporate seed beads on the surface and for waterproof baskets.
California.
The Native Americans in California have a tradition of exquisitely detailed basket weaving arts. In the late 19th-century Californian baskets by artists in the Cahuilla, Chumash, Pomo, Miwok, Hupa and many other tribes became popular with collectors, museums, and tourists. This resulted in great innovation in the form of the baskets. Many pieces by Native American basket weavers from all parts of California are in museum collections, such as the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University, the Southwest Museum, and the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of the American Indian.
California has a large number of pictographs and petroglyphs rock art. One of the largest densities of petroglyphs in North America, by the Coso People, is in Big and Little Petroglyph Canyons in the Coso Rock Art District of the northern Mojave Desert in California.
The most elaborate pictographs in the U.S are considered to be the rock art of the Chumash people, found in cave paintings in present day Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo Counties. The Chumash cave painting includes examples at Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park and Burro Flats Painted Cave.
Southwest.
In the Southwestern United States numerous pictographs and petroglyphs were created. The Fremont culture and Ancient Pueblo Peoples and later tribes' creations, in the Barrier Canyon Style and others, are seen at present day Buckhorn Draw Pictograph Panel and Horseshoe Canyon, amongst other sites. Petroglyphs by these and the Mogollon culture's artists are represented in Dinosaur National Monument and at Newspaper Rock.
The Ancestral Pueblo, or Anasazi, (1000 BCE–700 CE) are the ancestors of today's Pueblo tribes. Their culture formed in the American southwest, after the cultivation of corn was introduced from Mexico around 1200 BCE. People of this region developed an agrarian lifestyle, cultivating food, storage gourds, and cotton with irrigation or xeriscaping techniques. They lived in sedentary towns, so pottery, used to store water and grain, was ubiquitous.
For hundreds of years, Ancestral Pueblo created utilitarian grayware and black-on-white pottery and occasionally orange or red ceramics. In historical times, Hopi created ollas, dough bowls, and food bowls of different sizes for daily use, but they also made more elaborate ceremonial mugs, jugs, ladles, seed jars and those vessels for ritual use, and these were usually finished with polished surfaces and decorated with black painted designs. At the turn of the 20th century, Hopi potter Nampeyo famous revived Sikyatki-style pottery, originated on First Mesa in the 14th to 17th centuries.
Southwest architecture includes Cliff dwellings, multi-story settlements carved from living rock; pit houses; and adobe and sandstone pueblos. One of the most elaborate and largest ancient settlements is Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, which includes 15 major complexes of sandstone and timber. These are connected by a network of roads. Construction for the largest of these settlements, Pueblo Bonito, began 1080 years before present. Pueblo Bonito contains over 800 rooms.
Turquoise, jet, and spiny oyster shell have been traditionally used by Ancestral Pueblo for jewelry, and they developed sophisticated inlay techniques centuries ago.
Around 200 CE the Hohokam culture developed in Arizona. They are the ancestors of the Tohono O'odham and Akimel O'odham or Pima tribes. The Mimbres, a subgroup of the Mogollon culture, are especially notable for the narrative paintings on their pottery.
Within the last millennium, Athabaskan peoples emigrated from northern Canada in the southwest. These include the Navajo and Apache. Sandpainting is an aspect of Navajo healing ceremonies that inspired an art form. Navajos learned to weave on upright looms from Pueblos and wove blankets that were eagerly collected by Great Basin and Plains tribes in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the introduction of the railroad in the 1880s, imported blankets became plentiful and inexpensive, so Navajo weavers switched to producing rugs for trade.
In the 1850s, Navajos adopted silversmithing from the Mexicans. Atsidi Sani (Old Smith) was the first Navajo silversmith, but he had many students, and the technology quickly spread to surrounding tribes. Today thousands of artists produce silver jewelry with turquoise. Hopi are renowned for their overlay silver work and cottonwood carvings. Zuni artists are admired for their cluster work jewelry, showcasing turquoise designs, as well as their elaborate, pictorial stone inlay in silver.
Mesoamerica and Central America.
The cultural development of ancient Mesoamerica was generally divided along east and west. The stable Maya culture was most dominant in the east, especially the Yucatán Peninsula, while in the west more varied developments took place in subregions. These included West Mexican (1000-1), Teotihuacan (1-500), Mixtec (1000–1200), and Aztec (1200-1521).
Central American civilizations generally lived to the regions south of modern-day Mexico, although there was some overlap.
Mesoamerica.
Mesoamerica was home to the following cultures, among others:
Olmec.
The Olmec (1500-400 BCE), who lived on the gulf coast, were the first civilization to fully develop in Mesoamerica. Their culture was the first to develop many traits that remained constant in Mesoamerica until the last days of the Aztecs: a complex astronomical calendar, the ritual practice of a ball game, and the erection of stelae to commemorate victories or other important events.
The most famous artistic creations of the Olmec are colossal basalt heads, believed to be portraits of rulers that were erected to advertise their great power. The Olmec also sculpted votive figurines that they buried beneath the floors of their houses for unknown reasons. These were most often modeled in terracotta, but also occasionally carved from jade or serpentine.
Teotihuacano.
Teotihuacan was a city built in the Valley of Mexico, containing some of the largest pyramidal structures built in the pre-Columbian Americas. Established around 200 BCE, the city fell between the 7th and 8th century CE. Teotihuacan has numerous well-preserved murals.
Classic Veracruz Culture.
In his 1957 book on Mesoamerican art, Miguel Covarrubias speaks of Remojadas' "magnificent hollow figures with expressive faces, in majestic postures and wearing elaborate paraphernalia indicated by added clay elements."<br>
Zapotec.
"The Bat God was one of the important deities of the Maya, many elements of whose religion were shared also by the Zapotec. The Bat God in particular is known to have been revered also by the Zapotec [...] He was especially associated [...] with the underworld." An important Zapotec center was Monte Alban, in present-day Oaxaca, Mexico. The Monte Alban periods are divided into I, II, and III, which range from 200 BCE to 600 CE.
Maya.
The Maya civilization occupied the south of Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador.
Central America and "Intermediate area".
Greater Chiriqui
Greater Nicoya
The ancient peoples of the Nicoya Peninsula in present day Costa Rica traditionally sculpted birds in jade, which were used for funeral ornaments. Around 500 CE gold ornaments replaced jade, possibly because of the depletion of jade resources.
South American.
The native civilizations were most developed in the Andean region, where they are roughly divided into Northern Andes civilizations of present- day Colombia and Ecuador and the Southern Andes civilizations of present- day Peru and Chilé.
Hunter-gatherer tribes throughout the Amazon rainforest of Brazil also have developed artistic traditions involving tattooing and body painting. Because of their remoteness, these tribes and their art have not been studied as thoroughly as Andean cultures, and many even remain uncontacted.
Amazonia.
Traditionally limited in access to stone and metals, Amazonian indigenous peoples excel at featherwork, painting, textiles, and ceramics. Caverna da Pedra Pintada (Cave of the Painted Rock) in the Pará state of Brazil houses the oldest firmly dated art in the Americas – rock paintings dating back 11,000 years. The cave is also the site of the oldest ceramics in the Americas, from 5000 BCE.
The Island of Marajó, at the mouth of the Amazon River was a major center of ceramic traditions as early as 1000 CE and continues to produce ceramics today, characterized by cream-colored bases painted with linear, geometric designs of red, black, and white slips.
With access to a wide range of native bird species, Amazonian indigenous peoples excel at feather work, creating brilliant colored headdresses, jewelry, clothing, and fans. Iridescent beetle wings are incorporated into earrings and other jewelry. Weaving and basketry also thrive in the Amazon, as noted among the Urarina of Peru.
Modern and contemporary.
Beginnings of contemporary Native American art.
Pinpointing the exact time of emergence of "modern" and contemporary Native art is problematic. In the past, Western art historians have considered use of Western art media or exhibiting in international art arena as criteria for "modern" Native American art history. Native American art history is a new and highly contested academic discipline, and these Eurocentric benchmarks are followed less and less today. Many media considered appropriate for easel art were employed by Native artists for centuries, such as stone and wood sculpture and mural painting. Ancestral Pueblo artists painted with tempera on woven cotton fabric, at least 800 years ago. Certain Native artists used non-Indian art materials as soon as they became available. For example, Texcocan artist Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl painted with ink and watercolor on paper in the late 16th century. Bound together in the Codex Ixtlilxochitl, these portraits of historical Texcocan leaders are rendered with shading, modeling and anatomic accuracy. The Cuzco School of Peru featured Quechua easel painters in the 17th and 18th centuries. The first cabinets of curiosities in the 16th century, precursors to modern museums, featured Native American art.
It should be noted that the notion that fine art cannot be functional has not gained widespread acceptance in the Native American art world, as evidenced by the high esteem and value placed upon rugs, blankets, basketry, weapons, and other utilitarian items in Native American art shows. A dichotomy between fine art and craft is not commonly found in contemporary Native art. For example, the Cherokee Nation honors its greatest artists as Living Treasures, including frog- and fish-gig makers, flint knappers, and basket weavers, alongside sculptors, painters, and textile artists. Art historian Dawn Ades writes, "For from being inferior, or purely decorative, crafts like textiles or ceramics, have always had the possibility of being the bearers of vital knowledge, beliefs and myths."
Recognizable art markets between Natives and non-Natives emerged upon contact, but the 1820-1840s were a highly prolific time. In the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes region, tribes dependent upon the rapidly diminishing fur trade adopted art production a means of financial support. A painting movement known as the Iroquois Realist School emerged among the Haudenosaunee in New York in the 1820s, spearheaded by the brothers David and Dennis Cusick.
African-Ojibwe sculptor, Edmonia Lewis maintained a studio in Rome, Italy and carved Neoclassicist marble sculptors from the 1860s-1880s. Her mother belonged to the Mississauga band of the Credit River Indian Reserve. Lewis exhibited widely, and a testament to her popularity during her own time was that President Ulysses S. Grant commissioned her to carve his portrait in 1877.
Ho-Chunk artist, Angel DeCora was the best known Native American artist before World War I. She was taken from her reservation and family to the Hampton Institute, where she began her lengthy formal art training. Active in the Arts and Crafts Movement, DeCora exhibited her paintings and design widely and illustrated books by Native authors. She strove to be tribally specific in her work and was revolutionary for portraying Indians in contemporary clothing of the early 20th century. She taught art to young Native students at Carlisle Indian Industrial School and was an outspoken advocate of art as a means for Native Americans to maintain cultural pride, while finding a place in mainstream society.
The Kiowa Five or Kiowa Six, a group of Kiowa painters from Oklahoma, met with international success when their mentor, Oscar Jacobson, showed their paintings in First International Art Exposition in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1928. They also participated in the 1932 Venice Biennale, where their art display, according to Dorothy Dunn, “was acclaimed the most popular exhibit among all the rich and varied displays assembled.”
The Santa Fe Indian Market began in 1922. John Collier became Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1933 and temporarily reversed the BIA's assimilationist policies by encouraging Native American arts and culture. By this time, Native American art exhibits and the art market increased, gaining wider audiences. In the 1920s and 30s, Indigenist art movements flourished in Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Mexico, most famously with the Mexican Muralist movements.
Basketry.
Basket weaving is one of the ancient and most-widespread art forms in the Americas. From coiled sea lyme grass baskets in Nunavut to bark baskets in Tierra del Fuego, Native artists weave baskets from a wide range of materials. Typically baskets are made of vegetable fibers, but Tohono O'odham are known for their horsehair baskets and Inupiaq artists weave baskets from baleen, filtering plates of certain whales. Grand Traverse Band Kelly Church, Wasco-Wishram Pat Gold, and Eastern Band Cherokee Joel Queen all weave baskets from copper sheets or wire, and Mi'kmaq-Onondaga conceptual artist Gail Tremblay weaves baskets in the traditional fancywork patterns of her tribes from exposed film. Basketry can take many forms. Haida artist Lisa Telford uses cedar bark to weave both traditional functional baskets and impractical but beautiful cedar evening gowns and high-heeled shoes.
A range of native grasses provides material for Arctic baskets, as does baleen, which is a 20th-century development. Baleen baskets are typically embellished with walrus ivory carvings. Cedar bark is often used in northwest coastal baskets. Throughout the Great Lakes and northeast, black ash and sweetgrass are woven into fancy work, featuring "porcupine" points, or decorated as strawberries. Bark baskets are traditional for gathering berries. Rivercane is the preferred material in the Southeast, and Chitimachas are regarded as the finest rivercane weavers. In Oklahoma, rivercane is prized but rare so baskets are typically made of honeysuckle or buckbrush runners. Coiled baskets are popular in the southwest and the Hopi and Apache in particular are known for pictorial coiled basketry plaques. The Tohono O'odham are well known for their basket-weaving prowess, and evidenced by the success of Annie Antone and Terrol Dew Johnson.
California and Great Basin tribes are considered some of the finest basket weavers in the world. Juncus is a common material in southern California, while sedge, willow, redbud, and devil's claw are also used. Pomo basket weavers are known to weave 60-100 stitches per inch and their rounded, coiled baskets adorned with quail's topknots, feathers, abalone, and clamshell discs are known as "treasure baskets." Three of the most celebrated Californian basket weavers were Elsie Allen (Pomo), Laura Somersal (Wappo), and the late Pomo-Patwin medicine woman, Mabel McKay, known for her biography, "Weaving the Dream". Louisa Keyser was a highly influential Washoe basket weaver.
A complex technique called "doubleweave," which involves continuously weaving both an inside and outside surface is shared by the Choctaw, Cherokee, Chitimacha, Tarahumara, and Venezuelan tribes. Mike Dart, Cherokee Nation, is a contemporary practitioner of this technique. The Tarahumara, or Raramuri, of Copper Canyon, Mexico typically weave with pine needles and sotol. In Panama, Embera-Wounaan peoples are renowned for their pictoral chunga palm baskets, known as "hösig di", colored in vivid full-spectrum of natural dyes.
Yanomamo basket weavers of the Venezuelan Amazon paint their woven tray and burden baskets with geometric designs in charcoal and "onto", a red berry. While in most tribes the basket weavers are often women, among the Waura tribe in Brazil, men weave baskets. They weave a wide range of styles, but the largest are called "mayaku", which can be two feet wide and feature tight weaves with an impressive array of designs.
Today basket weaving often leads to environmental activism. Indiscriminate pesticide spraying endangers basket weavers' health. The black ash tree, used by basket weavers from Michigan to Maine, is threatened by the emerald ash borer. Basket weaver Kelly Church has organized two conferences about the threat and teaches children how to harvest black ash seeds. Many native plants that basket weavers use are endangered. Rivercane only grows in 2% of its original territory. Cherokee basket weaver and ethnobotanist, Shawna Cain is working with her tribe to form the Cherokee Nation Native Plant Society. Tohono O'odham basket weaver Terrol Dew Johnson, known for his experimental use of gourds, beargrass, and other desert plants, took his interest in native plants and founded Tohono O'odham Community Action, which provides traditional wild desert foods for his tribe.
Beadwork.
Beadwork is a quintessentially Native American art form, but ironically uses beads imported from Europe and Asia. Glass beads have been in use for almost five centuries in the Americas. Today a wide range of beading styles flourish.
In the Great Lakes, Ursuline nuns introduced floral patterns to tribes, who quickly applied them to beadwork. Great Lakes tribes are known for their bandolier bags, that might take an entire year to complete. During the 20th century the Plateau tribes, such as the Nez Perce perfected contour-style beadwork, in which the lines of beads are stitch to emphasize the pictorial imagery. Plains tribes are master beaders, and today dance regalia for man and women feature a variety of beadwork styles. While Plains and Plateau tribes are renowned for their beaded horse trappings, Subarctic tribes such as the Dene bead lavish floral dog blankets. Eastern tribes have a completely different beadwork aesthetic, and Innu, Mi'kmaq, Penobscot, and Haudenosaunee tribes are known for symmetrical scroll motifs in white beads, called the "double curve." Iroquois are also known for "embossed" beading in which strings pulled taut force beads to pop up from the surface, creating a bas-relief. Tammy Rahr (Cayuga) is a contemporary practitioner of this style. Zuni artists have developed a tradition of three-dimensional beaded sculptures.
Huichol Indians of Jalisco and Nayarit, Mexico have a completely unique approach to beadwork. They adhere beads, one by one, to a surface, such as wood or a gourd, with a mixture of resin and beeswax.
Most Native beadwork is created for tribal use but beadworkers also create conceptual work for the art world. Richard Aitson (Kiowa-Apache) has both an Indian and non-Indian audience for his work and is known for his fully beaded cradleboards. Another Kiowa beadworker, Teri Greeves has won top honors for her beadwork, which consciously integrates both traditional and contemporary motifs, such as beaded dancers on Converse high-tops. Greeves also beads on buckskin and explores such issues as warfare or Native American voting rights.
Marcus Amerman, Choctaw, one of today's most celebrated bead artists, pioneered a movement of highly realistic beaded portraits. His imagery ranges from 19th century Native leaders to pop icons such as Janet Jackson and Brooke Shields.
Roger Amerman, Marcus' brother, and Martha Berry, Cherokee, have effectively revived Southeastern beadwork, a style that had been lost because of forced removal from tribes to Indian Territory. Their beadwork commonly features white bead outlines, an echo of the shell beads or pearls Southeastern tribes used before contact.
Jamie Okuma (Luiseño-Shoshone-Bannock) was won top awards with her beaded dolls, which can include entire families or horses and riders, all with fully beaded regalia. The antique Venetian beads she uses can as small as size 22°, about the size of a grain of salt. Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty, Rhonda Holy Bear, and Charlene Holy Bear are also prominent beaded dollmakers.
The widespread popularity of glass beads does not mean aboriginal bead making is dead. Perhaps the most famous Native bead is wampum, a cylindrical tube of quahog or whelk shell. Both shells produce white beads, but only parts of the quahog produce purple. These are ceremonially and politically important to a range of Northeastern Woodland tribes. Elizabeth James Perry (Aquinnah Wampanoag-Eastern Band Cherokee) creates wampum jewelry today, including wampum belts.
Ceramics.
Ceramics have been created in the Americas for the last 8000 years, as evidenced by pottery found in Caverna da Pedra Pintada in the heart of the Brazilian Amazon. The Island of Marajó in Brazil remains a major center of ceramic art today. In Mexico, Mata Ortiz pottery continues the ancient Casas Grandes tradition of polychrome pottery. Juan Quezada is one of the leading potters from Mata Ortiz.
In the Southeast, the Catawba tribe is known for its tan-and-black mottled pottery. Eastern Band Cherokees' pottery has Catawba influences. In Oklahoma, Cherokees lost their pottery traditions until revived by Anna Belle Sixkiller Mitchell. The Caddo tribe's centuries-long pottery tradition had died out in the early 20th century, but has been effectively revived by Jereldine Redcorn.
Pueblo people are particularly known for their ceramic traditions. Nampeyo (c. 1860–1942) was a Hopi potter who collaborated with anthropologists to revive traditional pottery forms and designs, and many of her relatives are successful potters today. Maria and Julian Martinez, both San Ildefonso Pueblo revived their tribe's blackware tradition in the early 20th century. Julian invented a gloss-matte blackware style for which his tribe is still known today. Lucy Lewis (1898–1992) of Acoma Pueblo gained recognition for her black-on-white ceramics in the mid-20th century. Cochiti Pueblo was known for its grotesque figurines at the turn-of-the-20th century, and these have been revived by Virgil Ortiz. Cochiti potter Helen Cordero (1915–1994) invented storyteller figures, which feature a large, single figure of a seated elder telling stories to groups of smaller figures.
While northern potters are not as well known as their southern counterparts, ceramic arts extend as far north as the Arctic. Inuit potter, Makituk Pingwartok of Cape Dorset uses a pottery wheel to create her prizewinning ceramics.
Today contemporary Native potters create a wide range of ceramics from functional pottery to monumental ceramic sculpture. Roxanne Swentzell of Santa Clara Pueblo is one of the leading ceramic artists in the Americas. She creates coil-built, emotionally-charged figures that comment on contemporary society. Nora Naranjo-Morse, also of Santa Clara Pueblo is world renowned for her individual figures as well as conceptual installations featuring ceramics. Diego Romero of Cochiti Pueblo is known for his ceramic bowls, painted with satirical scenes that combine Ancestral Pueblo, Greek, and pop culture imagery. Hundreds more Native contemporary ceramic artists are taking pottery in new directions.
Performance art.
Performance art is a new art form, emerging in the 1960s, and so does not carry the cultural baggage of many other art genres. Performance art can draw upon storytelling traditions, as well as music and dance, and often includes elements of installation, video, film, and textile design. Rebecca Belmore, a Canadian Ojibway performance artist, has represented her country in the prestigious Venice Biennale. James Luna, a Luiseño-Mexican performance artist, also participated in the Venice Biennale in 2005, representing the National Museum of the American Indian.
Performance allows artists to confront their audience directly, challenge long held stereotypes, and bring up current issues, often in an emotionally charged manner. "just howl in their seats, and there's ranting and booing or hissing, carrying on the in the audience," says Rebecca Belmore of the response to her work. She has created performances to call attention to violence against and many unsolved murders of First Nations women. Both Belmore and Luna create elaborate, often outlandish outfits and props for their performances and move through a range of characters. For instance, a repeating character of Luna's is Uncle Jimmy, a disabled veteran who criticizes greed and apathy on his reservation. On the other hand, Marcus Amerman, a Choctaw performance artist, maintains a consistent role of the Buffalo Man, whose irony and social commentary arise from the odd situations in which he finds himself, for instance a James Bond movie or lost in a desert labyrinth.
Erica Lord, Inupiaq-Athabaskan, explores her mixed-race identity and conflicts about the ideas of home through her performance art. In her words, "In order to sustain a genuine self, I create a world in which I shift to become one or all of my multiple visions of self." She has suntanned phrases into her skin, donned cross-cultural and cross-gender disguises, and incorporated songs, ranging from Inupiaq throat singing to racist children's rhymes into her work.
A Bolivian anarcha-feminist cooperative, Mujeres Creando or "Women Creating" features many indigenous artists. They create public performances or street theater to bring attention to issues of women's, indigenous people's, and lesbian's rights, as well as anti-poverty issues. Julieta Paredes, María Galindo and Mónica Mendoza are founding members.
Performance art has allowed Native Americans access to the international art world, and Rebecca Belmore mentions that her audiences are non-Native; however, Native American audiences also respond to this genre. "Bringing It All Back Home," a 1997 film collaboration between James Luna and Chris Eyre, documents Luna's first performance at his own home, the La Jolla Indian Reservation. Luna describes the experience as "probably the scariest moment of my life as an artist ... performing for the members of my reservation in the tribal hall."
Photography.
Native Americans embraced photography in the 19th century. Some even owned their own photography studios, such as Benjamin Haldane (1874–1941), Tsimshian of Metlakatla Village on Annette Island, Alaska, Jennie Ross Cobb (1881–1959), Cherokee Nation of Park Hill, Oklahoma, and Richard Throssel (1882–1933), Cree of Montana. Their early photographs stand in stark contrast to the romanticized images of Edward Curtis and other contemporaries. Recent scholarship by Mique’l Askren (Tsimshian/Tlingit) on the photographs of B.A. Haldane has analyzed the functions that Haldane's photographs served for his community: as markers of success by having Anglo-style formal portraits taken, and as markers of the continuity of potlaching and traditional ceremonials by having photographs taken in ceremonial regalia. This second category is particularly significant because the use of the ceremonial regalia was against the law in Canada between 1885-1951.
Martín Chambi (1891–1973), a Quechua photographer from Peru, was one of the pioneering indigenous photographers of South America. Peter Pitseolak (1902–1973), Inuit from Cape Dorset, Nunavut, documented Inuit life in the mid-20th century while dealing with challenges presented by the harsh climate and extreme light conditions of the Canadian Arctic. He developed his film himself in his igloo, and some of his photos were shot by oil lamps. Horace Poolaw (1906–1984), Kiowa, shot over 2000 images of his neighbors and relatives in Western Oklahoma from the 1920s onward. Jean Fredericks (b. 1906), Hopi, had to carefully negotiate cultural views towards photography and made a point of not offering his portraits of Hopi people for sale to the public.
Today innumerable Native people are professional art photographers; however, acceptance to the genre has met with challenges. Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie, Navajo-Muscogee-Seminole, has not only established a successful career with her own work, she has also been an advocate for the entire field of Native American photography. She has curated shows and organized conferences at the C.N. Gorman Museum at UC Davis featuring Native American photographers. Tsinhnahjinnie wrote the book, "Our People, Our Land, Our Images: International Indigenous Photographers." Native photographers taking their skills into the fields of art videography, photocollage, digital photography, and digital art.
Printmaking.
Although it is widely speculated that the ancient Adena stone tablets were used for printmaking, not much is known about aboriginal American printmaking. 20th-century Native artists have borrowed techniques from Japan and Europe, such as woodcut, linocut, serigraphy, monotyping, and other practices.
Printmaking has flourished among Inuit communities in particular. European-Canadian James Houston created a graphic art program in Cape Dorset, Nunavut in 1957. Houston taught local Inuit stone carvers how to created prints from stone-blocks and stencils. He asked local artists to draw pictures and the shop generated limited edition prints, based on the ukiyo-e workshop system of Japan. Cooperative print shops were also established in nearby communities, including Baker Lake, Puvirnituq, Holman, and Pangnirtung. These shops have experimented with etching, engraving, lithography, and silkscreen. Shops produced annual catalogs advertising their collections. Local birds and animals, spirit beings, and hunting scenes are the most popular subject matter, but are allegorical in nature. Backgrounds tend to be minimal and perspective is mixed. One of the most prominent of Cape Dorset artists is Kenojuak Ashevak (born 1927), who has received many public commissions and two honorary doctorate degrees. Other prominent Inuit printmakers and graphic artists include Parr, Osuitok Ipeelee, Germaine Arnaktauyok, Pitseolak Ashoona, Tivi Etok, Helen Kalvak, Jessie Oonark, Kananginak Pootoogook, Pudlo Pudlat, Irene Avaalaaqiaq Tiktaalaaq, and Simon Tookoome. Inuit printmaker Andrew Qappik designed the coat of arms of Nunavut.
Many Native painters transformed their paintings into fine art prints. Potawatomi artist Woody Crumbo created bold, screen prints and etchings in the mid-20th century that blended traditional, flat Bacone Style with Art Deco influences. Kiowa-Caddo-Choctaw painter, T.C. Cannon traveled to Japan to study wood block printing from master printers.
In Chile, Mapuche printmaker Santos Chávez (1934–2001) was one of the most celebrated artists of his country – with over 85 solo exhibitions during his lifetime.
Melanie Yazzie (Navajo), Linda Lomahaftewa (Hopi-Choctaw), Fritz Scholder and Debora Iyall (Cowlitz) have all built successful careers with their print and have gone on to teach the next generation of printers. Walla Walla artist, James Lavadour founded Crow's Shadow Institute of the Arts on the Umatilla Reservation in Oregon in 1992. Crow's Shadow features a state-of-the-art printmaking studio and offers workshops, exhibition space, and printmaking residencies for Native artists, in which they pair visiting artists with master printers.
Sculpture.
Native Americans have created sculpture, both monumental and small, for millennia. Stone sculptures are ubiquitous through the Americas, in the forms of stelae, inuksuit, and statues. Alabaster stone carving is popular among Western tribes, where catlinite carving is traditional in the Northern Plains and fetish-carving is traditional in the Southwest, particularly among the Zuni. The Taíno of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic are known for their zemis– sacred, three-pointed stone sculptures.
Inuit artists sculpt with walrus ivory, caribou antlers, bones, soapstone, serpentinite, and argillite. They often represent local fauna and humans engaged in hunting or ceremonial activities.
Edmonia Lewis paved the way for Native American artists to sculpt in mainstream traditions using non-Native materials. Allan Houser (Warms Springs Chiricahua Apache) became one of most prominent Native sculptors of the 20th century. Though he worked in wood and stone, Houser is most known for his monumental bronze sculptors, both representational and abstract. Houser influenced a generation of Native sculptors by teaching at the Institute of American Indian Arts. His two sons, Phillip and Bob Haozous are sculptors today. Roxanne Swentzell (Santa Clara Pueblo) is known for her expressive, figurative, ceramic sculptures but has also branched into bronze casting, and her work is permanently displayed at the National Museum of the American Indian.
The Northwest Coastal tribes are known for their woodcarving – most famously their monumental totem poles that display clan crests. During the 19th century and early 20th century, this art form was threatened but was effectively revived. Kwakwaka'wakw totem pole carvers such as Charlie James, Mungo Martin, Ellen Neel, and Willie Seaweed kept the art alive and also carved masks, furniture, bentwood boxes, and jewelry. Haida carvers include Charles Edenshaw, Bill Reid, and Robert Davidson. Besides working in wood, Haida also work with argillite. Traditional formline designs translate well into glass sculpture, which is increasingly popular thanks to efforts by contemporary glass artists such as Preston Singletary (Tlingit), Susan Point (Coast Salish) and Marvin Oliver (Quinault/Isleta Pueblo).
In the Southeast, woodcarving dominates sculpture. Willard Stone, of Cherokee descent, exhibited internationally in the mid-20th century. Amanda Crowe (Eastern Band Cherokee) studied sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago and returned to her reservation to teach over 2000 students woodcarving over a period of 40 years, ensuring that sculpture thrives as an art form on the Qualla Boundary.
Textiles.
Fiberwork dating back 10,000 years has been unearthed from Guitarrero Cave in Peru. Cotton and wool from alpaca, llamas, and vicuñas have been woven into elaborate textiles for thousands of years in the Andes and are still important parts of Quechua and Aymara culture today. Coroma in Antonio Quijarro Province, Bolivia is a major center for ceremonial textile production. An Aymara elder from Coroma said, "In our sacred weavings are expressions of our philosophy, and the basis for our social organization... The sacred weavings are also important in differentiating one community, or ethnic group, from a neighboring group..."
Kuna tribal members of Panama and Colombia are famous for their molas, cotton panels with elaborate geometric designs created by a reverse appliqué technique. Designs originated from traditional skin painting designs but today exhibit a wide range of influences, including pop culture. Two mola panels form a blouse, but when a Kuna woman is tired of a blouse, she can dissemble it and sell the molas to art collectors.
Mayan women have woven cotton with backstrap looms for centuries, creating items such as "huipils" or traditional blouses. Elaborate Maya textiles featured representations of animals, plants, and figures from oral history. Organizing into weaving collectives have helped Mayan women earn better money for their work and greatly expand the reach of Mayan textiles in the world.
Seminole seamstresses, upon gaining access to sewing machines in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, invented an elaborate appliqué patchwork tradition. Seminole patchwork, for which the tribe is known today, came into full flower in the 1920s.
Great Lakes and Prairie tribes are known for their ribbonwork, found on clothing and blankets. Strips of silk ribbons are cut and appliquéd in layers, creating designs defined by negative space. The colors and designs might reflect the clan or gender of the wearer. Powwow and other dance regalia from these tribes often feature ribbonwork. These tribes are also known for their fingerwoven sashes.
Pueblo men weave with cotton on upright looms. Their mantas and sashes are typically made for ceremonial use for the community, not for outside collectors.
Navajo rugs are woven by Navajo women today from Navajo-Churro sheep or commercial wool. Designs can be pictorial or abstract, based on traditional Navajo, Spanish, Oriental, or Persian designs. 20th-century Navajo weavers include Clara Sherman and Hosteen Klah, who co-founded the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian.
In 1973, the Navajo Studies Department of the Diné College in Many Farms, Arizona, wanted to determine how long it took a Navajo weaver to create a rug or blanket from sheep shearing to market. The study determined the total amount of time was 345 hours. Out of these 345 hours, the expert Navajo weaver needed: 45 hours to shear the sheep and process the wool; 24 hours to spin the wool; 60 hours to prepare the dye and to dye the wool; 215 hours to weave the piece; and only one hour to sell the item in their shop.
Traditional textiles of Northwest Coast tribes are enjoying a dramatic revival. Chilkat weaving and ravenstail weaving are regarded as some of the most difficult weaving techniques in the world. A single Chilkat blanket can take an entire year to weave. In both techniques, dog, mountain goat, or sheep wool and shredded cedar bark are combined to create textiles featuring curvilinear formline designs. Tlingit weaver Jennie Thlunaut (1982–1986) was instrumental in this revival.
Experimental contemporary textile artists include Martha Gradolf (Winnebago), whose work is overtly political in nature. Valencia, Joseph and Ramona Sakiestewa (Hopi) and Melissa Cody (Navajo) explore non-representational abstraction and use experimental materials in their weaving.
Cultural sensitivity and repatriation.
As in most cultures, Native peoples create some works that are to be used only in sacred, private ceremonies. Many sacred objects or items that contain medicine are to be seen or touched by certain individuals with specialized knowledge. Many Pueblo and Hopi katsina figures ("tihü" in Hopi and "kokko" in Zuni) and katsinam regalia are not meant to be seen by individuals who have not received instruction about that particular katsina. Many institutions do not display these publicly out of respect for tribal taboos.
Mide birch bark scrolls are deemed too culturally sensitive for public display, as are medicine bundles, certain sacred pipes and pipe bags, and other tools of medicine people.
Navajo sandpainting is a component for healing ceremonies, but sandpaintings can be made into permanent art that is acceptable to sell to non-Natives as long as Holy People are not portrayed. Various tribes prohibit photography of many sacred ceremonies, as used to be the case in many Western cultures. As several early photographers broke local laws, photographs of sensitive ceremonies are in circulation, but tribes prefer that they not be displayed. The same can be said for photographs or sketches of medicine bundle contents.
Two Mohawk leaders sued a museum, trying to remove a False Face Society mask or "Ga:goh:sah" from an exhibit because "it was a medicine object intended to be seen only by community members and that its public display would cause irreparable harm to the Mohawk." The Grand Council of the Haudenosaunee has ruled that such masks are not for sale or public display, nor are Corn Husk Society masks.
Tribes and individuals within tribes do not always agree about what is or is not appropriate to display to the public. Many institutions do not exhibit Ghost Dance regalia. At the request of tribal leaders, the Brooklyn Museum is among those that does not exhibit Plains warrior's shields or "artifacts imbued with a warrior's power". Many tribes do not want grave goods or items associated with burials, such as funerary urns, in museums, and many would like associated grave goods reinterred. The process is often facilitated within the United States under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). In Canada, repatriation is negotiated between the tribes and museums or through Land Claims laws. In international situations, institutions are not always legally required to repatriate indigenous cultural items to their place of origin; some museums do so voluntarily, as with Yale University's decision to return 5,000 artifacts and human remains to Cusco, Peru.

Hospital Sketches

Hospital Sketches (1863) is a compilation of four sketches based on letters Louisa May Alcott sent home during the six weeks she spent as a volunteer nurse for the Union Army during the American Civil War in Georgetown.
Summary.
Tribulaton Periwinkle opens the story by complaining, "I want something to do." She dismisses suggestions to write a book, teach, get married, or start acting. When her younger brother suggests she "go nurse the soldiers", she immediately responds, "I will!" After substantial hardship in trying to obtain a spot, she has further difficulty finding a place on the train. She then describes her travel through New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore en route to Washington D. C.
Immediately after her arrival, Periwinkle must attend to the wounded from the Battle of Fredericksburg. Her first assignment is washing them before putting them to bed. She converses with the various wounded soldiers, including an Irishman and a Virginia blacksmith. The blacksmith's death in particular touches her deeply.
Composition and publication.
After the Civil War broke out, the town of Concord, Massachusetts rallied, inspiring many young men to volunteer. The company assembled on the town common on April 19, 1861, the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord as they set off. Louisa May Alcott wrote to her friend Alf Whitman that it was "a sight to behold". She was disappointed that she had to stay behind, lamenting, "as I can't fight, I will content myself with working with those who can." She joined local women who volunteered to sew clothes and provide other supplies. On her 30th birthday on November 29, 1862, she made up her mind to do more. She recorded in her journal, "Thirty years old. Decide to go to Washington as a nurse if I could find a place." She received her orders on December 11 and made her way to Georgetown, outside of Washington, D.C. While working as a nurse, Alcott contracted typhoid fever and was treated with mercury in the form of calomel. She survived but later recorded, "I was never ill before this time, and never well afterward."
While serving as a nurse, Alcott wrote several letters to her family in Concord. At the urging of others, she prepared them for publication, slightly altering and fictionalizing them. The narrator of the stories was renamed Tribulation Periwinkle but the sketches are virtually authentic to Alcott's real experiences.
The first of the sketches was published on May 22, 1863, in the abolitionist magazine "Boston Commonwealth" edited by family friend Franklin Benjamin Sanborn. The final sketch was published on June 26. Alcott herself did not care much for the writings, dismissing the idea that they were "witty", and admitted, "I wanted money." The pieces received great critical and popular acclaim making Alcott an overnight success.
Transcendentalist Moncure D. Conway, who helped secure the publication of the sketches in the "Commonwealth", recommended they be collected as a book. The author was approached by Thomas Niles, an up-and-coming employee of Roberts Brothers, to publish the sketches in book form. Instead, she turned to the more established publisher James Redpath, who paid her $40 for the book. At her father's suggestion, the book was dedicated to Hannah Stevenson, a friend who had helped Alcott secure her position as a volunteer nurse. The book, priced at 50 cents, earned the author five cents in royalties for every copy sold, with an additional five cents donated to children orphaned by the war. Years later, Walt Whitman contacted Redpath, hoping he would publish his own recollections as a Civil War nurse. As he wrote, the book "Memoranda During the War", would be "something considerably more than mere hospital sketches."
Fourteen years later after its publication, Alcott reflected on avoiding Roberts Brothers, who later published "Little Women" (1868): "Shortsighted Louisa! Little did you dream that this same Roberts Brothers were to help you make your fortune a few years later." After that novel's success, Niles offered to republish "Hospital Sketches" under the Roberts Brothers imprint, and Alcott slightly expanded it.
Reception.
Louisa May Alcott's father Amos Bronson Alcott predicted the sketches "likely to be popular, the subject and style of treatment alike commending it to the reader, and to the Army especially. I see nothing in the way of a good appreciation of Louisa's merits as a woman and a writer. Nothing could be more surprising to her or agreeable to us." Her father was right; when it proved popular, Alcott was surprised by her own success. As she wrote: "I cannot see why people like a few extracts from topsey turvey letters written on inverted tea kettles, waiting for gruel to warm, or poultices to cool, for boys to wake and be tormented." Henry James, Sr. wrote her a letter to applaud "her charming pictures of hospital service." The "Boston Evening Transcript" called the book "fluent and sparkling, with touches of quiet humor and lively wit". Alcott herself wrote, "I find I've done a good thing without knowing it."

Sutton Coldfield Town railway station

Sutton Coldfield Town railway station, also referred to as Sutton Town, was a railway station in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, England, on the Midland Railway's Sutton Park Line.
History.
The station was opened as "Sutton Coldfield" on 1 July 1879, and was renamed to "Sutton Coldfield Town" on 1 May 1882. On 1 April 1904 the name reverted to "Sutton Coldfield". It was renamed again to "Sutton Coldfield Town" on 2 June 1924, but closed to passengers on 1 January 1925.
The line remains open for freight trains.
The station platform office building remains on the platform opposite the office buildings. Inside the building is an old fireplace from the 60's, a 60's style floor and an old television, which is likely to have been dumped there. The building has no roof or windows and is potentially listed.

Leucines

The leucines are primarily the four isomeric amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, "tert"-leucine and norleucine. Being compared with the four butanols, they could be classified as butyl-substituted glycines; they represent all four possible variations.
Leucine and isoleucine belong to the proteinogenic amino acids; the others are non-natural.
Including the stereoisomers, six further isomers could be added: D-leucine, D-isoleucine, L-"allo"-isoleucine, D-"allo"-isoleucine, D-"tert"-leucine and D-norleucine.
Cycloleucine could be classified as a cyclic derivate of norleucine. With a cyclopentane-ring, it has two hydrogen atoms fewer and thus is not an isomer. The α-carbon atom is not a stereocenter.

The Gypsies (poem)

The Gypsies () is a narrative poem by Alexander Pushkin, originally written in Russian in 1824 and first published in 1827. The last of Pushkin's four 'Southern Poems' written during his exile in the south of the Russian Empire, "The Gypsies" is also considered to be the most mature of these Southern poems, and has been praised for originality and its engagement with psychological and moral issues. The poem has inspired at least eighteen operas and several ballets.
Outline of the poem.
The poem opens with an establishment of the setting in Bessarabia and a colorful, lively description of the activities of a gypsy camp there:
<poem>
Полузавешанных коврами,
Готовит ужин; в чистом поле
Ручной медведь лежит на воле. (ll.7–12)</poem>
The poem is written almost exclusively in iambic tetrameter, and this regular metre is established from the outset:
Once the scene is set, the characters are introduced: an old man is waiting for his daughter Zemfira to return home while his dinner grows cold. When she arrives, she announces that she has brought home a man with her, Aleko, who has fled the city because the law is pursuing him.
At this point the narrative style changes: the omniscent narrator steps asisde and the majority of the rest of the poem takes the form of a dialogue, following the tradition of closet drama. The Old Man and Zemfira welcome Aleko, but he retains lingering doubts about the possibility of happiness at the Gypsy camp:
<poem>
На опустелую равнину
Истолковать себе не смел. (ll.94–98)</poem>
Aleko is established as a Romantic hero: the narrator describes him as a tormented victim of passion and sounds an ominous note that his passions will return.
<poem>
Его послушною душой
В его измученной груди
Они проснутся: погоди! (l.140–145)</poem>
Zemfira asks Aleko if he misses the splendor of his homeland, but he responds that his only desire is to spend his life with her in voluntary exile. (ll.174–176). The Old Man warns that although Aleko loves the Gypsy life, this feeling may not last forever, and tells a story of a man that he knew who spent his entire life with the Gypsies but who eventually pined for his homeland and asked to be buried there. (ll.181–216). This is thought to be a reference to the Roman poet Ovid, who was banished to Tomis in 8 AD.
Two years pass (l.225) and Aleko remains with Zemfira in the Gypsy camp. However, Zemfira begins to sing a love song about an adulterous affair which shocks and scares Aleko (ll.259–266). At this point the poem switches from iambic tetrameter and is less consistent with fewer feet.
The Old Man warns Aleko that he has heard this song before from his wife Mariula who later left him. Aleko is upset by the song and falls asleep, and Zemfira is angry when she hears him pronounce another woman's name in his sleep (l.327). The Old Man warns Aleko not to expect Zemfira to be faithful (ll.287–299), and tells him in detail about how Mariula left him after only a year (ll.370–409). Aleko, however, insists on his "rights" (l.419), or at least the possibility of getting the pleasure of revenge (l.420).
Zemfira meets her lover at night and, just as they are parting, Aleko catches them together. In a scene of extremely fast-moving dialogue, he kills them both. The Old Man tells him to leave the Gypsies because his understanding of law, freedom and order are different from his (ll.510–520):
<poem>
Мы дики; нет у нас законов,
Не нужно крови нам и стонов –
Ты не рожден для дикой доли,
Ты для себя лишь хочешь воли. (ll.510–516)</poem>
The poem closes with an epilogue narrated in the first person, who warns that the gypsy encampments offer no freedom from the "fateful passions" and problems of life.
<poem>
И всюду страсти роковые,
И от судеб защиты нет. (ll.566–ll.569)</poem>
Analysis.
The poem addresses and interrogates the concept of the noble savage, an idea which had gained popular currency in the Romantic Age which held that those people who live further from "civilization" live "in harmony with nature and a more simple, childlike and blessed life" than the alienated and unhappy people in European cities. Aleko's failure to integrate with the gypsies and his continued insistence on the moral standards of the city in the gypsy encampment challenge the notion that happiness can be found by reverting to nature. The poem closes with a clear attack on the idea of the noble savage: "But even among you, poor sons of nature, there is no happiness! Tormenting dreams live below your bedraggled tents". [Но счастья нет и между вами, / Природы бедные сыны!... / И под издранными шатрами / Живут мучительные сны.] (ll.562–565)
"The Gypsies" is the last of Pushkin's "Southern Poems", and is usually considered to be the most mature and sophisticated of these works. The "Southern Poems" are indebted to Byron: they use exotic and orientalized settings, rapid transitions, and chart sexual and military conquest. However, critics agree that "The Gypsies", while inheriting much from the Byronic tradition, also strives to move away from it. Michael Wachtel argues that "the grim, fatalistic acceptance of life as a tragedy and of individual experience as endless repetition brings the work closer to Antiquity than to Byron". Antony Wood suggests that "The Gypsies" is a parody of both Rousseau's Noble Savage idea and Byron's verse tales, pointing out that "Aleko, pursuing the ideal of the Noble Savage, himself comes to present the spectacle of an noble citizen." John Bayley argues that "The Gypsies" "shows the problem of a poet as naturally classical as Pushkin in an epoch fashionably and self-consciously romantic."
Adaptations.
Boris Gasparov estimates that "The Gypsies" has inspired some eighteen operas and half a dozen ballets, including Sergei Rachmaninoff's "Aleko" (1893), Ruggero Leoncavallo's "Zingari" (1912), and Vasily Kalafati's "Gypsies" ["Tsygany"] (1941).
It is speculated that "The Gypsies" was the inspiration for Prosper Mérimée's novella "Carmen" written in 1845, on which Georges Bizet's opera "Carmen" was based in 1875. Mérimée had read the poem in Russian by 1840 and translated it into French in 1852.

1938 British Lions tour to South Africa

The 1938 British Isles tour to South Africa was the fourteenth tour by a British Isles team and the sixth to South Africa. The tour is retrospectively classed as one of the British Lions tours, as the Lions naming convention was not adopted until 1950.
The tour party was led by Ireland's Sam Walker and managed by Col. Hartley, and took in 24 matches. Of the 24 games, 19 were against club or invitational teams, three were test matches against the South African national team and the other two games were outside South Africa against Rhodesia. The British Isles lost two and won one of the test matches, and in the non-test games lost five and won sixteen.
Like many of the early Lions parties, the tour did not represent the best of British and Irish rugby talent. Obvious omissions included Wilf Wooller and Cliff Jones.

900 Series

A 900 series refers to three consecutive perfect games bowled by an individual bowler. A 300 is a perfect score in one game, thus a player's score would be 900 in a series of three consecutive games (the typical number of games in a single league session). To date, 22 individuals have bowled a total of 23 sanctioned 900 series.
Sanctioning issues.
On 1 July 1982, Glenn Allison bowled the first 900 series in sanctioned league play, although it was not officially sanctioned by the American Bowling Congress due to "non-compliant" lane conditions. To this day, there is a "cult following" supporting Glenn Allison and urging the USBC to officially recognize him as the first bowler to achieve a perfect series, especially because it was accomplished before the era of reactive bowling balls, and other scores in the bowling center that night were not unusually high.
The only bowler to be credited with multiple 900 series is Robert Mushtare, who claims to have bowled five individual 900 series within the span of one year. He claims that he bowled two perfect series in practice, and an additional three in league play. The USBC denied one of his in-league 900 series, but the other two were officially sanctioned. His claims were the subject of an ESPN feature on "Outside the Lines". His feat, while spectacular if true, is considered by many critics to be fraudulent, especially given that both sanctioned series were shot in a pre-bowl session (sanctioned league play outside of the normally scheduled day/time) rather than during his normal league session, so few people were around to witness either one.
The first 900 in the history of the Professional Bowlers Association was bowled by Joe Scarborough on 22 April 2013 in a PBA50 Tour (formerly PBA Senior Tour) event. The PBA had seen 3 consecutive 300 games on one other occasion, by Norm Duke in 1996, but this was not considered to be an official 900 series because the first two of Duke's 300 games were at the end of one round of play and the third was at the beginning of the next round.

<doc id="20127608" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20127608" title="Cithara">
Cithara

The cithara or kithara (, ) was an ancient Greek musical instrument in the lyre or lyra family. In modern Greek the word "kithara" has come to mean "guitar" (a word whose origins are found in "kithara").
The kithara was a professional version of the two-stringed lyre. As opposed to the simpler lyre, which was a folk-instrument, the kithara was primarily used by professional musicians, called kitharodes. The kithara's origins are likely Asiatic. The barbiton was a bass version of the kithara popular in the eastern Aegean and ancient Asia Minor.
Construction.
The kithara had a deep, wooden sounding box composed of two resonating tables, either flat or slightly arched, connected by ribs or sides of equal width. At the top, its strings were knotted around the crossbar or yoke ("zugon") or to rings threaded over the bar, or wound around pegs. The other end of the strings was secured to a tail-piece after passing over a flat bridge, or the tail-piece and bridge were combined. Most vase paintings show kitharas with seven strings, in agreement with ancient authors, but these also mention that occasionally a skillful kitharode would use more than the conventional seven strings.
It was played with a rigid plectrum (or more modernly called pick) held in the right hand, with elbow outstretched and palm bent inwards, while the strings with undesired notes were damped with the straightened fingers of the left hand.
Uses.
The kithara was played primarily to accompany dances and epic recitations, rhapsodies, odes, and lyric songs. It was also played solo at the receptions, banquets, national games, and trials of skill. The music from this instrument was said to be the lyre for drinking parties and is considered an invention of Terpander. Aristotle said that these string instruments were not for educational purposes but for pleasure only.
The kithara was the virtuoso's instrument, generally known as taking a great deal of skill.
Sappho is closely associated with music, especially string instruments like the kithara and the barbitos. She was a woman of high social standing and composed songs that focused on the emotions. A Greek mythology story goes that she ascended the steep slopes of Mount Parnassus where she was welcomed by the Muses. She wandered through the laurel grove and came upon the cave of Apollo, where she bathed in the Castalian Spring and took Phoebus' plectrum to play skillful music. The sacred nymphs danced while she stroked the strings with much talent to bring forth sweet musical melodies from the resonant kithara.

Midland Railway 1322 Class

The Midland Railway (MR) 1322 Class was a class of small 0-4-0ST steam locomotives designed for shunting.
Ten engines were built at Derby Works, five in 1883 and the remainder in 1889–1890. Their original numbers were 1322–1326, 202, 1428–1430, 1697. In 1892 they were all placed on the duplicate list as 1322A–1326A, 202A, 1428A–1430A, 1697A. Nos 202A and 1429A were withdrawn before the Midland's 1907 renumbering scheme, leaving the remainder to become 1500–1507. By 1928, all but 1506 had been withdrawn, and in 1930 the survivor 1506 was renumbered 1509 to make room for the ex-S&DJR Fox, Walker 0-6-0ST locomotives taken into LMS stock that year. This engine survived, albeit in departmental stock as a works shunter at Derby Works, until 1949. It was allocated the British Railways number 41509. It was not preserved.
The next class of shunting engines built by the Midland was the 1116A Class, which was nearly identical.

Adolf Strodtmann

Adolf Heinrich Strodtmann (24 March 1829 Flensburg - 17 March 1879 Steglitz) was a German poet, journalist, translator and literary historian. He wrote an early biography of Heinrich Heine and emigrated to the United States for a time.
Biography.
He had a peripatetic youth, learning the classics in four gymnasiums. Although this was not conducive to learning the classics, it had the benefit of showing him things from several points of view and taught him the Danish language well. In 1848 he participated, on the side of the Germans, in the First Schleswig War. He was severely wounded and spent some time in Copenhagen harbor on the prison ship “Dronning Maria.” On being set at liberty, he published "Lieder eines Gefangenen auf der Dronning Maria" (Songs of a prisoner of the “Dronning Maria”, 1848). Strodtmann then became a student at the University of Bonn where he especially became devoted to Gottfried Kinkel; however, after a short time, he was suspended because of his political activities. He then published "Lieder der Nacht" (Songs of the Night, 1850) and a biography of Gottfried Kinkel (1850).
He went to Paris, to London, and in 1852, he sailed for America, and with help from his father, the not-very-practical ex-student entered the book trade in Philadelphia, buying, selling and lending, as well as publishing a literary magazine called "Die Locomotive". The business was not successful and closed in 1854, after which he traveled around the country pursuing literary interests, eventually settling in New York City. Weary of his various efforts to make a living, he returned to Germany in 1856, becoming a citizen of Hamburg. He covered the Franco-Prussian War for several newspapers, and in 1871, he moved to a suburb of Berlin where he lived for the rest of his life.
The beginning of his writing career was mostly devoted to composing poetry, but as he became older and less revolutionary, he devoted more time to translation (into German) and literary history. He is most noticed as an early biographer of Heinrich Heine and a compiler of his work. He published the correspondence of the poet Bürger. He translated three works from French, but mostly concentrated on Danish and English which he knew better. A noteworthy example of his translations from English is his "Amerikanische Anthologie" of 1870.

USS Windham County (LST-1170)

USS "Windham County" (LST-1170), previously USS "LST-1170", was a United States Navy landing ship tank (LST) in commission from 1954 to 1973 which saw service in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific and served in the Vietnam War.
Construction and commissioning.
USS "LST-1170" was laid down on 21 April 1953 by the Christy Corporation, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. She was launched on 22 May 1954, sponsored by Mrs. Joseph McCarthy, and commissioned on 15 December 1954 with Lieutenant Commander Max Wells in command.
Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean service.
"LST-1170" joined the United States Atlantic Fleet at her home port, Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek at Virginia Beach, Virginia, in January 1955. Following shakedown and type training, she was renamed USS "Windham County" (LST-1170) on 1 July 1955 and spent much of July and August 1955 in more training exercises. She then helped to support Operation Caesar, an underwater surveillance project, which lasted through the end of 1955.
On 21 February 1956, "Windham County" reported to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, for overhaul and conversion.
From January 1957 to mid-March 1957, "Windham County" operated off the Virginia Capes area. On 14 March 1957, after a brief stop at Davisville, Rhode Island, "Windham County" proceeded to the Caribbean for operations off Barbados. Upon returning to Little Creek on 1 April 1957, she operated from there until 2 May 1957, when she was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea for a tour of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet. During the cruise, she made stops at Tangier, Morocco; Spain; Malta; Italy; and Gibraltar. She returned to Davisville on 1 October 1957, then headed for Little Creek, arriving there on 18 October 1957.
"Windham County" got underway for the Caribbean on 14 November 1957 for exercises. After returning to Little Creek on 26 November 1957, she ended 1957 undergoing routine upkeep.

Gertrudiskerk

The Gertrudiskerk is a church approachable from the large market in the center of Bergen op Zoom. The towers of the church are called "pepper plant towers". An old legend says St. Gertrude, abbess of the abbey in Nivelles, founded the church in 654. 
The older part of the church consisting of the towers, dates to around 1370. These were later incorporated in probably the fourteenth and fifteenth century when changes were made to the church. The building at that time was used for Catholic worship services. The current church building, completed in 1477 was designed by Evert Spoorwater. He devised a new chancel with chancel ambulatory and vaults in the ship style of the Brabatine Gothic.
History.
In 1489 Anthonis submitted to Keldermans a design for a new church in the Late Gothic style. In spite of a constant lack of money, a new chancel and transept were realized. During the troubles of 1580 the church was plundered and thereafter used as a military warehouse. A cannonade by the French in 1747 left the church devastated. In 1750 rebuilding efforts started again, albeit with a more sober character. The church was 9 meters lower after being rebuilt. 
In 1586 the church was arranged for reformed services. The new chancel and transept were completed and in 1698 were demolished. Thus only a small part remained of the second transept. Material was needed at this time for the construction of fortifications.
From 1586 to 1966 the reformed congregation had this building in possession. In 1747 the building burned down after the bombardment by the French. Rebuilding took place using Protestant funds and Protestant stones. The reformed congregation retained control through the 1950s and 1960s and people began to regret that more and more. It appeared an impossible task to maintain such a large building. In 1966 the church was transferred to the municipality so the government could restore the building.
New misfortune struck the church again in 1972 when a fire broke out. The whole interior including the 18th century pipe organ of Del Haye was lost. In the 1980s restoration started anew. The arrangement that followed would be that the municipality would keep the building and property in good maintenance, and the two Catholic parishes in the city center would merge to become the Sint Gertrudiskerk. The congregation would pay for heating the church and the municipality would receive a limited use charge.
The large advantage of this agreement was that the empty restored church in time could be equipped with religious furnishings. Estimated cost for the restoration was € 1,000,000. In 1987, the church was again inaugurated by the bishop of Breda Mgr. H. Ernst.
Interior.
Among the interior features are a stained glass window honoring Saint Gertrudis, two pulpits, three Flemish confessionals and an Ibach pipe organ from 1863. Also some sepulchral monuments and several ecclessiastical objects are on display.
Present.
The church was returned in the second half of the 20th century to the Catholic community and is now a parish church. The church is also used for ecumenical ceremonies and special religious celebrations. Larger and smaller concerts are both being held here, thanks to the excellent acoustics. The seating is turned away from the altar during performances towards a special concert podium and the Ibach organ.

Barton Knob

Barton Knob is a mountain summit located on Cheat Mountain in southeastern Randolph County, West Virginia. Easily accessible during warm-weather months, Bickle Knob is also home to one of the few remaining fire towers in Monongahela National Forest.
Fire Tower.
One of the most notable features is its fire tower, which has graced the top of the mountain since at least 1939. While the tower is still in place today, it has been abandoned and is no longer safe to climb. As of June 2010, the Forest Service plans to remove the tower as part of a project to construct a radio repeater on Barton Knob.
Strip mining.
The area surrounding Barton Knob is also notable for having been strip mined prior to its acquisition by Monongahela National Forest as part of the Mower Tract in 1986. Today, MNF's Strip Mine Trail (Trail #350) traverses much of the area mined on the south side of Barton Knob and a ledge created continuing east along Cheat Mountain.
Rainbow Gathering.
In 2005, the Rainbow Gathering considered using (and some may have used) strip-mined land near Barton Knob after being displaced from the original meeting site near Alpena.
Forest restoration.
In late 2010, the Forest Service designated a section of Barton Knob as the Barton Bench Ecological Restoration Site. After strip mining, the land had been replanted with non-native grasses to protect the soil. This also led to an arresting of ecological development as the grasses kept out any native growths. The Forest Service is conducting experiments on various ways to restart ecological succession on the site with an eye towards eventual reforestation with native red spruce and hardwood trees.

Spooner Act

The First Spooner Act of 1902 (aka Panama Canal Act, 32 Stat. 481 ) was written by Wisconsin senator John Coit Spooner, enacted on June 28, 1902, and signed by Roosevelt the following day. It authorized purchasing the assets of a French syndicate called the "Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama", provided that a treaty could be negotiated with the Republic of Colombia. 
The syndicate, headed by Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, sold at a price reduced from $110 million to only $40 million. US lawyer William Nelson Cromwell subsequently got a $800,000 commission for his lobbying. 
The Spooner Act is followed by the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of Nov. 18, 1903.

List of Tugs characters

"Tugs", a British children's television series created by the producers of "Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends", Robert D. Cardona and David Mitton, features two groups of anthropomorphized tugboat fleets: the Star Fleet and the Z-Stacks. They compete against each other in the fictional town of Bigg City Port.
In the North American adaptation, "Salty's Lighthouse", the stories were re-purposed for a younger audience. The two groups were no longer rival tug fleets, and the characters underwent various changes. Sunshine, Captain Star, and Little Ditcher were considered female. Sunshine became the sister of fellow switcher Ten Cents. British accents were changed to American accents. Some names were changed, for instance, Big Mac became Big Stack, O.J. became Otis, and Zebedee became Zeebee.
Star Fleet.
The Star Fleet is a group who aims to work together on getting and fulfilling port contracts. It is led by Captain Star. Its symbol is a red funnel with blue and white stripes around the top. Fleet members also carry a red flag with a white star. Reporting to Captain Star are seven tugs, each of which has a numbered smoke stack. In "Regatta", Grampus the submarine becomes a member of Star Fleet. The Star Fleet tugs are modeled after the San Francisco tugs of the 1920s.
Ten Cents.
Ten Cents (#1) works as a harbour switcher on a wide variety of tasks around Bigg City Port. He typically tows barges, and has teamed up with the entire fleet on docking operations for ocean liners. As one of the younger tugs, he is strong-willed and it takes a lot to break him. He is quick-witted and takes action swiftly without hesitation. He never lets other tugs bully him, but is willing to stand up for the others, even if he puts himself at risk.
Ten Cents is almost always seen with Sunshine, the Star Fleet's second switcher. Hercules often relies on Ten Cents to look after others such as Lillie or Duchess. In "Salty's Lighthouse", Ten Cents and Sunshine are brother and sister.
Although the design of Ten Cents resembles a San Francisco 1920s tug, Ten Cents speaks with a strong East End cockney accent. He wears a blue flat cap; his whistle is strident but middle pitched, and he sounds it with quick double or triple bursts. He is the featured tug in the "Tugs" logo. Chris Tulloch notes that Ten Cents was the first model he built for the series: "Ten Cents was 20 long, and his hull (fibreglass) was the basis for Zip and Zug."
Ten Cents is voiced by Simon Nash. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he is voiced by Ian James Corlett.
Big Mac.
Big Mac (#2) is a harbour tug with a broad Glaswegian accent. He usually tugs heavy loads and is one of the strongest in the fleet. He works mainly with his brother, Warrior, another very strong tug who shares a similar large face and blue flat cap. They are not as close as Ten Cents and Sunshine- Warrior sometimes doesn't understand Big Mac's ideas, and Warrior's clumsiness sometimes infuriates Big Mac- but they have a mutual respect for each other. Big Mac's design is based on the San Francisco tugs of the 1920s.
Big Mac sometimes comes across as rude, macho, and abrasive, but he has a heart of gold, as he is willing to help those in trouble, and uses his great strength for this wherever he can. He tries to remain level-headed when working out a plan.
Big Mac is voiced by Nigel Anthony. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he is named Big Stack, and is voiced by Paul Dobson.
O.J..
O.J. (#3) is the sole remaining paddle-driven harbour tug in Bigg City Port. As the Star Fleet's "wise elder", he possesses extensive knowledge and experience of harbour life and maneuvers. He supervises some of the more complicated operations such as coordinating the docking of an ocean liner. Occasionally, he swiftly devises strategies to help the Star Fleet out of predicaments. Although he can perform a variety of tasks, he is sometimes restricted by his age and mechanical condition. In "Quarantine", Captain Star says that "he had given many years of good service, but time was catching up on him." He does not tolerate nonsense, and is quick to correct the younger tugs on mistakes, but shows care like a grandfather to his grandchildren.
Ironically, Chris Tulloch noted that the O.J. model used in the series was one of the most reliable. Other models, which had internal machinery, would often threaten to "turn turtle" and would have to be fixed firmly to a chassis. However, O.J. had paddle wheels that helped his stability. Regardless, Tulloch applied the fixture in order to keep him from bobbing up and down too much like a toy boat.
O.J.'s elderly condition has been a recurring gag in the series, as a target of jokes and insults from both the Star Fleet and Z-Stacks tugs. In one episode that involved a heat wave, O.J. accidentally causes the sinking of the Fulton Ferry. The scrap dealers Burke and Blair try to persuade Captain Star to sell O.J., but Ten Cents is able to convince Captain Star to overhaul him instead.
He has a Welsh accent and is voiced by Timothy Bateson. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he is named Otis and is voiced by Ian James Corlett.
O.J. has some appearances in the related "Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends" series, where he is rebuilt as a prop for its harbour scenes.
We are never told what O.J. stands for in the series, but his full name is believed to have been "Old Jones".
Top Hat.
Top Hat (#4) is an uppity, snobbish railway tug noted by his large black hat and monocle. He speaks in an upper class Posh English accent, and believes he is the best tug in the Star Fleet. His arrogance often annoys other members of the fleet, and Captain Star occasionally berates him. His tasks include distributing railway rolling stock with his barges Frank and Eddie.
His design resembles the San Francisco tugs from the 1920s and the John A. Dialogue & Sons-built New York Central Tugboat 13. As a railway tug, he has an elevated wheelhouse which allows pilots and crews to see over the top of their high loads. However, he differs from the real world railway tugs in that he can bob his wheelhouse up and down, which allows him to move more dramatically or comically.
Top Hat loathes any activities that can make his paint dirty, and goes to lengths to avoid it. In "High Tide", Big Mac remarks that he always wriggles out of nasty jobs – ironically, he is given the task of hauling Lord Stinker, a garbage barge, to the city dump. He is seen with Lord Stinker twice in the series.
Despite his uppity demeanour and dislike of nasty jobs, Top Hat has some nowse, and can cope in a crisis.
He is voiced by John Baddeley. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he is voiced by Long John Baldry.
Warrior.
Warrior (#5) has a large face and blue flat cap; he is the younger brother of Big Mac. He performs a variety of tasks around Bigg City Port, and often partners with Big Mac on operations such as towing barges. He tries not to mess up, even though he is sometimes clumsy. His design resembles the San Francisco tugs in the 1920s. When he is surprised he says "Sufferin' Stacks!". He is not the brightest tug in the fleet, but he is strong, and always ready to help, which means that in spite of his clumsiness, the rest of the fleet, and other characters, respect him. His clumsiness also makes him the butt of many of the Z-Stacks' jokes.
He is voiced by Sean Barrett. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he is voiced by Michael Donovan.
Hercules.
Hercules (#6) is an ocean-going tug who is tasked with escorting large vessels to port, or answering distress calls at sea. He is in charge of large operations and important contracts. He makes occasional appearances in the series.
His hull and superstructure resemble "Hercules", a 1907 ocean-going tug built in New Jersey and operating in San Francisco. Chris Tulloch notes that the Hercules model was about 36 inches long. His face has sideburns.
Hercules is a cool-headed fighter who speaks in a clear, soft English accent. He is not bothered by the antics of the Z-Stacks or Bluenose- he simply brushes off their jibes and orders. He is highly regarded by the harbour tugs; even Zorran knows that he cannot win a confrontation with him. But there is a softer side to his character- he has a sense of humour, as demonstrated in the episode "Ghosts", and refers to his comrades as "ma' dears", "darling", and "sweetheart". He is in love with Lillie Lightship.
He is voiced by Nigel Anthony. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he is voiced by Long John Baldry.
Sunshine.
Sunshine (#7) is a small harbour switcher who performs various tasks around Bigg City Port. He is occasionally cheeky, but strong-willed. He is quick-witted and takes action swiftly without hesitation. He can figure out things quickly, for instance, in "Jinxed", he connects Boomers mishaps to Ten Centss sounding of his steam hooter. He has a rather soft Newcastle (Geordie) accent, and often whistles when he speaks, because he is missing some of his front teeth. His whistle is middle-to-high pitched, and he has a whooping sound that is upbeat and consistent with his name. He lived up river for a long time, and knows his way around it very well, as demonstrated in the final episode "Bigg Freeze".
Sunshine is voiced by Shaun Prendergast. In "Salty's Lighthouse", Sunshine is the sister of Ten Cents, and is voiced by Andrea Libman.
Sunshine has a small cameo in Robert Cardona's other tugboat series, "Theodore Tugboat". When the Harbour Master receives cookies from his mother, the cookies look like him.
Grampus.
Grampus is a small submarine, that formerly worked for the Navy. He is a friend of the Star Fleet tugs, and has helped them out in various situations. In "Pirate", he helps prove the innocence of Ten Cents, who was accused of stealing barges. In "Regatta", he is nearly blown up by Bluenose, an obnoxious naval tug, after having been branded as 'too old' for further service. However, he is rescued on 4 July, when Captain Star buys him and makes him the first submarine in the Star Fleet. Grampus thus likes to blow water in the tug's faces, notably Bluenose.
According to model maker Jeremy King, Grampus was modeled after Grampus-class submarines. Spike Knight fashioned Grampus in fiberglass by looking at old Grampus photos. He used a "parallel lifting version of the tugs' pull along trolleys so he could surface."
Grampus speaks with a Central English accent, with a noticeable lisp. He is voiced by Lee Cornes. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he is voiced by Brad Swaile.
Frank & Eddie.
Frank and Eddie are a pair of twin railway barges (also known as Car floats) who work mostly with Top Hat the railway tug. They are used for the transportation of railway stock across the port. They are very quick-witted and are among the few that can deal with Top Hat's superiority. Both of the twins speak with Cockney accents. Their characters are portrayed by Nigel Anthony (Frank) and Timothy Bateson (Eddie). In Salty's Lighthouse they were both voiced by Ian James Corlett.
Captain Star.
Captain Star is the owner of Star Fleet. He narrates the series in the past tense, implying that he is no longer at the helm of the fleet, and that he is retired. He does not appear on screen, as he prefers to communicate out of a megaphone from the window of the Star Fleet dock building. He takes great pride in his fleet, and is strict in order to make them successful.
Captain Star is voiced by Patrick Allen. In "Salty's Lighthouse", Captain Star is a female character and is voiced by Lenore Zann.
Z-Stacks.
The Z-Stacks are devious, tricky and scheming boats. Their leader is Captain Zero, although the first tug Zorran runs the day-to-day operations. They regularly find ways to hinder and infuriate their rival Star Fleet tugs. Their physical appearance is modeled after the 1920s Moran tugs that were active in New York City.
Zorran.
Zorran is Captain Zeros first tug, and the fleet leader of the Z-Stacks. He is a harbour tug who hatches various devious schemes against the Star Fleet. He seems to regard the other members of his fleet with as much disdain as he regards the rival Star Tugs. However, his plans usually backfire in execution, either because of incompetence of the other Z-Stacks, or because of his own overconfidence. He is not afraid of anyone, including his boss, except for Hercules.
Zorran speaks with a mild Cockney accent. Although he is a steam-driven tug, his deep, aggressive whistle sounds more like the air-horns fitted to modern diesel locomotives, trucks and ships.
When he is not scheming, he is a sensible leader of the fleet. In "Munitions", he oversees a large delivery of explosives by directing the other fleet members to follow correct safety precautions. At the Naval Pool, he takes O.J.s side when arguing with Bluenose over balancing common sense with orders. When a fire breaks out, he urges rival tug Ten Cents to get out of the danger zone, although he later delights opportunely when the tramp steamer Krakatoa explodes.
Jeremy King built the model for Zorran. In an interview with James Gratton, he mentions that the tugs "had a fibreglass hull taken from a wooden pattern into which was fitted a perspex deck and superstructure. The moving eyes were painted onto a half-cylinder that rose, fell and turned with two servos behind the face masks."
Zorran is voiced by the series art director, Chris Tulloch, although his credit is not listed. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he has been voiced by Scott McNeil and Kirby Morrow.
Zebedee.
Zebedee is Captain Zeros second tug; he performs a variety of tasks around Bigg City Port. He speaks with a Scouse (Liverpool) accent. He can be mean and vindictive on the outside, however, he is the only Z-Stack who is shown to have a good streak. In "High Winds", he has a guilty conscience and ends up helping Star Fleet tow Princess Alice.
He is voiced by Nigel Anthony. In "Salty's Lighthouse", his name is pronounced "Zee-Bee". He is voiced by Ian James Corlett.
Zebedee's model is shown in the "Thomas and Friends" episode "Something in the Air", along with Zip, as two of the tugs who helped Henry the Green Engine after a water accident.
Zak.
Zak is the third member of the Z-Stacks. He is usually paired with Zebedee. He is aggressive and threatening, and acts like a thug. He views himself as a potential leader of the Z-Stacks.
His design is based on the Baltimore and Luna tugs.
The only episode in which Zak had a major role was "High Tide", where he and Zebedee compete against Big Mac and Warrior for a big steel contract. After ignoring a call for maintenance on his engine, Zak tries to take a shortcut through a Bigg City canal, but it backfires when Zebedee's tall load strikes and collapses a railway bridge.
He is voiced by Shaun Prendergast, who characterizes him with a gruff Cockney accent. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he has a Brooklyn accent and is voiced by Terry Klassen.
Zug.
As the fourth tug in the Z-Stacks, Zug is a harbour switcher that tows barges and works on liner docking operations. He is a vindictive tug who works mainly with Zip; they hatch various schemes against their rivals Ten Cents and Sunshine. Zug is the brains of the operation, at least in comparison to Zip. Zug is also occasionally seen trailing Zorran. He played a major role in the episode "Trapped", where he accidentally jammed a tramper across the river, trapping the Star Tugs.
He is voiced by Mike Mulloy with an Eastern European accent. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he is voiced by Scott McNeil, and later, Kirby Morrow.
Zip.
Zip is the second harbour switcher in the Z-Stacks fleet. He works alongside Zug on minor contracts such as the freighting of quarried boulders. He speaks with a neutral English accent. He is described as being naive and "slow in the head", and takes some time to understand terms such as "devious". He avoids confrontations and is easily dominated by his partner Zug. Perhaps because of this, he never has a major role in any episode, and is never seen by himself.
He is voiced by John Baddeley with a neutral English accent. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he is voiced by Ian James Corlett.
Captain Zero.
Captain Zero is the owner of the Z-Stacks. Like Captain Star, he participates remotely by using a megaphone from the window of the Zero dock building. He speaks with an Orcadian dialect. It is hinted in "High Winds" that he may have a criminal gangster background. He is always looking for ways to get ahead of Capain Star and often resorts to devious methods. His tugs fear him greatly and follow orders obediently. Zero only has dialogue in two episodes, though his megaphone is seen in the episode "Jinxed".
He is voiced by Mike Mulloy. In "Salty's Lighthouse", he is voiced by French Tickner.
Supporting.
Izzy Gomez.
Izzy is a large tramp steamer who regularly visits Bigg City Port with items such as bananas from Puerto Grande. He wears a large sombrero, has a thin moustache, and speaks with a Mexican accent. He is tight with money, but not a villain like the Z-Stacks.
Although trampers are required to be towed into port, Izzy does not like having to pay for one, and makes futile attempts to persuade both Star Tugs and Z-Stacks to tow him in for free, or for a cheap price. In "Ghosts", he gets a free tow from Zorran, as the latter is afraid of some recent haunting events. In "Warrior", he attempts to come in without a tow, but runs aground. He shows some kindness in the first episode by testifying on Sunshine's behalf when the latter was accused of causing an accident while docking a liner.
He is voiced by Mike Mulloy. In "Salty's Lighthouse", his voice is provided by French Tickner but has an American accent.
Izzy's model makes some appearances in "Thomas & Friends" but without the large hat and moustache face.
Lillie Lightship.
Lillie is a lightship that is situated at Demder Rocks to warn shipping of potential hazard. She has a contract with the Star Fleet where they provide her with the necessary fuel and supplies to keep her light shining. She is good friends with the Star Fleets, and tries to be nice to the Z-Stacks, although the latter tugs rarely reciprocate. In "Bigg Freeze", she uses her light to guide Vienna, a beautiful ocean liner. She is in love with Hercules.
She is voiced by Sue Glover. In "Salty's Lighthouse", she is voiced by Venus Terzo.
Bluenose.
Bluenose is an official Navy tug that is assigned the regular Naval contracts alongside the Stars and Z-Stacks. He was once associated with Grampus, before the latter was to be used as target practice. In the episode Munitions, he is shown to be a bossy character, ordering the various other tugs about despite having their own individual orders. His disrespect and lack of common sense ends badly when his barge collides with another, which is loaded with munitions and starts a fire that almost consumes the whole city. Apart from being in a state of shock following the incident little is known about his character after the episode.
Fire Tug.
Known only as Fire Tug, this tug is responsible for responding to emergency situations. Regarded with highest respect by Sunshine and Ten Cents, he is often cool headed and can organise a situation quickly.

Cement industry in the People's Republic of China

The cement industry in China is the largest in the world, producing 2.18 Bt in 2012. 
Capacity.
China cement output reached more than 500 million tons in the first half of 2008; the figure will break 1.4 billion tons for the whole year considering the strong demand from post-earthquake reconstruction.
Concentration.
To improve the concentration of clusters is the primary objective for the structure adjustment of China cement industry considering the current concentration degree is only 20%. China cement industry is projected to accelerate its structure adjustment for fiscal year 2009. In addition, the major players will enhance the waste heat generation projects, as well as new production line construction. Moreover, the cement industry has a lack of capital as a whole; IPO and refinancing have been proposed as the main ways to solve the capital bottleneck.
China cement still faces many challenges, e.g. unreasonable structures, too many small companies, and backward production capacity. In 2006, China's central government issued a series of policies to accelerate the adjustment in the cement industry and eliminate backward production capacity. The National Development and Reform Commission confirmed that manufactures with backward output capacity should be entirely eliminated during 2007 to 2010, but the following 12 manufacturers will be strong supported.
With the recovery of China cement industry, along with the challenges in China cement industry, foreign investors have started to pay attention to China cement market, more and more are involved in the activities of merger and acquisitions.

Danum Academy

Danum Academy (formerly Danum School Technology College) is an academy school for the east of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. Danum is the Roman name for Doncaster.
Admissions.
It is for ages 11–18. The academy is split into two sites; the Lower School which caters for the Key Stage 3 students in Years 7, 8 and 9. The Upper School, on Armthorpe Road which educates the Years 10, 11 and also the Sixth Form. The main school site is next to the A18.
History.
Grammar schools.
Doncaster Technical High School for Girls became Doncaster Technical Grammar School for Girls in the early 1960s, later becoming Danum Grammar School for Girls on "Danum Road". Doncaster Technical High School for Boys on "Greyfriars Road" moved to "Armthorpe Road" in the 1950s, and had a similar name change to the girls' school. Edward Semper, the headmaster of the boys' schools, was one of the UK's leading proponents of specialist technical schools.
The Danum Grammar School for Boys (c.500 boys) and Danum Grammar School for Girls merged in 1970 to form the co-educational selective Danum Grammar School. It had a technical bias, similar to a technical school. At the same time Doncaster Grammar School had merged with its analogous female school. The school was administered by the County Borough of Doncaster Education Committee and had around 800 boys and girls.
Comprehensive.
In 1978 Danum Grammar School became the comprehensive Danum School, merging with Intake High School, located on Leger Way. Doncaster Grammar School became a comprehensive five years later in 1983.
Danum School gained Technology College status in 2002, and changed its name to reflect its new specialism.
Academy.
On 1 September 2011 Danum School Technology College formally gained academy status, and changed its name to Danum Academy.
Sixth form.
Danum Sixth Form is located in the Upper School of Danum and has approximately 450 students. The sixth form only accepts students with certain academic requirements; these are 6 GCSEs at grade C or above, including Maths and English.
In 2005, Danum Sixth Form achieved the highest point score per A Level than any other sixth form in Doncaster. Also, over 80% of leavers in 2005 continued their studies to pursue degree courses; these included Oxford and Cambridge.
Sport.
The school won the English School's basketball championship in 2006, beating Shenfield School 76-65 in the National Final, which was played in the Hemel Hempstead sports centre.

<doc id="20128105" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20128105" title="Wohl Rose Park">
Wohl Rose Park

The park was established in 1981. Over 400 varieties of roses are grown there, many of them gifts from countries around the world. The Wohl Rose Park covers . It is one of the few rose parks of its kind in the Middle East, where there is no rainfall in summer.
The park's Garden of Nations is made up of sections donated by other countries. Each section has rose varieties characteristic of, or grown in, the respective country. The park also has an experimental section where new varieties of roses are tested for their suitability for public and private gardens in Israel.
In October 2003, the Wohl Rose Park won an award for excellence in an international competition for rose gardens from all over the world. The park was proclaimed one of the eleven most beautiful rose gardens in the world. In addition to some 15,000 rose bushes, the park features expansive lawns, hills, quarries, an ornamental pond with aquatic plants and fish, a waterfall, rockeries, and sculptures. A sixth-century mosaic floor unearthed at Kibbutz Sde Nahum was installed in the park.
The Knesset Menorah is located outside the park, facing the Knesset.
Due to the park's location opposite the Prime Minister's Office and other government buildings, it is a choice site for Israeli demonstrators: The garden often hosts tent cities of protesters, with tables for petition signing, banners and placards.
History.
The original design for the park was drawn up in 1949. In its early years, the park was only used for official government ceremonies. It opened to the general public towards the end of the 1950s. It was known at the time as President's Park. In 1978-1979, David Gilad of the Israel Flower Board was looking for a location for a rose park that would be the focal point of the international rose congress that was to convene in Israel in October 1981. President's Park was deemed an appropriate site due to its unique location and panoramic views. The park was re-landscaped by landscape architect Joseph Segal. The project was carried out in cooperation with the Jerusalem Foundation under the sponsorship of Vivienne and Maurice Wohl.
Planting goals.
When selecting the rose varieties, one of the goals was to show different groups of roses: Species roses - the original species from which varieties were bred 300 years ago; Old Garden Roses - the products of early breeding of roses; and modern roses such as Hybrid tea roses, Floribunda, Polyanthas, miniature roses, rose shrubs, and modern climbers.
Another goal was to demonstrate various garden possibilities: Blossoming swathes of color, roses climbing up pergolas and pillars, "sculpted" rose shrubs, rambling roses, standards roses, roses with decorative fruit, hedges made up of rose bushes, and more.

<doc id="20128168" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20128168" title="India–Japan relations">
India–Japan relations

Throughout history, India–Japan relations have traditionally been strong. For centuries, India and Japan have engaged in cultural exchanges, primarily as a result of Buddhism which spread indirectly from India to Japan, via China and Korea. During the Second World War, Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army and the Japanese Imperial Army fought together in battles against the British forces. India is the largest recipient of Japanese official development assistance (ODA).
Political relations between the two nations have remained warm since India's independence. Japanese companies, such as Sony, Toyota, and Honda, have manufacturing facilities in India, and with the growth of the Indian economy, India is a big market for Japanese firms. Japanese firms in fact, some of the first firms to invest in India. The most prominent Japanese company to have an investment in India is automobiles multinational Suzuki, which is in partnership with Indian automobiles company Maruti Suzuki, the largest car manufacturer in the Indian market, and a subsidiary of the Japanese company.
In December 2006, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Japan culminated in the signing of the "Joint Statement Towards Japan-India Strategic and Global Partnership". Japan has helped finance many infrastructure projects in India, most notably the Delhi Metro system. Indian applicants were welcomed in 2006 to the JET Programme, starting with just one slot available in 2006 and 41 in 2007. Also, in the year 2007, the Japanese Self-Defence Forces and the Indian Navy took part in a joint naval exercise in the Indian Ocean, known as Malabar 2007, which also involved the naval forces of Australia, Singapore and the United States. The year 2007 was declared "India-Japan Friendship Year."
According to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 42% of Japanese people view India positively, with 4% expressing a negative view.
Historical relations.
Cultural exchanges between India and Japan began early in the 6th century with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan from India. The Indian monk Bodhisena arrived in Japan in 736 to spread Buddhism and performed eye-opening of the Great Buddha built in Tōdai-ji, and would remain in Japan until his death in 760. Buddhism and the intrinsically linked Indian culture had a great impact on Japanese culture, still felt today, and resulted in a natural sense of amicability between the two nations.
As a result of the link of Buddhism between India and Japan, monks and scholars often embarked on voyages between the two nations. Buddhist monks from India had been visiting Japan from the 8th century. Ancient records from the now-destroyed library at Nalanda University in India describe scholars and pupils who attended the school from Japan. One of the most famous Japanese travellers to the Indian subcontinent was Tenjiku Tokubei (1612–1692), named after "Tenjiku" ("Heavenly Abode"), the Japanese name for India.
The cultural exchanges between the two countries created many parallels in their folklore. Modern popular culture based upon this folklore, such as works of fantasy fiction in manga and anime, sometimes bear references to common deities (deva), demons (asura) and philosophical concepts. The Indian goddess Saraswati for example, is known as Benzaiten in Japan. Brahma, known as 'Bonten', and Yama, known as 'Enma', are also part of the traditional Japanese Buddhist pantheon. In addition to the common Buddhist influence on the two societies, Shintoism, being an animist religion, is similar to the animist strands of Hinduism, in contrast to the religions present in the rest of the world, which are monotheistic. Sanskrit, a classical language used in Buddhism and Hinduism, is still used by some ancient Chinese priests who immigrated to Japan, and the Siddhaṃ script is still written to this day, despite having passed out of usage in India. It is also thought that the distinctive torii gateways at temples in Japan, may be related to the torana gateways used in Indian temples.
In the 16th century, Japan established political contact with Portuguese colonies in India. The Japanese initially assumed that the Portuguese were from India and that Christianity was a new "Indian faith". These mistaken assumptions were due to the Indian city of Goa being a central base for the Portuguese East India Company and also due to a significant portion of the crew on Portuguese ships being Indian Christians. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, Indian "lascar" seamen frequently visited Japan as crew members aboard Portuguese ships, and later aboard British ships in the 18th and 19th centuries.
During the anti-Christian persecutions in 1596, many Japanese Christians fled to the Portuguese colony of Goa in India. By the early 17th century, there was a community of Japanese traders in Goa in addition to Japanese slaves brought by Portuguese ships from Japan.
Relations between the two nations have continued since then, but direct political exchange began only in the Meiji era (1868–1912), when Japan embarked on the process of modernisation. Japan-India Association was founded in 1903. Further cultural exchange occurred during the mid-late 20th century through Asian cinema, with Indian cinema and Japanese cinema both experiencing a "golden age" during the 1950s and 1960s. Indian films by Satyajit Ray, Guru Dutt and Rajinikanth were influential in Japan, while Japanese films by Akira Kurosawa, Yasujirō Ozu and Takashi Shimizu have likewise been influential in India.
Indian Independence Movement.
Japan’s emergence as a power in the early 20th century was positively viewed in India and symbolised what was seen as the beginning of an Asian resurgence. In India, there was great admiration for Japan’s post-war economic reconstruction and subsequent rapid growth.
Sureshchandra Bandopadhyay, Manmatha Nath Ghosh and Hariprova Takeda were among the earliest Indians who visited Japan and had written on their experiences there. Correspondences between distinguished individuals from both nations had a noticeable increase at the time; historical documents show a friendship between Japanese thinker Okakura Tenshin and Indian writer Rabindranath Tagore, Okakura Tenshin and Bengali poet Priyamvada Banerjee. As part of the British Empire, many Indians resented the British rule. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance was ended on 17 August 1923. As a result, during the two World Wars, the INA adopted the "an enemy of our enemy is our friend" attitude, legacy that is still controversial today given the war crimes committed by Imperial Japan and its allies.
Many Indian independence movement activists escaped from British rule and stayed in Japan. The leader of the Indian Independence Movement, Rash Behari Bose created India–Japan relations. Future prime minister Tsuyoshi Inukai, pan-Asianist Mitsuru Tōyama and other Japanese supported the Indian Independence movement. A. M. Nair, a student from India, became an Independence Movement activist. Nair supported Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose during the war and Justice Radha Binod Pal after the war.
In 1899 Tokyo Imperial University set up a chair in Sanskrit and Pali, with a further chair in Comparative religion being set up in 1903. In this environment, a number of Indian students came to Japan in the early twentieth century, founding the Oriental Youngmen's Association in 1900. Their anti-British political activity caused consternation to the Indian Government, following a report in the London Spectator.
During World War II.
Since India was under British rule when World War II broke out, it was deemed to have entered the war on the side of the Allies. Over 2 million Indians participated in the war; many served in combat against the Japanese who conquered Burma and reached the Indian border. Some 67,000 Indian soldiers were captured by the Japanese when Singapore surrendered in 1942, many of whom later became part of the Indian National Army. In 1944-45, the combined British and Indian forces defeated the Japanese in a series of battles in Burma.
Indian National Army.
Subhas Chandra Bose, who led the Azad Hind, a militant movement which aimed to end the British raj through military means, used Japanese sponsorship to form the Azad Hind Fauj or "Indian National Army" (INA). The INA was composed mainly of former prisoners of war from the British Indian Army who had been captured by the Japanese after the fall of Singapore. They joined primarily because of the very harsh conditions in POW camps. The INA also recruited volunteers from Indian expatriates in Southeast Asia. Large number of Tamilians working in Southeast Asian countries enrolled themselves with the INA. Bose was eager for the INA to participate in any invasion of India, and persuaded several Japanese that a victory such as Mutaguchi anticipated would lead to the collapse of British rule in India. The idea that their western boundary would be controlled by a more friendly government was attractive. It would also have been consistent with the idea, put about by Japanese propaganda, that Japanese expansion into Asia was part of an effort to support Asian government of Asia and against western colonialism.
The Japanese Government supported the Indian National Army and the Indian Independence League during India's fight for independence. India and Japan concluded loan agreements for Indian independence war. Japanese forces fought alongside the Indian National Army in many battles, most notably at the U Go Offensive at Manipur. The offensive culminated in Battles of Imphal and Kohima where the Japanese and their allies were first held and then pushed back. India and Japan participated Greater East Asia Conference with other Asian countries in 1943, they declared working for the abolition of racial discrimination. In view of common Japanese discrimination against the Chinese and Koreans, however, it is uncertain how seriously the Japanese meant this. Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands which were under the British rule, were returned to India by Japan. In 1944, Subhas Chandra Bose sent Indian youth cadets to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy or Imperial Japanese Army Air Force Academy to train as future pilots.
Modern relations.
At the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Indian Justice Radhabinod Pal became famous for his dissenting judgement in favour of Japan. The judgement of Justice Radhabinod Pal is remembered even today in Japan. This became a symbol of the close ties between India and Japan.
A relatively well-known result of the two nations' was in 1949, when India sent the Tokyo Zoo two elephants to cheer the spirits of the defeated Japanese empire. It was Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's decision to send the elephants to give joy rides to Japanese children, a gesture that the Japanese loved.
Many in Japan also remember India’s refusal to attend the San Francisco Peace Conference in 1951 due to its concerns over limitations imposed upon Japanese sovereignty and national independence. After the restoration of Japan's sovereignty, Japan and India signed a peace treaty, establishing official diplomatic relations on 28 April 1952, in which India waived all reparation claims against Japan. This treaty was one of the first treaties Japan signed after World War II. Diplomatic, trade, economic, and technical relations between India and Japan were well established. India's iron ore helped Japan's recovery from World War II devastation, and following Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's visit to India in 1957, Japan started providing yen loans to India in 1958, as the first yen loan aid extended by Japanese government. Relations between the two nations were constrained, however, by Cold War politics. Japan, as a result of World War II reconstruction, was a U.S. ally, whereas India pursued a non-aligned foreign policy, often leaning towards the Soviet Union. Since the 1980s, however, efforts were made to strengthen bilateral ties. India’s ‘Look East’ policy posited Japan as a key partner. Since 1986, Japan has become India's largest aid donor, and remains so.
Relations between the two nations reached a brief low in 1998 as a result of Pokhran-II, an Indian nuclear weapons test that year. Japan imposed sanctions on India following the test, which included the suspension of all political exchanges and the cutting off of economic assistance. These sanctions were lifted three years later. Relations improved exponentially following this period, as bilateral ties between the two nations improved once again, to the point where the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe was to be the chief guest at India's 2014 Republic Day parade.
Economic.
In August 2000, Japanese Prime Minister Mori visited India. At this meeting, Japan and India agreed to establish "Japan-India Global Partnership in the 21st Century." Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee visited Japan in December, 2001, where both Prime Ministers issued "Japan-India Joint Declaration", consisting of high-level dialogue, economic co-operation, and military and anti-terrorism co-operation. In April, 2005, Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi visited India and signed Joint Statement "Japan-India Partnership in the New Asian Era: Strategic Orientation of Japan-India Global Partnership" with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Japan is currently India’s third largest source of foreign direct investment; Japanese companies have made cumulative investments of around $2.6 billion in India since 1991. The 2007 annual survey conducted by the Japan Bank for International Co-operation ranked India as the most promising overseas investment destination for Japanese companies over the long term. In recent years, Japan has assisted India in infrastructure development projects such as the Delhi Metro Rail Project. Both sides are discussing the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project and Dedicated Freight Corridor Projects on the Mumbai-Delhi and the Delhi-Howrah routes. The Japanese government has also expressed interest to help establish a Chennai-Bangalore Industrial corridor and a Dedicated Freight project in the south, connecting the cities of Bangalore and Chennai.
In October 2008, Japan signed an agreement with India under which it would provide the latter a low-interest loan worth US$4.5 billion to construct a railway project between Delhi and Mumbai. This is the single largest overseas project being financed by Japan and reflected growing economic partnership between the two nations. India is also one of the only three countries in the world with whom Japan has security pact, the other two being Australia and the United States. As of March 2006, Japan was the third largest investor in India with an estimated total investment of US$2.12 billion.
Kenichi Yoshida, a director of Softbridge Solutions Japan, stated in late 2009 that Indian engineers were becoming the backbone of Japan's IT industry and that "it [] important for Japanese industry to work together with India." In November 2009, the Japanese steel manufacturer JFE Steel agreed to partner with JSW Steel, India's third-largest steel producer, to construct a joint steel plant in West Bengal.
During Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Japan in 2010, both countries agreed to foster increased business exchanges, people-to-people contact and signed a memorandum of understanding to simplify visa procedures for each other's citizens. Under the memorandum, any Japanese coming to India for business or work will be straightway granted a three-year visa and similar procedures will be followed by Japan. Other highlights of this visit includes abolition of customs duties on 94 per cent of trade between the two nations over the next decade. As per the agreement, tariffs will be removed on almost 90 per cent of Japan's exports to India and 97 per cent of India's exports to Japan
Trade between the two nations has also steadily been growing:
On 26 October 2010, Japan and India concluded negotiations on a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement(CEPA).The CEPA Agreement between India and Japan signed in Feb,2011 and entered into force in August, 2011 is expected to double the India-Japan Bilateral Trade to US$ 25 billion by 2014.
Military.
India and Japan also have close military ties. They have shared interests in maintaining the security of sea-lanes in the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean, and in co-operation for fighting international crime, terrorism, piracy and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The two nations have frequently held joint military exercises and co-operate on technology. India and Japan concluded a security pact on 22 October 2008.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is seen by some to be an "Indophile" and, with rising tensions in territorial disputes with Japan's neighbors, has advocated closer security cooperation with India.
Cultural.
Japan and India have strong cultural ties, based mainly on Japanese Buddhism, which remains widely practiced through Japan today. The two nations announced 2007, the 50th anniversary year of Indo-Japan Cultural Agreement, as the Indo-Japan Friendship and Tourism-Promotion Year, holding cultural events in both the countries.
Osamu Tezuka, "kamisama" of manga wrote biographical manga "Buddha" from 1972 to 1983. Recently, Japan has also supported the reconstruction of Nalanda University, an ancient Buddhist centre of learning and has agreed to provide financial assistance, and recently approached the Indian government with a proposal.
Bollywood has become more popular among the Japanese people in recent decades, and the Indian yogi and pacifist Dhalsim is one of the most popular characters in the Japanese video game series "Street Fighter".

Azzurro

Azzurro is an Italian pop song composed by Paolo Conte and Michele Virano. Its most famous version was recorded by Adriano Celentano in 1968.
Conte wrote the song together with Vito Pallavicini especially for Celentano. Together with "Via con me" and "Sotto le stelle del Jazz", it is one of his most famous works. The song is about love, loneliness and summer in the city. The song is typical for Conte's way of writing, combining simple melodies with catchy but unusual compositions; here he combines military march music with an everyday story, told in a poetic language full of images. Although typical, it is from Conte's early work with pop songs and not resembling his style later on. He recorded the song himself in 1985, not until having had a 10-year solo career as a singer.
Lyrics.
The first line of the song goes: "Azzurro, il pomeriggio e troppo azzurro e lungo per me . . ."
Cover versions.
The song was covered by numerous Italian singers, like Mina, Gianni Morandi and Fiorello. Even the Italian football national team has sung the song on one occasion. German covers were done by Peter Rubin, Dieter Thomas Kuhn, Die Toten Hosen and Peter Alexander.
Arik Einstein cover.
In Israel, it is a famous song known for its Hebrew version by Arik Einstein "Amru Lo" (Hebrew: "They told him..."), which does not feature a translation of the original lyrics, and instead lampoons a young ne'er-do-well's inexplicable obsession with the color red and a failing soccer team of the same uniform color. It was also turned as a film with the same name.
Die Toten Hosen cover.
"Azzurro" (on many releases mistitled "Azzuro") was covered by Die Toten Hosen for the album "Auf dem Kreuzzug ins Glück" as a tribute to 1990 FIFA World Cup.
The single was released with differently coloured covers: green, orange, pink and yellow.
Music video.
The video was directed by Hanns Christian Müller.
The band drives around Italy in an Opel, having to push-start it every time. In the end it gets stolen right before them.

The Hunger Games

The Hunger Games is a 2008 science fiction novel by the American writer Suzanne Collins. It is written in the voice of 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the dystopian, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem in North America. The Capitol, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games are an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12–18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death.
The book received mostly positive feedback from major reviewers and authors. It was praised for its storyline and character development, though some reviewers have noted similarities between Collins' book and Koushun Takami's "Battle Royale" (1999). In writing "The Hunger Games", Collins drew upon Greek mythology, Roman gladiatorial games, and contemporary reality television for thematic content. The novel won many awards, including the California Young Reader Medal, and was named one of "Publishers Weekly"'s "Best Books of the Year" in 2008.
"The Hunger Games" was first published in hardcover on September 14, 2008, by Scholastic, featuring a cover designed by Tim O'Brien. It has since been released in paperback and also as an audiobook and ebook. After an initial print of 200,000, the book had sold 800,000 copies by February 2010. Since its release, "The Hunger Games" has been translated into 26 languages, and publishing rights have been sold in 38 territories. The novel is the first in "The Hunger Games" trilogy, followed by "Catching Fire" (2009) and "Mockingjay" (2010). A film adaptation, directed by Gary Ross and co-written and co-produced by Collins herself, was released in 2012.
Background.
Collins has said that the inspiration for "The Hunger Games" came from channel surfing on television. On one channel she observed people competing on a reality show and on another she saw footage of the invasion of Iraq. The two "began to blur in this very unsettling way" and the idea for the book was formed. The Greek myth of Theseus served as a major basis for the story, with Collins describing Katniss as a futuristic Theseus, and Roman gladiatorial games provided the framework. The sense of loss that Collins developed through her father's service in the Vietnam War was also an influence on the story, with Katniss having lost her father at age 11, five years before the story begins. Collins stated that the deaths of young characters and other "dark passages" were the most difficult parts of the book to write, but that she had accepted that passages such as these were necessary to the story. She considered the moments where Katniss reflects on happier moments in her past to be more enjoyable.
Plot.
"The Hunger Games" takes place in a nation known as Panem, established in North America after the destruction of the continent's civilization by an unknown apocalyptic event. The nation consists of the wealthy Capitol and twelve surrounding, poorer districts united under the Capitol's control. District 12, where the book begins, is located in the coal-rich region that was formerly known as Appalachia.
As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol, in which a 13th district was destroyed, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, an event in which the participants (or "tributes") must fight to the death in an outdoor arena controlled by the Capitol, until only one individual remains. The story is narrated by 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, a girl from District 12 who volunteers for the 74th annual Hunger Games in place of her younger sister, Primrose. The male tribute chosen from District 12 is Peeta Mellark, a former schoolmate of Katniss who once gave her bread from his family's bakery when her family was starving.
Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, where their drunken mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, victor of the 50th Hunger Games, instructs them to watch and determine the strengths and weaknesses of the other tributes. "Stylists" are employed to make each tribute look his or her best; Katniss's stylist, Cinna, is the only person at the Capitol with whom she feels a degree of understanding. The tributes are publicly displayed to the Capitol audience in an interview with television host Caesar Flickerman, and have to attempt to appeal to the television audience in order to obtain "sponsors". During this time, Peeta reveals on-air his longtime unrequited love for Katniss. Katniss believes this to be a ploy to gain sponsors, who can be critical to survival because of their ability to send gifts such as food, medicine, and tools to favored tributes during the Games.
While nearly half the tributes are killed in the first day of the Games, Katniss relies on her well-practiced hunting and survival skills to remain unharmed and concealed from the other tributes. A few days into the Games, Katniss develops an alliance with Rue, a 12-year-old girl from the agricultural District 11 who reminds Katniss of her own sister. In the meantime, Peeta appears to have joined forces with the tributes from the richer districts. However, when he has the opportunity to kill Katniss, he instead saves her from the others. Katniss's alliance with Rue is brought to an abrupt end when Rue is killed by another tribute, whom Katniss then kills in self-defence with an arrow. Katniss sings to Rue until she dies, and spreads flowers over her body as a sign of respect for Rue and disgust towards the Capitol.
Apparently because of Katniss and Peeta's image in the minds of the audience as "star-crossed lovers", a rule change is announced midway through the Games, allowing two tributes from the same district to win the Hunger Games as a couple. Upon hearing this, Katniss begins searching for Peeta. She eventually finds him, wounded and in hiding. As she nurses him back to health, she acts the part of a young girl falling in love to gain more favor with the audience and, consequently, gifts from her sponsors. When the couple remains as the last two surviving tributes, the Gamemakers reverse the rule change in an attempt to force them into a dramatic finale, in which one must kill the other to win. Katniss, knowing that the Gamemakers would rather have two victors than none, retrieves highly poisonous berries known as "nightlock" from her pouch and offers some to Peeta. Realizing that Katniss and Peeta intend to commit suicide, the Gamemakers announce that both will be the victors of the 74th Hunger Games.
Although she survives the ordeal in the arena and is treated to a hero's welcome in the Capitol, Katniss is warned by Haymitch that she has now become a political target after defying her society's authoritarian leaders so publicly. Afterwards, Peeta is heartbroken when he learns that Katniss's actions in the arena were part of a calculated ploy to earn sympathy from the audience. However, Katniss is unsure of her own feelings and realizes that she is dreading the moment when she and Peeta will go their separate ways.
Themes.
In an interview with Collins, it was noted that the novel "tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war among others." The novel deals with the struggle for self-preservation that the people of Panem face in their districts and the Hunger Games in which they must participate. The citizens' starvation and their need for resources, both in and outside of the arena, create an atmosphere of helplessness that the main characters try to overcome in their fight for survival. Katniss needs to hunt to provide food for her family, resulting in the development of skills that are useful to her in the Games (such as her proficiency with the bow and arrow), and represents her rejection of the Capitol's rules in the face of life-threatening situations. On the subject of the Games' parallels with popular culture, Darren Franich of "Entertainment Weekly" writes that the book "is an incisive satire of reality television shows", and that the character of Cinna "almost seems like a contestant on a fascist version of "Project Runway", using Katniss' outfits as a vehicle to express potentially dangerous ideas."
The choices the characters make and the strategies they use are often morally complex. The tributes build a personality they want the audience to see throughout the Games. Library journal "Voice of Youth Advocates" names the major themes of "The Hunger Games" as "government control, 'big brother', and personal independence." The trilogy's theme of power and downfall, similar to that of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar", was pointed out by its publisher Scholastic. Laura Miller of "The New Yorker" finds the author's stated premise of the Games –an exercise in propaganda and a "humiliating as well as torturous [...] punishment" for a failed uprising against the Capitol many years earlier– to be unconvincing. "You don't demoralize and dehumanize a subject people by turning them into celebrities and coaching them on how to craft an appealing persona for a mass audience." But the story works much better if the theme is vicissitudes of high school and "the adolescent social experience". Miller writes:
"The rules are arbitrary, unfathomable, and subject to sudden change. A brutal social hierarchy prevails, with the rich, the good-looking, and the athletic lording their advantages over everyone else. To survive you have to be totally fake. Adults don't seem to understand how high the stakes are; your whole life could be over, and they act like it's just some "phase"! Everyone's always watching you, scrutinizing your clothes or your friends and obsessing over whether you're having sex or taking drugs or getting good enough grades, but no one cares who you really are or how you really feel about anything."
Donald Brake from "The Washington Times" and pastor Andy Langford state that the story has Christian themes, such as that of self-sacrifice, which is found in Katniss' substitution for her younger sister, analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus as a substitute for the atonement of sins. Brake, as well as another reviewer, Amy Simpson, both find that the story also revolves around the theme of hope, which is exemplified in the "incorruptible goodness of Katniss' sister, Primrose." Simpson also points to events similar to the Passion of Jesus; in the Games, "Christ figure" Peeta Mellark is stabbed after warning Katniss to flee for her life, and is then buried in the ground and placed in a cave for three days before emerging with a new lease on life. Further, she finds that the Christian image of the Bread of Life is used throughout "The Hunger Games"; in the story, Peeta gives Katniss a loaf of bread, saving the girl and her family from starvation.
Publication history.
After writing the novel, Collins signed a six-figure deal for three books with Scholastic in 2006. First published as a hardcover in the United States on September 14, 2008, "The Hunger Games" had a first printing of 50,000 copies, which was bumped up twice to 200,000 copies. By February 2010, the book had sold 800,000 copies, and rights to the novel had been sold in 38 territories worldwide. A few months later, in July, the book was released in paperback. "The Hunger Games" entered the "New York Times" Best Seller list in November 2008, where it would feature for over 100 consecutive weeks. By the time the film adaptation of "The Hunger Games" was released in March 2012, the book had been on "USA Today"s best-sellers list for 135 consecutive weeks.
The novel is the first in "The Hunger Games" trilogy; it is followed by sequels "Catching Fire" (2009) and "Mockingjay" (2010). In March 2012, during the time of "The Hunger Games" film's release, Scholastic reported 26 million "Hunger Games" trilogy books in print, including movie tie-in books. "The Hunger Games" (and also its sequels) have sold exceptionally well in ebook format. Suzanne Collins is the first children's or young adult author to sell over one million Amazon Kindle ebooks, making her the sixth author to join the "Kindle Million Club". In March 2012, Amazon announced that Collins had become the best-selling Kindle ebook author of all time.
An audiobook version of "The Hunger Games" was released in December 2008. Read by the actress Carolyn McCormick, it has a total running time of eleven hours and fourteen minutes. The magazine "AudioFile" said: "Carolyn McCormick gives a detailed and attentive narration. However, she may rely too much on the strength of the prose without providing the drama young adult listeners often enjoy." "School Library Journal" also praised the audiobook, stating that "McCormick ably voices the action-packed sequences and Katniss's every fear and strength shines through, along with her doomed growing attraction to one of her fellow Tributes."
The Tim O'Brien-designed cover features a gold "mockingjay" – a fictional bird in "The Hunger Games" born by crossbreeding female mockingbirds and genetically engineered male "jabberjays" – with an arrow engraved in a circle. This is a depiction of the pin worn by Katniss into the arena, given to her by the District 12 mayor's daughter, Madge Undersee. The image matches the description of the pin that is given in the novel, except for the arrow: "It's as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips."
Critical reception.
"The Hunger Games" has received critical acclaim. In a review for "The New York Times", John Green wrote that the novel was "brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced", and that "the considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins's convincingly detailed world-building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine." However, he also noted that, while allegorically rich, the book sometimes does not realize the allegorical potential that the plot has to offer and that the writing "described the action and little else." "Time" magazine's review was also positive, stating that it "is a chilling, bloody and thoroughly horrifying book" and praising what it called the "hypnotic" quality of the violence. In Stephen King's review for "Entertainment Weekly", he compared it to "shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway." However, he stated that there were "displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults" and that the love triangle was standard for the genre. He gave the book an overall B grade. Elizabeth Bird of "School Library Journal" praised the novel, saying it is "exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns", and called it one of the best books of 2008. "Booklist" also gave a positive review, praising the character violence and romance involved in the book. "Kirkus Reviews" gave a positive review, praising the action and world-building, but pointed out that "poor copyediting in the first printing will distract careful readers–a crying shame". Rick Riordan, author of the "Percy Jackson & the Olympians" series, claims it is the "closest thing to a perfect adventure novel" he has ever read. Stephenie Meyer (author of the "Twilight" series) endorsed the book on her website, saying, "I was so obsessed with this book …
"The Hunger Games" is amazing."
The novel has been criticized for its similarities to the 1999 novel "Battle Royale", by Koushun Takami. Collins has stated, "I had never heard of that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was mentioned to me, and I asked my editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing'." Susan Dominus of "The New York Times" reports that "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff," but argued that "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." King noted that the reality TV "badlands" were similar to "Battle Royale", as well as his own "The Running Man" and "The Long Walk". Eric Eisenberg wrote that "The Hunger Games" was "not a rip off "Battle Royale", but simply a different usage of a similar idea", pointing out various differences in both story and themes. Robert Nishimura wrote that ""The Hunger Games" has an entirely different set of cultural baggage ... Collins just happened to tap in to the creative collective consciousness, drawing on ideas that have played out many times before, in addition to her intentional reference to Greek mythology." The novel has also been controversial with parents; it ranked in fifth place on the American Library Association's list of frequently challenged books for 2010, with "unsuited to age group" and "violence" being among the reasons cited.
"The Hunger Games" received many awards and honors. It was named one of "Publishers Weekly" "Best Books of the Year" in 2008 and a "The New York Times" "Notable Children's Book of 2008". It was the 2009 winner of the Golden Duck Award in the Young Adult Fiction Category. "The Hunger Games" was also a "2008 Cybil Winner" for fantasy and science-fiction books along with "The Graveyard Book". It is also one of "School Library Journal"'s "Best Books 2008" and a "Booklist Editors' Choice" in 2008. In 2011, the book won the California Young Reader Medal. In the 2012 edition of Scholastic's "Parent and Child" magazine, "The Hunger Games" was listed as the 33rd-best book for children, with the award for "Most Exciting Ending". The novel is one of the top 5 best selling Kindle books of all time.

In March 2009, Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement for "The Hunger Games" with Nina Jacobson's production company Color Force, which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier. The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000 – one of its largest ever – for the film. Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that "they had everyone but the valet call us" to help secure the franchise. Intending the film to have a PG-13 rating, Collins adapted the novel for film herself, in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he "felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective" in its presentation of events, echoing Collins' use of first person present in the novel.
Twenty-year-old actress Jennifer Lawrence was chosen to play Katniss Everdeen. Though Lawrence was four years older than the character when filming began, Collins felt the role demanded "a certain maturity and power" and said she would rather the actress be older than younger. She added that Lawrence was the "only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book" and that she had "every essential quality necessary to play Katniss." Lawrence, a fan of the books, took three days to accept the role, initially intimidated by the size of the production. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth were later added to the cast, in the roles of Peeta and Gale, respectively. Production began in late spring 2011 and the film was released on March 23, 2012. The film's opening weekend brought in a non-sequel record $152.5 million (USD) in North America. "", based on the second novel in the series, was released the following year on November 22, 2013.

Commonwealth Railways NC class

The NC class were a class of diesel-hydraulic locomotives built by Clyde Engineering, Granville for the Lakewood Firewood Company, Kalgoorlie in 1956 and later sold to the Commonwealth Railways.
Description.
Clyde Engineering advertised the DH series as a light purpose shunt and mainline locomotive, mainly for light railways and sugar cane service. The design allowed for multiple unit operation, the installation of dynamic brakes and a combination of air and vacuum braking systems. Similar, though smaller versions were being built by Clyde. These were the DH1-71 series and totaled 33.
A single General Motors 6/110 two stroke diesel engine provided power through an Allison CRT5630 hydraulic transmission to mechanically coupled wheels. Cabs consisted of two control consoles, both facing the same direction. Maximum design speed was 60km/h.
History.
The Lakewood Firewood Company (LFC) provided timber to the various mines in the "Golden Mile" region of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. Its operations extended to the south and east of Kalgoorlie. This area covered from Kalgoorlie to Lake Lefroy and the Eyre Highway.
At the time of ordering, the LFC were using an aging fleet of small steam locomotives. But by the time the locomotives were delivered, the company were in the middle of a rapid decline for demand for wood as mines closed or switched power sources.
By the time they were delivered, traffic on the LFC network had fallen from two trains a day, to two trains a week. Their introduction led to the end of steam operations on the railway, although they were unpopular with crews "only because they were die-hard steam men". By 1962, the company employed less than 50 people, a far cry from the 550 employed at its peak. The last train ran on December 1964, to clean up the system. All of its rollingstock, except the two diesels, were scrapped. 
Commonwealth Railways purchased the two locomotives in 1965. LFC1 was renumbered NC1 and spent time in Port Augusta workshops where the braking systems were modified for the Westinghouse air brake systems, the modified air intake system was removed. In November 1966 it was shipped north to Darwin, where it was employed as yard shunter on the North Australia Railway. It returned south in 1972.
NC2 was used as yard shunter in Port Augusta until 1970, until NB30, returned from duties on the Hawker line. Subsequently, NC1 replaced NB30 as yard shunter in 1972, with NC2 being used as a source of spare parts.
In July 1975 both were included in the transfer of the Commonwealth Railways to Australian National.
By 1982, NC1 had become more or less obsolete. The need to maintain a narrow gauge yard shunter at Port Augusta had diminished with the closure of the Central Australia Railway in 1980. In July 1982, NC2 was sold to the Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society, and in 1985, NC1 was transferred to the now defunct Steamtown.
Preservation.
NC1.
NC1 remained in Port Augusta until 1985. Australian National approached Steamtown to gauge availability of a number of tanker wagons that had been collected in Peterborough. At the time, Australian National was handling increasing quantities of Mereenie Crude oil. A deal was struck that saw Steamtown exchange its tanker wagons for NC1 with the locomotive arriving in Peterborough on 15 April 1985.
NC1 went on to be the pivotal engine for the organisation. It hauled a number of passenger trains when steam was not available, was often seen running work trains on the line, and when not hauling passenger trains, provided back up power and braking capacity. 
Whilst assisting with the recovery of W901, which had derailed in Eurelia Yard in early 1988, the "rear drive assembly" seized, and required major work. This was reported as being completed by mid-1991.
Steamtown initially painted the locomotive in the "Invisible Green" scheme associated with the Peterborough Division, but in 1998, it was repainted in Commonwealth Railways livery The locomotive is today part of the Steamtown Heritage Rail Centre in Peterborough.
NC2.
In July 1982, NC2 was railed to Stirling North and transferred to the Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society, Quorn.
It was stripped of its motor and other mechanical devices, and "child-proofed". It was repainted in LFC colours and in November 1982, was trucked to Port Lincoln, where she replaced Yx141 as a playground fixture in Hermitage Park.
Despite being described as a "public toilet", NC2 remains in Port Lincoln. During 2008, the Council undertook work to enclose the cab and to tidy the hulk for child safety purposes.

Indian Heaven Wilderness

Indian Heaven Wilderness is a protected area located inside the Gifford Pinchot National Forest of southwestern Washington state. The wilderness consists of some 20,960 acres (85 km2) of broad, forested plateau, with meadows straddling numerous volcanic peaks and at least 150 small lakes, ponds, and marshes. The wilderness also contains the Indian Heaven volcanic field. Originally known to the Indians as "Sahalee Tyee," the area has been and remains culturally important to Native Americans. During the past 9,000 years, the Yakima, Klickitat, Cascades, Wasco, Wishram, and Umatilla tribes gathered in this area for berry picking, fishing, and hunting. 
Landforms.
The wilderness consists of some of forested plateau, with meadows and at least 150 small lakes, ponds, and marshes. The wilderness also contains the Indian Heaven volcanic field. Lava once flowed from the numerous volcanic cones that rise above the plateau, consisting mainly of overlapping shield volcanoes, spatter cones, and cinder cones, which averages in elevation. The wilderness' highest point is Lemei Rock (5,927 ft), whose crater now contains Lake Wapiki. Some of the most prominent volcanic peaks include Lemei Rock, Bird Mountain, Sawtooth Mountain, Gifford Peak, East Crater, and Red Mountain. Big Lava Bed is the result of the most recent volcanic activity about 8,200 years ago.
Geology.
Lemei Rock is one of the many shield volcanoes topped by cinder cones and spatter cones that make up the Indian Heaven Volcanic Field. About 60 eruptive centers lie on the long, N10°E-trending, Indian Heaven fissure zone. The field has a volume of about and forms the western part of a Quaternary basalt field in the southern Washington Cascades, including the King Mountain fissure zone along which Mount Adams was built.
Fauna.
Deer and elk reside in the wilderness area until winter snows drive them lower, along with black bears attracted to the abundant ripening of fall huckleberries. Numerous bird species reside in the wilderness along with various small forest animals, such as chipmunks.
Plant Life.
The forest conifers consist mainly of Subalpine Fir and Douglas Fir. The area (including the Sawtooth Berry Fields) is known for its abundant huckleberries in mid-August to Early September. They grow abundantly in the old, fire-scarred forest meadows burned in the past by Natives to stimulate more huckleberry production.
Recreation.
The Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail passes north/south through the wilderness, which is known for its many lakes and spectacular views of four nearby volcanoes: Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Rainier. It is also known to hikers for an intense population of mosquitoes throughout the summer. Other major trails in the area are Indian Heaven Trail and the Cultus Creek Trail, which climbs up the east side of Bird Mountain; and Lemei Trail which traverses up the east side of Lemei Rock and passes by Lake Wapiki. In late fall, the huckleberry bushes provide excellent berries as well as intense orange color in some years.

Halesowen railway station

Halesowen railway station was a railway station in Halesowen, England, on the Great Western Railway & Midland Railway's Joint Halesowen Railway line from Old Hill to Longbridge. 
History.
The station opened in 1878, but it had a very short life in terms of passenger services. All of the station and lines passenger services ceased in 1927, all but a few factory worker trains that served the Austin Rover Works in Longbridge.
The station had yard faculties and a small branch to the Hawne Basin on the Dudley Canal, with freight services continuing until the closure of the line in 1964. The last workers trains left in 1960 and this was the end of the station and line.
Present.
Today the track bed is still in place but there is no sign of Halesowen’s railway station. The station site is an industrial site on the bottom of Mucklows Hill (which used to pass over the railway line on a bridge) next to Halesowen College.

West Point is a township (the administrative equivalent of a city ward) of the Liberian capital city of Monrovia, located on a peninsula which juts out into the Atlantic Ocean between the Mesurado and Saint Paul rivers. Home to approximately 75,000 people, it is one of Monrovia's most densely populated neighorhoods, and environmental degradation has gradually caused part of the peninsula to erode into the ocean. Endemic problems include overpopulation and diseases such as tuberculosis.
Sanitation.
The area lacks proper sanitation. The area lacks public toilets and a report by United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that there are four public toilets in the area. Pay toilets exist, but residents cannot afford them, and thus public defecation is common. The beach surrounding West Point is often used a lavatory which creates health hazards as the water is used for drinking and fish from the water are consumed.

Aylesbury High Street railway station

Aylesbury High Street railway station was the London and North Western Railway station which served the town of Aylesbury in the English county of Buckinghamshire. It was the terminus of a branch from Cheddington on what is now known as the West Coast Main Line running to London Euston Station and to Birmingham New Street and further north.
Two stations were built, the first being used as a goods terminus after its closure to passengers.
History.
The first station at Aylesbury was opened by the Aylesbury Railway on 10 June 1839; this was closed on 16 June 1889 when it was replaced by the second station, also named "Aylesbury". The line was operated by the London and Birmingham Railway, and when that company amalgamated with others to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), the Aylesbury Railway was absorbed by the LNWR. The LNWR became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923, passing on to the London Midland Region of British Railways during the nationalisation of 1948. British Railways (BR) renamed the station "Aylesbury High Street" on 25 September 1950; it was then closed to passengers on 2 February 1953 and then freight on 2 December 1963.
Routes.
The only intermediate station between Aylesbury and Cheddington was at Marston Gate.
The site today.
The site is now occupied by an office block and a retail park. The route into Aylesbury has been taken over by a road named 'Stocklake' and 'Vale Park Drive' (part of the A418 road), although the formation remains mostly intact along the route of the road.

Hagelin, a quantum physicist, was the director of the Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy and director of the physics department at the Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa. Hagelin and Tompkins received ballot placement in 32 states and their campaign qualified for federal matching funds.
In 1996, Hagelin and Tompkins ran again as the presidential and vice presidential candidates on the Natural Law Party. During a campaign stop at the University of Houston, Tompkins defended the party’s place in the U.S. political landscape by stating, "The Natural Law Party was founded as an alternative to the Republicans and Democrats, and an answer to the great many issues and great many solutions that were not being brought to the public. We are building this party as a permanent part of the American political landscape. We want to win and influence debate…(America has) the least democratic society. We have made a political system that excludes new voices, new people and new ideas."
Hagelin and Tomkins received 39,000 votes, or 0.04% of the total voter input, in 1992. In 1996, they were on the ballot in 44 states and received 110,000 votes, or 0.1% of the total voter input. In 2000, Hagelin ran for president again on the Natural Law Party, but Tompkins was replaced as the vice presidential candidate by Internet entrepreneur Nat Goldhaber.

Jan Nederveen Pieterse

Jan Nederveen Pieterse is Mellichamp Professor of Global Studies and Sociology in the Global & International Studies Program at the University of California, Santa Barbara . He specializes in globalization, development studies and cultural studies. His books include:
Biography.
Nederveen Pieterse received his doctorate in cultural anthropology from the University of Nijmegen. He speaks Dutch, English, French, German, and Italian and is a noted scholar in the area of globalization and culture, particularly globalization and cultural hybridity.
Globalization and hegemony.
Nederveen Pieterse’s work on globalization involves several dimensions: empire and hegemony, global political economy, development studies, and culture.
Work on empire and hegemony includes the early study on "Empire and Emancipation" (1989). This large study includes kaleidoscopic takes on both empire—traced back to the classical empires, the Crusades, to the new imperialism and contemporary hegemony; and emancipation—with chapters on Native American liberation, African and black emancipation movements, and decolonization movements. Besides historical chapters, the work includes five theoretical chapters, two on empire, two on emancipation, and one on their dialectics.
The work on emancipation is taken further in an edited volume, "Emancipations, Modern and Postmodern" (1992) with contributions by Sandra Harding, Ernesto Laclau, Alberto Melucci, Sudipta Kaviraj, Bhikhu Parekh and others.
"Globalization or Empire?" (2004) continues this interest and combines hegemony and global political economy. The book features chapters on neoliberal globalization, neoliberal empire, globalization and war, global inequality, American exceptionalism, representations of North and South, and capitalisms after Enron.
These perspectives are also developed in (co-)edited volumes such as "Humanitarian Intervention and beyond: World Orders in the Making" (1998), "Global Futures: Shaping Globalization" (2000), "Globalization and Social Movements" (2001), "Politics of globalization" (2009) and "Globalization and Emerging Societies: Development and Inequality" (2009).
The interest in the limits of American hegemony is taken up in "Is there hope for Uncle Sam? Beyond the American Bubble" (2008) which includes chapters on social inequality in the United States, the financialization of the American economy, pending economic crisis and the rise of new emerging economies.
Development studies.
Another area of interest is development studies. The book "Development Theory: Deconstructions/ Reconstructions" (2001) has been used widely as a textbook from Scandinavia to South Korea and has gone through six printings. A new edition is appearing in 2009. The book combines global political economy with development policy with critical, probing chapters on alternative development, post-development, culture and development and futures of development thinking.
Globalization and culture.
Nederveen Pieterse’s first major work on culture and representation is the 1992 study "White on Black: Images of Africa and Blacks in Western Popular Culture". This interest is developed further in a volume co-edited with Bhikhu Parekh, "The Decolonization of Imagination" (1997).
Particularly well known is Nederveen Pieterse’s work on hybridity. The often cited article on ‘Globalization as Hybridization’ appears in his volume "Globalization and Culture: Global Mélange" (2003). A second edition appears in 2009. A sequel study is "Ethnicities and Global Multiculture: Pants for an Octopus" (2007) with probing treatments of ethnicity, social capital, multiculturalism, Islam and cosmopolitanism.
Globalization and Hybridity Theory.
The term 'hybridity' originates with agriculture but has recently become very significant to Cultural Studies. Originating from the Latin "hybrida", a hybrid is simply anything that is mixed. Key thinkers in the development of Hybridity Theory (HT) include Homi K. Bhabha, Stuart Hall, Gayatri Spivak, and Paul Gilroy. For Nederveen Pieterse, the concept of hybridity serves as a hermeneutical tool for interpreting the cultural dimensions of globalization. While most assessments of globalization are confined to a narrow time frame (modernity), Nederveen Pieterse considers globalization in broader anthropological terms. In this sense, he argues that globalization “belongs to a deep dynamic in which shifting civilizational centers are but the front stage of history” with ongoing intercultural traffic forming the backdrop. While globalization is often dismissed as mere westernization, Nederveen Pieterse points out that from an evolutionary perspective, such analysis is historically shallow:
The evolutionary backdrop of our common origins in Africa confirms that humanity is a hybrid species. The species' subsequent “clustering” in different regions of the world has not precluded large-scale contact and population movements across and between continents (Gamble 1993). This mixed heritage is confirmed by the “cultures” identified by archaeologists which in Paleolithic and Neolithic times sprawl widely and do not coincide with the boundaries of much later times.
New trends in globalization.
With contemporary globalization comes new dialectics of borders. Increasing transnationalism in communication, production, consumption and travel goes together with the emergence of new borders (as in rising restrictions on migration) and new politics of risk containment (as in relation to conflict areas). As some borders fade new ones and or internal boundaries emerge; besides the advantages of the erasure of boundaries are not evenly distributed. Contemporary globalization can be understood as a process of hierarchical integration in which integration (the spread of global capitalism and its political and cultural radius) fosters borderlessness while hierarchy imposes new boundaries and forms of stratification.

Willie Johnston (Medal of Honor)

William "Willie" Johnston (born July 1850), from St. Johnsbury, Vermont, was a drummer boy in Company D of the 3rd Vermont Infantry. His service during the Seven Days retreat in the Peninsula Campaign was exemplary. He was the only drummer in his division to come away with his instrument, during a general rout. His superiors considered this a meritorious feat, when fellow soldiers had thrown away their guns. As a result, he received the Medal of Honor on the recommendation of his division commander, thereby becoming the youngest recipient of the highest decoration at 13 years of age.
Early life.
Johnston was born in Morristown, New York in 1850. (Note - His birthplace is also listed as Warrentown in St. Lawrence County, N.Y.) Apparently his family moved to Salem, Vermont (now Derby). When his father enlisted in December, 1861, young Willie begged to go with him. The commanding officer agreed. He was enlisted as a drummer boy on December 11, 1861 in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. He was 11 years old and five feet tall.
The war.
Johnston enlisted as a drummer in Company D, 3d Vermont Infantry Regiment on May 1, 1862 and was mustered into United States service same day. His father, William Johnston, was a member of Company B of the same regiment.
Johnston's first fight was at Lee's Mill, Virginia, on April 16, 1862.
During his next campaign, the Seven Days Battles from June 25 to July 1, 1862, Johnston was cited for bravery. 
During that retreat many men threw away all their equipment so they would have less weight to carry. Johnston, however, retained his drum and brought it safely to Harrison's Landing. There, he had the honor of drumming for the division parade, he being the only drummer boy to bring his instrument off the battlefields. Johnston's division commander noted this fact and included them in his report. President Lincoln heard the story and wrote Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, suggesting the youth be given a medal. Stanton agreed, and Willie Johnston was presented his Medal of Honor September 16, 1863, at the age of 13, for a deed performed when he was but 11 years of age.
This was the second Medal of Honor ever awarded. Secretary Stanton presented the actual award.
Johnston re-enlisted at Brandy Station, Va. on February 15, 1864. He transferred to Company H, February 15, 1864, and then became Drum Major of the 20th Regiment of Veteran Reserve Corps. He was mustered out of service on December 30, 1864.
Nothing is known of his life after his discharge from the Army.
Medal of Honor citation.
Rank and organization: Musician, Company D, 3d Vermont Infantry. Place and date: Unknown. Entered service at: St. Johnsbury, Vt. Birth: Morristown, N.Y. Date of issue: 16 September 1863.
Citation:
Date and place of act not on record in War Department.
Historical note.
Until the establishment of the Medal of Honor there was only decoration presented in the United States Army - the original Purple Heart. However, since the Purple Heart had not been awarded since the Revolutionary War, and would not be used again until World War I, the Medal of Honor was effectively the only award available to U.S. military personnel at the time of the Civil War.

The Robert Llewellyn Wright House is a historic home located at 7927 Deepwell Drive in Bethesda, Maryland, United States. It is a two-story concrete-block structure designed by noted architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1953, and constructed in 1957 for his sixth child. The Usonian house was designed using intersecting and concentric segments of a circle, or "hemicycles". The house can be seen from Deepwell Drive on a sloping lot that overlooks a stream. It is also visible from the Cabin John Stream Valley Trail, which follows the Cabin John Creek below it. In 1960, the grounds were landscaped by the son of the architect, Lloyd Wright. 
It is one of only two Wright-designed structures in Maryland; the other is the Joseph Euchtman House in Baltimore County. The Robert Llewellyn Wright House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 12, 1986.

JWChat

JWChat is a web-based instant messaging client for the XMPP protocol. It is free software and users can run their own instant messaging equivalent of webmail without limitations or software cost, complimenting the XMPP philosophy of a distributed network. JWChat is interpreted purely by the client webbrowser. The program itself is static content. Although it can connect with traditional instant messengers such as AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ, it runs solely in a browser and does not require downloading or installation of additional software.
Proxying.
Because of JavaScript's same origin policy a JavaScript program (such as JWChat) can only communicate with the hosting webserver. All traffic must therefore be proxied by the webserver to the XMPP server.
A webserver such as Apache can be configured to act as a reverse proxy. An alternative to this relaying of traffic is to use a minimal webserver in the XMPP server such as the module included in ejabberd.

Campaign.
In 1996, Beshear started out trailing against McConnell, with an early general election poll placing McConnell ahead of Beshear 50% to 32%. The campaign ultimately became quite harsh, with the McConnell campaign sending "Hunt Man," a take off of Chicken George dressed in "the red velvet coat, jodhpurs, black riding boots and black helmet of a patrician fox hunter." This was done as a means of criticizing Beshear's membership in a fox hunting club in Lexington, and undercut the Beshear campaign's message that McConnell was a Republican in the mold of Newt Gingrich and that Beshear was the only friend of the working class in the race. Beshear did not make much traction with the electorate during the campaign. By October 1996, Beshear had narrowed the gap between himself and McConnell slightly, with McConnell leading Beshear 50% to 38%.

Ducor Hotel

The Ducor Palace Hotel is a building in Monrovia, the capital city of the African country of Liberia. The building overlooks the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Saint Paul River and Monrovia's West Point district. It is located on Ducor Hill, at the end of Broad Street across from United Nations Boulevard in Monrovia's main business district. Once a luxury hotel, the building has fallen into extensive disrepair.
Operated by the Intercontinental Hotels chain, the Ducor Hotel was the first international-class hotel constructed in Liberia, and was for many years one of the few five-star hotels in all of Africa. Its various amenities, including its three hundred rooms, pool, tennis courts, and a French restaurant, made it popular with tourists from the Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, as well as visiting professionals from the US, Europe, and Asia.
With political uncertainty looming, the Ducor Hotel closed in 1989, just before the coup led by Charles Taylor which ousted President Samuel Doe and marked the beginning of the First Liberian Civil War. The building endured much damage during this period, both due to the violence of the war and looting that occurred afterwards. During this time, displaced residents of many of Monrovia's slums began to occupy the hotel's empty rooms.
In 2007, the Liberian Ministry of Justice began to evict the Ducor Hotel's residents. 
In 2008, the Government of Liberia signed a lease agreement with the Government of Libya, who began clearing the property of debris in 2010 in preparation for a bidding process to be completed by June 2010. However, the project was delayed several times before finally being abandoned upon Liberia's severing of diplomatic relations with the Gaddafi government following the outbreak of the 2011 Libyan civil war.

Today, Russia's ambassador to Vanuatu is Aleksandr Blokhin (who is also an ambassador to Australia, and Russia's other non-resident embassies in Canberra such as Fiji, Nauru, and Tonga). In December 2011, Vanuatu appointed Thitam Goiset, "president" of the Nagriamel and John Frum movements and sister of "prominent businessman" Dinh Van Than, as ambassador to Russia.
Historical Relations.
Vanuatu, which became independent from France and the United Kingdom in 1980, was led by Prime Minister Father Walter Lini, founder of the doctrine of Melanesian socialism, from 1980 to 1991. Lini's foreign policy was one of non-alignment, manifested by Vanuatu joining the Non-Aligned Movement in 1983. His government was the only one in Oceania at the time which refused to align with the Western bloc during the dying stages of the Cold War. Lini sought to maintain cordial, though not particularly close, relations with the Soviet Union. There was never any suggestion of Vanuatu aligning with the Eastern bloc; Lini was not a Marxist, and there was no Communist Party in Vanuatu.
In 1987, Vanuatu authorised Soviet vessels to fish within Vanuatu's Exclusive Economic Zone, in exchange for economic aid. The agreement lapsed the following year, and was not renewed, due to disagreements over the price to be paid for fishing rights by the USSR.
The year 1991 was marked both by the end of Lini's last term in office and by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thereafter, relations between Port-Vila and Moscow were virtually non-existent.
In 2011, however, Vanuatu (under Prime Minister Sato Kilman) did follow Russia's lead in recognising the breakaway Georgian province of Abkhazia as a sovereign state. Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Carlot "offered little explanation for the decision did give hints. He said he had studied at Moscow’s diplomatic academy during Soviet days, and that Vanuatu’s foreign policy aims at “eradicating colonialism from the face of the earth.”"

Call It What You Want (New Kids on the Block song)

"Call It What You Want" is a 1990 song by New Kids on the Block. Written and produced by Maurice Starr, the original version appears on the groups third album "Step By Step." A club/house remix produced by Robert Clivillés & David Cole, which also featured a rap intro by Freedom Williams, later appeared on the groups 1990 hits compilation, "No More Games/The Remix Album" and would ultimately serve as the second single to be released from that album. The lead vocals were sung by Jordan Knight, Joey McIntyre, and Donnie Wahlberg. 
Release and reception.
Upon its release, the song was another single that received decent (though not enthusiastic) airplay in North America during the spring months of 1991 and could be considered the "last hurrah" in terms of singles from the group's initial run. The single peaked at #12 on the UK Singles Chart. While the group played this song in concert during their 1994 Face the Music Tour, it was not played again until the tour on March 7, 2009.

Dez Bryant

Desmond Demond Bryant (born November 4, 1988) is an American football wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Oklahoma State University, and earned All-American honors. He was chosen by the Dallas Cowboys number 24 overall in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft.
Early years.
Bryant was born in Galveston County, Texas, but eventually moved to Lufkin, Texas, where he attended Lufkin High School. As a junior, he caught 48 passes for 1,025 yards and 16 touchdowns. Bryant, along with defensive lineman Jamarkus McFarland, led Lufkin to a 14–1 record, including an appearance in the 5A Division II state semi-finals, where they lost 46–28 to Todd Dodge's Southlake Carroll. In his senior year, Bryant had 53 receptions for 1,207 yards with 21 touchdowns, and was an All-State selection. Lufkin finished the season 11–1, after losing 38–25 to Round Rock in the area round of the playoffs. After the season, Bryant participated in the Offense-Defense All-American Bowl. He was also named an All-American by "Parade" and SuperPrep.
Regarded as a four-star recruit by "Rivals.com", Bryant was listed as the No. 9 wide receiver prospect in the class of 2007, and the second from Texas behind only Terrence Toliver. Recruited by numerous major programs, including most Big 12 schools, Bryant took official visits to Texas A&M, Oklahoma State, and Texas Tech, before committing to the Cowboys. He was just the fourth "Parade" All-American to sign with OSU since 1985.
College career.
Bryant attended Oklahoma State University from 2007 to 2008 and was a member of the Oklahoma State Cowboys football team coached by Mike Gundy. As a freshman in 2007, he finished second on the team with 43 receptions for 622 yards and 6 touchdowns in 12 games. In a game against the University of Kansas Jayhawks, he set an OSU record for receiving yards in a game by a freshman with 155. In the 2007 Insight Bowl, he recorded 9 receptions for 117 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 49–33 win against the Indiana Hoosiers.
Bryant finished the 2008 season for Oklahoma State with 87 receptions for 1,480 yards and 19 touchdowns, including 2 punt returns for touchdowns. Bryant was ruled ineligible for the rest of the 2009 season on October 7 for violating an NCAA bylaw. He failed to fully disclose his interaction with Deion Sanders, a former NFL player, to the NCAA. He was considered the best receiver in 2009 and a possible Heisman contender before the suspension.
Professional career.
2010 NFL Draft.
On November 5, 2009, Bryant announced his intentions to enter the 2010 NFL Draft. He was widely believed to be the best wide receiver available in the draft, and was projected as high as the No. 1 pick overall in some mock drafts. Bryant was believed to be targeted by the Denver Broncos (11th pick overall), who traded their Pro Bowl receiver Brandon Marshall to the Miami Dolphins prior to the draft. If slipping by the Broncos, Bryant was projected to fall no lower than No. 27 to the Dallas Cowboys. Eventually the Cowboys traded their 27th overall pick to the New England Patriots for their 24th overall pick to select Bryant.
Dallas Cowboys.
2010.
Bryant was signed by the Cowboys to a contract very similar to that of Vikings wide receiver Percy Harvin (five years, $12.05 million, roughly $8.4 million guaranteed) on July 22, 2010. On July 23, 2010, it was announced that Bryant will wear number 88, the same as Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, and Cowboys legend Drew Pearson. On October 17, 2010, Bryant caught his first NFL touchdown catch, on a 31-yard pass from Tony Romo. The Cowboys ended up losing that game 24–21.
In a Monday Night Football game vs. the New York Giants, at Cowboys stadium on October 25, 2010, Bryant caught four passes for 54 yards, two of them for TDs, and also returned a punt 93 yards for a touchdown, making the longest Cowboys' punt return since Dennis Morgan's 98-yard return during the 1974 NFL season. On November 15, 2010, Bryant caught 3 passes for 104 yards and 1 touchdown, to become the first Cowboys rookie with a 100+ yard game since Antonio Bryant.
During the fourth quarter of the Cowboys' 38–35 victory over the Colts, Bryant went down with a fractured ankle. Indianapolis' Kavell Conner held onto Bryant's leg while tackling him on a kickoff return, and the Cowboys immediately took Bryant to the locker room. He was placed on the injured reserve list and had surgery on the fractured ankle. He left the game with one catch for 14 yards and a 35.7-yard average on three kickoff returns.
Bryant finished his rookie season with 45 receptions for 561 yards and 6 receiving touchdowns.
2011.
With the departure of Roy Williams, Bryant won the starting job opposite of Miles Austin.
Bryant started the first game of the 2011 season against the New York Jets where he had 3 receptions for 71 yards and a touchdown. Dallas lost the game.
Bryant missed the second game of the 2011 season against the San Francisco 49ers due to injury as the Cowboys won their game in overtime.
Bryant started his second game of the season against the division rivals and previously undefeated Washington Redskins on a Monday Night Football game. Playing injured, Bryant managed 4 receptions for 63 yards in that game helping his team to a win.
In the fourth game of the season against the, at the time, undefeated Detroit Lions, Bryant had 3 receptions for 37 yards, 1 rush for 5 yards and 2 receiving touchdowns in his team's loss. His 2 touchdown game marked just the second time in his career with multiple touchdowns in one game.
Against the New England Patriots Bryant had 4 receptions for 78 yards in a heartbreaking loss on the road.
In Week 7 of the 2011 regular season, the Dallas Cowboys went up against the St. Louis Rams at Cowboys Stadium. In the contest, Bryant had the most productive game of his season this far, hauling in 5 receptions for 90 yards and a touchdown, helping his team to a win. His 5 receptions that game ranked 4th most receptions in a game for his career and his 90 yards were his second most yards in a game of his career. His yardage output of the game also ranked as the most yards in a single game for his 2011 season. Bryant was not officially given the start for the game. Bryant's best game of the season was overshadowed by rookie teammate Demarco Murray's record-breaking day.
The 7th game of the season pinned the 3–3 Dallas Cowboys against the 2–4 Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Field. Bryant had just 3 receptions for 28 yards in a 34–7 loss. The 28 yards gained by Bryant was his lowest total yards in a game for the 2011 season through seven games.
The following week, against the Seattle Seahawks, Bryant recorded 4 receptions for 76 yards on 9 targets. Bryant also fumbled and lost the fumble, both for the first time in his career as he was tackled near the opponent's 1-yard line. The Cowboys got the win against the Seahawks 23–13. At the midway point of the season, Bryant had 26 receptions for 443 yards and 4 touchdowns on 6 starts. Similarly, in 2010 at the midway point of the season, Bryant had 38 receptions for 435 and 3 touchdowns on 2 starts.
Bryant finished the season with 63 receptions for 928 yards and 9 touchdowns.
2012.
Dez had a good start in the 2012 Season, bringing in 85 yards on only 4 catches (21.3 YPC/Yards Per Catch average) in a 24-17 win against division rivals, the New York Giants. 
The next two weeks were shaky at best, as he hauled in only 79 receiving yards on 9 receptions and no touchdowns. Dallas would lose the game in week 2 versus the Seattle Seahawks, and would go on to win in week 3 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
In the week 4 34-18 loss to the Chicago Bears, Dez would have a much better outing than the previous 3 games, as he caught for 105 yards on 8 receptions and no touchdowns. This would mark the 4 straight game of the season without a touchdown, and 0 touchdowns on 21 catches for the third year wideout.
After the week 5 bye, Bryant would catch his first and second touchdowns of the season, while also setting his career high of 13 receptions in a crushing week 6 loss to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Baltimore Ravens. With 32 seconds remaining in the game, Dez caught a touchdown pass from Quarterback Tony Romo to bring the score to 31-29. Following a failed two-point conversion, Dallas would recover a crucial onside-kick to give the offense one last opportunity to win the game. After horrible clock management by the Dallas coaching staff, kicker Dan Bailey would attempt a 51-yard field goal, but would sail wide left to end the game 31-29.
Dez only had 2 catches for 14 yards in the week 7 win against the Carolina Panthers.
Throughout September and October, he was being criticized for dropping balls, fumbles or running poor routes, but he started to live up to his potential in a week 8 game against the New York Giants. Dez accumulated 110 yards on only 5 catches (22.0 YPC average), and almost came up with a last minute hail mary touchdown (it was reversed because his hand was ruled out of bounds).
Bryant only had one catch for 15 yards against the Atlanta Falcons on the November 14, 19-13 week 9 loss in the Georgia Dome. Although his one catch performance was far from the start of a breakout season, he bounced back in the week 10 win against division rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles to amass 87 yards on only 3 catches and one touchdown. This brings his weeks 9 and 10 performance to 102 yards on 4 receptions (25.5 YPC average) and one touchdown. That week 10 performance was the start of a break out season, that was worthy of Pro Bowl consideration.
In week 11 against the Cleveland Browns, Bryant had 12 catches for a then career-high 145 yards, breaking his previous personal best of 110 yards during week 8 against the New York Giants. His 12 receptions fell short of his career-high 13 catches during week 6 against the Baltimore Ravens.
Despite a week 12 loss against the Washington Redskins, Bryant matched his yardage total from the previous week while adding 2 touchdowns.
In weeks 13, 14 and 15 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Cincinnati Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers, Bryant compiled a total of 207 receiving yards on 14 receptions (14.8 YPC average), and 4 touchdown receptions. This brought his 6-week scoring total to 8 touchdowns, which helped the team win 5 out of their last 6 games.
Against the New Orleans Saints in a week 16 loss, he had the best game of his career up to that point, with nine receptions for a career-high 224 yards (fourth most in team history), two touchdowns and also tying the franchise record for most consecutive games (7) with at least a touchdown reception, which is shared with Franklin Clarke (1961–1962), Bob Hayes (1965–1966) and Terrell Owens (2007).
In the last game of the season, Bryant caught 4 balls thrown his way for 71 yards in the week 17 loss to rival and eventual division champions, the Washington Redskins. Since week 10 and the midway point of the 2012 season, Bryant accumulated 879 yards and 10 touchdowns on 50 receptions (17.6 YPC average and 5:1 touchdown ratio).
Bryant finished the 2012 season with 92 receptions for 1,382 yards (15 YPC average) and 12 touchdowns; these ranked 10th, 6th and 3rd respectively among all receivers.
He suffered from several injuries throughout the second half of the season. He injured his finger in early December, opting to play through the injury for the duration of the season, saying that opponents would "have to break my leg to keep me out." He left in the fourth quarter of the final game of the season against the Washington Redskins with a back injury. Head Coach Jason Garrett stated after the game that Dez "could barely walk," with the injury.
2013.
Dez Bryant's 2013 season started slow with just 4 receptions for 22 receiving yards in a week 1 victory over the New York Giants. 
Bryant rebounded with 9 receptions for 141 receiving yards and a touchdown in a Week 2 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. Though Dez had such an impact in the 17–16 loss to the Chiefs, he dropped a deep pass from Tony Romo that surely would have been a game changing touchdown.
Over the course of the next two weeks, Bryant had 10 receptions for 119 yards with three touchdowns, in a 31–7 win versus the St. Louis Rams and a 30–21 loss to the San Diego Chargers. 
In a Week 5 51–48 shootout with the Denver Broncos, Bryant had 6 receptions for 141 receiving yards and two touchdowns. Quarterback Tony Romo would break the Dallas Cowboys single game passing yards record with 506 yards, and throw for 5 touchdowns and one interception, as opposing quarterback Peyton Manning would throw for 414 yards and 4 touchdowns and one interception, giving Manning the first of his sensational season. Although both captains had a turnover each in this game, Romo would be highly criticized for the timing of his, as it happened at his own 24 yard line as he tripped over Pro Bowl left tackle Tyron Smith's foot with 2 minutes remaining in the game, and the score tied 48-48. Denver's sure-legged kicker, Matt Prater, would go on to kick game winning field goal as time expired. The total of 99 points between the two teams are tied for second most all-time since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. 
Dez could not get things going in the next week, finishing with 5 catches for 36 yards in a week 6 victory over NFC East rivals, the Washington Redskins. 
In a week 7 blowout win against Nick Foles and the Philadelphia Eagles, Bryant had 110 yards on 8 catches with no touchdowns. 
After a heartbreaking 31–30 loss to the Detroit Lions in week 8, Bryant would finish with 3 catches for 72 yards and two touchdowns, his 3rd multi-touchdown game of the season. Prior to the game, Dez said in an interview about Lions' receiver Calvin Johnson, "I believe I can do whatever he can do. I think it's just a pride thing. When it comes to football, just being on the field, it's a mindset and having a mentality. I honestly believe when I'm there, I'll be feeling like there's nothing I can't do. Whatever the coaches ask me to do, I'm going to do it." Many people around the league took this out of context as Dez was saying he was "better" than "Megatron" is. He then replied with this statement: “I think a lot of people took it the wrong way,” Bryant said. “I don’t compare myself with anybody. I think when you get to comparing yourself with others, that’s when you start to have a downfall.
“What I was saying was, I can make catches and all of that. Things he can do, I can do. I wasn’t saying it as it was just me who was able to do it. I’m pretty sure the next guy would say the same exact thing.”
Johnson would go on to have a career day, breaking the single game receiving yards record with 329 yards on 14 catches and one touchdown. 
Over the next 5 games against the Minnesota Vikings, New Orleans Saints, New York Giants, Oakland Raiders, and Chicago Bears, Dez compiled a total of 267 yards on 25 catches and only two touchdowns; averaging a mere 5 catches with 53.4 yards and 0.4 touchdowns per game.
In yet another heartbreaking week 15 loss to the Green Bay Packers without Aaron Rodgers, Dez finished with a season high 11 catches for 153 yards with one touchdown. Dallas would go on to lose the game by one point, 37–36, making it the third time this was done in the 2013 Season. TV cameras showed Bryant leaving the field with over a minute left in the game.
Bryant would finish the final two games of the season with 12 catches for 172 yards and two touchdowns against division rivals Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles. 
Dez finished the season with 93 catches and 13 touchdowns; both career highs, and 1,233 yards. These ranked 8th in catches, 13th in yards, and 3rd in touchdowns respectively among all receivers. Bryant would go on to his first Pro Bowl in 4 seasons.
Personal.
Bryant had a troubled upbringing, born to a teenage mother who was arrested for dealing crack cocaine when he was age eight. He went on to live in eight different homes while at Lufkin High School.
Bryant was sued in March 2011 for $861,350 for legal fees and the cost of jewelry he allegedly took without payment.
On July 16, 2012, Bryant was arrested on a class A misdemeanor domestic violence charge for allegedly striking his biological mother, Angela Bryant. She ultimately didn't press charges.
On April 4, 2013 Bryant signed his second major endorsement deal with the Jordan Brand. He made the announcement via his Twitter account.
In March 2013 Bryant spoke at an event for Dallas Men Against Abuse.
On November 14, 2013, Bryant walked into a Dallas Walmart shopping for the Play Station 4, and purchased his own as well as at least 6 other gamers' consoles for them.

Edirnekapı Martyr's Cemetery

The Edirnekapı Martyr's Cemetery () is a burial ground located in the neighborhood of Edirnekapı, in the European part of Istanbul, Turkey. It consists of an old, historical part and a modern one.
The cemetery is said originally to have been formed with the graves of the Ottoman soldiers, who fell in the battle during the Second Ottoman Siege and Fall of Constantinople in 1453, where the last Byzantine emperor Constantine XI established his command and the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II made his triumphal entry into the conquered city. There is however no historical or archaeological evidence for this, the oldest known graves date from ca. 1600 AD. The cemetery is situated outside Edirnekapı (literally: Adrianople Gate), historically the Gate of Charisius of the city walls, on top of the sixth hill of the old city.
The old part of the cemetery, including an area called "Mısır Tarlası" (literally: Corn Field), hosts graves of personalities from the 16th to the early 20th centuries. The other part of the cemetery consists of two grounds, Edirnekapı Cemetery and Sakızağacı Cemetery. Soldiers, who fought and were wounded in the Russo-Turkish Wars, Balkan Wars and the World War I, and died in Istanbul after hospitalization, were interred in Edirnekapı Cemetery. The General Command of Mapping denotes the number of such historical graves with around 13,000. 
Military personnel of the Turkish Army, Navy and Air Force, personnel of the police force, firefighters and Turkish Airlines have all separate departments in the cemetery.

Muhammad Ali Ja'abari

Sheikh Muhammad Ali Ja'abari ( 1900-1980) was the long-serving mayor of the Palestinian city of Hebron, appointed by Jordan, from 1948 to 1976. Ja'abari was head of the Jericho Conference in Jericho which supported the unification of the West Bank and Jordan. In the 1950s, he held a seat in the upper chamber of the Jordanian government.
After Israel occupied the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War, he proposed that Israel only remain in power for five years after which the Palestinians would reserve the right of self-determination. Apparently, it had been agreed with Israel that he would serve as the Prime Minister of a new Palestinian state. He prominently opposed the violent nature of the fedayeen. Throughout the 1970s, he was member of various Jordanian cabinets.
Ja'abari died in 1980. He is related to Sulaiman Ja'abari, the former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.

Arthur Cuming Ringland

Arthur Ringland (1882-1978) is best known as the principal founder of CARE. Ringland began his lifelong government career in 1900 when he joined the U.S. Forest Service where he helped establish the national park and national forest system. Between 1900 and 1945, Arthur Ringland led a variety of government programs that ranged from conservation work to refugee relief. In 1945 he originated the concept of the private voluntary organization that became CARE. A principal aspect of that work was persuading the government to provide ships to transport food packages that had been donated for the needy in Europe. He thus became known as "the father of CARE," and was honored for his efforts by the United Nations in 1958.
"He was born in New York, received his master’s degree in forestry at the Sheffield School of Science, Yale University. He entered Federal Forest work while still a student in 1900.
In 1905, the year the modern Forest Service was created as an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Mr. Ringland was assigned to the Southwest. As one of the first graduate foresters ever to work in the area, he was appointed Forest Assistant on the Lincoln National Forest. From 1908 to 1916 he was District Forester (Regional Forester) for the Southwestern Region. He led the survey crew that established the boundaries of the National Forests in the Region and a pioneer of fire planning. 
Mr. Ringland was present in the office of President Taft when the New Mexico statehood proclamation was signed in 1912.
In 1917, he joined the Army. He was assigned to a forestry regiment formed to run sawmills in France. After the war he stayed on to serve on the Board of War Damages for the American Peace Commission. Between 1919 and 1921 Mr. Ringland was chief of mission, under Herbert Hoover, for the American Relief Administration in EuropeHe directed the post war relief to Czechoslovakian children and from 1922 to 1924 was chief of mission to Turkey for relief of Russian refugees.

John Reeves (judge)

John Edward Reeves (born 2 January 1952) is an Australian politician, lawyer and judge. He was a Labor member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1983 to 1984, a prominent barrister in Darwin afterwards, the author of the controversial 1999 Reeves Report on Aboriginal land rights, and has been a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia since November 2007. 
From 2007 to 2012 (until the appointment of Duncan Kerr), he was the only former politician serving on the Federal Court, and the only former politician serving on an Australian appellate court.
Political career.
Reeves was born in Stanthorpe, Queensland, and was admitted as a solicitor in 1975 after completing five years articles of clerkship and the Queensland Solicitors Admission Course. He moved to Alice Springs, where he worked as a solicitor, and became involved with the Labor Party. He won preselection to contest the Northern Territory seat in the House of Representatives for the 1983 federal election, and was elected amidst the election of the Hawke government. Another federal election was held the following year, however, and Reeves was opposed in 1984 by the outgoing Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Paul Everingham. Initially thought to have little chance against the popular Everingham, he closed the gap in the polls significantly during the campaign, but fell approximately 1,800 votes short.
Reeves had moved to Darwin upon his election to parliament, and returned to his legal practice there after his 1984 defeat, being admitted to the bar the following year. He remained involved in the Labor Party, where he was heavily associated with the party's right-wing faction, and initially was a staunch ally of Opposition Leader Bob Collins. Reeves subsequently nominated and won the presidency of the Northern Territory branch of the ALP in 1985 over concerted opposition from the party's left wing. Though he remained ideologically aligned with Collins during his term as party president, Reeves announced in 1986 that he intended to run for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly at the 1987 territory election, in a move that was widely seen as a prelude to a leadership challenge against Collins. He lost preselection for the highly marginal CLP seat of Jingili, and was forced to contest the less marginal seat of Casuarina, which he went on to lose to incumbent MLA Nick Dondas.
Reeves' influence within the ALP began to wane significantly after 1987. A left-wing candidate, Warren Snowdon, won preselection for the federal seat for the 1987 federal election. Reeves strongly criticised Snowdon, stating that his victory was an "aberration" and urging the party not to shift to the left. Snowdon's supporters moved to gain control of the NT branch at the 1987 party conference, ousting both Reeves as party president and his ally Collins as delegate to the party's National Executive. Reeves attempted to make a political comeback at the 1990 territory election, but lost preselection for Casuarina and did not run for public office again.
Legal career and the Reeves Report.
Reeves developed a significant legal practice as a barrister in Darwin in the 1990s, and became increasingly distant from the Labor Party. In 1996, after his former rival Nick Dondas defeated Snowdon for the Northern Territory seat, he represented Dondas against a Court of Disputed Returns challenge by Snowdon. He was a close friend of Shane Stone, the CLP Chief Minister from 1995, and was appointed as a Queens Counsel by Stone in 1997.
In 1997, Liberal Prime Minister John Howard announced an inquiry into the "Aboriginal Land Rights Act". Reeves, known to be the CLP's preferred appointee, was tipped the head the inquiry, and was duly appointed in October 1997. The appointment was criticised by Aboriginal groups both for his lack of judicial experience and his history of defending developers accused of desecrating Aboriginal sacred sites. The Reeves Report was released in August 1998, and advocated sweeping changes to land rights legislation, including the scrapping of permits for access to Aboriginal land, granting the Northern Territory Government compulsory acquisition powers over Aboriginal land, and scrapping the Aboriginal land councils in favour of a new body. It notably did not, however, recommend the abolition of the right for Aboriginal communities to veto proposed mining projects on their land, a change that the mining industry had been heavily lobbying for.
The report was strongly opposed in Aboriginal communities across the territory at public hearings, with a copy of the report being publicly burned at Yuendumu and prominent Aboriginal leaders, including Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Alison Anderson, attacking the report in the media. It also received a lukewarm response in federal parliament, despite strong support from the Stone territory government; it was vigorously opposed by a number of prominent former Liberal politicians, including Malcolm Fraser, Ian Viner, Ian Wilson, Peter Baume, and Fred Chaney. A cross-party parliamentary committee in the House of Representatives unanimously declined to adopt the report's recommendations; it was also rejected by the corresponding committee in the Senate. None of its recommendations were enacted into law in the aftermath, but some were revived a decade later by the Howard government as part of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response.
Appointment as a Judge of the Federal Court.
Reeves remained a prominent figure in the Northern Territory legal community, serving as President of the Northern Territory Bar Association from 2000 to 2005 and Vice-President of the Australian Bar Association from 2003 to 2004. He also served as Deputy Chair of the Legal Practitioner's Complaints Committee, and as Chairman of the Northern Territory division of the Australian Red Cross. He was also appointed to the taskforce of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response in 2007.
Reeves was appointed to the Federal Court of Australia in November 2007, as one of the last judicial appointments of the Howard government. He was the first judge to be specifically based in Darwin, which had previously been served by interstate judges in an acting capacity. In March 2009, however, he was transferred to Brisbane, following concerns that the judicial workload in Darwin was not sufficient to warrant a resident judge, and a number of cases from which he had to withdraw due to potential conflicts of interest with his past legal work as a barrister.
Reeves is one of only six politicians to have served in both the Parliament of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia, alongside Nigel Bowen, Robert Ellicott, Merv Everett, Tony Whitlam and Duncan Kerr.
His notable decisions include (in no particular order); Stoddart v Boulton FCA 1108 regarding spousal privilege at common law in Australia and QGC Pty Limited v Bygrave [2011 FCA 1457 dealing with the role and registration of Indigenous Land Use Agreements. Reeves is currently the docket Judge for the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's litigation against the collapsed Storm Financial Ltd. The litigation also involves the Commonwealth Bank, Macquarie Bank and the Bank of Queensland. The case is due to be heard in the second half of 2012 and will involve Australia's most prominent barristers.
On 1 May 2009 Justice Reeves was appointed as an Additional Judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. Justice Reeves travels to both Darwin and Alice Springs in this capacity.

Auckland West

The former New Zealand parliamentary electorate on the western inner city of Auckland, was known as City of Auckland West from 1861 to 1890, and then Auckland West from 1905 to 1946.
Population centres.
From 1861 to 1884 the electorate comprised the suburbs of Ponsonby, Grey Lynn and Herne Bay. With the creation of the electorate for the , Auckland West was moved south to include Grey Lynn, Newton and Kingsland.
From 1890 to 1905, Auckland West - along with and - were merged into the multi-member electorate. In 1903 the Parliament passed the City Single Electorates Act, abolishing multi-member electorates from the end of the 15th Parliament in 1905.
The three inner-city Auckland electorates were recreated in 1905, with Auckland West first comprising the suburbs of Ponsonby, Herne Bay, Newton and parts of Grey Lynn; and from 1908 to 1946 covering Ponsonby and Herne Bay.
History.
The City of Auckland West electorate was created for the election held on 11 January 1861 and it lasted to 1890. During this period, City of Auckland West was a two-member electorate.
At the first election in 1861, Josiah Firth and John Williamson were elected. Firth resigned on 30 April 1862, and was succeeded by James Williamson (no relation to John Williamson) in the .
In the December 1875 election, Sir George Grey and Patrick Dignan were the only candidates in the two-member electorate and were thus declared elected. In January 1876, Grey also contested and won a seat in the Thames electorate. A protest against Grey's election was lodged with the returning officer the following day, stating that Grey had not been eligible to stand for election in Thames, as he had already been elected in Auckland West. This petition was filed to the House of Representatives at the end of January. On 8 July, the report of the committee inquiring into Sir George Grey's election for the Thames was read to the House. It was found that his election to the Thames electorate was in accordance with the law, but that he had to make a decision for which electorate he would sit. On 15 July 1876, Grey announced that he would represent Thames, and he moved that a by-election be held in Auckland West for the seat that he would vacate there.
The 25 July 1876 by-election caused by Grey's retirement was won by Benjamin Tonks, who resigned in 1877.
The electorate was then represented by James Wallis 1877-81, William John Hurst 1879-81 and David Goldie 1887-90.
The "Auckland West" electorate was created in 1905, and lasted to 1946. It was held for 1905-11 & 1914-19 by Charles Poole, 1911-14 by James Henry Bradney, and from 1919 until he died in 1940 by revered Labour prime minister Michael Joseph Savage. The next holder Peter Carr 1940-46 also died while holding the seat.

Raja Sakhi Daler Khan

General Raja Sakhi Daler Khan was born in the village of Sarsawa, Kotli. He led Pakistani troops and irregulars in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. Due to his major role in the liberation of the Poonch valley regions of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, the village of Sarsawa was subsequently renamed Sakhi Daler Abad in his honour.
Military career.
Raja Sakhi Daler Khan joined the Indian National Army within which he was promoted to the rank of General. He resigned from his post and joined the All-India Muslim League on June 6, 1946. League leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah requested that he file a report about the current situation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Khan visited the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Ram Chandra Kak and the last ruling Maharrajah, Maharaja Hari Singh, to better understand their views on whether Jammu and Kashmir should join with Pakistan as laid out in the British proposal for post-Independence India and Pakistan. He reported back to Jinnah at his residence at Aurang Zaib Road, Delhi in 1946 that an alternative plan was required to liberate Jammu and Kashmir. Khan tried to organise army veterans and recruit them for the fighting for Jammu and Kashmir by showing them a circular signed by Jinnah establishing a War Council on September 5, 1947. Following this, Khan led many battles against the Dogra forces that were currently in control of the area, particularly in Kotli District and Rajouri District.
Overthrow of the Dogra regime.
Under the leadership of Raja Sakhi Daler Khan the Muslims of Rajouri rose against the Dogra rulers and took Rajouri. Rajouri was subsequently subject to a heavy armed assault lasting several days by the Fiftieth Parachute Brigade, the Eightieth Brigade, and the 19th Indian Infantry Brigade supported by tanks of the Central Indian Horse. Rajouri fell under control of Indian forces on 12 April 1948, becoming part of the contested but Indian-occupied state of Jammu and Kashmir.

Battle of Vaikal

The Battle of Vaikal occurred in April 1465 in the valley of Vaikal, southeastern Albania. A new Ottoman sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid, Ballaban Badera (of Albanian origin), was sent by Sultan Mehmed II to inflict heavy losses on the Albanian forces. Skanderbeg had been prepared for the battle and prepared his troops for a plan of action. This worked well until some of Skanderbeg's officers did not follow orders to stop chasing the Ottoman forces and were captured along with their men. The officers were sent back to Constantinople where they were tortured and executed and their bodies were thrown to the dogs.
Background and prelude.
The Sultan Mehmed II gave Ballaban Badera, who was a sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid, the reins of the Ottoman campaigns in Albania. Ballaban had been a peasant in Skanderbeg's paternal domains who was raised through the devsirme to become a Janissary for the Sultan, much like Skanderbeg.
Ballaban was wary of his own defeat so he presented Skanderbeg with a series of gifts so that if the Ottoman commander was captured, the Albanian chieftain would have enough mercy to spare him. Ballaban had known Skanderbeg when they were both in the Ottoman court, but the former had always held great animosity towards the latter. Ballaban always tried to come off as Skanderbeg's personal friend and ally, but he was always ready for the moment to assault him. Once he learned that Skanderbeg had been camped in Vaikal with 4,500 men, Ballaban began his campaign to defeat Skanderbeg.
Battle-plan.
Skanderbeg had been waiting for an Ottoman assault and exhorted to his troops to constantly be prepared. The day before the battle, he explained the warriors' plan of action. He planned to trick the Ottomans into thinking that his forces were too weak and too frightened to fight. When the Ottomans were finally lured into both the valley and a false sense of security, the Albanian warriors would pounce on them. The Ottoman forces would then be chased all the way up to the hills and the Albanians would stop there to avoid a counterattack.
Battle.
The next day Ballaban came past the hills but, unexpectedly, charged at Skanderbeg's forces with great speed and fury. Skanderbeg allowed them to get near him and then he launched his own counterattack. A bloody battle soon followed with heavy casualties on both sides, but the Albanians managed to hold their ground and soon, the frightened Ottoman soldiers began to flee. As commanded, the Albanians pursued them up to the hills before many of the forces halted. The Albanians held the ground in the end, but it had come at a very great cost. Some of Skanderbeg's most trusted men were captured in this battle, including: Moisi Gjurica; Muzaka of Angelina; Gjin Muzaka; Gjon Perlati; Nikollë Berisha; Gjergj Kuka; Gjin Maneshi. These men were overcome by the heat of the battle and did not follow Skanderbeg's orders to stay below the hills and were captured by the reformed Ottoman forces. The Turks hid and ambushed the Albanian officers and their companions. The Turkish cavalry regained its confidence and they climbed on top of a high point where the infantry was stationed. Ballaban, however, was content with his soldiers' achievements and marched back to Constantinople with the captured captains.
Aftermath.
Skanderbeg send an ambassador to the Sultan to beg him to return his officers unharmed or else he would execute his own prisoners of war. The Sultan was not moved. He ordered a fifteen-day torture of the Albanian officers. Mehmed ordered Ballaban to continue his campaigns against Albania. Ballaban invaded Albania again, only to be soundly defeated.

ANTA Washington Square Theatre

The ANTA Washington Square Theatre was a theatre located on 40 West 4th St., in Greenwich Village, in New York City, and run by the American National Theater and Academy (ANTA). The theater was located away from the mainstream Broadway district, and was originally designed as a prototype for the Vivian Beaumont Theater. Demolished in 1968, it used a thrust stage tilted toward the audience, with the audience sitting on three sides of it. It did not employ the use of a curtain.
The theater, which was not intended to be permanent, had a seating capacity of 1,158 and was constructed for an estimated $525,000 on land lent by New York University. One observer praised "the fine acoustics that have been achieved by the creation of irregularly surfaced concave walls." However, that same observer noted that "the interior of the building is not striking and might well be mistaken for a small industrial plant of some sort."
Several highly regarded plays had their runs at the ANTA Washington Square. Among the most notable were the original productions of Arthur Miller's plays "After the Fall" and "Incident at Vichy", and the 1964 revival of Eugene O'Neill's "Marco Millions", starring Hal Holbrook as Marco Polo and David Wayne as Kublai Khan. A production relished by many Molière lovers was William Ball's 1964 staging of "Tartuffe", with an "outrageous" Michael O'Sullivan in the title role. Quite likely, the most famous show ever to play at the ANTA Washington Square was the smash hit musical "Man of La Mancha", which began its first New York run there on November 22, 1965 and transferred to the more conventional Martin Beck Theatre in 1968, pending the demolition of the Washington Square Theatre.

Joshua Whitsitt

Joshua Thomas Hoskins Whitsitt (1870 – 14 September 1943) was an Australian politician. Born in Ireland, where he was educated, he migrated to Tasmania as a youth, becoming a bank officer and farmer at Cooee. In 1909 he was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly as one of the members for Darwin, representing the Commonwealth Liberal Party. His erratic voting behaviour eventually led to his becoming an independent, successfully defending his seat in 1916 and 1919. In 1922, he transferred to federal politics, winning the federal seat of Darwin in the Australian House of Representatives for the Country Party, defeating sitting Nationalist member George Bell. He retired in 1925, returning to farming. Whitsitt died in 1943.

George David Challis (9 February 1891 – 15 July 1916) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the early 1910s.
Challis was a Tasmanian and started his career at Launceston, where he was a premiership player in 1909 and regular NTFA representative at the State Championships. He also represented Tasmania at the 1911 Adelaide Carnival, participating in their famous win over Western Australia. During this time he played mainly as a half forward or rover but when he was lured to Carlton in 1912 he soon established himself as a wingman. It was in that position that he starred in Carlton's 1915 premiership team. 
He almost missed out on the chance to win a premiership as he had attempted to join the army at the beginning of the season, only to be refused because his toes overlapped. A teacher by profession, he was eventually signed up and served with the 58th Infantry Battalion on the Western Front. Challis, by then a Sergeant, was killed in action when a heavy-calibre German artillery shell dropped into his trench in Armentières, France.

Curtis Fraser

Curtis Fraser (born April 4, 1982) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre who currently plays for KHL Medveščak of the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga.
Playing career.
Fraser played as a junior of the British Columbia Hockey League with the Victoria Salsa and the Vernon Vipers, before committed to a collegiate career with the University of Alaska Fairbanks of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association where he scored 114 points in 148 games over his four-year career. Undrafted, Curtis completed his senior year placed second to Kyle Greentree in scoring with 35 points, to leave the Nanooks ranked second in all-time games played. 
Fraser immediately made his professional debut following college to finish the 2006–07 season in the post-season with the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League. Curtis initially signed in the East Coast Hockey League with the Las Vegas Wranglers for the 2007–08 season and after 4 games with the Wranglers he was signed to a professional try-out contract with AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage on November 15, 2007. Tasked as a grinding role-player in the AHL, Fraser remained with the Rampage for the duration of the campaign, to post 6 points and 85 penalty minutes in 41 games, including a career best two-goal game against the Milwaukee Admirals on January 23, 2008. He was then returned to the Wranglers for the post season and scored 7 goals in 16 games on their run to the Kelly Cup finals. 
Fraser signed with the Peoria Rivermen for his third professional season in 2008–09. He played in a career high 65 games with the Riverman for 8 points and 90 penalty minutes. In game 4 of the first round playoff series against the Houston Aeros, Curtis had his hand injured by a slapshot from teammate Steve Wagner causing him to miss the Rivermen's last three playoff games and had surgery to insert pins into his broken right hand.
Unable to earn a one-way contract with the Rivermen for the 2009–10 season, Fraser was invited to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins training camp before suffering a dislocated shoulder in an exhibition game on September 19. He opted to then sign with the Rivermen's ECHL affiliate, the Alaska Aces, which marked a return from his college career days with the UAF. In an injury plagued year Fraser regained some offensive productivity with 13 points in a limited 17 games.
On September 20, 2010, Fraser returned to the Aces and was re-signed to a one-year contract. Invited on a try-out to attend the Lake Erie Monsters training camp for the 2010–11 season, Fraser made the Monsters opening season roster and made his AHL return in a 2-1 victory over the Syracuse Crunch on October 9, 2010. On February 17, 2011, he was released from his professional try-out with the Lake Erie Monsters.
Prior to the 2011–12 season, on June 28, 2011, Fraser signed a one-year contract with Italian club, SG Cortina.

<doc id="20129636" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20129636" title="Siyuan Programme">
Siyuan Programme

Siyuan Programme（simplified Chinese: 思源计划; traditional Chinese：思源計劃; pinyin: Sīyuán Jìhuà）is a training programme for excellent students at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. This programme is sponsored by Professional & Educational Services Ltd (PESI)[http://www.pesintl.com/about-us] and is carried out under the leadership of both Student Department of School Committee of Communist Party and School Committee of Youth League. With the idea of “ Receive help, Self-Help and then Help Others”, Siyuan is aimed at training excellent students to understand the essence of dedication, innovation and leadership. Every spring, Siyuan will recruit its new members from Tsinghua freshmen; those elected are out-standing students with different major backgrounds. Once admitted, these students will have the chance to be trained at social work, to perceive the situation of the country and to cultivate a global horizon.
It involves about 30 students a year.
Name.
The name of the programme, Siyuan, which means “to remember the wellhead”in Chinese, comes from the Chinese idiom “Never forget where one's happiness comes from”. This name is closely related to the concept and idea of this programme. (For more, please refer to the “Idea” part.)
Sponsor.
The initiator of Siyuan Programme is Doctor QIAN Bingyi, who is now the director of Professional Education Systems Institute (PESI), which is a Non-Profit organization of people united by Chinese-North in California, founded in 1988. The organization works for promoting the education and profession exchange between North America and Asia. Dr. Qian graduated from University of California, Berkeley and gets his PHD at University of California, San Francisco.
Another initiator is Mr. ZHU Weiren(Sandy Chau), who is both a successful entrepreneur in the IT industry and a kind Philanthropist. He is now a board member of Achievo Corporation in California, the USA and the president of Shin Shin Educational Foundation, US. He also graduated from UC Berkeley.
Tsinghua Entrepreneurs & Executive Club (TEEC) is an independent non-government organization founded by Tsinghua alumni, dedicated toward promoting innovation and start-ups in high-tech industries. When Mr. Zhu Weiren decided to set up the Siyuan Programme in Tsinghua, he wanted to match each student in this programme with a mentor. Some Tsinghua alumni who have carved out in IT industry came up with the idea to start up Tsinghua Entrepreneur Group (TEG), the predecessor of TEEC. There is a Siyuan Committee in TEEC to deal with the contact between entrepreneurs and students. TEEC has been supporting Siyuan Programme since it was set up in 2001.
Idea.
The idea of Siyuan can be interpreted as “Receive help, Self-Help and Help Others”. Actually, this idea was first put forward by the founders of TEEC. Narrowly speaking, “Receive help” means that Tsinghua students benefit from Tsinghua’s education ; “Self-Help” means that Tsinghua alumni help each other when they go to work and fight for their cause; “Help Others” means that successful alumni give their hands to students with their experience. But in a general sense, Siyuaners prefer the following explanation. “Be Helped” means “be helped by anyone when they need help especially when they are at school”, “Self-Help” means “help each other who are related to Siyuan Programme especially students themselves”, “Help Others” means “help those who need help most according to one’s capability”. The “cycle” lays stress on social responsibility and the spirit of service.
Training Programme.
Every student selected by the programme will be trained according to the training plan. The current version of the plan contains two main aspects: summer practice and training during the semesters. 
The summer practice will last throughout the whole four years of these undergraduates. They take part in three practice programme during three summer holidays respectively. The themes of the three practice programme are “Rural and China”, “Economics and China” and “Globe and China”. During “Rural and China”, which is in the first summer, students go to underdeveloped areas in China. They support the education there as tutors and investigate the poverty and problems of development. “Economics and China” requires students to go to the developed areas in China, such as the Yangtze River Delta, to realize the fast development after the Reforming and Opening-up Policy was carried out in 1978. In the third year, with the programme “Globe and China”, students go to Hong Kong to broad their horizons and understand the globalization of China today.
During the three years at school, there are also three themes: “Team Work”, “Volunteerism and Organizing Skills” and “Leadership Training”. Students will take part in orientation, a course called “Introduction to the Social Service of College Students”, youth forums, etc.
Organization.
Every spring, Siyuan will select excellent freshmen from all departments at Tsinghua University. After the writing test and interview, the list of new Siyuaners will be open to the public. Students graduated in different years are named after ordinal numbers. The first Siyuaners are the 2001 ones, who are called Siyuan 1st, so the most recent ones are called Siyuan 7th. There will be one or two support tutors assigned to the new Siyuaners every year.
Siyuan is organized under the leadership of Organization Department of School Committee of Youth League. In the year 2008, Siyuan formed a complete organization called Siyuan Group. There are 5 subgroups in charge of Contact & Investigation, Propaganda & Planning, Inner Quality Expanding, Networks & Websites, Internal Liaison and Recruiting separately. The Siyuaners manage themselves in this organization and facilitate the development of the programme.
The mission of Contact & Investigation Group is to do some researches on the influence the programme itself has on Siyuaners, i.e. whether they have understood the idea of “Be Helped, Self-Help and Help Others”. Besides, they have to update the contact information so that Siyuaners can keep in touch with each other even when they graduate from school.
Planning & Promotion Group takes charge of the propaganda work. They edit stuff to bring this programme known to outsiders. The materials will also be useful when the website is being set up. Sponsors, teachers and assistants are all glad to keep up with what Siyuaners are doing now. So Propaganda & Planning Group plays really an important role.
Inner Quality Expanding Group searches for information of lectures, exhibitions and performances. Then they organize Siyuaners in different grades to attend these activities, which not only edifies their minds but also facilitates communications. 
Networks & Websites Group is in charge of Siyuan’s own website. The website hasn’t been set up until Nov, 2008.
Internal Liaison Group organizes literature and sport activities regularly to build up relations between Siyuaners, which include some favorite and popular ones, such as football games and Kara OK.
Recruiting Group recruits new members for the programme. Every spring, they filter resumes, design examinations, help to interview students and finally help to decide who will be selected as new members.

Sioux Quartzite

The Sioux Quartzite is a Proterozoic quartzite that is found in region around the intersection of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa, and correlates with other rock units throughout the upper midwestern and southwestern United States. It was formed by braided river deposits, and its correlative units are thought to possibly define a large sedimentary wedge that once covered the passive margin on the then-southern side of the North American craton. In human history, it provided the catlinite, or pipestone, that was used by the Plains Indians to carve ceremonial pipes. With the arrival of Europeans, it was heavily quarried for building stone, and was used in many prominent structures in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and shipped to construction sites around the Midwest.
Geology.
The Sioux Quartzite is a red to pink Proterozoic quartzite. It is a thick stratigraphic unit (~3000 m) that crops out in southwestern Minnesota, southeastern and south-central South Dakota, northwestern Iowa, and a small part of northeastern Nebraska. It is correlated with other sandstone and quartzite units across Wisconsin (at Rib Mountain, Baraboo, Barron, Waterloo, and Flambeau), southeastern Iowa, southern Nebraska, and north-central New Mexico and southeast-central Arizona (Ortega, Mazatzal, and Deadman Quartzite).
Its age is constrained to be between 2280 ± 110 Ma from the uranium-lead dating of a rhyolite that underlies it in northwestern Iowa, and 1120 Ma from a potassium-argon date of deformation of the Sioux Quartzite in Pipestone, Minnesota. Its age can be better-constrained by extrapolation correlative units to between 1760 ± 10 Ma. and 1640 ± 40 Ma This period in which The Sioux Quartzite and its correlative units were deposited is known as the Baraboo interval, in which high relative sea levels covered a large amount of North America.
The Sioux quartzite was primarily formed by braided river deposits, of quartz arenite composition, with 95% of the rock being composed of rounded, fine to medium (0.125–0.5 mm) sand-size quartz grains. The rivers are believed to flow southeast, at a relatively shallow gradient. Its basal conglomerate is thought to be braided stream deposits that are more proximal to the source, and there is possible marine influence on the upper part of the unit – this interpretation is supported by evidence of marine sediments (shales and banded iron formations) atop its correlative unit in Baraboo, Wisconsin. In addition, the unit contains ~1 meter beds of claystone, which are known as Catlinite or Pipestone, because these beds were used by the natives of the area to carve pipe bowls. It is thought that the Sioux Quartzite and its correlative units are parts of a once-laterally-extensive sedimentary wedge that covered the then-southern passive margin of the North American craton.
The Sioux Quartzite is extremely resistant to erosion, and has formed a topographic high through most of Phanerozoic time. It was inundated by Phanerozoic seas during the periods of maximum sea level, and subsequent erosion removed these sedimentary units. For this reason, the only geologic units to sit atop the Sioux Quartzite are of Cretaceous age, deposited when a large portion of North America was covered by the Cretaceous Interior Seaway.
Many present-day outcrops of Sioux Quartzite were exposed by glacial erosion during the Quaternary. Some of these have been dated with the cosmogenic radionuclides beryllium-10 and aluminum-26 to determine how long ago the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated from the Upper Midwest. These dates show that southwestern Minnesota was last covered in glacial ice at least 500,000 years ago.
Use in buildings.
Several mansions and other notable buildings have been built using Sioux Quartzite. These include:
Perhaps the most unusual construction involved Sioux quartzite and petrified wood. The Pettigrew home and museum

Ștefan Procopiu

Ștefan Procopiu (; January 19, 1890 – August 22, 1972) was a Romanian physicist.
Biography.
Procopiu was born in 1890 in Bârlad, Romania. His father, Emanoil Procopiu, was employed at the Bârlad courthouse. His mother, Ecaterina Tașcă was the daughter of Gheorghe I. Tașcă (see Tașcă family). He attended the Gheorghe Roșca Codreanu High School in Bârlad from 1901 to 1908, continuing his studies at the Faculty of Sciences of the "Alexandru Ioan" Cuza University of Iași from 1908 to 1912. After graduation he became assistant to professor Dragomir Hurmuzescu.
In 1919 he obtained a scholarship to continue his studies in Paris, attending courses of famous scientists, such as Gabriel Lippmann, Marie Curie, Paul Langevin, Aimé Cotton. On 5 March 1924, Procopiu obtained the title of doctor in physics with the thesis "On the electric birefringence of suspensions" presented to a commission including professor Aimé Cotton as coordinator and Charles Fabry and Henri Mouton as cross-examiners.
After his return to Romania on January 15, 1925 professor of the gravitation, heat and electricity department of the "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University of Iași, replacing his former teacher Dragomir Hurmuzescu, who had retired., Procopiu coordinated the department until his retirement in 1962. At the same time he was appointed professor at the "Gheorghe Asachi" Polytechnic Institute of Iași
In 1939 Ștefan Procopiu published his treatise on "Electricity and Magnetism", followed in 1948 by his monography on “Thermodynamics”.
On June, 1948 he was appointed corresponding member of the Romanian Academy, being promoted to full membership on July 2, 1955. In 1964 he was awarded the Romanian State Prize. He was also decorated with the Order of Work (Ordinul Muncii), Order of the Star of Romania and the Order of Scientific Merit.
Procopiu was also selected twice as member in the Commission for the award of the Nobel Prize.
Procopiu was also deeply involved in the cultural life of the city of Iași. He was an active member of the Board of Directors of the National Theatre “Vasile Alecsandri” of Iași.
Ștefan Procopiu died on August 22, 1972 in Iași, Romania, at the age of 82.
Scientific activity.
Ștefan Procopiu started scientific research even before graduating. He continued this activity while he was assistant professor.
The magnetic moment of the electron.
The first important paper by Ștefan Procopiu is "Determining the Molecular Magnetic Moment by M. Planck’s Quantum Theory". After studying Planck’s quantum theory and Langevin’s magnetism theory, established the magnetic moment of the electron and determined the physical constant of magnetic moment, named magneton. Ștefan Procopiu published his results two years before Niels Bohr made the same discovery independently.
Continuing his studies, in 1954 he established a method for the experimental determination of the magneton, which he improved in 1963.
Other research before and during World War I.
Ștefan Procopiu also worked on wireless communications and in 1913 published a paper on “Experimental Research on Wireless Telegraphy”. In 1916 he invented a device for locating and establishing the depth of bullets in the bodies of the wounded soldiers.
Longitudinal depolarization of light.
In 1921, Procopiu discovered and analyzed in the Physics Laboratory of Sorbonne University a new optical phenomenon which consisted in the longitudinal depolarization of light by suspensions and colloids. In 1930, the occurrence was designated as "Procopiu Phenomenon" by prof. Augustin Boutaric. Part of this research was included in Procopiu's doctoral thesis.
Electromotive force of galvanic elements.
Thus, in 1930, studying the Barkhausen effect, Ștefan Procopiu discovered a circular effect of magnetic discontinuity. In 1951, this effect was named "Procopiu Effect". This discovery had important applications in the development of the memory of computers.
Studies of the Earth's magnetic field.
Earth’s magnetism was a continuous concern of Ștefan Procopiu, For 25 years he studied this phenomenon in Romania and developed the magnetic maps of the country. He also identified the magnetic anomaly located on the Iași-Botoșani line.
In 1947, Procopiu identified a variation of the Earth's magnetic field, with a periodicity of approximately 500 years, indicating that, starting 1932 Earth's magnetic moment increases from the equator to the poles.

David Storrer (24 November 1854 – 13 November 1935) was an Australian politician. 
Born in Freshwater Point, Tasmania, he was educated at Chalmers Church Grammar School before becoming a cabinet maker and furniture warehouseman. He served three separate terms as an alderman at Launceston from 1894 to 1897, 1898 to 1904 and 1913 to 1921, and was elected Mayor for 1903. 
In 1902, he was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly as a Protectionist, but the following year he resigned to contest the Australian House of Representatives seat of Bass in the 1903 federal election. He defeated sitting Free Trade MP William Hartnoll, becoming the second Protectionist from Tasmania in the House (the other was Philip Fysh, who was a Free Trader by inclination). In 1909, when the Protectionist and Free Trade Parties merged to form the Commonwealth Liberal Party, Storrer (along with fellow Protectionists William Lyne, George Wise and John Chanter) refused to support the fusion, and sat as an independent. He contested the seat in the 1910 election, but was defeated by the Labor candidate, Jens Jensen. Storrer died in 1935.

Edward Quillinan

Edward Quillinan (12 August 1791 - 8 July 1851) was an English poet who was a son-in-law and defender of William Wordsworth and a translator of Portuguese poetry.
Early life.
He was born at Oporto, Portugal, on 12 Aug. 1791, the son of Edward Quillinan, an Irishman of a good but impoverished family, who had become a prosperous wine merchant at Oporto. His mother, whose maiden name was Ryan, died soon after her son had been sent, in 1798, to England, to be educated at Roman Catholic schools. Returning to Portugal, he entered his father's counting-house, but this distasteful employment ceased upon the French invasion under Jean-Andoche Junot in 1807, which obliged the family to seek refuge in England.
Military service and early works.
After spending some time without any occupation, he entered the army as a cornet in a cavalry regiment, from which, after seeing some service at Walcheren, he passed into another regiment, stationed at Canterbury. A satirical pamphlet in verse, "The Ball Room Votaries", involved him in a series of duels, and compelled him to exchange into the 3rd Dragoon Guards, with which he served through the latter portion of the Peninsular war. In 1814 he made his first serious essay in poetry by publishing "Dunluce Castle, a Poem", which he followed with "Stanzas by the author of Dunluce Castle" (1814), and "The Sacrifice of Isabel" (a more important effort in 1816), and "Elegiac Verses" addressed to Lady Brydges in memory of her son, Grey Matthew Brydges (1817).
In 1817 he married Jemima, second daughter of Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges and subsequently served with his regiment in Ireland. In 1819 "Dunluce Castle" attracted the notice of Thomas Hamilton the original "Morgan O'Doherty" of "Blackwood's Magazine", who ridiculed it in a review entitled "Poems by a Heavy Dragoon". Quillinan deferred his rejoinder until 1821, when he attacked John Wilson and John Gibson Lockhart, whom he erroneously supposed to be the writers, in his "Retort Courteous", a satire largely consisting of passages from "Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk", done into verse. The misunderstanding was dissipated through the friendly offices of Robert Pearse Gillies, and all parties became good friends.
Later career.
In 1821 Quillinan retired from the army, and settled at Spring Cottage, between Rydal and Ambleside, and thus in the immediate neighbourhood of Wordsworth, whose poetry he had long devotedly admired. Scarcely was he established there when a tragic fate overtook his wife, who died from the effects of burns, 25 May 1822, leaving two daughters. Wordsworth was godfather of the younger daughter, and he wrote an epitaph on Mrs. Quillinan. Distracted with grief, Quillinan fled to the continent, and afterwards lived alternately in London, Paris, Portugal, and Canterbury, until 1841, when he married Wordsworth's daughter, Dora Wordsworth. The union encountered strong opposition on Wordsworth's part, not from dislike of Quillinan, but from dread of losing his daughter's society. He eventually submitted with a good grace, and became fully reconciled to Quillinan, who proved an excellent husband and son-in-law. In 1841 Quillinan published "The Conspirators", a three-volume novel, embodying his recollections of military service in Spain and Portugal. In 1843 he appeared in "Blackwood" as the defender of Wordsworth against Walter Savage Landor, who had attacked his poetry in an imaginary conversation with Richard Porson, published in the magazine. Quillinan's reply was a cento of all the harsh pronouncements of the erratic critic respecting great poets, and the effect was to invalidate as a whole criticisms that might have been defensible individually. Landor dismissed his remarks as "Quill-inanities;" Wordsworth himself is said to have regarded the defence as indiscreet.
In 1845 the delicate health of his wife induced Quillinan to travel with her for a year in Portugal and Spain, and the excursion produced a charming book from her pen. In 1846 he contributed an extremely valuable article to the "Quarterly Review" on Gil Vicente, the Portuguese dramatic poet. In 1847 Dora died, and four years later (8 July 1851) Quillinan himself died (at Loughrig Holme, Ambleside) of inflammation, occasioned by taking cold upon a fishing excursion; he was buried in Grasmere churchyard. His latter years had been chiefly employed in translations of Luís de Camões' "Lusiad", five books of which were completed, and of Alexandre Herculano's "History of Portugal". The latter, also left imperfect, was never printed; the "Lusiad" was published in 1853 by John Adamson, another translator of Camoen's. A selection from Quillinan's original poems, principally lyrical, with a memoir, was published in the same year by William Johnston, the editor of Wordsworth.
Assessment.
Quillinan was a sensitive, irritable, but most estimable man. "All who know him," says Southey, writing in 1830, "are very much attached to him." "Nowhere," says Johnston, speaking of his correspondence during his wife's hopeless illness, "has the writer of this memoir ever seen letters more distinctly marked by manly sense, combined with almost feminine tenderness." Matthew Arnold in his "Stanzas in Memory of Edward Quillinan", speaks of him as "a man unspoil'd, sweet, generous, and humane." As an original poet his claims are of the slenderest; his poems would hardly have been preserved but for the regard due to his personal character and his relationship to Wordsworth. His version of the "Lusiad", nevertheless, though wanting his final corrections, has considerable merit, and he might have rendered important service to two countries if he had devoted his life to the translation and illustration of Portuguese literature.

Werner Krieglstein

Werner Josef Krieglstein, Ph.D. (October 31, 1941), a Fulbright Scholar and University of Chicago fellow, is an award winning and internationally recognized scholar, director and actor. Krieglstein is the founder of a neo-Nietzschean philosophical school called Transcendental Perspectivism. Krieglstein's "philosophy of compassion" has been the subject of symposium lectures at many prominent conferences including the UNESCO section of the World Congress of Philosophy conference in Seoul Korea (August, 2008), the ISAIL "Fields of Conflict-Fields of Wisdom": 4th International Congress in Wuerzburg, Germany (May, 2008), the meeting of the American Philosophical Association in Washington D.C. (Symposium Chair: Sept. 2006), and the ISUD Fourth World Conference of the International Society for Universal Dialogue (Summer, 2001), among many others.
Career.
Academic background.
Krieglstein was born in 1941 at Blatnice, (near Plzeň), at the time an annexed part of Nazi Germany's Sudetenland (now known as Blatnice, Czech Republic). Following the post-war Expulsion of the Germans from Czechoslovakia, he relocated near Frankfurt, Germany. In the Sixties, Krieglstein was a student at the Frankfurt School in Germany with Theodor W. Adorno. In his first book, Krieglstein credits the roots of his passion for the transformative aspects of philosophy to the tutelage of Adorno. As a German Jew, Adorno returned to Germany almost immediately after WWII ended with the goal of challenging the indoctrination many university students had received in Hitler's youth education programs. Before moving to the United States, Krieglstein also studied at the Free University of Berlin. Following his studies in Germany, Krieglstein pursued his doctorate at the University of Chicago as a Fulbright Scholar and University Fellow.
Krieglstein has held teaching positions at the University of Helsinki, Finland, and Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo. He currently is professor emeritus of philosophy and religious studies at the College of DuPage, where he was awarded the Most Outstanding Teacher Award in 2003 and the Distinguished Regional Humanities Educator Award from the Community College Humanities Association in 2008. In addition to his role as professor, Krieglstein is a course director at the Interuniversity Center in Dubrovnik, Croatia, and a board member of the International Society for Universal Dialogue. His philosophy of compassion is also finding an audience within the education reform movement, with symposium lectures at AEPL "Reclaiming the Wisdom Tradition for Education" conference in Northern California (May, 2008), the NISOD International Conference on Teaching and Leadership Excellence in Austin, TX (May, 2007), and the CCHA Creating Communities Conference hosted by the University of Chicago (Nov, 2006).
Actor and director.
While at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Krieglstein rose to prominence in theater when he was appointed as director of the avant-garde theater, Die Neue Bühne, at the Goethe University. While writing for the theater's paper, he interviewed members of The Living Theater including Jerzy Grotowski, and was fortunate enough to study mime under Marceau student Jeanne Winkler. An ISAIL bio notes that "his black light production of Kafka's "The Metamorphosis" was performed over two hundred times at both European and American festivals." After emigrating to the US and while teaching at Western Michigan University in 1976, he founded and directed a small rural theater company in Lawrence, Michigan known as the Whole Arts Theater, which later moved to Kalamazoo. Michigan's official tourism site describing Krieglstein's founding of the Whole Art Theater More recently, Krieglstein has shifted his acting focus to film. In the past few years, he has worked on several independent films including 'Urban Ground Squirrels' by Wiggle Puppy Productions, Chicago (Mark Krieglstein, 2002) and the internationally known 'Light Denied' by Delos Films, Warsaw (Paweł Kuczyński, 2008), along with a few smaller films.
Personal life.
Krieglstein is married to Maryann Krieglstein, a professor at COD. After attaining his PhD, the two lived in a few places around the world including Finland and Morocco before settling down on an organic farm in Lawrence, Michigan. While farming, he continued to teach and pursue acting in nearby Kalamazoo. In 1990, Krieglstein moved with his family to Glen Ellyn, Illinois, home to the College of DuPage where he would begin his almost 20 year professorship. Together, Maryann and Werner have five sons and one grandson: Robin (07/01/71), married to Suruchi have a son named Milan (03/14/09); Mark (02/25/75); Daniel (03/31/79), married to Andrea Trocchio; Thomas (12/05/80), married to Annie Colbert; and Michael (09/02/84).
Philosophy.
Transcendental Perspectivism is a hybrid philosophy blending Friedrich Nietzsche's Perspectivism and the utopian ideals of the Transcendentalism movement. Transcendental Perspectivism challenges Nietzsche's claim that there is no absolute truths while fully accepting his observation that all truth can only be known in the context of ones perception. This is accomplished through an appreciation of the emotional relationship between two perceptions (the "perceiver" and the "other"). In the simplest of terms, a transcendental truth can only be known when two individuals come to agree on the truth by either force or cooperation, thus working together to build a shared reality.
