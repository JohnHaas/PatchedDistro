Yakovlev Yak-20

The Yakovlev Yak-20 (in Russian Як-20), was an experimental piston-engined trainer developed in the USSR in 1949. It did not go into production. 
Design and development.
In 1949 the Yak-20 was designed by the OKB for use with aviation clubs as a trainer and sport aircraft. Intended to be the cheapest modern aircraft that could serve as a useful pilot trainer and aerobatic sport aircraft, the Yak-20 was intended to be considerably cheaper to build and operate than the contemporary Yak-18. 
Though structurally similar to the Yak-18, the Yak-20 had a welded steel tube fuselage which was skinned with aluminium alloy sheet and fabric, with Aluminium alloy wings, skinned in metal back to the single spar, and fabric aft of the spar. Accommodation was side by side under a large blown canopy, which slid open to the rear. The cockpit had dual stick controls, with the pilot sitting to port. There was a central push-pull throttle, and simple gyro instruments. The engine was the newly developed Ivchenko AI-10 five cylinder radial. This engine was small, and extremely light. It was rated at 80hp, driving a V-515 controllable-pitch counterweight propeller. Fuel was carried in two 35 liter (7.7 gallon) tanks in the wing roots, ahead of the single spar. 
Testing.
The Yak-20 was designed from the start to be fully aerobatic with very high spin resistance. The two prototypes were tested by pilots Anokhin and Georgii Shiyanov, and later by DOSAAF pilots, as well as a succession of leading aerobatic sport pilots who were invited to fly it. All were eager to see it put into production. State Acceptance trials followed, but the State evaluation team considered the Yak-20 too small and under-powered, recommending a redesign to match the performance of the Yak-18. Some of the criticisms of the State evaluation team were addressed in the second prototype, (Yak-20-2), which, as a result, became heavier and lost the performance edge of the first prototype. With Yak-18 production already in full swing, production of the Yak-20 was deemed superfluous. The final blow came when production of the small Ivchenko AI-10 engine was cancelled.

First round.
Sweden vs. Israel.
Controversy.
Sweden attracted controversy when they forbade fans from seeing the matches inside the Baltic Hall, fearing anti-Israeli violence. Several Swedish politicians, including the mayor of Malmo and the head of the Green Party, said that they wanted to cancel the match instead of having an Israeli team play in the city. A proposal to move the matches to Stockholm fell through because of limited preparation time. Israeli player Andy Ram condemned the switch, calling it a "stupid decision". In the end, anti-Israel protesters rioted outside the stadium while the Swedish team was stunned when Israel defeated them.
The Davis Cup fined the Swedish tennis federation $25,000 and ordered them to pay an additional $15,000 in what would have been gate receipts. The city of Malmö was also banned from hosting Davis Cup matches for the next five years, and Sweden will lose its choice of venue if it happens again, being required to guarantee that future matches will be open to the public.

The Three Apples

The Three Apples (Arabic:التفاحات الثلاثة)is a story contained in the One Thousand and One Nights collection (also known as the "Arabian Nights").
It is a first level story, being told by Scheherazade herself, and contains one second level story, the Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son. It occurs early in the Arabian Nights narrative, being started during night 19, after the Tale of Portress. The Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son starts during night 20, and the cycle ends during night 25, when Scheherazade starts the Tale of the Hunchback.
Plot summary.
In this tale, a fisherman discovers a heavy locked chest along the Tigris river and he sells it to the Abbasid Caliph, Harun al-Rashid, who then has the chest broken open only to find inside it the dead body of a young woman who was cut into pieces. Harun orders his vizier, Ja'far ibn Yahya, to solve the crime and find the murderer within three days or else he will have him executed instead. Ja'far, however, fails to find the culprit before the deadline. Just when Harun is about to have Ja'far executed for his failure, a plot twist occurs when two men appear, one a handsome young man and the other an old man, both claiming to be the murderer. Both men argue and call each other liars as each attempts to claim responsibility for the murder. This continues until the young man proves that he is the murderer by accurately describing the chest in which the young woman was found.
The young man reveals that he was her husband and the old man her father, who was attempting to save his son-in-law by taking the blame. Harun then demands to know his motives for murdering his wife, and the young man then narrates his reasons as a flashback of events preceding Harun's discovery of the locked chest. He eulogizes her as a faultless wife and mother of his three children, and describes how she one day requested a rare apple when she was ill. He then describes his two-week long journey to Basra, where he finds three such apples at the Caliph's orchard. On his return to Baghdad, he finds out that she would no longer eat the apples because of her lingering illness. When he returns to work at his shop, he discovered a slave passing by with the same apple. He asked him about it and the slave replied that he received it from his girlfriend, who had three such apples that her husband found for her after a half-month journey. The young man then suspected his wife of unfaithfulness, rushed home, and demanded to know how many apples remained there. After finding one of the apples missing, he drew a knife and killed her. He then describes how he attempted to get rid of the evidence by cutting her body to pieces, wrapping it in multiple layers of shawls and carpets, hiding her body in a locked chest, and abandoning it in the Tigris river. Yet another twist occurs after he returns home and his son confesses to him that he had stolen one of the apples, and a slave had taken it and run off with it. The boy also confesses that he told the slave about his father's quest for the three apples. Out of guilt, the young man concludes his story by requesting Harun to execute him for his unjust murder. Harun, however, refuses to punish the young man out of sympathy, but instead sets Ja'far a new assignment: to find the tricky slave who caused the tragedy within three days, or be executed for his failure.
Ja'far yet again fails to find the culprit before the deadline has passed. On the day of the deadline, he is summoned to be executed for his failure. As he bids farewell to all his family members, he hugs his beloved youngest daughter last. It is then, by complete accident, that he discovers a round object in her pocket which she reveals to be an apple with the name of the Caliph written on it. In the story's twist ending, the girl reveals that she brought it from their slave, Rayhan. Ja'far thus realizes that his own slave was the culprit all along. He then finds Rayhan and solves the case as a result. Ja'far, however, pleads to Harun to forgive his slave and, in exchange, narrates to him the "Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and His Son Badr al-Dín Hasan".
Analysis.
The story has been described as a "whodunit" murder mystery with multiple plot twists. However, although the story has detective fiction elements, it lacks a detective, in that the person charged with investigating the murder, Ja'far, does nothing to solve the crime, but in both cases sits at home awaiting his fate. Both times he is saved from execution by a chance revelation.

FK VEF Rīga

VEF Rīga (later known as DAG Rīga) was a football club in Latvia, one of the strongest teams in the Latvian league between 1945 and 1994.
Team history.
A football club connected to the VEF plant was founded in the mid 1930s, in 1939 it first won promotion to the top Latvian league by beating Ventspils Stars 6:2 in the playoff final. VEF was the only Latvian football club to keep its name through the 1940s - it played in the Latvian league under German occupation and it remained where after the second Russian occupation. The Soviet era was the best for the club: VEF won six Latvian titles between 1970 and 1983, it was also a 3 time winner of the Latvian Football Cup. The first half of the 1970s was the best period in the club's history when it won five of its titles, one cup and also reached the cup final three times]. In that period VEF was managed by former FK Daugava Rīga star player Georgijs Smirnovs. Another retired Daugava forward, Nikolajs Jermakovs, played in the team's attack.
When Latvia regained independence and the VEF plant was rapidly losing its former glory, the football team was also affected. However, it managed to finish 3rd in the first season of Virslīga. After the 1992 Virslīga season the club was renamed VEF-Zenta Rīga, the name of the club's new sponsor. In 1994 it played as DAG Rīga and finished third for the second time. The former VEF team ceased to exist in Riga in 1995 with the merger of DAG with Olimpija Liepāja under the name DAG Liepāja. However through the merger with Liepāja VEF Rīga can be considered a predecessor to one of the strongest football clubs in Latvia - Liepājas Metalurgs.

Low Energy Antiproton Ring

The Low Energy Anti-Proton Ring (LEAR) was an experiment at CERN designed to decelerate and store antiprotons, to study the properties of antimatter and to create atoms of antihydrogen. The experiment was constructed in 1982 and operated until 1996, when it was converted into the Low Energy Ion Ring, which will be used in the lead ion injection process for the Large Hadron Collider. Antiprotons for the ring was created by the CERN Proton Synchrotron via the Antiproton Collector and the Antiproton Accumulator. The creation of at least 9 atoms of antihydrogen were confirmed by the PS210 experiment in 1995.
Low energy antiproton research continues at CERN using the Antiproton Decelerator. It was built as a successor for LEAR and started operation in 2000.

Charles H. Brandes is one of the more closely followed value investors working today, and is a disciple of the Benjamin Graham school of value investing. Brandes Investment Partners, which was started in 1974, currently has over $28.9 billion under management (down from over $111 billion in 2007) and is based in San Diego, California. In the Forbes 400 Richest Americans publication for 2007, Brandes ranked 165. He has been a CFA charterholder for more than 25 years. Brandes met Ben Graham in San Diego while he was training to be a stockbroker. He was able to learn firsthand the techniques Graham used to determine undervalued investment securities.
Early life and education.
Brandes grew up in Pittsburgh. In 1965, he graduated from Bucknell University with a bachelors degree in economics. He did graduate studies at San Diego State University.
Career.
As of 2007, Brandes' U.S. Value Equity fund has beaten the S&P 500 index for the past five, 10 and 15 years. According to the book "Investment Leadership", Brandes' Global equity fund had an average return of 19.21% over the prior 20 years. Brandes Investments strictly follows Graham and Dodd principles as outlined in the books "Security Analysis" and "The Intelligent Investor". Also recently, the firm made investments in the troubled mortgage and financial sectors, paying bargain prices for investments in Countrywide Financial, Washington Mutual, Wachovia Corp. and Bank of America. Brandes is among the largest institutional shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland and General Motors. Thomson Financial's well-regarded Nelson's World's Best Money Managers rankings consistently lists Brandes Investment Partners among the Top 10 International Equity Fund Managers in the world.
Brandes' adherence to Graham and Dodd principles has extended to investment research. He commissioned a study to investigate the "Falling Knives" strategy, the investment axiom that catching falling knives (a stock whose price has been dropping precipetously) is like catching falling money (likely to lead to losses). Researching 1,000 companies between 1986 and 2002 whose price had fallen 60% over a twelve-month period, the study found that within three years of the decline 13% of the companies went bankrupt, but despite this that the portfolio as a whole gained in value by 18% over three years. Brandes published a well received book on his investment strategies in 2003 titled "Value Investing Today" (McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0-07-141738-9).
Philanthropy.
The Tanya and Charles Brandes Foundation funded a scholarship program at San Diego Jewish Academy's Maimonides Upper School.

Saâne

The Saâne is a river of Normandy, France, in length, flowing through the department of Seine-Maritime.
Geography.
The Saâne has its source in the Pays de Caux in the territory of the hamlet of Varvannes, in the commune of Val-de-Saâne. Taking a northward journey, it flows through the communes of Saâne-Saint-Just, Auzouville-sur-Saâne, Biville-la-Rivière, Brachy, Gueures, Ouville-la-Rivière and Longueil and meets the English Channel between Quiberville and Sainte-Marguerite-sur-Mer. At Longueil, not far from the mouth, the flow is relatively low, at 2.6 m/s, because of the small size of the watershed (270 km), however, at Gueures, on the right bank, a significant tributary, the Vienne river, 15 km in length, joins with the Saane. 
Like most other rivers in the region, the Saâne is classified as a first class river, offering anglers the chance to catch trout and salmon.

Absent Friends (band)

Absent Friends were an ARIA Award winning band from Sydney, Australia. The band was relatively short lived, forming in 1989 and disbanding in 1990. It featured a number of notable Australian musicians including Sean Kelly (Models, The Dukes), James Valentine (Models), Garry Gary Beers (INXS), Geoffrey Stapleton (GANGgajang) and Wendy Matthews.
Biography.
Following the break-up of Models in 1988, Sean Kelly attempted to launch a solo career with the single "Thank You, Goodnight" (March 1988) (which happened to be the name of Models’ last tour), but the single was not a commercial success and in early 1989 Kelly found himself at a loose end. Kelly contacted a number of friends, with a view of putting together an informal band to play a few gigs. The impromptu cooperative was initially dubbed Sean Kelly and His Absent Friends. The initial line-up varied, usually dependant upon the availability of individual members at any given time. Sean Kelly and His Absent Friends kicked off life as a touring act in May 1989, with Kelly (vocals/guitar) joined on occasion by his partner Wendy Matthews (vocals)(who performed backing vocals for Models and was a guest vocalist on the Rockmelons debut and ARIA award winning album, "Tales of the City"), Garry Gary Beers (the bassist for INXS), Nicole Ainslie (keyboards/vocals), Andrew Duffield (keyboards) ex-Models, James Valentine (saxophone) ex-Models, guitarist Michael King ex-Jimmy Barnes, and drummer John MacKay ex-Machinations. Within a couple of months the high profile group were supporting Crowded House at their July 1989 ‘Rock For Land Rights’ concert.
In late 1989 the band entered the recording studio to record a few original tracks that they had been playing live. The first single released by the newly named Absent Friends was "Hallelujah" via the rooArt label. The playing roster on that track comprised Kelly, Matthews, Beers, Ainslie, Duffield, Valentine, King and MacKay, with guest contributions from keyboardist Roger Mason (ex-Models) and INXS drummer Jon Farriss (who contributed percussion to the B-side track "Come Clean"). In early 1990 they recorded their debut album, "Here's Looking Up Your Address", released on rooArt through BMG Music. The album was released in May 1990, and was preceded by Absent Friends’ second single, the quirky soul-funk amalgam "Hullabaloo", which reached number 45 on the Australian charts.
The band's next single "I Don't Want to Be with Nobody but You" was a significant commercial success. It was a cover of the Eddie Floyd classic. The cover to the single credited the song to Absent Friends featuring Wendy Matthews, also guesting on the track was vocalist Peter Blakeley (backing vocals). "I Don’t Want To Be With Nobody But You", peaking at number 4 on the Australian charts during July 1990, and later won the ARIA Award for ‘Best Single’ for 1991. The album "Here's Looking Up Your Address" (rooArt) went to number 7 on the Australian album charts and was certified Gold. The album yielded one more minor hit with "Harmony" reaching number 91 on the Australian singles charts.
In 1990 Absent Friends supported INXS on an eight-week European tour, with ex-Eurogliders bassist Ron Francois taking Beers’ place and GANGgajang keyboardist Geoff Stapleton filling the void on keyboards left by the departure of Andrew Duffield. Ainslie and Valentine also left the band at this time. The band played 10,000 seat stadiums through Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, Holland, Denmark, Scotland, Ireland and England (including five performances at Wembley Arena).
The band continued to tour over the Australian summer of 1990/1991, out of which their final recording surfaced with the live EP, "Networking", which was recorded at the Kardomah Cafe in Kings Cross Sydney. Soon after Kelly decided that Absent Friends had run its course, and the band members went their separate ways.
Matthews soon after recorded her debut album, "Émigré", whilst Kelly and Stapleton pieced together another band during 1991 called The Dukes.
Reformation.
Absent Friends have recently announced a comeback tour of the U.K. The lineup has been changed to incorporate Matthew Wishart and Anthony Harris on guitar and Chris Lings on drums. They plan to independently release an E.P. later this year.

An account of the Daggatun (whose name may perhaps be derived from the Arabic "tughatun" = infidels) was first given by R. Mordecai Abi Sarur or (Mardochée Abi Seror) of Akka (Morocco), who in 1857 journeyed through the Sahara to Timbuktu, and whose account of his travels was published in the "Bulletin de la Société de Géographie" (Dec., 1895; see "Bulletin All. Isr." ii. 42, 1880; "La Grand Encyclopédie," xxiii. 254; Meakin, "Land of the Moors," p. 17). According to R. Mordecai, the Daggatun live in tents and resemble the Berber Tuaregs, among whom they live, in language, religion, and general customs. They are fairer in complexion than the generality of African Jews, and are still conscious of their origin. They are subject to the Tuaregs, who do not intermarry with them. R. Mordecai is authority for the statement that their settlement in the Sahara dates from the end of the seventh century, when 'Abd al-Malik ascended the throne and pushed his conquests as far as Morocco. At Tementit he tried to convert the inhabitants to Islam; and as the Jews offered great resistance he exiled them to the desert of Ajaj, as he did also the Tuaregs, who had only partially accepted Islam. Cut off from any connection with their brethren, these Jews in the Sahara gradually lost their Jewish practises and became nominally Muslims.
These statements of R. Mordecai evidently rest upon some foundation. The Arabs driven to Ajaj are to be identified with the Mechagra mentioned by Erwin de Bary ("Ghat et les Tuareg de l'Ain," p. 181), among whom a few Jews are said still to dwell. V. J. Horowitz ("Morokko," p. 58, Leipsic 1887) also speaks of many free tribes in the desert regions who are Jews by race, but who have gradually thrown off Jewish customs and have apparently accepted Islam. Among these tribes, he says, are the Daggatun, numbering several thousands and scattered over several oases in the Sahara, even as far as the River Dialiva or Niger. He says, also, that they are very warlike and in constant conflict with the Tuaregs. According to Horowitz, the Mechagra mentioned above are also to be reckoned as one of these Jewish tribes.

Sammy McMillan

Samuel Thomas "Sammy" McMillan (born 20 September 1941) is a Northern Irish ex-footballer who played as a left winger or centre forward for various Football League clubs in the 1960s and early 1970s, including Manchester United, Wrexham, Southend United and Stockport County.
Born in Belfast, McMillan started his football career with the Boyland Youth Club in Northern Ireland before being picked up by Manchester United at the age of 16. He signed his first professional contract with the club in November 1959, but it was not until 4 November 1961 that he made his first team debut. The game ended up as a 3–1 defeat by Sheffield Wednesday, but McMillan was not disheartened and went on to score six goals in his first season, in which he played in 11 matches.
McMillan's first season at Old Trafford led to him being picked for the Northern Ireland national team in the autumn of 1962. He played in two matches, against England and Scotland in the 1963 British Home Championship, but failed to get on the scoresheet and only played for his country on one further occasion – an Under-23 international in 1964.
With Manchester United, it was a similar story to his international career that followed for McMillan in 1962–63. He only made four appearances during the entire season, all of which came before Christmas, and he was unable to add to the six goals he scored in his first season. The same happened at the start of the 1963–64 season, and although United manager Matt Busby offered to extend McMillan's contract by a year, the Ulsterman was desperate for first team football and he was sold to Wrexham for £8,000 on Christmas Eve 1963.
McMillan scored a commendable seven goals from 20 appearances in his first season with Wrexham, but it was not enough to prevent the Welsh side from being relegated to the Fourth Division. In five seasons with Wrexham, McMillan scored a total of 52 goals, including a season's best of 18 in 1966–67, and was just one appearance short of 150 for the Red Dragons before being sold to Southend United for £6,000 in 1967. At Southend, McMillan was deployed in a more withdrawn midfield role than he had been with Manchester United and Wrexham, and so he scored just five goals in nearly 80 appearances for the Shrimpers.
After just over two seasons with Southend, a £2,000 move to Wrexham's local rivals Chester City followed, but he was released to sign for Stockport County at the end of the 1969–70 season. At Stockport, McMillan reverted to his old position in the forward line and amassed a total of 29 league goals in 74 appearances before a back injury forced his retirement in 1972.

Combined RF trap

A combined RF trap is a combination of a Quadrupole ion trap (QIT, also called a Paul trap) and a Penning trap. One of the main bottlenecks of a QIT is that it can confine only single-charged species or multiple species with similar masses. But in certain applications like antihydrogen production it is important to confine two species of charged particles of widely varying masses. To achieve this objective, a uniform magnetic field is added in the axial direction of the QIT.

106 Jack FM is an adult hits format radio station broadcasting to a stretch of the English South Coast on 106 MHz & 106.6 MHz FM and on DAB Digital (on NOW South Hampshire). It broadcasts from its Roman Landing studios in Kingsway, Southampton alongside its sister station The Breeze 107 which is also housed in the same building.
History.
It is operated by Celador who bought Original 106 (Solent) from Canwest in August 2008. It replaced "The Coast 106" which in turn replaced Original 106 in October 2008, and while initial RAJAR results were encouraging with a healthy increase over those posted by Original, the weekly reach stagnated at around 115,000 by Q1 2011.
Celador rebranded the station as JACK FM, to bring it in line with its sister station in Bristol, also originally broadcasting as Original 106, on 4 July 2011. At the time of the relaunch as JACK fm, all prior presenters were removed from the station, which switched to a format also used by the UK's other JACK stations - a presenter-led breakfast show (hosted by Bam Bam), and automated music at other times. Like all other JACK fm stations, The South's 106 Jack FM runs with a strapline of "Playing What We Want", which does mean that they will not play any requested songs and will only play the music that they want. Former Blake's 7 actor Paul Darrow often records straplines and does voiceovers for Jack FM, and is referred to on the station only as The Voice of Jack.
Transmitters.
Analogue (FM).
Following the station's previous launch, Coast 106 made use of a Restricted Service Licence from Ofcom to re-broadcast the station to Guernsey. This was done to promote the station to people of Guernsey for when they travel to the mainland.

Polar action

In mathematics, a polar action is a proper and isometric action of a Lie group "G" on a complete Riemannian manifold "M" for which there exists a complete submanifold Σ that meets all the orbits and meets them always orthogonally; such a submanifold is called a section. A section is necessarily totally geodesic. If the sections of a polar action are flat with respect to the induced metric, then the action is called hyperpolar.
In the case of linear orthogonal actions on Euclidean spaces, polar actions are called polar representations. The isotropy representations of Riemannian symmetric spaces are basic examples of polar representations. Conversely, Dadok has classified polar representations of compact Lie groups on Euclidean spaces, and it follows from his classification that such a representation has the same orbits as the isotropy representation of a symmetric space.

Creation (2009 film)

Creation is a 2009 British biographical drama film. Produced by Jeremy Thomas, the film was directed by Jon Amiel, and stars Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly as Charles and Emma Darwin. The film is a partly biographical, partly fictionalised account of Charles Darwin's relationship with his eldest daughter, Annie (Martha West), as he struggles to write "On the Origin of Species". John Collee wrote the script based on Randal Keynes's biography of Darwin titled "Annie's Box".
Plot.
British naturalist Charles Darwin is a young father who lives a quiet life in an idyllic village. He is a brilliant and deeply emotional man, devoted to his wife and children. Darwin is especially fond of his eldest daughter Annie, a precocious and inquisitive ten-year-old. He teaches her much about nature and science, including his theory of evolution, and tells her stories of his travels. Her favourite story, despite the sad ending, is about the young orangutan Jenny, who is brought from Borneo to the London Zoo, where she finally died of pneumonia in the arms of her keeper. Darwin is furious when he learns that the family clergyman has made Annie kneel on rock salt as punishment for contradicting him about the existence of dinosaurs, as their existence and extinction contradicts the church's position that life is unchanging and that the Earth is very young.
Having returned from his expedition in the Galapagos Islands 15 years earlier, Darwin is still working on finishing a manuscript about his findings, which substantiates his theory of evolution. The delay is caused by anxiety about his relationship with his devoutly religious wife, Emma, who fundamentally opposes his ideas and understands the threat to their religion that his work poses. Emma worries that she may go to heaven and he may not, separating them for eternity.
The film shows Annie in flashbacks and hallucinations, a vibrant apparition who goads her father to address his fears and finish his masterwork. It is apparent that Annie has died, and that her death is a taboo subject between Darwin and Emma, as both feel intense blame for her death. As a result of the strained relations between Charles and Emma, they stop making love entirely. Anguished, Darwin begins to suffer from a mysterious, fatiguing illness.
It is revealed that after Annie becomes ill in 1851, Darwin takes her to the Worcestershire town of Malvern for James Manby Gully's water cure therapy, against Emma's will. Annie's condition worsens, and she ultimately dies after her father, at her request, tells her Jenny's story once more. Darwin is devastated, and her death sharpens his conviction that natural laws have nothing to do with divine intervention. To his contemporaries, this is an idea so dangerous it seems to threaten the existence of God. In a box in Darwin's study, we discover the notes and observations that will become "On the Origin of Species".
Having read his 230-page synopsis, Darwin's friends in the scientific community, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley, also encourage him. Huxley admiringly tells Darwin that with his theory he has "killed God", which fills Darwin with dread. In his hallucinations, he also feels that Annie disapproves of his procrastination.
Darwin receives a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858, which details the same findings as Darwin in 20 pages. He has mixed feelings about this; all his work may have been in vain, but on the other hand, as he will not have to write his book, the discord with Emma will heal. However, Darwin's friends will him to continue, as his book is much more comprehensive.
After receiving treatment at Malvern himself, Darwin makes a pilgrimage to the hotel where Annie died. The journey marks a change in him; upon his return home, he is able to reconnect with his wife, and they speak to each other for the first time of their fears and grief over Annie's death. They specifically speak about the possibility that Annie died because she was genetically weak, as Darwin and Emma are closely related cousins. Their renewed devotion restores Darwin's health, and he is able to resume his work, as it also restores Emma's faith in their marriage, and she regains her strength to support his controversial work. Darwin decides that Emma must make the decision about publishing his work. After reading the manuscript, she quietly returns it addressed to John Murray publishers in London. Emma accepts that she is an "accomplice" now, but hopes that God will forgive them both.
Darwin walks down the lane, holding the package. When the postman arrives, Darwin falters, almost letting him go empty-handed. The postman rides away, unaware of the powerful idea about to be released onto the world. As Darwin walks home, the little figure of Annie walks alongside him.
Production.
"Creation" is based on real-life letters and documents of the Darwin family. It is an adaptation of "Annie's Box: Charles Darwin, His Daughter and Human Evolution", a best-selling biography of Charles Darwin by Darwin's great-great grandson Randal Keynes.
The film was produced by Jeremy Thomas at Recorded Picture Company. BBC Films co-developed with assistance from the UK Film Council's development fund. It was completed in England in December 2008. Much of the filming took place in the Wiltshire town of Bradford on Avon (standing in for Malvern), and at Darwin's home, Down House in Kent.
Releases.
The film had its world premiere on 10 September 2009 at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival as the opening night Gala Presentation, the first non-Canadian film since 1996 to be so honoured. The film was released in the UK on 25 September 2009, in Greece on 15 October 2009, in Japan on 20 October 2009 (Tokyo International Film Festival), in New Zealand on 24 December 2009, in the Netherlands on 7 January 2010, in Belgium on 20 January 2010, and in the USA and Canada on 22 January 2010.
According to producer Jeremy Thomas, the United States was one of the last countries to find a distributor due to the prominence of controversy about evolution and creation. Thomas said: "It is unbelievable to us that this is still a really hot potato in America. There's still a great belief that He made the world in six days. It's quite difficult for we in the UK to imagine religion in America. We live in a country which is no longer so religious. But in the US, outside of New York and Los Angeles, religion rules." His comments in the mainstream press, and the publicity surrounding the Toronto premiere, provoked flame wars across religious, atheist, science, and film communities on the Internet. Posts on related blogs such as film critic Roger Ebert's, a noted admirer of Darwin, stretched into the hundreds.
On 24 September 2009, "Variety" reported that Newmarket Films acquired the rights to the film, which was then released on 22 January in the US.
Reception.
The film has received generally mixed reviews. Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 46% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 92 reviews, with an average score of 5.5/10.
Film critic Philip French, writing in "The Observer", called the film "A complex, truthful work that does justice to Darwin's theories and their implications", while his colleague, film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote "This gentle, heartfelt and well-acted film about Charles Darwin and his personal agony preceding the 1859 publication of "On the Origin of Species" does not shy away from the issues. But it personalises them, and places them in a new context."
In "The Telegraph", film critic Tim Robey opined: "Bettany has a genius for distraction and reverie, guiding the film intelligently in and out of its soul-searching flashbacks. Only the closing shot of father and daughter walking hand in hand feels like a sentimental misstep – the one touch too much, in a sad, searching piece of work about the reluctant labour of a great idea. In "Screen International", senior film critic Fionnuala Halligan wrote: "Bettany is undoubtedly the film’s main asset: physically and emotionally convincing as Darwin in a very tricky role. Amiel’s core challenge here is to make audiences believe their story: parents to 10 children, eminent Victorians with an unusual devotion to their brood; the author of a book which changed the world."
Writing in "The Hollywood Reporter", film critic Ray Bennett said "Amiel's greatest achievement is that "Creation" is a deeply human film with moments of genuine lightness and high spirits to go with all the deep thinking."

Thermoacoustic imaging

Thermoacoustic imaging was originally proposed by Theodore Bowen in 1981 as a strategy for studying the absorption properties of human tissue using virtually any kind of electromagnetic radiation. But Alexander Graham Bell first reported the physical principle upon which thermoacoustic imaging is based a century earlier. He observed that audible sound could be created by illuminating an intermittent beam of sunlight onto a rubber sheet. Shortly after Bowen's work was published, other researchers proposed methodology for thermoacoustic imaging using microwaves. In 1994 researchers used an infrared laser to produce the first thermoacoustic images of near-infrared optical absorption in a "tissue-mimicking" phantom, albeit in two dimensions (2D). In 1995 other researchers formulated a general reconstruction algorithm by which 2D thermoacoustic images could be "computed" from their "projections," i.e. thermoacoustic computed tomography (TCT). By 1998 researchers at Indiana University Medical Center extended TCT to 3D and employed pulsed microwaves to produce the first fully three-dimensional (3D) thermoacoustic images of biologic tissue [an excised lamb kidney (Fig. 1). The following year they created the first fully 3D thermoaocustic images of cancer in the human breast, again using pulsed microwaves (Fig. 2). Since that time, thermoacoustic imaging has gained widespread popularity in research institutions worldwide.As of 2008, three companies were developing commercial thermoacoustic imaging systems - Seno Medical,[http://www.senomedical.com/ Endra, Inc.and OptoSonics, Inc.[http://www.optosonics.com
Thermoacoustic wave production.
Sound, which propagates as a pressure wave, can be induced in virtually any material, including biologic tissue, whenever time-varying electromagnetic energy is absorbed. The stimulating radiation that induces these thermally generated acoustic waves may lie anywhere in the electromagnetic spectrum, from high-energy ionizing particles to low-energy radio waves. The term “photoacoustic”Photoacoustic imaging in biomedicine applies to this phenomenon when the stimulating radiation is optical, while “thermoacoustic” is the more general term and refers to all radiating sources, including optical.
The process by which thermoacoustic waves are generated is depicted in the Figure 3. It can be understood as a four-step process:
1. Biologic tissue is irradiated by an energy source that is absorbed by the body. The source of energy is non-specific, but typically consists of visible light, near infrared, radio waves or microwaves.
2. The absorbed energy is converted to heat, which raises the temperature of the tissue, typically by less than 0.001 degree Celsius.
3. The increase in the temperature of the tissue causes the tissue to expand in volume, however slightly.
4. This mechanical expansion produces an acoustic wave that propagates outward in all directions from the sight of energy absorption at the velocity of sound in biologic tissue, approximately 1.5 mm per microsecond.
When the tissue is irradiated with a pulse, the acoustic frequencies that characterize the acoustic wave span a range from zero to 1/(pulse width). E.g., a 1 microsecond pulse produces acoustic frequencies from zero to approximately 1 megahertz (MHz). Shorter pulses produce a wider range of acoustic frequencies. Frequencies greater than 1 MHz are referred to as "ultra"sonic, and are also associated with medical ultrasound applications.
Image formation principles.
Any thermoacoustic imaging device requires a source of electromagnetic radiation, be it a laser or a microwave antenna, to deliver energy to the anatomy being studied, and one or more acoustic detectors coupled acoustically to the outside surface of the anatomy, as is illustrated in Fig. 4. The typical acoustic detector is an ultrasound transducer, which is commonly made of a piezo-electric material that converts detected pressure to an electrical signal. Thermoacoustic waves are induced within the anatomy wherever absorption takes place, and the strength of these thermoacoustic waves is proportional to the energy absorbed within the tissue. Some of these waves propagate through the anatomy over some time interval ("time-of-flight") before being detected by one or more of the acoustic transducers. The exact time-of-flight is proportional to the distance between an absorption site and a transducer, assuming for the moment that each transducer is a "point" detector. For any given time-of-flight, each transducer will receive the sum of the thermoacoustic waves originating at the same distance from the detector in question as is illustrated in Fig. 5. For this reason, ambiguity arises when attempting to localize an aborption site with a point transducer. A variety of stratgies have been employed to mitigate this ambiguity.
Detector geometries.
Three generic detector configurations have been used: a spherically focused transducer; a linear (or curve-linear) array of transducers, focused in one dimension; or, a 2D array of unfocused transducers. In general, a single, focused transducer can image a single "line" through a 3D volume. A linear (1D) array, be it straight or curved, can image a 2D "plane", but to image a full 3D "volume" requires a 2D array of transducers.
Focused Transducer.
A spherically focused transducer is most sensitive to thermoacoustic waves originating along a line passing through its focal point. Time-of-flight information is used to estimate the thermoacoustic signal strength along this line. A 2D image can be assembled a line-at-a-time by translating the focused transducer laterally along a linear path. A 3D image can be built up by scanning the transducer along a rectilinear path within a 2D plane.[http://labs.seas.wustl.edu/bme/Wang/epub/2006HZ-KM-PATfunct.pdf] The ability to distinguish thermoacoustic signals "along" the line of focus ("axial" resolution) is superior to distinguishing thermoacoustic signals transverse to the line of focus ("lateral" resolution). For this reason the lateral spatial resolution is three- to four-times worse than the axial spatial resolution using this approach.
2D array.
Microwaves have also been used to form 3D thermoacoustic images of the human breast. One of the first devices to do so is depicted in Fig. 10. It consisted of an array of eight waveguides, which directed microwave energy into the breast. A transducer array was rotated in synchrony with the waveguides in order to acquire sufficient data to reconstruct the internal structures of the breast. Figure 11 shows an animation of the typical glandular tissue pattern in a normal breast.

Cleofa Malatesta

Cleofa Malatesta da Pesaro (also Cleofe, Cleopa or Cleopha) ("floruit" 1420 – died 1433) was an Italian noblewoman and the wife of Theodore II Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea, brother of Constantine XI, the last Byzantine emperor. She was a daughter of Malatesta dei Sonetti, Count of Pesaro, and Isabella Gonzaga. She married Theodore Palaiologos in Mystras on January 21, 1421, or sometime in 1422 in an arranged marriage that was part of an initiative of her uncle, Pope Martin V, to join Western (Roman Catholic) with Orthodox nobility, who in this way hoped to gain political alliances against the Ottoman Turks.
Marriage.
On the 20th of August 1420, Cleofa left Italy embarking from Fano near Pesaro for Constantinople. She was accompanied by another young bride, Sophia of Montferrat, who was to marry John VIII Palaiologos, Theodore's brother. For the occasion of Cleofa's marriage, a celebratory motet has been preserved written by the famous Renaissance composer Guillaume Dufay, "Vasilissa ergo gaude" ("So rejoice, Queen", using the Greek title for "queen", βασίλισσα). The text of the motet describes her as young, beautiful and a competent speaker of both Italian and Greek. Yet another piece of music praising Cleofa, the ballata "Tra quante regione" was composed in the 1420s by Hugo de Lantins to celebrate her marriage to the Byzantine prince.
Cleofa and Theodoros lived in Mystras in the Peloponnese, one of the last strongholds of Byzantine culture. After some difficult years of marriage, she finally gave in to local pressures and allowed it to be believed that she had converted to the Eastern rite. She had one daughter, Helena Palaiologina, who later married King John II of Cyprus. 
Cleofa died in 1433. Her death was commemorated with speeches by Bessarion, later to become a cardinal in Italy, and in a eulogy written by the eminent Greek neoplatonic philosopher Gemistus Pletho.
Possible grave.
In the 20th century, remains of the body of a woman clothed in western dress were found in a 15th-century grave in the church of Ag. Sophia of Mystras. It has been speculated that this grave may have been Cleofa's.

Optimalniy Variant

Optimalniy Variant (, "Optimal Variant") is a Russian rock group.
It was formed in Moscow, Soviet Union, by Oleg Chilap (also known as "O! Chilap", vocals and acoustic guitar), Alexander Lipnitsky (bass) and Pyotr Anikin (drums), with a purpose to "oppose the existed rock-movements in Moscow". The group was influenced by the music of The Beatles, poems of Alexander Blok and marxist theory. "Optimalniy Variant" became famous after the performance of "Russians in Afghanistan" song in 1980.
The poetry of O! Chilap is full of original metaphors and kalamburs. His lyrics reflect a philosophical view of life, with man's inner freedom constituting the central idea. The group plays a synthesis of ballads and Russian melodies blended together on a blues basis. 
"Optimalniy Variant" was awarded by prizes at rock-festivals, included "Beatlomania" of 1989. They are organizing the "Apple Years Street" Yearly Festival.
Optimalniy Variant was considered by Rossiyskaya Gazeta as the main successor of "post-Beatles period moods and harmonies" on Russian rock scene.

Red Bull Drifting World Championship

The Red Bull Drifting World Championship is a non-championship all-star drifting contest sponsored by Red Bull energy drink and hosted by IMG and Slipstream Global Marketing, the organizers behind Formula D. The event took place at the Port of Long Beach in Long Beach, California on November 15–16, 2008.
Announced prior to the Las Vegas Formula D round on July 14, at $50,000, it boasts of the largest prize money in a drifting contest and the largest TV production for a drift contest.
The inaugural event was won by Rhys Millen, incidentally sponsored by Red Bull, taking home $25,000.
Criteria for eligibility.
As there are 32 places for the event, drivers from all over the world are given a place should they meet these following criteria:
Venue.
Taking place on lot of newly laided up asphalt on Port of Long Beach, in a course known as "Pier S".
The entire venue had to be built from scratch, however temporary. Altogether, the venue in all, accounting for three grandstands, borrowed from those of the Long Beach Grand Prix and the 2,000 seating for VIP and sponsor are designed to accommodate up to 25,000 spectators.
The course length is , with another to allow for a rolling start with six corners outlined by a Red Bull sign. Drivers who had driven on the track are said to be capable of reaching during test runs.
List of invited drivers.
With the exception of Formula D, each series are allocated two entries, including D1GP, who following negotiation, were given six invites
When negotiation broke down, D1 drivers were discouraged from taking invites, therefore they were approached directly by the FD management to find out that they invited entrants, the former D1GP champions in particular, had to decline their entries Millen backed this claim of the organisation's bullying tactic during an interview
Only one FD driver, Tuerck, declined for budgetary reason as he is lacking a title sponsor, funding could not stretch for the event, therefore Mohan took his place. Santos, Bolger and Ruiterman made up the rest of the available slot.

Demographics of Uttar Pradesh

The demographics of Uttar Pradesh is a complex topic, which is undergoing dynamic change. Uttar Pradesh is India`s most populous state. It has a population of about 199,581,477 as per the 2011 census.If it were a separate country, Uttar Pradesh would be the world's fifth most populous nation, next only to China, India, the United States of America and Indonesia. There is an average population density of 828 persons per km² i.e. 2,146 per sq mi. The capital of Uttar Pradesh is Lucknow. Hindus and Muslims consider the state as a holy place.
The peripheral regions of Uttar Pradesh, are home to a number of tribal communities such as Agaria, Baiga, Bhar, Bhoksa, Bind, Chero, Gond, Kol and Korwa. Five of these tribal communities have been recoginised by the Government of India as disadvantaged scheduled tribes, viz. Tharus, Boksas, Bhotias, Jaunswaris and Rajis. The Literacy rate of the state according to the 2011 Census is 69.70%. With the literacy rate for Males at 79.20%, while it is 59.30% for the Females. While this is still below the national average of 74.04% (82.14% for men, 65.16% for women) the rate of growth has been much higher in Uttar Pradesh as compared to the rest of India.
Racial and ancestral makeup.
Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India with a population of over 199.5 million people as of 1 March 2011. If it were a separate country, Uttar Pradesh would be the world's fifth most populous nation, next only to China, India, USA and Indonesia. As of the 2001 census of India, about 80% of Uttar Pradesh population is Hindu, while Muslims make up around 18% of the population. The remaining population consists of Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians and Jains.
The population of Uttar Pradesh is divided into numerous castes and sub-castes. Historically, Hindu society is divided into four sub-divisions or varnas, the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras, with a further fifth group which was considered to be outside the caste system, and are now known as Dalit. In actual practice, Hindu society in North India is divided into numerous lineage groups called jatis. Each jati is then sub-divided into clans, called gotras.
The peripheral regions of Uttar Pradesh, are home to a number of tribal communities such as Agaria, Baiga, Bhar, Bhoksa, Bind, Chero, Gond, Kol and Korwa. Five of these tribal communities have been recoginised by the Government of India as disadvantaged scheduled tribes, viz. Tharus, Boksas, Bhotias, Jaunswaris and Rajis.
Languages.
In terms of languages, most people in Uttar Pradesh speak the various dialects of Hindustani, which in a literate form is referred to as Urdu and Hindi. In addition, Uttar Pradesh is home a number of languages, which are sometimes referred to as dialects. Each of the dialect zone has acquired its own distinctive identity, through myths, legends and folklore. Traditionally, five distinct regions tend to be identified, which correspond to a particular dialect grouping. In western Uttar Pradesh, the region of Rohilkhand and the upper Doab is home to the speakers of Khari Boli. The lower Doab is referred to as Braj Bhumi, or the land of Braj, and is home to the speakers of Braj Bhasha. Further south, the Bundelkhand region is home to Bundelkhandi speakers. In central Uttar Pradesh is the region of Awadh, which is also home to the speakers of Awadhi. And final eastern Uttar Pradesh is home to Bhojpuri speakers. Often these dialects merged into each other, for example in Shahjahanpur, Khari boli merges into Awadhi.
However, older districts of Basti, Jaunpur,and western Mirzapur in Purvanchal and Shahjehanpur, Pilbhit, Eastern Badayun and Eastern Farrukhabad in central UP are Awadhi speaking.
Religion.
In U.P. the religion-wise percentage of population is Hindus 80.61, Muslims 18.50, Sikhs 0.41, Jains 0.12, Buddhists 0.18, Christians 0.13, Others not specified 0.05.

<doc id="19820195" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19820195" title="Indiana Gas Boom">
Indiana Gas Boom

The Indiana Gas Boom was a period of active drilling and production of natural gas in the Trenton Gas Field, in the US state of Indiana and the adjacent northwest part of Ohio The boom began in the early 1880s and lasted into the early twentieth century.
When the Indiana natural gas belt was discovered, the citizens were unaware of what they had found; nearly a decade passed without action to recover the resource. Once its significance was realized, further exploration showed the Indiana gas belt was the largest deposit of natural gas discovered until then. In addition to the massive quantity of natural gas, in the 1890s developers discovered that the field also contained the first giant oil reserve found in the United States, with an estimated one billion barrels of oil. The resource was rapidly tapped for use. Because the gas was being wasted in use, the Indiana General Assembly attempted to regulate its use. In a series of cases, the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law.
The poor understanding of oil and gas wells at the time led to the loss of an estimated 90% of the natural gas by venting into the atmosphere or by widespread misuse. By 1902 the yield from the fields began to decline, leading to a switch to alternative forms of energy. With most of the gas removed from the field, there was no longer enough pressure to pump the oil out of the ground. An estimated of oil remain in the field. Advancements in artificial lift technology have led to extraction of some of the oil, but at a relatively slow rate and high cost compared to more productive fields.
Discovery.
Natural gas was first discovered in Indiana in 1876. Coal miners in the town of Eaton were boring a hole in search of coal. After they reached a depth of about , a loud noise came from the ground and a foul odor came from the hole. The event scared the miners. Some believed that they had breached the ceiling of Hell. They plugged the hole and did not drill any more at that location.
In 1884, natural gas was discovered in Ohio and the news of the discovery was published in the local Indiana newspapers. Residents of Eaton remembered the early incident near their town and realized the magnitude of the discovery. Returning to the site, a company reopened the hole and drilled down another deeper, releasing a large amount of gas. When the escaping gas was ignited, the flame reached twelve feet into the air and could be seen from the neighboring town of Muncie.
Gas fever swept the state and thousands of gas wells were created. Explorers found that the gas field was the largest of natural gas fields found up to that date, covering an area of . The belt came to be called the Trenton Gas Field. Drillers found large quantities of oil in addition to the natural gas. The Trenton Gas Field was almost completely interconnected, so a well at any one location lowered pressure across the entire field. Whenever new holes were bored, a pipe was created off the main line. It was lit with a constant flame as proof that the gas was flowing. Although burning such a flame wasted massive amounts of the resource, the practice became common. The constant burning gas flame was called a ""flambeau"".
Boom.
The gas discovery stimulated the development of industry in northern Indiana. The Ball Corporation opened in Muncie, using the cheap fuel to make glass. Other manufacturers also moved into the area, including the Kokomo Rubber Company; Hemmingray Bottle and Insulating Glass Company; and Maring, Hart, and Company.
Iron and other metal manufacturers set up large factories attracted by the cheap fuel. The cheap fuel was a primary reason that U.S. Steel chose northern Indiana for their operations. Other cities across northern Indiana also grew, including Hartford City and Gas City. Gas City was in the center of the gas field and had access to the strongest pressures, with between and . In 1892 Gas City had a population of 150, but two years later its population had increased to 25,000.
Cities outside the field were piped gas, and the fuel was exported across the Midwest. The Indiana Natural Gas and Oil was formed by a group of Chicago businessmen led by Charles Yerkes. The company hired Elwood Haynes as their superintendent and he oversaw the laying of the first long distance natural gas pipeline in the United States, connecting Chicago with the Trenton Field over away. One major use for the gas was to power lighting. The wealth and industry brought by the wells led to a rapid population shift into northern Indiana. Southern Indiana, by comparison, had never recovered from the embargo during the Civil War and was in economic decline. The northern part of the state attracted new jobs. The boom led to rapid development of pumping and piping technology by the regions gas and oil companies. Inventors, like Elwood Haynes developed many different devices and methods that advanced the industry.
As the use of the gas grew, many scientists warned that more gas was being wasted than was effectively used by industry, and that the supplies would soon run out. Almost every town in northern Indiana had one or more gas wells. Producers lit a flambeau at the top of each well to show the gas was still flowing. The Indiana General Assembly attempted to stop the practice by limiting open burning. The law met with tough opposition. Many town leaders, who had come to rely on the gas revenues dismissed claims that the wells would run dry. This practice wasted much gas; INGO conducted its own investigation and found that its flambeaus wasted $10,000 in gas daily, and ordered the practice stopped. Despite their findings, the other companies did not follow their example. Although INGO implemented anti-waste measures, they were virulently opposed to the regulations that they viewed as hampering to productivity—primarily the regulations aimed at artificially increasing gas pressure.
Elwood Haynes filed a suit a month after the regulations were passed into law, claiming that the government had no authority to regulate the industry. The challenge dragged on in court for several years until the Indiana Supreme Court declared the regulatory laws constitutional in 1896.
Almost every community in the Trenton Field had a gas well. Many were purchased by local governments, which used revenues for community amenities. Many towns and cities installed free gas lighting throughout their communities, supplied by their own gas wells. Communities also piped gas to private homes to provide cheap heating fuel, helping to make urban living more desirable. Gas was used to produce electricity that ran electric street cars in several cities. Businessmen also established corporations to purchase the gas from the local markets and sell it wholesale on the national market.
Decline.
Wasteful practices rapidly depleted the gas field. By the turn of the century, output from the wells began to decline. Some flambeaus had been burning for nearly two decades; slowly their flames became shorter and weaker. Modern experts estimate that as much as 90% of the natural gas was wasted in flambeau displays. By 1903 factories' and towns' need for alternate sources of energy led to creation of numerous coal-burning electric plants.
Oil lasted a few years longer, but inexperience in the early oil drilling industry led to problems. Producers were unaware of the relation between the pressure provided by natural gas and the ability to pump oil from wells. The pressure began to decline rapidly towards the turn of century. In 1895 the pressure was at 164 psi, in 1897 it was 191 psi, in 1898 173 psi. As the pressure decreased to around 150 psi, oil began to move into the upper part of the field, but since the natural gas had been released and pressure dropped between 130 psi, there was no way to pump out the remaining oil in the field.
Oil production in Indiana peaked in 1905 with over pumped that year. By 1910 the once abundant resources had slowed to a trickle. By then new industry had moved into the state, and decline of the gas industry did not have a major negative impact. The availability of cheap energy had drawn so much new industry that Indiana had become one of the leading industrial states. The economy of northern Indiana continued to flourish until the Great Depression began in the following decade. In total, over of natural gas and of oil are estimated to have been extracted from the field.
Smaller pockets of natural gas exist in Indiana at depths that could not be reached in the boom era. The state still had a small natural gas producing industry in 2008, but residents and industry consume about twice as much natural gas as the state produces. In 2005 there were 338 active natural gas wells on the Trenton Field. In 2006 Indiana produced more than of natural gas. This made it the 24th largest producing state, far below the major producers.
It is estimated that only 10% of the oil was drilled from the Trenton Field, and approximately may remain. Because of the size of the field, pumping gas back into the well to increase pressure, as is commonly done in smaller fields, is impossible. Because of the depth and limitations of hydraulic pumps, it was never cost effective to use them to extract oil. It was not until the 1990s that efficient methods of artificial lift were discovered. This has allowed some of the oil to extracted, but at far higher cost than when sufficient natural gas is present.

Plantage Savonet in Christoffelpark is one of the earliest plantations to be founded on Curaçao. the irrigation system is still reasonably intact. Attempts were made to cultivate aloe, indigofera, sorghum, corn, cotton, and beans. Cows, sheep, goats and poultry were also farmed on the plantation.
The plantation houses of Savonet and Zorgvlied (situated at the mountain side of the park) were built on the island in the eighteenth century. Of Zorgvlied only ruins remain. About west of Zorgvlied ruins is the house of the 'bomba', the slave in charge of other slaves, and a 'slave-pole'.
Roads in the park were bitumised in 2004.
Flora and fauna.
Chistoffelpark has more biodiversity than elsewhere on the island. Flora present in the park includes three pillar cacti species ('datu', 'Kadushi', and 'Kadushi di pushi'), divi-divi trees and exotic flowers. Cacti in the park reach up to ten feet high, and several extremely rare orchids, such as the Lady of the Night and Humboldt's Schomburgkia, can be found blooming on them. Plant species occurring only in Christoffelpark include "Myrcia curassavica", endemic to Curaçao, and "Maytenus versluysii", endemic to Curaçao and Bonaire.
Fauna notable in the park includes mammals like the white-tailed deer, the cottontail, and several species of bats, birds like the rare White-tailed Hawk, an endemic subspecies of Barn Owl ("Tyto alba bargei"), hummingbirds like the Common Emerald and the Crimson Topaz, and the endemic Yellow Oriole. Reptiles and insects are also well represented.
Tourism.
There are eight hiking trails in the park, of which the Christoffel Mountain climb is the most challenging. Visitors are advised to attempt this climb early in the morning. There are four sealed road routes through the park. Organised park tours include a deer-spotting sunset tour, a pick-up safari, and the "Savonet history" tour.

__NOTOC__
The Yakovlev Yak-33 was a vertical take-off and landing supersonic multi-purpose aircraft family, studied in the early 1960s, with variants of a basic design used to fulfill different roles, in a similar fashion to the Yak-25, Yak-27, Yak-28 family.
Several configurations were studied including canard and tailless deltas, however matching supersonic performance with VTOL ability seriously compromised the designs ability to carry out its primary missions.

James Douglas Edgar

James Douglas Edgar (30 September 1884 – 8 August 1921) was an English professional golfer and golf writer.
Life and career.
Edgar was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. He won the French Open in 1914. He coached the young player Tommy Armour, who became a prominent professional after 1920; Armour later praised Edgar as having helped him the most. The legendary Harry Vardon stated that Edgar was on his way to becoming a player who could surpass everyone.
Edgar emigrated to the United States in April 1919, following World War I. He was the head professional at Druid Hills Golf Club in Atlanta. Edgar played frequently with the young Bobby Jones at the Atlanta Athletic Club (the site of today's East Lake Golf Club) from 1919–1921. He mentored and coached Jones during this period as well. Jones developed into one of the dominant golfers of the 1920s.
Edgar won the Canadian Open in 1919 at the Hamilton Golf and Country Club by a record 16 strokes (a winning margin which still stands for a PGA Tour event), with Jones second, and came back the next year to win that title again. He lost the 1920 PGA Championship, one of golf's majors, in a match play final to Jock Hutchison. During 1919–20, Edgar was among the top players in the world.
Edgar wrote a golf book entitled "The Gate to Golf", based on his discoveries made in England. Edgar had an ailing hip which he could not turn freely. Through experimentation, he found that a restricted hip turn still allowed a repeatable swing with excellent power and control. This book proved to have significant impact on golf instruction, right up to the present time.
Death.
Edgar's death was mysterious. He was found late at night on an Atlanta street, bleeding heavily from a deep wound in his leg, and died in the street before any trained help could arrive. The case was turned over to police, but never solved. He left a wife and two children in England. In an article published in "Sports Illustrated" in April 2010, writer Steve Eubanks wrote that Edgar was having an affair with a married Atlanta woman, and that this likely played a central role in Edgar's death. Eubanks' article was an excerpt from his book "To Win and Die in Dixie", a biography of Edgar published later that year.

Sampson Simson

Sampson Simson (born 1780, died 1857) was an American philanthropist most remembered as "the father of Mount Sinai Hospital" and as benefactor, posthumously, to the North American Relief Society for Indigent Jews in Jerusalem, Palestine.
Biography.
Simson was born in Danbury, Connecticut. He studied under Aaron Burr, attended Columbia University in New York City, and graduated in 1800 with a degree in law, becoming one of the first Jewish lawyers in New York City.
After a few years practice, however, Simson abandoned his law career and retired to his Yonkers farm to devote himself to charitable work. Described as a very pious man with a "New England conscience", a combination of a "public-spirited citizen" and "conformist Jew", Simson received great pleasure from his charitable contributions, be they to a Catholic church, a Protestant church or a synagogue.
From 1825 until 1832, Simson served as Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry (Northern Jurisdiction).
In 1852, Simson, along with eight other men representing various Hebrew charitable organizations, came together to establish the "Jew's Hospital", the institution that eventually (in 1866) became Mount Sinai Hospital. Its location, West 28th Street between 7th and 8th Avenues in New York City, was on land donated by Simson; he served the first President of its Board of Directors and personally assumed many of the young hospital's financial burdens. "The Jew's Hospital" opened two years before his death. 
That same year, Simson joined Samuel Myer Isaacs and Adolphus Simeon Solomons to help found the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol.
Legacy.
Simson's estate bequeathed large sums of money to Jewish and general institutions, including $50,000 that, after the death of a nephew, should be paid "to any responsible corporation in this city whose permanent fund is established by its charter for the purpose of ameliorating the condition of the Jews in Jerusalem, Palestine." In 1888, the New York State Supreme Court decided that the sum, plus thirty years' interest, was to be paid to the North American Relief Society for Indigent Jews in Jerusalem.
Mount Sinai Hospital was recently ranked as one of the best hospitals in the United States by U.S. News & World Report.

Sylva Foundation

The Sylva Foundation is a tree and forestry organisation established in 2008, and registered as a charity in England and Wales in 2009. It is based in a rural location in the small village of Little Wittenham in Oxfordshire, England. It is concerned with the advancement and promotion of sustainable forest management.
It was the brain child of Sir Martin Wood and Dr Gabriel Hemery and was formed through the work of the forestry think tank Forestry Horizons, established in 2006.
Sylva is a charity that places economics at the heart of its support for sustainable forest management. It has a national perspective with a focus on practical solutions at local and regional levels. Sylva is not a membership-based charity. It functions as a lean organisation, working widely in partnership with other organisations.
The Sylva Foundation's main programmes are Forestry, Education and Science.
Science.
Sylva runs the forestry think-tank, Forestry Horizons, which operates at national and international levels seeking to advance and support forest science (e.g., ) and forest policy (e.g., ). It has produced a range of forestry publications for and with external partners (e.g., and ), peer reviewed publications (e.g. ), and provided public presentations (e.g. ).
Sylva are developing a new applied science project with partners to study the links between environmental stress and tree health.
Education.
Their main education project is the OneOak project. OneOak was launched in 2009 and is following the life story of one oak tree. It is aimed at improving people's understanding and knowledge of growing trees for wood.
Sylva collaborates with Forest School at a county level with the Oxfordshire Forest School Service. It is also developing plans to support a new national co-ordinator for England.
Forestry.
Sylva is aiming to revitalise the wood culture in Great Britain via an ambitious new project: myForest. The concept is that woodland owners map and measure their woodlands and add them to a google map-based website. If they complete an inventory of these woodlands then this will provide all the information necessary for wood buyers to contact them, anonymously, to discuss the procurement of timber. Plans are also being developed to link these woodland inventories with the regulatory framework.
The Sylva Foundation has close links with many organisations as it seeks to work as a catalyst for innovation and as bridge between forestry-related organisations. Of particular note are:

Carl Andrew Capasso

Carl Andrew Capasso (September 10, 1945 - March 14, 2001) a.k.a. Andy Capasso, was a sewer contractor with ties to organized crime, who had been convicted of tax fraud and later of bribing a judge. He was accused of bribing judge Hortense Gabel by arranging, for the judge's daughter Sukhreet Gabel, a job with Bess Myerson. Myerson was indicted and resigned her positions with the City of New York, but was ultimately acquitted. The scandal was the subject of "When She Was Bad", a book by Shana Alexander published in 1991.
Biography.
He was born in Brooklyn on September 10, 1945 to Josephine and Michael E. Capasso. He married Nancy Herbert in 1966. 
He started a construction company, Nanco Contracting Corporation, and won several contracts in New York City for sewer repair. In 1987 he was charged with writing off $1.2 million in renovations on his two Manhattan apartments as business expenses; and for receiving $300,000 in fraudulent damage claims against his own company without paying taxes on the income.
He was convicted of tax evasion and his company was barred from working for New York City. 
He then served a four year federal prison sentence at Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood. In 1989 he used a front company to win a new contract.
He started dating Bess Myerson, and when his wife found out, they divorced. He was ordered to pay $1,500 a week in support by Judge Hortense Gabel. Capasso had Bess Myerson hire the daughter of Judge Gabel at the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs. Gabel then lowered his support payments to $500 a week. He died of pancreatic cancer on March 14, 2001 at age 51.

<doc id="19820372" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19820372" title="HiperDispatch">
HiperDispatch

HiperDispatch is a workload dispatching feature found in the newest IBM mainframe models (the System z10 and IBM zEnterprise System processors) running recent releases of z/OS. HiperDispatch was introduced in February, 2008.
One of the engineering challenges with large SMP server designs is to maintain near-linear scalability as the number of CPUs increases. Performance and throughput do not double when doubling the number of processors. There are many overhead factors, including contention for cache and main memory access. These overhead factors become increasingly difficult to mitigate as the number of CPUs increases. The design goal for delivering maximum performance is to minimize those overhead factors. Each new mainframe model supports a higher maximum number of CPUs (up to 64 main processors in a single System z10 mainframe for example), so this engineering challenge becomes ever more important.
HiperDispatch helps address the problem through a combination of hardware features, z/OS dispatching, and the z/OS Workload Manager. In z/OS there may be tasks waiting for processing attention, such as transaction programs. Each task often requires access to memory. In a large SMP design such as System z, some CPUs are physically "closer" with faster access to cache memory that might hold supporting data for particular tasks. HiperDispatch exploits this fact and steers tasks to the CPUs most likely to have the fastest access to relevant data already in cache. If that particular CPU is busy, HiperDispatch will, at first, wait for it to finish its other task, even if another less favorable CPU is idle. However, there are limitations to how patient HiperDispatch will be, as governed by Workload Manager goals. If z/OS Workload Manager senses that there's a risk the pending task will miss its service level (responding within a certain number of milliseconds to a user request for example), Workload Manager and HiperDispatch will send the task over to an idle CPU for processing, even if that CPU must fetch data from slower main memory.
Benefit.
HiperDispatch offers very little CPU savings benefit on machines configured with a relatively small number of CPUs. However, the feature does help quite a lot as the CPU count increases. IBM mainframe capacity tables (and thus its software pricing) are all based on the assumption that HiperDispatch is active.
The other benefit of HiperDispatch - "parking" logical CPUs so that the number of CPUs on which z/OS dispatches work more closely matches the LPAR's weight - is applicable to even small machine configurations. (The benefit of this is the reduction of the "short engine" effect, making system performance more responsive.
Implementation.
Workload Manager (WLM) must be configured correctly for HiperDispatch to work well. Some mainframe users have latent problems with their WLM goal settings which are only exposed with HiperDispatch, so there is an option to disable HiperDispatch in those cases where mainframe users do not want to correct those issues right away.

Carl Hasenpflug

Carl Hasenpflug (1802–1858) was a German artist who specialized in landscape painting, primarily the rendering of architecture. 
Biography.
Born in Berlin, Hasenpflug was first apprenticed as a shoemaker to his father, then to the decorative painter Carl Gropius. By 1822 he had become known as a painter of architectural subjects, with particular focus on the representation of medieval German churches; a primary example is "View of the Garrison Church in Potsdam" (Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlin), in which architectural details were first drawn in pen, then glazed over with oil paint. Favorite subjects also included the cathedrals of Magdeburg and Halberstadt, where he lived from 1828.
After 1838 Hasenpflug concentrated on paintings of snow-covered ruins that combined factual observation with fantasy. "Snowdrifts in the Cloister of the Halberstadt Cathedral" (Städtisches Museum, Halberstadt), displays a more painterly manner than previous renderings, and evidences the artist's response not only to the subject's visual appeal, but also suggests the vulnerability of the medieval structure and the spiritual haven it represents. Other noted works include two views of Cologne Cathedral (1832-33), Erfurt Cathedral (1827), “Mediæval Castle Yard” (1842, Schwerin Gallery), and “Ruined Chapel” (Stettin Museum).
He died in Halberstadt in 1858.

Busha (, ) is a village in Yampilskyi Raion, Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine. It got the status of a city in the early 17th century. In 1629 there were 2.000 people living in this city. 
History.
Historical settlements in the area date back to several ancient civilizations, including Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, Scythia, Chernyakhov culture, and Old East Slavic cultures.
Busha is known in history because of the Peace of Busza that was signed in this village between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire on September 23, 1617. During the mid-17th century, the city, situated in Bracław Voivodeship of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was also the site of several battles between Poles and Ukrainian Cossacks. 
After the destruction of the fortress in November 1654 the city soon lost its status and was degraded to village. The village has several historical monuments such as the ruins of a 15th-16th-century fortress and a town hall.

The Consonant C

The Consonant C are a Canadian alternative pop group formed in 2005 in Calgary. They are currently unsigned. They pull their influences from various genres of music including classical, jazz, punk rock and folk. Under the name The Summerwood Warren they co-organize and perform in monthly themed music and art shows, which bring together members from the Calgary arts community.
History.
The Consonant C was formed by six friends in Calgary, Alberta. Clea Foofat and Laura Leif got their start as a duo. Jennifer Crighton and Jared Andres joined the band and the quartet recorded and released the five song EP "Bunnyfish" in December 2005. The EP was primarily songs that Clea Foofat and Laura Leif had written. The group then went on hiatus to pursue other projects and interests but came back together in 2006 with the addition of bassist Mark Connolley-Mendoza. The band's first show was opening for Montreal's Camaromance at a community hall in Calgary in the fall of 2006. Acoustic bassist Danny Vescarelly was the last member to join the group. The band began recording their first full length album "Capes and Crowns" in May, 2007. It was recorded at a basement studio, Calgary's Outhouse, by engineer Grant Howarth. It was released August 19, 2007. The band toured the West Coast (with dates in the United States) following the completion of their album.
The band also works as The Summerwood Warren music collective to co-organize and participate in all-ages theme shows. The shows include musical events, performance art, and video pieces and are a mechanism for artists in Calgary to meet and make music and art together. They are mainly held at EMMedia. Each show follows a particular theme. Past themes have included a forest show, where the performers dressed as fauna, and a spelunking show, where the only light in the performance came from head lamps worn by the performers and flashlights audience members carried. The Summerwood Warren music collective acts a facilitator for Calgary's music community but hopes to expand and act as a point of contact for Canada-wide musicians looking to set up tours.
The band disbanded in early 2009 due to creative differences. Each of the band members has pursued careers in different musical directions.
Personnel.
The band is now a six member, multi-instrumental ensemble. Current members are Mark Connolley-Mendoza (bass, banjo, guitar, vocals), Laura Leif (ukulele, guitar, bass, piano, glockenspiel, vocals), Jennifer Crighton (harp, glockenspiel, vocals), Clea Foofat (piano, cello, ukulele, glockenspiel, vocals), Jared Andres (drums) and Danny Vescarelly (guitar, mandolin, bass). The band had previously gone through four and five member incarnations before adding more members to the group and becoming a sextet.
Music and Discography.
Discography: "Bunnyfish" (5 Song EP, 2005); "Capes and Crowns" (Full length album, August 19, 2007).
Since its release in 2007, "Capes and Crowns", has made it in the top ten in Vancouver, Prince George, Edmonton, Sudbury and Halifax and has reached number one in Calgary and Lethbridge.
The Consonant C's music has been described as "soft and subtle, yet powerful nonetheless" and filled with "childlike glee through the lens of grownup music". One song on their full length album, "Capes and Crowns", is dedicated to indie band Azeda Booth. The song recalls "wintertime toboggan adventures and other such, whimsical Narnia-esque adventures".
The band continues to perform shows and expand through collaborations. In January, 2008 they performed with the Summerlad as part of One Yellow Rabbit's High Performance Rodeo. In 2008, they also performed shows at the Sled Island Festival and the Calgary Folk Festival.
In January 2009 the band released a new song called "So Awesome", available for streaming through its MySpace page.

The 2001 Kangaroo Tour was a truncated Kangaroo tour which featured only the thee Ashes series Test matches against Great Britain. The tour was almost abandoned due to military action in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Australia continued its dominance, winning two of the three tests against Great Britain and retaining The Ashes that they have held since 1973.
The 2001 Kangaroo tour was initially cancelled by the Australian Rugby League (ARL) but after strong public opinion in both Great Britain and Australia, it went ahead. However, the only games played were the three tests, marking the first Kangaroo Tour to not play against any British club teams. The 2001 tour was also the first since 1952-53 not to include a test series against France following The Ashes series.
The team was coached by Chris Anderson who was making his third Kangaroo Tour, and first as coach, after playing in the 1978 and 1982 tours, the second as a member of the famed "Invincibles". Team captain was Brad Fittler who was making his third and last Kangaroo Tour after being part of the successful 1990 and 1994 touring teams. Fittler was also the only member of the squad that had previously taken part in a Kangaroo tour.

Sheryll D. Cashin

Sheryll D. Cashin is a law professor at Georgetown University. She was born and raised in Huntsville, Alabama, where her parents were political activists. Her mother Joan and father John were both involved in the civil rights movement, which greatly influenced her belief about the importance of political engagement, and instilled values which she researches and discusses today.
Family and Home.
Political involvement and activism has been a very common ideal in Sheryll Cashin’s family which is what subsequently has led to Cashin’s pursuit of racial issues including segregation and inequality. Her father John L. Cashin, Jr. challenged George Wallace in the 1970 gubernatorial election in Alabama. At the start of the civil rights movement in early 1962, and at four months old, Cashin’s mother was arrested while being involved in a sit-in protest at a lunch counter, while still holding on to Sheryll. Her father John was a dentist and was also one of the most influential civil-rights leaders in Huntsville and Alabama in the late 1960s. He founded a black-led third party in Alabama, the National Democratic Party of Alabama (NDPA), during the height of George Wallace’s hegemony and succeeded in efforts to enfranchise thousands of voters who had previously been excluded from the political process through Jim Crow laws. Cashin’s great-grandfather, Herschel V. Cashin was a radical Republican legislator in Alabama during Reconstruction. He was born in Antebellum, Georgia, and was the child of a white Irishman and a free-mulatto woman.
Sheryll Cashin’s family also became the first black family on the block, when they moved in 1966 from Lydia Drive in northwest Huntsville to Owens Drive, at the foot of Monte Sano.
Education.
Sheryll Cashin graduated summa cum laude from Vanderbilt University in 1984 with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. She also obtained her masters in English Law with honors from Oxford University in 1986 as a Marshall Scholar, and obtained her JD with honors from Harvard Law School.
Career.
While working in the Clinton White House, Cashin served as an advisor on urban and economic policy, particularly concerning community development in inner-city neighborhoods. She was also law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and Judge Abner Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Sheryll Cashin also worked as an Associate Counsel for the Office of Transition Counsel and as an associate at Sirote & Permutt, P.C.
As a Professor of Law at Georgetown University, Sheryll Cashin teaches Constitutional Law, Local Government Law, Property, Administrative Law, and Race and American Law. She writes about race relations, government and inequality in America, as well as housing segregation.
Literary career.
Sheryll Cashin has written two books so far: "The Failures of Integration: How Race and Class are Undermining the American Dream," which depicts how segregation by race and class is ruining American democracy. After studying data on school enrollment and census tracts, Cashin drew that racial separation still persists in schools and communities. She argues that we need a transformation of the now ingrained assumption that separation is acceptable-in order to solve the riddle of inequality in America." 
"The Agitator's Daughter: A Memoir of Four Generations of One Extraordinary African-American Family." This book covers the arc of U.S. relations from slavery through the post-civil rights era.
Cashin has also contributed book chapters. She also has written journal articles, and is a frequent radio and T.V. commentator. She has appeared on "NPR All Things Considered, The Diane Rehm Show, The Tavis Smiley Show, The Newshour With Jim Lehrer," CNN, BET, ABC News, and numerous local programs.

Cross merchandising

Cross merchandising is the practice of marketing, or displaying products from different categories (or store departments) together, in order to generate additional revenue, known sometimes as "add-on sales", or "incremental purchase". This can often be done in conjunction with "customer-centric" strategies, aimed at improving the overall customer experience. 
Product selection in most retail environments is based on consumer usage patterns. Retail stores will also sometimes categorize certain demographics of customers, such as "hockey mom", "students", "techies", etc. in order to target product offerings more narrowly. Examples would include:

Siboney (rum)

Siboney is the name and brand of a variety of rums from the Dominican Republic produced by Bodegas Cochón-Calvo, S.A.
History.
Originated in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic in 1920. Siboney was a rum that appears to have been introduced in the United States around the 1930s. The idea behind the rum was to bring in a Cuban rum-master named Señor Alvare to produce a Cuban style rum in the US with Cuban ingredients and knowledge. This way customers would not pay any duty on their purchase, at least this was one of the selling points.
Aging and blending.
Rums are aged in white oak casks, previously used for bourbon, with a minimum aging of 14 months for the lower tiers.
Accolades.
Siboney rums generally have received modest scores from spirit ratings organizations. For example, the Blanco and Dorado earned bronze medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Although the Reserva earned a silver medal from the San Francisco competition, it performed slightly worse at the Beverage Testing Institute (BTI). BTI gave the Reserva a score of 84, below the scores of 86-87 it gave to the Blanco and Dorado.

Hortense Gabel

Hortense Wittstein Gabel (December 16, 1912 – December 6, 1990) was an American lawyer who served on the New York Supreme Court. Her judicial career came to an end after she was charged with lowering alimony payments for Carl Andrew Capasso in exchange for a position for her daughter at the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, which was then headed by Capasso's lover Bess Myerson.
Biography.
She was born as Hortense Wittstein in the Bronx on December 16, 1912 to Bessie and Rubin J. Wittstein. She attended Hunter College High School. She graduated from Hunter College in 1934 and earned her law degree from Columbia Law School in 1937 and went to work at her father's law firm. She left her father's law firm in 1944 to marry Dr. Gabel, a United States Army dentist stationed at Fort Hood, Texas.
Gabel had her first association with housing in 1955, when she was appointed as general counsel to the Temporary State Rent Commission. In May 1959 she was hired by the city to create a neighborhood conservation program and was given a second position in 1960 as an assistant to the mayor on slum clearance issues. On April 12, 1962, Mayor of New York City Robert F. Wagner, Jr. appointed her to head the city's Rent and Rehabilitation Agency, in which she oversaw the nearly 5,000,000 residents living in rent controlled apartments.
While under investigation in the Myerson case, Gabel was removed from her position as a trial judge in June 1987 by Milton Williams, the deputy chief administrative judge for the city's courts. After a two-month-long trial, Gabel was acquitted in December 1988 of charges that she had reduced Andy Capasso's alimony payments in exchange for Bess Myerson hiring Gabel's daughter Sukhreet to a $19,000 position as a special assistant.
Gabel died of heart failure at age 77 on December 6, 1990.

Almast

Almast ( meaning "diamond") is the only opera of the Armenian composer Alexander Spendiaryan.
History.
In 1916 Spendiarian met Armenian poet Hovhannes Tumanian, who suggested three of his poems "Anush", "Parvana" and "The Siege of the Tmbouk Castle" as themes for a national Armenian opera. Spendiaryan listened to the prelude of the last poem and was immediately attracted by its beauty. According to Tumanian's daughter, he was fascinated by Firdousi's poem in the banquet scene, by Tatoul's nightmare, and by the ambitious Almast - who dreamed of winning the throne. Tumanian also organized special musical evenings for Spendiarian in his own home and then at Tbilisi's Music School, in which national musicians and minstrels took part. 
At this stage Spendiarian, a Russian-Armenian, began to make a detailed study of Armenian folk music. He wrote: "Amongst the large amount of material I was particularly struck by Nikoghayos Tigranyan's music, on which I composed some of the instrumental passages in my opera". Because of the pressure of work, Tumanian was forced to abandon the idea of writing the libretto himself, and the task was undertaken by Russian poetess Saphy Parnok. In 1916 the libretto was ready, and Spendiaryan began work on the opera, and finished the opera's vocal score in 1923. He continued his work on the instrumentation right up to his death. The instrumantation of the forth act of "Almast" was completed by M. O. Shteinburg. Music plays an important role. 
According to musical critic A. Shahverdian, "it is here that the basis was laid for a new style of Armenian national music."
Performances.
The first performance of "Almast" took place in 1930 at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow. On January 20, when the Yerevan State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet was opened, a performance of the opera was given in Armenian in Tigran Hakhumyan's translation. It was performed also in Tbilisi, Tashkent, Novosibirsk and Odessa. It was re-staged in Yerevan also in 1939, 1969, 1971 and 1983.
In 1951 The Russian Chamber Opera Theatre in Paris gave a performance of "Almast" in the Mutualite Hall.

1994 RHI season

The 1994 RHI season was the 2nd season of Roller Hockey International. It began on June 4, 1994, with the regular season ending in August. The Murphy Cup playoffs ended in September, with the Buffalo Stampede defeating the Portland Rage to win their first Murphy Cup. The Vancouver Voodoo hosted the 1st RHI All-Star Game at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, British Columbia on July 9, 1994.
League business.
Franchise changes.
Arena changes.
The Vancouver Voodoo played games at both their original home the PNE Agrodome, as well as the much larger Pacific Coliseum. The Calgary Rad'z made the Max Bell Centre their permanent home arena. The Anaheim Bullfrogs' home, Anaheim Arena, was renamed the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim.
New logos and uniforms.
The Anaheim Bullfrogs, Florida Hammerheads, Los Angeles Blades, and Oakland Skates debuted new logos and uniforms for the season, while the San Diego Barracudas and St. Louis Vipers debuted new uniforms.
Contraction.
The Toronto Planets folded after only one season in the league.
Relocation.
The Connecticut Coasters relocated to Sacramento, California to become the Sacramento River Rats, and the Utah Rollerbees relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada to become the Las Vegas Flash.
Expansion.
The league doubled in size from 12 teams to 24 by adding 13 new franchises, including the Atlanta Fire Ants, Buffalo Stampede, Chicago Cheetahs, Edmonton Sled Dogs, Minnesota Arctic Blast, Montreal Roadrunners, New England Stingers, New Jersey Rockin Rollers, Philadelphia Bulldogs, Phoenix Cobras, Pittsburgh Phantoms, San Jose Rhinos, and Tampa Bay Tritons.
Realignment.
With the larger RHI, for this season the league realigned its teams into two conferences, each with two divisions, each with six teams. Following what new National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman had done with the NHL's realignment, RHI new conferences and divisions were now geographically-named. Teams were placed into either the Eastern Conference, in the Atlantic Division or Central Division, or the Western Conference, in the Northwest Division or Pacific Division.
In addition, the playoff format was altered to resemble that of the pre–1993 NHL. Whereas the playoffs had previously been bracketed and seeded by league, they were now broken down by division and conference: the top four teams in each division were seeded one to four, with one playing four and two playing three, with the two winners playing in the division finals. Then the two division winners would play for the right to play for the Murphy Cup. The length of the playoff series were also expanded from a single elimination until the Murphy Cup Finals which was a best-of-three games, to best-of-three games in all series, with the third game being a one 12–minute period. Game one would be played at the lower seeded team's home arena, while games two and three would be played at the higher seeded team's home arena.
Season schedule.
RHI increased its regular season schedule from 14 to 22 games per team.
Regular season.
Divisional standings.
Western Conference.
Note: x – clinched playoff spot, y – clinched division title, z – clinched regular season conference title, b – clinched best overall record, e – eliminated from playoff contention
Tiebreaking procedures.
If two or more clubs are tied in points during the regular season, the ranking of the clubs is determined in the following order:
Playoffs.
Playoff seeds.
After the regular season, 16 teams qualified for the playoffs. The Minnesota Arctic Blast were the Eastern Conference regular season champions and had the best overall record at 37 points. The Los Angeles Blades had the best record in the Western Conference with 36 points.
Playoff bracket.
In the first two rounds, the highest seed in each division is matched against the lowest remaining seed, with the two division finals winners in each conference matched against each other in the conference finals. The higher-seeded team is awarded home floor advantage, which gives them a possible maximum of two games on their home floor, with the lower-seeded team getting one. In the Murphy Cup Finals, home floor is determined based on regular season points. Thus, the Buffalo Stampede had home floor advantage in the Murphy Cup Finals. Each best-of-three series, with the third game a one 12–minute period, followed a 1–2 format. This means that the lower-seeded team had home floor for game 1, while the higher-seeded team had home floor for game 2, and if necessary, the 12–minute period game 3.

The Little Mermaid (1968 film)

The Little Mermaid (, translit. Rusalochka) is a 1968 Russian animated feature based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale "The Little Mermaid".
Plot.
As the story opens, a busful of tourists are touring Copenhagen. Their guide draws their attention to the beautiful statue at Langelinie. At that, the film's focus moves below the waterline, where several fish tell the story of ...
A galleon is foundering on the rough ocean. Its master, a young prince, is trying his best to keep the ship out of harm, but he fails, and eventually falls into the waves. Meanwhile, four mermaid princesses come from a magnificent alabaster underwater palace. The three older mermaids, clad in blue, give their younger sister a red cloak, indirectly indicating who the protagonist is.
The little mermaid heads toward the surface and sees the now-unconscious prince in the water. She carries him to the shore, where she sings a sweet mermaid song for him. Then a bell tolls from a nearby convent and several women come out. The little mermaid jumps into the sea, waiting to see what becomes of the prince. One of the ladies finds the prince and helps him to the convent.
The little mermaid returns to her palace and tells her sisters of the prince. She decides to go to the hag of the sea for a solution. The hag offers her a potion to turn human, with the condition of having to lose her voice and bear a pain in her feet whilst walking. This the little mermaid quickly accepts. 
The little mermaid arrives on land, where she is met by the prince astride a horse. He sees her beauty, and she dreams of a fantasy world riding with him on a winged horse into the stars. The couple then are seen on a voyage on a ship to a nearby land. A servant from the nearby palace's balcony spots the ship and calls for the princess. The prince and the little mermaid enter the palace, observed by the courtiers. The king welcomes the couple. Then the king presents his daughter, who is none other than the girl at the convent. The little mermaid is surprised, remembering how the hag had told her that if the prince marries another, she (the mermaid) will die the very next sunrise. 
The prince and princess, clad in wedding clothes, head back to the ship with the little mermaid holding the bride's train and an entourage following them. As the little mermaid awaits the next day in desperation, her three sisters appear, now sporting short hair, since they traded their long tresses to the hag in exchange for enough magic to assist their younger sister. They give her a magic shell, which would kill the prince, save her life, and return her to her mermaid shape. The little mermaid refuses and drops the shell into the sea, then a huge wave comes to the ship, killing her for love. The prince notices her absence, and looks up in the sky as though he knows she is deceased and looking down upon him and his bride from a sunlit sky.

European route E 31 is an international Class-A road in Europe, part of the United Nations E-road network. It has a north-south reference.
It runs from Rotterdam, Netherlands to Ludwigshafen, Germany.
Firstly, it leaves Rotterdam, where it links to the E 19 and E 25 roads. It heads roughly east through the Netherlands, passing through Gorinchem (where it connects to the E 311), and Nijmegen before crossing the border into Germany.

Surgical Eye Expeditions International

Surgical Eye Expeditions (SEE) International is a nonprofit humanitarian organization based in Santa Barbara, California. Founded in 1974, SEE International connects volunteer ophthalmologists to host clinic sites worldwide to provide sight-restoring surgeries in communities that are overwhelmed with the large number of blind individuals who cannot afford surgery. The organization is currently headed by President/CEO Randal Avolio, along with a 12-member Board of Directors. In the United States, it is classified by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity.
Mission statement.
To provide medical, surgical and educational services by volunteer ophthalmic surgeons with the primary objective of restoring eyesight to disadvantaged blind individuals worldwide.
History.
Harry Brown, M.D., F.A.C.S. founded Surgical Eye Expeditions (SEE) International, Inc. in 1974. The inspiration for SEE was found in response to the overwhelming number of people worldwide living with surgically curable blindness, the majority of which is caused by cataracts.
During his fellowship in the early 1970s Dr. Brown worked with eye surgeons in Africa and Asia. Excited by the experience of healing people who traveled great distances for sight-restoring surgery, he first realized the need for a permanent vehicle to link volunteer professionals with disadvantaged blind persons throughout the developing world. Dr. Brown’s vision was realized in the founding of Surgical Eye Expeditions International, Inc. on August 26, 1974 with the help of Mr. William Crockett. Mr. Crockett was instrumental in the early years of SEE, serving as administrator for the first six years.
In the late 1980s the Santa Barbara Vision Care Program was created to reach low income and uninsured individuals in the Santa Barbara Community. Every year 300-600 vision screenings are conducted and 5 - 12 surgeries are facilitated for those in the local community who have no other means of obtaining such services.
Programs.
International.
In 2012 alone, SEE International performed 10,173 surgeries in 36 countries around the world. Over the course of 39 years SEE has screened approximately 3.2 million individuals, and completed over 400,000 surgeries in 75 different countries.
SEE expeditions are typically one week long. All teams are invited by the Ministry of Health or a local health authority from the host country. SEE’s international clinic coordinators work with the host ophthalmologists three to six months in advance to coordinate logistical details and to ensure the availability of proper facility, equipment, supplies, support and staff. 
The Need for Cataract Surgery.
SEE International’s primary focus of cataract surgery is one of the most cost-effective of all health interventions. Cataracts cause more than 48% of the world’s loss of sight and are surgically correctable. Except for the most developed countries, cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness in all regions of the world. With a 30-minute surgery and the patient under local anesthetic, a volunteer SEE surgeon can restore the sight of a person who has been blind with cataracts for 5, 10 or even 20 years.
Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (M/SICS).
Cataract surgeries in developing countries require a technique that is not normally practiced in the United States. Because of the density of the cataracts and the lack of infrastructure for sophisticated equipment, a manual process must be utilized in many developing countries. The extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) manual method is typically used, but involves a relatively large (usually 10–12 mm) incision made in the cornea which requires sutures. With the newer M/SICS procedure, a much smaller (5 mm) incision is made that is also self-sealing. Skilled surgeons can perform twice as many surgeries in the same amount of time with the M/SICS procedure compared to ECCE. In addition, patients typically have better post-op visual acuity, less astigmatism, fewer incidences of infection and heal faster through this process. 
As part of SEE International’s ongoing commitment to patient care and affiliate ophthalmologists, and because of all the benefits of Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery, SEE International has begun to train ophthalmologists in the technique through a one-day course held one to two times a year at the SEE offices in Santa Barbara.
Local.
SEE International formed the Santa Barbara Vision Care Program in response to the population within SEE’s own local community that could not afford vision care. The purpose of the Santa Barbara Vision Care Program is to save eyesight in patients through early detection and to provide sight-restoring surgery to those in need. In 2012, SBVCP provided services for 1,247 low-income and uninsured patients in Santa Barbara County. 2012 also marked the second year of providing Diabetic Retinopathy screenings for SBVCP patients.
Awards and recognition.
SEE has been awarded the Independent Charities of America (ICA) Seal of Excellence. The award is presented to nonprofit organizations that, upon independent review, have demonstrated the highest standards of public accountability, program effectiveness and cost effectiveness. 
In the December 10, 2001 issue of Forbes, SEE International was cited in the Charity Investment Guide for its 99% efficiency as a charity, meaning that financially almost nothing is lost to overhead.
Logo.
SEE International’s logo is based on the design of the rod of Aesculapius, the god of medicine and healing. Situated atop the staff is the symbol of an eye with the ideogram of the planet earth inside it, reflecting SEE International’s mission to provide sight-restoring surgeries worldwide.

Benjamin F. Potts

Benjamin Franklin Potts (January 29, 1836 – June 17, 1887) was a lawyer, politician, and soldier from the state of Ohio who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, as well as a postbellum Governor of the Montana Territory from 1870 to 1883. He commanded a brigade of infantry in the Western Theater in some of the war's most important campaigns and repeatedly received commendations for gallantry and tactical judgement in combat.
Early life and career.
Benjamin Potts was born on a farm in Fox Township, Carroll County, Ohio
, to James and Jane (Mapel) Potts. He attended the common schools. When he was seventeen, he began working as a clerk in a dry goods store in nearby Wattsville. He attended Westminster College in 1854–55, until he ran out of funding and returned to Ohio. He taught school and read law starting in September 1857 under Ephraim R. Eckley, later a U.S. Congressman. An active supporter of President James Buchanan, Potts was interested in local and national politics and joined the Democratic Party. 
In May 1859, he passed his bar exam in Canton, Ohio, and established a successful practice in Carrollton. He was a member of the Ohio delegation to the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, and supported the candidacy of Stephen A. Douglas.
Civil War.
With the outbreak of the Civil War, Potts was elected as a captain of the 32nd Ohio Infantry and mustered into the service on August 29, 1861. He served with the regiment in western Virginia and was present at Cheat Mountain and Greenbrier River. He was engaged in scouting with his company during a portion of the winter of 1861–62; and in 
the spring of 1862 he accompanied the regiment in the advance under Maj. Gen. Robert H. Milroy. Subsequently, he was engaged in the Battle of McDowell. He accompanied General John C. Frémont in his campaign up the Shenandoah Valley in pursuit of Stonewall Jackson, and was present at Cross Keys and Port Republic.
In July 1862, he was temporarily detached from his infantry company and assigned command of an artillery battery in Winchester, Virginia. During the Maryland Campaign, he and his men fell back to the presumed safety of Harpers Ferry, where they were part of the largest surrender of the U.S. Army until World War II, following the Battle of Harpers Ferry. Potts was paroled and sent to Camp Douglas until exchanged.
In December 1862, Potts was promoted to lieutenant colonel and commander of the demoralized and badly depleted 32nd Ohio. He reorganized the regiment, added substantially to its ranks, and refitted it for field duty. On Christmas Day, he was elevated to the colonelcy and then led the regiment in numerous campaigns of the Army of the Tennessee in the Western Theater, including the Siege of Vicksburg and the Atlanta Campaign. At Port Gibson he was complimented for gallantry by brigade commander Brig. Gen. John D. Stevenson; and at Raymond, Jackson, and Champion Hill, he received the thanks of Maj. Gen. John A. Logan. During the fight at Champion Hill, Colonel Potts charged with his regiment and captured an eight-gun Confederate battery and half of an Alabama infantry brigade that was guarding it.
In August Potts was assigned to the command of the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, XVII Corps, and he accompanied an expedition to Monroe, Louisiana. In November, Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson placed Potts in command of the 2nd Brigade. During Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's Meridian expedition, Potts led the advance of the XVII Corps across Baker's Creek, routed the Rebels under William Wirt Adams, and drove them into Jackson. Later, Potts commanded the forces that destroyed the railroad from Meridian. 
In 1864, Potts was assigned command of the 1st Brigade, 4th Division of the XVII Corps, and was distinguished during the Atlanta Campaign, especially in the Battle of Atlanta. Division commander Giles A. Smith wrote, "Colonel Potts did more, on the 22d of July, 1864, to save the good name of the Army of the Tennessee, than any other one man." That fall, he participated in the successful operations against Savannah, Georgia.
In January 1865, Potts was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers. He led his brigade during the Carolinas Campaign and in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C.. In May following the end of hostilities. Potts received the brevet rank of major general in the omnibus promotions at the end of the Civil War.
Postbellum career.
Potts mustered out of the army in January 1866 and returned to Carroll County, Ohio, where he resumed his legal and political careers. He changed political parties and joined the Republicans. A moderate, he was elected to the Ohio State Senate in 1867. Three years later, he accepted an appointment from a fellow Ohio politician and former general, President Ulysses S. Grant, as the governor of the Montana Territory, but only after first refusing it because the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in the Ohio Legislature depended upon his vote, which would be lost if he vacated his seat. Potts served until 1883. As governor, he was heavily involved in Indian affairs, as well as working to get several new frontier towns chartered, including Missoula. The bipartisan political stability Potts brought to Montana played an important role in the gradual lessening of vigilante activities and lawlessness in the territory. He later served in the territorial legistature.
Benjamin F. Potts died in 1887 in Helena, Montana, where he was buried initially in the Benton Avenue Cemetery. His remains were later moved to Forestvale Cemetery.

Perry (first name and dates unknown) was an English cricketer who played for Surrey during the 1750s. He was possibly related to the player called Perry who, in 1726, took part with Piper of Hampton in the earliest known single wicket contest.
Career.
The first mention of Perry is when he played for Surrey against Kent at Dartford Brent on Friday, 6 July 1750. Subsequently, he played in a single wicket match at the Artillery Ground on Monday, 10 September 1745, for Tom Faulkner's Five against Stephen Dingate's Five.
He then played for All-England against Kent in the two matches at the Artillery Ground in May 1751. On Monday, 3 June 1751, Perry played in a "fives" match for Kent against Surrey. He must have been adept at single wicket as he was involved in further contests in 1754 and 1755.
The only other mention of him was in 1752 when he was a given man playing for Westminster against Addington.
As Perry had established his reputation by 1750, he must have been active for some years previously. His career probably spanned the 1740s and 1750s when very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports.

Shuotherium

Shuotherium is a fossil relative of the monotremes known from Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) layers of the Forest Marble Formation, England, and from Middle-Late Jurassic layers of the Shaximiao Formation of Sichuan, China.
The original holotype is composed of a partial dentary and seven teeth (two which are incomplete). The holotypes for other species of this genus are solely represented by isolated molars. "Shuotherium", along with "Pseudotribos" has been placed in the Order Shuotheridia, Family Shuotheriidae as a sister taxon of the Australosphenida (see, Yinotheria).
Description.
In it lower molars, the talonid is situated in front of the trigonid, such a unique dental form is distinct from the typical tribosphenic pattern. In this "pseudotribosphenic" trait, the mesial cingulid is expanded to form a pseudotalonid, and its distal talonid is underdeveloped. It shares with Australosphenida a thin, slender dentary but differs from the non-monotreme Ausktribosphenida by having more developed postdentary trough. Its dental formula has been reconstructed as: <p4, m3.

Mike Naumenko

Mike Naumenko (, born Mikhail Vasilyevich Naumenko, 18 April 1955 – 30 August 1991) was a Soviet rock and blues-rock musician, singer-songwriter, the leader of Zoopark rock group. 
Born in Leningrad, in the 1970s he was a member of the Russian rock group Akvarium, and in 1981 he formed Zoopark, which became one of the most outstanding blues rock groups of USSR. Naumenko is considered one of the best lyricists of Russian rock, although drawing heavily on Bob Dylan and other UK/US songwriters, and occasionally retaining the original melody as well. Some of Naumenko's songs are more or less faithful translations or remakes of English language source material (the notions of copyright and plagiarism being hardly established in the Soviet Union, especially as regards works created on the other side of the Iron Curtain). Largely imitative, Naumenko's input was yet very significant as he adapted the Western rock tradition to Russian culture and the urban realities of Leningrad.
Early years.
Naumenko studied at a "school with an intensive English-language program" in Leningrad, where he got his stage name, "Mike".
The first time he got interested in music was at the age of eight when he had heard music by the Beatles playing from the street, standing on his balcony. The first he took an interest in were the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Jefferson Airplane; besides he collected articles from magazines concerning T. Rex, the Doors and David Bowie. At the age of 15, he started playing guitar and writing his first songs. His song lyrics were in English first, but in 1972-1973 he switched to Russian under the influence of his friend, Boris Grebenshikov.
Naumenko's lyrical muse has been identified as the Leningrad artist Tatyana Apraksina, as reflected in songs such as "Sweet N," "If It Rains," "Your River's Blues" and "Morning for Two". According to Naumenko, in a late interview, "All my songs are dedicated to her."
Legacy.
Naumenko died in Leningrad in August 1991, at the age of 36. His memory has been honored with numerous tribute albums (see Discography below) and in other creative works including a 2009 novel and an "blues opera" that premiered in 2011. A collection of Naumenko's complete writings — including his samizdat translation of Richard Bach's "Illusions" — is being prepared for publication in 2015.

Anastasia Dimitrova

Anastasia Dimitrova () (12 May 1815 – 1894) was the first Bulgarian female teacher of the National Revival period. In 1840, she established in her native city of Pleven the first girls' school in the Bulgarian lands.
Dimitrova was born in Pleven on 12 May 1815 to poor Bulgarian parents: her mother was a servant in Agapius, the bishop of Vratsa's home. She began her education with the bishop's mother. In 1836–1839, she continued to study in the Kalofer nunnery, not only with the nuns, but also with well-known teachers such as Rayno Popovich and Botyo Petkov. She studied history, geography, arithmetic and grammar.
In October 1840, she founded a secular girls' school based on the Bell-Lancaster method in her native Pleven. The school was sponsored by Bishop Agapius and employed Church Slavonic books; besides Bulgarian, the girls were also taught Greek. Although her educational activities suffered a short interruption, she continued her work in 1842. By 1845, the Pleven school was visited by 90 girls from Pleven, Lovech, Troyan, Tarnovo, Vratsa and other cities. Some of Dimitrova's former pupils founded schools in their respective hometowns.
Upon marrying in 1852, Dimitrova left the school but continued to work as a private tutor to around 10 girls, along with her former student Mita Gegova. A devout Christian, Dimitrova visited Jerusalem in 1894, became a nun under the religious name Anna and died shortly thereafter in the Holy Land.

Knucklehead (band)

Knucklehead is a Canadian punk rock group formed in Calgary, Alberta in 1994. Influenced by such punk groups as Bad Religion, Stiff Little Fingers, Cocksparrer, Billy Bragg and Social Distortion, Knucklehead is uses fast tempo rhythms and chant choruses. Knucklehead uses socio-political themes in a number of their songs.
History.
Knucklehead played their first show in 1995 at The Night Gallery in Calgary, Alberta and their recording history started almost as soon as the band was formed. They recorded their first demo tape in early 1994, and in 1995 released a 10" EP "Ode to the Old Reliables". In 1996 their first full length studio album "Another Neurotic Episode" was released on the independent Calgary based label Melodiya Records. In 1997 the band released a 7" white vinyl single on Sloth records (Calgary) called "When The Music Hits". It was part of the "Ship and Anchor Cocktail series", a string of 7" records that were themed as drinks (Knuckleheads was a white Russian). After touring eastern Canada and the United States, the band was picked up by Florida based label Far Out Records and released a self-titled 7" and their second full length studio album "Little Boots" in 1998. Knucklehead toured extensively across Canada and the United States in this period. 
After the collapse of Far Out Records and the addition of a new drummer, Knucklehead began the recording of their 2001 release "Voice Among Us" on their own label, Whiskey Voice Records. The album was later licensed to Longshot Music and Belgium's Ghetto Rock Records for re-release in North America and Europe. In 2003 the band released their CD/EP "Hostage Radio" which contained a video for the song "Plight of the Living Dead". This video received numerous requests and air time on Canada's Much Music program "The Punk Show". The band got a new guitarist and drummer in 2003, and with the new members they recorded a cover of the Stompin' Tom Connors classic "Canadian Lumberjack" for the Tom Connors tribute CD "Bring Your Own Plywood". Knucklehead released another 7" in 2004 on Longshot Music entitled "Cosmetic Youth". Knucklehead released their fourth full length studio album "The New Black List" on Stumble Records in 2005. The end of 2008 saw Knucklehead release another 7" on Longshot Music, this time a split with some friends from Toronto called Hostage Life.
Their 2010 full length "Hearts on fire" was released again on Stumble records with the LP version coming out a year later on Longshot.
In 2013 the guys released a 7" on Pirates Press records.
Members.
From their first show in 1995, Knucklehead has been kept together by its founding three members. Originally a three piece band composed of Clayton MacNeill on guitar, Matt Young on Bass and Kyle Hegel on drums and vocals. The band remained this way up until 1999, when Casie Lewis took over drumming duty until Kris Lesak was recruited as the new drummer for the band. This allowed Kyle to focus primarily on vocals. The look of the group changed again in 2003 when the group added another guitarist named James Gamble and replaced drummer Kris Lesak with Eric Jablonski.

<doc id="19821042" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19821042" title="Technical lettering">
Technical lettering

Technical lettering is the process of forming letters, numerals, and other characters in technical drawing. It is used to describe, or provide detailed specifications for, an object. With the goals of legibility and uniformity, styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability. Engineering drawings use a Gothic sans-serif script, formed by a series of short strokes. Lower case letters are rare in most drawings of machines.
Freehand lettering.
The letters to be drawn, though freehanded, should be stable and graceful. In some cases stability is impossible; for example, "P" and "F" are unavoidably top-heavy. In other cases the stability and grace of the letters may be maintained either by drawing the lower parts of the letters like "B","E" etc. wider than the upper parts, or by drawing the horizontal line at the center of these letters just above their geometric axis. (Exception: In case of the letter "A", the horizontal member is drawn below the geometric center, to maintain "equality of areas below and above the center line". If a horizontal line is drawn exactly at the center, then the difference in the areas of the triangle above the line and the trapezium below the line is much larger. This creates an unusual effect to our eyes.)
Emphasis should be on the overall beauty of a word, rather than individual letters.
Most freehand lettering is done in a "gothic" style, i.e., with a constant line thickness; either "straight gothic", with vertical strokes perpendicular to the baseline, or "inclined gothic", with vertical strokes at about 75°.
Mechanical lettering.
Mechanical lettering is sometimes done using a pantograph, a device consisting of four bars ("links") which are pinned to each other to form a parallelogram. The links can pivot about these pins. The lowermost link of the parallelogram is fixed to two rigid supports. One vertical link at one end is connected to a profile tracer, which traces the profile of the letter to be drawn, and the second vertical link and the other horizontal link are jointly connected to a pencil that draws the exact shape of the profile traced.

Biography.
She received her MFA from Yale in 2001. She is represented by DCKT Contemporary in New York where she had solo exhibitions in 2008 and 2006. She has also exhibited at Frederic Snitzer Gallery (Miami, FL), La Montagne Gallery (Boston, MA), 101 California Street Gallery, (San Francisco, CA), and Sandroni Rey Gallery (Los Angeles, CA). Her work was included in a traveling group exhibition “Space is the Place” which was curated by Alex Baker and Tony Kamps for Independent Curators International. The exhibition has been shown at the Hudson River Museum (Yonkers, NY), The Contemporary Arts Center (Cincinnati, OH) as well as others across the United States.
Dark Skate.
For the "Dark Skate" series, which began in 2008, Halloran photographed herself while skateboarding in the dark, save a light attached to her, creating self-portraits where her movement abstracts her presence. The relatively long exposure time of each photograph, sometimes up to 7 minutes, would allow the light that was attached to the artist to illuminate the background of the image. At the moment the series includes "Dark Skate" Los Angeles, "Dark Skate/Miami", and "Dark Skate/Detroit". A forthcoming series will be set in the Bay Area.
The Only Way Out Is Through.
"The Only Way Out Is Through" is a series of paintings made in 2009-2010 that were inspired by the Cuevas de los Cristales in Naica, Mexico. The large scale paintings, such as "The Only Way Out Is Through" (left) explore liminality and relationships. The Naica mine, where the crystals reach lengths of 60 feet, are inaccessible to most people as the conditions are extreme. Temperatures reach up to 120F and protective gear is required. To create these large scale paintings of the crystals Halloran worked from a variety of photographs in the media as well as from scientific drawings. In some of the smaller paintings there are figures perched on the crystals to demonstrate their scale.

Buckingham (unit)

The Buckingham (symbol: B) is a CGS unit of electric quadrupole, named in honour of the chemical physicist A. David Buckingham who was the first to measure a molecular quadrupole moment. It is defined as 1 statcoulomb-centimetre2. This is equivalent to 1 Debye-Angstrom, where 1 Debye = 1 statcoulomb-centimetre is the cgs unit of molecular dipole moment and 1 Angstrom = 1 cm. 
One Buckingham corresponds to the quadrupole moment resulting from two opposing dipole moments but an equal magnitude of 1 Debye which are separated by a distance of 1 Angstrom, a typical bond length. This is analogous to the Debye unit for the dipole moment of two opposing charges of 1 statcoulomb separated by 1 Angstrom, and the name Buckingham for the unit was in fact suggested by Peter Debye in 1963 in honour of Buckingham.

Woodpigeon (band)

Woodpigeon are an independent rock collective originally founded in Calgary, Alberta, led by and performing the songs of Mark Andrew Hamilton. To date, Woodpigeon have released four studio albums, and a number of EPs to critical acclaim, and Hamilton has worked with over 70 collaborators both on record and in live performance. Live, Woodpigeon is often a solo project incorporating loops and layered vocals.
When asked about the band's name, Hamilton explains: "I've always been in love with the word Woodpigeon for as long as I can remember. When you write it in cursive, it looks like a rollercoaster".
The band's sound has been compared to Sufjan Stevens, Grizzly Bear, Camera Obscura, Simon & Garfunkel, and Belle & Sebastian, amongst others. Band leader Mark Hamilton's main lyrical influence is The Kinks.
Career.
Woodpigeon's origins are found with primary song-writer Mark Andrew Hamilton writing songs in Edinburgh, Scotland. At this time, the band was named Woodpigeon Divided By Antelope Equals Squirrel and consisted of Hamilton alongside Steve Kaye and Malcolm Benzie (who went on to form Edinburgh slowcore band eagleowl). Hamilton states that he "was far too scared to ever sing, so all we ever played was a couple of stupid instrumentals and our only “performance” was in the streets of Edinburgh." Eventually, Hamilton returned to Canada, and started afresh, with the shortened band name, Woodpigeon. Other band members fell in place, with Hamilton noting that: "the way it came together was simple: friends started hearing my songs and offering their services."
The band's first full-length album, entitled "Songbook", was released in late 2006. Following its release, the band opened for Broken Social Scene, Iron and Wine, Grizzly Bear, and Calexico. With their popularity growing, Woodpigeon toured the UK, Ireland, and Germany in 2008. That October they performed a pair of "Homecoming" shows in Calgary and Edmonton as an opener for Iron and Wine.
The band self-released an album, "Treasury Library Canada", in early August 2008, selling all 1,000 hand-folded copies within a few weeks. The band also re-released their debut album "Songbook" in the UK on September 29, 2008. "Treasury Library Canada" was officially re-released in February 2009 as a double album with the ukulele-based "Houndstooth Europa" collection as "Treasury Library Canada c/w Houndstooth Europa", and was long-listed for the 2009 Polaris Prize. Woodpigeon performed alongside acts as varied as The Constantines, Plants & Animals, Mount Eerie and Grizzly Bear, and Hamilton served as the curator of the first annual Sled Island Festival in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
The band's third album, "Die Stadt Muzikanten", was released on January 12, 2010, with Hamilton stating that it is "simultaneously a lot bigger, and a lot smaller. There’s definitely some big surprises on it". A limited Record Store Day release of the album was accompanied with a bonus LP titled "BALLADEER/to all the guys i've loved before", featuring songs recorded with producers Steve Albini, Howard Bilerman, and Husky Huskolds, and a duet with Beth Jeans Houghton. The record was subsequently re-released as a stand-alone album on limited edition vinyl. Woodpigeon has since toured extensively both as a headliner and as opener for Andrew Bird, Horse Feathers, Jose Gonzalez and Junip, and also appeared at the 2011 Meltdown Festival curated by Ray Davies on the Bandstand Busking stage. The same year they played as part of the Canadian Blast showcase for Canadian bands at London's prestigious Barbican, garnering good reviews.
In an interview with "Xtra!" in early 2010, Hamilton spoke in part about how his identity as a gay man influences his songwriting.
In 2011, Hamilton participated in the National Parks Project, collaborating with musicians Laura Barrett and Cadence Weapon and filmmaker Peter Lynch, to produce and score a short film about Alberta's Waterton Lakes National Park. The "Fra Le Nuvole" EP was released later in 2011, collecting together two EP-length singles released from "Die Stadt Muzikanten". 2011 also saw Woodpigeon's first national tour of Canada, alongside The Phonemes and The Mountains & The Trees. Transportation for the tour was completed via rail, including special performances on the trains themselves.
The "For Paolo" EP followed in January 2012, marking Hamilton's move to Vienna, Austria, followed that September by "Diamonds", an album-length collection of outtakes available only online and at live shows, featuring a duet cover of Paul McCartney's Michael Jackson duet Say Say Say. Following a year of touring alongside Junip, Andrew Bird, and Patrick Wolf, Woodpigeon appeared at the 2012 Iceland Airwaves Festival in Reykjavik.
Woodpigeon have since signed to London-based Fierce Panda Records for the 2013 release of "Thumbtacks + Glue". The album is to be accompanied by two adjacent single releases: "Edinburgh" featuring B-side "Little Magnet" and "Red Rover, Red Rover" featuring B-side "Sofia + Sam". The "Edinburgh" video features appearances by noted Edinburgh musicians eagleowl, Rob St. John and Withered Hand.
Hamilton began 2013 with a self-curated Reykjavik-Calgary Musicians Exchange Project as part of Calgary's High Performance Rodeo. The assembled group of six musicians, featuring Reykjavik's Benni Hemm Hemm and Prins Póló alongside Calgarians Clinton St. John, Samantha Savage Smith and Laura Leif, wrote an album's worth of music in Iceland which was then presented at the 2013 Rodeo at Calgary's Festival Hall. The album was subsequently recorded at The Banff Centre by producer Graham Lessard, with plans to release in 2014.

Henry Courtney Selous

Henry Courtney Selous (b.Panton Street, Haymarket, London 1803; d.Beaworthy, Devon, 24 September 1890), was an English painter, illustrator and lithographer. He was the son of Gideon "George" Slous (1777–1839), a Flemish portrait and miniature painter, and a pupil of John Martin who was an important and influential English painter of the 19th century. He was an occupant of Keats House in Hampstead, from 1835 to 1838. Selous had two brothers, Frederick Lokes Slous (the father of Frederick Courteney Selous) and Angiolo Robson Slous, a playwright who wrote "True to the Core: A Story of the Armada" and whose daughter Alice married the novelist Morley Roberts. 
In 1818 Selous entered the Royal Academy Schools and also exhibited his first work, a "Portrait of a Favourite Cat", location untraced, at the Academy. He submitted animal portraits for the next three years before embarking on human portraiture. His early works were exhibited under the name "Slous", but at sometime between 1831 and 1838 he adopted the name "Selous".
In the 1840s he began to paint historical subjects, initially inspired by the renewed interest in history painting prompted by the New Palace of Westminster cartoon competition for the designs of frescoes on the new building in 1843. In this he submitted a picture of "Boadicea Harranguing the Iceni" which won a premium of £200 in 1843. He was aided by the knowledge of mural technique he had acquired by working for a panorama painter. Despite the prize, the picture was criticised by one reviewer because the "violence of the action and dashing lights carry us away like the speech of a mob orator." 
He painted historical pieces for the rest of his career, for example "Cassio Wounded", 1874, location untraced, as well as such works as "The Opening of The Great Exhibition" (see works, below) recording contemporary events.
Personal life.
ON 4 March 1837 he married, Emily Elizabeth (d. 1879), daughter of the successful miniature painter Henry Pierce Boneat at St Pancras Parish Church and they had four daughters.

Colexicographical order

In mathematics, the colexicographic or colex order, is a natural order structure of the Cartesian product of two or more ordered sets. It is similar in structure to the lexicographical order. Colexicographical ordering is used in the Kruskal-Katona theorem.
Given two partially ordered sets "A" and "B", the colexicographical order on the Cartesian product "A" × "B" is defined as
The result is a partial order. If "A" and "B" are totally ordered, then the result is a total order also.
More generally, one can define the colexicographic order on the Cartesian product of "n" ordered sets.
Suppose

List of St. Louis Archdiocesan Auxiliary Bishops

The following is the List of Saint Louis Bishops. The Roman Catholic Church in the United States, informally known as the American Catholic Church, comprises 195 dioceses led by residential bishops. Auxiliary bishops serve in association with the residential bishops in larger dioceses. Dioceses led by archbishops are called archdioceses. There are thirty-two archbishops who serve as metropolitan bishops of their respective ecclesiastical provinces. As of March 2007, nine of these metropolitans have been designated Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church.
In addition to the 195 dioceses, there are several other dioceses in the nation's overseas dependencies. There are also dioceses and eparchies of the Eastern Catholic Churches. A special archdiocese was created by the Vatican for the United States military. Such bodies are also organized into metropolitan provinces of their own.
All bishops in the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands, residential and auxiliary, are members of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Bishops in Puerto Rico form their own episcopal conference. Those from insular areas in the Pacific Ocean are members of the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific.

Frank Williams (rugby union)

Frank L Williams (26 January 1910 – 7 July 1959) was a Welsh international rugby union centre for Wales who played club rugby for Cardiff, Wakefield and Headingley. Williams was a solid defensive player, who not only tackled well but was also unafraid to cover a grounded ball and accepted the punishment meted out.
Rugby career.
Williams was first selected for Wales on 2 February 1929 in a game against Scotland at St Helens. Wales won 14-7, ending a run of four consecutive home defeats to Scotland. Williams was reselected in Wales's next two games, a victory over France and a trip to Ireland for the final game of the 1929 Championship. Williams was among the majority of the Welsh players to wake up feeling ill on the morning of the Ireland game, with only tee-totalers Morley and Peacock unaffected. Ireland took an early lead in a brutal, defensive encounter. Williams managed to break through the Irish defence to score his first international try, which Dai Parker converted to give Wales a draw.
In 1929 Williams was appointed as the sports master of Wakefield Grammar School in Yorkshire, and played the rest of his club career in Yorkshire, playing club rugby for Wakefield and Headingley and county rugby for the Yorkshire XV. Williams continued to represent Wales, turning out for all four matches in the 1930 Five Nations Championship, in which Wales finished second, losing to Scotland and England and beating Ireland and France. In the same year Williams was offered a position in the 1930 British Lions tour, but turned down the invitation.
Williams was back in the Wales squad for the 1931 Championship, though he missed the first two games against England and Scotland. In the match against France he linked up with Claude Davey and Dicky Ralph to form a strong midfield triangle which overran the French. Wales scored seven tries, with Williams scoring his second try for his country. In the final match of the tournament Wales beat Ireland 15-3 and won the Five Nations Championship.
At the end of the 1930/31 season, Williams was chosen to tour south Wales with the Barbarians. It was a very successful set of matches for the invitational Baa-Baas, winning all their matches in south Wales for the first time. At the end of 1931, the touring South Africans arrived in Britain and Williams faced them twice. Williams was on the losing side twice, firstly for Wales in December, and then as part of a joint Yorkshire/Cumberland team in January the next year.

Darke County Courthouse, Sheriff's House and Jail

The Darke County Courthouse, Sheriff's House and Jail are three historic buildings located at 504 South Broadway just south of West 4th Street in Greenville, Ohio. On December 12, 1976, the three buildings of the present courthouse complex were added to the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
Darke County was formed in 1809 from parts of Miami County but was not formally organized until 1817. The county seat was placed at Greenville at the site of the old Fort Greenville on West Third Street. The first courthouse was built in 1824 and was a small wooden frame structure. The courts met on the first floor with the clerk's office a jury room on the second. The county remained at this location untilthe next courthouse was completed in 1834. This older courthouse was converted into a residence after this move.
The courthouse of 1834 was placed in the public square and was designed by architect Allan LaMotte. This square building stood two-stories tall with a hipped roof and a cupola rising from the center. This building was deemed to be too small for the county's needs and a new courthouse was planned. This old courthouse would serve as the town hall until it was removed to avoid any potential traffic hazards.
The new courthouse was built in 1874 and was designed by Edwin May. The contracting bids went to Rouser & Rouser from Dayton. The sheriff's house and jail were built in 1870 on the same grounds as the courthouse and served in their roles until a new center was built. Today the sheriff's house is the Courthouse Annex while the old jail behind is used for storage of records and other county items.
Courthouse.
The courthouse is designed in the Second Empire style with traces of Italianate style. The rectangular building is lined with Buena Vista sandstone with a rusticated foundation and smooth stones lining the floors above. The windows were designed as arches until long rectangular panels were placed during the renovation. Above each window is a decorative head casing in the shape of an arch or pediment. A central projection on the front facade is topped by a tower. The tower contains the main entrance with pilasters on either side holding a balcony. A pediment rests at the top floor and is surmounted by a statue of Justice. The tower rises to a dome which is capped by a spire. Four stone chimneys line the sides of the courthouse. The flat roof was once a mansard and is supported by a decorative entablature.
Sheriff's House and Jail.
The sheriff's residence and the jail located beside the courthouse were built in 1870. The building is designed in the Italianate style. A central projection is flanked by a pair of windows on each floor with quoin edges on the projection and the building's corners. A cornice runs below the roof with geometric shapes including an ellipse, square and oval. The roof overhang contains brackets with three scroll grooves and supports the hipped roof. A pedimet rests on the projection and contains an unadorned tympanum.

George Bruce of Carnock

Sir George Bruce of Carnock (c. 1550 – 1625) was a Scottish merchant and engineer. He was born in Carnock, near Dunfermline.
Coal mining.
Bruce was an innovator in coal mining techniques, introducing undersea mining into the Upper Hirst seam with use of new drainage technology. These innovations attracted much interest, including a visit from King James VI in 1617. Sir George Bruce invited him to visit one of his mines which tunnelled down beneath the sea bed. James ventured into the tunnel which went far out into the Firth of Forth and found himself at a shaft point where the coal was loaded onto the ships. Alarmed to find himself surrounded by water at the top of the shaft, James accused Sir George of an attempt on his life and declared that the whole affair was an act of treason. It was only when George Bruce pointed out the rowing boat and explained that one could either use that or return by the tunnel from whence they came that James relaxed again - and took the option of the boat journey.
Culross Palace.
Between 1597 and 1611, Bruce built a mansion house in Culross, using materials from his foreign trading. This building has subsequently become known as Culross Palace. He lavishly decorated the palace and the stunning painted ceilings, ornate features and panelling can still be seen. Culross Palace is now under the care of the National Trust for Scotland and has been restored to its 17th-century splendour. The palace building, which had faded to a white wash has been restored to its original yellow-orange exterior. The courtyard path and the garden have also been remodelled, with the garden now full of vegetables, herbs and plants, growing as they would have done in the 17th century.
Death.
Bruce died on 6 May 1625 and was buried in Culross Abbey.

Basque ring rosary

A Basque ring rosary (in Basque : Euskal arrosarioa) is a typical Basque rosary. 
Traditional Basque rosary.
The rosary is a circular wooden piece, 4 cm in diameter with a hole in the middle to introduce a finger. 
Like all rosaries, its aim is to enable a faithful of the Catholic religion to count the number of recited prayers.
At the top is a cross (typically with 4 branches of the same size) symbolizing the prayer Our Father. On the periphery, 10 small spheres equally distributed symbolize the Hail Mary. 
The user places a finger in the opening at the center and puts his thumb on the cross at the top. He recites an Our Father, then moves his thumb onto the first small sphere. He recites as many Hail Maries as he wishes, advancing one bead after each prayer.
Basque rosary in jewelry.
The Basque rosary is a simple piece of jewelry, gold or silver, 1 to 4 cm diameter. Worn with a little chain around the neck. 
The central opening is then often replaced by a little figure like the Basque cross "Lauburu". 
It is sometimes adorned with a slogan such as "Ongi ene gogoa" (= "good [is my wish/mind"). 
Other ring rosaries.
Other cultures use ring rosaries. Specially in case of religious persecutions against Catholic people. These rosaries are small and can be hidden in clothes. An example is the Irish penal rosary also with 10 beads.
However, they also were worn for protection and adornment at times when Catholicism was not persecuted, as it would be more difficult to break or wear-down a rosary ring, rather than a traditional rosary threaded onto a string.

List of St. Louis bishops

The following is the List of Saint Louis Bishops. The Roman Catholic Church in the United States comprises 195 dioceses led by residential bishops. Auxiliary bishops serve in association with the residential bishops in larger dioceses. There are thirty-two ecclesiastical provinces, each headed by a metropolitan archbishop, of which the Archbishop of Saint Louis is one. As of November 2010, five of the metropolitan archbishops of this see have been designated cardinals: John Joseph Glennon (1946), Joseph Ritter (1961), John Carberry (1969) Justin Francis Rigali (2003), and Raymond Leo Burke (2010).
In addition to the 195 dioceses, there are several other dioceses in the nation's overseas dependencies. There are also dioceses and eparchies of the Eastern Catholic Churches. A special archdiocese was created by the Vatican for the United States military. Such bodies are also organized into metropolitan provinces of their own.
All bishops in the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands, residential and auxiliary, are members of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Bishops in Puerto Rico form their own episcopal conference. Those from insular areas in the Pacific Ocean are members of the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific.

1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France

The 1982 Kangaroo tour was the fifteenth Kangaroo tour where the Australian national rugby league team plays a number of matches against British and French rugby league teams, in additions to the Test matches. The Australia national rugby league team have generally since 1908 barring wartime, toured Great Britain every four years often capping the tour with games and Tests in France. This regular touring side (and in recent years all Australian representative sides) are known as the Kangaroos.
The 1982 Kangaroos, coached by Frank Stanton, dominated, winning both Test series against Great Britain (three Tests) and France (2 Tests), going through the entire tour undefeated and earning the nickname The Invincibles. This was the first ever Kangaroo touring side to win every game of the tour. They won 22 matches of 22 played scoring 1,005 points for 120 against, an average of 45.6 points scored per game while only conceding 5.4 points per game. The twenty-eight player squad was captained by Max Krilich, with Wally Lewis his deputy. The next Kangaroo Tour was staged in 1986.
Touring party.
The team was coached by the tough and single-minded Frank Stanton who demanded great discipline and focus from his sides and who was making his third tour - the second as coach. Manly-Warringah's Max Krilich was captain and carried out his duties coolly and with great application. Wally Lewis deputised as vice-captain.
Interviewed by Whiticker in 2004 Krilich said about the talented squad; "The players in that squad were yet to reach their full potential. We were criticised as a weak side, but nobody knew how great a player Wayne Pearce was going to be on the tour. Wally Lewis was still in his early 20s and many of the Queenslanders were in the early stages of their careers". He also spoke of Stanton (who was his Manly-Warringah club coach when he had won the 1976 and 1978 NSWRFL premierships): "Frank was a mentally tough coach who totally believed in what he told his players. Great credit must go to Stanton who played down the accomplishment and kept our heads straight." 
While the pair did not enjoy an easy relationship, mostly due to Stanton not being impressed with his attitude to training or habits on tour which actually caused him to put on weight, Wally Lewis also found respect for Stanton. After missing selection for the first test in Hull, Stanton challenged Lewis to get back into shape and win his way back into the test team, something he achieved with selection on the bench for the second test in Wigan.
Six players from the 1982 premiership winning Parramatta Eels were selected in the squad, a new record for one club.
Tour managers were the Newtown administrator Frank Farrington and Queenslander, T Drysdale. "Open Rugby" magazine claimed the Australians had brought "a new dimension of excitement and adventure" to the game and former England great Alex Murphy called then "men from another planet."
This was the first Kangaroo tour since the introduction of State of Origin and it allowed Queensland to reverse New South Wales' dominance in interstate football, with a record-equaling eleven Queenslanders selected for the tour.
Future Kangaroos captain Mal Meninga, making the first of his record four Kangaroo Tours, was the leading point scorer on tour with 166 from 10 tries and 68 goals, including 48 points in the three tests against Great Britain (2 tries, 21 goals), and 17 points in the two tests against France (1 try, 7 goals). John Ribot was the leading try scorer on tour with 25 from just 14 games, including a try in the 3rd test against Great Britain. Ribot added 20 goals to his points tally to join Meninga as the only players on tour to score over 100 points.
By club.
The touring side was represented by 17 New South Welshmen and 11 Queenslanders (Q).
Great Britain.
Before flying to England, half the squad, led by Kangaroos vice-captain Wally Lewis, went to Perth to play Western Australia, while the other half, along with coach Stanton, travelled to Papua New Guinea for a test match against the Kumuls, won 38-2 by the Kangaroos. Nine of the players who traveled to PNG with Stanton would go on to play in the first test against Great Britain. Those who played against PNG but were overlooked for the first test of The Ashes were John Ribot (replaced by Eric Grothe), Steve Mortimer (Peter Sterling), Rohan Hancock (Les Boyd) and John Muggleton (Wayne Pearce).
Once on English soil controversy surfaced when the incumbent Australian Test halves Steve Mortimer and Wally Lewis were not chosen for the opening match. Instead, Parramatta's Grand Final winning halves Peter Sterling and Brett Kenny took the field against Hull Kingston Rovers and, playing alongside nine of the eventual first test team, set about locking up their positions for the first Test on 30 October.
Leading up to the first test at Hull, The Kangaroos also played a non-test 'international' against Wales in Cardiff on 24 October. In a match played in heavy rain in front of 5,617 fans, Australia, captained by Wally Lewis, ran in nine tries to one in a 37-7 rout. The game marked the first time Lewis, who would take over the test captaincy in 1984, captained Australia in a game against another country.
The Ashes series.
While Australia's side for the opening Test was built around the new breed of young players such as Eric Grothe, Wayne Pearce, Mal Meninga, Brett Kenny and Peter Sterling mixing with veterans Ray Price, Rod Reddy and Steve Rogers and captain Max Krilich, Great Britain chose five players aged over 30. The only player over the age of 30 for the Kangaroos first test team was Krilich who had turned 33 only five days prior to the test.
Great Britain did well in the first half to trail by only 4-10 at half time. In the second half however, the Kangaroos unleashed their skills and fitness, and blazed six stunning tries to leave the British game, and most of the 26,771 strong crowd at Hull's Boothferry Park stunned. The game was Australia's 4th straight win over Great Britain, dating back to the final test of the 1978 Kangaroo Tour and the 3-0 whitewash of the Lions on their lackluster 1979 Australasian tour.
Despite ten changes to the Lions' side, with only winger Des Drummond and props Trevor Skerrett and Jeff Grayshon, who also took over the captaincy, retained from the first test thrashing, the second Test was scarcely a contest and the Kangaroos won by 27-6. Australia's fiery forward Les Boyd was sent off late in the first half for kicking a tackled player on the ground (the touch judge only seeing Boyd's kick which was in reaction to the tackled Lions player lashing out with a boot at Boyd), and the Kangaroos played out the remaining 46 minutes with only twelve men. Eric Grothe suffered a knee injury while scoring a try late in the first half and was replaced at half time by Wally Lewis. The injury would see Grothe miss the third test, played only a week later in Leeds.
The third Test was well contested until the final ten minutes with Widnes halfback Andy Gregory and Bradford Northern hooker Brian Noble, playing his first test, leading the way for the Lions and providing the service to their speedy outside backs that Britain had lacked in the first two tests. Indeed, the Lions made more line breaks in the third test at Headingley than they had in the previous two tests. With just over 10 minutes left to play the Aussies were holding-off Britain by 14-8 and an intense finish loomed after Hull winger Steve Evans scored the Lions only try of the series. It seemed Britain had not been so far behind Australia's standard after all, but in the final 10 minutes the Kangaroos ripped the home side apart with 4 tries to run out win 32-8 winners and become the first touring side to go through Britain undefeated.
Right on half time there was a set-to between forwards Les Boyd and Mick Crane which resulted in an all-in brawl. As the teams lined up for the second half, French referee Julian Rascagneres called out both Boyd and Crane and sent both to the sin-bin for 10 minutes.
The Ashes series win was Australia's 4th straight over the Lions dating back to 1974, and their second straight 3-0 series win. It also continued the streak started by the 1963-64 Kangaroos of successfully defending The Ashes in England.

The Famines (band)

The Famines are a Canadian indie rock band formed in 2008 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The two piece band uses a modern and minimalistic approach that draws comparison to mid 1970's protopunk and fuzzy garage rock.
History.
The Famines band name is meant to be a commentary on the continued feeling of emptiness and lacking in a society that is materially fulfilled. The Famines toyed around with the idea of recording together since 2006, but a busy schedule, including marriages and tryouts with other bands kept the duo from producing anything until the summer of 2008.
The band also wanted to take their time recording, choosing not to “practice” the songs in front of live audiences, and only played their first show after their first release on July 18, 2008 at Edmonton’s Pawn Shop. They have since started a second tour across western Canada in support of their release. The Famines’ debut EP consists of four songs on double seven inch vinyl put out independently. The EP was also available on cassette and eight-track, as well as online through multiple music sites, with the help of Put Out The Jams Distro and Pop Echo. Conspicuously missing is a CD version of the EP. Accompanying the EP is a 26 page bound booklet of art by Biesinger. The booklet, as well as a 30 page second addition, titled A Visual History of the Famines is available for purchase separate from the debut singles. The four songs range from raucous post punk to minimalist experimental music, with socially conscious themes. The track “I Like Some of the Things You Do” for instance, refers to the aspects of Islam that Biesinger liked, or disliked, inspired by his honeymoon in Turkey at the end of Ramadan.
Members.
The band has two members, Raymond E. Biesinger on guitar and vocals, and Garrett Heath Kruger on the drums. Both members of the band have a history in the music industry, Biesinger being an ex-member of Edmonton band The Vertical Struts, and Kruger formerly of The Wolfnote. Kruger also works in the record business running an independent record distribution company called Put Out The Jams, while Biesinger works as a graphic designer.

Michel Charles Durieu de Maisonneuve

Michel Charles Durieu de Maisonneuve (7 December 1796 – 20 February 1878) was a French soldier and botanist who was a native of Saint-Eutrope-de-Born in the department of Lot-et-Garonne.
He studied at École Militaire de Brienne, and later at the military school of Saint-Cyr, where he received the rank of sub-lieutenant. He entered military service in 1813, and would be associated with the French army until 1848. He participated in the Battle of Trocadero at Cadiz, and was involved in the 1843 Battle of Smala against the forces of Abd-El-Kader (1808–1883). 
In the mid-1820s Durieu de Maisonneuve developed an interest in natural history and botany by studying fresh water algae. He participated in the Morea expedition to Greece with naturalist Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent (1778–1846), and in 1840-44 was a member of a committee for scientific exploration of Algeria. During his years in the military he also performed botanical excursions in France, Spain and northern Portugal.
Durieu de Maisonneuve studied cryptogam species wirh Bory de Saint-Vincent, Camille Montagne (1784–1866), Joseph-Henri Léveillé (1796–1870), and the brothers Charles (1817–1884) and Louis René Tulasne (1815–1885). He also performed research of spermatophytes with Ernest Cosson (1819–1889), who was an authority of North African flora.
In 1858 he succeeded Jean François Laterrade (1784–1858) as director of the botanical garden at Bordeaux, and from 1867 to 1877 was a professor of botany in Bordeaux.

Mount McDowell

Mount McDowell (O'odham: S-wegĭ Doʼag, Yavapai: Wi:kawatha), more commonly referred to as Red Mountain, is located on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Reservation, just north of Mesa, Arizona. It is named after General Irvin McDowell, a Union officer in the Civil War. Its elevation is . It is not the same landmark as the McDowell Peak, which is away to the northwest.
Mount McDowell is often called "Red Mountain" or "FireRock", due to its composition of sandstone conglomerate which gives it a distinctive red color that glows during sunset. The deep cleft on its western side (visible in the image at right) is known as "Gunsight" because of its resemblance to the narrow slot in a fort used for firing at attackers.
The mountain is very photogenic but it's difficult to photograph up close. The mountain is located on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Reservation, and has been declared off-limits to hikers, climbers and photographers since the early 1980s, due to vandalism. The eastern side, along Power Road/Bush Highway, has areas where you can pull off the road, and there's a picnic area just north of Granite Reef Dam (Tonto Pass required).
The western side of the mountain is along SR 87 (Beeline Highway), which is a busy four-lane road with narrow shoulders. There are several blocked roads onto the Salt River Indian Reservation, where you can pull off for a minute if the traffic is light.

<doc id="19821598" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19821598" title="Yarasuchus">
Yarasuchus

Yarasuchus is an extinct genus of rauisuchian, a group of predatory and large Triassic archosaurs. It lived during the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic of India. Being only 2 metres long, is was one of the smallest rauisuchians known. The genus was named and described in 2005 from incomplete fossil material found from the Middle Triassic Yerrapalli Formation, thought to be from two individuals, with one being much more complete and articulated than the other. The type and only species is "Y. deccanensis".
Description.
The cervical vertebrae that make up the neck of "Yarasuchus" are characteristically elongated, while the skull is proportionally small. The genus is also distinguished from other prestosuchids by a delicately built pectoral girdle and a continuous acromion process of the scapula. The neural spines of the vertebrae are high and the paramedian osteoderms are greatly sculptured with a ridge running anteroposteriorly along each one.
Paleobiology.
"Yarasuchus" may have had a facultatively bipedal gait. 
Many other vertebrate remains have been found from the Yerrapalli Formation alongside those of "Yarasuchus", and would have coexisted with the genus during the Middle Triassic. Remains of the prolacertiform "Pamelaria dolichotrachela" have been found in close proximity to those of "Yarasuchus". Other vertebrate remains include those of the dipnoan "Ceratodus", the actinopterygian "Saurichthys", the temnospondyl "Parotosuchus", and the dicynodonts "Rechnisaurus" and "Wadiasaurus".
Classification.
It was originally described as a prestosuchid, but Brusatte "et al." (2010) found it to be a poposauroid in a detailed cladistic analysis.

Morane-Saulnier MS.43

__NOTOC__
The Morane-Saulnier MS.43 was a French two-seat training biplane designed and built by Morane-Saulnier for a 1924 French War Ministry requirement for an intermediate training biplane. 
The MS.43 was developed from the prototype MS.42; the equal-span wings of the MS.42 were replaced with the upper wing having a greater span than the lower. The structure was also strengthened for its training role, it being expected that trainee pilots would land it hard on airfields with rough surfaces. The aircraft had tandem cockpits with dual controls and was powered by a 180hp (134kW) Hispano-Suiza V-8 engine. The aircraft entered service with the French Air Force and 79 were built. In 1929 the aircraft were withdrawn from service and sold on the civilian market.

List of Academy Awards for Walt Disney

Walt Disney (1901–66) won or received a total of twenty-six Academy Awards, and holds the record for most Academy Awards in history. He won a total of twenty-two competitive Academy Awards from a total of fifty-nine nominations, and also holds the records for most wins and most nominations for an individual in history.
Disney won his first competitive Academy Award and received his first Honorary Academy Award at the 5th Academy Awards (1932). He received the Honorary Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse and won the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoon) for the film "Flowers and Trees".

Phoebe Ann Patten

Phoebe Ann Babcock Patten Bentley (c. 1807 – January 15, 1841) was an early member and missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, as well as a caretaker during the 1838 Mormon War and wife of early church leader and apostle David W. Patten. Little is known about her childhood except that she was born "Ann Babcock" sometime around 1807. At age 21, Babcock met David W. Patten. The two married in 1828, and Babcock adopted Patten's surname.
After her husband joined the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints) in 1832, Ann was converted and baptized in the same year. While David was away on various missions, Ann Patten lived with other members of the church in Ohio and Missouri and supported herself financially by working as a seamstress. Ann also served a mission to Tennessee with her husband, an assignment almost unheard of at the time.
Following her husband's death at the Battle of Crooked River in 1838, Ann remarried Benjamin R. Bently, a young carpenter and non-Mormon who was living with the Pattens when David died. After a couple of years of marriage, Ann died of consumption on January 5, 1841, at the age of thirty-four.
Early life.
Little is known about Phoebe Ann Babcock's early life. Born sometime around 1807, Babcock was living in Dundee, Michigan with her family when she met David W. Patten, a farmer who had recently moved to Michigan from New York and who was seven years her senior. The two married in 1828 in Dundee. It is not known how many children they had, but not one survived to adulthood.
Conversion and Membership.
David W. Patten joined the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints) in 1832 after hearing about it from his older brother, John Patten. After her husband's conversion, Ann joined the church the same year. In the years that followed, David was sent on several missions throughout the United States. During this time, Ann Patten supported herself by working as a seamstress and sharing housing with other members of the church in Ohio and Missouri.
Ann continued to support her husband for the rest of his life as he served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. When David was called to serve a mission to Tennessee, Ann decided to accompany him. A wife traveling with her husband on a mission was almost unheard of in the early days of the church. In addition, during conflicts between Mormons and non-Mormons during the 1838 Mormon War, while many of the leaders of the church were imprisoned or away, Ann served as a caretaker for many of the members in the area. Helen Mar Whitney, a member at the time, wrote about Patten:
"She was a noble and self-sacrificing woman, who left all for the gospel's sake... she was early thrown upon her own resources, and though she had a slight and delicate frame she had a persevering and energetic spirit..."
In 1838, David W. Patten was mortally wounded at the Battle of Crooked River. During this time, Ann was living in Far West, Missouri and was quite ill. Ann went with Joseph Smith, Jr., Hyrum Smith, and Heber C. Kimball to where David was dying. Right before he died, David spoke to Ann and said "Whatever you do else, Oh do not deny the faith." Soon afterwards he died.
Immediately after David's death all of the men in Far West were compelled to surrender their weapons and several members of a mob were looting houses in Far West, as a result of Missouri Executive Order 44. Vilate Kimball, a Mormon in Far West, said of Ann Patten's response to the mobs:
"I can never forget her fearless and determined look. Around her waist was a belt to which was attached a large Bowie knife. She had a fire in her stove and a large iron kettle full of boiling water and a big tin dipper in her hand intending, she said, to fight if any of the demons came there. She did not seem in the least excited, her countenance was perfectly calm and she shed no tears."
Despite her illness, during this time Ann Patten took care of several members of the church, including several women whose husbands were imprisoned at the time.
Remarriage.
During this time of turmoil, Ann remarried Benjamin R. Bently soon after David W. Patten's death. Bently was a young non-Mormon carpenter who had been living with the Pattens at the time of David's death. Unable to work because she was seriously ill with consumption, Ann accepted when Bently proposed, even though the marriage was deemed inappropriate for the wife of an Apostle to marry a non-Mormon. Bently later joined the church.
Death.
Following the expulsion of the Mormons from Missouri, the couple moved to Quincy, Illinois, where they rented a two-bedroom home. However, Ann Patten Bently finally succumbed to consumption on January 5, 1841, after fighting the disease for five years, at the age of 34.
After Ann's death, Benjamin Bently remarried Rhonda Ann Thompson in 1846. Ann Bently died while living in Nauvoo, Illinois, possibly from consumption.

Lagorai

The Lagorai is a mountain range in the Eastern Alps, in Trentino, northern Italy.
It is located between the Monte Panarotta (16 km) from Trento and Rolle Pass, for a length of some 70 km. It is bounded southwards by the Valsugana, by the Val di Fiemme from north, the Val di Cembra from west and the Primiero and Vanoi easthwards. 
The chain is mostly made of porphyry rocks.
The north-eastern part in the massif is part of the Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino Natural Park. Near the Rolle Pass, at some 2,000 m of altitude, are the small lakes of Colbricon, home of pre-historic settlements dating to the Neolithic age.

Suite española

Isaac Albéniz’s Suite española, Op. 47, is a suite for solo piano. It is mainly composed of works written in 1886 which were grouped together in 1887, in honour of the Queen of Spain. Like many of Albeniz’s works for the piano, these pieces depict different regions and musical styles in Spain.
Origins of the suite.
The work originally consisted of four pieces: "Granada", "Cataluña", "Sevilla" and "Cuba". The editor Hofmeister republished the "Suite española" in 1912, after Albéniz's death, but added "Cádiz", "Asturias", "Aragón" and "Castilla". The other pieces had been published in other editions and sometimes with different titles ("Asturias" was originally the prelude from the suite "Chants d'Espagne").
The four pieces that Hofmeister added do not exactly reflect the geographical region to which they refer. A clear example of this is "Asturias (Leyenda)", whose Andalusian Flamenco rhythms have little to do with the Atlantic region of Asturias. Opus 47, the number assigned by Hofmeister, does not have any chronological relation to any of Albéniz’s other works, since the opus numbers of the pieces were randomly assigned by publishers and Albéniz himself. Despite the spurious nature of the "Suite española", however, it has become one of the most performed of Albéniz's piano works, a favorite of both pianists and audiences.
The music.
In these works the first title refers to the geographical region portrayed, and the title in parentheses is the musical form or dance from that region. From Granada in Andalusia there is a Serenata, from Catalonia a Curranda or Courante, from Sevilla a Sevillanas and from Cuba (which was still part of Spain in the 1880s) a Notturno in the style of a habanera, from Castile a Seguidillas, from Aragon a Fantasia in the style of a jota, and from Cadiz a Saeta. This last example, like Asturias (Leyenda), is geographically inaccurate.
Pieces.
In the works constituting the "Suite española", the first title makes reference to the region that each piece represents and the subtitle in brackets indicates the musical form of the dance of the region.
The suite has been orchestrated by other hands, including a well-known version by Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos. Arrangements of individual works and indeed the entire suite are often played in concert by classical guitarists.
In fact, "Granada", "Sevilla", "Cadiz" and "Asturias" are more often heard on guitar than in their original piano versions; all four have been staples of the guitar literature since early in the 20th century. "Cataluña" and "Cuba" became solo guitar staples in the 1980s. The remaining pieces, "Aragón" and "Castilla," have been transcribed for guitar solo but are more often heard in multiple-guitar transcriptions.

Robert L. Glass

Robert L. (Bob) Glass (born 1932) is an American software engineer and writer, known for his works on software engineering, especially on the measuring of the quality of software design and his studies of the state of the art of software engineering research.
Biography.
Glass held his first job in computing in 1954. He worked from 1954 to 1957 in the aerospace industry at North American Aviation, from 1957 to 1965 at Aerojet-General Corp. and from 1965 to 1982 at Boeing Company, where he built software tools used by applications specialists.
Between 1970 and 1972, Glass had worked on a tools-focused research grant at the University of Washington. From 1982 to 1987, he taught in the Software Engineering graduate program at Seattle University, and subsequently spent a year at the Software Engineering Institute. Early 2000s he has been visiting professor at the Linköping University in Sweden and at the Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. The Linkoping University awarded him a honorary Ph.D. in 1995.
He is the emeritus editor-in-chief of the "Journal of Systems and Software" and also writes regular columns for "Communications of the ACM" and "IEEE Software". In 1995 he was awarded an honorary Ph.D. from Linkoping University of Sweden, and in 1999 he was named a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) professional society.
After 45 years in the field Glass described himself as "my head is in the academic area of computing, but my heart is in its practice."
Writing in "IEEE Software" in 2000, Glass criticized open-source software, predicting that it will not reach far, and "will be limited to one or a few cults emerging from a niche culture." Glass's basis for this bold prediction was that open-source software "goes against the grain of everything I know about the software field".

Brashlyan

Brashlyan (, "ivy") is a village in southeastern Bulgaria, part of Malko Tarnovo municipality, Burgas Province. Known as Sarmashik until 1934, today the entire village is an architectural reserve displaying characteristic Strandzha wooden architecture from the mid-17th to the 19th century.
Brashlyan lies in the low Strandzha mountains of Bulgaria's southeast, northwest of Malko Tarnovo, south of Burgas and from the Bulgaria–Turkey border. The village traces its foundation to the 17th century when the residents of the Yurtet, Selishte and Zhivak neighbourhoods settled in the Lower Neighbourhood of Brashlyan. The village was mentioned in Ottoman tax registers of the mid-17th century as part of the district of Anchialos (Pomorie) and grew into a major centre of animal husbandry by the 19th century. The old name "Sarmashik" was from Ottoman Turkish "sarmaşık" and had the same meaning, "ivy".
The Sarmashik Affair, a predecessor of the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising, took place in Brashlyan in 1903. A band of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Revolutionary Organization was surrounded by Ottoman troops in the Balyuva House on 2 April; the band leader ("voivode") Pano Angelov and the member Nikola Ravashola were killed by the Ottomans. The locals also participated in the actual uprising. According to Lyubomir Miletich's demographic survey of the Ottoman province of Edirne in "The Destruction of Thracian Bulgarians in 1913", published in 1918, before the wars Sarmashik (Сармашикъ) was a village in the district of Malko Tarnovo inhabited by 150 Bulgarian Exarchist families.
The village became part of the Kingdom of Bulgaria in 1913, after the Balkan Wars. Since the mid-20th century, many local residents have moved to Burgas or Malko Tarnovo. From a population of 650 in 1926, the village's inhabitants have decreased to around 50 by 2008. In 1982, Brashlyan was proclaimed an architectural and historical reserve. 76 local houses from the 18th–19th century are cultural monuments, of which nine are of national importance. The oldest house dates to the mid-17th century and is still inhabited. The monastical school (working in 1871–1877), the St Pantaleon, St Petka and St Marina chapels and the 17th-century bell tower of the St Demetrius Church have been restored by a local association; an ethnographic collection and an open air museum of agriculture were set up as well. There are traces of Thracian sanctuaries and dolmens several kilometres from the village.
Brashlyan is part of the Strandzha Natural Park. The village's territory borders that of the Vitanovo reserve, the Veleka river valley and the trout breeding pool on the Katun River. The village's fair is organized annually in early August, usually around the 8th, and lasts two days. Brashlyan is mentioned in the "Strandzha Marseillaise", the song "The Clear Moon is Already Rising", written by the leader of the Lozengrad revolutionary district Yani Popov:

The explorer John Biscoe in the brig "Tula" searched for the Nimrod Group without success in 1831 during the Southern Ocean Expedition. John King Davis in the "Nimrod" searched the location in June 1909 following Shackleton's famous Nimrod Expedition to Antarctica, and the Norwegian vessel "Norvegia" outfitted by Lars Christensen searched again in 1930; both expeditions reported empty seas. Captain J.P. Ault of the magnetic survey vessel "Carnegie" attempted to approach the location in December 1915 but was deterred by weather.

Stephens (first name and dates unknown) was an English cricketer who played for Dartford and Kent during the 1750s.
Career.
Stephens is first mentioned when he played for All-England against his native Kent in the two matches at the Artillery Ground in May 1751. 
He is not mentioned again until 1759 when he took part in the three Dartford v All-England matches which are the only first-class matches found in the 1759 sources. 
As Stephens had established his reputation by 1751, he must have been active for some years previously. His career probably began in the 1740s and continued into the 1760s but it was a period when very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports.

Thornton v. United States

Thornton v. United States, 541 U.S. 615 (2004), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that when a police officer makes a lawful custodial arrest of an automobile's occupant, the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution allows the officer to search the vehicle's passenger compartment as a contemporaneous incident of arrest. "Thornton" extended "New York v. Belton", ruling that it governs even when an officer does not make contact until the person arrested has left the vehicle. "Thornton" also suggests a separate justification for an evidentiary search "when it is reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle." 541 U.S., at 632. 
"Thornton" and "Belton" were distinguished by "Arizona v. Gant", which restricted searches incident to arrest to circumstance where: 1) it is reasonable to believe that the arrested individual might access the vehicle at the time of the search; or 2) it is reasonable to believe that arrested individual's vehicle contains evidence of the offense that led to the arrest; or 3) the officer has probable cause to believe that there may be evidence of a crime concealed within the vehicle. Thus, while "Arizona v. Gant" modifies the search incident to arrest doctrine, it also leaves intact certain legal justifications for warrantless searches set forth in Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969), "Thornton", and United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798 (1982).

The Sateré-Mawé (or Sateré-Maue) is an indigenous tribe located in the Brazilian Amazon, with an estimated population of about 10,761. The Sateré-Mawé are the first to domesticate and cultivate guarana, a popular stimulant.
Name.
They are also called Maué, Mawé, Mabue, Maragua, Sataré, Andira, Arapium.
Language.
The Mawé speak the Sateré-Mawé language, which belongs to the Tupian family. A grammar book was developed for the language in 1986.
Initiation rites.
The Satere-Mawe people use intentional bullet ant stings as part of their initiation rites to become a warrior. The ants are first rendered unconscious by submerging them in a natural sedative and then hundreds of them are woven into a glove made out of leaves (which resembles a large oven mitt), stinger facing inward. When the ants regain consciousness, a boy slips the glove onto his hand. The goal of this initiation rite is to keep the glove on for a full ten minutes. When finished, the boy's hand and part of his arm are temporarily paralyzed due to the ant venom, and he may shake uncontrollably for days. The only "protection" provided is a coating of charcoal on the hands, supposedly to confuse the ants and inhibit their stinging. To fully complete the initiation, however, the boys must go through the ordeal a total of 20 times over the course of several months or even years.

"Selfless" is the 69th episode of the American television series "Prison Break" and was broadcast on November 24, 2008 in the United States on the Fox Network.
Plot.
The General and two of his bodyguards enter the vault to stop Michael from taking Scylla. However, when they exit the elevator, they are held at gunpoint by Lincoln, Mahone, and Sucre. The General reluctantly hands over the sixth final card but was shocked when he sees that the convicts possess all other cards, allowing Michael to access the unit and take Scylla. The convicts then take the elevator back upstairs and barricade themselves in the General's office. Meanwhile, Self and Trishanne are still being held captive by Feng, but Trishanne yells to create a distraction, and Self gets free and kills their captors, and Trishanne kills Feng instinctively, which seems to make Self concerned. At GATE, Mr White introduces himself to Gretchen, who is once again conferring with T-Bag, only to see their machine guns under the desk. Mr White slips back to his office, but Gretchen holds him at gunpoint while T-Bag forces the other hostages into the office. Back at Company headquarters, the General believes that the convicts have no plan and are trapped when he gets a phone call. It's from Sara, who has Lisa Tabak—a cardholder and the General's daughter—at gunpoint in a hotel bathroom. To save his daughter, the General allows the convicts to go free. They drive to the airport in a Company truck for a rendezvous with Self, where Sucre and Mahone go their own way while Michael and Lincoln head into the airport. Company agents stop the brothers and take their backpack (which contains the Scylla unit), only to be caught themselves by airport police tipped off by Mahone. When the agents and the police search the brothers' backpack, they realise Scylla isn't there: Sucre and Mahone had it the whole time. In the GATE offices, Trishanne returns to resume her cover only to discover the hostage situation. She tries to free the hostages, and although Mr. White is killed by Gretchen, she manages to force T-Bag and Gretchen out of the building. In the parking lot, Gretchen tries to double-cross T-Bag when Trishanne shows up in a car. Gretchen escapes, but T-Bag is caught and arrested.
Self meets the group at the warehouse after the successful mission. Michael hands over Scylla, and Self gives them an envelope full of release papers and tells them that Homeland Security are sending vans to take them for final processing, and an ambulance to take Michael to the hospital. While the group contemplates their imminent freedom, Self meets Trishanne in an abandoned lot, where she has T-Bag handcuffed in her car. Self verifies what she and T-Bag know about the potential Scylla buyers, before apologizing to her and pulling out his gun and killing her by shooting her in the stomach. In the warehouse, the group has been waiting for an hour. Michael calls Self on his mobile phone, which is now disconnected. He opens the envelope that supposedly contains the group's release papers, but it's full of blank sheets of paper, and they realize that Self has betrayed them.
Reception.
IGN called it the best episode of the entire series, giving it a perfect score of 10 out of 10.

Macrocognition

Macrocognition indicates a descriptive level of cognition performed in natural instead of artificial (laboratory) environments. This term is reported to have been coined by Pietro Cacciabue and Erik Hollnagel in 1995. However, it is also reported that the term was used in the 1980s in European Cognitive Systems Engineering research. Possibly the earliest reference is the following, although it does not use the exact term "macrocognition":
A macro-theory is a theory which is concerned with the obvious regularities of human experience, rather than with some theoretically defined unit. To refer to another psychological school, it would correspond to a theory at the level of Gestalten. It resembles Newell’s suggestion for a solution that would analyse more complex tasks, although the idea of a macro-theory does not entail an analysis of the mechanistic materialistic kind which is predominant in cognitive psychology. Thus we should have a macro-theory of remembering rather than of memory, to say nothing of short-term memory, proactive inhibition release, or memory scanning. To take another example, we should have a macro-theory of attending, rather than a mini-theory of attention, or micro-theories of limited channel capacities or logarithmic dependencies in disjunctive reaction times. This would ease the dependence on the information processing analogy, but not necessarily lead to an abandonment of the information processing terminology, the Flowchart, or the concept of control structures. The meta-technical sciences can contribute to a psychology of cognition as well as to cognitive psychology. What should be abandoned is rather the tendency to think in elementaristic terms and to increase the plethora of mini-and micro-theories.
To conclude, if the psychological study of cognition shall have a future that is not a continued description of human information processing, its theories must be at what we have called the macro-level. This means that they must correspond to the natural units of experience and consider these in relation to the regularities of human experience, rather than as manifestations of hypothetical information processing mechanisms in the brain. A psychology should start at the level of natural units in human experience and try to work upwards towards the level of functions and human action, rather than downwards towards the level of elementary information processes and the structure of the IPS.
The use of the term suggests that there is strong evidence in which naturalistic decision-making and the environments in which they occur are navigated in cognitively different ways than artificial or controlled environments.
Since the coining of this term there have been a number of publications in this research area. As of 2013-10-31 a Google Scholar search returns 1,150 items.
Macrocognition is distinguished from microcognition by elements of time-pressure and risk, performance by experts (as opposed to college students or novices), ambiguity of goals and outcomes, and complex and unclear conditions.

Open Het Dorp

Open Het Dorp ("Open The Village") was the first big fundraising TV show in the Netherlands. It aired on Dutch TV on 26 and 27 November 1962.
"Het Dorp" is a special village/community for disabled people. To raise the required funds to build and open the community a TV show was organized.
The program was at that moment the first nation-wide fundraising TV-show, lasting for 23 hours. Mies Bouwman entirely presented it. Most local corner-shops cooperated: viewers could donate by putting cash in a small box (matchbox) and bring it to the local shop: most shops opened their doors on the evening of 26 November; the show was aired on TV and radio simultaneously as large numbers of people did not own a TV at that time.
Director of the TV show was Theo Orderman. During the show over 400 artists and other VIPs appeared in the show.
After 23 hours fundraising a total amount of 21 million Dutch guilders was collected which was used to open the community for disabled people "Het Dorp" near the city of Arnhem.
In the archives only short fragments are available regarding this event.

Mare Nostrum (video game)

Mare Nostrum is a multiplayer team-based first-person action video game, developed as a total conversion modification of .
The overall aim of the modification is to incorporate the African, Mediterranean and Middle East theatres of World War II as a supplement to the "" title.
Gameplay.
"Mare Nostrum" game play is similar to its parent game, in that players assume the role of an individual infantryman or tank crew during World War II battles in an online multiplayer environment. Each team then attempts to accomplish objectives varying by game level. 
Most play revolves around an Attack and Defend style, whereby one team has to take objective areas from the opposing team in order to claim victory.
History.
The "Mare Nostrum" team was formed 8 Aug 2006 with the merger of 2 separate modification teams; "Campagna Italiana" team and the "Burning Sands" team.
The "Mare Nostrum" game project is current subdivided into two phases which reflects the original merger. The first is titled 'Mare Nostrum: Afrikafeldzug 40-43' which concentrates on the actions during the North African Campaign. The second, unreleased, phase is titled 'Mare Nostrum: Campagna Italiana 43-45', and will encompass actions in and around Sicily and main land Italy.
The first public release of the modification was on 1 March 2008. Subsequent additional releases quickly came to address software bugs and gameplay issues with the 1.1 release on 8 March 2008 and 1.2 release on 23 March 2008.
On October 17, 2008, "Mare Nostrum" was released on Steam. Due to Steam's automatic update feature, version numbers were dropped and all further versions were released exclusively on Steam.
On December 11, 2009 "Mare Nostrum" received a large content update through Steam which added Steam Achievements, making it the first Red Orchestra mod to do so.
Reception.
"Mare Nostrum" was named as one of the ModDB top 100 unreleased mods during the 2007 event.
Although the 1.2 release was considered a playable product, there were issues building an online player base.
Name Etymology.
Mare Nostrum (Latin for "Our Sea") was a Roman name for the Mediterranean Sea. In the years following the unification of Italy in 1861, the term was revived by Italian nationalists who believed that Italy was the successor state to the Roman Empire, and should seek to control ex-Roman territories in the Mediterranean.

<doc id="19822334" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19822334" title="Sunny Corner, New South Wales">
Sunny Corner, New South Wales

Sunny Corner is a small village in the central west of New South Wales, Australia and former mining area located between Lithgow and Bathurst just north of the Great Western Highway (Route 32). At the 2006 census, Sunny Corner had a population of 626 people.
The township was originally called Mitchell or Mitchell's Creek but the local community always called the area Sunny Corner and the name continued in use.
The original inhabitants of the area later called Sunny Corner were Aboriginal people, probably from the Wiradjuri tribe or nation. Although by the time written records of the area were created there were no Aboriginal people living there, Powys notes some archaeological evidence of their occupation in the form of stone axes.
The town of Sunny Corner grew up following the discovery of silver lodes in the area in 1884. This prompted a "rush" to the area, which had previously not been settled, and a town grew up on Crown Land adjacent to the mining leases. 
The village of Sunny Corner was formally gazetted on 2 October 1885 (as R No 122). The gazette also revoked temporary reserves presumably gazetted to cover the rush to Sunny Corner. Immediately to the north-west a recreation reserve was gazetted, and a camping reserve was located on the southern border of the town.
In January 1886 an anonymous correspondent to the "Sydney Morning Herald" described Sunny Corner as having a population "anything from 1600 to 3000". The town was described as follows:
"there is one long, comparatively straight sheet, on which most of the dwellings are built, while here and there about the ranges habitations are dotted in all sorts of nooks and corners. A galvanised iron roof is de rigueur, but the materials for the wall may be either "wattle and daub" sawn hardwood, or slabs cut with an adze. The names for such buildings as are the general resort of the public are of the most select type. There are the Royal, the Criterion, and Star Hotels, and the Carrington billiard room the Sunny Corner Boot Palace, Sunny Corner Coffee Palace and the Tattersall's saddler's store." 
Later, on 3 September 1887, the village was gazetted as a town. 
The 1885 survey plan shows a number of buildings and features "in situ" at the time of the survey and thus records the nature of the township at that time.
Mining at Sunny Corner.
Early mining in the Sunny Corner area is poorly documented, largely because it was a small field and systematic reporting by the Mines Department had not been implemented at that time (in the 1850s). Matters are even more confused as there was another Mitchell's Creek near Wellington (located near Bodangora, to the north east of Wellington) which is mentioned in newspapers of the early 1850s as being a goldfield. Thus records of gold being found at Mitchell's Creek could refer to several locations.
A report in the "Bathurst Free Press" in July 1852 of a Mr Moffitt finding gold in a quartz reef at Mitchells Creek located in the headwaters of the Turon River is likely to be in the vicinity of Sunny Corner. A newspaper description of the field in 1884 notes: "Gold was first discovered about Mitchell's Creek in 1852, and two years afterwards it was somewhat extensively worked as an alluvial held, every watercourse about the place returning payable gold, and in some instances proving very rich. In 1856 auriferous quartz was found on the field…" 
The quartz reefs were mined from the early 1860s until the 1880s. In 1881 assays of the ore found in association with the quartz revealed a rich concentration of silver and mining interest turned to the exploitation of the silver ores rather than the gold.
Silver, gold, zinc and antimony were mined between 1875 to 1922, during which time more than 100 tonnes of silver were won.

Erik Rolfsen was born in Ålesund, More og Romsdal county, Norway. Rolfsen took his final exams at Kristiansund Public School in 1924. He attended the Drawing Academy in Paris during 1926. In 1930 he took his final exam in architecture at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim. 
He worked in Kristiansund from 1940, but from 1942 to 1945 he was a consultant for the Norwegian government-in-exile. From 1947 to 1973 he was the director of city planning in Oslo and put their mark on the city during a period of intense development. After the merger of Oslo and Aker in 1948, Rolfsen prepared a general plan for the new large municipal area. The plan was to connect residential areas and laid the foundation for post-war housing in Oslo. Rolfsen favored a strong future-oriented regional plan, where residential areas, workplaces and education centers were coordinated to reduce travel distances. Central to his urban planning was the preservation of nature as an essential part of the city. 
He was a guest lecturer at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1947 and lecturer in architecture courses at the National Craft and Industrial Art School 1947–49. He was chairman of the Oslo architect Association 1948–49. Rolfsen was a member of the Norwegian Labour Party and served in a variety of public committees and advice on urban issues. He presided over the International Federation for Housing and Planning from 1954 to 1958.

Ochiichagwe'Babigo'Ining Ojibway Nation

Ochiichagwe'Babigo'Ining Ojibway Nation, formerly but still commonly—and incorrectly—known as the Dalles First Nation, is an Ojibwa or Ontario Saulteaux First Nation located in Kenora District, Ontario near Sioux Narrows of Lake of the Woods. 
Total registered population in February, 2008, was 334, of which the on-reserve population was 127. A member of Treaty 3, the First Nation is affiliated with Bimose Tribal Council and Kenora Chiefs Advisory.
Reserves.
The First Nation have reserved for themselves two reserves:
Grievances.
The First Nation has recently settled two grievances against Hydro One and Ontario Power Generation. The grievance against Hydro One was started because the company arbitrarily cut down trees, and misappropriated land without making any effort to consult the First Nation to install huge steel electricity pylons across the reserve. Hydro One acknowledged liability (without an apology) by settling the claim for an undisclosed amount.
The grievance against Ontario Power Generation was a far bigger issue. Many years ago, again without notice or an effort to consult with the First Nation, what used to be called Ontario Hydro arbitrarily flooded over one thousand acres (4 km²) of reserve land and many more thousands of acres of traditional resource area by building the Whitedog Dam to provide electricity for sale by Ontario Hydro.
The detrimental effects of the flooding and water flow change resulted in a huge loss of culture for the area's First Nation people, including but not limited to the loss of cultural activities such as hunting, and rice harvesting.
Ontario Power Generation acknowledged liability by settling for an undisclosed amount. Also, unlike Hydro One, Ontario Power Generation officially apologized for the harm to the community during a visit to the community by Jake Epp, Chairman of the Board.
Legal grievances remain as a result of Canada's Federal Government giving Ontario Power Generation permission to reroute the Winnipeg River through the reserve via the relief channel blasted through the reserve.
A rock sacred to the people of Ochiichagwe'Babigo'Ining was also completely destroyed by explosives to clear way for the water channel.
Governance.
Through the Custom Electoral System, Ochiichagwe'Babigo'Ining elects a council for a two-year term consisting of a Chief and four Councillors. The current chief is Lorraine Cobiness. The four Councillors are Ernest Jameson, John Henry, Mervin Copenace and Martina Strong (nee White).
The traditional 'Customary Council' system is the Nation's preferred method of governance. The Customary Council is where a respected head person or speaker from each of the family groups within the Nation is chosen and this group of head people are the ones who have advisory powers and dispute resolving responsibility. Chief and Council is a relatively new system of governance, and the current are supposed to be gradually phasing themselves out in favour of the Customary Council system.

John George Howard

John George Howard, (July 27, 1803 – February 3, 1890) born John Corby, was the City of Toronto, Canada's official surveyor and civil engineer. He was also the first professional architect in Toronto, architect of numerous public, commercial and residential buildings in Toronto in the 19th century and the principal donor of High Park to the people of Toronto.
Personal life.
Born John Corby in Bengeo, Hertfordshire, England in 1803, Howard was the fourth of seven children of John and Sarah Corby. He attended a boarding-school in Hertford and spent two years at sea as a sailor before return to England to become a carpenter and joiner. In 1824, he entered the architecture profession, articling for three years to a London architect, William Ford, who became his brother-in-law, marrying Howard's older sister in 1825. Corby remained with Ford until his departure for Canada. In London, Howard met and married his wife Jemima Frances Meikle on May 7, 1827.
John and Jemima emigrated to Canada in 1832. It was at this time that Howard adopted the Howard surname. He himself gave two explanations. On February 11, 1834, when his change of name was revealed in a court case Howard wrote to Lieutenant Governor Sir John Colborne’s secretary, explaining that he was illegitimate, that when he was about 18 he had adopted the name Corby after the man his mother had subsequently married, and that he had assumed 'his proper name' when he left England. Later in life he claimed direct descent from Thomas Howard, the 4th Duke of Norfolk, through a 17th-century Howard who had adopted the name Corby from the ancestral estate Corby Castle, because of a family quarrel.
John and Jemima remained married until death, however John maintained a lifelong relationship with Mary Williams, with whom he had three children. John and Jemima themselves had no children. In 1877, Jemima died of cancer. Howard lived until 1890, dying at home at Colborne Lodge in High Park. The Howards are buried in High Park; the monument is near to Colborne Lodge.
Professional career.
Howard was an associate of William Ford from 1824–1832, with one notable engineering project working on the Cromford Canal in Derbyshire, England.
When Howard arrived in Toronto (at that time still the town of York) in 1833, he was the first professional architect in Toronto. His first public appointment was a teaching master at Upper Canada College (UCC), while developing an architectural practise. He remained affiliated with UCC until 1856. His practise thrived with commissions ranging from cottages to banks to public projects, including Queen's College of Kingston, Ontario, the King Street Gaol and the Provincial Lunatic Asylum in Toronto (modelled on the National Gallery (London)).
Howard started surveying work in 1836, become Toronto's official surveyor in 1843, a position he held until 1855. He surveyed Toronto harbour, laid out the 'Esplanade' on the waterfront, and subdivided the harbour's peninsula (now known as Toronto Island). He also did surveying work for cemeteries and private land sub-divisions. He also bought some land of his own, including the property now known as High Park, bought as a sheep farm and Sunnyside Farm to the east of the Park, now the site of St. Joseph's Health Centre. The area retains the nickname of 'Sunnyside'.
In 1873, in return for a yearly pension of $1,200, Howard deeded of his High Park property to the city as a public park; the remaining and Colborne Lodge became city property at his death. Howard was appointed forest ranger by the city in 1878, with responsibility for improving the park.

Harilaid (islet)

Harilaid (Swedish "Hares", formerly "Gräsö") is small uninhabited island in Estonia. It lies about 4 kilometres west of the island of Vormsi. It should not be confused with the larger former island of Harilaid which is now a peninsula on the northwest coast of the island of Saaremaa. 
Harilaid has an area of 15 hectares. Its highest point is 2.9 metres above sea level. The island is stony, with a covering of juniper.
A lighthouse was first built on Harilaid in 1849. The present lighthouse is 19 metres high.

Big Apple (TV series)

Big Apple is an American television drama series that was originally broadcast in the United States on CBS in 2001. The story centers on two New York City Police Department detectives Mooney (Ed O'Neill) and Trout (Jeffrey Pierce) working with the FBI to solve a murder with ties to organized crime. A subplot involves Mooney's sister (played by Brooke Smith) who is receiving hospice care for Lou Gehrig's Disease.
"Big Apple" was originally slated to compete with NBC's very popular medical drama series "ER". Although 13 episodes were commissioned, only 8 aired before CBS canceled the show and replaced it with the newsmagazine "48 Hours" in the 10pm (EST) Thursday time slot. In 2008, the series aired in syndication on Universal HD.
Reception.
Reviews of the show were largely positive. "Variety" called it "a triumph all around" and compared it favorably to "NYPD Blue" and "Murder One". "Entertainment Weekly" praised O'Neill's performance as Detective Mooney and gave the show higher marks than Denis Leary's "The Job".

Theta Alpha Phi

Theta Alpha Phi National Theatre Honors Fraternity (ΘΑΦ) is an American recognition honor society that accepts members who achieve excellence in the art of theatre. Membership is available to undergraduates and graduate students at member institutions. 
The first chapter, referred to as "Oklahoma Alpha", was formed on December 22, 1919 at Oklahoma A&M College in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Since the dissolution of the National Collegiate Players/Pi Epsilon Delta (ΠΕΔ) National Theatre Honor Society, Theta Alpha Phi is the oldest honor society for theatre in the United States. Currently, the society has around 30 active chapters. Theta Alpha Phi can only be chartered at colleges & universities (four-year institutions).
The pronunciation of the society's name can be either "Thay-ta Al-fa Fye" or "Thay-ta Al-fa Fee". The latter is closer to the original Greek pronunciation.
The official colors of Theta Alpha Phi are Purple and White.
The motto of Theta Alpha Phi is "The purpose of playing is [...] to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature" (a reference to the "advice to the players" speech in "Hamlet"). 
Members are referred to as "Thetas," "Thetans," "TAPs," or "Taffies."

The History of Theta Alpha Phi.
Theta Alpha Phi National Theater Honors Fraternity is an honors society rather than a recognition association or activity club. It confers nationally recognized honor on graduate and undergraduate students who earn a specified high level of quality in theater study and production at over 36 selected, accredited colleges and universities in 22 states. 
Theta Alpha Phi is the only honorary theater organization restricted entirely to that level of education where students can be expected to have a serious purpose in theater work and study. It charters only four-year-or-more, Class "A" colleges and universities, has no branches or subsidiaries, and admits to membership only students of sophomore standing or above. 
Theta Alpha Phi is the only wholly independent theater honors organization with standards and functions established solely by its own constitution without regard to requirements of other organizations. It is not a member of any association whose member societies are concerned with areas other than theater, but which nevertheless control the standards and hence the functions of members. 
Theta Alpha Phi is the only national organization which honors graduate and undergraduate students for quality as well as quantity of work and study in theater arts alone. Unlike some organizations which demand that students achieve a certain level in all studies, most of which are unrelated to theater, Theta Alpha Phi demands excellence only in theater. Recognizing individual differences as a fact of life, Theta Alpha Phi believes a student can be outstanding in theater and deserving of honor in theater without comparable achievement in all areas of study. 
Theta Alpha Phi provides its members and member schools with greater prestige than any similar organization. Having been founded in 1919, it is the oldest, nation-wide, educational theater honors society in the world. Since its founding, it has consistently admitted only the finest colleges and universities with the highest academic standards and the highest theater standards in the nation. It is the only honorary which presents a national award. This "Medallion of Honor" is known as the highest national tribute made in educational theater. 
Theta Alpha Phi's magazine, "The Cue", is oriented distinctly and solely to students of theater in higher education. With articles, pictures and other features relevant to mature college students rather than to younger readers or faculty. "The Cue" stands alone in its field and provides a useful and important service not only to members, but to all students of theater. 
Theta Alpha Phi is a completely democratic organization. There is no secrecy, no "blackball," and no chapter or member discrimination on the basis of race, color or creed. The constitution, initiation ceremony, financial statements, and other records are available for inspection to any responsible person or organization. Throughout its history, however, Theta Alpha Phi has retained a consistent and dynamic "fraternity" policy of mutual aid among members and member schools. 
The first chapter was formed on December 22, 1919 at Oklahoma A & M College in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

Residential cluster development

A Residential Cluster Development, or conservation development, is the grouping of residential properties on a development site in order to use the extra land as open space, recreation or agriculture. It is increasingly becoming popular in subdivision development because it allows the developer to spend much less on land and obtain much the same price per unit as for detached houses. The shared garden areas can be a source of conflict however. Claimed advantages include more green/public space, closer community, and an optimal storm water management. Cluster development often encounters planning objections. 
According to William H. Whyte, the author of “Cluster Development” there are two types of cluster development. Townhouse development and super development. Examples of townhouse development include Morrell Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Hartshone in Richmond, and Dudley Square in Shreveport. Examples of Super Development include Reston, Virginia, Crofton, Maryland, and Americana Fairfax in Virginia.
Background.
In many ways cluster development has been practiced since the earliest communities — from the medieval village to the New England town. However, it wasn’t formalized as a modern concept until the onset of suburban sprawl and ubiquity of detached house developments. The idea of a Cluster development was created as the alternative to the ‘conventional subdivision’. The first conscious application of a Cluster development was in Radburn, New Jersey in 1928. Though it was based on English planning and Ebenezer Howard’s Garden Cities movement, it used principles of cluster development. Following Radburn, many other towns in New Jersey applied those principles to their planning notably the ‘village green’ in Hillsborough, NJ and Brunswick Hill in South Brunswick. In the rest of the country the use of cluster development grew in principally in Maryland and Virginia; notably in Reston and American Fairfax County.
Currently cluster development is applied all over the United States. There is particularly a strong push for it in the Midwestern states that have had significant problems with large lot suburban sprawl, such as Minnesota, Illinois, Ohio, and Wisconsin.
What is Cluster Development?
Cluster Development also known as conservation development is a site planning approach that is an alternative to conventional subdivision development. It is a practice of Low Impact Development that groups residential properties in a proposed subdivision closer together in order to utilize the rest of the land for open space, recreation or agriculture. Cluster development differs from a planned unit development (PUD) due the fact that a PUD contains a mix of residential, commercial, industrial, or other uses, whereas the cluster development primarily focuses on residential area. 
Purpose.
The purpose of cluster development is to:
Benefits.
As mention before, the benefits of cluster development as opposed to a convention subdivision include: more preserved land for open/recreational space, a better setting for community building, possible local agriculture production, and an optimal arrangement in storm water management; furthermore cluster development makes more ecological and economical sense. 
By clustering residential properties there is less impervious surface and more natural drainage which reduces storm water flooding, and soil erosion. As well, strategic areas in the extra space can be used trap nutrients and suspend runoff. Economical benefits include having fewer roads, sewer/drainage, and electric/gas utility infrastructure to construct. Also higher density means reduced travel time for services as well as the possibility for public transportation, increased bicycle usage, and pedestrianism. This subsequently would mean less petroleum usage, and Co2 emission; as well, there is the possibility of having community-supported agriculture (CSA) which decreases food miles and supports local economy. Higher density also has implications for an increase in recreation and community.
Issues.
Following World War II, migration from the cities to suburbs became a dominant trend in America. People were acquiring any land they could find; as a result developers attempted to squeeze as many lots as they could on development sites. Communities then developed zoning regulations to limit the number of units and density allowed on a site. Though this zoning protected land for communities and to an extent preserved land from development, it was what ultimately led to the suburban sprawl as we know it today. It is this zoning that cluster development attempts to amend, and is the primary issue it faces.
Most municipalities have established zoning which restricts developers, planning boards and communities to only use this conventional subdivision development. Thus, the practice of traditional development is difficult to change due the set standard, familiarly of the procedure, and the fear of undertaking something new. In response to this, groups such as the American Planning Association have developed a model ordinance that provides the framework for cluster development. This ordinance is not difficult to administratively implement, though politically it is problematic due to conservative resistance.
People’s perception of personal space has a large part to do with this resistance. Many cases people chose to live in suburbs with the intention of having a large lot property; therefore it is hard to convince those individuals to live closer together. Convincing people to accept small lot sizes and higher density living remains one of the biggest obstacles of cluster development. This obstacle can be mostly overcome with proper site design that grants homes unobstructed views and effective private space. As well as educating people about the benefits of having better community and open space can serve as encouragement to change perceptions.
An additional obstacle to cluster development is the difficulty for creating small lot sizes when no municipal sewer system is in place. When septic systems are used, enough land needs to be available on each building lot for a leach field (sometimes land is required for two leach fields, the additional land set aside as a back-up). The amount of land needed is in proportion to the size of the septic system and the soil conditions, which must allow for the percolation of wastewater safely into the ground. In areas where well water is used, additional lot area may be required to sufficiently separate the well from the leach field. This can lead to minimum lot sizes of or more, making cluster development difficult. However, installing a package wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for the development (which acts as a small cluster plant, eliminating the need for individual septic tanks) or using biofilters with each septic system obviate the need for larger lot sizes. In addition, providing a package WWTP reduces the diameter and depth of collection sewer lines for the cluster, thus reducing the overall cost of infrastructure. 
The final primary issue with cluster development is the issue of dealing with open, recreational, and agricultural space. These areas do serve as benefits in many respects although they are also issues that are required to be dealt with. The maintenance of open and recreational space requires the formation of home owners associations that necessitate fees for taxes, insurance and general upkeep. This would not be necessary under a typical subdivision, though people would have their own maintenance expenses. As to agriculture: people enjoying living next to it until there is a need to apply fertilizer or pesticides. This fact cannot be avoided, though through the proper use of cluster development there can be wider gaps and barriers between agricultural land and residential properties, which would limit exposure to unwanted byproducts.
Application.
The model ordinance for cluster development is section 4.7 in the Smart Growth Codes, issued by the American Planning Association. Along with introducing the concept of cluster development, the ordinance outlines the process of application, site planning and implementation. 
The primary requisites for application of cluster development are that all principal or accessory uses are allowed and that multifamily dwelling, duplexes, and townhouses are permitted. As well the application of maximal lot coverage, floor area ratios, building height, and parking requirements to the entire site as opposed to the individual lot. Provisions of a cluster development require that the site is at least 2 to and there is no minimum to lot dimensions; furthermore each house can be no more than from the street with yard that is at least . There also needs to be the ability to place more than one principal building on each lot, and lastly no less than 25% of the site is used for open space. 
Included in the application, the site plan is required to consist of the street and sidewalk layout, the maximum number and type of dwelling units proposed, and how much area they will occupy, with calculations; as well as the area of parking, open space, and other accessories. To calculate the permitted amount of dwellings, one must measure the gross area of the site in acres and tenths of an acre, then subtract the gross area of the public and private streets and public dedicated improvement; the remainder will be the build able area. Then divide the net build able area by the smallest minimum lot size; round this number to the nearest lower number and the figure will be the maximum number of units.
Design Features.
There are various distinct design features in cluster development notably: the consideration of natural features/topography, smaller lot size, the use of cul-de-sacs, and the use of certain waste/storm water management techniques.
Along with site design, waste/storm water management design features are a principle aspect of cluster development. Through the maximizing of over land water flow and the strategic use of landforms and plants to slow, hold, and treat runoff it is possible to handle the majority of storm water. As well, there many options in dealing with waste water; techniques such as community drain fields, irrigation systems, and package plants can dramatically reduce the cost of infrastructure, and improve the environment.

Griffon 2000TD hovercraft

The Griffon 2000 series is a light-weight hovercraft built in the United Kingdom by Griffon Hoverwork and used principally by military and rescue organisations
Background.
Griffon Hoverwork (GHL) of Hythe, England has designed, manufactured and operated hovercraft for over 40 years.
GHL was the first manufacturer to use turbo-diesel engines on hovercraft, which increases durability compared to conventional gasoline engines when exposed to salt water conditions. The company produces an extensive range of hovercraft, with payloads between 0.38 and 12 tonnes.
Configuration.
The 2000 series was introduced in the early 1990s. The 2000TD series is slightly smaller than the older SR.N 6 hovercraft popular with commercial and military services during the 1970s, and has largely replaced the older SR.N6 series in most of these roles. Because it is constructed almost entirely out of aluminium the 2000TDX is less than half the weight of the older SR.N6 hovercraft.
The 2400TD was designed in 2008 due to the popularity of the 2000 series. It has greater obstacle clearance, is capable of carrying a higher payload and can reach higher speeds than the previous craft.
Commercial use.
Griffon Hoverwork have provided hovercraft to passenger services around the world, as hovercraft can provide a faster and more economical service than conventional ferries or catamarans. For 8 years GHL operated a passenger service up and down the River Thames in London, and hovercraft were the only vehicles allowed to operate at high speed along the river, as they produce very little wash or wake.
Hovertravel currently uses a Griffon Hoverwork designed BHT craft to provide a passenger route between Southsea, Portsmouth and Ryde, Isle of Wight.
Military use.
Griffon Hoverwork hovercraft have been purchased by several armies, navies and paramilitary organisations throughout the World, and several remain on order. The hovercraft can be configured to carry troops or cargo, with optional extras such as armoured glass and ballistic protection.

Khorchin Mongolian

The Khorchin (Mongolian "Qorčin", Chinese 科尔沁 "Kē'ěrqìn") dialect is a variety of Mongolian spoken in the east of Inner Mongolia, namely in Hinggan League, in the north, north-east and east of Hinggan and in all but the south of the Tongliao region. There were 2,08 million Khorchin Mongols in China in 2000, so the Khorchin dialect may well have more than one million speakers, making it the largest dialect of Inner Mongolia.
Phonology.
Khorchin has the consonant phonemes 
and the vowel phonemes 
The large vowel system hails from the depalatalization of consonants that left former allomorphic vowels as phonemes, hence and . On the other hand, *ö is absent, e.g. Proto-Mongolic > Kalmyk , Khalkha 'colour', but Khorchin , thus merging with . is absent in the native words of some varieties and is completely restricted to loanwords from Chinese, but as these make up a very substantial part of Khorchin vocabulary, it is not feasible to postulate a separate loanword phonology. This also resulted in a vowel harmony system that is rather different from Chakhar and Khalkha: may appear in non-initial syllables of words without regard for vowel harmony, as may (e.g. 'horses' and 'expensive'; Khalkha would have 'horses' and ). On the other hand, still determines a word as front-vocalic when appearing in the first syllable, which doesn't hold for and . In some subdialects, and which originated from palatalized and , have changed vowel harmony class according to their acoustic properties and become front vowels in the system, and the same holds for their long counterparts. E.g. *mori-bar 'by horse' > Khorchin vs. Jalaid subdialect .
On the consonant side, has been replaced by , and in some varieties, is replaced by . Then, *u (<*<*u) has regressively assimilated to before *p, e.g. *putaha (Written Mongolian budaγ-a) > pata ‘rice’. However, less systematic changes that pertain only to a number of words are far more notable, e.g. 'capacity'> Khorchin . This last example also illustrates that Khorchin allows for the consonant nuclei and (cp. 'many').
Morphology.
Khorchin uses the old comitative to delimit an action within a certain time. A similar function is fulfilled by the suffix that is, however, restricted to environments in the past stratum. In contrast to other Mongolian varieties, in Khorchin Chinese verbs can be directly borrowed; other varieties have to borrow Chinese verbs as Mongolian nouns and then derive these to verbs. Compare the new loan 'to ask for money' < zhāngluó (张罗) with the older loan 'to borrow' < jiè (借) that is present in all Mongolian varieties and contains the derivational suffix .

Julia Frankau

Julia Frankau, née Julia Davis (30 July 1859-17 March 1916) was a successful novelist who wrote under the name Frank Danby. Her first novel was published in 1887: "Dr. Phillips: A Maida Vale Idyll". Its portrayal of London Jews and Jewish life, and its discussion of euthenasia by a doctor were controversial. This was followed by more Frank Danby novels and by books on other subjects, including engraving, which were sometimes written under her own name. Frankau continued to write until the time of her death.
Biography.
Frankau's father was Hyman Davis (1824-1875), a London portrait photographer, though she and her older siblings were born in Dublin, where Davis practised as a dentist during the 1850s. On returning to London in the early 1860s, the Davis family lived first in Bruton Street before moving to Maida Vale.
She was a sister of the librettist Owen Hall (1853-1907) and the gossip columnist and fashion writer Mrs Aria (1861-1931). For a brief period during her early teens, she was home-tutored by Laura Lafargue, a daughter of Karl Marx. Another of her brothers, Harrie Davis, emigrated to New York, where he was employed as manager of the Gettysburg Cyclorama and also went on to pursue a journalistic career.
She married the London cigar importer Arthur Frankau (1849-1904) in 1883. They lived first at 103 Gloucester Terrace (London W), moving to 32a Weymouth Street in the later 1880s. Two of their three sons were author Gilbert Frankau (1884-1952) and actor Ronald Frankau (1894-1951) (thus Julia Frankau is grandmother of novelist Pamela Frankau and actress Rosemary Frankau, and great-grandmother of bibliographer Timothy d'Arch Smith and scriptwriter Sam Bain), and their daughter was the Cambridge don Joan Bennett (1896-1986), one of the "constellation of critics" called by the defence in the Lady Chatterley Trial. In this connection, it is interesting to note that Julia herself was credited by Mrs Belloc Lowndes with having been "one of the very few to recognise the genius of D. H. Lawrence". 
Julia's sister Florette married architect Marcus E. Collins in 1889, thus connecting the Davis and Frankau families with Arthur Collins of Drury Lane Theatre, theatrical manager Horace Collins, and stage director Frank Collins. Florette Collins published one novel in 1906, whereupon her sisters suggested she should content herself with being "the beauty of the family". The actor Henry Irving joined Arthur and Julia Frankau's family circle after Mrs Aria became his mistress in the 1890s.
During the 1890s, Julia Frankau began to research and write on engraving, ultimately publishing (under her own married name) three books on the subject. Her sister Eliza recalled: "having started a small collection of eighteenth-century engravings of mezzotint and stipple, she particularly favoured the English stipple colour prints, and because no book existed telling her what she wanted to know about them, she set to work and wrote one." After she returned to fiction – or, to use her own phrase, "relapsed into novel writing" – in 1902, "The Sketch" found "something quaint in the thought that Mrs Frankau – who, as 'Frank Danby', has recently published that brilliant study of contemporary manners (and morals), "Pigs in Clover" – should be, as she is without question, the greatest living authority on that daintiest product of the eighteenth century, the colour-print."
The commercial success of "Pigs in Clover", which coincided with a substantial inheritance from Arthur's late brother and business partner Edwin Frankau (1854-1903), permitted Arthur and Julia Frankau to move from Weymouth Street to 11 Clarges Street, as well as acquiring a seaside retreat named Clover Cottage (now 13 South Cliff, Eastbourne). Their Clarges Street house was said to have been occupied at one time by Emma, Lady Hamilton, thus providing inspiration for Frank Danby's "Story of Emma, Lady Hamilton".
Dr Phillips.
The first Frank Danby novel, originally published by Vizetelly in 1887, was a somewhat controversial social satire set in the affluent Jewish Maida Vale world where the author herself – "a Jewish girl from an Anglo-Jewish family of impeccable orthodoxy" – had grown up. "Punch" was said to have commented: "It should never have been written. Having been written, it should never have been published. Having been published, it should not be read."
"Dr Phillips" earned notoriety on two counts. "The Jews in Frankau's novel are repugnant. They are almost without exception uneducated, narrow, clannish, vulgar, materialistic, and tasteless." "Imagine the shock," recalled Horace Collins, "when it was discovered that the book contained characters with obvious likenesses to members of the family and cronies of my mother. Their idiosyncracies and weaknesses had been held up to ridicule with mordant wit and subtle irony. ... "Dr Phillips" was, in fact, in advance of the times and might be deemed to have been the precursor of the smart Society type of novel."
The second controversial aspect was the conduct of the eponymous doctor, who deliberately administers a lethal morphia overdose to his (German-Jewish) wife in the hope of being able to marry his (Gentile) mistress, the mother of his illegitimate daughter. It was bruited at the time of publication that the fictional Jewish Dr Phillips (named Dr Abrams in a pre-publication draft) was based on the real-life (Jewish) surgeon Ernest Abraham Hart, then editor of the "British Medical Journal", whose first wife had died by "accidental poisoning" in 1861. Mrs Aria insisted that "Dr Phillips" had "fluttered the dovecotes of Maida Vale, rattled the skeletons in the cupboards and the stout ladies at the card-tables, but never merited the popular suspicion that the hero was taken from life." On the other hand, Mrs Belloc Lowndes suggested that the characters in "Dr Phillips" had been more closely based on real-life individuals than those of any other Frank Danby novel, recalling particularly that the character of Dr Phillips "was supposed to have been drawn from a well-known doctor, and he must have felt the cap fitted his head, for he bought up and destroyed every copy he was able to procure."
"The scandal of "Dr Phillips" was compounded by publication the following year of Amy Levy's "Reuben Sachs" (1888). Levy was almost as harsh in her delineation of Jewish manners and morals, and the two works became linked in public discussion, the notoriety of each reinforcing that of the other."
Later novels.
Mrs Aria commented that "The Sphinx's Lawyer" was "written to defend the undefendable Oscar Wilde" – she and Frank Danby having both, through their brother Owen Hall, met Wilde in their youth. It is probably not accidental that "Sphinx" was Wilde's name for their mutual friend and fellow-writer Ada Leverson. "The Sphinx's Lawyer" was dedicated to Owen Hall who, according to its author, vehemently disapproved both the story and its subject matter. The printed dedication, addressed directly to her brother, fills a page and a half, insisting: "your harsh criticism has intensified my conviction of the righteousness of the cause I plead ... I have heard all your argument; I know where I stand. It is at the foot of the Throne of Mercy, with my client by my side, the client of the Sphinx's Lawyer. You, as well as I, know what he was in his brilliant youth, you, as well as I, know how weak he was in his strength, of what flawed physique and untoward inheritance. "Pity" was the one unsounded note in the chorus of execration that followed this poor leper to his grave, and beyond it; to awaken pity I have written."
"The Heart of a Child" (1908), a less controversial tale based on a storyline devised by Owen Hall, enjoyed great commercial success as a novel, was twice filmed as a motion picture, and rewritten in 1920 by Gilbert Frankau as a stage play – in which form it did not succeed, though Frankau noted that the novel itself was still earning royalties in the Summer of 1939. The heroine Sally Snape was played by Edna Flugrath in the first film version, Alla Nazimova in the second, and Renée Kelly in Gilbert Frankau's theatrical adaptation. Her most popular novel was "Joseph in Jeopardy" (1912). 
"Twilight" was a novel completed by Frank Danby on her deathbed, about a female author on her deathbed who is inspired to write about the death of a female author. The character of the ailing Jane Vevaseur is a semi-autobiographical portrayal of Julia Frankau, while her loving sister Eliza Aria is represented by the character of Ella Lovegrove. The title itself is a doubly resonant play on words – the dictum "Work whilst ye have the light" is quoted several times by the narrator, alluding to the fact that she (like Frank Danby) is running out of time; and it transpires that Dr Kennedy, Jane Vevaseur's medical attendant, brought about the death of writer Margaret Capel some years previously by deliberately administering a lethal overdose of what the narrator refers to as "hyoscine", a drug known in its day as "Twilight Sleep". Unlike the undetected murder in "Dr Phillips", however, this one is conducted with great reluctance at the patient's own poignant request.

Vezzana

The Vezzana (also Cima di Vezzana) is the highest peak in the Pale di San Martino, a mountain group in the Dolomites, northern Italy. It is located in the northern part of the Dolomites, between the Agordino and Primiero (provinces of Belluno and Trentino). It has an altitude of 3,192 metres.
The peak is flanked by that of the Cimon della Pala. It was first ascended in 1872 by Douglas William Freshfield and Charles Comyns Tucker, who reached it from the Travignolo glacier and the Passo di Travignolo. Unusual for the time, they climbed the summit without local guides, as these had declined to go further at reaching the glacier

<doc id="19822945" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19822945" title="Water resources management in the Dominican Republic">
Water resources management in the Dominican Republic

With surface water resources of 20 billion m3 (BCM) per year, of which 12 BCM are groundwater recharge, water resources in the Dominican Republic (DR) could be considered abundant. But irregular spatial and seasonal distribution, coupled with high consumption in irrigation and urban water supply, translates into water scarcity. Rapid economic growth and increased urbanization have also affected environmental quality and placed strains on the DR’s water resources base. In addition, the DR is exposed to a number of natural hazards, such as hurricanes, storms, floods, Drought, earthquakes, and fires. Global climate change is expected to induce permanent climate shocks to the Caribbean region, which will likely impact the DR in the form of sea level rise, higher surface air and sea temperatures, extreme weather events (such as tropical storms and hurricanes), increased rainfall intensity (leading to both more frequent and severe flooding) and more frequent and more severe "El Niño-like" conditions.
Water resources management in the country, in particular water quality, quantity and Watershed management faces major challenges today. Despite of the lack of systematic data limiting an accurate and detailed assessment of the scope of the problems, there is a consensus that: (i) the overall poor quality of surface, groundwater and coastal water resources is the result of a lack of waste water management and agricultural run-off, causing health problems that disproportionally affect the poor; (ii) water scarcity is a regional problem resulting from poor demand management in irrigation, urban water supply and tourist infrastructure in drier regions; (iii) weak watershed management leads to soil erosion and amplifies the damage and frequency of flooding; and (iv) the overall lack of solid waste management pollutes water sources, causes disease and is a nuisance for inhabitants and visitors alike. The DR government is in the process of reducing its role as main investor for water resources infrastructure and services provider decentralizing some responsibilities to local and regional government, water users organizations, and private companies.
Water management history and recent developments.
During the end of the 19th Century and 20th Century, DR Government was one of the main investor in the country’s hydraulic infrastructure development. Primarily focused on developing irrigation infrastructure in the fist three quarters of the past century, DR government invested on canal networks and irrigation technology increasing the area under irrigation from 32,000 hectares (ha) in the 1940s to 132,000 ha in 1954. In 1965, the DR Government created the National Institute for the Development of Water Resources (Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo de los Recursos Hidraulicos– INDRHI) responsible for planning the sustainable use of water resources and associated resources, as well as designing, formulating, executing, monitoring and evaluating projects, programs and actions aimed at controlling and regulating superficial and groundwater. Over the last three decades, the DR government has decentralized a number of responsibilities in the water sector to other institutions, such as operation and maintenance of infrastructure and water fee collection to irrigation districts and regional water and sewer companies. In addition, the electricity sector has been partially privatized in 1998-99, with hydropower remaining in public hands.
Tourism in the Dominican Republic.
Tourism is one of the main economic activities in the DR. Indeed, Tourism currently comprises 13% of GDP and contributes 29% of total export earning. In addition, tourism host more than 200 companies and employ 200,000 people. Tourism depends to a great extent on the quality of water resources and the coastal environment. However, the tourism industry is threatened by the deficiency of the water and sewerage services and the environmental pollution caused by inadequate management and disposal of sewage and solid waste.
On the other hand, tourism has an impact on DR’s water resources and environment. WRM issues associated with tourism include: dumping of untreated waste water and solid waste along the coast, overexploitation of groundwater, destruction of forest cover, and overfishing of coral reef and marine species.
Water resource base.
Surface and groundwater resources.
The DR’s internal water resources per capita is 2,430 cubic meters, which is below the average for Central American and the Caribbean region, 6,645. Current water demand of 10 billion m3 represents 44 percent of total available freshwater resources. According to the World Bank only Barbados, the DR, Mexico, and Peru exceed 10 percent demand in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Water scarcity is reflected in increasing competition for surface water allocation and unsustainable groundwater abstraction. 
"Source": FAO
(1)Total run off including superficial and groundwater run off.
(2)Enriquillo Lake’s run off is included in the Caribbean watershed total run off
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), groundwater has a potential of 1,500 million m3/year, but less than a third of this value is actually being extracted. Although coastal limestone aquifers contain only about 4 percent of the available groundwater reserves, human activities in the southeast of the country (from Santo Domingo to La Romana and Punta Cana) are heavily dependent on them – for example, some 30 percent of Santo Domingo’s water supply comes from underground sources. As a result, coastal limestone aquifers are overdrafted and seawater intrusion already reaches inland 20 to 50 km from the seashore. Many coastal aquifers are at risk of contamination from agrochemicals and poorly located solid waste disposal, contributing to water scarcity by making resources unavailable.
Storage capacity and infrastructure.
According to FAO, Dominican Republic dams’ storage capacity is 2,144 million m3, 85 percent of which is stored in reservoirs behind large dams (those whose capacity exceeds 100 million m3). Most large reservoirs store water for multiple purposes (drinking water supply, flood control, irrigation and hydroelectric).
The largest reservoirs in the country are Hatillo (700 million m3) in the Yuna River, Sabana Yegua (560 million m3) in the Yaque del Sur River, Bao (244 million m3) in the Bao river and Jiguey (169 million m3) and Valdesía (137 million m3), both in the Nizao River.
Water quality.
Although few studies on water quality have been carried out over the last two decades and there is a crucial lack of adequate and consistent monitoring, scattered evidence suggests that the levels of nutrients, organic matter, and bacteriological contamination in water are high. For example, the proportion of samples with coliforms in aqueducts served by INAPA (the main water company, supplying 40 percent of the population) increased from 17 percent in 1994 to 23 percent in 1998. This is particularly striking because according to DR standards, presence of coliforms in more than 5 percent of samples indicates that water is no longer potable.
Water pollution is largely the product of poor urban wastewater management but solid waste and agriculture are also water polluters. In some cases, high salinity, pesticides and other pollutants are present in water close to agricultural, urban, and industrial areas. Downstream of metal mining, flows of effluents also show high levels of cadmium, chrome and other heavy metals – high levels of mercury have been found in the waters of Samana Bay and the presence of pesticides and persistent organic pollutants (such as DDT and PCBs) in estuary mollusks has also been reported.
Water resources management by sector.
Drinking water and sanitation.
The DR has achieved impressive increases in access to water supply and sanitation over the past two decades. However, the quality of water supply and sanitation services remains poor, despite the country’s high economic growth during the 1990s. The DR, with a population of 8.8 million, of which about 60% are located in urban areas, has a high level of water services in urban areas with 97% coverage and 92% of the urban population with household connections (as compared to an average of 90% in the LAC region).
"Source": WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (2006). (Water and sanitation based on Dominican Republic Demographic and Health Survey (2002). The Joint Monitoring Program data do not mention the 2002 census as a source. According to the census, as quoted in Uriana Abreu, Slide 15, coverage for sanitation (broad definition) was 93% (96% in urban areas and 88% in rural areas). These higher coverage figures may be due to a broader definition of improved sanitation in the census compared to the Demographic and Health Survey used as a source by the JMP) 
There are substantial regional differences in coverage. For example, in nine provinces located in the Central, Northeastern and Eastern part of the country less than 70% of the population had access to an improved source of water supply according to the 2002 census.
Poor households exhibit lower levels of access: only 56% of poor households are connected to water house connections as opposed to 80% of non-poor households. Just 20% of poor households have access to sewers, as opposed to 50% for the non-poor.
Irrigation and drainage.
About 76% of Dominican Republic’s land area (8,900 km2) is dedicated to agriculture, 17% of which is irrigated. According to FAO, 270,000ha are equipped for irrigation. INDRHI estimates the area suitable for irrigation at up to 710,000 ha, taking into account soil suitability and water resources availability. Most of the irrigated areas are located in the valleys between the mountain ranges, with a medium to low rainfall and few limitations on its soil such as slope, depth of soil, and in some cases, salinity problems associated with irrigation or the presence of saline groundwater. 
Needs in the irrigation subsector are related to improving efficiency, productivity and
organizational aspects. According to the FAO, solutions should be sought in the use of better technology, efficient operation of irrigation systems and adequate means of financial support. Poor maintenance of existing infrastructure and irrational use of water are causes for the low (overall) irrigation efficiency.
Irrigation Management Transfer to Water Users Associations (WUAs), formally started in the mid 1980s, is still an on-going process showing positive signs with irrigation systems in 127,749 ha (46% of total irrigated land in the country), being managed by 41,329 users (57% of all users). However, the transfer process and the performance of WUAs are still far from ideal. While WUAs show a significant increase in cost recovery, especially when compared to low values in areas under state management, a high subsidy from the government still contributes to cover operation and maintenance costs in their systems.
Hydropower.
In 2008 the DR had an installed hydroelectric capacity of 470 MW, accounting for 14% of electricity generating capacity. It is expected that, by 2012, an additional 762MW will have been added. The first three new hydropower plants, with a combined capacity of 240MW, are:
The two first plants were under construction in 2008.
The detailed share for the different sources is as follows: 
"Source": Electricity Superintendence Statistics, 2006
Legal and institutional framework.
Legal framework.
The present Water Law, No. 5852 passed in 1962 and modified by laws 281, 238, and 431, established the main aspects of the legal framework for water resources management in the DR, including: (i) water as a public domain (meaning that ownership of water either resides with land owners or is public), (ii) water use concessions system, (iii) priorization of municipal water use, (iv) pollution of water ban, and (v) participation of users in water resources management. The Water Law ties water rights to land ownership or public service providers and establish a limited private property right of water, only for water originating in owner's land such as springs and rain water.
In addition, Law No. 6 of 1965 created the National Institute for Water Resources (INDRHI), the national water authority, assigning it functions at three levels: (i) policy development and planning at the constitutional (normative) level; (ii) water rights administration, regulation enforcement and hydrological services at the organizational level; and (iii) water use for the irrigation system at the operational level.
Institutional framework.
The Dominican Water Resource Institute – INDRHI, under the Ministry of the Environment, is responsible for managing water and related resources as well as designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating programs, projects and activities aimed at controlling and regulating surface and groundwater use. INDRHI collaborates with other sectoral institutions such as: (i) the State Secretariat for Agriculture and the Dominican Agriculture Institute, (ii) the Water Supply and Sanitation "Institute" INAPA, a utility operating in small towns and rural areas, and regional water and sanitation utilities in the cities of Santo Domingo, Santiago, Moca, Puerto Plata and Romana, (iii) the Ministry of Public Health, and (iv) the Dominican Electricity Corporation.
Government strategy.
DR’s government is in the process of designing a new legal and institutional framework for water resources management. In particular, the government is drafting a new General Water Law and Water Supply and Sanitation Law after various previous attempts. The development of the legal and institutional framework for integrated water resources management will depend greatly on these laws.
International agreements.
The Dominican Republic and Haiti signed the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Arbitration on 20 February 1929, which included an agreement on the border definition and the water sharing of several rivers such as the Artibonite River, Pedernalis and Massacre rivers. Both parties agreed not to construct any works that would change the course or flow of any shared rivers.
The basin is managed by the ‘Service des Ressources en Eau’ (SNRE) in Haiti and by the ‘Instituto Nacional de Recursos Hídricos’ (INDRHI) in the Dominican Republic. Both entities are endowed with capable human resources although financial means are scarce, especially in Haiti. Basin disputes have mostly taken root because of complex economic, social and political reasons, rather than because of a lack of support or coordination by both technical areas.
Financial aspects.
Water users fees.
According to FAO, water fees are too low to meet maintenance and operation requirements for hydraulic infrastructure. For instance, cost recovery for water and sanitation is minimal. Average tariffs are moderate at US$ 0.21 per cubic meter for water and US$ 0.07 per cubic meter for sewerage. In addition, collection rates for water supply and sanitation are extremely low at only 28%. As a result of moderate tariffs and very low collection rates, according to a WHO estimate in 1998, households paid on average only US$ 0.50 per month for water and US$ 0.09 per month for sewerage. Not surprisingly, the regional water and sewer companies and INAPA (the national water and sewerage authority) rely largely on transfers from the central budget to fund their operations. The existing schemes lack transparency and efficiency in the use of subsidies.
The situation is similar for irrigation services were annual fees varies from US
$4.75/ha in some regions to US$24/ha in other regions. Water costs for a farmer only represent 0.21 to 0.58% of total production cost. Operation and Maintenance expenditure in INDRHI’s Irrigation Districts for 1997 was US$6.24 million (average U.S. $35/ha.) while returns (income for water fees) was only 13.8% of this value.
Investment.
According to FAO, annual government investment in water resources and irrigation infrastructure is in the order of US $100 million.
INDRHI’s budget in 2001 was RD$930 million (about US$26 million), which was mainly focused on irrigation works despite INDRHI responsibilities for other water resources management responsibilities such as water quality and groundwater management.
Environmental issues.
Water related risks.
Upper watershed degradation, primarily in the form of soil erosion, has significant downstream impacts. Erosion rates have been estimated at four times those of 1980. Across the DR sedimentation has reduced reservoir capacity by some 10-25 percent, with important economic impacts for the hydropower industry (assuming a loss of hydropower generation of a mere 20 percent, the cost of dam siltation only in hydropower generation lost would exceed US$10 million per year). In addition, watershed degradation increases the costs of maintaining other water systems, such as irrigation channels and water supply infrastructure, and it affects coastal water quality. High turbidity from land-based sediments prevents reefs from forming in most of the Dominican coast.
The DR is exposed to a number of natural hazards, such as hurricanes, storms, floods, drought, earthquakes, and fires. The destructive force of these phenomena can be enormous - in 1998 Hurricane Georges caused economic losses estimated at US$2,193 (14 percent of GNI), and 235 deaths. In particular, climate shocks have included a dramatic increase in the frequency of major weather events over the past forty years, with 491 recorded major weather events during the previous decade, as compared to 126 from 1960 to 1969. Flooding has emerged as the most common recorded disaster during the 1990s, replacing fires for the first time in nearly fifty years. Alarmingly, flooding is mostly due to non-extreme weather events. Out of the recorded 464 major flooding events between 1966 and 2000, only 33 were caused by hurricanes or tropical storms, while the overwhelming majority of flooding was caused by precipitation during the rainy season.
Potential climate change impacts.
Global climate change is expected to induce permanent climate shocks to the Caribbean region, which will include sea level rise, higher surface air and sea temperatures, extreme weather events (such as tropical storms and hurricanes), and more frequent and more severe "El Niño-like" conditions. Demographic growth accelerated environmental degradation, deforestation, and lack of mitigation measures will intensify the impact of disasters in the future.
In terms of Climate Change impacts on water resources, and according to DR’s first communication, it is expected a great decrease in spatial distribution of rainfall, and total runoff for the year 2100, demonstrating a structural change that intensifies the transition from the most humid zones to the driest and an expansion of the areas of the country that are historically the driest.
Ongoing programs and initiatives.
In May 2008 the World Bank has approved a US$80 million loan to restore and strengthen irrigation, electricity, water, and sanitation infrastructure damaged by Tropical Storms Olga and Noel, enhance critical infrastructure to reduce future storm-related impacts, and strengthen basic capacity for future risk management in INDRHI and CDEEE.

Beethoven's Big Break

"Beethoven's Big Break (formerly known as Beethoven: The Reel Story and sometimes referred to as Beethoven's 6th") is the sixth installment in the Beethoven film series. It was released on DVD on December 26, 2008. The film was rated PG by the MPAA for some mild rude humor, being the first "Beethoven" film to be rated PG by the MPAA since 1993's "Beethoven's 2nd". The film is also considered to be a reboot of the series, or a stand alone film, as it completely disregards all storylines from the previous five films.
Plot.
Eddie Bob, a struggling animal trainer and widower dad, is an assistant animal trainer to Sal DeMarco, an untalented, egocentric animal show host. Both men have been hired to train the animals for a film called "Frizzy, The Bichon Frise": Sal as the dog handler, and Eddie is given only the responsibility of training the lizard. When Frizzy is kidnapped, Sal quickly claims that Eddie was responsible for the dog handling. Eddie is promptly fired. The director refuses to pay the ransom and decides to instead hold auditions for the new Frizzy.
Meanwhile, Eddie's son, Billy Bob, is walking around town when he discovers a large, stray dog is following him. Billy then brings the dog home and names him Beethoven after the dog shows interest in Ludwig van Beethoven's 5th symphony, after initially trying to call him Wolfgang. Eddie comes home to discover that, not only is his job gone, but now his house is wrecked by an oversized dog adopted by his son.
Will soon learns that the one responsible for Frizzy's disappearance is Sal, accompanied by his two other cronies. He admonishes them for not waiting until Frizzy had already shot "some" of the movie, in order to make her valuable.
The next day, when auditions are held, the director has trouble finding the right dog to replace Frizzy. Eddie has arrived (with Billy and Beethoven in-tow) to pick up his lizard, Pete. Suddenly, Beethoven bursts in and performs an impressive chase scene with Pete the Lizard, which instantly makes the director love him. Beethoven and Eddie are hired on the spot, and Sal is sacked.
To celebrate, Eddie takes Billy and Beethoven out for hamburgers, but Beethoven escapes with the burgers and leads Eddie and Billy on a chase. Finally, they find where Beethoven was going: he had been caring for his three small pups in an alley, as their mother had apparently died. In "Beethoven's 2nd", she wasn't heard from again. Eddie begrudgingly adopts the puppies, as well.
Eddie is then charged with having Beethoven perform the requested stunts in the movie. Unfortunately, Beethoven proves to be "untrainable", and instead, often crashes through the scene and making a sloppy mess in the process. Each time, Eddie is prepared to be fired, but the director finds these scenes even more funny and orders the scenes printed for the film. Lisa, the film's writer, requests from Eddie to spend more time with Beethoven so that she can write more appropriately for him.
As revenge for being fired, Sal orders his henchmen to kidnap Beethoven for the million-dollar ransom, planning to kill him after the ransom is paid. They kidnap him while Billy is flirting with his crush in the park. Eddie, Billy, Lisa, and the puppies then head to Sal's show stage, which doubles as his secret lair, and rescue Beethoven. Sal and his goons are arrested, and Eddie and Lisa begin a relationship.
The film ends with Eddie, Lisa, Billy, Katie, Beethoven, the pups, and Pete the iguana, all enjoying snacks while watching the film's premiere.
The end credits have movie title parodies. These include Dog-E, When Hairy Met Frizzy and The Lizard of Oz. During the Gag Reel, Jonathan Silverman refers to Sal DeMarco as "Ned Ryerson". This is because the actor who played Sal, Stephen Tobolowsky, portrayed the character Ned Ryerson in the Bill Murray comedy, Groundhog Day.
Sequel.
A sequel, "Beethoven's Christmas Adventure", was released in 2011.

Indrabhuti Gautama

Gautam Swami was the chief disciple of Lord Mahavira, the 24th Jain Tirthankara. He was a Ganadhara. His real name was Indrabhuti Gautam, but he is after referred to as Gautama because that was his gotra. He was born in the Gochchar village in the Magadh kingdom to a Brahmin couple Vasubhuti and Prithvi. Diwali marks the day when Mahavira attained Nirvana and Gautam Swami obtained the kevalajnana. He had 500 students studying with him while he was conducting a yajna at Madhyam Pava. Lord Mahavira, after having attained kevalajnana, came to Vipula hill just outside the capital Rajagriha of King Shrenika. According to the tradition he was awaiting suitable disciples before commencing his public teachings.
According to Shatkhandagama the digambar scripture, the Indra, pretending to be a medicant, approached Indrabhuti. The Indra asked him to explain the meaning of a verse:
पंचेव अत्थिकाया छज्जीव णिकाया महव्वया पंच|<br>
When he was unable to explain the verse, the Indra advised him to visit the samosharana of Lord Mahavira so that he can learn the meaning of the verse. As he was approaching the set of Lord Mahavira at his gandhakuti, he saw the lofty manastambha (the column of pride). Seeing the manastambha, his pride vanished and he was filled with humility. He became the chief disciple of Lord Mahavira at the age of 50. The day he took diksha is celebrated as Guru Purnima. His brothers Agnibhuti and Vayubhuti, both scholars of distinction, also became Ganadharas of Lord Mahavira. He obtained salvation in Nawada.
According to Shwetambar scripture Kalpasutra,Indrabhuti the great Brahman was preparing for yagna (a holy sacrifice) along with his 500 disciples which included his learned brothers Agnibhuti and Vayubhuti. He was so learned and spiritually powerful person that when ever he performed a yagna Indra along with other devi-devtas would attend the same. The same was aught to happen this time too, Indrabhuti observes the devi-devtas arriving from the sky in their divine vehicles, but to his shock neither of them stopped at his ashram [hermitage but passed over it without even giving an eye to Indrabhuti. This hurt Indrabhuti's ego making him think that who suddenly became more powerful than he was. He decided to follow the vehicles of devtas to reach that person and challenge him for a shastrarth debate and defeat him. But little did he know that his life was going to change forever. Indrabhuti reaches the place where the devtas stopped and climbed a beautiful Samvosaran of Lord Mahavir. Indrabhuti's ego melted away at the sight of the Manasthambha and his curiosity rose to see the person inside the Samvosaran. By then all his 500 disciples reached there after him. Indrabhuti started climbing the steps of Samvosaran. Each step he climbed his ego melted and finally he sees the face of the person he wanted to defeat - it was Lord Mahavir. Seeing the divine face his ego melted completely and he thought "what a divine face, how calm and pure his expressions are. How mature but at the same time innocent his face is" but before he completed his thought Lord Mahavir called him "Goyama" [Gautama, leaving a surprise in Indrabhuti's mind that how does he know him and his Gotra, but before he could he react Lord said "being a learned Brahman why still do you doubt the existence of the atman . "Now this came as a shock to indrabhuti as this indeed was his doubt and he had not shared it with any one yet, Lord continued and cleared his doubt by reciting a shloka from the upanishads itself and similarly he cleared the doubts of Agnibhuti and Vayubhuti. Indrabhuti along with his 500 disciples became so dispassioned that they asked Lord to give them Diksha and become ascetics to which Lord obliged and made them his disciples, and Indrabhuti was then known as Gautam swami.
The Jain Monastic Lineages.
After Lord Mahavira, the lineage (Pattavali)is traced as follows according to Sravana Belgola AD 600 inscription, Harivansha Purana, Jambuddvita Pannati and Kalpasutra. Bhadrabahu was the last leader of the undivided Sangha. After him there were two branches in the lineage. In both branches, some of the oral tradition was gradually lost. The two branches eventually became the two traditions Digambaras and the Svetambaras, although formal recognition of the separation is encountered in the 5th century CE. Kalpasutra gives a lineage starting with Pushyagiri after Vajrasena ending with Kshamashramna Devarddhi, the president of the Vallabhi council. The canonical books of the Svetambaras were produced in writing in this Council. The Kalpasutra also mentions ganas and shakhas established by other disciples of Bhadrabahu, Sambhutavijaya, Mahagiri etc. The Brihat-Kharataragachchha pattavali gives the name of Chandra after Vajrasena, the lineage continues until Udyotana, the founder of Brihadgachcha.
The Lineages after Bhadrabahu.
According to Digambar tradition, the monastic lineage after bhadrabahu was:
Arhadvali is said to have been the founder of the for divisions of the Mula Sangha.
The lineage from Bhadrabahu according to Svetambara tradition is:

Rezai family

Prior to the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the Rezai family was one of the richest and most powerful families in Iran. The four brothers, Ali, Mahmood, Abbas and Ghassem used their savvy, and a small inheritance from their father who had died when Ghassem, the youngest of the brothers was only 40 days old, to build one of the biggest business empires in Iran if not the Middle East at the time. The businesses were largely based on "theaters, tobacco and mining". Ali Rezai, the oldest of the brothers, focused on a steel mill, while Mahmood developed mining interests—initially mining chromium in the Khorasan desert, and using his success to develop the Sarcheshmeh copper mine. Their various business successes meant that by 1975 they employed over 8,000 people, and had an annual turnover of $300 million.
Politically, they had backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and Ali Rezai became a senator in the Majlis of Iran in 1975.
As the monarchy fell in 1979, because of their vast fortune and ties to the Royal family, the Rezai's had to go into exile. Ali fled by air, and, by various means, all the family members "escaped to New York City, Houston, Los Angeles and Costa Rica" by 1980.

Hopper Field is a stadium located in Freeport, Texas on the campus of Brazosport High School at the east banks of the Brazos River. It is currently home to the high school football teams of the Brazosport Independent School District (BISD), and seats 10,478. It was named in honor of Brazosport High School coach Herbert Eugene Hopper who had served in that position since 1927.

History.
Hopper Field opened on September 16, 1949 with a game between Brazosport High School and St. Thomas High School of Houston. During the first season of use, stadium lights were blown down due to high winds caused by the 1949 Texas hurricane, and night games were no longer possible until their repair. Originally seating 6,400, Hopper Field's capacity was expanded to 8,662 in 1961. In 2004, an artificial turf known as "Momentum Turf" by Sportexe was installed, among other renovations.

List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Washington University in St. Louis

The Nobel Prizes are awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Karolinska Institute, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to individuals who make outstanding contributions in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. Another prize, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for contributors to the field of economics. Each prize is awarded by a separate committee; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics, the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a cash prize that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, the winners of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. In 2008, the winners were awarded a prize amount of 10,000,000 SEK. The awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.

The Colm &amp; Jim-Jim Breakfast Show

The Colm & Jim-Jim Breakfast Show was an Irish breakfast radio show, broadcast weekdays on RTÉ 2fm. The show, hosted by Colm Hayes and Jim-Jim Nugent, began broadcasting in March 2007 when the duo moved from rival station FM104. 
"The Colm & Jim-Jim Breakfast Show" was on air from 06:00 - 09:00, Mon-Fri, directly before 2fm's flagship show, "The Gerry Ryan Show". It placed sixteenth in a survey of national radio listenership figures taken between June 2007 and June 2008, with 202,000 adult listeners. The show is in direct competition with "The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show" which airs on Today FM, and placed 12th in the same survey. Each Saturday morning a compilation of "best bits" from the previous week was broadcast between 09:00 and 10:00. "The Colm & Jim-Jim Breakfast Show" was Ireland's third (3rd) most popular podcast in 2007, with 601,203 downloads. In 2008, "The Colm & Jim-Jim Breakfast Show"'s listenership figures were reduced by 5,000 to 197,000.
Transfer from FM104.
Change in listenership.
The move from FM104 represented a change in listenership for Hayes and Nugent as 2fm broadcasts nationally whilst FM104 reaches only listeners in Dublin.
Naming rights.
In initial promotional material, the new breakfast show was referred to as the "2fm Alarm Clock" in reference to the duo's previous show "The Strawberry Alarm Clock". However when FM104 threatened legal action the name was dropped in favour of the current moniker.
Previous 2fm breakfast shows.
The duo's new slot led to the axing of "Orla Rapple's Early Show" and replaced "Marty in the Morning" in the 2fm breakfast slot. Since Ryan Tubridy left "The Full Irish" and defected to RTÉ Radio One, the station had struggled to replace him in a difficult period which also saw the short-lived "The Rick & Ruth Breakfast Show" axed after six months due to declining listenership figures. Prior to this difficulties arose when 2fm's breakfast host, Ian Dempsey moved to Today FM. He now presents a rival breakfast show with the commercial station.
The 2fm show.
Overview.
"The Colm & Jim-Jim Breakfast Show" was launched with sponsors Halifax. In 2007, "The Colm and Jim-Jim Breakfast Show" added 100,000 new listeners to their breakfast show. Whilst on 2fm the duo won an RTÉ Guide Award for "Favourite Radio Show", following the seven PPI Awards they earned whilst working on "104's Strawberry Alarm Clock" for FM 104. Nugent spoke of the strictness that was rife at his now NEW workplace: "You know when we left 104 they wouldn't let us take our awards with us. I had to sneak in at six in the morning, take them out of the cabinet and put them all on a table together and take a picture of them and stick it on my blog. It was up there for ages before they realised we were leaving." By September 2008, an additional 24,000 listeners had been added.
Controversies.
Obama sniper assassination controversy.
The pair were heavily criticised for mocking Barack Obama on 20 January 2009, including suggestions that the forty-fourth President of the United States would be shot by snipers during his inauguration ceremony. In the build-up to the inauguration they laughed and made jokes on air about the President-elect having to avoid snipers by doing the locomotion on stage. Describing how the transfer of power would take place in a matter of seconds, Hayes said: Nugent quickly replied but later proceeded to join in the joke as Hayes continued: Nugent commented: Hayes continued: The two presenters laughed at this and Nugent claimed: At that point they began to cheer and sing the locomotion, adding in the line "keep moving Obama". Finally Hayes referred to the removal of Obama's predecessor George W. Bush: 
Mikey Graham incident.
RTÉ was forced to air an apology at 21:30 on 21 August 2009 for "allowing coarse and offensive language to be used" on "The Colm & Jim-Jim Breakfast Show" during a discussion about Boyzone singer Mikey Graham.
Regular features.
Jim-Jim's Dad.
"Jim's Dad" is a game in which Nugent's father gives a new cryptic clue each Monday. Listeners are invited to call the show and submit their guesses - three are granted to the listenership per day - and they will be deemed correct or false. If false Nugent's father will express his disapproval. The prize is a minimum of €50, a further sum of that amount is added each day. The first two clues were: "It's something I own, I'd say most families have one." The second clue was: "I keep mine in the house". The kitty is currently €1400.
Kids Go Crazy in the Car.
At 08:25, Hayes and Nugent phone a child who is usually in a car on their way to school. The child is asked to do something impossible to tell on radio, i.e. stand on their head.
One More Song Before I Get Up.
"One More Song Before I Get Up" is one more song before the listeners arise from their nightly slumber. It generally occurs around 06:40 each day.
The Pop Quiz.
"The Pop Quiz" is a best of three phone-in competition in which Hayes plays directly against a caller. Nugent plays three songs, during which after each both the title and artist must be correctly guessed by Hayes or the competitor. If they answer wrongly they are frozen out.
Roll Call.
Each Monday Colm and Jim-Jim take a call with a class representative and grant said person 30 seconds to list off everyone on their class roll and say hello to their friends. They then win a Colm and Jim-Jim schoolbag.
Telly Bits.
"Telly Bits" is an 8-10 minute slot occurring after the 07:00 news update at approximately 07:10 during which Lindy, Colm and Jim-Jim discuss that evening's television highlights.

It took them a few minutes to get him to respect their wish and take off his shoes.
While the father was in Japan he found out many things he never knew about his son. For one, his son was married to a Japanese woman and they had a child together. The father and his son clearly did not share a strong, loving and respectful relationship. In one scene, The two got in a fight and the father kicked the son out of the home.

Maybe This Christmas Too?

Maybe This Christmas Too? is a holiday compilation album released in October 2003 through Nettwerk Records featuring contemporary musicians performing both classic and original Christmas songs. The compilation served as a sequel to "Maybe This Christmas" (2002) and preceded "Maybe This Christmas Tree" (2004). A portion of the proceeds from the album went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. Critical reception of the compilation, which failed to chart in any nation, was mixed.
Background and composition.
"Maybe This Christmas Too?" is a sequel to the 2002 compilation album "Maybe This Christmas", which reached a peak position of number thirty-eight on "Billboard" Top Holiday Albums chart. "Maybe This Christmas Tree", released in 2004, became the third installment to the series. A portion of proceeds from all three albums went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. "Maybe This Christmas Too?" features fourteen tracks recorded by various artists, most of which were associated with the Nettwerk record label during its release. Ten of the tracks were recorded specifically for this compilation album. Darin Harmon served as the album's executive producer and Ianthe Zevos served as the project manager. Mastering for the compilation was donated by Louie Teran. In August 2003, MTV reported on the possible inclusions of The Used's "Alone This Holiday", The Flaming Lips' "Winter Wonderland" and The Polyphonic Spree's "Winter Wonderslumber", none of which ended up on the final release.
The album opens with Rufus Wainwright's "Spotlight on Christmas", an acoustic-based original track recorded exclusively for this set. "Spotlight on Christmas" was written and produced by Wainwright; among other guests, the song features Teddy Thompson and Martha Wainwright on backing vocals and bells as well as Thompson on electric guitar. "The Winter Song" was written, arranged and produced by members of Eisley. "O Holy Night", based on a poem by Placide Cappeau, was composed by Adolphe Adam and translated by John Sullivan Dwight. The song is performed by Avril Lavigne and Chantal Kreviazuk, the latter of which also produced the track. "Silent Night", performed by Lisa Hannigan, was originally recorded by Damien Rice for his 2002 studio album "O". The song is less than two minutes in length and features original lyrics.
The band Rilo Kiley contributed "Xmas Cake", a song originally written by group members Jenny Lewis and Blake Sennett. The track was produced and mixed by Mike Mogis and features "jazzy guitar chords and a piano-led wintery feel" to address poverty and conflict. "¿Dónde Está Santa Claus?" (Spanish for "Where Is Santa Claus?") is performed by the band Guster and was produced, recorded and mixed by Peter Katis. The track contains castanets, "bouncing" rhythm, and "silky" backing vocals. "Rudy", a song about "Rudolf the red-nosed wino", was originally written by Danny Dolinger; the version appearing on the compilation album was arranged and performed by The Be Good Tanyas. Instrumentation included guitar, mandolin, organ, piano, percussion and the twelve-string guitar. "Christmas Song" was written by Dave Matthews and performed by the Dave Matthews Band. The "organ-tinged, gospel rendition" of "Go Tell It on the Mountain", originally written by John Wesley Work, Jr. with traditional music, was arranged and given additional lyrics by Suzie Ungerleider (also known as Oh Susanna).
The Barenaked Ladies' "Green Christmas", a song credited to Steven Page and Ed Robertson about experiencing Christmas in a location where snow never falls, was originally recorded for the soundtrack to the 2000 film "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". The acoustic studio version that appeared on "Maybe This Christmas Too?" differed from the soundtrack version as well as a third version appearing on the band's 2004 studio album "Barenaked for the Holidays". Martina Sorbara performs a "vampish, bluesy" rendition of Edward Pola and George Wyle's "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year". The track was produced and recorded by David Matheson. "Donna & Blitzen" was written and performed by Badly Drawn Boy and features "bouncy vintage rock piano". Irving Berlin's "White Christmas" is performed by The Flaming Lips. Sixpence None the Richer performs "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear", the album's final track. The song contains music by Richard Storrs Willis and lyrics by Edmund Hamilton. The version was arranged by Matt Slocum, produced by Sam Ashworth and Taylor Harris, and engineered and mixed by Harris. Leigh Nash performs vocals, Slocum features on guitar, pedal steel and Wurlitzer, Rob Mitchell plays drums, and Justin Cary plays bass. Ashworth also contributed on ebowuitar and percussion, and Harris on percussion and programming.
Reception.
Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson wrote that "Maybe This Christmas Too?" would appeal to "both casual and die-hard music fans of all ages". Wilson called Wainwright's performance "classic chamber pop with a warm spirit" and also noted the "fetching" graphic design work for the album's cover art by Brian "Goatpillow" Brooks of Cosmic Debris. Andrew Gilstrap's review for PopMatters also complimented "Spotlight on Christmas", calling the song a "clever piece of class-conscious commentary" that provides a "perfect example of [Wainwright's] meticulous toyshop brand of pop". Simmy Richman of "The Independent" considered The Flaming Lips' rendition of "White Christmas" to be the "strangest" he had ever heard. Gilstrap used the same adjective ("strange") to describe "O Holy Night", and thought "Silent Night" was "incredibly potent" despite its short length. "The New York Times" Kelefa Sanneh called "White Christmas" "spooky" and wrote that the album "brings to the world something more ambivalent than joy". Gilbert concluded that "Maybe This Christmas Too?" "feels just about right" and "does a fine job of representing the less than stellar aspects of a wintry, commercialized holiday like Christmas." In 2008 "The A.V. Club" included "Spotlight on Christmas" as number thirty-nine on its list of "42 holiday entertainments that don't make us want to claw our eyes out with rage".

Inverted Sourcing

Inverted Sourcing is a price volatility reduction procurement strategy usually conducted by procurement or supply-chain person by which the value of an organization's waste-stream is maximized by actively seeking out the highest price possible from a range of potential buyers, exploiting price trends and other market factors. This technique is used by organizations as a source of alternative income generation, and also as an offset to reduce the net impact of front-end acquisition pricing, thereby reducing exposure to price volatility for a given sourcing category.

Tom Sloan (footballer born 1959)

Thomas "Tom" Sloan (born 10 July 1959), also known as Tommy Sloan, is a Northern Irish ex-footballer who played as a midfielder in both Northern Ireland and England in the late 1970s, the 1980s and even the early 1990s.
Born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Sloan began his football career with his local club, Ballymena United. In 1978, he was part of the Ballymena United team that reached the final of the Irish Cup only to lose to Linfield. His role as a key player in that team earned him a selection for the Northern Irish under-21 team for a match against the Republic of Ireland.
That summer, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur were locked in a battle for Sloan's signature, but it was United who eventually won out, paying Ballymena United £20,000 for the transfer. Sloan's influence in the heart of the United midfield was not sufficient for him to earn a regular place in the team, but his four appearances in his first season at Old Trafford were enough to attract a call from the Northern Irish senior team at the end of the season. In the space of 15 days, Sloan won his only three caps; two came in the 1979 British Home Championship, against Scotland and Wales, while the other was a UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying match against Denmark.
Sloan's involvement with the Manchester United first team gradually decreased over the next three seasons – he made just eight appearances in total in 1979–80 and 1980–81, and none at all in 1981–82 – and he was released to Chester City in July 1982. At Chester, Sloan found his niche, making nearly 50 appearances in the one season he spent there before he returned to Northern Ireland to play for Linfield.
After a three-year stint with Linfield, he was transferred to Carrick Rangers f.c. and then moved on to Coleraine for a further season before moving to his last Irish league club Larne.f.c. He then got reinstated as an amateur and began to play for Raglan Homers in the Ballymena Sunday Morning League which by the way was his first club.

Thomas Levett (priest)

Rev. Thomas Levett (died 1843) served as rector of Whittington, Staffordshire, for 40 years, and as a large landowner in addition to being a clergyman, played a role in the development of Staffordshire's educational system. He was also a member of one of Staffordshire's longest-serving families in ecclesiastical circles, having produced three rectors of the parish of Whittington. The Levett family also produced Members of Parliament, High Sheriffs of Staffordshire, Lichfield town recorders and businessmen who were friends and contemporaries of Samuel Johnson, Erasmus Darwin, writer Anna Seward, actor David Garrick and other local luminaries. Several streets in Lichfield are named for the family.
Rev. Richard Levett served as Whittington's vicar from 1743 to 1751. His son, also Rev. Richard Levett, served as vicar of Whittington from 1795 to 1796; and Rev. Thomas Levett served for forty years, from 1796 to 1836. There are memorials to the Levett family in St. Giles Church in the village, located about three miles (5 km) from Lichfield. Large landowners, the family also established charitable gifts towards the Whittington Free School, and were generous donors to schools and other foundations in the county.
Rev. Thomas Levett was the son of Thomas Levett of Packington Hall and nephew of John Levett, who sat for one term as a Tory Member of Parliament before he was recalled. Rev. Levett was the grandson of Theophilus Levett, Lichfield town clerk in the early eighteenth century.
Large landowners, the Levett family also made liberal endowments to the church at Whittington. Rev. Levett lived in Packington Hall, a Levett family property that had been acquired in the eighteenth century. The same Levett family also lived at Wychnor Hall at nearby Wychnor, Staffordshire. The family also owned the ancient woods at Hopwas, Staffordshire, a holding inherited by Rev. Thomas Levett.
Levett was early interested in education in the region in which his ancestors had lived for more than a century. He was among family members managing a family bequest to the local schools.
Thomas Levett was also a well-known sportsman, and frequently hunted with family friend British general and royal aide William Dyott, whose family lived at nearby Freeford Hall. The artist James Ward, a longtime family friend, painted the rector as he hunted at Packington in a canvas called "Portrait of the Rev. Thomas Levett and Favourite Dogs, Cock-Shooting, 1811".
Thomas Levett was married to Wilmot Maria Gresley, daughter of Sir Nigel Bowyer Gresley, 7th Baronet of Drakelowe Hall, High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1780, of the Gresley Baronets, a family seated at their Drakelow Derbyshire manor since the end of the eleventh century. Following his marriage, Rev. Levett quartered the arms of Levett with those of his wife's family. She died December 17, 1845. Memorials to Wilmot Maria Gresley and her husband Rev. Levett are in St. Giles Church in Whittington. The couple had no children.
Packington Hall, designed by architect James Wyatt, sat in of parkland owned by Thomas Levett. Situated just over three miles (5 km) from Lichfield, where the first Staffordshire Levett had served as town clerk in the early eighteenth century, Packington Hall home was the residence of successive generations of Levetts. The home was remarkable for its avenues of old oaks and elms.
Another distant branch of the Sussex Levett family lives at Milford Hall in the same county. The two branches of the family were reunited when in the late nineteenth century a Wychnor Levett married a Milford Hall Levett.

Architect of record

Architect of record is the architect or architecture firm whose name appears on a building permit issued for a specific project on which that architect or firm performed services. Building permits are issued by a government agency with the authority in a certain jurisdiction to regulate building construction and enforce building codes. Generally, the building contractor submits the application for the permit to the regulatory authority, along with a building project's drawings and specifications (called collectively "construction documents"). But in some jurisdictions, the architect is required to submit the construction documents needed to obtain the building permit. And with some construction projects, more than one building permit is issued. That occurs when several different architects perform services on discrete parts of a single building project. More than one architect of record, therefore, would exist in such a case.
When an architecture firm from one location is working on a project that is outside of their geographic location or range of expertise, the firm can also work with an architect that is either local to the project site or skilled in a particular area. In this case, the primary architect works with the local architect in order to complete the project, and the local architect becomes the "architect of record." This type of working relationship is common when brand-name architects win competitions but find themselves in need of architects with more practical skills or knowledge of local conditions. Or more pragmatically, the brand-name architect simply needs an architect who is local to the project site, facilitating quicker site visits and project oversight.
For so called local architecture firms that are responsible for corresponding with city agencies about code compliance, tender documents, client communication and creating up to 90 percent of the construction documents and carry out construction inspections should be referred as Executive Architect.

Fédération sportive du Travail d'Alsace et de Lorraine

"Fédération sportive du Travail d'Alsace et de Lorraine" (French for 'Labour Sports Federation of Alsace and Lorraine', abbreviated FSTAL) was a labour sports federation in Alsace-Lorraine during the interbellum period. FSTAL was organized separately from the French "Fédération sportive du Travail" (FST). During the spring of 1923, FSTAL had 11542 members whilst FST had a total membership of about 5000. FSTAL published "Le Sport Ouvrier" ('Workers Sport').
As of 1923 communists had gained the majority in FSTAL, and the organization became affiliated with the Red Sport International (Sportintern). Its organs began to violently denounce the reformist Socialist Workers' Sport International (also known as the 'Lucerne Sport International').
Sectors dissatisfied with the communist turn inside FSTAL gradually left the organization. In December 1926, socialists founded the "Fédération sportive et gymnastique du Travail d'Alsace et de Lorraine" (FSGTAL) in order to counter the influence of FSTAL. However, in 1929 FSTAL obtained (in spote of its public criticisms against the body) membership in the Lucerne Sport International.
As of 1931, FSTAL had a membership estimated at around 10 000, double the size of the socialist FSGTAL. Its membership was at the time comparable to the FST.
In February 1935, FSTAL and FSGTAL merged into FSGT.

Humber Hornet

The FV1620 Humber Hornet (FV1620, truck 1-ton, air portable, armoured launcher, Hornet launcher) was a specialised air-deployable armoured fighting vehicle designed to carry the Malkara, an anti-tank guided missile developed by Australia and the United Kingdom. 
History.
The Hornet was developed in the 1950s to provide British and Australian airborne units with an air-dropped long-range anti-tank capability. Based on the British Army's FV1611 Humber Pig one-tonne (0.98 tons) 4X4 armoured truck, it carried two Malkara, missiles on a retractable boom at the rear, as well as two reloads. It could be transported by air in a Blackburn Beverley and air-dropped on a cluster of 6 special parachutes.
Operation.
The gunner fired the missiles from inside the cab and controlled them by means of a joystick attached to a wire which unreeled from the missile sights. Electronic signals controlling the missile's flight were transmitted through the wire. 
With a 27kg warhead, the Malkara missiles carried the largest warhead ever fitted to an anti-tank weapon, and could destroy any tank in service at the time.
The vehicle remained in service with British units until being replaced in the 1970s by the Ferret armoured car Mk 5 equipped with Swingfire missiles. It was also operated by a squadron of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment.

Nikolaos Votsis

Nikolaos Votsis (, Hydra, 1877 - Athens, 1931) was a Greek naval officer who distinguished himself during the Balkan Wars and rose to the rank of Rear Admiral.
Life.
Votsis was born in the island of Hydra to the prominent Botsis-Kountouriotis family. He was the nephew of admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, while his maternal great-grandfather was Georgios Kountouriotis, participant of the Greek War of Independence. His studies at the Naval Academy were followed in 1904-1906 by two years' training service in the French Navy. At the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912, with the rank of Lieutenant, he was commanding torpedo boat No. 11, a vessel already old at the time (it belonged to a batch of 6 constructed in Stettin in 1884).
Sinking the "Feth-i Bülend".
Setting sail from his base at Litochoro, on the night of , Votsis led his vessel into the harbour of Thessaloniki, at the time still held by the Ottomans. Inside the harbour, which was protected by minefields and coastal batteries, lay a handful of Ottoman vessels: aside from four tugboats, the only warship was the old ironclad "Feth-i Bülend". It was not a combat-worthy vessel, as its weaponry had been dismantled to reinforce the coastal batteries.
According to Votsis' own description, he evaded the searchlights of Karaburnu fortress which stood at the entrance of the harbour, and sighted the "Feth-i Bülend" at 23:20. Sailing closer and directly towards the unsuspecting vessel, he launched his starboard torpedo at 23:35 from a distance of 150 m, followed by the portside torpedo. As he turned his ship around, he also launched the deck-mounted torpedo, but it exploded on the quay. While the torpedoes struck the "Feth-i Bülend", Votsis sailed out of the harbour at full speed, relying on his craft's shallow draught to pass over the minefield and sailed towards Greek-held territory.
The "Feth-i Bülend" sank rapidly. Casualties however amounted to only seven men from its crew, as most were ashore manning the guns. The sinking of the "Feth-i Bülend" may not have had much military significance, but it provided a great morale boost to the Greeks: it was the first of a series of naval successes in the war, and the Hydriot Votsis was propelled to the status of a national hero, readily associated with the legendary fireship captains of the Greek Revolution.
Later career.
Promoted to Lt Commander, he was placed in command of the captured Ottoman torpedo boat "Antalya", which was renamed to "Nicopolis". Votsis remained in the Navy, and in 1920, he was captain of the battleship "Kilkis". In January 1921, he was appointed as Greece's High Commissioner to the Allied mission at Constantinople, a post he held until February 1922, when he was appointed captain of the battleship "Lemnos", which he commanded until September 1922. Disagreeing with the revolt of the Army, led by Venizelist officers, against the royalist government, he resigned and went into retirement with the rank of Rear Admiral. From 1927 to his death in 1931 he was the president of the "Greco-Albanian Association" with Philippos Dragoumis, brother of Ion Dragoumis as secretary.

Discrimination against the homeless

Discrimination against the homeless is the act of treating the homeless, or those perceived to be homeless, unfavorably. As with most types of discrimination it can manifest in numerous forms.
Discriminatory legislation regarding homelessness.
Use of the law to discriminate against the homeless takes on disparate forms: restricting the public areas in which sitting or sleeping are allowed, ordinances restricting aggressive panhandling, actions intended to divert the homeless from particular areas, or enforcing laws on the homeless and not on those who are not homeless.
The French novelist Anatole France noted this phenomenon as long ago as 1894, famously observing that "the law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges".
Criminalization of homelessness in the United States.
There is a growing trend in the United States towards criminalizing the state of being homeless. Proponents of this approach believe that punitive measures will deter people from a homeless lifestyle.
To this end, cities across the country increasingly outlaw life-sustaining activities—such as sleeping, eating, sitting, and begging—in public spaces, and selectively enforce more neutral laws—such as those prohibiting open containers or loitering—against homeless populations.
Violators of such laws typically incur criminal penalties, which result in fines or incarceration or both.
Homeless people with new "criminal charges" have very restrictive housing and employment options, if either, for years.
In April 2006 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that "making it a crime to be homeless by charging them with a crime is in violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments."
Criminal victimization.
There have been many violent crimes committed against the homeless due to their being homeless. A study in 2007 found that this number is increasing.

Boris Porena

Boris Porena (Rome, 27 September 1927) is an Italian thinker, music composer and didactical expert. He is married to Paola Bučan, a famous Croatian cellist and teacher who is a tenured professor at the "Conservatorio di Musica" in Perugia (Italy).
He was a disciple of Goffredo Petrassi - alongside other distinguished musicians such as Ennio Morricone, Aldo Clementi, and Sergio Cafaro. Although he was initially influenced by neoclassical poetics, he later evolved towards the use of the harmonic language of the late Renaissance period, which he has used with originality in order to build his own musical research which directly influenced his later compositional processes.
He started composing when only 12 years old. His career is effectively in two distinct and different periods - the first being up until 1967 during which time he gained a wide national and international success. From 1968, as consequence of the evolution of both his thought and his social involvement, he abstained from composing, a period which lasted for the next twenty years. During that time he devoted himself to a grassroots cultural practice and set up the Metacultural Centre, located at Cantalupo in Sabina (Rieti, Italy). In 1988 he began to compose again with renewed enthusiasm, starting on a new and different compositional phase.
As a musical critic he has written essays about his master, Goffredo Petrassi along with several other important texts about music; among them "Musica-Società" (Einaudi, 1975) stands out, going beyond purely musical issues and authoritatively examines and explores the fields of social and political analysis.
He has taught new didactics of composition at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory in Rome and he has been director of the Research and Experimental Centre "Musica in Sabina". Among his many disciples are Jesús Villa-Rojo, Luca Lombardi, Celestino Dionisi, Giuliano d'Angiolini, Derek Healey, James Clifford Brown, Claudio Pietro, Jorge (Manuel Rosado Marques) Peixinho, Armando Santiago, Oliver Wehlmann, Massimo Fornetti, Alessandro De Rosa and many more.
His non compositional writings cover a number of other fields, especially pedagogy and grassroots didactics, but also philosophical reflections such as those expressed in "Metacultural Hypothesis: an hypothesis for survival" (1999).
He has a considerable and deep-seated interest in natural sciences which have led him to becoming something of an authority in entomology and especially in coleopterology.
He has written a rich collection of poetry, especially in German, his mother tongue.
The Hypothesis.
His deep interest in the global problems affecting contemporary society have led Boris Porena, together with the Metacultural Centre, to formulate the Metacultural Hypothesis (MCH), also known as "the Hypothesis".
This Hypothesis has known several formulations.
For example:
Every one of our acts or thoughts, being a possible communication object, has in itself a cultural component which must be relativised with regard to the culture which has produced it.
But also:
MCH coincides with the interruption of the principle of non contradiction.
And even in a third form:
Given any proposition "p", it is always possible either to find or to build a local cultural universe LCUp within which "p" becomes 'true'
Musical Works.
His rich musical production, which comprises hundreds of works, has been accurately catalogued by prof. Patrizia Conti (see "L'Utopia possibile"). The following works should particularly noteable:

2008–09 Libyan Premier League

The 2008–09 Libyan Premier League season was the forty-first edition of the competition since its establishment in 1963. Al Ittihad were the defending champions, having won their fourteenth Libyan Premier League title with just one round of matches to spare in the previous season. The campaign began on Friday October 17, 2008, delayed due to Libya's World Cup qualifiers, and, depending on the Libyan Cup, is scheduled to finish on June 26, 2009. A total of 16 teams contested the league, including 13 who competed the previous season and three promoted from the Libyan Second Division. (see Libyan Second Division 2007-08)
The first goal of the season was scored by newly promoted Wefaq Sabratha's Stefan de Paul against 2003-04 champions Al Olomby in the thirty-second minute of the game on the opening day of the season on October 17. Atef Hussein of Al Olomby scored the first hat-trick of the season against Al Sweahly on December 16, netting two in the final six minutes to help his side to a 3–3 draw.
The season paused for its usual mid-season break. However, this season's break was extended due to the national team's participation in the 2009 African Championship of Nations, and participation (at club level) in Africa's continental competitions. The season continued on March 13.
Wahda Tripoli were the first club to be relegated following a 4–1 defeat to Ahly Benghazi on May 28, 2009.Wefaq Sabratha's relegation was also confirmed on June 18, 2009 despite defeating Jazeera 4–1, as other results went against them. Jazeera's defeat also meant that they would not be remaining in the division for next season.Aman al Aam were relegated on the final day of the season. Although they defeated Khaleej Sirte 2–0, they needed Hilal Benghazi to lose to Sweahly to stay up on head-to-head record. Hilal secured a 0–0 draw, ensuring their survival by one point.
Ittihad Tripoli won the title on June 19, 2009 after defeating Sweahly 2–1 to gain an unassailable lead over second-placed Ahly Benghazi.This was Ittihad's 5th league title in succession, and their 15th overall.

Simon Brenner

Dr. Simon Brenner is a fictional character portrayed by David Lyons on the television show "ER".
Life at County General.
Brenner was introduced as a new ER attending physician, first seen in bed with two women before arriving for his first shift. His character is superficially very charming, especially with the ladies. While Brenner is a talented physician, he is unwilling to share his knowledge and teach the new medical students. Even when consistently reminded that Brenner works in a teaching hospital, he still refuses to teach procedures to those who need or want the practice. He sleeps with one med student and later insults both her romantic and professional skills. When Pratt informs Dr. Anspaugh of Brenner's attitude, it is revealed that Brenner is Anspaugh's nephew.
At the end of season 14, Simon and Neela get into a heated argument in which she told him he was only at County because of his family ties to Anspaugh, attacked his attitude and told him no one else wanted him around. This leads to them sleeping together. They do so again in Season 15 and continue to spar like an old married couple. Simon is later shown with a girlfriend who is doing a thesis on Middle Eastern politics at the University of Chicago. Towards the end of Season 15 Neela tells him they have no romantic future together, although the pair eventually end their relationship amicably.
In the episode "Age of Innocence", it is revealed that Brenner was molested as a child by his mother's boyfriend. Morris wants him to get help to deal with the trauma, but Brenner tells him he is dealing with "in my own way". Later in "Shifting Equilibrium", Brenner is shown to be visiting a therapist and coming to terms with having been abused.
The series finale, "And in the End...", also shows Brenner mentoring and giving support to new medical student Julia Wise (Alexis Bledel) after the death of a patient.

Wonder of the World (album)

Wonder of the World is the second studio album from contemporary Christian rock band Rush of Fools. It was released on September 16, 2008 through Midas Records and debuted at No. 187 on the "Billboard" 200. The album's first single was the title track "Wonder of the World".
Background.
Rush of Fools was in studio recording for the album earlier in the year, April and May 2008, completing the process mid-year. The album's title was announced by July 2008. It was produced by Scott Davis, Jason Ingram and Rusty Varenkamp, and mixed by Lee Bridges with Tom Laune.
The members of Rush of Fools considered the album to be different thematically than the lyrics of their self-titled debut "Rush of Fools". The band's guitarist and co-writer Kevin Huguley said in an interview that, "on our first album, we focused a lot on our sin—our need for grace—and the second album still has parts where we talk about our struggles, but this album focuses on the joy we have in Christ".
Music and lyrics.
Kevin Huguley self-described Rush of Fools as a "little worship band". The track "Never Far Away" is a love song dedicated to the band members' wives, and was written about the life of touring across the United States; "but they are never far away because of the love that God has given us for each other and our marriage relationships are in our hearts." A remix for "Never Far Away" was produced by Jim Brickman, and was made for Adult Contemporary stations, which became very popular.
Release and reception.
"Wonder of the World" was released on September 16, 2008 and received moderate commercial success following the band's debut release "Rush of Fools". It charted at No. 187 on the "Billboard" 200 in its first few weeks of release.
Critical reception of the album was somewhat mixed, however. Gospel Music Channel's review noted that, since Rush of Fools is a band based on the Christian worship genre, there is a "higher bar to vault over".
Track listing.
"Wonder of the World" contains 11 main tracks, one untitled bonus track, and another untitled track that contains 29 seconds of silence.

Delegation of Control

In computing Delegation of Control is assigning a person or group specific administrative permissions for an Organizational Unit. In information management, this is used to create teams that can perform specific (limited) tasks for changing information within a user directory or database. The goal of delegation is to create groups with minimum permissions that grant the ability to carry out authorized tasks. Granting extraneous/superfluous permissions would create abilities beyond the authorized scope of work. 
Active Directory.
In Microsoft Active Directory the administrative permissions this is accomplished using the Delegation of Control Wizard. Types of permissions include managing and viewing user accounts, managing groups, managing group policy links, generating Resultant Set of Policy, and managing and viewing InOrgPerson accounts.
A use of Delegation of Control could be to give managers complete control of users in their own department. With this arrangement managers can create new users, groups, and computer objects, but only in their own OU.

NetCorps

NetCorps (French: "Cyberjeunes") was a volunteer-organizing coalition consisting of nine Canadian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), funded by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and managed by the NetCorps coordination unit. Through the program, the organizations created international information and communication technologies (ICT) internships in developing countries around the world. Interns typically participated in six-month programs, leaving between August and November for host organizations in the placement countries. Positions were limited to 19–30-year-old Canadian citizens or landed immigrants who had "appropriate information and communication technologies skills". Typical duties included creating webpages, developing databases, computer networking, setting up hardware, preparing manuals and other documentation, and general-to-advanced computer instruction.
Program.
Budget.
During the 2007-2008 season, the program placed 240 interns and was funded by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) at a cost of C$4.6 million. The program covered all travel and accommodation expenses for the interns, provided a modest living allowance and a completion bonus.
History.
NetCorps creation.
NetCorps Canada International was conceived in 1996 by Dr. David Johnston (Governor General of Canada as of 2011 and former President of the University of Waterloo), a prominent lawyer and adviser to the federal government on information-highway issues.
Phase I.
In 1997 Industry Canada, in partnership with the Special Initiatives Division of Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC), funded a NetCorps-style test project that sent two residents of Cape Breton to Angola for Internet and Geographic Information Systems projects. This NetCorps conceptualization and placement was done through the Centre for Community and Enterprise Networking (C/CEN) and Dr.Michael Gurstein, Director of the Centre and (at the time) Chair in the Management of Technology Change at the University College of Cape Breton. An initial NetCorps training program and manual were produced as a result of this program. Notably, the two placements in Angola were of previously unemployed young adults from Cape Breton; they were provided with training in Linux through C/CEN as part of a demonstration program in the economic benefits that could be achieved through local investment in Information and Communications Technologies in economically marginal regions.
Phase II.
In 1998 the efforts of Industry Canada, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and a consortium of Canada’s largest international development volunteer-sending agencies secured 14 internships in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Phase III.
Further collaboration with Industry Canada and the consortium of international development agencies in 1998 saw the Canadian International Development Agency offer 30 internships in the Americas. This phase was announced by the Prime Minister at the 2nd Summit of the Americas in Santiago, Chile in April 1998.
Phase IV - NetCorps Canada International.
From 1999 to 2006, the NetCorps consortium sent more than 1700 NetCorps volunteers overseas, due to the collaboration of Industry Canada and the Youth Employment Strategy financed by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC).
2006–2007 – Transition Year.
In 2006–2007, the consortium successfully organized the placement of 236 volunteers in collaboration with Industry Canada and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). 2006-2007 was the last year that Industry Canada would be involved in the NetCorps program.
Phase VI – 2007–2008.
For 2007–2008, (CIDA) replaced Industry Canada as funders of the NetCorps program. The 240 placements offered that year were once again part of the Government of Canada’s youth-employment strategy.
The program was discontinued indefinitely as of the 2008–2009 season.

Rock River Music

Rock River Music, a division of Rock River Communications, Inc., is a music branding agency with offices in San Francisco, California and Putney, Vermont.
Founded in 1995 by Jeff Daniel and Billy Straus, Rock River Music produces music-based products, advertising campaigns and promotions for clients such as Pottery Barn, adidas, Gap, Ford Motor Company, Holiday Inn and others.
History.
Music producer and founder Billy Straus created one of the first for-sale branded CD compilations for Pottery Barn in 1995. The collection of holiday music entitled "A Cool Christmas" sold all 15,000 units within two weeks. Rock River has continued to produce branded CD compilations for Pottery Barn, with over 100 titles released in over a decade. At least three compilations have sold in excess of 100,000 copies.
In 2001, Rock River provided Volkswagen with "RadioVW", an early example of brand-sponsored internet radio. RadioVW offered listeners multiple channels of music, including tracks from Volkswagen television ads.
With the continued rise of digital music in recent years, Rock River has negotiated innovative licensing deals with record labels for client-branded online promotions. For example, in early 2007, Rock River began producing music-based video and audio podcasts for clients such as Chrysler and Ford. According to the Wall Street Journal, Rock River "struck some of the first deals to license major-label content for podcasts."
Rock River's services have also expanded to include original music production. For the 2007-8 Major League Soccer season, Adidas tapped Rock River to select well-known artists from every city with an MLS team to create song "anthems" for their hometown teams. Artists featured included Mike Jones (Houston), The Rapture (New York), OK Go (Chicago), Bad Brains (Washington, D.C.), E-40 (San Jose), Barenaked Ladies (Toronto) and The Polyphonic Spree (Dallas). After the Houston Dynamo won the MLS Cup, the team asked Mike Jones to perform his anthem "Houston Dynamo (Don't Play)" during their celebration at Houston's city hall.
In 2009, Banana Republic tapped Rock River to help coordinate their “City Stories” advertising campaign in North America and internationally for Banana Republic's overseas and franchise-owned stores. The campaign featured nine established and developing artists including Sara Bareilles, Chris Carrabba (Dashboard Confessional), Liz Phair, OK Go and others. 
The “City Stories” media campaign included print ads, banners and billboards with the featured artists, an online microsite with video interviews, live performances and free music downloads, as well as the first ever branded video channel on Virgin America's RED in-flight entertainment system.
Additionally, Banana Republic distributed download cards for 9 free songs as a gift-with-purchase. Rock River also worked with each of the artists to write and produce a set of original songs written about Banana Republic's overarching "City Stories" theme for download in the second phase of the campaign. Other Rock River produced tools for the campaign include video podcasts, a YouTube channel and in-store performances by several of the artists.

Stavanger IF Fotball

Stavanger IF Fotball, the football division of Stavanger Idrettsforening, is a football club from Stavanger, Norway. In Rogaland, they are simply known as "Sif", and few people would refer to them as "Stavanger".
SIF reached the semi finals of the Norwegian Football Cup in 1912, 1914, 1929 and 1930. Its latest stint in the First Division, the second tier of the Norwegian football league system, was in 2009. The club is currently playing in the Third Division.

One of the club's profiles from that period, Sverre Berg-Johannesen, was the first player from Rogaland to be capped for the Norwegian national football team.
After World War Two, Viking FK took over as the dominating football club in Stavanger. SIF went on to play in lower divisions, and the club was also passed by FK Vidar (another club from Stavanger) in terms of league position and achievements in the 1980s.
Per Ravn Omdal, president of the Norwegian Football Association from 1987 to 1992 and the current vice president of UEFA, started his active career with SIF.
With Roger Nilsen as manager, SIF was promoted to the Third Division in 2006 and advanced further to the Second Division in 2007. On 25 October 2008, SIF secured promotion to Adeccoligaen for the 2009 season after winning Second Division group 3, but were relegated back to the Second Division, group 3 for 2010. They were promptly relegated again, to the Third Division, after losing their group in 2010.
Stadium.
SIF currently play their home matches at SIF Stadion, which is located in Bekkefaret in Stavanger. Prior to the 2009 season in Adeccoligaen, the stadium was upgraded with a new seated spectator stand and improved facilities for players and match officials. 
Unlike other stadiums in Stavanger, like Viking Stadion and Stavanger Stadion, SIF Stadion has an artificial turf.
