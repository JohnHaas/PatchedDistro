Ecological Movement of Thessaloniki

Ecological Movement of Thessaloniki (, "Oikologiki Kinisi Thessalonikis"), is the oldest living eco-political group of Greece. It was founded in 1982, by an initial core of people with ecological sensitivities who wanted to turn them into action. Among them was Michalis Tremopoulos (currently an elected councillor in the Thessaloniki Prefecture and an elected member of the Executive Secretariat of Ecologist Greens, the Greek Green Party) and Yiannis Tziolas, who are still active. Oikologiki Kinisi in fact means ecological move or action or movement. This shows an emphasis on action and social mobilization. The political agenda of the group consists of the main pillars of the green ideology: ecology, peace/non-violence, grassroots democracy, human rights, social solidarity, with a strong social context. A major influence was Murray Bookchin's social ecology. André Gorz, Ivan Illich and Cornelius Castoriadis were also significant influences. 
The first major campaign was about Thessaloniki's Ring Road (or By-Pass), which was planned to pass through the urban forest that surrounds the city and means a lot to its citizens. Thousands of trees were planned to fell. Demonstrations both on the site of the works in the forest and in the city's main streets raised a significant public support (there was a march where 2000 people were gathered). Unfortunately, this mobilization didn't manage to cancel the construction of the new road. It gave the group however, a good boost to continue.
The group had an open form of organisation, with a weekly free meeting as an organisational core element. Decisions were made by all persons present. It served something like a school from which many initiatives emerged and took their autonomous route. In 1984, a small group of university students in Thessaloniki, most of which belonged to Oikologiki Kinissi, undertook the first attempts to treat injured or sick wild animals. They rescued animals from the city zoo, where the public abandoned them not having anything better to do with them other than stuff them. Very soon the small group joined the Hellenic Ornithological Society (http://www.ornithologiki.gr/en/enmain.htm), and wildlife rehabilitation became a regular activity of the Society for several years and received much publicity for its success. In 1990, the Hellenic Wildlife Hospital, a non-profit organization, was founded by the most active rehabbers, who were mostly members of the original team.
The group studies, prepares proposals and generally is active about issues of urban ecology, the traffic problem, the protection of the urban forest, the city sewage treatment, etc. In June 1998 it participated in the Global Street Party, organised by the British group Reclaim the Streets. Another direction of action is the nearby biotopes, like the forest of Chortiatis or the two Ramsar wetlands (Deltas of Axios, Loudias and Aliakmonas rivers and lakes Koronia and Volvi). 
In the 1990s.
At the end of the 1980s, the group took an initiative for the formation of a Greek Federation of ecological and environmental organisations, which had successful results. However, the Federation soon transformed in 1990 to a political party (Alternative Ecologists), which proved to be short-lived, since many problems came on the surface. The collapse of the party brought a decline in membership for the larger groups, while the smaller and newer groups ceased to exist. Oikologiki Kinisi Thessalonikis managed to survive but with very reduced membership. However, the group's positions had still a strong appeal. In 1995, members of the group founded ANTIGONE – Information & Documentation Centre on Racism, Ecology, Peace and Non Violence (http://www.antigone.gr/). In the mid '90s a green-left list was agreed in order to participate to the local elections. This list had strong anti-nationalistic opinions, during a period that nationalistic sentiments were stirred by the name and flag of the new neighbour of Greece (Republic of Macedonia) and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the local elections of 1998, the list managed to have the support of the Greek party of the European left (Synaspismos) and made it possible to elect one member to the Prefecture Council (M. Tremopoulos).
The group, motivated by its anti-war and non-violent positions, declared its opposition to the war in former Yugoslavia, the ethnic cleansic practices of the Serbian Government and NATO interference. It tried to draw the attention of the Greek public against the support of Mr. Milosevich. It tried to strengthen the ties of the Balkan green, peace and democratic groups and it organised a conference with speakers from the Serbian Independent Syndicates and the Kossovar independent press. 
During the 1990s, a sub-group working on issues of conscientious objectors, peace, anti-militarism and non-violence, initiated the magazine ARNOUMAI (I REFUSE).
After 2000.
In 2000, the main campaigns were about genetically modified foods (effort to build a nation-wide coalition against GMOs) and the changes to the Greek Constitution proposed by a parliamentary committee. Particularly, the proposed change of Article 24, concerning forest and nature protection, was unacceptably vague and less strong than the previous form. A strong protesting current emerged, by local ecological groups, national environmental NGOs, and other organisations. In 2004, a Greek Network against GMOs managed to form (http://www.gmostop.org). 
Oikologiki Kinisi also initiated the Ecological Forum (in 2000), aiming in bringing together the more politically oriented green groups of Greece, active individuals and Prasini Politiki, the then member of the European Greens. This finally resulted in another effort of party building, which took the form of Ecologist Greens. The party was founded in 2002 and became a member of the European Federation of Green Parties [http://www.eurogreens.org/). 
In the local elections of 2002, M. Tremopoulos was re-elected in the Council of Thessaloniki Prefecture, as well as in 2006. In the European elections of 2004, he headed the list of candidates of Ecologist Greens for the European Parliament:
http://www.eurogreens.org/cms/candidates/dok/7/7443.tremopoulos@en.htm
In the European elections of 2009, he headed once again the list of candidates of Ecologist Greens. The party received 3.45% and Michalis Tremopoulos got elected. He is the first Green MEP from Greece [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/public/geoSearch/view.do;jsessionid=9CE7479D0723306346A5799D597DCD4B.node1?language=EN&partNumber=1&country=GR&id=96909].

HMS Amphion (1846)

HMS "Amphion" was a 36-gun wooden hulled screw frigate of the Royal Navy. She was initially ordered as a sail powered ship, but later reordered as a prototype screw frigate conversion.
Design and construction.
"Amphion" was initially planned and ordered from Woolwich Dockyard as HMS "Ambuscade" on 13 May 1828, but was renamed on 31 March 1831. She was laid down on 15 April 1840, but on 18 June 1844 she was reordered as a screw propelled frigate, to a design by White. She was duly launched on 14 January 1846, and commissioned on 13 May 1847. Her engines and machinery were provided by Miller, Ravenhill & Co, to a design by John Ericsson. "Amphion" had cost £36,115 for her hull, with a further £16,673 spent on buying and fitting the machinery, which was installed at the East India Docks. A further £22,794 was spent on fitting her for sea, which was carried out at Sheerness. She was reduced to 30 guns in 1848, but had been restored to 36 guns in 1856. The space taken up by the machinery was found to considerably restrict the amount available to store provisions and munitions.
She was sold to Williams on 12 October 1863 to be broken up.

Radio (Beyoncé song)

"Radio" is a song by American recording artist Beyoncé Knowles taken from her third studio album, "I Am… Sasha Fierce" (2008). The uptempo synthpop and dance-pop song was composed by Knowles, Rico Love, Dwayne Nesmith and Jim Jonsin. Composed in the key of D major and built essentially on bouncy beat, "Radio" also displays influences of the 1980s synthpop, Europop, and house. It is instrumentally complete with a Roland TR-808 drum, bass instruments, and synthesizers. The song's lyrics describe the love of Knowles in her childhood for the songs she used to listen on the radio as she grew into an adult.
"Radio" received positive reviews from contemporary music critics, who generally praised Knowles's departure from her usual R&B style. Some of them also complimented the believability as well as the originality of the song and chose it as the standout track of "I Am.. Sasha Fierce". In September 2009, "Radio" was used to promote Dutch radio station Radio 538, and it subsequently charted for six weeks on the Dutch Top 40 chart, where it peaked at number 14. It also reached number five on its urban chart. "Radio" was part of Knowles' set list on her I Am... Tour (2009–10) and was included on the live album "I Am... World Tour" (2010).
Production and composition.
"Radio" was written by James Scheffer, Rico Love, Dwayne Nesmith, and Knowles. Production was handled by Jim Jonsin, who also produced of "Sweet Dreams" (2009). "Radio" is different from the usual R&B material for which Knowles is known; It is a electropop and dance-pop song that exhibits influences of 1980s synthpop, Europop, and house. Following the release of "I Am... Sasha Fierce", Knowles explained the concept behind the song on her official website:
It just seems like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't do all the things that a lot of the other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into something positive.
According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, "Radio" is an uptempo song set in common time, written in the key of D major. It follows the chord progression of Bm–G–D–A/C and Knowles' vocals span from the note of A3 to E5. Built on a bouncy beat, "Radio" is instrumentally complete with a Roland TR-808 drum, bass instruments, and synthesizers. Several music critics, including Ben Westhoff of "OC Weekly", noted that "Radio" bears resemblance to Rihanna's single "Umbrella" (2007) as they are both set to 1980s-style synthesizers." Similarly, James Reed of "The Boston Globe" wrote that "Radio" seems to be like the latest electro-pop confection from Rihanna. Darryl Sterdan of the Canadian website Jam! wrote that "Radio" sounds like a record Madonna would sing because of its electropop and dance-pop musical styles.
The believability of the song's lyrics, which conveys love testaments as well as its timeless endurance, sung on sensual vocal arrangements by Knowles, who additionally adopts a sneering attitude, demonstrates her alter ego Sasha Fierce. Lyrically, "Radio" explores the relationship between Knowles as the female protagonist and the songs played on the radio, shown in the lyrics: "You're the only one that Papa allowed in my room with the door closed / We'd be alone / And Mama never freaked out when she heard it go boom / 'Cause she knew we were in the zone". Amy Linden of "Vibe" magazine felt that "Radio" could make an ideal "valentine" song because of its lyrical content.
Critical reception.
"Radio" received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics, who praised Knowles's brief departure from usual R&B style as well as the believability and originality of the song. Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" noted that though the 1980s synthpop mode of "Radio" may not be as well suited to Knowles' voice as the old soul samples contained in "Crazy in Love" (2003) and "Suga Mama" (2007)", there is no denying that "Radio" is an "irresistible pop song". Colin McGuire of PopMatters highlighted Knowles's diversion from her usual R&B style, writing that "Radio" is "a bit of a novelty act " which takes Knowles down a road much different than we have ever seen. He further wrote that the different elements of dance music present in the song makes it feel refreshing, before adding that "it might even suggest a more expansive, experimental side of the songstress on her follow-up". Talia Kraines of BBC Music wrote that "wild" "Radio" makes it the standout track on "I Am... Sasha Fierce". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine chose "Radio" as the highlight of both the standard and deluxe editions of "I Am... Sasha Fierce", writing that it is the most convincing love song on the album.
James Reed of "The Boston Globe" described "Radio" as fun, bouncy, and ideal for a night at the club. Similarly, Leah Greenblatt of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that the "spiky, Europop throb" of "Radio" expertly taunt the boys and fill the dance floor. Darryl Sterdan of Jam! was surprised by the new musical direction of Knowles but concluded that "... you better believe it ... it kinda works". Daniel Brockman of "The Phoenix" described "Radio" as the most believable song on the album, and complimented its "amid bland testaments to love's timeless endurance and the smut and thugginof the 'Sasha Fierce' persona, [which is one with sensual overtones sung to an electronic device that, unlike men, 'never lets me down'". Echoing Brockman's sentiments, Amy Linden of "Vibe" magazine, who wrote that 1980's electro pop and the sleek Valentine music of "Radio" tells the story of Knowles' alter ego. Similarly, Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond of "The Village Voice" wrote that "Radio" "show[that Sasha just a good girl playing fierce". By contrast, Matos Michaelangelo of "The A.V. Club" said that "Radio" sounds like "shameless target-marketing" aiming at programming directors. On "The Village Voice" 2008 year-end Pazz & Jop singles list, "Radio" was ranked at number 443.
Promotion and chart performance.
Knowles performed "Radio" on her I Am... Tour (2009–10). The song was subsequently included on the live album "I Am... World Tour", as the thirteenth track. In early September 2009, "Radio" was used to promote Dutch radio station 'Radio 538'. On September 19, 2009, "Radio" debuted on the Dutch Top 40 at number 31 after it was used to promote the local radio station. After three weeks, it peaked of number 14 on October 10, 2009, and charted for six weeks. "Radio" also peaked at number five on the Dutch urban chart.

The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show

The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show is an Irish breakfast radio show broadcast on weekday mornings from 07:00 - 09:00 on Today FM. Presented by Ian Dempsey, it is noted for its "Gift Grub" feature, performed by Mario Rosenstock. It is the tenth most popular radio programme in Ireland and was named best breakfast programme at the 2007 PPI Radio Awards.
Dempsey won a Meteor Award for Best Radio DJ at the 2003 Meteor Awards and has been nominated on a regular basis ever since, most recently in 2008. The show has also had a number of renowned producers including Adelle McDonnell and Alison Curtis, who resigned from the post after being given her own weekday radio show on the station in 2008.
In 2008, "The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show"'s listenership figures were reduced by 4,000 to 234,000.
History.
"The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show" has been on air since September 1998 and originally broadcast until 10:00 but an extra hour was given to "The Ray D'Arcy Show" in 2004 to allow direct competition with RTÉ 2fm rival Gerry Ryan. Each year for that time period, i.e. ten years, Dempsey and the breakfast crew have gone skiing. In 2007, the show replaced Eamon Dunphy's RTÉ Radio 1 Sunday morning programme as the 10th most listened to programme in Ireland. Lucy Kennedy presented the show when Dempsey was absent on 18 July 2008.
In 2011, Sinéad O'Connor announced her fourth marriage live on the show.
Features.
"Talking Heads" features a number of voices played in quick sequence. Listeners are allowed to guess the voices to win a cash prize. "Free For All Friday" occurs each Friday when the listeners may request which songs are played on the show.

Efi Oshaya (, born 2 June 1956) is an Israeli politician and a former member of the Knesset for the Labor Party.
Biography.
Oshaya was born in Israel and completed his military service with the IDF's Air Force with the rank of First Sergeant. He later completed a degree in business management at Lexington University in England.
His political activity included his election as chairman of the Histadrut in Netanya and as a membe of Netanya's local council. In 1996, he was first elected to the Knesset and served as the Labor's group whip. In the elections to the fifteenth Knesset, in 1999, Oshaya was left out until 2001, when Uzi Baram retired from politics. He remained in the Knesset until the expiration of its term, in 2003, and during this time served as group chairperson for One Israel (a list comprising the Labor Party, Gesher and Meimad). In 2006 he re-entered the Knesset, replacing Haim Ramon, but resigned less than 24 hours later due to conflict of interest with his professional work in lobbying.
Oshaya is currently heading "Policy" firm for lobby and business networking. He is also chairman of the Labor Party's election committee.

Ferrovia Alifana

The Ferrovia Alifana is a former railroad company of southern Italy. It held public passenger service on the rail line connection Naples to Piedimonte d'Alife (now Piedimonte Matese). In 2005 it was acquired by the MetroCampania NordEst (MCNE), another public company responsible of passenger transport in northern Campania.
The company was inaugurated on March 30, 1913, with a first service held on the line Naples P.zza Carlo III Station-Santa Maria Capua Vetere/S.Andrea dei Lagni-Biforcazione-Capua (43 km), with 11,000 V 25 Hz monophase AC electric traction. Service from Caiazzo to Piedimonte began in 1914, held with steam locomotives. A line from Naples/Secondigliano to Santa Maria Capua Vetere was opened later. Gauge was 935 mm for both lines.
The railway suffered heavy damage during World War II. While the first line was restored in 1963, using standard gauge and diesel traction, the railroad from Secondigliano did not receive the same attention, and, despite its high traffic, was closed in 1976 and replaced by bus service. This move was to be temporary, but only in 2005 a renewed section of the line, connecting Piscinola to Mugnano, was reopened. 
In the same year the whole service on the Alifana railroad was acquired by the new public company MetroCampania NordEst. The company is currently responsible of the service from Santa Maria Capua Vetere station, which had connection with the Trenitalia line to Naples, to Piedimonte Matese, and from Piscinola to Mugnano (to be extended to Teverola).

Autostrada A12 (Italy)

The A12 is an Italian autostrada (motorway), composed of two unconnected parts.
The first one connects Genoa and Rosignano Marittimo, the second connects Civitavecchia and Rome.
Overview.
Plans to build the remaining stretch have existed for long time, but have never been executed, mostly because of the bad impact on the environment. While a "superstrada" (an almost motorway-like road, with 2 separate carriageways and interchanges) with a speed limit of 110 km/h exists between Rosignano Marittimo and Grosseto, the present road between Grosseto and Civitavecchia has 90 km/h speed limit, with long parts of single carriageway and even some parts of 2-lane road.
The 2 proposed solutions are an entirely new motorway (with higher impact on the environment), and the upgrade to motorway standard of the present road (more environmentally friendly). Lack of agreement between supporters of either idea has led to the present situation.
The road is also known as "Autostrada Azzurra", the Blue Motorway.

Autostrada A15 (Italy)

The A15 is an Italian autostrada (motorway) connecting Parma and La Spezia through the valleys of the Taro and Lunigiana Rivers. The road is also known as Autocamionale della Cisa because it crosses the Northern Apennines at the Cisa pass. The main 101-km expanse of the motorway connects the A1 with the A12 (Genoa-Rosignano Marittimo), thus directly linking the Po Valley with the Italian Riviera and the Versilia region.
The toll road is operated by the company Autocamionale della Cisa S.p.A. The franchisee's current toll charges are: car or motorcycle, €10.40; Overheight vehicle (>1.3m), €10.70; 3 Axles, €14.40; 4 Axles, €22.70; 5 or more Axles, €26.30.
At the 9-km mark, drivers are welcomed by a curious monument, a tuft of steel and cement sculpted by Luigi Magnani and placed in the traffic island between the two carriageways. The monument is visible to motorists coming from the A1.
History.
The first phase of this motorway, dating to the 1950s, was designed to provide an alternative route between the Po Valley and the coastal Tyrrhenian Sea. The construction required several viaducts and tunnels to attain the maximum altitude of 745 metres above sea level at the entrance of the tunnel crossing. Built as a dual carriageway (divided highway), it is very curvilinear and challenging to drive and, therefore, has long been used for testing new heavy duty vehicles.
Except for short stretches of the highway, the road surface is not porous or fitted with storm drains, making it difficult to negotiate during heavy rain.
Route.
The motorway begins from the A1, near Parma. From the Parma Ovest (West Parma) exit the highway climbs through the Taro Valley with exits to Fornovo di Taro, Borgotaro and the village of Berceto, all within the Emilia-Romagna region. After traversing the tunnel, the highway continues into Tuscany, with exits to Pontremoli and Aulla. Shortly after entering Liguria it intersects the A12 at Santo Stefano di Magra, a few kilometres from La Spezia.
There are five service stations and rest areas along the way.
Provincial Abbreviations: PR = Parma; MS = Massa-Carrera; SP = La Spezia
Proposed construction.
A plan to extend the motorway route to the north through Fontevivo, Martignana di Po and Nogarole Rocca, linking to the A22 (the "Autobrennero") around Verona, has been proposed. Land has been secured both for straightening the present route through the construction of new viaducts and tunnels and for the proposed extension. The town of Villafranca in Lunigiana and neighbouring municipalities have petitioned for opening such a new toll motorway. Negotiations have begun with private motorway companies and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport.

Whitefin trevally

The whitefin trevally, "Carangoides equula" (also known as the horse trevally) is a species of deep water offshore fish in the jack family Carangidae. The species inhabits the tropical to temperate waters of the Indo-pacific and Central Pacific, ranging from South Africa in the west to Hawaii in the east. The whitefin trevally is a moderate sized fish, growing to 37 cm, and is distinguished by a number of morphological traits including fin size, gill raker count and colour. It inhabits the continental shelf and slope at depths of up to 200 m over sand and mud substrates where it preys on fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. Studies in Japan indicate a length at sexual maturity of 17.4 cm on average, with spawning occurring between May and October, with each individual spawning multiple times. Whitefin trevally is of high importance to fisheries in Japan where they are taken by trawlers, although the catch numbers have halved since the 1980s. It is of minor importance elsewhere throughout its range, and is considered a good table fish.
Taxonomy and naming.
The whitefin trevally is classified within the genus "Carangoides", a group of fish commonly known as jacks and trevallies. Carangoides falls into the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, itself part the order Perciformes, in the suborder Percoidei.
The species was first scientifically described by Dutch naturalists Coenraad Jacob Temminck and Hermann Schlegel in 1844 based on a specimen taken from the waters off Japan, which was designated to be the holotype. They named the species "Caranx equula", although the species was later moved to "Carangoides", as well as having a new genus created for it; "Kaiwarinus". This genus is currently considered invalid, even though a 1988 review of the phylogeny of the Carangidae found it to be valid, and to be the sister genus to "Pseudocaranx", not closely related to "Carangoides". The species was independently renamed as "Carangoides acutus" in 1974, but this is rejected as a junior synonym under ICZN nomenclature rules.
Specimens taken from Hawaii and Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean initially had the name "Caranx (Carangoides) dasson" applied to them by the American ichthyologist David Starr Jordan and Snyder. This name was eventually synonymised with "Carangoides equula", but uncertainty still remains whether this population actually represents a separate species or subspecies. The "Carangoides dasson" population has the same diagnostic features as "Carangoides equula", but exhibit more slender bodies and larger eyes, with William Vaniz-Smith indicating more research is required to determine the relationship between these populations. The name "Caranx (Carangoides) dasson" is still currently considered to be invalid by taxonomic authorities.
Description.
The whitefin trevally is a relatively small fish, reaching a maximum known length of 37.5 cm. The species has a body shape similar to a number of other jacks, having a compressed almost rhomboidal body, with the dorsal and ventral profiles approximately equally convex. The dorsal profiles of the snout and nape in the species are almost straight. There are two separate dorsal fins, the first having 7 spines, while the second consists of 1 spine and 23 to 25 soft rays. The first dorsal fin is moderately high, with the longest spine approximately has high as the soft dorsal-fin lobe is long, and is quite distinctive of the species. The anal fin consists of 2 anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 21 to 24 soft rays, with the pelvic fin having one spine and 18 or 19 soft rays. The lateral line has a moderately strong anterior arch with the junction of the curved and straight sections occurring vertically below the twelfth to fifteenth soft rays of the second dorsal fin. The curved segment of the lateral line is longer than the straight section, which contains 0 to 6 scales followed by 22 to 32 scutes. The breast is entirely scaled, or has a very small naked area anteroventrally. Both jaws contain narrow bands of small teeth, with the outer teeth slightly larger. There are 27 to 32 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae.
The whitefin trevally is silver, with a blue to green dorsal surface, becoming silvery white below. The soft dorsal and anal fins are dusky yellow basally, with the anterior rays of both having dark grey-brown median and white distal bands. The caudal fin is dusky yellow, while the pectoral and pelvic fins are white. Juveniles have between 5 and 7 dark bands vertically on their sides.
Distribution and habitat.
The whitefin trevally is thought to primarily inhabit deep waters on the continental shelf and slope between 90 and 200 m deep over sandy and muddy substrates. There has been at least one record of the species in shallow inshore waters, where an individual was captured off a sandy beach on Japan, but thought to be stray fish.
Biology.
The whitefin trevally is a benthic predator, taking a variety of small fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, either by foraging or chasing down its prey using its eyes which are extremely well adapted to the deep, low light waters. Along with the white trevally, "Pseudocaranx dentex", it is the only member of the Carangidae to have the anatomy of its eyes examined, with the study finding excellent dark environment sight due to the presence of a tapetum.
The maturation and reproduction of the whitefin trevally have been extensively studied off Japan due to the species economic importance in this region. Sexual maturity is reached at a minimum length of 15.1 cm, although most individuals reach maturity at around 17.4 cm length and every individual is mature by 24 cm. Although these parameters were calculated for female fish, observational data suggests the male life history is similar. In Japan, the species has a prolonged spawning season running from May to October, during which females spawn repeatedly, releasing between 13,862 and 79,899 eggs per batch. The growth of males and females is very similar, and both have a similar lifespan. A length of 7.5 cm is reached after the first year, and lengths of 12.3 cm, 16.0 cm and 18.8 cm after the second, third and fourth years respectively.
Relationship to humans.
The whitefin trevally is a commercially important species in the waters off Japan, where it is known as , and of minor importance elsewhere throughout its range. For unknown reasons, the Japanese catch has decreased by half since the mid-1980s. It is taken primarily by bottom trawls on the continental shelf and considered to be a good table fish.

A16 motorway (Switzerland)

The A16, a motorway in north-central Switzerland, is a divided freeway connecting the border to France to the A5 motorway, to the south on the Swiss plateau.
The A16 motorway is a long, winding corridor that crosses the Jura Mountains from the Canton of Jura through part of the Bernese Jura area, to the flat part of the canton of Berne on the Swiss plateau. Therefore it is called "Transjurane". It is congruent with the National Highway N16 and following its anticipated completion around 2020-2030, it will connect the French motorway network with the rest of the Swiss national road network. The extension provides for both four-lane standard (highway) and two-lane sections of "express roads" ("Autostrasse"). At present (2008), there are approximately 48.5 km (57%) of roadway in operation, other sections are under construction or are in planning.
Status of construction.
The following sections are in operation:
The following sections are under construction:
The following sections are currently still in the planning phase:
Because of the current financial constraints, the Swiss Federal Government can postpone most of the works on new sections. The connection of the A16 to the A36 motorway in France (Mulhouse - Dijon) between Montbéliard and Belfort is to be completed within a time horizon of 2025-2030.
Costs.
Along its course, the A16 has many engineering structures, mainly tunnels but also some bridges. Therefore, the A16 is one of the most expensive road projects in Switzerland. For the whole line, a total cost of 5.6 billion Swiss francs is estimated.
Tunnels.
Because of the difficult terrain in the area of the Jura Mountains, the construction of numerous tunnels is necessary to pass underneath the various Jura chains. The main tunnels (from north to south) with a length of more than are:
There are 16 more tunnels that are less than in length and were partly created in open pits. Some tunnels are, or have been, built to protect the residents of nearby villages and hamlets from the noise emissions.
History.
The A16 was not one from the start to the national motorway network in Switzerland, although there were initial projects of Jura rapid-traverse between Biel and Belfort, as early as 1964. The inclusion of the A16 in the plan of the national road network came in 1984, after the population had approved construction in the Canton of Jura, with a large majority (71%). The highway should be the favored new project of the Jura and the Ajoie. The efficient transport corridor is to ensure, after completion, a much faster connection to the rest of Switzerland.
Even after entering the national motorway network, there was the part of environmentalists strong opposition to the project. In the context of the so-called Clover Initiative, the construction of the A16 should be submitted to the entire Swiss population to vote. Due to the high acceptance of the project in the affected regions, the request was withdrawn before a vote on other controversial motorway cuts (in April 1990).
Paleontology.
During the construction work on the A16, in the vicinity of Courtedoux, workers found a slab with about 500 footprints of dinosaurs, which used to live in the area about 150 million years ago.

Hope and Social

Hope and Social are a six-piece (plus) rock band based in Leeds, England. Formed in 2008 they have released 3 albums in under three years and have toured extensively. Hope and Social are characterised by their "Pay What You Want" approach to their music.
In July 2008, Hope and Social released their first EP with a full-length album to follow. On October 7, 2008, the band appeared on Channel M, a TV station based in Manchester.
On June 3, 2009, the band released their new album, "Architect of this Church". The album was in the making for 2 years and took over 16000 man hours to record. It was made available to purchase on their website, for however much the purchaser thinks it is worth.
In 2009 the band performed twice at Glastonbury as finalists in Glastonbury's Emerging Talent Competition.
In April 2010, Hope and Social released "April", their second full length album and the first to feature fully the new line-up of the band.
In May 2011, Hope and Social's third studio album "Sleep Sound" was released and immediately rose to No.1 on bandcamp.com.
In March 2012 the band released an album "Cotton Wool & Knotted Wood", recorded live, and their fourth studio album "All Our Dancing Days" was released on 13 November 2012.
Members.
"Four Day Hombre".
March 13, 2006 saw the nationwide release of their debut album, "Experiments in Living", as Four Day Hombre and through their own record label, Alamo Music.
The publicity activities accompanying the release of this album, along with the unusual history of Alamo Music, raised the profile of the band considerably during 2006. On February 7, 2006 they played a half-hour session on the Janice Long show on BBC Radio 2, which featured a number of live acoustic performances as well as a discussion with the band. The album release was followed by a tour of Barfly venues around Britain.
In the autumn of 2006 they toured the UK supporting Embrace and released the mini-album "Fight Death". A tour of Canada was completed in March 2007, to support the release of "Experiments in Living" in that country. The tour included support slots for Canadian bands The Marble Index and The Miniatures.
On May 15, 2008, it was announced by the band that they were changing their name to Hope and Social, stating "same line-up, but with a different approach and sound".
Self-recorded demo, 2000. Available on CD only; no catalogue number.

Self-recorded demo, 2000. Available on CD only; no catalogue number.
Alamo Music.
Alamo Music is the first ever fan funded, fan owned record label, created in 2004 as a conduit for Four Day Hombre's music.
A number of fans of the band invested the capital necessary to formalise the label, and to finance the recording and marketing of the Four Day Hombre debut album "Experiments in Living". They hence became shareholders in Alamo. This 'fan-funded' approach has produced significant publicity for the band in national and regional press. For example, an article concerning the label and its formation was featured on the front page of the BBC website on March 13, 2006, the day of release of "Experiments in Living".
The name Alamo was chosen in reference to the Battle of the Alamo. A quote from William Barret Travis, commander of the Texan forces at this battle, is printed on the inside of "Experiments in Living": "I shall have to fight the enemy on his own terms."

Sir Winston Churchill (schooner)

Sir Winston Churchill was a sail training ship which was built in Hessle, Yorkshire by Richard Dunston Ltd. She was sold out of service in 2000 and currently serves as a private yacht.
History.
"Sir Winston Churchill" was designed by Camper & Nicholson and built in 1966 to compete in the Tall Ships Race. The patron of the project was Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Public donations partly funded construction of the ship, and the Sail Training Association raised about half the needed money. The vessel was named for Winston Churchill, wartime leader and twice Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; Churchill had died the year before his namesake's construction. Her rig was deliberately designed to incorporate all the main types of sail. In November 1965, "Sir Winston Churchill" toppled over onto her starboard side whilst she was being fitted out. All three masts were broken. The accident happened a week before she was due to be launched by HRH Princess Alexandra.
In January 1967, she sank at Southampton, Hampshire. On 26 July 1967, she ran aground at Holyhead Harbour, Anglesey but was refloated after four hours. In 1968 a sister ship, "Malcolm Miller" was launched. "Sir Winston Churchill" differed from "Malcolm Miller" in having round topped cabin doors as opposed to square topped doors. "Sir Winston Churchill" entered the 1979 Tall Ships Race with an all-female crew. In 1976, the vessel took part in a transatlantic race to celebrate the Bicentenary of the United States Declaration of Independence. On 27 July 1981, she ran aground off Great Yarmouth, Norfolk with 60 female trainees on board. In 2000, "Sir Winston Churchill" was replaced in service by "Prince William" and sold by her owners, the Tall Ships Youth Trust. Her last voyage for the Tall Ships Youth Trust ended on 2 December 2000 at Portsmouth. 
"Sir Winston Churchill" was sold to a company based in the Isle of Man. Initially she was used as a sail training ship, with a reduced capacity of 20 trainees instead of the 36 (3 watches of 12, Fore, Main & Mizzen) that the Tall Ships Youth Trust carried. She was totally refitted and re-engined in 2002 with twin Iveco diesel engines replacing her Ford Mermaid engines. She was originally fitted with 2 off 654 Perkins engines for propulsion and 2 off 499 for power generation.

Emily Mary Osborn

Emily Mary Osborn (1828–1925), or Osborne, was an English painter of the Victorian era. She was best known for her pictures of children and her genre paintings, especially on themes of women in distress.
Early life.
Emily Osborn was born in Essex, the eldest of nine children of the Rev. Edward Osborn and his wife Mary,who took up the curacy of West Tilbury under its rector Edward Linzee during the spring of 1834, when Emily was about 5. The family occupied the parsonage at the top of Gun Hill, which is pictured in a lithograph of 1845 by D. Walton. Osborn lived for some 8 years at the parsonage, though she afterwards recalled that her "early surroundings ... were not such as to develope artistic proclivities, there being but little natural beauty in the country around West Tilbury ...". There, her mother encouraged her "and watched with pride the clever portraits Emily drew of her brothers and sisters". The parent herself possessed a great love of painting and had, on her own account, "wished in vain to study Art professionally". The same article speaks of experimentation at this period, how the teenage girl, not always being able to obtain the paints she desired "devised a plan of making an extra supply of colours from flowers, by putting the petals into bottles with a little spirits of wine".
Move to London and exhibition at RA.
Her father's final entry in the parish registers of St. James', was on 2 November 1842, after which the family removed to London – "to the great delight of his eldest girl, who rightly considered there was now some chance of realising the hopes she entertained of one day becoming an artist". Thereafter she attended evening classes at the Dickenson academy, Maddox Street. She then studied privately under one of the masters from Maddox St., and later at his gallery in Newman Street for a year. In 1851, at the age of seventeen, Osborn began showing her work in the annual Royal Academy exhibits, and continued to do so over a span of four decades (to 1893). Her first paintings to be sent to the Royal Academy were a few portraits and figure subjects "of unpretending character", in the Great Exhibition year, 1851. In 1854 the R.A. exhibited a small picture by Osborn, titled "Pickles and Preserves", which was purchased by C. J. Mitchell, Esq., who later introduced the artist to his brother, Mr. William Mitchell. He, "hearing she was desirous of producing something of greater importance", gave Emily a commission for a group of life-sized portraits of a lady (Mrs. Sturgiss) and her three children. With the 200 guineas received for this work, she 'added a studio to her residence'. She had also, in that same R.A. exhibition (1855) hung a smaller painting called "My Cottage Door", "which brought the artist well-deserved fame" and was purchased by Queen Victoria.
Major works.
Her most famous single work is "Nameless and Friendless" (1857), which has been called "The most ingenious of all Victorian widow pictures." It depicts a recently bereaved woman attempting to make a living as an artist by offering a picture to a dealer, while two "swells" at the left ogle her. Osborn's "The Governess" was shown at the Royal Academy in 1860, and purchased by Queen Victoria. Works of this type, which focused on the distresses of women in contemporary Victorian society, have earned Osborn the designation "proto-feminist artist."
In 1861 Osborn exhibited her "The escape of Lord Nithsdale from the Tower, 1717" at the Royal Academy. This historical painting shows Nithisdale eluding custody by dressing as a woman. Osborn's interest in women and women artists is encapsulated in her 1884 picture "Portrait of Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon", in which feminist artist Barbara Bodichon was portrayed at her easel. Osborn executed a second portrait of Bodichon in 1888.
Later life and work.
A magazine article of the mid-1880s outlined the artist's later story. In 1868, she lost her mother "and for two years did no work of importance", then for six months she and her sister devoted themselves to nursing the sick and wounded in the Franco-Prussian War. "Then came her visits to Venice and Algeria, made familiar (to gallery-goers) by her pictures in the Grosvenor and elsewhere". At home, she also toured and painted among the Norfolk Broads.
In 1914 Ellen Sickert (daughter of Richard Cobden and first wife of Walter Sickert), writing under the pseudonym "Miles Amber," published her novel "Sylvia Saxton: Episodes of a Life". Sickert dedicated her novel to Osborn and her companion Mary Elizabeth Dunn.
She never married and died, aged 97, in 1925.

The club is on Golf links Road near the popular view point 'Suicide Point' ("Green Valley View") and before the 'Pillar Rocks' viewpoint and flower garden.
This club is notable for its age and the wildlife frequently seen on the course. The club logo is two crossed golf clubs behind an indian tiger on a round yellow field, framed with ""Kodaikanal Golf Club * Play the Game"" imprinted in white on a dark green border.
History.
The club was established on June 17, 1895 by twelve British golfers. They were also the architects of the course. In the early years, members were British and American civil servants and missionaries. During the fifties it became a club tradition for the annual Captaincy to rotate between an Indian, an American and a Commonwealth citizen. This tradition continued until the late 70's, when the local expatriate population diminished. Originally there were only 9 holes and the putting surfaces were browns. In the early fifties the course was extended to 18 holes. In 1986 the putting surfaces were relaid with greens.
The clubhouse, named the Centenary Building, was built in 1995.

The 6th hole is named "Tiger Hole" because Tigers used to be sighted near it. The 12th hole is called the "Cardiac Hole", due to the strenuousness of the walk. A "hard hitters" course, the 13th "Twister" green is not visible from the tee box. The 15th hole ("New Long'un") which has the longest yardage of , needs two long shots to sight the green.

Pierre Lefaucheux

Pierre-André Lefaucheux (30 June 1898 – 11 February 1955) was a leading French industrialist and recipient of the Order of Liberation, awarded to heroes of France's Liberation during World War II.
As the first Chairman of Renault during the critical years after World War II, Lefaucheux died in 1955 at age 56, while directing the development of the forthcoming Renault Dauphine. 
Lefaucheux was the subject of the 2009 biography, "Patron de Renault, Pierre Lefaucheux (1944-1955)" by Cyrille Sardais.
Early years.
Born at Triel-sur-Seine, and descended from the French inventor Casimir Lefaucheux, Lefaucheux was second of the four children of Pierre André Lefaucheux and Madeleine Dulac.
He volunteered for military service in September 1917, his record of military achievement in the First World War being crowned with his receipt of the croix de guerre.
Returning to civilian life he enrolled at the école centrale des arts et manufactures, obtaining his diploma in 1922.
Lefacheux began his working life with a brief spell at the North France Railway Company, before joining in 1925 the Compagnie générale de construction de fours (General Boiler Manufacturing Company) where he would build his career until 1939, and where he became a director.
In parallel, he began in 1929 a doctoral thesis which he would submit in 1935 on the subject of “The peseta and the Spanish economy”.
Resistance.
War would again transform Lefaucheux's life. Called up in 1939, he was appointed Director for the Le Mans ammunition factory in January 1940.
His distinguished Resistance career was truncated when he was captured and imprisoned at Buchenwald
Renault.
After the nationalisation of the Renault automobile business Lefaucheux took charge of the company in 1945. Lefaucheux had no great passion for cars, and even after being appointed to the top job at Renault he continued, for some time, to travel to work using his preferred form of locomotion, a pedal cycle. Lefaucheux set a pattern whereby Renault, despite now being a nationalised industry, ferociously rejected management by politicians: in this he was naturally able to draw on the network of influential former resistance leaders and fighters, many now in positions of power within the Fourth Republic French state. This was important at a time when France was ruled by a strongly dirigiste government, capable of implementing the Pons Plan which reflected government determination to structure the French auto-industry according to priorities identified by politicians and civil servants. Lefaucheux's stewardship saw Renault becoming France's leading automobile manufacturer, with Lefaucheux directing the development of the commercially successful Renault 4CV — and up until the time of his death, its successor, the Renault Dauphine.
Death.
On Friday, 11 February 1955, Lefaucheux was scheduled to give a presentation to Catholic students in Strasbourg. Despite inclement icy weather, Lefaucheux, an avid motorist, decided at the last minute to travel by car — placing his suitcase not in the trunk, but on the rear seat of his Renault Frégate. Approaching Saint-Dizier from the West, on the Route Nationale 4 (N4), he encountered a detour, which at the last moment he tried to follow. The road surface was covered with black ice, the car spun, rolled over and landed on its side in a field. Though the Frégate's passenger cell was largely intact, Lafaucheux's unsecured suitcase on the rear seat had struck him in the neck, killing him instantly. In his pocket, he carried a train ticket for the trip.
By the time of his death, Lefaucheux had overseen almost the entire development of the Renault Dauphine, which would be presented at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1956. He was succeeded at Renault by the company's vice-president, Pierre Dreyfus.
A monument in Lefaucheux's memory was erected at the N4 near Saint-Dizier.
The Renault Flins factory was renamed in his honor, as well as a boulevard in Le Mans. He is buried at Saint-Quentin-des-Prés, in the Oise Department.
Marie-Hélène Lefaucheux.
Lefaucheux had been arrested by the Gestapo during World War II and was rescued by Marie-Hélène Postel-Vinay whom he subsequently married and by whom he was ultimately survived.
Together, Pierre and Marie-Hélène Lefaucheux became prominent members of the Resistance. Mrs. Lefaucheux later became a Member of the first Constituent Assembly (Aisne) of France, Counsel for the Republic elected by the National Assembly from 1946 to 1947, member of the French delegation to the United Nations. She was one of the fifteen founding members of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.
Her role in the Liberation of France was paraphrased in the 1966 Film Is Paris Burning. Marie-Hélène Lefaucheux died in the 1964 New Orleans crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 304.

Jambo Bwana

"Jambo Bwana" (in Swahili "Hello Mister") is one of the best internationally known Kenyan pop songs. It was first released in 1982 by Kenyan band Them Mushrooms, and later covered by a number of other groups and artists, including Mombasa Roots, Safari Sound Band, Khadja Nin, Adam Solomon and the German group Boney M.. Some versions come under different titles, such as "Jambo Jambo" and "Hakuna Matata".
"Jambo Bwana" has been largely adopted as a hotel pop song, targeting a tourist audience. Its lyrics (especially in some versions) can be regarded as a compendium of swahili language for tourist, as it includes several common phrases and greetings, such as "habari gani? nzuri sana" ("how are things going? very well") and "hakuna matata" ("no problem"). The original version by Them Mushrooms also included lines celebrating swahili language, reggae music, Africa, and "mushroom soup" (a reference to psilocybin mushrooms).
Popularity.
"Jambo Bwana" by Them Mushrooms was a huge commercial success, selling over 200.000 copies between 1982 and 1987 and getting platinum certification in Kenya. As a consequence of this popularity, many other bands covered the songs, in some cases with a similar success; the version by Safari Sound Band, in particular, is one of the most played songs in tourist venues in East Africa. The use of the swahili phrase "hakuna matata" in Disney's classic "The Lion King" might be a reference to the chorus of the song.
Them Mushrooms released the song in several of their albums, and both their version and cover version of the songs are found in many compilation of African pop music, including those dedicated to parties and children (such as the "African Playground" CD published by Putumayo Kids).
Covers.
Some of the covers of "Jambo Bwana" come under different titles and have modified lyrics. The Boney M. version, released in 1983, is entitled "Jambo - Hakuna Matata" and lyrics are in English and almost completely different; only the famous "jambo bwana" and "hakuna matata" lines have been preserved. The Safari Sound Band version "Jambo Jambo" has the central part of the lyrics changed, with references to reggae and mushrooms being replaced by other tourist-oriented common Swahili phrases such as "Kenya ni nchi nzuri" ("Kenya is a beautiful country").
Boney M. version.
In 1983, German group Boney M. released "Jambo - Hakuna Matata". Liz Mitchell provided the song's lead vocals, backed by Reggie Tsiboe, Frank Farian, Cathy Bartney, Madeleine Davis, and Judy Cheeks. The single was intended to be included in the group's untitled seventh album, to be released in the fall of 1983. Due to a poor chart performance (#48 in the German charts), the single ultimately was not included in the album (which was completely reworked and not released until May 1984 as "Ten Thousand Lightyears").
Several mixes of "Jambo" were made. The 4:06 mix (as featured in the accompanying music video) was only released in Spain and Portugal. A 3:39 edit was released elsewhere. The full 7:44 version was only released on the Spanish and Portuguese 12" singles - the German 12" single (despite crediting the timing 7:42 on the label) was actually an edit of 5:35. In France, an even shorter edit 5:15 was released.

Jastrząb is a village in Szydłowiec County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Jastrząb. It lies approximately east of Szydłowiec and south of Warsaw. It lies approximately 8 kilometres (5 mi) east of Szyd∏owiec and 108 km (67 mi) south of Warsaw. Jastrzab belongs to Lesser Poland, and used to be a town from 1427 to 1869.
The name of the village comes from Bishop of Krakow Wojciech Jastrzebiec, and since its foundation until 1795 (see Partitions of Poland), it belonged to Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship. According to Jan Dlugosz, Jastrząb was founded by Bishop Jastrzebiec in the year 1422. The village was located on a merchant route from Ilza to Skrzynno, and was granted Magdeburg rights on September 30, 1427, by Cardinal Zbigniew Olesnicki. Jastrząb has a parish church of John the Baptist. First church was erected here in the early 15th century. Burned in 1667, it was remodelled several times, and took its current shape in the early 20th century. There also was a castle, built in 1426 by Bishop Jastrzebiec. The castle was destroyed in the Swedish invasion of Poland, and has never been rebuilt.
Until 1789, Jastrząb remained private property of Bishops of Krakow, as part of their Ilza Estate (Klucz ilzecki). The town was a center of early industry, with iron ore and limestone deposits. In 1795, it was seized by the Habsburg Empire, and since 1815 it belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1820, the population of Jastrząb was app. 550, with 128 Jews. The town had 80 wooden and 21 brick houses. After January Uprising, Jastrząb was reduced to the status of a village (1869). In 1885, it received rail connection, on a line from Radom to Dabrowa Gornicza. In the Second Polish Republic, and in 1945 - 1975, Jastrząb belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. Since 1973, Jastrząb has been the seat of a gmina. The village has a sports club KS Jastrząb.

The Children's Bach

"The Children's Bach" (1984) is a novella by Australian writer Helen Garner. It was her third published book, and her second novel. It was well received critically.
Plot summary.
The novel, set in Melbourne, concerns a couple, Athena and Dexter, who lead a self-sufficient life with their two sons, one of whom is severely disabled. Their apparently "comfortable rut is disrupted by the arrival of Elizabeth, a tough nut from Dexter's past." Elizabeth brings with her her sister Vicki, Elizabeth's sometime lover Philip, and Philip's prepubescent daughter, Poppy. Through them, Athena and Dexter are drawn into a world whose ideas and values test the foundations of their relationship.
Writing process.
Helen Garner has said that "I never have a theoretical idea for a book. What I write usually emerges from things I've witnessed, experiences I've had myself, or that people around me have had … I don't invent a book out of thin air. I need —or I did at the time I wrote "The Children's Bach"— a bed of detail for the things to be based on before I can start to make something up". Garner continues to say that "I didn't know what was going to happen. I just knew that I wanted this family and that there would be a little boy who had something wrong with him, so you could only reach him through music. I hardly had any more idea than that."
Themes.
Kerryn Goldsworthy writes that almost all of Garner's fiction addresses "the relationship between sexual behaviour and social organisation; the anarchic nature of desire and the orderly face of the institution of 'family'". In "The Children's Bach" this is played out through its exploration of what happens when an apparently stable and caring marriage is challenged by the introduction of external forces —through Elizabeth, Philip and Vicki— which result in a "clash of values". The novel gives "a sense that characters are redefining their perspectives instead of being depicted at a stage when they are already locked into a fixed way of seeing, and surviving in, the world".
Style and symbolism.
Given the title, it is not surprising that music is the most obvious motif in the novella. It has been discussed by most of its critics and reviewers, as well as by Garner herself. Tiffin writes that music has always been important to Garner but that in the earlier works "it offered, like sex or drugs, a way of immersion or escape". However, in "The Children's Bach" "it is associated with most of the characters … and it generally suggests sanity and harmony. While Philip uses music to exploit people, it is a mark of Athena's unglamorous dedication to making life work, and of Dexter's uncomplicated gusto."
Music.
The book contains many references to music, both popular and classical. The title itself refers to "The Children's Bach", a collection edited by Australian music educator E. Harold Davies. The collection consists of 20 simple Bach pieces for piano, selected mostly from the Clavier-Book for Anna Magdalena.
Critical reception.
While "Monkey Grip" met with a mixed reception, "The Children's Bach" was better received and reviewed. Indeed, Goldsworthy writes that it was "met with almost universal critical approval".
In 1986, Australian academic and critic, Don Anderson, wrote that "There are four perfect short novels in the English language. They are, in chronological order, Ford Madox Ford's "The Good Soldier", Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby", Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises" and Garner's "The Children's Bach"." In 1985, Melbourne critic Peter Craven wrote in "Meanjin" that "The Children's Bach" is "light years from any sparkling tell-it-all naturalism. It is concentrated realism of extraordinary formal polish and the amount of tonal variation which it gets from its seemingly simple plot is multifoliate to the point of being awesome".
After its first publication in 1984, it was published by Penguin Books in 1996 and again in 2008.
Adaptations.
In 2008 a chamber opera, based on the book and also titled "The Children's Bach", was premiered at the Merlyn Theatre in Melbourne. It was composed by the Australian composer Andrew Schultz to a libretto by Glenn Perry.

Blue trevally

The blue trevally, "Carangoides ferdau" (also known as the banded trevally, barred trevally, Ferdau’s trevally and Forskaal’s jackfish) is a common widespread species of pelagic marine fish classified in the jack family, Carangidae. The blue trevally is distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific and central Pacific regions, ranging from South Africa in the west to Hawaii in the east. It is a moderately large fish, growing to a recorded maximum length of 70 cm, with the number of rays in the second dorsal fin and the colouring serving as diagnostic features of the species. The species inhabits waters to depths of 60 m, generally inhabiting reefs, beaches, lagoons and sandy substrates. The blue trevally is a predatory fish, taking other fish, prawns, crabs and molluscs, although very little is known of the species reproductive biology. The blue trevally is of varying importance to fisheries throughout its range, with some regions having high catches of the fish. It is considered to be a gamefish, and is sought after for its excellent eating qualities.
Taxonomy and naming.
The blue trevally is classified within the genus "Carangoides", a group of fish commonly known as jacks and trevallies. Carangoides falls into the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, itself part the order Perciformes, in the suborder Percoidei.
The species was first described by the Swedish naturalist Peter Forsskål in 1775 based on a specimen taken from the Red Sea. He named the species "Scomber ferdau", thus relating it to the mackerels before the family Carangidae was bought into existence with the creation of Lacépède's genus "Caranx". With the advent of carangid taxonomy, the species was transferred first to "Caranx" and finally to "Carangoides" where it has remained to this day. Gilbert Percy Whitley attempted to separate the species into its own genus; "Ferdauia", although this classification is not accepted. The species was independently described and named a number of times after its initial naming, with this and confusion with "Carangoides orthogrammus" in the Indo-Pacific giving rise to a complex history of synonymies. These later names were often transferred between genera before being finally sunk into the name "Carangoides ferdau" and as such are considered to be invalid junior synonyms. The specific epithet of "ferdau" refers to a person of the name 'Ferdau', probably the name of the collector of the holotype specimen.
Description.
The body is a blue green to yellow green colour above, becoming silvery below, with adults having 5 or 6 dusky vertical bands which usually persist after death. There are numerous, inconspicuous golden spots often present on the sides, mostly above the level of the pectoral fins. The soft dorsal and anal fins are pale yellowish green, and the anterior lobes of both often have white to blue tips. The caudal fin is yellow green, having a dark trailing edge and tips, while the pelvic fins are whitish to hyaline.
Distribution and habitat.
The blue trevally prefers coastal waters to a depth of 60 m, where it inhabits reefs, beaches, lagoons and deeper sandy substrates. The fish is reported to prefer waters adjacent to sandy beaches. The species lives pelagically, allowing movement between islands and atolls. The species is rarely found in estuaries, suggesting a poor tolerance to low salinities.
Biology and fishery.
Like many Indo-Pacific carangids, the biology and ecology of the blue trevally is poorly known, with the only data on the species relating to its diet. The blue trevally is a fast swimming predator which often forms small schools, and takes a variety of small fish (specifically mackerel and filefish), crustaceans including prawns, crabs and sea lice, soft molluscs and other soft prey. In Hawaii, they have been observed following foraging bonefish or goatfish, consuming any scraps uncovered by the foragers. The species appear to be in constant abundance all year, but ripe individuals have rarely been reported. No information regarding the reproduction and growth of the species is available, although it is known that larvae of the species appear during February in the waters off Taiwan, suggesting a December spawning period, and make up a high proportion of the larval abundance. Juveniles are known to sometimes shelter among the tentacles of large pelagic jellyfish.
The species is of commercial importance in a number of areas due to its high abundance, or more often taken as bycatch in other major fisheries. Catch statistics for the individual species are rarely kept though, and it is generally grouped with other trevallies. It is caught mainly on hook and line, as well as with gill nets and various traps. In South Africa, it is considered a popular gamefish, and is often taken by anglers using various small baits, with the best catches had at dawn and dusk. It is considered to be an excellent table fish, although there have been rare reports of ciguatera poisoning attributed to this fish.

A6 road (Latvia)

The A6 is a national road in Latvia, connecting Riga to the Belarusian border at Pāternieki. It bypasses Daugavpils in its north and passes through Krāslava and is also known as the Daugavpils Highway in Latvia.
The road is part of European route E22, European route E262 and the Latvian TEN-T road network. Once inside Belarus, the road becomes the Belarusian P20. The length of the A6 in Latvian territory is . Currently the A6 has two lanes in each direction between Riga and Ogre and between Nīcgale and Daugavpils, with other parts having just a single carriageway. The current speed limit in winter is , but in summer the dual carriageway parts are raised to .
Since 2013 a shorter route has replaced the Salaspils-Koknese section of A6 (numbered as P80), mainly built for transit traffic. The construction of it was first started in the 1980s, but the plan was abandoned later. The first stage of the construction starts in Tīnuži and ends in Koknese. It was planned to be complete by 2012, but due to economical reasons the works were delayed and were finished in 2013. Between 2020 and 2027 the authorities plan to bring the new road into Riga. It would also have 2x2 lanes with an expressway/motorway status. There are also plans to continue the new road parallel to the A6 as far as Pļaviņas. The annual average daily traffic of the A6 in 2013 was 8,036 vehicles.

The Messerschmitt M 18 (later also known as the BFW M 18) was an airliner produced in Germany in the late 1920s.
Design and development.
Designed at the request of Theodor Croneiss to supply his new airline venture which was to become "Nordbayerische Verkehrsflug" (NOBA), it was a conventional high-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed tailskid undercarriage. The prototype was built of wood, although production examples would have a metal structure. The design was praised in its day for the cleanness of its aerodynamics, lightness of construction, and economy of operation
Operational history.
The first M 18 to enter service with NOBA was provided by Messerschmitt in exchange for a 49% share of the new company, and on 26 July it began commercial flights. NOBA's early successes enabled the company to place orders for additional examples of an improved model, the M 18b. It would eventually purchase twelve of these, but manufacturing them would exceed the capacity of Messerschmitt's own small firm, leading to a merger with Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW) in 1927. Following NOBA's reorganisation into DEVAG in 1931, a small number of a further improved version designated M 18d were ordered, but the type was soon superseded by the similar but larger Messerschmitt M 20.

Loligo forbesii

Loligo forbesii (sometimes erroneously spelled "forbesi"), known commonly as the veined squid and long-finned squid, is a commercially important species of squid in the family Loliginidae, the pencil squids.
Description.
This squid grows up to 90 centimeters in mantle length. The long fins are roughly diamond-shaped and make up two thirds of the total length of the body. The color of the squid is variable, but is usually a shade of pink, red, or brown. The vestigial shell is a small, thin internal structure.
Distribution.
"Loligo forbesii" can be found in the seas around Europe, its range extending through the Red Sea toward the East African coast. It is widespread in the Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the most common cephalopods in the Celtic Sea.
Biology.
The squid lives at depths of . It attains sexual maturity at about one year old and lives 1 to 2 years, with a maximum life span of about 3 years. It generally only breeds once. The male delivers sperm into the mantle of the female using structures on a specialized tentacle. The female will spawn up to 100,000 eggs, which adhere to the substrate. Peak spawning season is in January through March off of Scotland, with recruitment of juveniles occurring in the fall. Off Galicia the breeding season lasts from December to May, with most mating occurring in December through February.
The diet includes fish, polychaetes, crustaceans, and other cephalopods, often members of its own species.
Fisheries.
This is one of the most common squid species fished in the United Kingdom.

The Priests

The Priests are a classical musical group made up of three Roman Catholic priests all from Northern Ireland. Fr. Eugene and his brother Fr. Martin O'Hagan are originally from the village of Claudy, County Londonderry with the family now residing in Derry whilst Fr. David Delargy is from Ballymena, County Antrim.
Early career.
The trio have been singing together since they boarded in the 1970s as students at St MacNissi's College, Garron Tower, County Antrim.. After signing a deal with SonyBMG in April 2008 the priests, all from the Diocese of Down & Connor, recorded their debut album in Northern Ireland and Rome, with the unusual honour of having been allowed to record in St. Peter's Basilica, The Vatican.
Career.
2008: "The Priests".
Their debut album was produced by Mike Hedges and Sally Herbert. Mike Hedges has worked with, amongst others, U2, Dido and Manic Street Preachers. The eponymous album was released in Ireland on 14 November 2008 by Epic Records 
and has since been released worldwide in over thirty countries and preceded by an ITV documentary and PBS special in the United States. 
In December 2008 they scooped the Guinness World Record for ‘Fastest-selling UK debut for a classical act’. The debut album turned 7 times Platinum in Ireland, and Platinum in UK, Sweden, Norway as well as going Gold in New Zealand, Canada and Spain. The group's concert schedule does not follow the usual band format as clauses in their bespoke contract places the emphasis on them continuing their pastoral work in their respective Parishes and in the Diocese of Down & Connor. In the 21 March issue of The Tablet, it is claimed that the album has sold more than 1 million copies in Ireland alone.
2009 – 2010 "Harmony" and "Noel".
In August 2009, they began recording their second album, entitled "Harmony", under the same production team. It was released in November 2009 and has reaped platinum awards in Ireland and Sweden, where the album reached the No 1 spot in the Swedish charts just before Christmas 2009.

Malmö Central Station

Malmö Central Station () is a railway station on the Southern Main Line in Malmö, Sweden opened in 1876. It serves approximately 17 million passengers per year, making it the third busiest in Sweden behind Stockholm Central Station and Gothenburg Central Station. With the opening of City Tunnel in 2010, the station began through services connecting south to Copenhagen via the Oresund Line, to stations north on the Southern Main Line, saving at least 15 minutes for through passengers.
History.
Malmö Station was first opened in 1856, coinciding with the opening of the Malmö–Lund railway. At the time, the area was considered the outer edge of the city, but was convenient to Copenhagen-bound ferries, which loaded and unloaded in the Inre hamnen right in front of the station building.
The building was next to destroyed ten years later, 14 December 1866, in a fire. When the building was reconstructed, the bell tower was kept. That part, between the platforms and the square Centralplan, was reopened in 1872.
More and more lines were built and consequently more and more tracks and train sheds were needed. The new train shed with four new tracks opened in 1891. The Malmö-Kontinentens Järnväg from Malmö to Trelleborg was built in 1898. In 1926, Malmö Central Station became the station's official name.
Though the train shed was built as a terminus, there is also a single through-line for freight next to the station building, allowing hopper wagons to access the port, where they serve a large granary plant producing most of the flour for baking in the counties of Skåne and Halland.
In 2000, both local and long-distance trains began running directly to Denmark via the new Öresund Bridge. Malmö became the centre of the new Oresundtrain regional railway system spanning eastern Denmark and much of southern Sweden, which in 2009 became integrated with local buses and trains in most of its service areas. The trains were, however, forced to reverse direction in Malmö’s terminal station, creating delays for anyone travelling to Denmark from Lund and beyond, and restricting the frequency of service, as each train had to both enter and leave Malmö by the same tracks, taking up space in between.
This situation was solved with the opening of the City Tunnel in December 2011, finally allowing through traffic. All passenger traffic to/from Denmark now uses the tunnel, and most local trains use it too, terminating instead at Hyllie station at the other end of the tunnel if not going beyond Malmö.
The tunnel tracks make up tracks 1-4, and most traffic has shifted to this new lower level of Malmö Central Station. The main overall roof sees relatively little traffic. It was renovated at the same time to accommodate occasional long-distance trains including some services to Stockholm and the night express to Berlin. Its tracks are numbered 5-10 (six tracks as opposed to the original seven: one track was torn up during renovation to allow for more commercial space adjacent to the Centralplan bus terminal). The adjacent train shed previously used for local Pågatågen was demolished in its entirety to allow for an extension to the Centralplan, its traffic taken over by the City Tunnel.
Awards.
In 2011 Malmö Central Station won the Brunel Award for its architecture.

Ice-sheet models use numerical methods to simulate the evolution, dynamics and thermodynamics of ice sheets, such as the Greenland ice sheet, the Antarctic ice sheet or the large ice sheets on the northern hemisphere during the last glacial period. They are used for a variety of purposes, from studies of the glaciation of Earth over glacial–interglacial cycles in the past to projections of ice-sheet decay under future global warming conditions.

Hundings

The Hundings (Old English "Hundingas", the "hound-clan") are a legendary tribe or clan in early Germanic sources, mostly mentioned due to their feud with the Wulfings (the "wolf-clan"). In the Poetic Edda, Hunding is a king of the Saxons, slain by Helgi Hundingsbane. The "Gesta Danorum" mentions a Danish king Helgo who slew Hundingus, king of Saxony, in single combat. The historical core of the story is likely a conflict between the Eastern Geats (the wolf-clan) and the Lombards (the hound-clan).
"Hunding" itself is a patronymic translating to "son of a hound", while the Hundings as a clan ("sibb") would be the descendants of Hunding. Being named a "hound" or "dog" was by no means an insult in pre-Christian Germanic culture, but that the animal was rather a symbol of the warrior, while in Christian Germanic culture, it became associated with heathendom, "heathen hounds" being an appellation especially of the pagan Vikings (c.f. Ulfhednar).
The name of Lamicho, king of the Lombards, may mean "little barker" (Harris 2004). 
In Paulus' "Historia Langobardorum", the Lombards terrorize their neighbors by spreading the word that they had dog-headed warriors, possibly a reference to ulfhednar. In Paulus's account, Lamicho is one of seven sons of a "prostitute" ("meretrix"), who is fostered by king Agelmund. This "prostitute" been explained by Much (followed by Höfler and others) as going back to a word for bitch. The Lombards' original ethnic name, "Winnili", has als been connected with "savage dogs" by Much.
In Eddaic account of a feud between the Hundings and the Wulfings surrounding Helgi Hundingsbane may correspond to the Lombard story, and Malone (1926) explains the whole story of Lamicho as the Hunding version of the same feud. Jacob Grimm (1848) compared the story of Lamicho to the German legends of the origins of the Welfen, in German legend tracing their ancestry to fostered babes who were given the surname of "whelps" (Harris 2004). Hundings also appear in Sturlaugs saga starfsama, where they are a tribe of Cynocephali dwelling in Hundingjaland, which is apparently in much the same latitudes as Permia. These Hundings may relate to those Cynocephali mentioned by Adam of Bremen. 
The "Hundingas" in Old English literature are mentioned in Beowulf, and in Widsith. The Widsith poem mentions the Hundings twice, once in a list of Germanic clans, as ruled by "Mearchalf", and a second time among outlandish tribes and peoples, in the sequence "mid hæðnum ond mid hæleþum ond mid hundingum" "with heathens, heroes and dog-people", implying a re-interpretation of the name as a remote people of "heathen hounds". This re-interpretation is complete in a later Anglo-Saxon manuscript on the "Marvels of the East", where the Cynocephali are glossed as "healf hundingas".

A Walk to Remember (novel)

A Walk to Remember is a novel by American writer Nicholas Sparks, released in October 1999. The novel, set in 1958-'59 in Beaufort, North Carolina, is a story of two teenagers who fall in love with each other despite the disparity of their personalities. "A Walk to Remember" is adapted in the film of the same name.
Writing.
Sparks wrote the manuscripts for "A Walk to Remember", his third novel, in the summer of 1999. He wrote it in North Carolina, which is the setting of the novel. Like his first published novel "The Notebook", the prologue to "A Walk to Remember" was written last. The title "A Walk to Remember" was taken from one of the tail end pages of the novel: "In every way, a walk to remember." The novel is written in first-person, and its narrator is a seventeen year-old boy, living in the 1950s.
The novel was inspired by Sparks' sister, Danielle Sparks Lewis, who later died of cancer in June 2000. Although the story is largely fictional, certain parts were based on real experiences. For example, his sister, just like Jamie, was never popular at school and always wore an ugly sweater. And just like Jamie, she always carried the Bible around with her every where she went. And just like Landon and Jamie, never in a thousand years did anyone think he would ever deeply fall head-over-heels for her. His sister's husband proposed marriage to her despite her sickness. After her death, Sparks said in the eulogy: "... I suppose I wrote this novel not only so that you could get to know my sister, but so that you would know what a wonderful thing it was that her husband once did for her."
Plot summary.
The story starts with a prologue from Landon Carter at age 57. The remainder of the story takes place when Landon is a 17-year-old high school senior. Landon lives in the small, religious town of Beaufort, North Carolina. His father is a genial, charismatic congressman.
His father is not around very much, as he lives in Washington, D.C. Landon is more reclusive, which causes some tension in their relationship. Landon's father pressures him into running for class president. His best friend, Eric Hunter, who is the most popular boy in school, helps him and, to his surprise, Landon wins the election. As student body president, Landon is required to attend the school dance with a date. He asks many girls, but none are available. That night, he looks through his yearbook, trying to find an acceptable date. Since nobody else seems to be available, Landon reluctantly asks Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of Hegbert Sullivan, the Beaufort church minister, who accepts his invitation. While Jamie is very religious and carries a Bible with her wherever she goes, Landon (one of the popular students) is reluctant to go to the dance with someone like her. When Landon is threatened by Lew, Jamie comes to Landon's aid, to his appreciation. At the end of the night, he admits she was the best date possible.
A few days later, Jamie asks Landon to participate in the school's production of "The Christmas Angel". While Landon is not very enthusiastic about participating, he agrees to it anyway. Jamie, on the other hand, could not be happier about her new cast mate. Landon knows that if his friends learn about his role in the play, he will be teased relentlessly. One day at rehearsal, Jamie asks if Landon will walk her home, after which it becomes routine. A couple of days later, Eric mocks the couple during their walk home and Landon becomes truly embarrassed to be with Jamie. Meanwhile, Landon continues to learn about all the people and organizations Jamie spends her time helping, including an orphanage. Landon and Jamie visit the orphanage one day to discuss a possible showing of "The Christmas Angel", but their proposal is quickly rejected by Mr. Jenkins. When Jamie and Landon were waiting to meet Mr. Jenkins, she tells Landon that all she wants in the future is to get married in a church full of people and to have her father walk her down the aisle. While Landon thinks this is a strange wish, he accepts it. In truth, he is beginning to enjoy his time with her.
One day, while they are walking home, Landon yells at Jamie and he tells her that he is not friends with her. The next day at the first show of "The Christmas Angel", Jamie enters the stage dressed as the angel, making Landon simply utter his line, "You're beautiful," meaning it for the first time. Following that, Jamie asks Landon if he would go around town and retrieve the jars containing money collected for the orphans' Christmas presents. When Landon collects the jars, there is only $55.73, but when he gives the money to Jamie, there is $247. Jamie buys gifts for the orphanage, and Landon and Jamie spend Christmas Eve there. Jamie's Christmas gift to Landon is her deceased mother's Bible. As they get in the car to go home, Landon realizes his true feelings for her. "All I could do is wonder how I'd ever fallen in love with a girl like Jamie Sullivan." He invites her to his house for Christmas dinner. The next day Landon visits Jamie at her house, where they share their first kiss on her porch. Afterward, Landon asks Hegbert if they can go to Flavin's, a local restaurant, on New Year's Eve. While Hegbert initially refuses, after Landon declares his love for Jamie, Hegbert allows it.
On New Year's Jamie and Landon go to dinner, where they share their first dance. A couple of weeks later, Landon tells Jamie that he is in love with her. To his surprise, Jamie replies by insisting that he cannot be. In response, Landon demands an explanation, and Jamie reveals that she is dying of leukemia. 
The following Sunday, Hegbert announces to his congregation that his daughter is dying. Jamie does not return to school the following Monday and that it is eventually learned that she is too ill and will never return to school. While they are having dinner at Landon's house, Jamie tells Landon, "I love you, too," for the first time. A couple weeks later, Eric and Margaret visit Jamie's house, where they apologize for ever being rude to her. Eric gives Jamie the $400 that he collected for the orphanage. Jamie refuses to stay at the hospital, because she wants to die at home. In turn, Landon's father helps to provide Jamie the best equipment and doctors so she can spend the rest of her life at home. This gesture helps to mend the gap between father and son. One day, while sitting next to Jamie while she sleeps, Landon comes up with an idea. He runs to the church to find Hegbert and asks him for permission to marry Jamie. While Hegbert is reluctant, his refusal to deny Landon's request is seen by Landon as approval. Landon runs back to Jamie's side and asks, "Will you marry me?"
Landon and Jamie are married in a church full of people. Although she was weak and was in a wheelchair, she insisted on walking down the aisle so that her father could give her away which was part of her dream. Landon remembers thinking "It was...the most difficult walk anyone ever had to make. In every way, a walk to remember." When they reach the front of the church, Hegbert says, "I can no more give Jamie away than I can give away my heart. But what I can do is let another share in the joy that she has always given me." Hegbert has had to experience so much pain in his life, first losing his wife, now knowing his only child will soon be gone, too. The book ends with Landon 40 years later at age 57. He still loves Jamie and wears her ring. He finishes the story by saying, "I now believe, by the way, that miracles can happen."
Reception.
The novel was published in the fall of October 1999 in hardcover print, and later in paperback edition. It spent nearly six months in the best-seller list on hardcover, and an additional four months on paperback.
The novel received mixed reviews from critics. The "Sunday New York Post" holds that it "never fails to be interesting, touching, at times riveting ... a book you won't soon forget". "African Sun Times" echoes the former's comments, saying, "A remarkable love story that, like its predecessors, will touch the hearts of readers everywhere." "New York Daily News" compliments Sparks, commenting that he "has written a sweet tale of young but everlasting love, and though he's told us to expect both joy and sadness, the tears will still come". Clarissa Cruz of "Entertainment Weekly", however, panned the novel, saying, "With its cliche-riddled prose and plot twists that can be predicted after skimming the prologue, Nicholas Sparks' latest, "A Walk To Remember", reads more like the script for a bad after-school special than anything approaching literature." Although the novel is number 12 on their list of 1999 Bestsellers Fiction, "Publishers Weekly" described it as "a forced coming of age story" and "the author's most simple, formulaic, and blatantly melodramatic package to date". Theresea Parks from Publishers Weekly goes on to say how many will be disappointed stating, "Readers may be frusturated with the invariable formula that Sparks seems to regurgitate with regularity". She also writes that it is especially similar to "The Notebook" in its "corny flashback device that mimics "The Notebook"". Overall, Publishers Weekly expressed its disappointment.
Adaptation.
"A Walk to Remember" was adapted in the film of the same name, becoming Sparks' second novel adapted to the big screen after "Message in a Bottle" in 1999. Sparks sold the film rights to Warner Bros. in December 1998, months before the publication of the novel. The movie was directed by Adam Shankman and produced by Denise DiNovi and Hunt Lowry for Warner Bros.; the film premiered on January 25, 2002.
The film, starring singer and actress Mandy Moore (Jamie) and Shane West (Landon), is set in the late 1990s. Sparks and the producer thought that because the film was suitable for teenagers "because of the message it provided", they had to make the adaptation more contemporary.

William Forst House

The William Forst House, also known as the Clark House and the First-Clark House, is a historic house located in the Russellville Historic District of Russellville, Kentucky. Built in 1820, it made history between November 18 and 20, 1861, as the site where the Confederate government of Kentucky was formed. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since July 19, 1973.
Description.
The House is a two-story, five-bay, Federal style building made of brick. It presently has ten interior rooms. When first built, there were only five rooms and a hall. These were three rooms and hall on the first floor, and on the second floor a ballroom and another room. As there were still fears of Indian attacks when the structure was built, there are no windows on the side of the building.
The property has seen various changes over the years. In 1890 the interior staircase was replaced. The original kitchen, servant's quarters, and white-column front porch are long gone. A double-brick stairplace takes the place of the porch. In 1964 additions were added for the continued use of the Clark family.
History.
The structure was built in 1820 by William First, later having his name altered to Forst, an immigrant from England believed to be a cabinetmaker. He built the home to show his expertise in millwork and mantels. In November 1861, the Confederate Sovereignty Committee met at the house. Its 116 delegates from 65 Kentucky counties voted to secede from the Union, although the state capital at Frankfort, Kentucky was still in existence and chose to stay in the Union. Before leaving the home, George W. Johnson was elected by the delegates as the Confederate governor of Kentucky.
From 1922 to 1942 it was used as a funeral home, under the ownership of Wister C. Clark. His widow turned the ballroom into apartments in 1960, and the bottom floor used as a law office for her son and his law partner.

Plot.
Kantatar (Barbed Wire) revolves around the journey of Sudha (Sreelekha Mitra),A socio-political-love drama, Kantatar centers on an illegal immigrant’s search for identity and her effort to survive sake and in search of an identity, moves from one man to another and from one religion to another. The sudden threat of cross border terrorism entirely changes the socio-political situation in a remote village close to the frontier, the army rolls into town, and the drastic changes take their toll on inter-personal relationships as they are marred by suspicion, competition and fear. Sudha takes refuge in a temporary weather camp just outside the village. She develops a physical relationship with Binod (Sudip Mukherjee), the weather balloonist, whose job it is to take note of the frequent change of wind direction. But soon Sudha's identity comes into question and she is seen as a suspect. Her dream of a secure shelter is once again threatened. This is a beautiful and engaging film, which luxuriates in the story and its location. The visual poetry and unfettered exploration of the ongoing conflict on the borders of India and Bangladesh come together with great impact and insight. There are brilliant touches of both satire and social comment, which go to show that Bappaditya Bandhopadhay has a lot to say about today's India. Sudha’s hard life consists of weaving herself in and out of different relationships with men and dabbling in various religions. The immediate threat of attack entirely changes the climate of her remote border village, and as the army rolls into town, inter-personal relationships are drastically affected. Suspicion, competition and fear start to grip the villagers. Sudha takes refuge in a temporary weather camp just outside the village. Binod, a meteorologist working in the village, becomes fascinated by Sudha, and they soon begin a physical relationship. But when Sudha's identity is called into question, she is seen as a terrorist suspect. Her dreams of security are once again threatened. Kantatar is visually engaging, luxuriating in the lush locales where it was filmed. Director Bappaditya Bandhopadhay relies on both satire and social comment to tell his story, all the while exploring the ongoing conflict on the borders of India and Bangladesh. Modern India is portrayed with great impact and insight.

Chickenfoot

Chickenfoot is a supergroup of U.S. origin. The group consists of vocalist Sammy Hagar (ex-Van Halen and Montrose), bassist Michael Anthony (also ex–Van Halen), guitarist Joe Satriani, and drummer Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers). Their first album was released on June 5, 2009 in Europe and June 7 in the U.S.
While the band's name and logo are a disparaging term for the peace symbol, the "footprint of the chicken," bassist Michael Anthony asserts that the name originated from initial jam sessions between Hagar, Smith and himself: "there are three talons on a chicken’s foot and there three of us." Later Anthony stated: "it was just supposed to be a bullshit name that we’d used for a while, and then [when the rumors spread about the band, everybody used that name so we thought, 'fuck it, let’s call it Chickenfoot' – it all comes down to the music anyway." Chickenfoot's second studio album, "Chickenfoot III", was released on September 27, 2011.
History.
Formation and self-titled debut album (2009–2010).
According to vocalist Sammy Hagar: " started off with me, Michael Anthony and Chad Smith jamming at my club, Cabo Wabo, in Mexico. Then people started asking us when we were going to tour, make a record, etc. So I said if we’re going to do this properly then we’re going have to get a guitarist, so let’s talk to Joe Satriani. As far as I’m concerned he’s the best guitarist in the world." Hagar, Anthony and Satriani had previously collaborated in 2002 under the name Planet Us.
The band's first performance together was in February 2008 at a Hagar concert in The Pearl Concert Theatre @ The Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The show included a three song set which included Led Zeppelin's "Rock and Roll", Traffic's "Dear Mr. Fantasy" and "Going Down", a song often performed by Hagar and Anthony in their other band, Los Tres Gusanos. Regarding the show, bassist Michael Anthony states: "At that point, we knew the chemistry was there. It was so much fun, and the instant gratification from the audience was great. We decided to take the next step and see what we could do. It was just too much fun to pass up."
During breaks in Satriani's touring schedule, the four-piece gathered in Hagar's home to record demos, and ultimately recorded a full-length album at Skywalker Sound.
The band's eponymous debut album, "Chickenfoot," was released on June 4, 2009. On its release date, Chickenfoot performed the single "Oh Yeah!" on "The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien". Chickenfoot subsequently began touring in Europe and America.
In October 2009, Smith reconvened with the Red Hot Chili Peppers to begin work on their tenth studio album, ultimately causing Chickenfoot to enter a temporary hiatus. Despite this, the band still appeared on television once more to perform "Sexy Little Thing" and "Oh Yeah" on the November 6, 2009 broadcast of Jimmy Kimmel Live! (taped November 5). Smith stated: 
This is also stated on the interview with Chad Smith on MusicRadar.com, posted on August 24, 2009:
"Chickenfoot III" (2010–present).
As a guest on VH1 Classic's "That Metal Show" on April 17, 2010 Joe Satriani confirmed that a second Chickenfoot album was in the works, that he and Sammy Hagar had gotten together for several writing sessions, and that with any luck it would be released in 2010. In the same month, Chickenfoot voiced themselves on an episode of "Aqua Teen Hunger Force".
On May 6, 2010, Chad Smith confirmed that Chickenfoot would be recording their second album in the fall of 2010 after he completes the recording of the next Red Hot Chili Peppers album. Around the same time, Satriani confirmed that a number of songs had been written, including one called "Come Closer," which began simply as a piano and vocal number.
On September 3, 2010, Chickenfoot announced that they were gearing up to record their second album. Although Chad Smith participated in the recording, the band would have to consider a different drummer for touring purposes, as Smith along with the rest of the Red Hot Chili Peppers were about to release their next album "I'm with You" on August 30, 2011 and will follow it up with a subsequent tour. The band said they are considering plans to audition different drummers and possibly find a drummer to fill in for Smith. Joe Satriani stated that he would love to have Tommy Lee fill in for Chad. Some other names that have been in consideration are Abe Laboriel, Jr. from Paul McCartney's band, Velvet Revolver's Matt Sorum, Pantera and Hellyeah's Vinnie Paul and Jason Bonham.
On October 15, 2010, Chad discussed his future with Chickenfoot and said that although he and the rest of the band planned to enter the studio in January 2011, he would be unable to tour in support of the next Chickenfoot album because of the Chili Peppers' new album and subsequent touring.
On January 21, 2011, Michael Anthony confirmed that the band would enter the studio on January 29, 2011, along with Chad Smith who will record the drums for the album, though as stated before, he will not be touring with the band due to his commitments with Red Hot Chili Peppers.
On March 11, 2011, Sammy Hagar confirmed that the band had been recording with Mike Fraser, a Canadian producer, engineer, and mixer. He also confirmed that they had 12 songs worked up and that some of titles are, 'No Change,' 'Who's Next,' 'Astral Years,' and 'I Ain't Got You, I Got The Two By Blues.' The official title for the new album is "Chickenfoot III" (three). Sammy Hagar says "It's the working title, but I guarantee it'll stick.", "Chickenfoot III" is due to be released in fall 2011 with the album cover being in 3-D. Hagar also stated the band are also planning to do a third, fourth, and greatest hits albums sometime in the future. Joe Satriani recently confirmed that "Come Closer" and a song called "Setting Sun" are to also be on "Chickenfoot III" Joe Satriani also sent an email on May 3, 2011 to all his fans saying that "Chickenfoot III" was almost finished and the band were hoping to mix the album in June 2011. On May 22, Chad Smith tweeted that he had just finished cutting the last 2 songs for the album.
On June 19, 2011, in an interview with Joe Satriani, he revealed that the new album is due out in October. Satriani also confirmed that the band will do a select number of shows in the fall, and hopefully more in February 2012. The band must work around Sammy and Chad's other schedules.
The next day, on June 20, 2011, on his birthday, Michael Anthony confirmed that the mixing for the new album has been completed, with the first single from the new album expected to hit radio airways this summer, and the full enchilada to follow in October.
On June 30, 2011, Michael Anthony told the Van Halen News Desk directly, that the new album will be released on September 27, 2011. The first single from the album, to be released on August 2, 2011, is titled "Bigfoot".
On July 6, 2011, it was announced that the band signed a new distribution deal with eOne Music in North America. Also, the title for the new album was confirmed to be "Chickenfoot III". On July 8, 2011, the band posted a teaser of one of their new songs online with this message: "Attention Foot Soldiers... Get Your Boots On".
Michael Anthony has confirmed that the band plan to tour in the fall of 2011, supporting the release of "Chickenfoot III". He said the band are still not sure about a temporary replacement drummer for Chad Smith, though they may play some shows with Chad, and some shows with another drummer filling in for Chad while he is on tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
According to Satriani, it is likely that Kenny Aronoff will take over the drumming duties from Smith for the tour promoting the second album, due to the latter's commitments with Red Hot Chili Peppers. This was confirmed on August 27.
The band announced that "Big Foot", the first single off the second album, would make its online debut July 31, 2011, with the single being released to radio and iTunes on August 1, 2011.
On September 24, 2011, Sammy Hagar appeared on That Metal Show on VH1 Classic and admitted that Chickenfoot decided to name their second album "Chickenfoot III" to avoid the dreaded second album drop-off experienced by most bands. He said they just decided to "skip" the second album and make the third album.
On September 27, for the release of III, the band played a live concert via webcast from TRI Studios in California. A fan Q&A followed the performance. They also played a show at the Cabo Wabo Cantina in Mexico on October 9, 2011.
The band have recently finished a 10 date Road test tour with Kenny Aronoff, 5 dates in the US, and 5 in Europe. They have also recently performed "Different Devil" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
The 2012 "Different Devil" summer US tour started on May 4 in South Lake Tahoe, and includes at least 20 dates.
It was announced on August 28, 2012, that since Chickenfoot's former record label went out of business, and the debut album couldn't be found anywhere, they are re-releasing the debut album with eOne music with bonus live tracks "Lighten Up", "Big Foot", "Last Temptation", and "Something Going Wrong", recorded during the Different Devil tour of Spring 2012.
On November 30, 2012, Chickenfoot's first live album LV was released as part of the Limited Edition Boxset "I+III+LV" paired with their first and second album in their "Limited Edition" releases. on December 7, 2012, LV will also see a release on its own.

Gammanpila was active in politics since his schooling days at D. S. Senanayake College where it is alleged that he actively participated in the 1987–89 Insurrection by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, he has neither admitted nor denied this fact, however his principal of the school at the time, R I T Alles, has mentioned in his autobiography “My Life” that Udaya actively participated in the JVP organized student protests. he has claimed that he was a student leader of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka.
Having obtained the highest marks in the country's Advance Level examination in the commerce stream in 1988 he won a scholarship to study Computer Science at Monash University . He was a teaching assistant while as an undergraduate and became a member of Australian Computer Society. Later he became an Attorney at Law. After graduation, he joined the corporate sector as a Management Trainee and became the Chief Executive Officer of Australia Lanka Group at the age of 26.
Gammanpila entered politics in 2000 as a founding member of Sinhala ultra-nationalist political party and was appointed as the Propaganda Secretary and spokesperson for Sihala Urumaya in December 2000 soon after the internal rift which caused 7 out of 15 Central Committee members to leave the party including the much respected party chairman S L Gunasekera and two deputy chairmen.

Yellowspotted trevally

The yellowspotted trevally, "Carangoides fulvoguttatus" (also known as the goldspotted trevally and tarrum) is a widespread species of large inshore marine fish in the jack family Carangidae. The yellowspotted trevally inhabits the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-west Pacific region, from South Africa in the west to Japan and Australia in the east. The species is known to obtain a maximum length of at least 1.2 m, and is distinguished by gill raker and fin morphology, as well as the distinctive golden spots which give the fish its name. The yellowspotted trevally generally prefers inshore rocky and coral reefs, but is occasionally found over deep offshore sand banks to a depth of 100 m. It is a predatory fish, taking fish, cephalopods and crustaceans, and shows diet partitioning with other trevallies in studies conducted in Australian waters. Reproduction is poorly studied, although observational evidence suggests spawning occurs in aggregations, probably during summer in South Africa. It is generally of minor importance to commercial fisheries throughout its range, but is considered an excellent sportfish by anglers and spearfishermen and a good table fish.
Taxonomy and naming.
The yellowspotted trevally is classified within the genus "Carangoides", a group of fish commonly known as jacks and trevallies. Carangoides falls into the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, itself part the order Perciformes, in the suborder Percoidei.
The species was first described by the naturalist Peter Forsskål in 1775 based on the holotype specimen taken from the waters of the Red Sea. He named the species "Scomber fulvoguttatus", relating the species to the true mackerels, as during this period the family Carangidae had yet to be established. The species was later transferred to "Caranx" and then to "Carangoides", where it has remained. The species was independently renamed a number of times, the first as "Tarrum emburyi" by Gilbert Percy Whitley, a name which was commonly used and later transferred into "Caranx" and "Carangoides". Some fifteen years later, Whitley again assigned the fish to a new species and genus name, "Ferdauia claeszooni", but this genus was soon synonymised with "Carangoides" and this name, as well as "Tarrum emburyi" were shown to be junior synonyms of "Carangoides fulvoguttatus". The common name 'Tarrum' is still used in Australia for the fish, but is also widely misapplied to similar species.
Description.
The yellowspotted trevally is a large fish, growing to at least 1.2 m in length and reaching a recorded maximum weight of 18 kg. The yellowspotted trevally has a body shape more like the jacks of the genus "Caranx", being more elongated and subcylindrical than most of the genus "Carangoides". As a juvenile, the fish is more subovate, becoming more elongated with age, with the dorsal profile of the head and nape becoming steeper with age also. The dorsal fin is in two distinct parts, the first consisting of 8 spines while the second is composed of 1 spines and 25 to 30 soft rays, with the anterior lobe of this fin being shorter than the head length. The anal fin has two anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine attached to 21 to 26 soft rays and the pelvic fin has 1 spine and 18 to 19 soft rays. The lateral line has a gentle anterior arch which is slightly longer than the straight section of the lateral line, with the intersection below the thirteenth to sixteenth soft ray of the dorsal fin. The curved section contains 80 to 88 scales while the straight section consists of 12 to 17 scales and 26 to 31 scutes. The breast is scaleless until the origin of the pelvic fins and up to the origin of the pectoral fins, although some individuals have a narrow band of scales separating the pectoral fins. In adults, the mouth cleft is directly beneath the eye, with the both jaws containing bands of villiform teeth. There are 22 to 27 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae.
The juveniles of the yellowspotted trevally are uniformly silver with a few golden spots above the lateral line, with upper body becoming a more iridescent blue green with increasing age. At adulthood there are many small golden to brassy spots above the midline with large individuals also having 3 irregular, indistinct dark blotches on the flank. There is an inconspicuous dusky spot on the operculum, and it may be completely absent. The dorsal and anal fins are dusky yellow, with the anal fin having a whitish blue leading edge and distal margin. The pectoral and caudal fins are olive yellow, becoming dusky at the edges, while the pelvic fin is whitish blue.
Distribution and habitat.
The yellowspotted trevally is broadly distributed in tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-pacific region. The species ranges from South Africa in the west, north to the Red Sea and India, and is distributed throughout South East Asia and the Indonesian island chain. Its range extends south to northern Australia, north to Taiwan and Japan and as far east as Palau, Tonga and New Caledonia in the Pacific. 
The yellowspotted trevally predominantly inhabits inshore lagoons and rocky or coral reef systems, although is occasionally found in seagrass meadows, around offshore islands and on deep sand banks to depths of around 100 m. It is intolerant of low salinities and as such does not enter estuaries.
Biology and fishery.
The yellowspotted trevally lives either solitarily or in large schools, with smaller groups often patrolling the edges of reefs in search of food and large solitary fish are known to patrol seagrass beds in search of prey. The species diet consists of small fish such as anchovies, a wide range of crustaceans including swimming crabs, mantis shrimp and prawns as well as cephalopods such as squid. Preliminary dietary information collected from the North West Shelf of Australia shows that "C. fulvoguttatus" and "C. gymnostethus" inhabit very similar habitats, and are able to do so by partitioning their diet, with "C. fulvoguttatus" taking more fish and cephalopods while "C. gymnostethus" predominantly takes crustaceans. The only data on reproduction in the species comes from Palau, where large spawning aggregations form in the third quarter of the lunar month. Spawning takes place in South Africa over the summer.
The yellowspotted trevally is of moderate importance to fisheries throughout its range, although catch statistics are rarely kept for this species specifically. One exception is Saudi Arabia, with the FAO reporting a yearly catch of between 128 and 324 tonnes between 2000 and 2004, with no apparent trends in the catch data. The species is taken by hook and line, gill nets and various traps. The yellowspotted trevally is also of major importance to anglers and spearfishermen in some countries, with the species highly valued in Australia and South Africa. Surveys of recreational catches in the Pilbara region of Western Australia indicate around 5 tonnes of fish are taken every year, with around 3 tonnes kept for consumption or use as bait. Fish are mostly caught from boats using small baits including fish and crab, as well as lures including minnows, metal slugs, soft plastic lures and even saltwater flies. It is an excellent gamefish, with young fish also considered good table fish, becoming somewhat dry with age. The yellowspotted trevally is also considered a good candidate for aquaculture in the future.

<doc id="19918654" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19918654" title="Education economics">
Education economics

Education economics or the economics of education is the study of economic issues relating to education, including the demand for education and the financing and provision of education. From early works on the relationship between schooling and labor market outcomes for individuals, the field of the economics of education has grown rapidly to cover virtually all areas with linkages to education.
Education as an investment.
Economics distinguishes in addition to physical capital another form of capital that is no less critical as a means of production – human capital. With investments in human capital, such as education, three major economic effects can be expected:
Investment costs.
Investments in human capital entail an investment cost, just as any investment does. Typically in European countries most education expenditure takes the form of government consumption, although some costs are also born by individuals. These investments can be rather costly. EU governments spent between 3% and 8% of GDP on education in 2005, the average being 5%.
However, measuring the spending this way alone greatly underestimates the costs because a more subtle form of costs is completely overlooked: the opportunity cost of forgone wages as students cannot work while they study. It has been estimated that the total costs, including opportunity costs, of education are as much as double the direct costs.
Including opportunity costs investments in education can be estimated to have been around 10% of GDP in the EU countries in 2005. In comparison investments in physical capital were 20% of GDP. Thus the two are of similar magnitude.
Returns on investment.
Human capital in the form of education shares many characteristics with physical capital. Both require an investment to create and, once created, both have economic value. Physical capital earns a return because people are willing to pay to use a piece of physical capital in work as it allows them to produce more output. To measure the productive value of physical capital, we can simply measure how much of a return it commands in the market. In the case of human capital calculating returns is more complicated – after all, we cannot separate education from the person to see how much it rents for.
To get around this problem the returns to human capital are generally inferred from differences in wages among people with different levels of education. Hall and Jones have calculated from international data that on average that the returns on education are 13.4% per year for first four years of schooling (grades 1–4), 10.1% per year for the next four years (grades 5–8) and 6.8% for each year beyond eight years. Thus someone with 12 years of schooling can be expected to earn, on average, 1.1344 × 1.1014 × 1.0684 = 3.161 times as much as someone with no schooling at all.
Effects on productivity.
Economy-wide, the effect of human capital on incomes has been estimated to be rather significant: 65% of wages paid in developed countries is payments to human capital and only 35% to raw labor. The higher productivity of well-educated workers is one of the factors that explain higher GDPs and, therefore, higher incomes in developed countries. A strong correlation between GDP and education is clearly visible among the countries of the world, as is shown by the upper left figure. It is less clear, however, how much of a high GDP is explained by education. After all, it is also possible that rich countries can simply afford more education.
To distinguish the part of GDP explained with education from other causes, Weil has calculated how much one would expect each country’s GDP to be higher based on the data on average schooling. This was based on the above mentioned calculations of Hall and Jones on the returns on education. GDPs predicted by Weil’s calculations can be plotted against actual GDPs, as is done in the figure on the left, demonstrating that the variation in education explains some, but not all, of the variation in GDP.
Finally, the matter of externalities should be considered. Usually when speaking of externalities one thinks of the negative effects of economic activities that are not included in market prices, such as pollution. These are negative externalities. However, there are also positive externalities – that is, positive effects of which someone can benefit without having to pay for it.
Education bears with it major positive externalities: giving one person more education raises not only his or her output but also the output of those around him or her. Educated workers can bring new technologies, methods and information to the consideration of others. They can teach things to others and act as an example.
Positive externalities from human capital are one explanation for why governments are involved in education. If people were left on their own, they would not take into account the full social benefit of education – in other words the rise in the output and wages of others – so the amount they would choose to obtain would be lower than the social optimum.
Demand for education.
Liberal approaches.
The dominant model of the demand for education is based on human capital theory. The central idea is that undertaking education is investment in the acquisition of skills and knowledge which will increase earnings, or provide long-term benefits such as an appreciation of literature (sometimes referred to as cultural capital). An increase in human capital can follow technological progress as knowledgeable employees are in demand due to the need for their skills, whether it be in understanding the production process or in operating machines. Studies from 1958 attempted to calculate the returns from additional schooling (the percent increase in income acquired through an additional year of schooling). Later results attempted to allow for different returns across persons or by level of education.
Statistics have shown that countries with high enrollment/graduation rates have grown faster than countries without. The United States has been the world leader in educational advances, beginning with the high school movement (1910–1950). There also seems to be a correlation between gender differences in education with the level of growth; more development is observed in countries which have an equal distribution of the percentage of women versus men who graduated from high school. When looking at correlations in the data, education seems to generate economic growth; however, it could be that we have this causality relationship backwards. For example, if education is seen as a luxury good, it may be that richer households are seeking out educational attainment as a symbol of status, rather than the relationship of education leading to wealth.
Educational advance is not the only variable for economic growth, though, as it only explains about 14% of the average annual increase in labor productivity over the period 1915-2005. From lack of a more significant correlation between formal educational achievement and productivity growth, some economists see reason to believe that in today’s world many skills and capabilities come by way of learning outside of tradition education, or outside of schooling altogether.
An alternative model of the demand for education, commonly referred to as screening, is based on the economic theory of signalling. The central idea is that the successful completion of education is a signal of ability.
Marxist critique.
Although Marx and Engels did not write widely about the social functions of education, their concepts and methods are theorized and criticized by the influence of Marx as education being used in reproduction of capitalist societies. Marx and Engels approached scholarship as "revolutionary scholarship" where education should serve as a propaganda for the struggle of the working class. The classical Marxian paradigm sees education as serving the interest of capital and is seeking alternative modes of education that would prepare students and citizens for more progressive socialist mode of social organizations. Marx and Engels understood education and free time as essential to developing free individuals and creating many-sided human beings, thus for them education should become a more essential part of the life of people unlike capitalist society which is organized mainly around work and the production of commodities.
Financing and provision.
In most countries school education is predominantly financed and provided by governments. Public funding and provision also plays a major role in higher education. Although there is wide agreement on the principle that education, at least at school level, should be financed mainly by governments, there is considerable debate over the desirable extent of public provision of education. Supporters of public education argue that universal public provision promotes equality of opportunity and social cohesion. Opponents of public provision advocate alternatives such as vouchers.
Education production function.
An "education production function" is an application of the economic concept of a production function to the field of education. It relates various inputs affecting a student’s learning (schools, families, peers, neighborhoods, etc.) to measured outputs including subsequent labor market success, college attendance, graduation rates, and, most frequently, standardized test scores. The original study that eventually prompted interest in the idea of education production functions was by a sociologist, James S. Coleman. The Coleman Report, published in 1966, concluded that the marginal effect of various school inputs on student achievement was small compared to the impact of families and friends. Later work, by Eric A. Hanushek, Richard Murnane, and other economists introduced the structure of "production" to the consideration of student learning outcomes.
A large number of successive studies, increasingly involving economists, produced inconsistent results about the impact of school resources on student performance, leading to considerable controversy in policy discussions. The interpretation of the various studies has been very controversial, in part because the findings have directly influenced policy debates. Two separate lines of study have been particularly widely debated. The overall question of whether added funds to schools are likely to produce higher achievement (the “money doesn’t matter” debate) has entered into legislative debates and court consideration of school finance systems. Additionally, policy discussions about class size reduction heightened academic study of the relationship of class size and achievement.

Irish experiment

The Irish Experiment is the popular name for the interest, primarily from VFL/AFL clubs, in bringing Irish Gaelic footballers over to Australia to play Australian rules football professionally. The AFL's focus on Gaelic footballers is due to the similarities between the sports.
The Irish Experiment began in the mid-1980s as an informal project of the Melbourne Football Club. Despite its initial success, enthusiasm for the project lapsed until the 2000s, when it again became ongoing and currently increasing due to globalisation and professionalism in sport.
The highest profile product of the experiment to date has been Medal of the Order of Australia and Brownlow Medal recipient Jim Stynes, who was an early recruit. Irishman Tadhg Kennelly was a key player in the Sydney Swans 2005 AFL Grand Final victory. The highest profile Gaelic footballer to sign an AFL contract is Tommy Walsh.
Over the years the Irish experiment has attracted media and public interest in both Ireland and Australia.
History.
Early interactions between the VFL/AFL and GAA.
In 1967, Harry Beitzel drew inspiration from watching the 1966 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final on television and formed an Australian side, nicknamed "The Galahs", to play the game against an Irish side. The next year he organised The Australian Football World Tour, a six-match series with games played against Irish teams in Ireland, the United Kingdom and United States of America. What followed was the beginning of regular interaction between the two codes which was to become the hybrid code of International Rules Football.
Beginnings of the Irish Experiment.
Ron Barassi, drawing comparisons between Australian rules football and Gaelic football was of the opinion that Gaelic Footballers could provide a previously untapped pool of potential Australian Rules players. At the time, Australian Rules was, with the introduction of the Sydney Swans, increasing its national focus and emerging from a semi-professional sport to a fully professional one. As a result, wealthy Victorian clubs were scouting the country far and wide for new talent to gain an advantage in the sport's premier competition. In 1982, Barassi (then the Melbourne VFL club coach) and his recruiting team including Melbourne's Barry Richardson travelled to Ireland, looking for young, tall, and talented players.
The first recruit was Sean Wight. Further advertising resulted in the recruitment of a "tall, skinny lad", Jim Stynes. Both Wight and Stynes, still very much learning the game, played together in the club's 1987 night premiership. While Stynes captured the Melbourne reserves best and fairest that year, he also involved in an embarrassing event which cast doubts on the Irish experiment. His lack of understanding of the rules single-handedly cost Melbourne a berth in the 1987 VFL Grand Final. The infamous Preliminary Final incident in which he ran over the mark before the siren made him and the Irish experiment the focus of Melbourne media. The mistake awarded Hawthorn's Gary Buckenara a 15-metre penalty which resulted in a winning goal to qualify for the Grand Final. Despite the setback, Stynes and Wight were both to improve in the following seasons and become regular senior players.
Other clubs watched the Irish experiment's mixed bag of success and failure warily. St Kilda was the only other club to attempt to convert a gaelic footballer, Dermot McNicholl. McNicholl's decision to return home after 3 matches with the club helped to fuel the notion that the Irish experiment would attract few stayers. 
Despite the Melbourne Football Club's enthusiasm for the Irish experiment and early success with some Irish players, the majority of players from the Irish Experiment did not fare as well. Most failed to meet expectations, not make VFL level, and many instead returned home to Ireland.
Wight and Stynes both featured in the 1988 VFL Grand Final. However despite high expectations Melbourne was convincingly thrashed by Hawthorn, then the dominant club of the era. However, Stynes was voted best on field for the Demons. Hawthorn's emerging champion Dermott Brereton, of Irish descent, dominated from centre-half forward with a haul of 5 goals.
A much improved Jim Stynes won the Brownlow Medal in 1991, elevating him in the elite category of players for many years to come. However the rare successes were increasingly seen as "one offs" and other clubs showed little enthusiasm with the "hit and miss" strategy. Melbourne, the trailblazer club was not translating recruitment into onfield success and was fast losing financial resources that were required to sustain international recruitment. As a result, few AFL clubs recruited Gaelic footballers played at the highest level in the 1990s. Even the recruitment of Jim Stynes' brother Brian yielded just a handful of unimpressive senior games.
With the increasing professionalism of the AFL competition, some clubs continued to speculate about the overseas talent pool. Kevin Sheedy in particular conducted a series of his own experiments with overseas players from various sporting backgrounds, but did not include Ireland or gaelic football. Despite generating media publicity, none of these experiments were ultimately successful and increasingly sections of the Australian media began to mock the idea of international recruitment.
2000s revival.
The Irish experiment lay dormant for many years until Melbourne once again began to take an interest in it. The Sydney Swans followed with the recruitment of Tadhg Kennelly through its rookie list. Kennelly was an almost overnight success, being nominated for the AFL Rising Star award in his first season and widely hailed by the media. As a result other clubs began to show a much keener interest in Irish talent.
With access to additional resources, AFL clubs began to spend more time and effort in identifying and training athletic and talented rookies. Collingwood, Carlton and Brisbane in particular began to show an interest and hold scouting sessions and tryouts for Irish players.
Carlton followed and its experiments with Setanta and Aisake Ó hAilpín began to bear fruit and attract significant media interest in both Australia and Ireland. These experiments were of particular note, as for the first time a club was looking to other sports than gaelic football, by identifying talented hurling athletes with the right ingredients to become AFL players.
2007 onwards.
With Gaelic footballer Colm Begley's rapid conversion at Brisbane and Martin Clarke's successful AFL debut, media commentators hailed a new era for the Irish experiment. During the 2007 AFL season several AFL clubs began sending talent scouts to Ireland.
In March 2008, it was revealed by the media that the AFL had considered a radical proposal to launch an Irish-dominated team in Sydney's western suburbs, which would perform before an international audience under the Celtic brand name. The "Sydney Celtics" plan was first put to AFL chief executive Andrew Demetriou in early 2007 by Gaelic Players Association executive Donal O'Neill. It was said that the proposal originated at the International Rules series in Ireland in late 2006 where O'Neill put forward a plan to purchase an AFL licence in Sydney. However, the AFL later dismissed it as simple speculation.
Mid 2008, the interest of clubs reached a peak and Tadhg Kennelly and Jim Stynes spoke out about the increasing recruitment activity. AFL player manager Ricky Nixon set up recruitment networks in Ireland to complement those already in place by clubs such as Collingwood, Carlton and Brisbane. Nickey Brennan, GAA boss spoke out against the recruitment activity in June 2008. The AFL and GAA had ongoing discussions about putting limits on the recruitment of players.
Despite the rise of former hurler Setanta Ó hAilpín in the AFL, recruitment interest in Ireland began to wane in mid-2010. Several Irish players cancelled their rookie contracts to return home, others were delisted after brief bouts in the various state leagues. With a media circus surrounding the recruitment of Karmichael Hunt to the Gold Coast Football Club and Israel Folau to the Greater Western Sydney Football Club focus began to shift to other sports, particularly rugby football as a potential source of talent. With the success of Canadian rugby union player Mike Pyke's conversion and many other players transitioning at junior level the AFL and commentators began to speculate that professional rugby league players might make an easier transition to the AFL due to coming from a high-contact professional sport involving an oval ball.
List of Irish sportsmen linked with the VFL/AFL.
This list includes any player who at minimum (regardless of whether he ever went to Australia or played actual VFL/AFL matches) meets any one of the following criteria:

Hurricane Baker (1950)

Hurricane Baker was a major hurricane that affected the Leeward Islands, Greater Antilles, and the Gulf Coast of the United States. The tropical cyclone was the second intense hurricane, second hurricane, and second tropical storm of the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Baker attained peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) near the Leeward Islands, traversed Antigua, and weakened to a tropical depression southwest of Puerto Rico. It re-intensified south of Cuba, strengthened to a strong Category 2 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, and hit the United States near Gulf Shores, Alabama, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). Hurricane Baker produced extensive damage in the Lesser Antilles and Cuba, but impacts were minimal in the United States.
Meteorological history.
On the morning of August 20, a strong tropical storm developed about 446 miles (718 km) east of Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe. The tropical storm deepened to hurricane intensity. On August 21, it rapidly attained maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h), equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane. The hurricane passed over Antigua during the evening, while still producing winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). On August 22, it lost intensity and weakened to a tropical storm. On August 23, Baker made landfall near the Puerto Rican town of Guánica as a minimal tropical storm. The highest winds on the island of Puerto Rico were 35–40 mph (55–65 km/h). The storm then degenerated into an easterly tropical wave, and moved west-northwestward over northeastern Hispaniola. On August 24, it re-entered the Atlantic Ocean, and Tropical Depression Baker crossed the coast of eastern Cuba early on the next day.
On August 25, Baker redeveloped a center over the Caribbean Sea off southern Cuba, and re-intensified to tropical storm status. On August 27, Baker affected the Pinar del Río Province with 60 mph (75 km/h) winds, and then turned northward over the southern Gulf of Mexico. On August 28, Baker re-strengthened to hurricane intensity; reconnaissance and ship reports suggest the hurricane attained a second peak intensity of 110 mph (175 km/h) on August 30. The minimum central pressure was 979 mbar (28.92 inHg) on this date. The cyclone diminished in intensity prior to landfall. On August 31, the hurricane struck Gulf Shores, Alabama as a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds estimated near 85 mph (140 km/h). The estimated central pressure at landfall was 980 mbar (28.95 inHg). Baker moved inland over Alabama and dissipated over southeastern Missouri on September 1.
Impact.
On Antigua, the Pan American Airways station's power failed when winds reached 85 mph (140 km/h) around midnight on August 22. Unofficial estimates placed winds between 95–120 mph (150–195 km/h) at the location, although damages and casualties were unknown. Subsequent reports indicated light damage occurred on the island; later, information from the island indicated extensive damage. More than 100 homes were destroyed or damaged in the Willkie and Piggott areas, and large homes were destroyed in Prestown. Additionally, a manse was also demolished in Prestown. Electronic communications were dismantled, and thousands of homeless people sheltered in churches and schools. No deaths occurred on the island, but damages were expected to reach several thousand dollars. In Cuba, 37 people died, and the property losses reached several million dollars.
In the United States, the greatest property and crop damage occurred from Mobile, Alabama to Saint Marks, Florida, where losses approached $2,550,000 (1950 USD); high tides and winds inflicted minimal damage in both cities. Panama City, Florida incurred heavy damage to homes and businesses from high tides and rainfall, which peaked at . The highest rainfall total was at Caryville, Florida. Peak gusts exceeded 100 mph (155 km/h) on Santa Rosa Island, Florida. 200 to 300 cottages received damage in Panama City, and homes were flooded near the bay. Losses reached $200,000 (1950 USD) in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Hurricane Baker spawned two tornadoes. On August 30, a F1 tornado touched down in Apalachicola, Florida, destroying four dwellings and a store building and damaging another eleven buildings. On August 31, a F0 tornado demolished one building near Marianna, Florida, in Jackson County. Inland, Birmingham International Airport recorded 50 mph (85 km/h) wind gusts; higher gusts were estimated near 75 mph (120 km/h) in elevated, mountainous locations. Hundreds of trees were prostrated as far north as the Birmingham, Alabama area, and one person was killed and two more injured by live wires falling from utility poles.

Walter Grundmann

Walter Grundmann (21 October 1906, Chemnitz - 30 August 1976, Eisenach) was a German Protestant theologian during the Third Reich and GDR. He was a member of the Nazi party from 1930 onwards, and from 1933 onwards an active member of the German Christians. He was made head of the newly founded Instituts zur Erforschung jüdischen Einflusses auf das deutsche kirchliche Leben in Jena, which was meant to serve state anti-semitism by the "Entjudung" (dejudifying) of the Bible and giving anti-Semitic theological training. Despite his past Nazi activities, Grundmann regained some prestige as a theologian in East Germany; in 1959 he published his comments on the Gospels, which by the 1980s had become standard popular literature.

Thomas Henry Parry

Thomas Henry Parry DSO, DL (1881 – 8 October 1939) was a Welsh Liberal politician, lawyer and soldier.
Date of birth.
One usually reliable source shows Parry’s date of birth as 21 April 1878, however The Times newspaper in its obituary of Parry reported he was aged 58 at death making his date of birth 1881. This is also the date given in the publication "Who was Who". This date seems the more likely as it was reported at the time Parry was adopted as the Liberal candidate for the Flint Burghs, by-election in 1913 that he was aged 32 years. His age at death was also given as 58 years in the "Law Journal".
Birth and education.
Parry was born in Mold in Flintshire the son of Thomas Parry JP. He was educated at University College, Aberystwyth and Christ's College, Cambridge where he received his MA and LL.B degrees with honours.
Law and the Army.
Parry was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple and practised as a member of Chester and North Wales Circuit. At the outbreak of the First World War, Parry enlisted and was a subaltern in the 5th Royal Welch Fusiliers, Territorials. He served in the European theatre, Gallipoli, Egypt and Palestine between 1914 and 1919. He was wounded at Suvla Bay and hospitalised in Cairo. By the time of his injury at Suvla, where he also contracted frostbite, Parry had risen to the rank of Captain. He was also wounded three times in action in Gaza in which conflict he won the Distinguished Service Order in 1917. For his bravery in other actions Parry was mentioned in despatches and won the Order of the Nile.
After the war, Parry continued to be associated with the Royal Welch Fusiliers. By November 1918 he had achieved the rank of Major, by May 1919 he had risen to the rank of Colonel and by August 1919 he was Lieutenant-Colonel. He ended up Lieutenant-Colonel Commanding the 5/6 Royal Welch Fusiliers and was Military Member of the Flintshire Territorial Force Association.
Politics.
Parry entered Parliament at a by-election in January 1913 following the death of the sitting Liberal member for Flint Burghs, James Woolley Summers. The constituency included Parry’s home town of Mold where he was a prominent lawyer and he was elected with a majority of 211 votes over the Unionist, J H Roberts – as usual in these contests a reduced majority from the previous election when Summers had a majority of 509. The constituency disappeared in boundary changes in 1918 so Parry transferred to the county seat of Flintshire. Parry received the coalition government coupon at the 1918 general election and was returned unopposed At the 1922 general election Parry faced Labour and Unionist opponents but held the seat. Labour did not contest the seat at the 1923 election but again Parry held off a challenge from the Tories. He was unable to campaign in Flintshire at the 1924 general election through illness brought on as a result of his war wounds and the seat passed into Conservative hands.
In 1922, Parry had been appointed as Deputy Lieutenant of Flintshire. One of his other duties was as a member of the Regional Pension Advisory Committee for Wales.
Death.
Parry died at his home in Mold on 8 October 1939 having been ill with pneumonia.

Mario Marinică

Mario Marinică (born 13 December 1964) is a football manager and coach, currently Technical Director at Sportul Studenţesc.
He holds the UEFA Pro Licence, the highest football coaching qualification. He has coached at Romanian clubs FC Gloria Buzău, Sportul Studenţesc, Argeş Piteşti, Rocar Bucureşti, and Cimentul Fieni. He has also coached at Black Leopards in South Africa. In England, he has worked at Crystal Palace FC and Arsenal FC's Academies as well as Leyton Orient FC's School of Excellence. His playing career included spells at Rocar Bucureşti, Dinamo Bucureşti and Steaua Bucureşti.
Playing career.
Mario Marinică featured most notably in the youth and reserve teams at Rocar Bucureşti, Dinamo Bucureşti and Steaua Bucureşti, eventually retiring from playing in 1993.
Coaching career.
His coaching career commenced in 1993 at Leyton Orient FC. In a varied coaching role, he directed "Football in the Community" courses, and developed players both at the School of Excellence and first team; working closely with Grant Cornwell, John Sitton and Chris Ramsey.
During the 1998-1999 season he coached Haringey Borough FC. He was both Head of Youth Development and First Team Coach as well as the club's Fitness Trainer. He would later return to the club as first team Manager for a brief spell at the end of the 2005-2006 season. Winning 6 out of the last 7 games, he saved the club from relegation together with his assistant Ged Searson.
From 1999 to 2001, Marinică was a coach at the Arsenal F.C. Academy, primarily in charge of the under-15 team. During this period, as part of an exchange programme he spent a short time assisting Massimo Pedrazzini within the technical department of Internazionale.
In the 2001-2002 season he returned to Rocar Bucureşti as Assistant Manager. Here he helped to develop a number of players including Cristian Neamtu, Cristian Silvasan, Ionut Rada, and Silviu Balace, that have since been capped by their country.
During 2002-2003, he became a development coach at the Crystal Palace FC Academy. He managed the U15 side, and coached from U14 to U19 levels. He worked with a number of players who have since turned professional and received International honours: Wayne Routledge, Gary Borrowdale, Ben Watson, Tom Soares, Sam Togwell, Lewis Grabban, Rhoys Wiggins, Andrew Julius, David Hunt, Gavin Heeroo, Teerathep Winothai, Will Antwi and Craig Dobson.
At the start of 2003, he was appointed First Team Coach at Argeş Piteşti, working with players such as Nicolae Dică, Andrei Prepeliţă, Raul Marincău, Marius Bilaşco, and Adrian Iordache.
His progress at Argeş Piteşti brought him to the attention of Romanian Serie B club, Cimentul Fieni. He was appointed Caretaker Manager of the Club, towards the end of 2003. In a limited time, and with scarce playing and financial resources, he managed to save Fieni from relegation and help restore pride to the team.
In recent years he has been a member of the Technical Support Staff of the Romanian Football Federation. His coaching and Coach-Educator expertise have been used to help develop their UEFA-A and UEFA-B licence coaching courses. He has also consulted on player development programmes for the U16 through U21 teams. He co-ordinated the 2006 visit to Romania of Howard Wilkinson. The former Technical Director of The Football Association was brought over by Marinica to conduct a session of the Romanian Football Federation's UEFA Pro Licence course.
"I have known Mario for a long time. He is an intellectual coach; methodical, a statistician, and an excellent personality."
Mircea Rădulescu, Technical Director of the Romanian Football Federation.
He has been employed by Hertha Berlin, Watford FC, Stockport County FC and Notts County FC for scouting and technical analysis of forthcoming adversaries. He has also been employed to assist Romanian clubs Steaua Bucureşti and Dinamo Bucharest in preparation to face English opposition in European competition. His unsurpassed tactical analysis provided the basis for Steaua Bucureşti's defeat of Middlesbrough FC and Dinamo Bucharest's 5-1 defeat of Everton F.C. in the UEFA Cup. It was the first time Everton F.C. had conceded five goals in European competition.
During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he assisted the Paraguay national football team, providing technical analysis of their group B rivals: England, Sweden and Trinidad & Tobago.
From 2005 to 2007, he completed the UEFA Pro Licence with the Irish Football Association, graduating alongside him were Chris Coleman, Jim Gannon and Bernard McNally; amongst others.
In the 2008-9 season, he was the interim manager of Romanian Liga I (Premier Division) side FC Gloria Buzău. He had been initially employed as Technical Director, and developed young players such as Eric Bicfalvi, Alexandru Tudose, and Alin Litu, all of whom are current members of the Romania national under-21 football team. He took over the Head Coach role in late 2008, and helped turn around a club that had made the worst ever start to a season in the Romanian League. He secured a notable draw, away to traditional powerhouse Steaua Bucureşti.
In June 2009, he was appointed Manager of South Africa National First Division side Black Leopards. Fans heralded Marinica as 'the messiah' upon his appointment, but after just over a month in the hotseat he had to return to Bucharest due to family problems. Former South Africa national team and current Mamelodi Sundowns coach Ted Dumitru commented at the time; "Mario is a very tactical coach and I’m convinced that he would have turned the team around. He has very strong scientific aspects of hard performance in football."
Since July 2010 he has been employed as Technical Director at Romanian Premier League side Sportul Studenţesc, following speculation linking him with the Zambia national football team job.

<doc id="19918756" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19918756" title="Siuru">
Siuru

The Siuru literary movement, named after a fire-bird in Finno-Ugrian mythology, was founded in 1917 in Estonia. It was an expressionistic and neo-romantic movement that ran counter to the Young Estonia formalist tradition. 
Members.
Along with the founder August Gailit, the movement included the following young poets and writers: Marie Under, Henrik Visnapuu, Johannes Semper, Friedebert Tuglas and Artur Adson. 
Between 1917 and 1919, Siuru published three volumes of poetry. 1919 led to conflicts within the group. Visnapuu and Gailit left, while Johannes Barbarus and August Alle joined as new members.
Program.
The members of Siuru had an affinity with futurism and Impressionism. Their poetry was often seen as scandalous due to their erotic nature. Siuru's philosophy stressed the freedom of the human spirit. Mottos of the group included "Carpe diem!", and "May the joy of creation be our only moving force", the latter suggested by Friedebert Tuglas. The group's symbol was white chrysanthemum.
Significance.
A major result of Siuru's activities was popularisation of literature among Estonian people, leading to the active development of original Estonian literature in the young Republic of Estonia. While the movement itself was short-lived, cut short by Estonian independence and the ensuing movement of national literature, its members rose to be major figures in Estonian literature through Estonia's first period of independence and in the exile Estonian literary community during Soviet occupation.
Marie Under (1883–1980) was the leader of the movement, publishing her first book, "Sonnets", in 1917. While her expressions of nature found a wide audience, her frank eroticism shocked conservatives, a motif she carried on in her subsequent works. Under went on to a long and distinguished literary career, publishing her last book in 1963.
Artur Adson (1889–1977) published his first collection of poems, "The Burning Soul," in 1917. Both this and his next collection, "Old Lantern" (1919), consisted of juvenile love poems. Adson went on to widely expand his genre, including dealing with social issues in a classical form. Adson wrote numerous plays. His "Four Kings," a drama on the Estonian uprising of 1343, is considered his most thrilling work. He continued to write in exile, also publishing several books of memoirs, the last in 1953. Adson was Marie Under's second husband.

Landscape photography

Landscape photography shows spaces within the world, sometimes vast and unending, but other times microscopic. Photographs typically capture the presence of nature but can also focus on man-made features or disturbances of landscapes.
Objectives.
Many landscape photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, unsullied depiction of nature devoid of human influence, instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light. As with most forms of art, the definition of a landscape photograph is broad, and may include urban settings, industrial areas, and nature photography. Notable landscape photographers include Ansel Adams, Galen Rowell and Edward Weston.
Environmentalism and landscape photography.
From its beginnings and continuing into the present era, some of the most important and celebrated landscape photographers have been motivated by an appreciation of the beauty of the natural environment and a desire to see it preserved. For example, Ansel Adams spoke passionately in defense of the natural world.

Abram S. Piatt

Abram (or Abraham) Sanders Piatt (May 2, 1821 – March 23, 1908) was a wealthy farmer, publisher, poet, politician, and soldier from southern Ohio who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He organized the only zouave regiment from Ohio and later led a brigade in the Army of the Potomac. In 1864, he and his brother constructed the Piatt Castles, two sprawling chateaux near West Liberty, Ohio, that are still used today for weddings, meetings, retreats, and other social gatherings.
Early life and career.
Piatt was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Benjamin McCullough Piatt and Elizabeth Barnett. His father was a Federal Circuit Judge and entrepreneur engaged in land development and flat boat trade in Cincinnati, who moved his family to Logan County in 1828.
On November 10, 1840, Piatt married his Kentucky-born first cousin Hannah Anna Piatt at the home of his grandfather, Federal Hall, Boone County, Kentucky. They eventually would have eight children. He attended what is now Xavier University before deciding to return home to the Mac-a-cheek Valley in Logan County, where he became a prosperous farmer. In 1846, Piatt studied law briefly and began editing and publishing the local "Mac-a-cheek Press" newspaper.
His brother Donn Piatt became a staff officer in the Union Army during the Civil War, and after the war edited and published "The Capital," a weekly newspaper in Washington, D.C. that fiercely criticized the administration of President Grant.
Civil War.
Piatt's wife Anna died April 10, 1861, in Macochee, Ohio, as the American Civil War was beginning. A grief-stricken Abram became the colonel of the three-months' 13th Ohio Infantry Regiment on April 30, leaving his children in the care of a servant and his other family members. Later that summer, he raised a new three-years' regiment, the 34th Ohio Infantry, and clothed and fed them for a month and six days with his own gold. The regiment became known as Piatt's Zouaves for their early war red pants and zouave attire. Piatt also raised and equipped the 54th Ohio Infantry, which went into the field under the command of Thomas Kilby Smith.
On September 1, 1861, Piatt and the 34th moved to Camp Dennison near Cincinnati. The regiment then was ordered to western Virginia later in the month. It received its baptism of fire from a Virginia Confederate regiment at Chapmanville, Virginia, on September 25. During the fall and winter months, Piatt's Zouaves were on picket and scouting duty, and engaged in occasional skirmishing with guerrillas. In May 1862, the regiment had a sharp fight with the Confederates forces under Humphrey Marshall near Princeton.
In 1862, Piatt was promoted to brigadier general and assigned command of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, Headquarters, Mountain Department. Later serving in the Army of the Potomac, he saw action at the Second Battle of Bull Run that August. 
During the Maryland Campaign in the fall of 1862, Piatt and his regiment were detached from the Army of the Potomac and served in the Defenses of Washington, thereby missing the Battle of Antietam on September 17. He badly injured his back when his horse stumbled and brought both of them to the ground during the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 12, 1862. As a result of his injury, he resigned from the army on February 17, 1863.
Postbellum career.
Piatt returned to his home in Logan County and soon remarried and resumed farming. He and his brother both prospered and they built a pair of castles near West Liberty, Ohio.
He was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, 1865–66, and was the Washington correspondent of the "Cincinnati Commercial" from 1868-71. He established and edited, with George Alfred Townsend, the "Capital" at Washington, D.C., 1871–72, and was its editor-in-chief, 1873-80. He was arrested in 1876 by order of President Ulysses S.

He edited "Belford's Magazine" from 1888-89.

Whitworth Hall, County Durham

Whitworth Hall which stands in Whitworth Hall Country Park, near Spennymoor, County Durham England, is a country house, formerly the home of the Shafto family and now a hotel. It is a listed building.
Descendants of the Shafto family of Shafto Crag, Northumberland, served as Aldermen, Mayors and Sheriffs of Newcastle upon Tyne in the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1652 Mark Shafto, Recorder of Newcastle, purchased the manor of Whitworth. His son Robert, knighted in 1670 was Recorder from 1660 and his grandson was High Sheriff of Durham in 1709.
Two sons of Mark Shafto junior represented Durham City in Parliament: Robert Shafto 1712/3 and 1727/30 and John Shafto 1729-42. John was the father of Robert Shafto, better known as "Bobby Shaftoe", who vastly increased the family fortune by his marriage in 1774 to Anne Duncombe of Duncombe Park. Their son Robert Eden Duncombe Shafto, (also Member of Parliament for Durham City and later High Sheriff in 1842), who married Catherine Eden, daughter of Sir John Eden Bt of Windlestone Hall, replaced the old manor house with a new mansion in 1845. The house was substantially destroyed by fire and all that now remains of the 1845 rebuild is the detached library wing. The present two-storey seven-bayed house dates from the rebuild of about 1900.
Branches of the Shafto family had seats at Bavington Hall, Beamish Hall and Windlestone Hall.

Olympia București

Olympia Bucureşti was a football club based in Bucharest, in southern Romania. It was founded in 1904 and it soon became one of the best teams in the country, winning two Romanian Championships. The club was dissolved in 1946.
History.
The first football club from Bucharest, founded in October 1904 by young foreigners and a few Romanians from which we can mention: M. Gebauer, L. Breyer, Th. Davilla, the Grunberg brothers, prof. Ioanide, Szalay, Mendel. The clubs first president was Mario Gebauer, Lazăr Breyer was the secretary, and capitan of the team Gh. Viereck. The football pitch was the one from "Bolta rece" (near the Triumphal arch today).
The team participated at the "Herzog Cup" along with Colentina Bucureşti and United Ploieşti, a competition equivalent with the Romanian Championship, the predecessor of the Liga I. It succeeds to win the first two editions, in 1909-10 and 1910-11. Part of the team that participated at this performance: Gebauer - Hartman, Winter, L. Breyer, Davilla, Kemeny, Grunberg, Hart, Niculescu, Apostolescu, Bărbulescu (First 11). Beside them: Roman, Cominovici, Mincu, G. Vraca, C. Rădulescu, the Brebeţeanu brothers, the Volvoreanu brothers, Miti Niculescu, Şuţu, Drăghici, G. Dragomirescu, Ţane Săvulescu.
In 1915, the club fell apart, a part of the players go to rugby, and a part, in front with L. Breyer go to Colentina Bucureşti.
After World War I, the club bounces back and starting with 1921 participates at the Bucharest Regional Championship. During the pre-divisionary period, the team succeeds only once to pass the regional phase, in 1927-28, and qualifies for the national championship, but reaches only the "quarter-finals", being eliminated by Colţea Braşov (1-3). After the Romanian football passes to the divisionary system, the club plays for one season in Liga III in 1937-1938 and for one season in Liga II in 1940-1941.
After World War II, the club reappears in the Bucharest District Championship under the name of "Olympia-Rheim", after which is dissolved, leaving behind the fame of the neighbourhood, of the ACSA (Belu) football pitch, inaugurated in 1927 and of three generation of players: First one, 1925-1937 with M. Cruţescu, E. Kroner, Robe, Subăşeanu, Taciuc; Second one, 1938–1944, with Sucitulescu, V. Stănescu, Catană, Panait, Ion Vasile, Aştilean, Gică Nicolae, Gain, Fabian, C. Rădulescu-Jumate, C. Siomionescu; And the third one (the last) we see: Voinescu I, Voinescu II, Al. Ene, Călinoiu, Titi Popescu, Ciocea, the Medrea brothers, Gheorghiu, Andreescu, Jipa.

Williams v The Queen

Williams v The Queen was a decision handed down in the High Court of Australia on 26 August 1986. The applicant was indicted before the Supreme Court of Tasmania on twenty-nine counts - fifteen of burglary and fourteen of stealing. At the commencement of the trial counsel for the accused objected to the admission in evidence of a number of records of interview containing confessions allegedly made to the police by the applicant. After a voir dire the learned trial judge ruled that the records of interview which related to twenty-six of the counts should not be admitted in evidence. The matter was dismissed. 
There is an onus on a person under Section 34A(1) of the Justices Act 1959 Tasmania, to be brought before a justice as soon as practical once taken into custody for an offence. In the ordinary case of an arrest on suspicion, the arresting officer must have satisfied himself at the time of the arrest that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the guilt of the person arrested although the grounds of suspicion need not consist of admissible evidence. If the arresting officer believes the information in his possession to be true, if the information reasonably points to the guilt of the arrested person and if the arresting officer thus believes that the arrested person is so likely to be guilty of the offence for which he has been arrested that on general grounds of justice a charge is warranted, he has reasonable and probable cause for commencing a prosecution.

Active surface

An active surface is a surface of a radio telescope that is under active computer control of its shape. 
Large (more than 10 m in diameter or length) radio telescopes always bend during operation, due to their enormous weight and the fact that even the strongest materials are not perfectly stiff. This bending, typically in the range of a few millimetres, does not affect low frequency operation much, but dramatically reduces the efficiency of the telescope at higher frequencies where the wavelengths are comparable to the distortion. Typically, the efficiency of a telescope drops appreciably when the deviation from the desired shape is more than 1/10 of the considered wavelength. An active surface uses numerous small actuators to move the surface panels with respect to the underlying frame, and thus maintain the correct shape.
An active surface can try to compensate for many different types of errors. The first is gravity - this is simplest since previous measurements, or even a mathematical model, can be used to predict (and correct) any bending. More difficult is correction for wind and thermal errors, since these require measuring and correcting in real time.
The most notable examples of active surfaces are

Xiasha District

Xiasha District () is an industrial and educational center, located about 15 kilometers east of the city of Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. It is a sub district of Jianggan District (江干区).
Geography.
This area is included is part of the Yangtze River Delta region, which includes Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces.
History.
Xiasha is also called HEDA, which stands for the Hangzhou Economic and Technological Development Area. The area was founded in 1993 as one of China's first state level development zones. The zone currently occupied 34 square kilometers and may soon expand to a long range estimate of 100 kilometers. Xiasha strives to be an international industrial, scientific and manufacturing zone, paramount with a park of flags from all over the World which can be seen upon entering the Xiasha city center. Most of what is produced in Xiasha are microelectronics, mobile telecommunications, optical equipment products, automobile products, chemicals and computer laptops.
Several international companies are located in the Xiasha district including German owned Siemens High Voltage circuit breaker company, Motorola Mobile Communications Ltd., Toshiba, Mitsubishi, Allergan pharmaceuticals, Turumo Medical Corporation, Panasonic Motors, Dingyi, and food giant Wahaha. HEDA boasts 600 industrial enterprises in all.
Education.
Xiasha is also a district of colleges and universities. Xiasha has 14 universities, including the well-known Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Zhejiang Gongshang University and Hangzhou Dianzi University. These 14 Universities house and educate 200,000 students, and many of the small businesses in the zone cater to these students. Most all of these schools were formally in the city of Hangzhou, but moved to Xiasha starting around 2000. Moving Universities and Senior schools to outer districts is a new and popular concept now in China, as high real estate prices spur better economic development in the inner city. There are events for students and "English Corners", however many Expat teachers, and a few Chinese students complain about the relative isolation, the lack of entertainments, and the common view of the dull, flat landscape of the area, but since Xiasha is growing there is much to do if you have an imagination. The park near Zhejiang Sci-Tech is remarkable, with exquisite landscaping, arched bridges, sculpture, curved granite pathways. The streets have polished granite curbs, the sidewalks too are of polished and rough stone, with many park benches, trees, bike lanes. Canals with fishing areas are all over the city. The Qiantang river is nearby and often provides an ocean breeze as well as the largest "Tidal Bore" in the world. The river levee is completely paved and a car or bicycle can be ridden for miles on top of it.
Transport.
Most people who work in Xiasha district commute by public bus service, school and company busses, car or bicycle. However more high rise apartments are being built to fill the need of the workers there, and the urban area will rapidly get larger once the apartments are finished and the subway in operation.
There is excellent highway transportation leading to Xiasha from nearby cities, serviced by the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Hangzhou-Beilun highways. The nearest airport to Xiasha is the Xiaoshan International Airport, about 25 minutes by car. There are local taxi services that are numerous and easily noticeable on the roadways. The flagfall in a taxi is 6 RMB (.70 USD) versus 11 RMB (1.54 USD)in Hangzhou proper. However, a HEDA taxi is not allowed to take fares into the city of Hangzhou, whereas a Hangzhou taxi can come to Xiasha and return to Hangzhou with a paid fare. Several bus lines tie Xiasha District to the city center of Hangzhou. The B1 Bus goes from Xiasha to Huanglong Stadium in Hangzhou (usually the bus will stop running at 9:30 PM), and the K525 Bus goes to Hangzhou Railway Station. Currently the Hangzhou Metro subway has been in operation. The starting stop is Wenze Rd, which is near Zhejiang Science and Technology University. It takes about 45 min to Wulin Square, which is faster than B1 bus. However, the ticket price is higher than B1.

John Luke (artist)

John Luke (19 January 1906 – 4 February 1975) was an Irish artist. He was born in Belfast at 4 Lewis Street. The fifth of seven sons and one daughter of James Luke and his wife Sarah, originally from Ahoghill. He attended the Hillman Street National School and in 1920 went to work at the York Street Flax Spinning Company. He went on soon after to become a riveter at the Workman, Clark shipyard and whilst working there he enrolled in evening classes at the Belfast College of Art.
He excelled at the college under the tutelage of Seamus Stoupe and Newton Penpraze. His contemporaries included Romeo Toogood, Harry Cooke Knox, George MacCann, and Colin Middleton. In 1927 he won the coveted Dunville Scholarship which enabled him to attend the Slade School of Art in London, where he studied painting and sculpture under the celebrated Henry Tonks, who greatly influenced his development as a draughtsman.
Luke remained at the Slade School until 1930, in which year he won the Robert Ross Scholarship. On leaving the Slade he stayed in London, intent on establishing himself in the art world. For a time he shared a flat with fellow-Ulsterman F.E. McWilliam (1909–1992), and enrolled as a part-time student of Walter Bayes at the Westminster School of Art to study wood-engraving. He began to exhibit his work and in October 1930 showed two paintings, The "Entombment" and "Carnival", in an exhibition of contemporary art held at Leger Galleries. The latter composition, depicting a group of masked merry-makers, was singled out by the influential critic, P.G. Konody of the "Daily Mail" (3 October 1930), as 'one of the most attractive features of the exhibition'. But the economic climate was deteriorating and a year later, at the end of 1933, he was driven back to Belfast by the recession. He remained in Belfast, apart from a time during the Second World War when he went to Killylea, County Armagh.
Technique and Style.
John Luke's painting technique was painstakingly slow, his manner precise. 'I'm afraid I'm very much a one job man,' he once wrote to John Hewitt, continuing: 'my strength lies in making the most of one job at a time, in sustained thought and effort, to bring it to the highest level of organisation and completeness I desire: the other way I lead to disintegrate in looseness and frustration with its inevitable weakness.' The precision characteristic of his work was manifested, too, in his appearance and personal manner. Dark haired, in stature he was erect and spare of build. Always tidy, his clothes brushed, his hair short, he was, in Hewitt's words, 'not at all close to the romantic stereotype of the artist'.
Inspiration.
Apart from his work as a practising artist, he taught from time to time in the Belfast College of Art, where he influenced a generation of students 'especially in the matter of drawing', as he once put it. Although principally a painter, throughout his career he occasionally made sculptures, such as the "Stone Head", "Seraph" of c. 1940 (Ulster Museum)- indeed it was for sculpture that he won the Robert Ross Prize at the Slade School. He was also much interested in philosophical theories of art. In the 1930s, for example, as John Hewitt has recorded, topical books such as Roger Fry's "Vision and Design", Clive Bell's "Art" and R.H. Wilenski's "Modern Movement in Art" directed his thinking.
Exhibitions.
From the late 1930s until 1943, when he produced "Pax", there was a gap in his output, occasioned, no doubt, by his move to County Armagh in order to escape Belfast after the Blitz. In 1946 he held his first one-man exhibition at the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery, and this was followed two years later by a similar show, held under the aegis of CEMA, nearby at number 55A Donegal Place. In 1950, to celebrate the Festival of Britain the following year, he was commissioned to paint in the City Hall, Belfast, a mural representing the history of the city, a work which brought his name to the attention of a wider audience. In later years, other commissions followed for murals in the Masonic Hall, Rosemary Street, 1956, and the College of Technology at Millfield in the 1960s. He also carved in relief coats of arms for the two Governors of Northern Ireland, Lords Wakehurst, 1959, and Erskine of Rerrick, 1965. He was, too, a member of the Royal Ulster Academy.
Later life.
John Luke died in Belfast on 4 February 1975, just a month into his sixty-ninth year. A retrospective exhibition of his work was held, in association with the Arts Councils of Ireland, in the Ulster Museum in 1978, and was accompanied by a short monograph on his life and career written by John Hewitt. Since that time his reputation has grown enormously, his loss rekindling memories in many of his former students of a fastidiously arranged life-room in the College of Art, his coat folded to perfection and his soft, gentle manner of instruction.
--==About His Art==
As an artist John Luke presented an enigmatic view to the world. Reserved by nature and, perhaps, a little opinionated, he lived a very private life. His prowess as a draughtsman was evident in all he did and can be seen clearly, for example, in an early "Self-portrait" (Ulster Museum), done in pencil in about 1927. Here his sense of purpose is complete, his 'line' precise, taut and economical; qualities which can be seen, too, in another "Self-portrait" of the same time, but done in oils (Ulster Museum). This concern for line is evident also in "The Lustre Jug", 1934, where he has also taken delight in conveying the surface qualities of the various items in the composition. This picture was shown in the memorable "Ulster Unit" exhibition, held in Belfast in 1934, perhaps Luke's only foray into the avante-garde. His aesthetic otherwise embraced strictly traditional values, much of his inspiration, especially with regard to his interest in tempera painting, being drawn from the early masters of the Italian Renaissance such as Piero della Francesca and Botticelli.
In the mid and late 1930s Luke's preoccupation with formal structures began to assume a greater importance in his work. One of the first paintings in which this change is noticeable is "Connswater Bridge", 1934, in which large masses have been juxtaposed boldly one with another in a highly stylized manner, yet the clarity of the actual scene is retained. But two years later, in 1936, when he painted "The Bridge", his technique had matured to a degree which, perhaps, he never surpassed. Here his formalism, expressed in flowing and rhythmic lines and shapes, is carefully matched to the undulating landscape and the colours are bright, the mood optimistic. But this buoyancy was short-lived and by the following year, in "The Fox", currently being exhibited in the Ulster Museum, his mood had changed and a seriousness of purpose began to emerge which eventually overwhelmed him. The strict stylization seen in the latter composition became his hallmark for more than a decade, during which time he nevertheless produced some of his most memorable pictures, including "The Road to the West", 1944, and "The Old Callan Bridge", 1945. In "The Road to the West" he is still at the height of his powers, his treatment of the landscape being entirely original, a sense of discovery still evident, the whole in keeping with the mood of the times. The "Callan Bridge" picture presents him in an unusually light-hearted state of mind, although one still senses that the encroaching dark colours of the hedgerows betray a metaphorical colouring of mood.
Certainly by the late 1940s and early 1950s Luke had become obsessed with technique, and in pictures such as "The Three Dancers", 1945, "Northern Rhythm", 1946, "The Dancer and the Bubble", 1947, and "The Rehearsal", 1950, all of which are technically of the highest order, one begins to wonder about the paucity of content, for these are exercises in pure technique. the murals which he executed in the early Fifties in the City Hall and Rosemary Street Masonic Hall were to be virtually his last paintings and thereafter, apart from the uncompleted mural in the Millfield Technical College (building demolished 2002, remains of mural retained by demolition contractor) and the coats-of-arms carved for the Governors of Northern Ireland, he did little new work.
Luke, as we have seen, was a quiet, somewhat withdrawn figure. His severely Spartan lifestyle seems to have sapped his energy completely by the mid 1950s and possibly, too, he suffered a crisis of confidence as the post-war world took shape and the inexorable advance of Modern painting overwhelmed the traditional values which he espoused. Nowadays, with Modernism itself everywhere in retreat, the values represented by John Luke have again become appealing and reassuring to us.

Dalyup River

Dalyup River is a river located in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia.
The first European to discover the river was Surveyor General John Septimus Roe in 1848 who named it the Gore River after one of Captain James Cook's crew from the "Endeavour", Lieutenant John Gore.
The river was charted for the first time as the Dalyup River in 1875.
The name "Dalyup" is the Indigenous Australian word for the King Parrot.
The river rises west of Scaddan and flows south into Lake Gore.
The main tributary of the river is the West Dalyup River. Both rivers were formed 30 million years ago in the Oligocene Period resulting from the formation of the Ravensthorpe ramp. 
The river is an ephemeral system that mainly flows as a result of winter rains. It is the primary source of water for Lake Gore.
The catchment area of the river has only 10% of the natural vegetation remaining, the rest has been cleared for agricultural purposes such as winter cropping or livestock production.

Hydroxyethyl cellulose is a gelling and thickening agent derived from cellulose. It is widely used in cosmetics, cleaning solutions, and other household products.
Hydroxyethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose are frequently used with hydrophobic drugs in capsule formulations, to improve the drugs' dissolution in the gastrointestinal fluids. This process is known as "Hydrophilization".
Hydroxyethyl cellulose is the main ingredient in the lubricant KY Jelly. It is also a key ingredient in the formation of big bubbles as it possesses the ability to dissolve in water but also provide structural strength to the soap bubble.

Fearless (Taylor Swift song)

"Fearless" is a country pop song performed by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was co-written by Swift in collaboration with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman and Swift. "Fearless" was released on January 3, 2010 by Big Machine Records as the fifth and final single from Swift's second studio album, of the same name, "Fearless". Swift composed the song while traveling on tour to promote her eponymous debut album, "Taylor Swift" (2006). She wrote "Fearless" in regards to the fearlessness of falling in love and eventually titled her second studio album after the song. Musically, it contains qualities commonly found in pop rock music and, lyrically, is about a perfect first date.
"Fearless" generally pleased contemporary critics, many who complimented it for appealing to different age groups; others disagreed. In the United States, "Fearless" peaked at number 9 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), becoming the first single released after being certified gold by the RIAA. "Fearless" also entered charts in Canada and Spain. Swift performed the song in various venues, some of which were included on the Fearless Tour (2009–10). Footage from the Fearless Tour performances were used to comprise a music video for "Fearless", directed by Todd Cassetty. The video features both footage of the tour itself and backstage.
Background.
"Fearless" was written by Swift in collaboration with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act in order to promote her eponymous debut album, "Taylor Swift" (2006). While writing the song, she was not dating anyone or "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody." She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, "I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had." The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about "the fearlessness of falling in love", and "no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again." The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing "Fearless". After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated her personal definition of the word "fearless". To her, "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means that you have a lot of fears, but you jump anyway." That influenced her to title the album "Fearless". The song was first released as a promotional single from the album on October 14, 2008 as part of Countdown to "Fearless" an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; it was later released as the fifth and final single from "Fearless" on January 4, 2010.
Composition.
"Fearless" is a country pop song with a length of four minutes and one second. Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" described the song's genre as a "kind of orthodontically perfect pop rock". He said the most country part of the song was a lyric that referenced a "one horse town". The song is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is written in the key of F major and Swift's vocals span two octaves, from F3 to C5. It follows the chord progression F–C–Gm–B♭-C. Tom Ronald of Great American Country interpreted the song's message to be about "taking courage on the dating circuit." In a different perspective, Rob Sheffield of "Blender" magazine said the lyrics "And I don't know why but with you / I'd dance in a storm in my best dress, fearless" demonstrated how Swift enjoyed making a scene. He added that she would not wear "anything else to go ride around in a storm".
Critical reception.
"Fearless" was critically acclaimed by contemporary critics for its ability to relate to different age groups. Leah Greenblatt of "Entertainment Weekly" said Swift's vocals fit the song's melody and instrumentation, which, according to her, is "slick" and "radio-friendly". Heather Phares of Allmusic selected the track as one of best songs on "Fearless". Alice Fisher of the United Kingdom magazine "The Observer" congratulated "Fearless" for being one of Swift's "great songs with perceptive lyrics about universal truths that can be enjoyed at any age." Jim Harrington of "The San Jose Mercury News" believed "Fearless" contained appeal to different age groups: "Moms and daughters, as well as groups of teens and couples out for a date night, sing along with equal gusto."
Chart performance.
Upon its release as a promotional single, on the week ending November 1, 2008, "Fearless" debuted and peaked at number nine on the "Billboard" Hot 100 with sales of 162,000 digital downloads, becoming Swift's third consecutive top ten song on the chart. In the succeeding week, the song fell to number 38 and after four weeks of roaming the "Billboard" Hot 100 it fell off the charts. Following its single release, the song re-entered the "Billboard" Hot 100 at number 94 on the week ending March 13, 2010. Its highest position on the chart while being released as a single was number 76 on the week ending April 10, 2010. The song is one of 13 songs from "Fearless" charted within the top 40 of the "Billboard" Hot 100, breaking the record for the most top 40 entries from a single album. "Fearless" spent a total of 15 weeks ascending and descending the "Billboard" Hot 100. "Fearless" also peaked at number ten on the Hot Country Songs, making this her tenth consecutive top ten hit but also her lowest-charting single, and number 18 on the now-defunct Pop 100. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for the purchase of over 500,000 digital downloads. It therefore became the first single released after being certified gold by the RIAA, as a result of digital downloads. As of October 2012, "Fearless" has sold over 1,000,000 copies in the United States, and has since been certified platinum by the RIAA.
On the week ending November 29, 2008, "Fearless" debuted and peaked at number sixty-nine in Canada, spending a total of five weeks on the chart. The song peaked at number thirty-two in Spain.
Live performances.
Swift's first televised performance of "Fearless" was on November 10, 2008 on the "Late Show with David Letterman". She went on to perform the song on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" and Clear Channel Communications's Stripped. Swift performed the song on all venues of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which extended from April 2009 to July 2010. During each performance, Swift escorted a silver sparkly dress and black boots and played an acoustic guitar as floral patterns with a moving butterfly were projected on the stage. Alice Fisher of "The Observer" attended the May 7, 2009 concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London, England and said that while herself drifted off during the performance, it "clearly made perfect sense to the girls in the audience." Jocelyn Vena of MTV News reported that the audience loudly sang along to the performance of "Fearless" at the August 27, 2009 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The song is also performed on the Speak Now World Tour.
Various tour performances were used to comprise a music video for "Fearless", directed by Todd Cassetty. The video premiered on February 17, 2010 on CMT. It begins when Swift tells her band before they step onstage, "You guys, this tour has been the best experience of my entire life." The video intermingles footage from the tour itself with fans excitedly showing off signs to Swift with behind-the-scenes footage of Swift and her band as they travel on the Fearless Tour. It ends with the singer waving goodbye as she exits the stage. Upon watching the video, Vena interpreted it to be "Swift's love letter to her fans", as it showed an "inside view of what it's like to go on tour".

Consequently the PP parliamentary party removed Calomarde from all positions held in the parliament. Days later, Calomarde published another article in El País, criticising the leadership's positions on terrorism and accusing them of using the issue for purely electoral ends. On 14 April 2007 Calomarde published an open letter to the PP leadership announcing his resignation from the party.

The corolla is regular, from in diameter with five pink, deeply notched petals. There are several stamens, some of which may be vestigial, and five styles. The fruit is a five-chambered capsule. This plant flowers between June and August. 
Distribution and habitat.
Alpine catchfly is found in northern Europe including Norway, Sweden, Finland and Lapland and in the Alps and the Pyrenees where it grows on rocks including extra-alkaline serpentine rocks, gravel banks beside rivers, sand banks, sea cliffs and nutrient-poor, stony areas. In Greenland and North America it is found on tundra, barren rocky areas, gulleys and riverside shingle, grassy slopes and sea cliffs. In general it thrives where other plants that are less tolerant of high concentrations of copper and heavy metals in the soil do not.
Uses.
Because of its ability to grow in soils with heavy amounts of copper, "Silene suecica" is used as a copper content indicator in geobotanical prospecting.

He was also a developer of innovative digital cataloguing systems and the creator of the PRECIS indexing language in 1974, which was used worldwide and for the British National Bibliography. "His aim was to create an indexing system that would liberate indexers from the constraints of 'relative significance' (main entries). ...As by-products of his indexing theories he worked out drafts that in the mid-1980s were accepted as British and International Standards for examining documents, and for establishing multilingual and monolingual thesauri". PRECIS was an example of the application of syntactical devises in indexing.

Syd Brak

Syd Brak is an illustrator.
Early career.
In the mid 1970s, Syd was awarded the 'gold award' for design and illustration in Johannesburg South Africa by Bill Bernbach. In the late 1970s, Syd moved to London. He started working as a freelance airbrush artist. He has done work for companies including CocaCola [http://www.sydbrak.co.uk/page4/files/page4-1014-full.html], MSN, and Levi's.
Long distance kiss.
In 1982, his poster, ["Long Distance Kiss"] [http://www.sydbrak.co.uk/retro/posters/long-distance-kiss-airbrush.html] was the top selling poster in the world. It was sold in Athena postershops.
Technique.
Syd Brak was one of the most influential artists of the 1980s, perfecting an airbrush technique that allowed him to create some of the most iconic images of that decade. 
The kiss series.
The "Kiss series" that so inspired designer Martin Kidman was another big hit for Athena. Created by Syd Brak, an artist from an advertising background, it was planned specifically to appeal to teen and pre-teen girls who, Brak says, "aspire to maturity and sophistication". Pictures such as "First Kiss", "Forget Me Not" and "Long Distance Kiss" all contained some mini- narrative that chimed with the adolescent psyche, hinting picturesquely at the dramas of teenage melancholy, lost love and heartache. The icy, mysterious girls, their faces bleached out, their eyes smothered in electric blue eye shadow and their lips a streak of glossy red, inspired many imitations with cheap make-up. They also apparently inspired last year's homage to the 1980s in "The Face" which featured on its cover a photograph of airbrush-style perfection. The same photographer, Sølve Sundsbø, followed it up with his recent ad campaign for hip design house Bottega Veneta - the collection, needless to say, inspired by 1980s style. 
Recent career.
His retro style posters capturing the new romantic / punk era of the late 70s early 80s. They have been sold by the hundreds of thousands.
Syd has also done book covers for authors including John Grisham, Wilbur Smith and Ken Follett.

Jenny Lake Boat Concession Facilities

The Jenny Lake Boat Concession Facilities, also known as Reimer's Cabin and the Wort Boathouse, are a group of buildings on Jenny Lake in Grand Teton National Park. They include a dock, a boathouse, two employee cabins and Reimer's Cabin. The boathouse was built by concessioner Charles Wort, who held the original U.S. Forest Service use permit from the time before the establishment of Grand Teton National Park, when the lands and lake were under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service. Robert Reimer took over the concession by 1935 and built a personal residence in 1937. The log cabin is an example of the National Park Service Rustic style.
The Jenny Lake developed area includes the Jenny Lake Ranger Station Historic District and Jenny Lake CCC Camp NP-4. Reimer's Cabin was built in 1937 for Robet "Dick" Reimer, who took over the boat concession in 1935. Plans for the cabin were approved by the National Park Service landscape Division, which also supervised construction. 
The Jenny Lake boat concession facilities were placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 24, 1998.

Double the Numbers

On October 17, 2007, the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education launched "Double the Numbers: Kentucky's Plan to Increase College Graduates". The plan states that to raise Kentucky’s standard of living to the national average by 2020, Kentucky must double the number of its citizens with at least a bachelor's degree, and outlines five key strategies to reach this goal. 
The state's Double the Numbers effort is supported by KnowHow2GOKy a comprehensive outreach campaign.
Why Bachelor's degrees?
Demographers predict that in 2020, about 1 of every three Americans will have a bachelor’s degree. In 2000, about 1 in 5 Kentuckians had a bachelor’s degree. If current trends continue, Kentucky will fall short of its goal by about 211,000 college graduates. Simply put, this plan is one of the most substantial contributions our postsecondary education programs can make to Kentucky’s quality of life in the shortest period of time.
The plan focuses on bachelor’s degree production because: 
Benefits.
There is a strong correlation between education level and personal income, productivity, civic participation, life expectancy, employment status and community strength.
States with more college graduates have stronger, more diverse economies. 
College graduates are healthier. 
States with more college graduates generally enjoy a higher quality of life. 
high school diploma. 
The Five Strategies.
With help from the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems and Kentucky’s nine public postsecondary institutions, the Double the Numbers Plan outlines five strategies which, if implemented concurrently over the next 13 years, will produce the additional degree holders needed to Double the Numbers.
Strategy 1: Raise high school graduation rates. 
Strategy 2: Increase the number of GED graduates and transition more to college. 
Strategy 3: Enroll more first-time students in community/technical colleges and transfer them to 4-year programs. 
Strategy 4: Increase the number of Kentuckians going to and completing college. 
Strategy 5: Attract college-educated workers to the state and create new jobs for them.
Regional approach.
To give the statewide targets more meaning, the Double the Numbers Plan sets 2020 targets for each of eight university service regions in each of the five strategies. The plan also identifies the potential benefit to the region in terms of increased average household income and encourages each region to pursue a coordinated effort engaging all postsecondary institutions and education and business partners in its region.

The Athenian Society

The Athenian Society was an organization founded by John Dunton in 1691 to facilitate the writing and publication of his weekly periodical "The Athenian Mercury". Though represented as a large panel of experts, the society reached its peak at four members: Dunton, Dr. John Norris, Richard Sault and Dunton's brother-in-law, Rev. Samuel Wesley. The group would answer the questions of readers about any topic, creating the first advice column. In 1693, for four weeks, "The Athenian Society" published also "The Ladies' Mercury", the first periodical published that was specifically designed just for women.
History.
In 1691, John Dunton founded The Athenian Society (not to be confused with several other "Athenian Societies") in order to publish a journal. This group was originally composed of a small number of friends: John Dunton and mathematics teacher Richard Sault, then philosopher Dr. John Norris (though he declined to be part of the Society in writing and associated to profits), quickly joined by Dunton's brother-in-law the poet Rev. Samuel Wesley (according to Dunton, it would eventually grow to 12 members; there is no evidence of such additional members, though). Its name, and all its subsequent related "Athenian" names, derived from a biblical reference to St. Paul in Athens: "For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing." (Acts 17:21 KJV)
The Society was established in order to write and publish "The Athenian Gazette", become "The Athenian Mercury" with its second issue due to a legal threat, a journal sold one penny twice weekly, then four times a week. It professed to answer in print all questions received from anonymous readers on "divinity, history, philosophy, mathematics, love, poetry", and things in general; the answers (and sometimes the questions) were written anonymously by "a Member of the Athenian Society" (one of the four friends).
The new journal received a tremendous response and generated several imitations. On February 14, 1692, a young Jonathan Swift sent them a letter of appreciation along with an "Ode to the Athenian Society", his first published work. Concurrently to the periodical, issues of the journal were bound in calf leather and sold as "The Athenian Gazette", collecting a whole volume for 2.5 shilling (about one month after the last issue collected was released), a more permanent form with indexes preferred by learned customers and distinguished women; this is why the journal is often referenced to by its original "Athenian Gazette" name rather than the "Athenian Mercury" issues.
Demise of the Society.
In 1695, a glut of new titles led to the journal temporarily pausing in early 1696; in 1697, the death of Dunton's wife and the departure of Wesley after he received a promotion, led to a brief and aborted revival of the journal. It had run for 580 issues across nineteen volumes and a third: from March 17, 1691, to February 8, 1696 (19 full volumes of thirty issues, with a temporary closure between July and September 1692), then from May to June 14, 1697 (ten issues).
In 1703, Dunton sold the "Athenian Mercury" to publisher Andrew Bell, who collected selected and abridged parts in larger volumes called "The Athenian Oracle", 3 volumes in 1703–1704, with multiple reprints. Dunton would go on to project compiling three more volumes (without serialization), releasing only the 4th in 1710. All four volumes were reprinted in 1728.

John Kirby (topographer)

John Kirby (1690–1753) was an English land surveyor and topographer. His book "The Suffolk Traveller", first published in 1735, was the first single county road-book.
Kirby lived in Wickham Market, Suffolk and spent three years between 1732 and 1734 surveying the entire county. For part of this project he was accompanied by Nathaniel Bacon. In 1736 he published a large-scale map of Suffolk. Subscribers to this received a copy of his book as a free gift. A further large scale map was published the following year.
Life.
Kirby, born in 1690 at Halesworth, Suffolk, was originally a schoolmaster at Orford in that county, and afterwards occupied a mill at Wickham Market.
In 1735 he published at Ipswich, in duodecimo, "The Suffolk Traveller; or, a Journey through Suffolk," a road-book with antiquarian notices, from an actual survey which he made of the whole county in 1732, 1733, and 1734. Prefixed is a small map of the county. A new edition was published by subscription, with 'many alterations and large additions by several hands,' in 1764, 8vo, London, under the editorship of the Rev. Richard Canning, of which a reprint was issued from Woodbridge about 1800, containing some trifling additions, and a fourth edition, with additions, appeared as "A Topographical . . . Description of the County of Suffolk," 8vo, Woodbridge, 1829, with Ebden's map in place of Kirby's. A "Supplement to the Suffolk Traveller" was published in 1844 by Augustine Page (cf. his Introduction, p. vi). In 1736 Kirby issued "A Map of the County of Suffolk," illustrated with coats of arms and views. An improved edition, engraved by John Ryland, was published on a larger scale in 1766 by his sons John Joshua and William Kirby (entomologist).
Kirby died on 13 Dec. 1753, at Ipswich, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary at Tower, Ipswich. His portrait, by Thomas Gainsborough, R.A., was in 1868 in the possession of the Rev. Kirby Trimmer. He married in 1714 Alice Brown; his eldest son was John Joshua Kirby.

Beamish Hall

Beamish Hall is a mid-18th-century country house, now converted to a hotel, which stands in of grounds near the town of Stanley, County Durham. It is a Grade II* listed building.
History.
The history of Beamish Hall can be traced back to the Norman Conquest. The name of Beamish, is derived from a corruption of the Norman word 'Beauvis', meaning beautiful place, or the old French phrase 'bew-mys' which when translated means 'beautiful mansion'.
Originally built as a present in 1268 for the wedding of Isabella de la Leigh and Guiscard de Charron, the Manor went on to be occupied by five generations of Charrons and later Monbouchers. The last family member died in 1400. During the Middle Ages, the fortified manor was occupied by various local aristocrats, including members of the Percy family.
The manor of Beamish was forfeited to the Crown by Thomas Percy, Earl of Northumberland as a consequence of his part in the Rising of the North in 1569. A manor house (on the site of which the present house was later built), was built in the early 17th century probably by the Wray family. 
In 1683 the manor was purchased by Timothy Davison a wealthy Newcastle upon Tyne merchant. He was the Mayor of Newcastle in 1673 and a governor of the merchants company of Newcastle. His family consisted of eleven sons and five daughters. In 1714 his eldest surviving son, William, married Dulcibella (the daughter of John Morton, Rector of Sedgefield and Dulcibella Naylor). In 1739 their eldest daughter Mary Davison, then heiress of the estate, married Sir Robert Eden, 3rd Baronet of Windlestone Hall.
The Hall was built in the mid 18th century to replace the old manor. The original three storeyed seven bayed main front was soon extended by the addition of a further three bays.
In 1803 Catherine Eden, a daughter of Sir John Eden 4th Baronet, married Robert Eden Duncombe Shafto of Whitworth Hall, County Durham . In 1904 their grandson Rev Slingsby Duncombe Shafto inherited the estate and thereupon took Eden as an additional surname. He was High Sheriff of Durham in 1908. 
The Edens added a rear block to the house in 1813 and substantial further alterations and additions were made in 1897 and 1910 including an entrance porch with six Ionic order columns, ballrooms and a winter garden.
In 1949 following the death of Robert Shafto, the property was sold to the National Coal Board and the family moved to Bavington Hall. In 1969 the house was acquired by Durham County Council and from then until 1995 it was occupied by a Local Education Authority residential school. After being declared surplus to the council's needs, the Hall stood empty until August 2000. Later in that year it was again sold and was refurbished by new owners and converted into a hotel.
Beamish Museum now occupies part of the parkland in which the house stands. The hall is nearing the end of a renovation, which intends to restore the ancestral home to its original splendour. The grounds of the hall have also been themed, as 'Beamish Wild', to appeal to families; with aerial rope courses and a bird of prey conservation area, which includes vultures, eagles and owls amongst other species.

The Athenian Mercury

]
The Athenian Mercury, or The Athenian Gazette, or The Question Project, or The Casuistical Mercury, was a periodical written by "The Athenian Society" and published in London twice weekly between 17 March 1690 (i.e. 1691 Gregorian calendar) and 14 June 1697. John Dunton was the editor in chief. A spin-off of "The Athenian Mercury", "The Ladies' Mercury" was also published by "The Athenian Society", in 1693, for four weeks, that was the first periodical published specifically designed just for women.
Title.
The magazine was first called "The Athenian Gazette or The Casuistical Mercury" when it was first printed. Dunton explains in his autobiography "Life and Errors" he had an inspiration for the title one day while he was walking home that he would "not exchange for 50 guineas." He continues that a reader of his magazine need only consult Acts 17:21 to see the reasoning behind the title.
After the first issue was published, concerns were raised about Dunton's use of the word "Gazette", to which the 25-year-old "London Gazette" could be considered to have prior claim; in response, Dunton changed "Gazette" to "Mercury".
Advice column.
Scholars credit Dunton with initiating the advice column format. It was first used in "The Athenian Mercury" in 1691. He formed a "society of experts", which he called The Athenian Society, to give their knowledgeable advice on questions submitted by the magazine's readers. The magazine had an announcement at the end encouraging readers to send in their questions, "All Persons whatever may be resolved gratis in any Question that their own satisfaction or curiosity shall prompt 'em to, if they send their Questions by a Penny Post letter to Mr. Smith at his Coffee-house in Stocks Market in the Poultry, where orders are given for the reception of such Letters, and care shall be taken for their Resolution by the next Weekly Paper after their sending." The "most nice and curious questions" ran from natural sciences to religion to literature to politics. During the lifetime of the magazine "the experts" grappled with thousands of questions. The readers submitted questions like:
Dunton's "question-answer project", as he referred to his new format, needed people to help publish it. The first person that partnered with him was Richard Sault, a mathematics teacher. Sault understood the philosophy of Nicolas Malebranche and could convey it to Dunton. The first two issues of the magazine were composed and published by these two only. The "surprising and unthought of" magazine's style produced a response of hundreds of letters of inquiries. "The Athenian Gazette", as these first two issues were called, produced such a large readership that an increase in their Society membership of "experts" was required.
The next person to join the "secret" society of the Athenians was one Dr. Norris (likely the physician Edward Norris, the fifth son of Thomas Norris of Lancashire) who devoted his assistance without any compensation or recognition. As readership increased and the amount of inquiries became overwhelming, they added another member, Dunton's brother-in-law the poet Reverend Samuel Wesley. The Society consisted of these four real members and several fictional members.
Because Dunton's "answers to correspondents" were "universally received" his "Children of the Brain" were being plagiarized by a copycat publication called "The Lacedemonian Mercury." He fought this with advertising that said any queries that they had replied to should be resubmitted to his magazine for "amendments." Dunton referred to Tom Brown, chief editor of "The Lacedemonian Mercury", as "the chief Antagonist."
Some of the people who read the advice column in "The Athenian Mercury", and sometimes submitted questions and comments of their own, according to Dunton, were Sir William Temple (pertaining to Talismans, amongst other things), Jonathan Swift, Marquess of Halifax, Sir Thomas Pope Blount, Sir William Hedges, and Sir Peter Pett.
Related contemporary texts.
Periodicals.
Dunton was surprised one day early on into his "question project" with a letter that came from a "gentle-woman" who wish to know if ladies could submit inquires also. He assured them that their questions would be seriously considered, as on 23 May 1691 "The Athenian Mercury" printed the "gentle-woman's" questions. One thing lead to another and on 28 February 1693 "The Ladies' Mercury", a spin-off, started its own publication, a periodical exclusively for women.
Dunton followed in 1703 with a collection of the questions and answers from "The Athenian Mercury" called the "Athenian Oracle." The concept of questions submitted by readers of a periodical and free "expert advice" given was then followed by writer Daniel Defoe with his "Review" in 1704, followed by "The little Review." Then in 1708 came "The British Apollo."
Satire.
A comical representation of the Athenian Society written by Elkanah Settle, published in 1693 and titled "New Athenian Comedy," satirizes the mythical members of the Athenian Society and plays fun at the premises of the "Athenian Mercury."
Historiographical approach.
The "Athenian Mercury" is approached by most scholars in the context of Dunton's life. Additionally, analysis of the questions in the "Athenian Mercury" has been focused on the political and scientific content portrayed by the authors. Though this approach is useful, the "Athenian Mercury" can also be analysed in the context of gender representation due to the number of questions about courtship and gender relations. Helen Berry, in her book "Gender, Society and Print Culture in Late-Stuart England: The Cultural World of the Athenian Mercury", focuses more on the 30% of questions that are directly related to gender issues, a subject first broached by Kathryn Shevelow in "Women and Print Culture: The Construction of Femininity in the Early Periodical."

Mark Wiener

Mark Wiener (New York City, August 24, 1951 – September 29, 2012) was a New York City based abstract painter, editor and teacher.
Wiener studied painting and photography under Bauhaus influences at the Philadelphia College of Art. Influenced by Alexi Brodivitch, Frank Zachry and Alexander Lieberman, he early began working simultaneously in several visual media. Wiener worked for some years, in the United States and Europe, as a professional photographer, illustrator and web designer before turning to full-time painting. His commercial work from that period appeared in magazines including "The Wall Street Journal", "Esquire", "New York Magazine", "Paris Match", as well as in such books as "Family of Children" and "The Art of Mickey Mouse".
In 2006 he exhibited his gestural paintings at the Montblanc Manhattan flagship store, and participated in the Felissimo Design House “Tribute 21” program, work reproduced on ceramic plate and sold for the benefit of UNESCO. He received commissions from the World Federation of United Nations Associations to create first day covers and limited edition lithographs to accompany issues of UN Postage Stamps, and was awarded the Croix de Chevalier de’orde Belgo Hispanique under the patronage of Queen Fabiola of Belgium. He exhibited in Los Angeles, London, Paris, Milan and Tokyo, and regularly in New York City. His work appears in numerous private and corporate collections worldwide and in the permanent collection of the Housatonic Museum of Art.
Wiener published and was editor-in-chief of the online magazine Resolve40.com, which seeks to integrate artists in a New York art community, by frequent reviews of current exhibitions and activities at galleries and major museums, and by encouraging artists to participate in writing. This was one of the activities for which, Peter Frank characterizes Wiener—using Jane Jacobs’ term--as a "public character": one of those who, in the thick of a social fabric—here the New York City art scene--“find, or appoint, themselves its custodians.” 
After first devoting himself to photography, Wiener, based upon personal observations of the photographer Irving Penn’s process, began an approach to painting that he called “the white surface”. This combines the acting out of a “visual story” during the creation of the work, with Bauhaus ideas of underlying structure. In Wiener’s later works it appears as his organic gesture of throwing, dripping and pouring paint, orchestrated between drawing and painting layers of geometric objects, in increasingly large scales, with a variety of objects that he considered “brushes”. However, on a more intimate scale, he drew incessantly, whether in his many sketchbooks or on iPad, across all media—the digital no less than traditional charcoal, graphite and ink—responding to all experiences of life, but notably the process histories revealed in the textures of pavements and walls of his beloved City, demonstrating the seemingly inexhaustible form resources of gestural marks.
Wiener, in studio, was featured on the cover image for the "Wall Street Journal" article on Chelsea galleries in August, 2004. Opening of a memorial exhibition, “Street Markings” (October 3–25), curated from Mark Wiener's unfinished painting series and other related works, was delayed by storm-related electricity loss at Dorian Grey Gallery, 437 East 9th Street (near Avenue A), but, openined nevertheless on Wednesday, November 7, 2012.

Margaret Gardiner (artist)

Margaret Gardiner (22 April 1904 – 2 January 2005) was a radical modern British artist and resident of Hampstead, London, from 1932, where she was also a left wing political activist. She was also for a time the partner of Professor John Desmond Bernal, the eminent scientist and political activist. She was known as "Mrs Bernal" for most of her life, but they were never married.
Education.
She was educated at the Fröbel School in Hammersmith, then at Bedales, the liberally-minded school, followed by Newnham College, Cambridge. There she read Modern Languages, but transferred to Moral Sciences, the Cambridge term for Philosophy. Her family was wealthy and she had no need to work, devoting her life instead to politics and the arts.
Personal life.
She was born in Berlin where her father, the Egyptologist Sir Alan Gardiner, was working at the time. In 1923 he assisted Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon with the opening of Tutankhamun's tomb. Her mother was Hedwig, Lady Gardiner, whose father was an Hungarian Jew and mother a Swedish Finn. Her brother was Henry Rolf Gardiner.
At Cambridge she fell in love with Bernard Deacon, a scholar at Trinity but was shattered when he died from blackwater fever whilst working in the New Hebrides in 1927 at the age of 24. She visited his grave there 56 years later.
After Cambridge she spent a brief, but unsuccessful, time as an elementary school teacher in Gamlingay. Afterwards she devoted her time and energy to supporting her friends: Barbara Hepworth, Hepworth's second husband, Ben Nicholson, W. H. Auden, Berthold Lubetkin, Solly Zuckerman, Naum Gabo and others.
She made her home at 35 Downshire Hill, Hampstead, close to the Heath where she swam in the ponds into her 90's.
Her son with Bernal was Martin Bernal (1937-2013), author of "Black Athena", born 1937. Despite never marrying, Gardiner referred to herself as "Mrs Bernal". Bernal had married Agnes Eileen Sprague, a secretary, on 21 June 1922, the day after being awarded his BA degree when he was aged 21. As well as his son with Gardiner, he had two children with Sprague and one with Margot Heinemann.
Politics.
With Bernal, who was a Communist, she was part of the 1930s and 40s group campaigning "For Intellectual Liberty". Gardiner was however not pressed to join the party. She spent a winter with Bernal in Moscow but had reservations about Joseph Stalin. In the 1960s she organised full-page advertisements in "The Times" signed by well-known people opposed to the Vietnam War. She was also a supporter of CND.
In the 1970 general election Ben Whitaker, Labour MP for Hampstead, lost his seat as a result of a far-left candidate standing whom Gardiner had financed.

Casey (typeface)

Casey is a sans-serif typeface created and owned by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC), a transit operator in Hong Kong. The typeface was created in 1996 by Dalton Maag under the order of KCRC for use on the corporate identity of its railway system.
History.
Casey was introduced in 1996 by the KCRC. It was modified from Myriad (letters) and Formata Cond (numbers), and the name Casey comes from KC, the first 2 letters of KCRC. The Casey typeface looks thinner than Myriad and Segoe UI.
Dalton Maag later amended Casey and release it as a commercial font named "Stroudley".
Introduction.
Casey is created by KCRC for the use of its corporate identity on its railway system. Its first usage was on the KCRC logo, which was revised in 1996. When the Metro Cammell EMU of the KCR East Rail (now East Rail Line) was modernised, their fleet number was clearly posted in Casey. The same practice was done when the new SP1900 trains came into service.
When the KCR West Rail (now West Rail Line) started operation, its usage expanded to all signage and station nameboards in the WR stations, and even became the font used in the leaflets and brochures distributed by the Corporation. 
While some of the ex-KCR signages are changed to signs with MTR style (with Myriad as the font typeface) after the Rail Merger, some are retained until now (as of 2009).
Replicas.
As the typeface has never been distributed to the public, railfans in Hong Kong have created a replica font of Casey called Casey Replica. It is widely used by rail enthusiasts in Hong Kong in their KCR simulation works.

Ya'akov Meshorer

Professor Ya'akov Meshorer (August 14, 1935 – June 23, 2004) was the Chief Curator for Archaeology at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and a prominent Israeli numismatist.
Early life.
Known to colleagues and friends as 'Yankele', Meshorer was born in Jerusalem in 1935 into the prominent Mani family, who had lived in the area for centuries. He and his twin brother Asher used to find ancient coins as they played around the city, which was in the process of being built up. The 14 year-old twins donated the coins they had found to the Israel Department of Antiquities in 1949. He joined the Israel Defense Forces in 1954. After completing his army service in 1956 he became a member of Kibbutz Hazerim, where he married Adaya Weiss in 1956. Meshorer established a museum on the kibbutz before moving to Jerusalem in 1960, where he was a student at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1960 to 1966, receiving a BA in Archaeology and Jewish History and an MA in Classical Archaeology. He received his Ph.D in Numismatics in 1971 from the Hebrew University. Meshorer served as a reservist in the Jerusalem Reconnaissance Company and in 1967 was slightly wounded in the Six-Day War. He later served as an officer in the UN liaison unit.
Academic career.
Meshorer was appointed Professor of Numismatics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1983. He established the Numismatic Division at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 1969, remaining at its head until 1993. He also served as the University's Chief Curator for Archaeology from 1975 to 1982 and from 1990 to 1996. He retired from the Israel Museum in 2000.
Meshorer was a member of the Archaeological Council of the Israel Antiquities Authority and supervised the establishment of two museums devoted to Biblical Archaeology, the museum of the Cleveland Jewish Community Center in 1976, and The Hecht Museum at the University of Haifa in 1984. He was also a member of the Directorate of the Israel Society for Medals and Coins, serving on the committees that chose the design of the modern Israeli coins. He was instrumental in the decision to base the design of many of the modern coins on ancient Jewish coinage, in this way linking past and present in the State of Israel.
He published 19 books and more than 100 articles, almost all of them dealing with the coins of the Holy Land.
Honors and awards.
Meshorer was invited to lecture and research at several major institutions, including the American Numismatic Society in New York, Duke University, the British Museum, the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, and the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. Among the honors Meshorer received were the Huntington Medal of the American Numismatic Society in 2001, and in 2002 he was awarded the Irene Levi-sala Book Prize in Archaeology of Israel for his book ‘A Treasury of Jewish Coins From the Persian Period to Bar-Kochba’. He was elected an honorary member of the Council International Numismatic Commission at the opening of the 13th International Numismatic Congress of Madrid in 2003.
In 2002 a prize, the Ya'akov Meshorer Numismatic Prize, was established in memory of Meshorer at the Israel Museum; its first recipient was Dr. Andrew Burnett in 2002, and the second Dr. Michel Amandry in 2006.
Meshorer died in Jerusalem aged 69 after a six-year battle against cancer.
