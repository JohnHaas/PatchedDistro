List of iCarly characters

This is a list of characters from the Nickelodeon sitcom iCarly. The series is about a girl named Carly Shay who creates her own web show called "iCarly" with her best friends Sam and Freddie. The series stars Miranda Cosgrove as Carly, Jennette McCurdy as Sam, Nathan Kress as Freddie, Jerry Trainor as Spencer and Noah Munck as Gibby. The series was created by Dan Schneider, who also serves as executive producer.
Main characters.
Carly Shay.
Carlotta "Carly" Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) lives with her older brother, Spencer, in Seattle, Washington.
Carly's best friends are Sam Puckett, Freddie Benson and Gibby. Carly lives in the "Bushwell Plaza" in apartment 8-C with her funny, often careless, artist brother Spencer Shay.
In "iPilot", Carly takes the heat for one of Sam's pranks and has to oversee people who want to be in the school's talent show. When Carly, Sam, and Freddie's suggestions are completely ignored, they decide to make a web show named "iCarly" upon Freddie's suggestion, with the 'i' standing for 'internet' and Carly's name since she will be the host of the show.
Carly is a smart, pretty girl who gets good grades, going for straight A's in one episode. She is kind and naive at times, wanting to believe the best in people. She has her moments when she proves just how crazy she can be. Yet in many ways, she is more grown up than her adult brother.
She has occasionally wondered why she and Sam are friends as Sam tends to get her into trouble. Freddie has a crush on Carly, which everyone is aware of. However, she does not feel the same way (which she has told him many times). Despite this, in "iSaved Your Life", Carly wants Freddie to become more than friends because Freddie pushed her out of the way of a truck, getting hit himself instead. Although he was originally eager about their new relationship, Sam later advises him to break up with her. Freddie does so but regrets it later. In "iSpace Out" and "iSam's Mom", it is seen that Carly is claustrophobic. Carly was a vegetarian at one point.
She is the younger sister of Spencer Shay and the daughter of Colonel Steven Shay and Mrs. Shay. She lives with her older brother, Spencer, in Apartment 8-C at Bushwell Plaza in Seattle while their father is stationed on a Navy submarine; their mother has never been seen and was only spoken of once when it was stated that she was in the armed forces. She is the best friend of Sam Puckett and former best friend of Missy Robinson whom she hung out with during her childhood. She is also the best friend of Freddie Benson who lives across the hallway (Apt. 8-D) who has had a crush on her since the day they met. Carly is a kind, easygoing, and caring person who would do anything for her friends, although she can be spoiled at times when she doesn't get her way, especially in "iLook Alike", when Spencer would not approve her going to a mixed martial arts fight, which causes her to go into a tantrum state. In "iDate a Bad Boy", it is shown that she can be shallow, as she had a dislike of Griffin's hobby of collecting Pee Wee Babies (a parody of Beanie Babies).
Occasionally, she is forced to mediate between her best friends, Sam and Freddie. She usually tries not to get in trouble, except for when she takes the blame for Sam's wrongdoing. However, when pushed too far, like in "iHave My Principals", Carly has proven to be just as devious as Sam, which catches most people by surprise because of her generally nice demeanor and the little-known, but generally assumed, fact that she has never pulled a prank by herself until "iGet Pranky" (which she did with Spencer's help).
It was shown in iSpace Out and confirmed in iSam's Mom that Carly suffered from claustrophobia and freaks out when she is locked in a small space for a long period of time; in iPsycho, she appears distressed when Nora locks her, Sam, and Freddie in her booth down in her basement
Possibly her most prominent trait, Carly is not tough, and even when furious, she has never physically attacked anyone on-screen (but tried to tackle Freddie in an angry manner in "iThink They Kissed" and "iPromise Not To Tell"). However, on occasion, she will confront someone, even bullies and teachers, as shown in "iHave a Lovesick Teacher" and "iMake Sam Girlier". She was also part of a girl mob (Sam and Shelby Marx) that beat up Nevel in "iFight Shelby Marx" although Nevel said he wasn't scared of her.
Carly shows singing ability in "iDo", when she sings Shakespeare, and in "iPie", when she tries to get people at a funeral to sing "Amazing Grace".
In "iParty with Victorious", Carly portrayed a character called The "Hideous" Patty Schwab, Carly disguises herself to prevent recognition from fans so they can focus on finding Steven (Carly and Tori's boyfriend). Patty had a British accent. She said she was "Hideous" because of her look, along with Sam and Freddie, who also wore disguises. It is shown that she wears a mask to keep her from snoring. And in "iMeet the First Lady", her father's pet name for her is "Snug Bug." She has a liking for Bad Boys and Kissing boys. She moves to Florence, Italy in the series finale. Although her name is not stated, She is once mentioned in the show Sam & Cat when Sam states her best friend moved to Italy with her dad. She was never mentioned again until the episode when Mrs. Benson walked in on Freddie while he was talking to Cat over the phone in the hallway. She asked him if he was staring at Carly's apartment door again and reminded him that she was still in Italy with her dad and that she will never love him.
Sam Puckett.
Samantha "Sam" Puckett (Jennette McCurdy) is Carly Shay's best friend and in later episodes the ex-girlfriend of Freddie Benson. She co-hosts the show with Carly and handles the sound effect remote control. Sam has an identical twin sister named Melanie. Their mother is Pam Puckett (Jane Lynch). Sam also stated she and her twin sister Melanie were born on a bus due to poor planning by their mother. Pam has also driven off from a gas station and left her children there.
Even though she is a tomboy, prone to aggression, loves pranks, and hates working, she's really a nice girl at heart. It is mentioned in the series that she has been arrested three times. In "iWon't Cancel the Show", Sam gets arrested a fourth time after a man cuts in front of her in a market and she shoved a hot chili dog down his pants, only to find out he was the Mexican ambassador and as a result, she is sentenced to juvie for seven days (this is the only episode where Sam does not appear at all). Sam is also portrayed as gluttonous, with a particular love for meat (i.e. fried chicken, ham, bacon, steak, ribs and pork). One time she went on a meat patch she had at least 7 of them on her arm but still she couldn't resist her meatball. There is a running gag in the show where Sam is prone to say bacon. It was revealed in "iGot a Hot Room" that Sam's speaks fluent Italian and she said she can play a trombone (or at least took 3 years of lessons). She's got many stars on her locker, including Drake Bell, Patrick Stump, Pete Wentz, Joe Trohman and Andy Hurley from Fall Out Boy. Sam loves to dance, as shown in "iWas a Pageant Girl", when she did a dance with her former dance coach for the talent portion. Sam reveals that she has a small crush on Spencer and that was what was keeping her from beating him up after numerous pranks performed on her, Freddie, Carly, Gibby, T-Bo, and an old lady. She has a rabid three-legged cat named "Frothy". Sam has proven to have a musical background. In "iParty with Victorious", it is shown that Sam is a skilled rapper.
She occasionally refers to herself as "Momma." In the episode "iWant to Date Freddie" it is stated by Carly that Sam never lies but in the same episode she promised not to tell on Valerie even though she does. Also in "iSaw Him First", the nurse states that she will turn her in and asks her for her name and Sam says Rebecca Berkowitz. Despite her laziness and unhealthy diet, Sam is physically fit and several episodes show her flipping over full grown men or carrying Freddie over her shoulder with ease. She still lives with her mom although she often stays with Carly, as she is dissatisfied with her home life. In the episode "iParty with Victorious", Sam reveals that her father promised his family he would return, but still has not come back since. He is never actually seen or heard.
Sam admits she used to compete in beauty pageants (and came in second in 19 of them) but got suspended for seven years due to her being suspected of "pushing" a candidate, Leann Carter, down a flight of stairs. Sam pushes Carly into doing the pageant when she finds out that Leann is going for her 100th straight win. At the pageant, Sam finds out she can compete because it has been seven and a half years since the ban. For the talent part Sam dances with her old coach and comes out with first place.
During the first two seasons, Sam has a colorful, boy-like style, often dressing in cargo-capri pants and sweaters. As the series progressed, she begins to change her style. Most prominent in season 4, where on occasion she wears skinny legged jeans and heels. This shows she is aging and she is showing her girly side.
Sam tends to insult any other girl who has a crush on Freddie. Despite having dated boys before, she still shares her first kiss with Freddie. In "iSaved Your Life", she gets upset when she tells Spencer that Freddie got hit by a taco truck (even throwing down the pizza Spencer was holding when he thought she was tricking him so he would let his guard down and she could beat him in their game of "Assassin"), although she proceeds to help herself to a taco (bought from the same taco truck that hit Freddie) afterwards. In "iOMG", it is revealed that she is "in love" with Freddie, as she kisses him with passion. "iLost My Mind" would feature them finally together continuing "iOMG" when Carly saw Freddie and Sam kissing. In "iLost My Mind" Sam checks herself into a mental hospital because she thinks she is insane for being in love with Freddie. When Carly, Sam, and Freddie had to tape a show of "iCarly" in the hospital, Carly wanted to get the "iCarly" fans to see if Sam and Freddie should go out. After the iCarly fans are saying that Sam and Freddie should go out, Freddie then records himself saying that no one has asked how he feels. Sam, of course, thinks this is his chance to get back at her and embarrass her. In the middle of yelling at him, Freddie walks over to her and kisses her.
Then in "iDate Sam and Freddie", they kept arguing, while Carly helped them get along, and eventually they would make-up and kiss afterwards. When Sam and Freddie go on their date, they get in an argument again. Carly tries to settle it but she gets frustrated, and tells them maybe they aren't meant to be, leaving the episode a cliff-hanger. In "iCan't Take it", Gibby and Freddie's mom try to break Sam and Freddie up. They didn't break up but they did get in an argument which caused Freddie to think that he should break up with her. But Carly convinces Freddie that Sam would never try to hurt him. Or ruin his chances of getting in NERD camp. Even though before Sam did sabotage his application to be in NERD camp. Freddie and Sam make-up and kiss. In "iLove You", Sam and Freddie try each other's hobbies. Freddie invites Sam to hang out with him at his club "Training Bros". Sam makes Freddie get kicked out by accident. So Sam invites Freddie to see her Uncle Carmine and cousin Chaz in prison. Freddie gets caught with ham in his pants, which causes Carmine and Chaz to get sent away by the police. Sam warns Freddie that they might stab him later on. After that, Sam and Freddie overhear Carly talking to Spencer and Jenna about their relationship. Freddie and Sam feel as if Carly was talking about their relationship. So Sam and Freddie finally come to closure on the past episodes "iKiss", "iOMG" and "iLost my Mind". And they decide that maybe later on if they ever become mature about a relationship, they'll get back together. So they decide to break-up. When Sam gets off the elevator, Freddie tells her that he loves her for the first time. Sam tells him she loves him too, and they kiss. When Freddie sees what time it is, 10:30, Sam suggests they break-up at midnight so they can have an excuse to kiss for the last time.
In the last episode of iCarly, "iGoodbye", Carly leaves to live in Italy with her dad and she and Sam take a break from their web show. She left school, and with her new motorcycle she left Seattle to go and travel the country. In L.A she met Cat Valentine. After Cat's Nona goes to live in a senior home, Sam & Cat became roommates in her apartment and launch a babysitting service. She also begins to take online courses for high school credit. Sam and Cat's home is stated as 'the poshest apartment in the building'.
Freddie Benson.
Fredward "Freddie" Benson (Nathan Kress) is the technical producer for the web-show "iCarly" which stars his friends Carly Shay and Sam Puckett. He is often the scapegoat when it comes to Sam's bad ideas. It is revealed that he has had a crush on Carly since the 6th grade, but Carly generally only regards him as her best friend. However, in "iSaved Your Life", Carly falls for him after he saves her from getting run over by a taco truck, revealing that there is more to her feelings for him. Freddie (acting on advice from Sam) breaks up with her and says that if Carly still loves him and would still want to be his girlfriend when "the whole hero thing dies down", he would "be very psyched about it." At the end of this episode, Freddie is shown in the elevator asking himself, "What did I do?" He clearly still had feelings for Carly, as did she for him, but he did not want to use her, and so he broke it off with her, for the time being.
Like Carly, Freddie is shown to get high grades in school, although his talents are on a more technological basis; thus, he is somewhat of a nerd. When explaining a certain technology that Carly and Sam do not know about, he tends to speak in terms that neither Carly nor Sam can comprehend, and thus, this is one of the sources of Sam's constant ridicule of Freddie. He is shown as being a very effective producer, though he is given little credit for "iCarly"'s popularity. Sam eventually somewhat realizes his vital role to the webcast when a girl named Valerie makes him "her" technical producer instead, and "iCarly" is greatly hindered as a result. It is also known that Freddie is interested in studying multiple foreign languages, including French, Spanish, and Portuguese. From the second season on, he is frequently heard exclaiming phrases in Spanish. In one episode, it is mentioned that Freddie has a living grandfather.
Freddie's relationship with his mom is a very strained one. She means well, but can be overprotective. At the end of the day, though, they love each other. In "iGo to Japan", it is revealed that he has a GPS chip in his head she implanted him in Venezuela due to his mother being overprotective of him, which was used to find them after they were ditched by two Japanese people near Tokyo. Her constant overbearing eventually drove Freddie to temporarily move out of their apartment, and he remained there until his mother begged him to come back. Freddie agreed as long as she unblocked his favorite channels and left him alone in public. His father is not mentioned, much like Carly's mother.
Freddie's relationship with Sam in the first season shows a strong dislike for each other. They have become more civil to one another as the series progresses to the point of them only arguing when they are around other people. Freddie constantly finds himself on the wrong end of Sam's demeanor and his near-psychotic mother's over-protectiveness. Throughout the series, Sam insults him, causes physical harm to him, or pulls pranks on him without hesitation, and also insults any girl who is attracted to him. But they both care for each other. Freddie gradually gets used to this so much so that in "iKiss", he stated that "his life would feel too weird if she didn't make him miserable all the time" and kisses Sam after they mutually compromise to "get their first kiss over with". In "iReunite With Missy", Sam asks for Freddie's help and when Carly finds out she says to Freddie, "You care about Sam" which shows that despite her constant abuse, he sees her as a good friend. In "iOMG", he tests out his new app that tells you your mood, on Sam, and it said in love. He assumes it is their new intern, Brad and tells Carly. But at the end of the episode Sam kisses Freddie, revealing she was in love with him. When the kiss is over Sam says, "Sorry." Freddie then says, "It's cool," with mixed emotions of confusion and gladness on his face. The episode ends there leaving Freddie unsure of his feelings for Sam. "iLost My Mind" features them finally together continuing "iOMG" when Carly sees Freddie and Sam kissing. Freddie kisses her live on iCarly at the end of the episode showing that he does, in fact, reciprocate Sam's feelings. Then in "iDate Sam and Freddie", they kept arguing, while having Carly help them get along. They eventually made up afterwards.In "iCan't Take It", Gibby and Freddie's mom try to break Sam and Freddie up by revealing to Freddie that Sam sabotaged his application for NERD (New Electronics Research and Developement) Camp, thus ruining his chances of getting in. They didn't break up but Freddie was devastated, leading him to seriously consider a break up. Luckily, Carly (feeling guilty about helping Mrs. Benson and Gibby and not wishing for her best friends to be unhappy) convinces Freddie that Sam would never try to hurt him and that she loves him. Freddie changes his mind and the two make up.
In "iLove You", Sam and Freddie try each other's hobbies. Freddie invites Sam to hang out with him at his club "Training Bros". Sam makes Freddie get kicked out by accident. So Sam invites Freddie to see her Uncle Carmine and cousin Chaz in prison. Freddie gets caught with ham in his pants, which causes Carmine and Chaz to get sent away by the police. Sam warns Freddie that they might stab him later on. After that, Sam and Freddie overhear Carly talking to Spencer and Jenna about their relationship. Freddie and Sam feel as if what Carly said also applied to their relationship. So Sam and Freddie finally come to closure on the past episodes "iKiss, iOMG" and "iLost my Mind". And they decide that maybe later on, if Freddie becomes more weird or Sam becomes more normal, they'll get back together. So they mutually decide to break-up. When Sam gets off the elevator, Freddie tells her that he loves her for the first time. And Sam tells him she loves him too, and they kiss. When Freddie sees what time it is, 10:30, Sam suggests they break-up at midnight so they can have an excuse to kiss for the last time.
In "iGoodbye", Freddie first assumes that Sam wants to reunite with him as a couple when she calls him, but then turns his attention to making Carly happy by offering to take her to the Father-Daughter Dance with Gibby, although both of them are rejected by Carly's sobbing. After Colonel Shay appears and escorts her to and back from the event, he announces he has to leave, eventually leading Carly to decide upon moving to Florence, Italy with him. In the studio, Freddie packs up his equipment, and starts telling Carly about helping Gibby take care of his new pet weasel when Carly places her hand on his. The two of them end up sharing a final kiss before she leaves.
In February 2014, Freddie guest stars in the crossover spin-off Sam & Cat. Sam's roommate Cat Valentine calls him out of jealousy after Sam begins to bond Cat's friend Jade West. Sam later calls Cat's close friend Robbie Shapiro and kisses him out of spite. Freddie and Robbie later discover that they are being used so Robbie decides to hang around with Freddie, much to his annoyance. After falling in a giant fish tank and being bitten by poisonous fish, Freddie and Robbie end up in hospital, leading to everyone calling a truce. Freddie then returns to Seattle.
Spencer Shay.
Spencer Shay (Jerry Trainor) is Carly's older brother. When Carly's dad was called overseas, she went to live with Spencer, who turned their loft into both a workspace and gallery for his wacky sculptures. Spencer is off-beat and rarely acts his age, but acts responsibly and seriously when it counts. Though often spontaneous and unreliable, Spencer has been shown as being extremely protective of Carly, especially in episodes such as "iQuit iCarly", when he sees Carly about to fall out of a window and sprints to her rescue, and "iLook Alike", when he would not approve her going to a mixed martial arts fight. In "iWanna Stay with Spencer", when Carly was being sent to live with her grandfather against her and Spencer's wishes, Spencer gives their grandfather Carly's asthma inhaler, despite her not having an asthma attack since she was seven. He tells their grandfather that he had kept all these years in case she needed it and demands he takes it with them, but after seeing how much Spencer really cares about Carly by keeping the inhaler all this time, their grandfather allows her to stay with him. In the alternate reality shown in "iChristmas," it is revealed that if Spencer was born "normal," Carly would have never met Sam and Freddie, Sam would be stuck in a juvenile detention center, Spencer would be engaged to Marissa Benson, and "iCarly" would not exist.
In addition to making sculptures, he has been shown to be an incredibly talented artist; while trying to teach Carly to draw in "iMust Have Locker 239", he quickly draws a professional-looking rabbit without even looking at the pad, much to Carly's amazement. However, when Spencer tries to get involved in something besides sculpting, it tends to spontaneously set itself on fire as a running gag, despite the object usually not being flammable (such as a cymbal). He is often the focus of the subplot for each episode, in which he usually finds himself in a strange situation. An odd interest of his is dressing up like a woman seen in "iWant My Website Back" and in "iLost My Mind". He also enjoys drinking milk in the shower, as stated in the episode "iGot A Hot Room".
In several episodes, it is stated that Spencer went to law school (because of his father's wishes) for three days before dropping out. Spencer did not tell his father that, claiming that he is busy.
Spencer is constantly being attacked and tortured by a trouble-making boy, who lives in the apartment building, named Chuck Chambers. The conflict started when he was covering for the doorman Lewbert in "iHurt Lewbert". Chuck has been seen in several episodes as a worthy enemy, because of his "sweet" personality, and martial arts skills.
He has also had numerous girlfriends throughout the series, including Veronica from a grocery store (whom he has had a crush on since he first saw her) in "iMake Sam Girlier" and a very high class woman in "iWon't Cancel The Show".
It is revealed that Spencer pulled numerous pranks during his youth in "iGet Pranky". After helping Carly pull a prank, his love for it was reignited, and he soon began to set up constant pranks at the expense of almost everyone, especially Carly. At her wit's end, Carly calls some of his old school friends (all of whom that came were victims from one of his pranks) to talk him out of his refueled habit. When she leaves, however, they resort to beating up Spencer since they still haven't forgiven him for it. Despite this, Spencer gets the message. In "iParty with Victorious" it is shown that Spencer has a book club with "only" ladies. To Carly, Sam, and Freddie's amazement they think that it is not the most manly thing in the world, Spencer also agrees. In iLost my Mind this book club reappears, exchanging fruit tart recipes.
Gibby.
Orenthal "Gibby" Cornelius Gibson (Noah Munck) is a friend and classmate of Carly, Sam, and Freddie and the show's breakout character. Due to his odd personality and pudgy appearance, he is an outcast at school, although he does have a few friends. He used to be known for taking off his shirt in all episodes he appeared in. Since Season 4, he has not taken his shirt off and stated in "iStill Psycho", he said he takes his shirt off "less frequently now." He often appears on "iCarly" to assist Carly, Sam, and Freddie. Gibby started off as an occasional recurring character of the show, but was promoted to a main character by Season 4. Gibby has a little brother named Guppy (played by Munck's younger brother), who is seen in the episodes "iPsycho", "iSell Penny Tees", "iDo", "iStart a Fan War", and "iBust a Thief". In "iMove Out", he has a pet bulldog named Grubbles. A running gag in many episodes usually has many characters yelling "Gibby!" to him, either when they are aggravated or annoyed by him. Since becoming a series regular, Gibby often announces his presence upon entering a room with his own name deepened voice: "Gibbeh!" It was revealed in the episode, "iStill Psycho", that his birth name is Orenthal Gibson.
Much like Freddie, he is often a victim of Sam's pranks, but she has shown to have more respect for him. In "iSpeed Date", his last name is finally revealed as Gibson at his house's postbox saying "The Gibsons" and reveals he has a girlfriend named Tasha. A very attractive girl, she only has small part in the episode. This surprised Carly, Sam, and Freddie, because they feel that Tasha is somewhat out of Gibby's league. In "iEnrage Gibby", Tasha returns and has a larger role, showing much affection towards Gibby, it also implies that she is at least 16 years old after Gibby said he would walk her to her car. In this episode, Gibby is shown to be ruthless and jealous, but in a comedic way. He is also shown to be a skilled kickboxer. Gibby is portrayed to be a very capable fighter, almost to the level of Sam, as shown in "iPsycho", where he succeeds in breaking into and smashing down a barricaded door. In the episode "iCan't Take It", Gibby is shown to be a strong singer when he serenades Sam and Freddie after he has a change of heart about trying to break them up. He also reveals in "iMeet the First Lady" that he thought Spencer was her father. He says this again in "iGoodbye".
His mom Charlotte went on a date with Spencer in "iFix a Pop Star", but they broke up because he looked too much like Carly to her and she looked too much like Gibby to him. His parents are divorced. He also has some emotional problems because he is the main target for most bullies (mostly Sam in the first three seasons).
He is very good friend with Spencer. In "iKiss", he became Carly's replacement in Spencer's football training. In "iCarly Awards", Spencer gave him the awards and he gave them to Carly and Sam. In "iQuit iCarly", he became Spencer's "boat boy" and he helped him defeat the Pirates. In "iPsycho", Spencer finds out that Gibby is not allowed to go to the camp anymore, so he cheers him up by inviting him to "Camp Spencer". In "iGot a Hot Room" his grandpa gives Spencer a haircut. In "iSell Penny-Tees", he introduces Spencer to Fugtor, his bus driver from Uzbekistan, for translate the phrases of Krustacia, Spencer's potential girlfriend from Uzbekistan, but the driver only spoke Uzbek and ended up falling for Krustacia, much to Spencer's dismay. In "iOMG", Gibby felt bad about hurting Spencer in the experiment. In "iParty with Victorious", he revealed he is skilled in massage therapy by aiding Spencer, so Spencer refused to drive the rest of the gang to Los Angeles unless Gibby was allowed to accompany them. Gibby also hosts the show with Carly and Sam doing things with sets.
Gibby also proclaims in "iSaved Your Life" that he and his family don't have cable television.
Recurring characters.
Marissa Benson.
Marissa Benson (Mary Scheer) is Freddie's stereotypically overprotective, and sensitive safe-cautious mom, first appearing in "iWanna Stay with Spencer". She constantly treats her son like a child and is very worried about him getting hurt or having relationships with girls (especially Carly), but in "iWill Date Freddie", she wanted Carly to love him. Marissa constantly embarrasses Freddie in public, often by making him follow all of her strange rules that she has. In the episode "iMove Out", it is revealed that her pregnancy with Freddie lasted eleven months. She does not seem to care about other people's apologies as seen in the special "iSaved Your Life". She has a somewhat negative relationship with Carly and Spencer, except for "iParty with Victorious," when she and Carly actually have a nice conversation. She doesn't really have a negative relationship with Sam however. In addition to the episodes named above, she has appeared in "iWanna Stay With Spencer", "iNevel", "iStakeout", "iCarly Saves TV", "iFence", "iHurt Lewbert", "iGo to Japan", "iPie", "iChristmas", "iLook Alike", "iFind Lewbert's Lost Love", "iMove Out", "iBloop", "iBeat The Heat", "iSam's Mom," "iWill Date Freddie", "iParty with Victorious", "iCan't Take It", "iQ", "iStill Psycho", "iBalls", "iToe Fat Cakes", "iOpen a Restaurant", "iShock America", "iGet Banned", and "iGoodbye". She also has a fear of germs shown in iToe Fat Cakes and iCan't Take It.
Lewbert.
Lewbert Sline (Jeremy Rowley) is the mean, vain doorman of Carly's apartment. He has a large, noticeable wart on his left cheek. In "iFind Lewbert's Lost Love", he reveals that the wart developed because of his abusive ex-fiancee, Marta. Her over-obsessiveness caused Lewbert to change his middle and last name, lose his good looks, his job as a supermodel, move to Seattle, and go crazy. He is later sent to jail (by smacking a police officer on the face and "admitting" that he was the one who was stealing the TV remotes) so he can escape Marta.
He is featured on the bit "Messin' with Lewbert" on iCarly, in which Carly, Sam and Freddie pull pranks on him, once going so far that they accidentally blew his wart off his face with an "exploding muffin basket", made to shoot confetti, but blew up as an explosive. Afterwards, he had a short-lived romance with Freddie's mother. However, this did not last because of his attitude after Freddie fell down the stairs while wearing "open-toed shoes", which was actually a ruse by Carly and Sam to end the relationship. Lewbert is loosely based on an enraged customer Rowley played in a "Blockblister" segment on "The Amanda Show". Lewbert appears in: "iWant More Viewers", "iWanna Stay with Spencer", "iScream on Halloween", "iHeart Art", "iHurt Lewbert", "iGo to Japan", "iTake On Dingo", "iFind Lewbert's Lost Love", "iEnrage Gibby" and "iBeat the Heat" and he was later mentioned in Season 4 episode, "iHire an Idiot." He is not seen or mentioned in Season 5 but he returns in the sixth season premiere, "iApril Fools" and the series finale, "iGoodbye". In iGoodbye Lewbert was sick and sneezed on Spencer, which in return made Spencer sick.
T-Bo.
Terrence "T-Bo" Bo () is the manager at the Groovy Smoothie (a parody of Jamba Juice). He often tries to get his customers to buy random foods as well as smoothies, such as bagels, bell peppers, doughnuts and pickles. These foods are always skewed onto a stick. T-Bo says he has a degree in "Smoothology". He is a close friend of Carly, Spencer, and the rest of the gang. After "iQ", he rents a room from Mrs. Benson.
T-Bo appears in: "iWant my Website Back", "iDate a Bad Boy", "iTwins", "iCook", "iSpeed Date", "iHave my Principals", "iQuit iCarly", "iGot a Hot Room", "iSam's Mom", "iGet Pranky", "iSell Penny-Tees", "iDate Sam & Freddie", "iQ", "iStill Psycho", "iMeet the First Lady", in the Extended Version of "iParty with Victorious" as the panda, later shown in a commercial, "iApril Fools", "iGo One Direction", "iOwn a Restaurant", "iHalfoween", "iBattle Chip", "iGet Banned", "iBust a Thief" and "iGoodbye". He is presumably a fan of One Direction as he took a photo of them when they were at the Groovy Smoothie with the iCarly Gang.
Socko.
Socko is a friend of Spencer who is only mentioned in several episodes. He and Spencer were friends in high school. He shares Spencer's love of unusual socks, and makes them, as stated in "iGo to Japan". Several members of Socko's family have names that match their jobs or personalities and are also off-screen characters; examples include Tyler, who makes ties; Otto, a used car salesman; Rob, a professional thief; Penny, who actually created Penny-Tees; Isaac, the optometrist; Taylor, who makes tuxedos; Bernie, a professional welder; Boomer, who sells bombs; and Ryder, who rides motorcycles. Like Carly and Spencer's mother and most of Freddie and Sam's family members, Socko and most of his family members have never been seen in the show in person except for Rob who stole back Carly and Spencer's couch and Bernie who burnt a pickle on "iCarly". He is never seen in the series at all.
Nevel Papperman.
Nevel Amadeus Papperman (Reed Alexander) hacks computers frequently and he is evil but quite sophisticated. Nevel appears in "iNevel," "iRue The Day," "iChristmas," "iGive Away a Car," "iWant My Website Back," "iFight Shelby Marx," "iPity the Nevel" and "iHalfoween." Nevel runs a popular website, "Nevelocity.com", on which he reviews other websites. He tends to have a "posh" personality which includes dressing formally all the time. At first, he had a crush on Carly and initially offered to interview her in order to get close to her, but she refused his romantic advances and rubbed his face with a special dip his mother made called "tapenade". Nevel tries to take revenge by writing a scathing review of iCarly.com on Nevelocity.com. He is extremely intelligent, often using complex plans that hide his involvement at first. Despite his intelligence, he often underestimates the "iCarly" gang, leading to his defeat. Most of his plans backfire, resulting in him suffering in some way and presumably causing his website to increasingly run out of business due to his corrupt, vindictive nature. It is revealed in the episode "iGive Away a Car" that his dream is to open his own haberdashery. He is not seen or mentioned at all in season 3 except for archived footage from "iBloop", but returns in the season 4 episode "iPity The Nevel". After not appearing in the rest of S4 or at all in S5, he appeared in "iHalfoween". He gives Carly and Sam candies that made their voices annoyingly deep, and later framed Freddie for it; however, after Freddie was punished, Carly states that she now acknowledges that Nevel's attack on them today was provoked, and after being nice to Nevel and making his two bodyguards disappear, he is finally punished himself. This infers that he never appeared again. He also appears in the self-titled video game. His middle name was revealed to be Amadeus in "iPity the Nevel".
Chuck.
Chuck Chambers (Ryan Ochoa) made an appearance in "iHurt Lewbert", when playing racquetball in the lobby, which Spencer got him grounded for by his father for two days. Since then, Chuck and Spencer became rivals and have clashed on several more occasions each time ending with Spencer winning and Chuck getting in trouble with his father except in "iFind Lewbert's Lost Love". He has a strange assortment of liquids such as a substance he squirted Spencer with and chunky jelly-like goo which he put into Spencer's motorcycle helmet. He reappears in "iBeat the Heat", where he comes to the Shays' apartment with his dad and sister, Gia, who Spencer finds attractive. Chuck also appears in "iReunite with Missy" and "iTwins". As revealed in "IBattle Chip", Chuck's latest prank on Spencer got him sent to military school and told his younger brother Chip taking over as Spencer's nemesis. He has an older sister named Gia and a younger Brother named Chip who appears in iBattle Chip. He doesn't appear in any more episodes after "iBeat the Heat", probably due to Ryan's commitments on filming Pair of Kings and because he is now in military school.
Guppy.
Guppy Gibson (Ethan Munck) is Gibby's younger brother. He appears in "iPsycho", coming over to Carly's house to stay with his brother, who is staying at "Camp Spencer". Guppy later frees the "iCarly" gang from a recording booth while Gibby distracts Nora (the girl who trapped the "iCarly" gang). Guppy is played by Noah Munck's real-life brother, Ethan. Like Gibby, Guppy likes taking his shirt off, but unlike Gibby, he rarely talks and is mostly shown speaking into Gibby's ears. In addition to "iPsycho", Guppy also appears in "iSell Penny Tees" when he was on the "iCarly" webcast, "iDo" when he was riding in his little flame car that is attached to Gibby's bike, in "iStart A Fan War" in which he, Gibby, and their grandfather are driving to Webicon. His signature phrase (towards Gibby) is, "Happy birthday!"; when Carly, Sam, and Freddie are trapped in Nora's basement in "iPsycho", they make a code and send it to Gibby, in which "every fourth word" is a code phrase. He also appears to have psychological problems because in "iStart A Fan War" he says he "hears voices again". He reappears two seasons later in episode "iBust a Thief".
Charlotte.
Charlotte Gibson (Deena Dill) is Gibby's attractive mother. She was dating Spencer in "iFix a Pop Star", but he broke up with her because he thinks she looks too much like her son Gibby and causing her to think of his resemblance to Carly. She appears also in "iGo Nuclear" when Sam gives Gibby a wedgie and she needed to give him his new underwear, "iPsycho" when Gibby went to Camp Spencer in Spencer and Carly's Loft, and in "iEnrage Gibby" offering Gibby a snack while he was punching a punching bag.

Ms. Francine Briggs (Mindy Sterling) is a mean English teacher that Carly and her friends like to tease, and one of Spencer's former teachers when he attended Ridgeway Middle School and former co-principal of Ridgeway Middle School. She first appeared in "iPilot". It is revealed in the episode "iSpy A Mean Teacher" that she likes to exercise in her swimsuit and she is obsessed with Randy Jackson. She returned in Season 3's episode "iHave My Principals" and makes a brief appearance in "iBelieve in Bigfoot". She plays the bagpipes, much to the hatred of the students, and feels that iCarly is bad for the young society. She has a bullhorn, and commonly uses it in the school hallways. Ms. Briggs doesn't return to the series for seasons 4 and 5, but she returns in the season six premiere, "iApril Fools". She is in love with Mr.Howard and they like to kiss in the teacher's lounge in their spare time after school.
Mr. Howard (David St. James) is a mean math teacher and detention moderator with an extremely unpleasant personality. A vindictive, hateful, perpetually-angry person that hates practically everything – laughter, children, and even his wife. Everyone at Ridgeway, including Carly and her friends as well as Principal Franklin, dislike him in return. In recent episodes however, he has shown some respect towards Carly, Freddie, and Gibby (not to Sam, though). He appears in "iParty with Victorious" when he seems very fond of Steven (Carly's boyfriend). Later he catches Carly and Sam texting in class and force them to say their texting conversation to the class. Sam later states she texted "colon P" (:P) to Carly, and Mr. Howard says he knows all about "Cole and Pete", which makes the class laugh and Mr. Howard confused on the joke. He returns in the episode "iOpen a Restaurant" where he finds out about the secret food joint Gibby had opened in the old school basement. He convince Principal Franklin (who is there enjoying himself) to close it down to which Franklin agrees to do. It's not until Mr. Howard leaves the basement, Principal Franklin blind-sides his request and tells Gibby to keep it open. It is rumoured his wife broke up with him for cheating on her. He is in love with Ms. Briggs and they like to kiss in the teacher's lounge a lot as mentioned in iTwins. He is the former co-principal of Ridgeway Middle School.
Mr. Devlin (Adrian Neil) is a history teacher at Ridgeway Middle School. He is known for being snotty and very strict to his students, even in his former position as lunchroom monitor. He also despises 3-hole punched paper, as revealed to Carly in the episode "iPromise Not to Tell", when he keeps Carly from getting straight "A"s by giving her a "B" on a history paper making Carly get a "B+" for the semester. He teaches very fast, and if ever asked to slow down, he says no and keeps talking. He also made an appearance in the episode "iKiss", when he tried to help Freddie stand up for himself and shouts "I am Freddie Benson and I have never kissed a girl!", causing everyone to laugh. Embarrassed and running away to avoid being responsible for the outburst, he tells everyone to stop laughing, and calls Freddie an "unfortunate misfit" while he runs off. He is from England, which explains his accent.
Miss Lauren Ackerman (Jessica Makinson) is a mentally unstable, verbally abusive, and possibly bipolar history teacher at Ridgeway. She only appeared in the episode "iHave A Lovesick Teacher", where she temporarily dated Spencer after her former boyfriend dumped her. Anytime she is dumped, she is extremely mean, abusive and unforgiving to her students, in ways such as giving them large homework assignments on chapters they have not read, and giving people F's on quizzes without letting them be taken. While dating Spencer, however, she is kind and giddy, even suggesting that her class go ice skating. She is often possessive, needing to know where Spencer is at all times during the day. When Spencer breaks up with her, she goes back to being crazy and this time making the primary characters do ridiculous punishments, such as making Carly and Freddie do jumping jacks during class and making Sam wash her car. She is arrested for admitting on "iCarly" that she illegally downloaded 500 songs on her PearPod (parody of the iPod) for Spencer as a present. It was actually a set-up by Carly and her friends to put an end to everybody's misery.
Mr. Stern (Joseph Buttler) is a teacher at Ridgeway Middle School. He is very strict and usually seen coming out of the teacher's lounge when there is an emergency.

In addition to that episode, he was in "iLike Jake", "iDon't Want to Fight", "iGot Detention", "iMake Sam Girlier" and "iSaved Your Life".
Mr. Henning (Andrew Hill Newman) is a hippie science teacher at Ridgeway Middle School. Spencer once had him as a science teacher, but complained that Mr. Henning smelled like rotting wood. He stresses the importance of being environmentally friendly, but does so in the wrong ways, and as a result, he tends to give the majority of his students poor grades because they were doing what is supposed to be correct, but not correct by his standards (e.g. in "iGo Nuclear", Freddie created a high-tech and expensive composting machine, but was marked down for polluting the air by importing worms from Portugal). He is later mentioned in "iBeat the Heat".
Superintendent Harold Gorman (Weston Blakesley) is a Superintendent at Ridgeway Middle School and Principal Franklin's boss, and appeared in "iHave My Principals". He has an abnormally low voice, which at first, stunned Sam. He also appears to have a strong hatred of fun, and fires Franklin simply for appearing on "iCarly" and playing one of their games, something he feels is below a principal, but proves he has a big heart when he rehires Franklin later in the episode.
Mr. Wimbley (William Cowart) appears in "iPromise Not to Tell" as the computer teacher, where Carly distracted him so Freddie could hack the school's network firewall. He is known to have a surly personality, particularly when he tells his students to complete exercises 7 and 9. When Carly asks Wimbley about exercise 8, Wimbley exclaims in a whiny voice "I'm in charge!".
Mr. Connick (Jonathan Spencer) was a teacher who recommended Carly to go to his brother-in-law Dr. Rick Schaffer, who is a plastic surgeon, because he thinks Shelby Marx will disfigure Carly's face in "iFight Shelby Marx".

Students.
Missy Robinson (Haley Ramm) was Carly's best friend, because both of their fathers were stationed at the same naval base at Seal Beach when they were 7, all before Carly met Sam. In "iReunite with Missy", she constantly tries to get rid of Sam so she can be Carly's best friend again. Carly finds out about her plan and ends her friendship with her. She left for a six-month sea cruise, which Freddie originally won and gave to her to get rid of her threat to "iCarly", and vomited because of her seasickness.
Valerie (Carly Bondar) was Freddie's girlfriend in "iWill Date Freddie", but was actually using him for her webshow so that it could overshadow "iCarly". When Sam and Carly found out about this, Freddie did not believe them, but later talked to Valerie, who revealed the truth. She was able to manipulate people; her actions were evident in attempting to use Sam as well for her webshow, and trying to get Carly to give up her show. At the end of the episode, on her webshow (called "The Valerie Show"), Valerie was supposed to show her recent trip from Idaho, but the monitor fell on her head, and she said "I don't know what to do now." She was not seen after that, but was mentioned in "iKiss".

In "iTake on Dingo", she was the first one to hint Dingo Studios ripping off of them, because her little brother was watching a show on Dingo, "Totally Teri". She then made an appearance in "iFight Shelby Marx" and finally in the Christmas episode when she claimed that Carly's boyfriend Nevel was looking for her. Wendy is known to gossip about the newest things around the school. She can be seen in the background of Ridgeway when the bell rings.
Wesley (Colin Spencer (Season 1), Victor Kelso (Season 7) ) is one of Freddie's friends. He is very skilled in beat boxing, which he frequently does, much to other people's annoyance.

He is never seen after "iGot Detention".
Duke (Doug Brochu) is a psycho student in Ridgeway who likes to wrestle. He appeared in "iHatch Chicks" as Freddie's lab partner, and in "iLike Jake", when Freddie got pushed around while Duke and his friend were fighting.

Duke is never seen after Season 1.
Tasha (Nicole Anderson) is a girl at Carly's school who only appeared in "iNevel". Sam, Carly, and Freddie did not like her, and Sam even said, "I wanna do bad things to that chick."

Jocelyn (Cynthia Dallas) is a rude senior who appears in "iMake Sam Girlier". She is seen bullying the students in Ridgeway and torturing them (e.g. holding a younger student by his legs for not saying "bless you" after she sneezed). Later in the episode, she loses a fight against Sam in the Groovy Smoothie. Jocelyn is never seen or mentioned probably because she has graduated.
Jonah (Aaron Albert) was Sam's boyfriend in "iHate Sam's Boyfriend." He was shown to be just as obnoxious and rude as Sam, a personality which made Sam fall in love with him.

Freddie fixes the problem by digitally altering his voice to make it sound better, and Jake gets back together with his girlfriend the next day. He is never seen nor mentioned after this.
Magic Malika (Skyler Day) only appeared in "iSpeed Date" as a date for Freddie to the Girls Choice dance. She had a very odd and ridiculous personality. She is a great magician, supposedly making a ball of paper vanish, making herself vanish and make Gibby appear, and making Freddie's cellphone float in the air.
Pete (Graham Patrick Martin) is Sam's love interest in "iMake Sam Girlier". He praised Sam for being tough and aggressive during her birthday party, which made Sam want to change into a more girlier image. Pete tells her later on that he prefers dating a girl who can kiss well and beat someone up when she needs to, rather than dating a "daffodil." Pete is never seen nor mentioned after this. Also it is never stated what happened to his relationship with Sam.
Shane (James Maslow) was Carly and Sam's crush in "iSaw Him First", who Carly and Sam found very attractive. He fell down an elevator shaft after he tried to storm out of the room after he got tired of Carly and Sam's arguing over him. He was shown to survive with major injuries.

He is played by James Maslow who is more recently seen as a main character in the Nickelodeon TV series Big Time Rush as James Diamond.
Shannon Mitchell (Annamarie Kenoyer) was Gibby's crush in "iWin a Date". In turn, she appeared to have a crush on Freddie, but Freddie wanted nothing to do with her. The iCarly gang set her and her friends up to be on a blind date for a chance to go out with Gibby, but after Shannon showed up alone, Gibby chose the wrong girl (Carly). Then, they go on a triple date at The Cheesecake Warehouse (a parody of The Cheesecake Factory) with pairs Carly and Gibby; Sam and Reuben; and Freddie and Shannon.

Minor characters.
Officer Carl (Christopher Michael) is a police officer that appeared in "iWant More Viewers" and "iMove Out". He arrests Spencer in "iWant More Viewers" due to a sign that he and Freddie made, that malfunctioned and caused a series of accidents, spelling out "Pee on Carl." He later appears in "iMove Out." He refuses to arrest the petographers for vandalizing the iCarly studio because they took pictures of his daughter's bunny for free. He then gives Carly a ticket for their car seat prop not having a front license plate. Carly angrily replies that it is a prop and Carl exclaims "So are you!" He also still hasn't forgotten about the sign's malfunction. He hasn't made any more appearances since then.
Aspartamay (Jack Black) is Spencer's video game rival in "iStart a Fan War". He and Spencer come face-to-face at Webicon. At the end of the show, Aspartamay was "killed" by Carly by stealing his jewel revealing that it's his life force. He sings a song before his "death" and falls to the ground.
Pam Puckett (Jane Lynch) is the mother of Sam Puckett (and her sister Melanie) who appears only in "iSam's Mom". During the first three seasons, she was mentioned in almost every episode, but had never been seen in person. Whenever Sam mentioned her, it was either something negative, or something that would gross out people. She is described as "poor", "desperate", and "hostile". Generally, she is indeed hostile to Sam, in which, Sam is hostile in the same manner. It is shown in "iSam's Mom" that she is somewhat desperate since she asks a stranger if he would like to marry her. She likes Melanie more than Sam, seeing the highly noticeable difference between the two. This gets on Sam's nerves when she compares her to Melanie, which causes another argument. She is notably known in the series for "frequent dating" (something mentioned by Sam in nearly every episode) and "driving issues", as shown in "iMust Have Locker 239". It is also revealed that she has a love interest for Italian men, as mentioned by Sam in "iGot a Hot Room" so this means Sam and Melanie could be half Italian. At the end of "iSam's Mom", they make up and reconcile their differences. She reappears onscreen in the episode "iShock America" wearing a bikini, but only the lower-half of her body is seen and she has no lines.
Krustacia (Irina Voronina) is Spencer's date in the episode "iSell Penny Tees". She is a foreign woman from Uzbekistan. She speaks no English at all, so Spencer has to use hand motions to communicate with her. In the end of this episode, Gibby invites his Uzbek bus driver named Foogtor to Carly and Spencer's loft to teach Spencer Uzbek. It turns out Foogtor's brother is the one who can translate causing Spencer to yell "well why didn't you ask the brother?". Krustacia and Foogtor walk out of the loft. Krustacia and Foogtor are never seen again after that.
Gordon Birch (J. D. Walsh) and Jodi Flooger (Rakefet Abergel) are a couple from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They only appear in the special "iDo". Gordon asks Jodi to marry him live on an iCarly episode, Jodi says yes, and Gordon wants to sing Miranda Cosgrove's song "Shakespeare". He tries to sing it both on iCarly and at the wedding but both times, he got nervous and urinated on himself. At the wedding Carly sings the song for Gordon. Spencer walks in on iCarly when Gordon proposes to Jodi. Jodi immediately falls in love with Spencer after already telling Gordon she would marry him. Jodi loves the song Gordon wrote for her, so at the end of "iDo" she decides to marry him. Jodi and Gordon are not seen after iDo probably because they live halfway across the country.
Note: At the wedding, Carly and Sam are the bridesmaids, and Freddie is Gordon's best man.
Harper (Leon Thomas III) is the leader of the band that played in "iCarly Saves TV." He played the piano on the TV show and sang a song on guitar on the webshow.

Greg Horvath (Kevin Symons) is the CEO of the DAKA Shoe Company (also mentioned in "Drake and Josh") in "iPromote Techfoots". He hires the iCarly kids to endorse their new athletic shoe, the Techfoot, on their webshow. After the kids discover that the shoes have many defects, they try to get the company to recall their product, Instead, Horvath threatens to sue iCarly for breach of contract. Luckily, Spencer put his three days of law school to work, and discovered a loophole in the contract, which requires the iCarly gang to only say "positive" things about the Techfoots. The kids then proceed to highlight all the shoe's defects on the show, in a sarcastic but positive matter. Realizing that he has been outsmarted, Horvath is forced to buy out the kids' contract. If he refused, he would be countersued for tricking the kids into advertising the faulty shoes.
Mr. Galini: was the Italian owner of Galini's Pie Shop, featured in "iPie". He was hospitalized for an unknown reason, and died a few days later. He was 97 years old at the time of his death, and was survived by his granddaughter, Trudy. On the morning of Mr. Galini's death, Spencer called the hospital and was informed that Mr. Galini had "checked out." Spencer apparently misunderstood what the hospital was saying, and thought that Mr. Galini had been released. It wasn't until he arrived at the pie shop (to purchase more pies) that he learned from Mario, Mr. Galini's employee, that Mr. Galini had passed away. The iCarly gang went to Mr. Galini's wake a few days later, in the hopes of finding his pie recipes, which Trudy had told them was "in his computer," at least according to her grandfather (although Trudy was never able to find them). Spencer and Carly provided a distraction while Sam and Freddie tried to find the recipes in the computer. During an argument, Sam and Freddie wound up knocking over the computer and breaking it. Then, Carly discovered that the pie recipes were hidden, literally, in the computer itself. With the recipes recovered, the pie shop was saved from being closed.
Mario (Jim Pirri): an Italian immigrant friend of Mr. Galini who works at Mr. Galini's pie shop. He told Carly and the gang that Mr. Galini died (which Spencer thought he was released from the hospital to make more pies). His first and only appearance was in "iPie". Mario has worked with Mr. Galini at his pie shop as a cashier at the pie shop for twenty years. Then, when Mr. Galini died, he was about to close down the pie shop but sold cherries and water on the last day of the shop's business. Then, when the iCarly trio found the pie recipe, he went back to work with his niece or niece-in-law Trudy.
Trudy Galini (Wendy Haines): is the granddaughter of Mr. Galini, seen in the episode "iPie". She is very awkward and weird, and seems to lead a depressing life. Her habits include eating packets of sweetener, twirling her hair, and attempting to kiss Spencer, with whom she went out only once. However, Spencer's motive in dating her was only to be able to get Mr. Galini's pie recipe after he had passed away. She aspires to become an actress, but at the end of the episode, Trudy says that she will give up her dream of becoming an actress to re-open the pie shop and run it.
Shelby Marx (Victoria Justice) appears in "iFight Shelby Marx". She is the youngest champion in the CFC and becomes a friend of Carly, Sam and Freddie. After Nevel tricks her into believing Carly meant to tackle her grandmother, she, Freddie, Carly, Gibby and Sam get their revenge on him. Victoria Justice later made an appearance in "iParty with Victorious" starring as her Tori Vega character from "Victorious". Conveniently enough in regards the Tori character, Sam says to Carly: "She looks like that Shelby Marx chick you fought". Shelby has not been seen since "iFight Shelby Marx".
Tongue Boy (Nick Afanasiev) is a recipient of an iCarly award for "most interesting yet frightening tongue of all time" in the episode "iCarly Awards." After receiving his award, he wiggles his tongue in the faces of Carly and Sam, and then reaches his tongue towards Spencer, who exclaims, "Don't do that!"
Ginger Fox (Betsy Rue) only appears in "iFix a Popstar". She is a parody of singer Britney Spears. She was once a Pop Music Award-winner but is revealed to have lost her talent and gone crazy, throwing forks at people when she is angry. Ginger has a 6-month-old son named Billy, is divorced, and tries to teach her rabbit to do tricks, but never does. Ginger fired her director because "he kept telling what to do". The iCarly crew were hired to make a music video for her comeback, and despite Ginger's lack of talent, they were successful, which left the iCarly group shocked, but not her fans. She is not seen after this but her songs can be heard in the background of iCarly and Victorious. Also her songs are sung by cast members of both shows.
Shadow Hammer (Aaron Aguilera) is a criminal who appears in "iSam's Mom". He had never been caught on video because he sneaks in before robbing a place and disables the cameras. This changes when Freddie uses his spy glasses and catches him, but when T-Bo and a newscaster talk about how he did, Freddie worries that Shadow Hammer will find him and beat him down. Spencer fixes the problem by changing the sign in his apartment to 8H instead of 8D. At the end of the episode, Shadow Hammer looks for Apartment 8D, and leaves when he sees the sign at Freddie's apartment reading 8H. It is not known what happens to the people who really reside in 8H and what happens to him.
Chip Chambers (Jacob Bertrand) is the more menacing younger brother of Chuck Chambers. When Chuck was put in Military School Chip took over as Spencer's Nemesis.

While preparing for a prank with another boy Gibby's phaser is thrown by them overloading in the process. It explodes sending Chip stuck to the wall. Spencer sprays cream on Chip's butt and leaves. Chip still stuck to the elevator yells "Hey, who's tickling my Butt?!". He is not seen after "iBattle Chip" probably because he realized that neither Spencer or any Of the iCarly quartet aren't worth messing with.
Mrs. Papperman (Wendy Braun) is Nevel's mother. She is only seen in "iNevel," in which she forced Nevel to remove a bad review he wrote about iCarly. Only her voice is heard in later episodes, including "iRue The Day" and "iFight Shelby Marx".

The family consists of Carly's Uncle Barry, Aunt Tess, and Cousins Ozlottis and Faye. Ozlottis wears a cone around his neck because he has a scab on his chin. They only appear in "iFence", where Carly asks Sam to eat with her while they visit, but as soon as Sam meets them herself, she hates them too. Carly tells her to stay since Spencer is not home yet and she cannot spend two hours with them, but Sam claims it cannot be that bad. Carly was forced to make a green-colored vegetable pudding for them, which tasted horrible to her. They aren't mentioned probably because Carly and Spencer don't like them and because they live in Fresno, California.
Kyoko and Yuki (Ally Maki and Harry Shum, Jr.) are two Japanese webstars whom iCarly competed against in "iGo to Japan". They attempted to ruin iCarly's chances of winning the iWeb Awards by stranding them in the middle of nowhere.

Gunsmoke (Anthony Vitale) is a bodyguard who appears in "iSam's Mom". Mrs. Benson hires him to protect Freddie when she worries about the Shadowhammer.

She then leaves in disgust and horror.
Detective Stuart 'Spanky' Stimbler (Ryan Bollman) is a childhood rival of Spencer. His name refers to the fact that he likes to spank unsuspecting people as a joke. He has a son and works for the Seattle Police Department. He and his partner use Carly and Spencer's apartment as a stakeout in an attempt to catch a video pirate. When the investigation was over, Spencer was able to trap Stimbler's son in a plastic transparent tube, and handcuffed Stimbler himself to the couch. Spencer then proceeded to get revenge by spanking Stimbler on the buttocks with one of his brooms. Stimbler is never seen again nor mentioned, probably because Spencer hates him.
Tasha (Emily Ratajkowski) is Gibby's girlfriend. She had a minor role in "iSpeed Date" and a major role in "iEnrage Gibby". In "iEnrage Gibby", Gibby temporally breaks up with her after believing that she was cheating on him with Freddie when he sees her on top of him, causing him to go crazy and plan to fight Freddie for revenge. After Freddie proves to Gibby that he was not trying to steal his girlfriend and that she had just tripped (proved by the lets watch food rot camera), Gibby and Tasha reconcile and walk away and the iCarly gang could not believe that Tasha liked Gibby.
Harry Joyner (Oliver Muirhead) is Spencer's favorite sculptor, and appears in "iHeart Art." According to Joyner, he has made a sculpture out of every substance known to man, and when he met Spencer for the first time, he was planning to make a human sculpture. When meeting Spencer, he saw many of his famous pieces, and then commented that "he didn't love them," and stated they were "amateur-ish at best". Spencer was heartbroken and considered giving up art. Carly went to Joyner and demanded he apologize to her brother. At first, he declined, remarking that he has no time for this, but when Carly points out how Spencer became depressed with Harry's vision over his art, Harry feels guilty and decided to go tell Spencer the real reason that he made the remarks (that he was "jealous" of Spencer's sculptures because they were "better than anything that he has done in a real long time"). They made amends and started to make a sculpture of a jaw for a local dentist, which was where Spencer worked before Joyner's apology. Joyner has never been seen or mentioned again.
Amber Tate (Rachel G. Fox) is a spoiled child actress that appears in "iCarly Saves TV", where she acts mean to the iCarly gang and her dog vomits on Freddie.
Granddad Shay (Greg Mullavey) is Carly and Spencer's paternal grandfather who lives in Yakima, Washington. In "iWanna Stay With Spencer", he attempted to get Carly to move with him because he thought Spencer was an irresponsible guardian. In the end, he allowed Carly to stay with Spencer after Spencer demanded he take her asthma inhaler with them even though Carly had not had an asthma attack since she was seven and was saving it "just in case". It is mentioned there, when he discusses with Spencer, that he is a lawyer. Ever since his visit, however, Spencer has become a little more serious with Carly. He loves to exercise and can do a handstand while walking.

She is loud and outgoing, and is considered insane and annoying by the iCarly gang. She has an awkward habit of wearing duck masks. It appears she switches fandom very quickly, going from iCarly to the band Spencer was in, claiming to be their biggest fan. She is gullible, as shown in "iWant My Website Back" when she accidentally gives away the iCarly site to Nevel. She is never seen or mentioned after that probably because the gang hate her and she lives in Tacoma.
Nora Dershlitt () is a psychotic and lonely girl who is a crazy fan of iCarly and has no friends except for her chicken Maurice and her parents leaving her to her own devices. Although Nora kissed a girl (Daniella Monet) from her school willingly, according to creator Dan Schneider, Nora was actually kissing her on her cheek. She appears in "iPsycho" (Season 3), where she kidnaps Carly, Sam, and Freddie, calling them her "angels," after they helped her become popular with the kids at her school. She apparently has a crush on Freddie as shown by having him be forced to kiss her through the glass of a room she trapped them in. Gibby has a lengthy fight with her and she seems to be able to keep up with him until his younger brother Guppy releases the iCarly gang and Sam finishes her off by pressing a pressure point in her shoulder (the fictional Vulcan nerve pinch) and knocking her out, where Nora waits for her arrest. Nora returns two seasons later in the sequel, "iStill Psycho", having been paroled from the past incident and seemingly turned over a new leaf. However, it was a ruse to trap the ICarly gain with her equally-psychotic parents helping her own Spencer hostage to make up for her 16th birthday.

They officially break up at the end of the episode after Carly and Sam make fun of his obsession with Pee-Wee Babies and he overhears them. He returns in "iBeat the Heat", where he is more eccentric then ever as he tries to kiss Carly and comes to the Shays' air conditioned loft because his Pee-Wee Babies cannot be in extreme hot or cold air or they will become misshapen.

She helps him get the bill by letting him get on her shoulders. After retrieving the bill, she falls down and Gibby drives off and forgets about her. She is last seen on the ground mumbling "Are we still going to get coffee?".
Cal (Jake Siegel) was Carly's assistant in "iGo Nuclear". He was helping her with a school science project during Green Week in Mr. Henning's class, so she would not have to serve the "Root & Berry" retreat. He was actually a criminal because he built illegal nuclear projects using black market uranium. His true self is not revealed until the end of the episode, when three police officers found out who he was after asking where he got his haircut in the Groovy Smoothie. He then bolts out of the shop and the officers reveal his criminal acts, forcing Carly to attend the "Root & Berry" retreat.
Mitch (Danny Woodburn) appears in "iChristmas." He is the guardian angel who granted Carly's wish for Spencer to become normal. When this affects her entire life, however, she soon regrets it and wants everything changed back. Having learned her lesson, Mitch returns Carly's life to normal. In the end, Carly sees a vision of Mitch earning his "wings" (in this case, a bucket of chicken wings).
Fleck and Dave (Daven Wilson and Joey Luthman) are two young teenage boys who cohost a web show, and appear in "iQuit iCarly." The two are good friends, but have very differing opinions, such as the personalities of Carly and Sam. This comes to a head when Fleck paints Dave's dad's car purple for a bit in one of their shows featuring the iCarly gang. An argument breaks out which results in Fleck and Dave separating. Carly and Sam try to patch the problem, but Fleck and Dave both make Sam and Carly think about how the two treat one another. This results in the separation of Carly and Sam. When Spencer helps Sam save Carly's life, they all become friends again. In the end, the four webshowees, along with Freddie, make a fake movie trailer called "The Blowing."
David Archuleta (David Archuleta) made his first appearance is "iRocked the Vote" competing with Wade Collins. David won the vote on "America Sings" (A parody of American Idol) thanks to Sam and Carly.
Cort and Ashley (Daniel Booko and Teresa Castillo) are two teenagers hired as interns in the episode "iHire An Idiot". Cort was hired unrespectively by Carly and Sam without Freddie's approval. Ashley was another intern hired by Freddie without Carly or Sam's permission, and this leads to Carly and Sam trying to get him to fire Ashley. Freddie proclaims that Carly and Sam have to fire Cort first and then he will fire Ashley, but this does not happen until the end of the episode. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Cort was kicked out of college because he was claimed to be dangerously stupid. Also, it is revealed that, unlike Cort, Ashley works at the Brilliance Bar at the local Pear Computers store (Freddie makes her act stupid to trick Carly and Sam into firing Cort). Cort is later mentioned in "iOMG". It is hinted that Cort and Ashley later dated after the end of "iHire an Idiot".

In disguise, Carly sees Steven give Tori a charm bracelet and says "It's one of a kind, just like you." then kisses her which is exactly what he did with Carly. After the iCarly gang take off their disguises, Tori walks in searching for Steven, and upon seeing iCarly exclaims "Oh my gosh iCarly! Do you know how inlove I am with your show?" then Carly replies "No, but I do know how inlove you are with my boyfriend." Carly explains everything to Tori and they agree they need to get revenge on Steven. When Steven walks into the closet where he and Tori are supposed to have there 100-day kiss, he is surprised to find Kenan Thompson who blows a loud horn in his ear, Carly, and Tori who are doing a live iCarly webcast and announce that Steven is both of their ex's and tell everyone that he is a no-good cheater.

<doc id="19848460" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19848460" title="QAGS">
QAGS

QAGS ("Quick Ass Game System") is a generic role-playing game system for use in freeform role-playing games. QAGS is not tied to any particular genre or setting, and has been used to run everything from paranormal teenagers to post-apocalyptic super-heroes to fantasy sailing adventure to gun-toting monster hunters to "hard-core" luchadore action to Regency romance to 80’s cartoons to Shakespeare meets Tarantino.
History.
In 1998, three gamers (Steve Johnson, Leighton Connor, and Dale French) published the First Edition of the game after a year of development. Since then, QAGS (pronounced "kwags") has been updated with a Second Edition, and the publisher, Hex Games, has continued to release games.
To date, Hex Games has used the core system for "M-Force: Monster Hunting In The 21st Century", "Rasslin’", "Qerth", "The Adventures Of Sindbad", "Rocket Jocks", "Weird Times At Charles Fort High", and "Funkadelic Frankenstein on the Mean Streets of Monstertown", as well as several stand alone adventures such as "Deep Space Rescue" and "The Dungeon Of Moderate Annoyance (Not Nearly So Bad As The Dungeon Of Infinite Pain)".
In 2001, Hex Games was the Gaming Guest of Honor at Marcon 36. In 2006, Hex was the "Gaming Guest" of Honor at Archon 30.
Game mechanics.
In QAGS, player characters are defined by six Words. Body, Brain, and Nerve represent the character’s physical, "intellectual" and mental (willpower and social skills, for example) abilities. Job, Gimmick and Weakness represent what the character does, what makes him unique in the world, and what limits him in a grand Shakespearean way. These last three Words are qualified. For example, a character’s Job might be “Animal Control Officer”, his Gimmick “Hide In Plain Sight”, and his Weakness “Dies if touches peanut butter”. Each of these six Words is assigned a Number ranging from 6 to 16. Skills, areas of knowledge that round out the character, with Numbers ranging from +1 to +5 are also assigned, and they will be used to modify target numbers when rolls are called for. Numbers are generated by using either the Qik Start system that relies on dice-rolling, or the Point Built system in which the player is given a certain number of points with which to create the character. 
Player characters are further fleshed out by assigning them a Tag Line (something that the character routinely says, such as “Jinkies, a Clue!”), WWPHITM (Who Will Play Him/Her In The Movie), and any number of Dumb Facts. 
When the Game Master determines that a character’s action goes beyond what would be considered normal or everyday, she decides what Word is applicable and use that Word’s Number as the target number. If no Word is applicable, the GM will use half the player’s Body, Brain or Nerve Number rounded down as a default target number. Any Skill modifiers are added to determine the modified target number. Then she asks the player to roll a 20-sided die; no other dice are required to play QAGS. The number rolled on the die is then compared to the modified target "number" assigned to the appropriate Word. If the roll is under the modified target number, the action succeeds; over the modified target number, a failure. If two characters are in opposition, hand to hand combat for example, then the higher successful role is the one that actually succeeds.
In an example of play, Our Hero, Rollo the Superspy, wants to impress Isvestia, a beautiful Ruritanian counterintelligence agent, at the casino in Monte Carlo. He adds his +2 skill in “Tango Dancing” to the 12 of his “Superspy” Job, which she will oppose with her 15 Nerve. He rolls a 13 while she rolls a 4. Both are "successful", but his roll, being higher, is the one that succeeds. The result should be that he has her eating out of his hand, but Rollo also has “Overplays His Hand” for a Weakness with a Number of 13. He rolls a 9, and the Weakness wins and takes effect, thus releasing Isvestia from her fascination.
Simple dice-rolling is augmented by the use of Yum Yums. Yum Yums are anything compact and edible, anything from hard candies to potato chips. Yum Yums may be used to buy automatic successes, chances to re-roll failed rolls, and to modify things like damage given and taken. They also give players a chance to take control of a game and determine details about the game world. Additional Yum Yums are handed out for advancing the plot, role-playing well, or making the GM snort lemonade out her nose.
In the play example of Rollo the Superspy (eyeballing Isvestia across the ballroom floor), he can throw the GM a Yum Yum instead of rolling dice, granting him an automatic success in his attempt to impress Isvestia. The GM again invokes his weakness, but Rollo can throw another Yum Yum to avoid having his Weakness take effect. Now Isvestia's ready to tell him "anything".
Complexity.
QAGS can be as complex or as simple as the GM and players want it to be, and the rules can be easily adapted to include whatever mechanic a new setting might require. For example "Rasslin’" needed to add a mechanic for resolving the showy combat of professional wrestling; "Rocket Jocks" needed rules for spaceship combat; and "Weird Times at Charles Fort High" needed an alternative point-build character generation system to balance the different paranormal characters.

Club One

Club One Fitness Centers is a San Francisco-based chain of health clubs and in-house gymnasium facilities managed on behalf of corporate clients.
The chain was founded in 1991 by a husband and wife team who had operated health clubs before. Jill Kinney had been a professional downhill ski racer, before opening a small club, the Physis Gym, in San Francisco. She later became Chief Operating Officer of a nationwide chain, and was responsible for opening the original Sports Club LA Noticing that nearly all health clubs were independent, she worked with future husband John Kinney to write a business plan for a multi-outlet health club. The couple obtained a founding investment from the Kikkoman soy sauce company, and opened their first gym in the Citicorp Center in San Francisco. It grew quickly during the dot com boom as many companies established in-house gyms as a perquisite for employees. 
The first corporate facility was started in 1995, after Autodesk, Inc. contacted the couple about opening an in-house gym exclusively for company employees. Similar concessions were opened for The Gap and Electronic Arts 
As of 2004 the chain had 19 public clubs, several dozen in-house gyms with more than 500,000 corporate members, and approximately 1,500 employees in ten states. The company manages health clubs at six Jewish Community Centers.

A1 (Bosnia and Herzegovina)

The A1 motorway is a motorway in Bosnia and Herzegovina that is part of the Corridor Vc and, together with two Croatian motorways (A10 and A5) and the Hungarian M6, will provide a modern and fast road connection from Budapest to Ploče, an important seaport on the Adriatic Sea.
The motorway will connect the capital Sarajevo with other large cities (such as Mostar and Zenica). It will also be the main link to Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Adriatic Sea and Central Europe.
By 2013, the completed section stretches from Sarajevo to Kakanj, while the sections Kakanj-Zenica, Josanica-Tarcin, Bijaca-Pocitelj and Svilaj-Odzak are currently under construction. 
By April 2013 53 km is completed while 64 km is under construction.<br>
On 20 June 2013, the 5 km section between Bijača and Kravice was opened. A new border crossing with Croatia opened on June 28.
The most complicated section of the road to build will be the Sarajevo-Mostar stretch. It will need viaducts and tunnels to cross the Dinaric Alps.
There is one open toll barrier in Josanica (4.80 KM).
In Bosnia and Herzegovina the E73/A1 passes near the following cities:
Significance.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Corridor Vc highway is the most important road project. Construction on the road has already begun. The intensified beginning of the construction will be a key starter of economic and social activities, and will enable Bosnia and Herzegovina to be connected to main European traffic network, as well as the European economic and social structure.
Construction of the highway will provide a motorway connection to neighboring countries and regions. It will improve transportation and improve the quality of life in the areas where the road will pass through. It will improve the economy. 
Transport Master Plan.
Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) funded provision of Transport Master Plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina (March 2001), which represents the first document in afterwar period at this level in transport area, and it was used as basis for many other studies and decisions, even for provision of Planning and Study Documentation for the Highway along the Corridor Vc.
This Study provided priority transport corridors in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were afterwards confirmed by subsequent studies, to a great extent.
At the same time, this Study defined main goals in transport sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Development Scenario by 2020. Development Scenario includes three phases:

History.
The Belgrade Zoological Garden was officially opened on 12 July 1936, by Belgrade mayor Vlada Ilic. The zoo was initially no larger than , but was expanded to about 14 hectares. During the Second World War, the zoo was bombed twice, in 1941 and 1944, heavily damaging the infrastructure and killing most of the animals. The zoo lost seven hectares of land.
Vuk Bojović became the director on 1 May 1986 and still holds that position.
Today, even though the zoo covers only seven hectares, it has over 2000 animals, including over 270 animals species. It is not accredited by any international zoo association because of its small size relative to the number of animals.

The Best Burger in New York

"The Best Burger in New York" is the second episode in the fourth season of the television series "How I Met Your Mother" and 66th overall. It originally aired on September 29, 2008.
Plot.
Future Ted begins by stating that when he first moved to New York City, it was an ugly, dirty place, but goes on to say that it changed, unfortunately, with good bars becoming banks, like Goliath National Bank, the bank Barney's company just bought, which he advises Marshall to get a job with. Lily rebukes this suggestion, saying even though Marshall had been to a lot of bad job interviews, he was still going to be an environmental lawyer.
Later, the group goes to the bar, and are advised by Wendy the waitress to have the burger, a new special. After an argument, they agree to try the burger, mainly because Robin hadn't eaten anything in two days due to a new diet. Once the burgers arrive (Robin's is late), the group all say how good the burger is, except for Marshall, who says it's just 'OK', seeing as he had the best burger in New York eight years ago.
Marshall explains that he was scared and bewildered when he first moved to New York, but quickly finds the city is nicer than he thought. While taking a walk, he accidentally finds a burger joint, and has the 'best burger in New York'. He also notices an autographed picture of Regis Philbin on the wall, saying how good the burger was. Afterwards, he rushes to tell Ted about the place, but quickly forgets where it was, being new to the city. Since then, Marshall has tried every burger joint he can in an attempt to find the place, even meeting with Regis, who says he can't find where the place is either, and is also desperate to find it. He gives Barney his number so he can call him if he finds the joint.
When Robin says she knows the place, the group rushes downtown to find it (before Robin can try her burger). On the way, Barney texts Regis telling him where to find the place, causing him to leave a TV show recording. They all order the burger (Robin's is late, again), and once more they agree it's an incredible burger. Unfortunately, Marshall says it's not the right burger. Marshall becomes desperate, and Lily says he's really upset about not getting a new job. The group resolves to find the place for Marshall, and ask a waitress for help. She tells them "this burger joint was modeled after another one, uptown".
Again, the group rush to the new joint. On the way, Regis calls, and Barney tells him about the new place. In frustration, Regis mangles a post box with his bare hands. Once they arrive, Marshall is sure it's the right location, but in its place is a Goliath National Bank ATM from Barney's bank. Lily attacks Barney, and Marshall admits the reason Barney's been talking up the bank is that Marshall got a job there. While they talk, a guy nearby promoting a strip club tells them the place isn't gone, but has just moved. After paying him, thanks to the ATM, he tells them where the place is.
Finally, the group reaches the joint, Marshall deems it to be the exact place, and the gang finally enjoys the burger together, as well as fulfilling Marshall's long search for it.
Barney's blog.
In his blog Barney compares himself to Regis Philbin and suggests some possible game show he would love to host such as: Is She Legal?; America's Wettest T-shirt; Fathers And Sons; The Next Great Tailor; Don't Forget Your Wallet.

Grigorovich DI-3

Grigorovich DI-3 (), ("Dvukhmyestnyi Istrebitel" - two-seat fighter), was a prototype two-seat fighter developed in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. It was intended to be a long-range escort fighter developed from the DI-2 with improved range and performance comparable to single-seat fighter aircraft of the time. DI-3 was a single-bay biplane of mixed construction with a twin-rudder tailplane of variable incidence. Although initial tests demonstrated flight characteristics comparable to Polikarpov I-5, the addition of armament and operational equipment caused significant degradation in performance and DI-3 did not enter mass production. The prototype was subsequently fitted with an enclosed cockpit and used as a VIP transport.

Stephan Braunfels

Professor Stephan Braunfels (born August 1, 1950) is a German architect.
Biography.
Stephan Braunfels was born on August 1, 1950. He completed his studies at the Technical University of Munich in 1975 and established his office in Munich in 1978. He is a nephew of the composer Walter Braunfels.
Early career.
Braunfels' first competition success along with his plans and critiques on urban design concepts for Munich formed the basis for the exhibition "Designs for Munich" shown in 1987 at the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt am Main. As an advisor to the City of Dresden in 1991-1993, Braunfels designed a master plan for the reconstruction of the historic city centre of Dresden. Braunfels opened his Berlin office in 1996.
Major projects.
Pinakothek der Moderne.
After the completion of his first projects in Munich and Dresden, Braunfels won several competitions. The first major competition he won was for Munich's Pinakothek der Moderne in 1992. This project took ten years to come to fruition and opened in late 2002 as one of the largest new museums in Germany. Braunfels garnered some prizes and lauding reviews for this building. 
Peter Schjeldahl, reviewing the Pinakothek der Moderne in the "New Yorker" (January 13, 2003), wrote: "it is a big but self-effacing, "invisible" building: on the outside, a bland concrete-steel-and-glass shoebox; on the inside, a dream of subtly proportioned, shadowless, sugar-white galleries that branch off from an airy, three-story rotunda. In the effulgent atmosphere, you may know where the walls are only by where the pictures hang. I gratefully watched colors combust in Kirchners and Noldes under translucent, all-skylight ceilings. (I'll never again think of Expressionist color as generally sour and arbitrary.) On an ordinary rainy Tuesday in November, the place was thronged with people in festive spirits. The Moderne is a great success.
German parliament buildings.
In 1994, Braunfels' design for the 81,000 square meter German Parliament office building -- Paul Löbe Haus—was awarded first prize. The home of German Parliament's offices and committee chambers opened in 2001 and is one of the most prominent structures in Berlin. In 1996 he was awarded first prize for another parliament building design, the 65,000 square meter Marie Elisabeth Lüders Haus, which houses the German Parliament's offices, library and repository. This second building opened to critical acclaim in 2003. 
These three projects are considered to be some of the largest scale projects in post-Cold War Germany and have established Braunfels as an architectural force in Germany.

German submarine U-44 (1939)

German submarine "U-44" was a Type IXA U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" that operated during World War II. She was ordered in November 1936 and laid down in September 1938 in Bremen. She was launched in August 1939 and commissioned in November.
During her service in the "Kriegsmarine", "U-44" conducted only two war patrols and sank a total of eight enemy vessels for a loss of 30,885 GRT. On 13 March 1940, she struck a mine that was located in field Number 7 off the north coast of the Netherlands. All 47 of her s crew members went down with the submarine.
Construction.
"U-44" was ordered by the "Kriegsmarine" on 21 November 1936 (as part of Plan Z and in violation of the Treaty of Versailles). She was laid down on 15 September 1938 by AG Weser, in Bremen as "Werk 949". "U-44" was launched on 5 August 1939 and commissioned on 4 November of that same year under the command of "Korvettenkapitän" Ludwig Mathes.
"U-44" had two MAN M9V40/46 supercharged 9-cylinder diesel engines, that put out as well as two SSW GU345/34 double-acting electric motors that produced and allowed her to travel at while surfaced and submerged. She had a range of at while on the surface and at while submerged. "U-44" had six torpedo tubes (four in the bow, two in the stern). She also carried a total of 22 torpedoes and had a 105 mm/45 deck gun with 110 rounds. She was equipped with the standard 2 cm FlaK 30 anti-aircraft gun. "U-44" had a crew of forty seven men, however she could hold up to fifty six. After being commissioned and deployed, "U-44" was stationed in the German port of Wilhelmshaven. This city was to be her home for the rest of her short career.
History.
"U-44" had a very short operational life. During her service with the "Kriegsmarine", she took part in only two combat patrols. After training exercises with the 6th U-boat Flotilla from 4 November to 31 December 1939, "U-44" was assigned as the front boat for the 2nd U-boat Flotilla on 1 January 1940. She was to remain a part of this flotilla until her loss.
First patrol.
The first of "U-44"s two patrols began on 6 January 1940 when she left Wilhelmshaven for the North Sea, eventually circumnavigating the British Isles, travelling as far south as the Bay of Biscay and Portugal. It was in these two locations that "U-44" sank her first (and last) merchant ships. Following these victories, she headed north again, travelling just north of the coast of Scotland and back into the North Sea. She then returned to Wilhelmshaven, arriving there on 9 February 1940. Over a period of thirty-five days, "U-44" sank eight merchant ships, for a total loss of 30,885 tons.
Second patrol.
Unlike her first outing, "U-44"s second patrol was a disaster, not even lasting through the first day. After spending more than a month in Wilhelmshaven, she began her second patrol on 13 March 1940. A few hours after leaving port, "U-44" entered minefield Number 7, just off of the northern coast of the Netherlands. This particular minefield was laid by the British destroyers , , , and . Upon entering the minefield, "U-44" struck one of the devices and sank at . All forty-seven of her crew were lost.
Previously recorded fate.
Sunk by on 20 March 1940.
Summary of Raiding Career.
During her service, "U-44" sank eight commercial ships for a loss of . All of these ships were sunk during her first patrol.

Bench (law)

Bench in legal contexts means simply the location in a courtroom where a judge sits. The historical roots of that meaning come from the fact that judges formerly sat on long seats or benches (freestanding or against a wall) when presiding over a court. In modern courtrooms, the bench is usually an elevated desk area that allows a judge to view the entire courtroom (see photo at right).
But the word also has a broader meaning in the law – the term "bench" is a metonym used to describe members of the judiciary collectively, or the judges of a particular court, such as the Queen's Bench or the Common Bench in England and Wales, or the federal bench in the United States. The term is also used when all the judges of a certain court sit together to decide a case, as in the phrase "before the full bench" (also called "en banc"). Additionally, the term is used to differentiate judges ("the bench") from attorneys or barristers ("the bar"). The phrase "bench and bar" denotes all judges and lawyers collectively.

It also presented original dramas, such as "The Lincoln Murder Case". Dale Wasserman wrote for the show, and it was Wasserman's "I, Don Quixote" on this series (November 9, 1959) that eventually was developed six years later into "Man of La Mancha". The plot and much of the dialogue is identical.
Other writers included Sidney Kingsley and Terence Rattigan.

I Heart NJ

"I Heart NJ" is the third episode in the fourth season of the television series "How I Met Your Mother" and 67th overall. It originally aired on October 6, 2008.
Plot.
Ted is complaining about having to travel so far to see Stella in New Jersey, as she is often asleep by the time he gets there. It also means he misses some key events with the group, like Barney trying to pick up a lesbian by dressing in feminine clothing, and Robin getting promoted. When he tells Stella about this, she suggests the group comes to New Jersey for a night out. At first, the group rejects this idea, making fun of New Jersey, and also reminding him of how much he hates the place himself. He talks them into accepting, and says that soon he will not have to go back again, as Stella and her daughter will move in with him after they are married.
Robin is sick of her job, as she often reports stupid stories and has to make bad, sometimes insensitive puns. After being offered a major anchor job, she immediately accepts, and makes her farewell broadcast, with a terrible speech (written by Ted).
On Saturday, Ted, Marshall, Lily and Barney head to New Jersey for a night out, but instead find that Stella's babysitter cancelled, and they have to stay in. Ted reminds them that being together is what's important, but Marshall, Barney and Lily are desperate to get back home. Stella overhears their complaining, and takes them into the basement, saying it's 'the coolest bar in New Jersey', with some board games and half a ping-pong table. Barney, after making a bad joke, asks someone to give him a fist bump, but no one agrees. He declares that he will not lower his arm until someone gives him a fist pound, but is still ignored.
Robin arrives, and says she has to go back to her old job. Lily and Barney manage to stop her, reminding her of how humiliating it was there, and Robin relents. Ted is shocked to find Stella expects him to move to New Jersey, and did not want to move in with him, thinking he was joking, as Manhattan is not a safe place to raise her daughter. She asks Ted to go to the local store to get some beer, where he continues to worry about living in New Jersey, as he feels he will never go back to the city. Marshall seems to love the idea of living out in New Jersey. Barney continues to make jokes, hoping for some 'respect', as he seems to be in some pain.
Robin manages to sneak a call to her old studio, and asks for her job back. Since her replacement is terrified of going on air, her producer agrees, but only if she can make it to the studio in time for the broadcast in half an hour. She steals Stella's daughter's bike, and sets off.
When Ted and Marshall get back, Ted confronts Stella about moving to New Jersey, and she responds that she does not want to uproot her daughter. She also states New Jersey is better than New York, a statement that upsets both Ted and Lily. They begin to argue over which is better, while Barney desperately asks someone to bump him.
Robin, meanwhile, is seen performing incredible stunts in order to make it to the studio in time, even backflipping on her stolen bike over a cab that has crashed in the road.
Lily suggests that Stella will grow to love New York, as Marshall did. Marshall reveals he hates New York, as the city is designed for people who are smaller than him, and actually loves New Jersey, with its big stores, lawns and cupholders on everything. Ted refuses to relent, and Stella storms out.
Ted goes to find her, but instead finds Stella's daughter Lucy, who was woken up by the argument. He reads her a bedtime story to get her back to sleep, then finds Stella, and agrees to move in with her, saying New Jersey wins.
Robin arrives at the studio just in time, pushing her nervous replacement out of the way, and immediately going on air. After her first story again contains a bad pun, she decides she was right to quit, and leaves. Barney and Lily watch, and Lily says they helped her do that, giving him the fist bump he desired. Despite this, he quickly makes another bad joke, and asks for a high five, which he does not receive, and is still asking later at the bar. Robin reveals she did not get the job she auditioned for, but was offered another, and is going to move to Japan. Barney, shocked, lowers his hand.
Critical response.
Donna Bowman of The AV Club rated the episode B+. IGN gave the episode 7.8 out of 10. Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pity rated the episode with a grade C+. Alan Sepinwall of "The Star-Ledger" was rather critical of the episode stating: "What bothered me about "I Heart NJ" was that it took Ted's simplistic view of Jersey and seemed to apply such broad, black-and-white thinking to everything." Joel Keller, who hails from New Jersey, also expressed disgust at the episode.

Ewan Crawford

Ewan Charles Crawford (born 8 April 1941) is an Australian judge and former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania.
Crawford was born in Launceston to parents Sir George and Lady Crawford. He went to Launceston Church Grammar School.
He became a student of law in 1959 and worked as an Associate to Chief Justice Stanley Burbury.
He graduated from University of Tasmania on 12 May 1964 with a Bachelor of Laws with Honours. He was employed by Douglas and Collins, Barristers and Solicitors, in Launceston as an employed solicitor. 
At his swearing-in, he relates that he had to send away his first client so that he could ask somebody to help him with his advice. He then gave the wrong advice to his second client, and had to call him back to set it straight. He took a year off in 1965 to travel overseas and returned as an employed solicitor in 1966. In 1968 he was made a partner of the firm. In that same year he married Robyn on 18 May, and they now have two sons and a daughter.
He was a Council Member of the Law Society of Tasmania between 1972 to 1984. He became President of the Law Society for 1979–1980. He was also involved in the Northern Regional Law Society and the Northern Area Legal Assistance Committee.
In 1982 fellow partner at the firm Douglas & Collins, Randall Askeland, murdered his wife Wendy Askeland. She was hit with an iron bar at least five times whilst in bed.

Idaho's 2nd congressional district

Idaho's 2nd congressional district is one of two congressional districts in the U.S. state of Idaho, in the eastern portion of the state. Beginning with the 2012 election, the district expanded westward and now includes most of Boise, the state capital and largest city.
After statehood in 1890, Idaho had a single seat in Congress through the 1910 election, a statewide at-large seat. Following the 1910 census, Idaho gained its second seat in the House; it was first contested in 1912, but the state did not immediately apportion into two districts. Through the 1916 election, both were statewide at-large seats. The first election in Idaho with two congressional districts was in 1918.
Following the 2010 census and redistricting, the 2nd district gained more territory in northeast Ada County, and now includes most of Boise, with all precincts north of Interstate 84. A significant increase in population directly west of Boise over the previous decade, in western Ada County and Canyon County, was responsible for the westward shift of the boundary. In Ada County, the 1st district continues to include Meridian, Eagle, and west Boise south of Interstate 84. 
Other major cities in the 2nd district include Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Twin Falls, and Rexburg. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a strong presence in the district; a member of the LDS Church has represented this district continuously since 1951. 
The district is currently represented by Mike Simpson, a Republican of Idaho Falls. A former dentist in Blackfoot, he was first elected in 1998; the seat opened when predecessor Mike Crapo successfully ran for the U.S. Senate

Through the 1916 election, both were statewide at-large seats. The first election in Idaho with two congressional districts was in 1918.
Beginning with the 2012 election cycle, the district lost nearly all of its Boise precincts to the 2nd district. A significant increase in population directly west of Boise over the previous decade, in western Ada County and Canyon County, was responsible for the westward shift of the boundary. In Ada County, the district continues to include Meridian, Eagle, and some parts of southwest Boise. Northward, all territory remains in the 1st district, through the Panhandle. 
The 1st district is currently represented by Raúl Labrador, a Republican from Eagle. First elected in 2010, he defeated Democratic incumbent Walt Minnick by over nine points and was easily re-elected in 2012.

Sports Club/LA

The Sports Club/LA is a collection of large luxury health clubs located in Los Angeles and in several large city real estate projects in the United States.
History.
Company founders Michael Talla and Nanette Pattee Francini met as teenagers on Spring Break in Mexico in 1969, and later founded a bikini company, Foxy Lady. They went on their own and pursued separate ventures, with Talla founding a raquetball gymnasium and Francini winning the Miss Aspen pageant and becoming a Budweiser girl. Reuniting professionally, the couple opened the first of the company's health clubs in Santa Monica, California as "The Sports Connection", in 1979. The club became popular amongst Hollywood celebrities, and was the inspiration behind the 1985 film, "Perfect". In 1987 they opened the first of several larger clubs called the "Spectrum Club" and Sports Club/LA. They would later sell off the Spectrum and Sports Connection clubs to concentrate on Sports Club/LA. In 1994 the company went public as The Sports Club Co., and in 1995 opened the first of several clubs in New York City, initially called "Reebok Sports Clubs."
In 2006, Sports Club/LA locations outside of Los Angeles were projects purchased by Millennium Partners, one of the company's original investors. That year, Millennium Partners created Millennium Partners Sports Club Management LLC, to operate all of the Sports Club/LA clubs as well as Reebok Sports Club/NY and residential property fitness studios.

<doc id="19848888" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19848888" title="Lea Deutsch">
Lea Deutsch

Lea Deutsch (; 18 March 1927 – May, 1943) was a Croatian Jewish child actress who died during the Holocaust.
Early life.
Lea Dragica Deutsch was born in Zagreb to Croatian Jewish parents, Stjepan and Ivka (née Singer) Deutsch. Their surname was at the time also spelled . Her father was a lawyer, and her mother was an educated housewife, who was actively engaged in chess. She also had a brother, Saša. The Deutsch family lived in Zagreb at Gundulićeva street 39 in a three-story house. Deutsch began acting at the HNK Zagreb at the age of five, playing small roles in professional productions of Molière and Shakespeare. Her mentor and dance teacher was Rod Riffler, a modern dance teacher and choreographer from Zagreb. People were enchanted by her, and she was thought an exceptional talent, a ""Croatian Shirley Temple."" Even the famous Parisian firm Pathé heard of Deutsch and arrived in Zagreb to film a short documentary about her. She quickly rose to become a popular child actor. 
In 1941 NDH began the implementation of race laws which prevented Deutsch from acting. Immediately after the establishment of the NDH she was banned from the theater where she performed and a little later from a school that she attended. Deutsch's schoolmate Relja Bašić recalls, ""She used to sit motionless on a bench across from the theater in a little herringbone pattern coat with a yellow star of David on her sleeves, staring for hours at the building where once she was a star, and now she couldn't even enter the building.""
Arrest, deportation and death.
In an attempt to save his family, Deutsch's father converted his family to Catholicism in June 1941. On May 5, 1943, Heinrich Himmler visited Zagreb. During his visit he pressed NDH leader Ante Pavelić to enact the "Final Solution" in his territory. In the coming days, Croatian and German officials began detaining the heads of the Jewish community in Zagreb and any remaining Jews who had been allowed to stay in the city up until that point.
Members of the national theatre intervened to try to help Deutsch and her family. Actors Tito Strozzi, Vika Podgorska, and Hinko Nučić, and the theatre's attendant Dušan Žanko (himself a member of the Ustaše) all attempted to save Deutsch's life. "Ordinary" people tried to save the Deutsch family. An escape trip to Karlovac was organized for the Deutsch family, where they were supposed to hook up with the partisans, but they had to return to Zagreb because they failed to meet with their "connection." Jewish attempts to transport the Deutsch family to the British Mandate of Palestine also failed. 
In the lower floor of their house, the Deutsch family had at one time a tenant, a young man from Herzegovina, who occasionally wore the Ustaše uniform. In the words of Deutsch's friend Nika Grgić, this young man offered to falsely marry Lea in an attempt to save her from deportation, but that was not done for unknown reasons. Later it was discovered that Deutsch's mother did not want to consent to the wedding, because Lea was still a minor at the time. 
In May 1943, Deutsch, her mother and her brother were deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis. Out of 75 prisoners during the six-day journey in the cattle wagon, without food and water, 25 did not survive. Lea Deutsch was among them, her heart having been weakened by diphtheria in her childhood. Her mother and brother were killed in Auschwitz. Deutsch's father managed to save himself, hiding as a patient who suffered from infectious ocular trachoma at the ward of ophthalmologist Dr. Vilko Panac in the Sisters of Charity Hospital. At that time, it was still naively believed that Jewish women and children would not be touched by the Ustaše and that his family would be safe on their own. Stjepan Deutsch survived the Holocaust and lived until 1959. He was buried in the Jewish part of the Mirogoj Cemetery, with Lea's photo on his tombstone.
Legacy.
In 2003, a Lauder Jewish elementary school in Zagreb was named after her.
In 2010 Croatian director Branko Ivanda made a film ""Lea i Darija - Dječje carstvo,"" about the tragic destiny of Lea Deutsch.

Erik Sørensen

Erik Sørensen, also known by his full name Erik Lykke Sørensen, (born 22 January 1940) is a Danish former association football player and manager. He was a goalkeeper, and played professionally in the 1960s and 1970s for Scottish clubs Greenock Morton and Rangers, and later served as the manager of Morton. He played 15 games for the Denmark national football team from 1963 to 1971.
Career.
Born in Odense, Sørensen made his breakthrough with local top-flight club B1913 in the amateur-only Danish championship. He made his debut for the Danish national team in June 1963, and played five of Denmark's seven games in the successful qualification campaign for the 1964 European Nations' Cup tournament. Before the final tournament, Sørensen signed a professional contract and was banned from the amateur-only national team.
He signed with Scottish team Greenock Morton. Morton manager Hal Stewart had originally wanted to sign another Danish goalkeeper, but was advised to sign Sørensen instead. Sørensen played in a trial game against Third Lanark dressed all in black. Morton refused to name the new player and he was dubbed by the media "The man in black" or "Mr. X". From 1963 to 1967, Sørensen played 102 league games for Morton.
In 1967, he was sold for £25,000 to rival Scottish club Rangers. He played 30 games for Rangers, before returning to Morton in 1970. When the Danish Football Association abolished the rule of amateurism, Sørensen returned to the Danish national team in May 1971, eight years after his debut. He played a further five national team games, including a 1-0 win against Scotland, before ending his international career in June 1971. He left Morton in 1973, having played a total 173 league games for the club.
He eventually became Morton manager for a short time in the mid 70s. He also ran a public house in Greenock after he retired from the game. In the late 1970s he briefly returned to football to play for Danish amateur side Svendborg fB.

Mount Weld

Mount Weld is a mountain and a mine site in Western Australia, located about 30 km south of Laverton and 120 km east of Leonora. It ranks as one of the richest major rare earth deposits in the world.
Rare earths are contained in secondary phosphates and aluminophosphates, presumably derived from weathering of the Proterozoic Mount Weld carbonatite The primary commercial interest at the site is targeted towards oxides as well as further niobium and tantalum deposits within the intrusive pipe of the Mount Weld carbonatite, which is approximately three kilometers in diameter.
The main deposits are hosted within the soil/regolith horizon that blankets the entire carbonatite and form shallow lenses within 60 m of the surface. The most important rare earth oxide deposit, the Central Lanthanide Deposit, CLD, is located at the center of the carbonatite with the niobium/tantalum and other deposits generally located towards outer fringes. Discovered in 1988, the CLD represents a spectacular enrichment of rare earth deposit sediments. The deposit is believed to be the largest and highest grade of its type in the world.
The Mount Weld deposit is owned by ASX-listed Lynas Corporation, which raised A$450 million equity from J. P. Morgan in 2009 to fund the development of a mine and also a processing plant in Kuantan, Malaysia. Once operational, the Mount Weld mine is expected to be the largest source of rare earth elements outside of China.

Georg Ernst Ludwig Hampe (July 5, 1795 – November 23, 1880) was a German pharmacist, botanist and bryologist who was a native of Fürstenberg.
In 1810 he became an apprentice pharmacist to his uncle in Brakel, and over the next fifteen years worked in a number of pharmacies at several locations, including in Halle an der Saale (where he became acquainted with botanist Kurt Sprengel 1766-1833), at the university pharmacy in Göttingen, in the town of Allendorf, and later in the city of Braunschweig. In 1825 he became head of a local pharmacy in Blankenburg am Harz, where he remained its director until 1864.
During his time at Blankenburg, Hampe collected and studied flora native to the Harz Mountains. He was particularly interested in mosses, and through his association with bryologist Karl Müller (1818-1899), he became exposed to non-European species from the Americas, Madagascar, New Zealand, Australia, et al. In his collaborative research with Müller, he described numerous new bryological species.
Later in life, Hampe received an honorary professorship from the University of Göttingen. In 1876 he sold his pharmacy in Blankenburg, and moved to Helmstedt, where he went to live with his son. After Hampe's death, his large herbarium was acquired by the British Museum of Natural History. 
The plant genus "Hampea" from the family Malvaceae was named in his honor by Dietrich von Schlechtendal (1794-1866).

Ratt

Ratt is an American hard rock / heavy metal band that had significant commercial success in the 1980s, with their albums having being certified as gold, platinum, and mutli-platinum by the RIAA. The group is prehaps best known for hit 80s rock singles such as "Round and Round" and "Lay It Down", tracks that ranked on Billboard's top 40 at #12 and #40, respectively, as well as other songs such as "Wanted Man", "Way Cool Jr." and "Lovin' You's A Dirty Job". Ratt has been recognized as instrumental in the formation of the early 1980s Los Angeles glam metal scene, promoting what's known as the 'Sunset Strip' sound of pop hooks infused into an aggressive metal ethos along with groups such as friendly rivals Mötley Crüe.
The band continues to tour and record today despite extended hiatuses and lineup changes. They released their latest studio album, "Infestation", on April 20, 2010. They are currently working on their next studio album.
History.
Early years (1976–1982).
The origins of Ratt go as far back as 1976 with a San Diego band called Mickey Ratt, which was formed by Ratt's founding member, vocalist Stephen Pearcy. Several CDs have been released of the Mickey Ratt line-ups, including several demo compilations and a live concert.
Mickey Ratt went through various line-ups. Members included guitarists Jake E. Lee, Chris Hager, Paul DeNisco, and Bob DeLellis, bassists Matt Thorr, Tim Garcia, and Dave Jellison, Mike New, and drummers John Turner, Seth Faver, and Bob Eisenberg.
In 1980, the band moved to Los Angeles to increase their chances of landing a recording contract with a major label.
The band recorded a single called "Dr. Rock" / "Drivin' on E", which was given to fans at their early Los Angeles club shows.
Guitarist Jake E. Lee joined the Mickey Ratt line up.
In 1981, the band's name was shortened to Ratt. Robbin Crosby played with the band later in the year. Jake E. Lee, Chris Hager, and Matt Thorr all left Ratt to form another band called Rough Cutt. Guitarist Warren DeMartini joined in January 1982 (recommended by Lee). Bassist Gene Hunter (from Jake E. Lee's Teaser) and drummer Khurt Maier (who played drums on the early "Tell the World" recording featured on "Metal Massacre I") would temporarily play in Ratt before the arrival of Bobby Blotzer (ex-Vic Vergeat) and Juan Croucier (previously with Dokken). DeMartini was only 18 years old when he was called up to Los Angeles to join Ratt. At the time he was attending college in San Diego and reluctant to drop out to join a band that had, so far, had only limited success. Marq Torien briefly replaced DeMartini, though Warren returned in time for the recording of their EP, later in 1982.
"Ratt EP" (1983).
In July 1983, Ratt signed with independent Los Angeles recording label Time Coast Records. Later that same year, Time Coast released a 6-track version of the band's debut "Ratt EP" in the United States. Newly formed independent UK label Music For Nations released a 7-track version of the EP in Europe which included the additional track "You're In Trouble".
"Out of the Cellar" (1984).
After a well-received, self-titled independent EP, the band signed with Atlantic Records and immediately started writing and recording what would be its first proper album "Out of the Cellar". Released in March 1984, the breakthrough album was critically praised by both fans and critics alike at the time of its release. Milton Berle's guest appearance, dressed in his Uncle Miltie drag character, in the video for "Round and Round" helped draw even more attention to the band.
"Out of the Cellar" combined the then-prevalent Van Halen and Aerosmith influenced bravado elements with the then-novel muted, staccato guitar-picking style of Judas Priest.
The album scored much radio and MTV play with the blockbuster anthem "Round and Round" (which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100), "Wanted Man", "Back for More", and "Lack of Communication". Pearcy's raspy yet bluesy vocals melded well with the pyrotechnic guitar playing of twin leads Robbin Crosby and Warren DeMartini. Their music videos, especially for that of "Round and Round", exposed them to an excited teen audience first tuning into the then fledgling MTV cable network.
"Out of the Cellar" became a commercial success, going platinum many times over in the United States as well as making them stars in the Far East. The album catapulted the band to the top, capped off by an incredibly successful world tour that saw the band sell out countless stadiums and arenas worldwide. "Out of the Cellar" is today widely regarded as the band's best work and a definitive moment in 80s heavy metal.
Tawny Kitaen, high school sweetheart of Crosby, who'd graced the cover of the band's EP from the previous year, agreed to appear on the cover of their debut full-length album. She also appeared in their video for "Back For More" as the girl in the 1950s skirt at the jukebox.
In 1984 the band toured extensively, sharing the stage with such acts as Billy Squier, Ozzy Osbourne, Blackfoot, Iron Maiden, Mötley Crüe, Twisted Sister and Lita Ford.
"Round and Round" was chosen as No. 61 on VH1's Greatest Hard Rock Songs Show.
"Invasion of Your Privacy" (1985–1986).
The band's second full-length album "Invasion of Your Privacy" was released July 1985.
It peaked at No. 7 (which is the same position that "Out of the Cellar" peaked). The album met mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. Allmusic.com has called it "another batch of solid pop-metal tunes". It contained the favorites "You're in Love" and "Lay It Down" (which made No. 40 on the Hot 100) that assured the band a presence on radio and MTV. Footage from the band's performances at Hirsch Memorial Coliseum in Shreveport, LA and the Mississippi Gulf Coast Coliseum in Biloxi were featured in the video to "You're In Love".
Warren DeMartini & Robbin Crosby's impressive guitar solos and Stephen Pearcy's highly sexual lyrics helped to further define the Ratt sound. Although it did not achieve the sales figures or the status of their debut, "Invasion of Your Privacy" nonetheless was certified double platinum (selling over two million copies) and remains highly regarded amongst fans.
A couple months after the album release, the band released a home video titled "". The video featured the music videos from the Ratt EP, "Out of the Cellar" and "Invasion of Your Privacy". The video is currently out of print and is very rare and difficult to find. The video was the first commercially available video to certify Gold sales status in the USA and eventually reached Platinum.
The model on "Invasion"'s cover is "Playboy" Playmate Marianne Gravatte, who also made an appearance in the "Lay It Down" music video. Using a beautiful female model on an album cover later became a trend copied by many glam metal bands of the 1980s, such as Great White, and Slaughter. Pearcy himself would soon pose for Playgirl (August '86 issue). "Invasion of Your Privacy" was also one of the many albums that received the attention of the PMRC since the cover and the album title were a reference to voyeurism. The Tipper Gore-led organization presented it at a U.S. Congressional hearing on September 19, 1985 dealing with parental advisory labels on albums that display "inappropriate" content.
The band toured extensively in the United States and Japan sharing stage with the likes of Bon Jovi, Ozzy Osbourne and Iron Maiden. In August 1985 the band played on the Monsters Of Rock festival in Donington, England, along with ZZ Top, Bon Jovi, Metallica and Magnum.
"Dancing Undercover" (1986–1987).
Ratt's next release was "Dancing Undercover" in September 1986. The album was a relative disappointment with most music critics at the time of its release. From a commercial standpoint however, the album kept Ratt's string of consecutive Platinum albums alive.This is the first album as well to see Crosby's lead guitar duties minimized in favor of DeMartini.
In an effort to be taken more seriously, Ratt broke from the tradition of featuring a girl on the cover. They instead opted for gritty black-and-white photos of each of the five band members. Likewise, the album does not contain a single power ballad amongst its ten tracks and even features experimental forays into thrashier and heavier sounds.
The song that reflected this most strikingly was "Body Talk", which was featured on the soundtrack for the 1986 Eddie Murphy film "The Golden Child". The more straight-ahead style of the album (especially with this song) lead many fans to believe that Ratt was headed in a direction more akin to the thrash style promulgated by such bands as Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. However, that proved not to be the case as the slightly experimental undertones of the album were quickly replaced with a bluesier sound throughout their next three releases.
Other popular tracks generated by the album included "Dance" and "Slip of the Lip".
Through 1987, Ratt embarked on a U.S. tour with newcomers Poison, and played in Europe as a part of the Monsters Of Rock Tour (widely bootlegged). Their tour with Poison was the 6th highest grossing tour of 1987. Ratt also played Madison Square Garden.
"Reach for the Sky" (1988–1989).
The group's follow-up, "Reach for the Sky" was released in November 1988. Although the album achieved Platinum sales status and reached No. 17 on Billboard's album charts, it was widely panned by critics. Complaints ranged from it being formulaic and sophomoric to the album being uneven and lacking in focus. After this album, the band parted ways with long-time producer Beau Hill. For all the criticisms, "Reach for the Sky" nevertheless contained the popular tracks "Way Cool Jr." and "I Want a Woman" which received some airplay. Those two songs are now regarded as glam metal classics.
The surreal, Dali-esque album cover featured a statue wearing night vision goggles, a human hand emerging from a bundle of twine, a World War II fighter plane, and a wicker chair. The band has remained mum as to what the album cover is supposed to symbolize so as to facilitate the diverse interpretations of their fans. Early pressings of the album cover revealed the breast part of the statue as requested by lead singer Stephen Pearcy. According to Pearcy, he wanted to use that version of the cover but the other band members feared that this would keep the record out of certain music stores. The revised version of the album contained the same tracks, but in a different order. After the revised version hit the record stores, producer Beau Hill stepped down from producer duties and tensions within the band increased.
The band started the new year with a concert at the Tokyo Dome headlined by Bon Jovi The other bands in the bill were Kingdom Come and Britny Fox. Ratt would soon play the Tokyo Dome on their own. Both appearances have been widely bootlegged.
The tour that followed in the spring of '89 (supported by Kix, Warrant and Britny Fox) was eventually cancelled due to poor ticket sales.
"Detonator" (1990–1991).
Ratt's fifth album "Detonator" was released in August 1990. Sir Arthur Payson took over as producer for the band following Beau Hill's departure after the lackluster results for "Reach for the Sky". The album garnered mixed reactions. Critics claimed it lacked the live sounding energy of the band's earlier work, while some claim the sound more akin to "hair metal" (especially when compared to their raw early works) but still showing a band of experienced and refined musicians maturing and striving to expand their sound. "Detonator" featured among its tracks "Shame Shame Shame" and "Lovin' You's A Dirty Job". The band co-wrote most of the album's songs with Desmond Child while Jon Bon Jovi appeared as a guest background vocalist on "Heads I Win, Tails You Lose". Pearcy also co-wrote Givin' Yourself Away with Diane Warren. Detonator's sales were around 800-900,000. Robbin Crosby played on the album (acknowledged in a KNAC interview), despite rumors to the contrary. (Juan Croucier stated on his message board that Crosby's guitar parts are on the disc but were low in the mix.) Plagued by addiction for some time, Crosby authored just one song, "Can't Wait on Love", and contributed notably to another, "All or Nothing". Crosby entered a rehab facility during the early stages of recording.
During the seven shows of the Japanese leg of the 'Detonator' tour in February 1991, Crosby's substance abuse had reached a point where his playing had become increasingly inconsistent onstage. The band had already removed the acoustic intro to Back For More, which Crosby performed, along with modifying sections of other songs that featured Robbin as lead guitarist. During one particular show, after the band performed two songs using non-standard tunings, Crosby did not properly switch out guitars with his guitar technician. As a result, he was not in tune with the band for the next two songs. The last show of the Japanese tour, in Osaka, would be Robbin's last with Ratt. He would not record or perform with the band again.
When the band returned to the United States, Robbin checked into a rehab facility and Ratt continued on with Michael Schenker, formerly of Scorpions, UFO, Michael Schenker Group, and McAuley Schenker Group.
"MTV Unplugged", "Nobody Rides for Free" and "Ratt n' Roll 81–91" (1991–1992).
Ratt was featured on the first season of MTV Unplugged to promote their most current album and new single, sharing the stage with all-female rock band Vixen. Michael Schenker was still performing with Ratt at the time of this taping.
At the end of 1991, Ratt released the final single of their career, "Nobody Rides for Free" which appeared on "Point Break'"s soundtrack album. The song and video clearly signal a change in the band. Robbin did not participate in the recording of the song and was not present for the shooting of the video in which only the four remaining members appeared.
The band never again recorded or performed with the original five members.
Atlantic Records released a greatest hits compilation entitled "Ratt & Roll 81-91" in September 1991. The album featured five songs from "Detonator", more than any other album featured on the compilation. It also featured the aforementioned song "Nobody Rides For Free". This greatest hits compilation achieved Gold sales status.
Ratt "disbanded" or "on hiatus" (1992–1996).
In February 1992, Stephen Pearcy exited the group to form a new hard rock band, with former Cinderella drummer Fred Coury called Arcade, before moving on to VD in '95 and the industrial-tinged Vertex in '96.
Robbin Crosby started Secret Service, which included bassist Krys Baratto (Samantha 7, Juice 13). In 1993, Crosby performed on Rumbledog's self-titled debut album.
Warren DeMartini (who had left after Pearcy in '92) was in Whitesnake in 1994 and issued two solo releases: a single, 1995s "Surf's Up!", and a full length, 1996's "Crazy Enough to Sing to You".
Bobby Blotzer and Juan Croucier both started to live more normal lives outside the public eye and the two of them became producers for underground bands.
Juan Croucier ran a recording studio called 'The Cellar', and, in 1994, received a lifetime achievement award in Los Angeles (Crosby was there). During that year, Robbin Crosby was diagnosed with HIV, which later developed into AIDS.
First reunion and self-titled album (1996–2000).
In 1996, the five classic era members of Ratt began discussing a reunion and a subsequent album after their publishing had to be renewed.
After meeting with Robbin, it was decided that he was not in any physical shape to record or perform with the band. As the talks continued to progress, bassist Juan Croucier made the decision not to participate in the reunion as well. Rudy Sarzo was first thought as a replacement but would end up rejoining Quiet Riot. Ratt eventually moved forward with Pearcy, DeMartini and Blotzer, along with new member, Robbie Crane (formerly of Vince Neil's solo band and Pearcy's Vertex tour) on bass. The band issued a compilation album called "Collage" in July 1997, which consisted of B-sides, alternate recordings, and new versions of songs from the Mickey Ratt period. In 1998, Ratt secured a worldwide record deal with Sony. The 1999 self-titled "Ratt" album featured new material with a more conventional blues rock feel.
With A&R guru John Kalodner in control over how the album turned out, bringing in outside writers in the process, the album didn't come close to the platinum success that Ratt typically achieved, though the album's first single, "Over The Edge", did graze the Top 40 Mainstream Rock charts.
Two versions of Ratt, Death of Crosby and new era (2000–2006).
After this, Ratt added Keri Kelli as a second guitarist. In 2000, Pearcy left the group again, going on tour as Nitronic, and soon after, as 'Ratt Featuring Stephen Pearcy'. His record label Top Fuel Records released some archived Ratt material and Pearcy solo work.
Meanwhile, DeMartini and Blotzer would carry on their version of Ratt replacing Pearcy briefly with singer Robert Mason who would demo with the band. He would play a showcase for Portrait Records before he and Kelli both left. Jizzy Pearl and guitarist John Corabi ended up replacing Mason and Kelli. After a legal battle, the Demartini/Blotzer version would eventually win the rights to tour as 'Ratt'.
In 2001, former guitarist Robbin Crosby publicly announced that he was HIV positive. He died on June 6, 2002 from a heroin overdose. He was 42 years old.
For the next two years, they would be featured in the "Rock Never Stops Tour" alongside other 1980s hard rock/heavy metal bands. In 2001, Pearcy attempted to sue the band for touring under the "Ratt" name, but lost. Pearcy then toured as 'Stephen Pearcy' and occasionally nicknamed his solo band the Rat Bastards.
On January 7, 2005 Juan Croucier explained to a fan, on his website message board, how Blotzer and Croucier decided to put the band to rest back in 1992 after Pearcy and DeMartini left the group. With this message, Croucier became the first member of Ratt to explain the events that ensued following the breakup in 1992. Corroborating previous interviews given by band members (including Pearcy, Blotzer, and DeMartini) that they did disband in 1992.
On May 11, 2006, Ratt was profiled on VH1's "Behind the Music". In the episode, it was revealed for the first time publicly that former guitarist Robbin Crosby died of a heroin overdose, and not AIDS-related complications as was sometimes erroneously reported.
During the group's inactive years, present-day and former members continued to work on their own side projects. Blotzer, Corabi, and Crane joined forces with Keri Kelli in the classic rock cover band named "Angel City Outlaws". Warren DeMartini and Jizzy Pearl worked on their respective solo careers and continued to record new material. In a surprising turn of events, Juan Croucier and Stephen Pearcy toured with one another during the summer and fall of 2006. Even further surprising many, Blotzer joined them onstage at a show on October 27, 2006.
Second reunion (2006–2008).
On December 1, 2006 the website "Metal Sludge" generated a large number of rumors after reporting that Pearcy and Croucier would re-unite with Blotzer and DeMartini. On December 4, 2006, Jizzy Pearl announced on his message board that he was no longer a member of the band, further increasing speculation and excitement. On March 17, 2007 another website stated that Ratt would go on the 2007 tour with Poison and Great White. On April 12, Bravewords reported that White Lion would open for Poison and Ratt, while Great White was still 'in talks' to join the tour.
On March 20, 2007, the official Ratt website was finally updated with only the band's logo after a year and a half of being dormant. One week later, Blabbermouth.com reported that Ratt would take part in the "Rocklahoma" festival on July 13–15, 2007 in Pryor, Oklahoma, with original singer Stephen Pearcy and without Juan Croucier, who decided not to participate in the reunion tour. Robbie Crane continued to play bass instead.
Tramp's White Lion was removed from the tour due to legal issues, and Vains of Jenna took their place. The summer tour started June 13, 2007 at the Bi Lo Center in Greenville, S.C., and ended August 19, 2007 at the Coors Amphitheatre in Denver. The tour, which brought Poison and Ratt onstage together for the first time since 1999, visited amphitheaters, festivals and fairs in such cities as Boston, Detroit, New York, New Jersey and Los Angeles.
Festivals the tour performed at include Birmingham, Ala.'s City Stages (June 16), Bay City, Mich.'s Bay City River Roar (June 22), Pryor, Okla.'s Rocklahoma (July 13), Sturgis, S.D.'s Buffalo Chip (August 5) and Newton, IA, Iowa Speedway (August 4).
On July 31, 2007, Ratt released a DVD entitled "" which chronicle the band's video history. On August 21, 2007, they also released a best-of CD entitled "."
In November 2007, Ratt toured Japan and Australia, the Australian leg featuring Winger as support act. Throughout October the band was to tour Europe, but instead, the band planned to return in June 2008 to perform at some of Europe's most popular rock festivals including Spring and Airbrake as well as several other key dates in the UK and Scandinavia. At the end of January 2008 they played at Motley Cruise, a 4-day cruise in the Caribbean (Miami, Key West and Cozumel, MX) with Vince Neil, Skid Row, Slaughter, Endeverafter, and Lynam.
In May and June 2008, Ratt toured Europe. On June 5, 2008, they were supported by local Leeds band's King Nothing and Slash Vegas at the legendary rock club Rio's.
In August 2008, Sirius Satellite Radio's Hair Nation channel reported that former Mötley Crüe singer John Corabi had resigned as rhythm guitarist for Ratt and was rumored to be replaced by former Quiet Riot guitarist Carlos Cavazo. Bobby Blotzer confirmed these rumors stating that Cavazo was set to replace Corabi and would make his debut with the band on August 27. His first show with Ratt was in Baton Rouge, LA.
"Infestation" and hiatus (2009–2011).
Ratt joined a variety of other hard rock acts on the November 2009 cruise entitled "ShipRocked". In April 2009 Loud & Proud/Roadrunner Records announced the signing of a worldwide deal with Ratt. Their new album, "Infestation", was released in April 2010. Infestation reached No. 30 on Billboard's Top 200 chart. A video for the first single titled "Best of Me" was filmed. A world tour in support of "Infestation" followed. "Infestation" also marked something of a return to Atlantic, as Roadrunner has been owned by Atlantic since 2006.
In a March 18, 2010 interview with Metalholic Magazine, guitarist/founder, Warren DeMartini said of the new album, "Infestation"; "It really exceeded our expectations. Conceptually we kinda wanted to revisit the period of Out Of The Cellar and Invasion Of Your Privacy. We were sort of loosely trying to shoot for something that could fit between those two records. We were looking for more uptempo ideas and the double leads that Robbin Crosby and I started doing back in 1983." 
RATT were confirmed to play the main stage at the Download Festival 2010 at Donnington Park, UK in June 2010. However, on June 8, 2010, it was announced on Download Festival's website that RATT had pulled out of the festival due to surgery of one of the band members.
On October 26, 2010, it was announced Ratt would be going into an indefinite hiatus after tensions within the band reared their head. It was left uncertain whether Ratt would disband permanently, but bassist Robbie Crane, confirmed that following the end of the band's tour supporting the album "Infestation", the band were on an indefinite hiatus. He also confirmed that all members were busy with their own projects: him touring with Lynch Mob, frontman Stephen Pearcy touring with his solo band, Warren DeMartini touring with his and Dee Snider's Christmas band, and Carlos Cavazo and Bobby Blotzer working on a project together. It was also rumoured that bassist Robbie Crane would not be returning to Ratt if they chose to reunite. On October 27, 2010, vocalist Stephen Pearcy said that Ratt would be on hiatus "for a while.". However, he later confirmed that a RATT tour would be possible in 2012 after his other commitments. During his time as guest guitarist on "That Metal Show", Warren DeMartini said that the band were in the talking stages of getting back to writing in the winter.
Reunion with Croucier and new album (2012–present).
In January 2012, singer Stephen Pearcy said that Ratt was in the process of writing material for a new album, planned to be released that summer. Also that month, it was announced that Ratt will be playing at the M3 Rock Festival in the summer of 2012. On March 22, bassist Robbie Crane announced his departure from Ratt to focus on Lynch Mob. In April 2012, rumors arose that original bassist Juan Croucier would rejoin the band that summer; these rumors were confirmed when Croucier played with Ratt at the M3 festival on May 12.
In January 2013, drummer Bobby Blotzer said that, with songwriting completed, pre-production of the band's next album would begin in the near future with Brian Howes producing.
Musical style.
Ratt's music is influenced by 1970s hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Aerosmith, Sweet, Van Halen, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, Scorpions and KISS. They fused this style with NWOBHM influences, including Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Blink-182, Jimmy Eat World, Fall Out Boy all view Ratt as an influence. 
Although they later incorporated more of a blues-rock sound into their music, the band was one of the first glam metal style groups that appeared in the early 1980s in California. Their image bore similarities to that of Rough Cutt, which had several members who were previously in Mickey Ratt (from which Ratt evolved).

Stryper

Stryper is a Christian glam metal band from Orange County, California. The group's lineup consists of Michael Sweet (lead vocals, guitar), Oz Fox (guitar), Tim Gaines (bass guitar), and Robert Sweet (drums). In 2004, Gaines left the band and was replaced by Tracy Ferrie (bass guitar) but rejoined in 2009.
Formed in 1983 as Roxx Regime, the band soon changed their musical message to reflect their Christian beliefs, and the band's name was also changed to Stryper. They went on to become the first overtly Christian heavy metal band to gain acceptance in the mainstream. In 1983, they signed with major label Enigma Records and released their debut album "The Yellow and Black Attack". In the mid-1980s, Stryper enjoyed their most successful period beginning with the release of "To Hell with the Devil", which achieved platinum sales status. Stryper went on to release two more gold albums before breaking up in 1992. In 2003, Stryper came out of retirement for a reunion tour and subsequently signed a multi-album contract with Big3 Records in 2005. In 2013 they signed a multi-album deal with Frontiers Records, and have released an EP, "Second Coming", which includes 14 re-recorded songs from their first three albums and an album, "No More Hell to Pay", released on November 5, 2013.
Origin of name.
The name "Stryper" derives from the King James Version of the Bible. "But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities:
the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed." The reference, Isaiah 53:5, is frequently included as part of their logo. Stryper's drummer, Robert Sweet, also created a backronym for their name: "salvation through redemption, yielding peace, encouragement and righteousness".
History.
Foundation and mainstream success (1975-1990).
The Sweet brothers became Christians in 1975, but began to pull away from this faith. The Sweet brothers rejoined the church after their friend Kenny Metcalf (their first tour keyboardist) persuaded them to do so.
Inspired by bands such as Van Halen, but distressed by their message, they sought to form a band that would extol their worldview and beliefs. Stryper was originally known as Roxx Regime and composed of brothers Michael Sweet on lead vocals and lead guitar and Robert Sweet on drums. Eric Johnson played bass. They were originally a trio. Oz Fox eventually joined the band. Before Oz Fox joined the band, a number of guitarists almost joined Roxx Regime, including Doug Aldrich and C.C. DeVille. The name "Stryper" was adopted when bassist Tim Gaines joined the band and the label urged the band to change its name. The Bible scripture, from a passage in Isaiah 53:5, "By His stripes we are healed" became part of the band's logo. Shortly afterward, they released the EP "The Yellow and Black Attack" on July 21, 1984. During this period, Stryper opened for bands like Ratt and Bon Jovi, leading some fans and critics to claim that they were not a true Christian band. Stryper's first full-length album, "Soldiers Under Command", released on May 15, 1985, was the band's first gold record. Capitalizing on this unexpected success, and in an attempt to make up for the EP's extremely limited release (fewer than 200,000 copies), their record label, Enigma, re-released "The Yellow and Black Attack" on August 10, 1986 with two new tracks and new cover art.
Stryper's third album, "To Hell with the Devil", was released on October 24, 1986 and went platinum after spending three months on "Billboard"'s album charts, eventually selling more than 2 million copies. In addition to being Stryper's most successful record, it was both the first contemporary Christian music and Christian metal album to achieve this feat. "Calling on You", "Free" and "Honestly" were hugely popular MTV hits in 1987—so much so, that "Free" and "Honestly" both became most-requested songs on the show "Dial MTV". They were also the second Christian band to get any airplay on MTV, Degarmo & Key having been the first with their song "666." "Honestly" is Stryper's highest-charting song, peaking at No. 23 on the Top 40 charts. The album received a Grammy Award nomination. Michael Sweet is the band's primary songwriter and has written most of the band's material throughout the years. He is also currently the band's producer.
Bassist Tim Gaines did not participate in the recording of "To Hell with the Devil", and for a short period of time prior to the release of the record he was replaced by Matt Hurich. Hurich was not with the band more than a month, although he was outfitted with a yellow and black striped bass and a racing costume. Brad Cobb played bass on the album. However, when the promotional photos for the album were being shot, Gaines returned to the band and subsequently participated in its successful world tour. In 1987 the band headlined the Dynamo Open Air Festival in the Netherlands. There is one "To Hell with the Devil" promotional photo of the band with Matt Hurich that was used in print advertisements. Prior to his time in Stryper, Hurich was in Leatherwolf. In 1989 he performed with his Stryper bass in the group Divine Right, which featured Kevin Brandow (Petra) on lead vocals and guitar.
In the summer of 1986, Kenny Metcalf left touring with Stryper and Brent Jeffers replaced Kenny Metcalf on keyboards and toured with Stryper until 1990.
Their next album, "In God We Trust", released on June 28, 1988, also went gold, and the song "Always There for You" briefly entered the lower levels of the pop charts, peaking at No. 71 despite it being another massive hit on MTV. However, the sound of the album was more pop-oriented than previous releases and a number of critics, as well as Stryper fans, criticized the record for being over-produced. In addition, the image of the band was moving even closer to the glam metal look of the era, giving fans something else to criticize. These factors led to lower sales, and the album spent only five weeks charting on Billboard. The second single and video, "I Believe in You", peaked at No. 88 and a third single "Keep the Fire Burning" failed to chart at all. As with the previous album, Tim Gaines did not participate in the recording (Brad Cobb once again played bass) but later rejoined the group for another world tour. "In God We Trust" also garnered two GMA Dove Awards for "Hard Music Album" and "Hard Music Song" for the title track.
Decline, break-up and solo projects (1990-1999).
On August 21, 1990, Stryper released the controversial album "Against the Law", which drastically changed the band's image and lyrical message. While their earlier albums all had yellow and black colors in the covers and the lyrics spoke of God and salvation, "Against the Law" featured the band with black leather clothes and with no mention of the word "God" in the lyrics at all. The band's musical sound was also heavier, closer to classic metal. Drummer Robert Sweet said that the change of image and sound was in response to the criticism of the previous album and an attempt to leave behind their glam metal image. The album sold poorly. This was partly due to rumors in the press (both mainstream and Christian) that Stryper's music was trending towards a more mainstream sound as their Christian faith weakened. Fans wondered why they covered the 1975 Earth Wind & Fire's "Shining Star". The video for it would not be a hit on MTV, the first Stryper video that was not. Two other videos followed for "Two Time Woman" and "Lady" which generated minimal airplay. However, many critics still considered the album to be Stryper's best musical production to date.
On July 20, 1991, after being signed to Hollywood Records, Stryper released a greatest hits collection called "Can't Stop the Rock", which featured two new songs. One of which was the Gulf War inspired "Believe". The band continued to tour until February 1992, when frontman Michael Sweet departed the band citing artistic differences and to pursue a solo career.
Stryper continued as a trio for several European dates. Sometime during this period while touring with the Christian band Bride, Dale Thompson filled in at vocals. It was during one of the concerts that Robert Sweet unexpectedly announced that Bride's frontman Dale Thompson was going to be their new lead singer. This, however, was later denied by Thompson. Upon returning to the United States, the remaining members decided to go their separate ways and were never able to recapture success without Michael Sweet.
Michael Sweet signed with Benson Records in 1993 and released his first solo effort in 1994. It went on to sell 250,000 units, achieve five No. 1 Christian CHR hit singles and three No. 1 rock singles. Michael Sweet has released multiple solo records which were hugely successful in the Christian music market.
Oz Fox and Tim Gaines formed their own band, SinDizzy, and released the album "He's Not Dead" in 1998. Drummer Robert Sweet played in several bands, among them Blissed, who released an album in 2002. Other bands include King James, dbeality, Final Axe, and The Seventh Power.
Reunion and "Reborn" (1999-2005).
The former members of Stryper first reunited in 1999, when Michael Sweet and SinDizzy were invited to play at a summer rock festival in Puerto Rico. As an encore, Sweet joined Oz Fox and Tim Gaines on stage and played several Stryper songs. Later, in 2000, the first "Stryper Expo" was held in New Jersey, and for the first time in 8 years the complete line-up of Stryper took the stage. That same year, a concert was held in Costa Rica at which the four members played together. A second "Stryper Expo" took place in Los Angeles in 2001.
Hollywood Records asked the former members of Stryper to record tracks for a new greatest hits compilation in 2003 '. The compilation was released with two new songs, "Something" and "For You", marking Stryper's first new music since the early 1990s. A tour followed in support. The band played 36 shows in the United States and finished the tour in San Juan, Puerto Rico. A live album, titled ', was released the following year, and the concert in Puerto Rico was filmed for a live DVD produced and directed by Jack Edward Sawyers. However, that show in Puerto Rico proved to be the last for the original line-up of Stryper. Gaines and the band parted ways in 2004 before they were slated to play Disney's Night of Joy in Orlando. Michael's bassist on his previous solo tours, Tracy Ferrie, replaced him.
After the "Night of Joy" show and with new found energy, Stryper decided to go back into the studio to record a new CD, "Reborn" and another tour followed in the fall of 2004.
Stryper's next album, "Reborn", was released on August 16, 2005, and was the band's first full-length CD of original material in 15 years. It was produced by Michael Sweet. The new album received a positive response from fans and critics, some of whom labeled "Reborn" as one of the best albums of that year. With a more modern sound incorporating aspects of alternative rock and grunge, along with fewer guitar solos, the new record updates their style while keeping the Stryper identity. The record was written by Michael Sweet. The lyrics also have returned to the band's familiar themes of God and salvation.
In 2006, the band released the DVD "Greatest Hits: Live in Puerto Rico" with Music Video Distributors. Stryper was scheduled to open for extreme thrash metal band Slayer, headlining in Mexico. A few months later, Slayer pulled out of the Mexican tour and cancelled their headline for personal reasons.
"Murder by Pride" (2006-2010).
In November 2006, Stryper announced new management. They also announced a follow-up to "Reborn" tentatively due in spring/summer 2007. However, that February saw lead singer Michael Sweet postponing the release of the new album two days before its recording was to begin. Sweet's wife Kyle had been diagnosed with stage four ovarian cancer, and the new album was put on hold so that he could care for his family and ailing wife. She underwent surgery and treatment from February 14 to July 14. In April 2008, Kyle announced that her cancer had returned as of October 2007. The new album was in the mixing stage as of January 2008, and Sweet said that it should be released in July or August.
Michael Sweet performed with the band Boston in 2007 and was asked to join the band as co-lead vocalist and guitarist and toured with Boston in 2008 with Styx as the opening act.
On March 5, 2009, Michael Sweet's wife, Kyle, died from cancer. "Murder by Pride" was released on July 21, 2009; with the lead single "Peace of Mind" preceding it.
Since late 2008, Tim Gaines has played bass in concert with Tourniquet. The band has since added the song "To Hell With The Devil" to their set list to highlight Tim's involvement. Recently, Oz Fox joined Tourniquet on stage in Germany to perform the same song.
"The Covering" (2011).
It was announced on July 13, 2010, that "The Covering" would be the name of Stryper's latest album, tentatively scheduled for release October 13 from Big3 Records/Sony. The album, produced by Michael Sweet, is a collection of twelve cover songs from bands that inspired Stryper and helped to shape the band's sound and musical identity, including past hits from Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, Kansas and many others. "The Covering" also includes "God", a new original recording. On September 14, 2010, it was announced that the album's first single, a cover of Black Sabbath's hit "Heaven and Hell", was available for download on iTunes. The album was released on February 15, 2011.
"Second Coming" and "No More Hell to Pay" (2013).
The band signed a deal with Frontiers Records and released a new album on March 26 titled "Second Coming". The album features fourteen classic songs re-recorded as well as two new songs. Stryper began work on their new all original studio album in January 2013. The album, "No More Hell to Pay", was completed on May 29, 2013 and was released on November 5, through Frontiers Records.
Music and image.
During the 1980s, Stryper represented the popular glam metal style for the time which is characterized by highly visual performances, twin guitar solos, Michael Sweet's high-pitched, multi-octave screams and big hair. A trademark of the band's stage act was drummer Robert Sweet's practice of turning his enormous drum kit sideways to the audience so that the crowd could see him playing. This is why Robert was more often called a "visual timekeeper" rather than a drummer. A characteristic element of the band was that all their outfits, sets, and instruments were painted in yellow and black stripes. The number of the stripes represented in various stage props and costumes increased during the show, leading up to "In God We Trust". The band explained the symbolism of the stripes: a direct reference to the whiplash scourges given by Pontius Pilate to Jesus, derived from the King James Version of the Bible's Isaiah 53:5.
Apart from its ubiquitous yellow and black stripes, Stryper had other distinctive trademarks. During concerts, Stryper threw Bibles to the concert crowd—specifically editions of the New Testament with the band's logo stickers affixed to them. As a protest against "666" symbols popular among many heavy metal fans of the era, Stryper promoted an alternative numerological symbol; Stryper's trademark use of the "777" symbol subsequently became quite popular among Christian metalheads. Although the number "777" is not actually referenced by the Bible (as opposed to 666, which is famously mentioned in The Book of Revelation as The Number of the Beast) the number "7" is traditionally (in Christian symbolism) associated with divine perfection. Some of the band's stage sets included the crossed out symbols of "devil" and "666".
The "Los Angeles Times" reported in 1985 that "the band gets sullen fans of Twisted Sister cheering and poking stubby 'one way' fingers heavenward—a refutation of the double-fingered 'devil horns' salute of many metal groups".
Legacy.
Stryper is recognized as the first openly Christian heavy metal band to gain recognition in the mainstream music world. Their message of salvation has also made them popular with some elements of the media. Mark Joseph states ""The Yellow and Black Attack" was propelled by the group's success in Japan, which was largely due to an endorsement of the band by famed rock critic Masa Itoh, the man who ruled the Japanese hard rock/metal scene, who many fans looked to for his evaluation of bands. Itoh had heard of Stryper, gotten in touch with their manager Daryn Hinton, and liked what he heard. When he gave the band a positive review in Japan's heavy metal bible "Burrn!" magazine and played the album on his radio show, Stryper suddenly found themselves at the top of the metal heap in Japan with a record that was outselling Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi, and every other metal band."
This led to the band signing with CBS Sony in Japan.
Stryper has not been free of controversy. Many Christian critics did not approve of the group's association with the heavy metal subculture, which has often been associated with Satanic imagery. Other Christian detractors viewed the band's flashy costumes as incongruous with the modesty in dress often associated with sincere practitioners of devout Christianity. Televangelist Jimmy Swaggart was a particularly prominent critic, likening Stryper's practice of distributing the New Testament at their shows to "casting pearls before swine". A 1985 CCM magazine article by Chris Willman, who was also writing for the Los Angeles Times, stated that "Stryper was the target of scattered picketing, boycott threats, and righteous denunciations". For example, concert-goers were often greeted by protesters armed with bullhorns and distribution of Gospel tracts. "It was just like if Ozzy Osbourne was there. They gave us the same treatment, laughs Daryn Hinton."
In 1990, "Rolling Stone" magazine reported that the band had become disillusioned with Christian music. This, combined with a notable shift in tone in the band's lyrics, led to "Against the Law" being banned from many Christian bookstores. The Benson Company, Stryper's sole tie to the Christian market, dropped this album from distribution. Swaggart's condemnation may not have been a surprise, however, as Stryper was supported by the rival Jim Bakker ministries, who are thanked on several Stryper albums.
Stryper has sold over 10 million recordings worldwide, and it is estimated that two-thirds of their albums were bought by non-Christians. 2011 Stryper won the readers choice award for Best Christian / Gospel Artists & Bands. Kim Jones of About.com states "With 44% of the vote, hard rock legends Stryper beat out all of their competition to be named the Best Christian Hard Rock Band, bringing to mind the old adage, 'like a fine wine, some things just get better with age.'"
Ian Christe, author of the heavy metal history book "Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal", mentions the album "To Hell with the Devil" in his book as one of the landmarks of the glam metal movement.
The song "To Hell with the Devil" appears on the Rhino Records release "The Heavy Metal Box", a compilation mainly of secular Classic Metal bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Metallica, as well as hair bands like Twisted Sister and Poison.
In popular culture.
The Marvel comic series "Runaways" refers to Stryper as being a Christian glam band in Vol. 4 "True Believers".
UK band Half Man Half Biscuit refer to Stryper in the chorus of their song "Christian Rock Concert" from the 1991 album "McIntyre, Treadmore and Davitt".
In the 2009 film "Whip It," Ellen Page's character "Bliss" distinctively wears a Stryper t-shirt throughout the film, which originally belonged to her mother, Marcia Gay Harden's character, and is referred to by the daughter as "the only cool thing, that you own".
On the Bloodhound Gang song "Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)" on "One Fierce Beer Coaster" the lyric "Or do you own a record by Stryper?" is a part of a list of reasons for doing what the title of the song suggests.
In the 2013 film "Pain & Gain", Dwayne Johnson's character, while at a gun shop, pretends to be doing security work for the band in order to have access to select weaponry available only to law enforcement.

Discontinuous gas exchange

Discontinuous gas-exchange cycles (DGC), also called discontinuous ventilation or discontinuous ventilatory cycles, follow one of several patterns of arthropod gas exchange that have been documented primarily in insects; they occur when the insect is at rest. During DGC, oxygen (O2) uptake and carbon dioxide (CO2) release from the whole insect follow a cyclical pattern characterized by periods of little to no release of CO2 to the external environment. Discontinuous gas exchange is traditionally defined in three phases, whose names reflect the behaviour of the spiracles: the closed phase, the flutter phase, and the open phase.
Until recently, insect respiration was believed to occur entirely by simple diffusion. It was believed that air entered the tracheae through the spiracles, and diffused through the tracheal system to the tracheoles, whereupon O2 was delivered to the cells. However, even at rest, insects show a wide variety of gas exchange patterns, ranging from largely diffusive continuous ventilation, to cyclic respiration, of which discontinuous gas exchange cycles are the most striking.
Discontinuous gas exchange cycles have been described in over 50 insect species, most of which are large beetles (order Coleoptera) or butterflies or moths (order Lepidoptera). As the cycles have evolved more than once within the insects, discontinuous gas exchange cycles are likely adaptive, but the mechanisms and significance of their evolution are currently under debate.
Phases.
Discontinuous gas exchange cycles are characterized by a repeating pattern of three phases. These phases are named according to the behaviour of the spiracles and are most commonly identified by their CO2 output, primarily observed using open flow respirometry.
Closed phase.
During the closed phase of discontinuous gas exchange cycles, the spiracle muscles contract, causing the spiracles to shut tight. At the initiation of the closed phase, the partial pressure of both O2 and CO2 is close to that of the external environment, but closure of the spiracles drastically reduces the capacity for the exchange of gases with the external environment. Independent of cycles of insect ventilation which may be discontinuous, cellular respiration on a whole animal level continues at a constant rate. As O2 is consumed, its partial pressure decreases within the tracheal system. In contrast, as CO2 is produced by the cells, it is buffered in the haemolymph rather than being exported to the tracheal system. This mismatch between O2 consumption and CO2 production within the tracheal system leads to a negative pressure inside the system relative to the external environment. Once the partial pressure of O2 in the tracheal system drops below a lower limit, activity in the nervous system causes the initiation of the flutter phase.
Flutter phase.
During the flutter phase of discontinuous gas exchange cycles, spiracles open slightly and close in rapid succession. As a result of the negative pressure within the tracheal system, created during the closed phase, a small amount of air from the environment enters the respiratory system each time the spiracles are opened. However, the negative internal pressure also prevents the liberation of CO2 from the haemolymph and its exportation through the tracheal system. As a result, during the flutter phase, additional O2 from the environment is acquired to satisfy cellular O2 demand, while little to no CO2 is released. The flutter phase may continue even after tracheal pressure is equal to that of the environment, and the acquisition of O2 may be assisted in some insects by active ventilatory movements such as contraction of the abdomen. The flutter phase continues until CO2 production surpasses the buffering capacity of the haemolymph and begins to build up within the tracheal system. CO2 within the tracheal system has both a direct (acting on the muscle tissue) and indirect (through the nervous system) impact on the spiracle muscles and they are opened widely, initiating the open phase.
Open phase.
A rapid release of CO2 to the environment characterizes the open phase of discontinuous gas exchange cycles. During the open phase, spiracular muscles relax and the spiracles open completely. The open phase may initiate a single, rapid release of CO2, or several spikes declining in amplitude with time as a result of the repeated opening and closing of the spiracles. During the open phase, a complete exchange of gases with the environment occurs entirely by diffusion in some species, but may be assisted by active ventilatory movements in others.
Variability in discontinuous gas exchange cycles.
The great variation in insect respiratory cycles can largely be explained by differences in spiracle function, body size and metabolic rate. Gas exchange may occur through a single open spiracle, or the coordination of several spiracles. Spiracle function is controlled almost entirely by the nervous system. In most insects that demonstrate discontinuous gas exchange, spiracle movements and active ventilation are closely coordinated by the nervous system to generate unidirectional air flow within the tracheal system. This coordination leads to the highly regulated bursting pattern of CO2 release. Building CO2 levels during the flutter phase may either directly affect spiracular opening, affect the nervous system while being pumped through the haemolymph, or both. However, the effects of CO2 on both spiracles and the nervous system do not appear to be related to changes in pH.
Variability in discontinuous gas exchange cycles is also dependent upon external stimuli such as temperature and the partial pressure of O2 and CO2 in the external environment. Environmental stimuli may affect one or more aspects of discontinuous cycling, such as cycle frequency and the quantity of CO2 released at each burst. Temperature can have massive effects on the metabolic rate of ectothermic animals, and changes in metabolic rate can create large differences in discontinuous gas exchange cycles. At a species-specific low temperature discontinuous gas exchange cycles are known to cease entirely, as muscle function is lost and spiracles relax and open. The temperature at which muscular function is lost is known as the chill coma temperature.
Discontinuous gas exchange cycles vary widely among different species of insects, and these differences have been used in the past to support or refute hypotheses of the evolution of respiratory cycling in insects.
Evolution of discontinuous gas exchange cycles.
Despite being well described, the mechanisms responsible for the evolution of discontinuous gas exchange cycles are largely unknown. Discontinuous gas exchange cycles have long been thought to be an adaptation to conserve water when living in a terrestrial environment (the hygric hypothesis). However, recent studies question the hygric hypothesis, and several alternative hypotheses have been proposed. For discontinuous gas exchange cycles to be considered adaptive, the origin and subsequent persistence of the trait must be demonstrated to be a result of natural selection.
Hygric hypothesis.
The hygric hypothesis was first proposed in 1953, making it the earliest posed hypothesis for the evolution of discontinuous gas exchange. The hygric hypothesis proposes that the discontinuous release of CO2 is an adaptation that allows terrestrial insects to limit respiratory water loss to the environment. This hypothesis is supported by studies that have demonstrated that respiratory water loss is substantially higher in insects forced to keep their spiracles open, than those of the same species who exhibit discontinuous gas exchange. In addition, laboratory selection experiments on "Drosophila melanogaster" have shown that more variable gas exchange patterns can emerge in populations of insects artificially selected for tolerance to dry conditions. However, water loss during discontinuous gas exchange is only limited during the flutter phase if gas exchange during the flutter phase is convective (or assisted by muscular contraction). From a water conservation perspective, if ventilation during the flutter phase occurs entirely by simple diffusion, there is no benefit to having a flutter phase. This has led to the belief that some other factor may have contributed to the evolution of discontinuous gas exchange in insects.
Chthonic and chthonic-hygric hypotheses.
Following work on harvester ants in 1995, doctors John Lighton and David Berrigan proposed the chthonic hypothesis. It was observed that many insects that demonstrate discontinuous gas exchange cycles are exposed to hypoxia (low O2 levels) and hypercapnia (high CO2 levels) by spending at least part of their life cycle in enclosed spaces underground. Lighton and Berrigan hypothesized that discontinuous gas exchange cycles may be an adaptation to maximize partial pressure gradients between an insect’s respiratory system and the environment in which it lives. Alternatively, insects could obtain enough O2 by opening their spiracles for extended periods of time. However, unless their environment is very humid, water will be lost from the respiratory system to the environment. Discontinuous gas exchange cycles, therefore, may limit water loss while facilitating O2 consumption and CO2 removal in such environments. Many researchers describe this theory as the chthonic-hygric hypothesis and consider it to support the hygric hypothesis. However, others emphasize the importance of maximizing partial pressure gradients alone and consider the chthonic hypothesis to be distinct from the hygric hypothesis.
Oxidative damage hypothesis.
The oxidative damage hypothesis states that discontinuous gas exchange cycles are an adaptation to reduce the amount of O2 delivered to tissues under periods of low metabolic rate. During the open phase, O2 partial pressure in the tracheal system reaches levels near that of the external environment. However, over time during the closed phase the partial pressure of O2 drops, limiting the overall exposure of tissues to O2 over time. This would lead to the expectation of prolonged flutter periods in insects that may be particularly sensitive to high levels of O2 within the body. Strangely however, termites that carry a highly oxygen-sensitive symbiotic bacteria demonstrate continuous, diffusive ventilation.
Strolling arthropods hypothesis.
The strolling arthropods hypothesis was a very early hypothesis for the evolution of discontinuous gas exchange cycles. It was postulated that discontinuous gas exchange cycles and spiracles which close off the respiratory system, may in part do so to prevent small arthropod parasites such as mites and particulate matter such as dust from entering the respiratory system. This hypothesis was largely dismissed in the 1970s, but has recently gained additional attention. The strolling arthropods hypothesis is supported by evidence that tracheal parasites can substantially limit O2 delivery to the flight muscles of active honeybees. As a result of large populations of tracheal mites, honeybees are unable to reach metabolic rates in flight muscle necessary for flight, and are grounded.

De Papegaai is the lesser of the two parochial churches in the St Nicholas Roman Catholic parish in Amsterdam. The church is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. It is nicknamed "De Papegaai" (The Parrot) because it was originally hidden in a garden behind a regular housefront that belonged to a bird-trader in the days when Catholicism could not be practised publicly. Today there is a narrow, Neo-Gothic facade flanked by statues of St Joseph and a perched parrot. The church is on the busy Kalverstraat, just south of Dam Square, and invites people in for quiet, as well as celebrating Sunday masses in Latin and with Gregorian chant.

One night, David fails to save the life of his patient Billy, who has committed suicide. Annie witnesses his death and is reminded of her own mother. Both feeling very emotional, Annie and David end up kissing each other. The next day, Annie feels guilty, but David assures her it was only an innocent kiss. One night, Tom is throwing a family party. Annie gives him a self-made painting, but the style reminds him too much of her mother's, which upsets him. They end up getting into a fight, after which Annie leaves.
The next evening, Annie serves as a replacement for Marsha, who was supposed to attend a play with David, but wasn't able to make it.

She says it's absolutely necessary as she's under a lot of stress with the launch of her book. Orson later begs Bree to let him sleep in his bed by promising not to snore. To prevent snoring, he makes two cups of chamomile tea and puts sleeping pills in Bree's. As he brings her the tea, she tells him that she already took a sleeping pill. He grabs the tea back from her before he goes to sleep. The next morning Orson intercepts a call from Andrew at the department store, where Bree was supposed to be ten minutes previously for the cooking demonstration. As she and Orson rush about she drinks the tea that was still on her bedside table. Bree walks up to the demo kitchen and acts goofy. In the doctor's office, Bree says Orson has agreed to the surgery. The doctor senses Orson is apprehensive. Bree says he's terrified but she doesn't care, since he owes her one. She also explains about the balance of power in a marriage but the doctor doesn't understand. The doctor calls his lover and makes them promise that they won't grow into one of those couples that makes each other crazy. His lover, who is Andrew, replies that he already made him crazy.
The cops ask Tom and Lynette a few more questions while Tom is getting his injuries treated, specifically regarding the fight between the club owner Schilling and Porter. Lynette denies that Porter had threatened Warren Schilling. In the Scavo house Lynette admits to Tom that Porter did threaten Schilling, despite Tom's denial. She says she heard him threaten Schilling and doesn't know what happened next. Lynette says they will protect their son even if he killed six people. Lynette later visits Anne Schilling at the hospital and tells her that her husband is blaming Porter. Anne says Porter would never do something like that. Lynette hands Anne a big wad of cash in an envelope to send Anne away. Lynette later drops off Anne at the bus station. Lynette hands her the money and tells her to not contact Porter when the baby comes. Lynette and Tom will do what they can from a distance. Anne admits that she was never pregnant and leaves. Lynette later asks Porter if he burned down the club and he replies that he didn't do it. Porter then asks whether she knows Anne's whereabouts, Lynette tells him that she doesn't know.
Meanwhile, Dave is stopped by a couple of cops to ask a few questions about the fire. The police say they know it was arson and that the body in the storage room is as yet unidentifiable. They also tell him he's a hero and he should be proud of himself. Dave goes to visit Mike. Mike wants to thank him for saving his life. Dave is humbled by his gratitude and asks him to become his brother since he had lost one. Later, Dave is watching news about the fire and found out that the death toll has risen to 7. Edie is worried that Dave is obsessed and says she heard the police are looking at Porter Scavo as she's always thought Porter was trouble. In the end of the episode, Dave walks up to the cops and explains he remembered seeing Porter coming out from back near the storage room on the night of the fire.

Laville DI-4

Laville DI-4 () was a prototype two-seat fighter aircraft developed in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. The chief designer Henri Laville was one of several French aviation specialists invited to work in the Soviet Union and not surprisingly the DI-4 layout was typical of the French trend at the time with a high-mounted gull wing (first for a Soviet aircraft) and all-metal construction. Test flight program was completed in 1933 but despite good performance the aircraft did not enter mass production, in part because Soviet Union had no plans to purchase the Curtiss V-1570 engine.

Gerhard Pleiss

Gerhard Pleiss or in German Gerhard Pleiß was a Hauptsturmführer (Captain) in the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler. He was born on 20 April 1915 in Remscheid. He went to an upper secondary school in Dortmund and then began as apprenticeship as an intern with the intention of becoming a Dentist.
On the 15 April 1936 he volunteered for the SS and was accepted into the Leibstandarte in Berlin and given the SS number 323 807. He attended the Junker school in Braunschweig, and on the 20 April 1939 was promoted to SS-Untersturmführer (Second Lieutenant)
In the Battle of France he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class for his actions at the river crossing at Pont-du-Château. During the 1941 Balkans Campaign he was the commander of the 1st Companie "LSSAH", and was given the task of securing the Klidi pass during the Battle of Vevi which at the time was being defended by British units. On 12 April 1941 contact was made and Pleiss captured the key position of Klidi which would allow the "LSSAH" to pass pass through and on into Greece. At dawn more British positions were identified and attacked, capturing more than 100 prisoners and 20 machine guns. Pleiss despite being wounded, had remained with his men until they were relieved.
The result of these actions was that the British front collapsed and the road into Greece was open and Pleiss was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.
At the start of Operation Barbarossa Pleiss was still in command of the 1st Company "LSSAH" which was attached to Army Group South. His company participated in an attack on Rostov on the Don river when on the 17 November 1941 he stood on a mine and lost both his legs, and died on the way to hospital. His final resting place can be found on the railway embankment at Taganrog.

Gloucester Green

Gloucester Green is a square in central Oxford, England, and the site of the city's bus station. It lies between George Street to the south and Beaumont Street to the north. To the west is Worcester Street and to the east is Gloucester Street.
The green was once an open space outside Gloucester College (now Worcester College), after which it was named. From 1783 to 1915 a fair was held on the green, and from 1835 to 1932 it was the site of the city's cattle market. In 1935, after the cattle market had been moved, the western half of Gloucester Green became the site of the city's bus station, and the eastern half became a car park. 
In 1987, a major redevelopment of the area began. The eastern half became a square, surrounded by shops, restaurants and residential accommodation. A new, smaller, bus station was built on the site of the old bus station, and an office block was built between the bus station and Worcester Street. An underground car park was also provided.
Today, the Gloucester Green bus station is the Oxford terminus for long-distance coach services, including the very frequent services to London and route X5 to Cambridge. The bus station is too small to accommodate more than a few local bus services. 
A food market is held in the square every Wednesday and an antiques market every Thursday.
Close by are the Burton Taylor Studio theatre on Gloucester Street and the OFS Studio in the Old Fire Station on George Street.

The Budweiser girls (or Bud girls) are women promotions model/agents for Budweiser beer maker Anheuser-Busch, as well as advertising characters based on the in-person promoters.
The company introduced the concept and name in 1883.
At various times the company featured Budweiser girls in television and print advertisements, and hired local models to visit bars in costume for in-person promotions. Throughout their history the Bud Girls have had a sexually provocative but cleancut image, avoiding women who smoked, swore, had tattoos or body piercings, or a criminal record. During the 1990s Anheuser-Busch distributors hired college girls to promote Budweiser on campus and to college bars.
Japan.
In 1990s, Budweiser girls appeared in Japanese TV commercials working as waitresses in beer gardens. Then Anna Umemiya appeared as a Bud girl, and the idea became more popular. Ayako Moriguchi was the first Bud girl to appear in print ads. You can buy Budweiser girl costumes in Cosplay shops. Also beer garden waitresses and hostesses will sometimes dress as Bud girls.

Shape waves

Shape waves are excitations propagating along Josephson vortices or fluxons. In the case of two-dimensional Josephson junctions (thick long Josephson junctions with an extra dimension) described by the 2D sine-Gordon equation, shape waves are distortions of a Josephson vortex line of an arbitrary profile. Shape waves have remarkable properties exhibiting Lorentz contraction and time dilation similar to that in special relativity. Position of the shape wave excitation on a Josephson vortex acts like a “minute-hand” showing the time in the rest-frame associated with the vortex. At some conditions, a moving vortex with the shape excitation can have less energy than the same vortex without it.

Biography.
Cupcake Brown was erroneously named when a nurse misunderstood her mother's post-delivery request. She remembers a happy childhood until the age of eleven when her mother died of choking on her tongue during her sleep (seizure). She was placed in several foster homes, in which she was abused both physically and sexually. She ran away and was subsequently introduced to prostitution. She later joined a gang after moving in with an aunt in LA. A few days before she turned sixteen, Brown was shot by a rival gang in a drive-by. The doctors told her that she may not be able to walk again. Three weeks after that, she decided to quit being a gang member and later that same year, she left the foster care system, declared legally emancipated. As an adult, Brown obtained work in a law firm, but continued struggling with drug addiction until she reached out to her boss for assistance and went to rehab. Thereafter, she earned her college degree at San Diego State University and attended law school at the University of San Francisco, graduating in 2001 with the Judge Harold J. Haley award for "unusual distinction, scholarship, character and activities" Brown went on to become an associate with the law firm of McCutchen Doyle Brown & Enerson (now Bingham McCutchen).

Psychemedics Corporation

Psychemedics Corporation is a United States corporation which provides patented, FDA-cleared, CAP certified clinical laboratory services for the detection of drugs of abuse. The company's corporate headquarters are located in Acton, Massachusetts and its laboratory operations are located in Culver City, California.
Technology.
Hair testing analyzes the hair shaft, rather than body fluids like urine or saliva, to determine whether illegal drugs are present. Compared to analysis of body fluids, hair testing is highly resistant to evasion by adulterating or substituting samples, or by simply abstaining from drug use for a few days. Psychemedics proprietary method for detecting drugs in hair uses radioimmunoassay and state-of-the-art GC/MS/MS or LC/MS/MS confirmation to measure the drug molecules and metabolites permanently entrapped in hair which were incorporated following ingestion. 
The Psychemedics technology includes tests for cocaine, marijuana, opiates (including heroin and oxycodone), methamphetamine, Ecstasy (MDMA), Eve (MDEA) and phencyclidine (PCP). A standard test of approximately one-and-one-half inches of head hair cut close to the scalp can provide a several month window to detect drug ingestion. 
In 2013, Psychemedics Corporation began offering hair based alcohol Ethyl glucuronide testing. This testing was previously attempted by laboratories in the United Kingdom, but has suffered from numerous lawsuits. Due to the concerns of legal risk, few laboratories offer this type of testing anymore, as they deem it unreliable and unsupportable. The Society of Hair Testing also notes the limitations of EtG, stating that this form of testing can determine "chronic excessive alcohol consumption only. This consensus is not applicable for determination of abstinence from alcohol or moderate consumption of alcohol." SoFT also states that "It is not advisable to use the results of the hair testing for alcohol markers in isolation," supporting the belief that additional testing evidence is required to properly identify an individual's alcohol usage. As such, this form of testing is only applicable for scenarios where severe alcohol abuse is present. 
The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has cautioned that the test is "scientifically unsupportable as the sole basis for legal or disciplinary action" because the highly sensitive tests "are not able to distinguish between alcohol absorbed into the body from exposure to many common commercial and household products containing alcohol or from the actual consumption of alcohol."
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not granted FDA clearance to the Psychemedics Corporation for their EtG Alcohol test at this time.

Günther Schwab

Günther Schwab (October 7, 1904 in Prague - April 12, 2006 in Salzburg, Austria) was an Austrian writer and author, and member of the Nazi party. He founded the World Union for Protection of Life.
Early life.
After the First World War his family, who were merchants, moved to Vienna, Austria, where Schwab discovered his love for nature. In Vienna, he joined NSDAP as well as Sturmabteilung (SA) in which he was a lieutenant from 1930.
As an editor of "Lebenschutz" (Protection of Life), he has been repeatedly accused of racism.
Through Prof. Dr. Günther Schlesinger, an Austrian Nature Protection Referent, Günther Schwab got more involved with nature protection. He studied in those years, as expected of the family, at the commercial academy, but due to his love for nature he soon became a forest ranger.
Environment and literature.
His first book "Abenteuer am Fluss" (Adventures At The River), published by Franz-Eher-Verlag, the Central publishing house of the Nazi party, was proof of his love. And so were all his following books "Der Wind über den Feldern" (The wind across the fields), "Kamerad mit dem haarigen Gesicht" (A story about a dog), "Land voller Grande" (Land of grace), "Das Glück am Rand" (Fortune at the edge).
In1951, he gave up his profession, moved to Salzburg and dedicated his life to writing. He realised that the new upcoming 1950s affluent society threatens to destroy all that he loves: the countryside with all its inhabitants, the solitude of the wilderness, the wildlife as he knew it up to then. Günther Schwab proved to be almost clairvoyant when, at the age of 50, he held a lecture with the title "The catastrophe has started already". This was at the Audi Max in Vienna in 1954.
The Dance with the Devil.
To put his fears more plain and understandably for the man in the street, Günther Schwab wrote his book "Der Tanz mit dem Teufel" (The dance with the devil). It reads like a subtle, interesting detective story, which he finished in 1958. The theme was mankind's industrial sins causing environmental damage in condemning many Americans as degenerates, and prophesized improperly managed population sizes from other continents would avalanche Europe. This was an effort to renew Social Darwinism and eugenics theories. His hope was to awaken the people. Strangely enough, although that book was on the market, there were some bookshops, which denied the existence of this book. The book was translated into other languages; the English version was published in 1963.
Society.
Schwab was a member of the Nazi party and during his life would serve on the advisory panel of the Society for Biological Anthropology, Eugenics, and Behavior Research.
Awards.
Günther Schwab reached 100 years of age in 2004 when he received the Cup of Honour of Salzburg and the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class. The appreciation of a man with such dedication and love for nature. He died on 12 April 2006.

Kenneth L. Kantor is an audio designer and businessman who helped shape the modern loudspeaker industry through a series of innovative products and technologies. He has been profiled in the "New York Times", been a guest on multiple radio and television venues and has appeared in dozens of interviews from "Forbes" to "Rolling Stone".
Psychoacoustics (the human perception of sound) were of particular interest to Kantor, and this became the underpinnings of much of the design work he has done for several companies.
Career.
Beginning in 1983 Kantor was director of Advanced research and development for Acoustic Research, at the time the world's largest loudspeaker manufacturer. He introduced a number of innovations, including the adaptive digital signal processor (or ADSP, the world's first digital signal processor room correction system), and the first psycho-acoustically enhanced loudspeaker system, the "Magic Speaker".
In 1986 Kantor co-founded and became executive vice president of Now Hear This (NHT), a successful speaker company, based on "Focused Image Geometry", a fundamental new psycho-acoustic technology. He played a key role in formulation of the business, marketing and product development efforts. Other designs include the SuperZero, the first affordable, high end bookshelf speaker; the industry's first complete, matched home theater system; and a patent for in-ceiling loudspeakers that dramatically improved off-axis frequency response. In 1990 NHT was sold to International Jensen, where Kantor was promoted to Vice President of Technology.
Kantor was a founder, CTO, and Senior Research Fellow for Tymphany Corporation. His principal invention was a driver design that solved performance issues from small form factor speakers targeted at the OEM car audio and television markets.
Kantor founded ZT Amplifiers, a musical instrument amplifier company. ZT uses proprietary DSP and amplifier technologies in a product line it imports from China.

Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-Zeitz-Hoym

Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-Zeitz-Hoym (Bernburg, 28 June 1669 – Bad Ems, 17 May 1727), was a German prince of the House of Ascania. 
The second son of Victor Amadeus, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, he married Charlotte of Nassau-Schaumburg, heiress to the County of Holzappel and Lordship of Schaumburg and founded a cadet branch of the House of Anhalt-Bernburg later named Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym.
Life.
Lebrecht was born on 28 June 1669 in Bernburg as the second son of Victor Amadeus, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg by his wife Elisabeth, daughter of Frederick, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken.
Excluded from the government of the principality of Anhalt-Bernburg after the introduction of primogeniture, Lebrecht acquired in 1707 the towns of Belleben, Hoym, Reinstedt, and Frose as compensation. When his father died in 1718, Lebrecht also inherited the town of Zeitz.
Marriages and Issue.
First marriage.
By a contract made on 1 September 1690 between his father and Elisabeth Charlotte Melander, Countess of Holzappel, Lebrecht was betrothed to Charlotte (b. Schaumburg, 28 September 1673 - d. Bernburg, 31 January 1700), the youngest of the three surviving daughters of the Countess with her late husband, Adolph, Prince of Nassau-Schaumburg. Under the terms of that contract, Charlotte was declared the sole heiress of the County of Holzappel (which included the towns of Holzappel and Charlottenberg) and the Lordship of Schaumburg. The marriage was performed in Schaumburg on 12 April 1692. They had five children:
Charlotte died in 1700, before the death of her mother, Elisabeth Charlotte of Holzappel-Schaumburg, making her eldest son Victor the heir apparent of Holzappel and Schaumburg. When Countess Elisabeth Charlotte died in 1707, Victor Amadeus Adolph succeeded her as Count of Holzappel and Schaumburg.
Second marriage.
A widower, Lebrecht was serving in the Netherlands when he fell in love with Baroness Eberhardine Jacobine Wilhelmine of Weede (b. Grave, 9 August 1685 - d. Grave, 13 February 1724), daughter of Baron Johann Georg von Weede, Governor of Grave (created a Baron by the Emperor in 1675; a Protestant himself, but married to a Catholic who raised their daughter in that religion). The couple was married in Grave on 27 June 1702. They had six children:
By contract of 23 February 1703, Lebrecht explained that after the death of his wife he wished not to remarry, so as not to diminish the possessions of the House of Anhalt through further partitions; but he found a way to reconcile his conscience with this intention by marrying a person who only looked for companionship in marriage and had no desire for princely rank. Remarriages with persons of unequal rank after a first equal marriage leaving posterity were not unusual in Germany, and under these conditions he obtained the consent of his father to this union.
The contract, signed by a notary and two witnesses, specified that the Baroness of Weede would not usurp the rank of princess or seek to be raised to that rank but would remain a baroness under the name of "Baroness of Bähringen," and never use the name, title, or arms of Anhalt for herself. A sum of 45,000 Thalers was set for her upkeep and that of her children, which would be used to purchase a suitable estate. Should she die without heirs, or at the extinction of her issue, the sum or the estate purchased with it would be returned to her husband and his heirs.
This contract notwithstanding, Lebrecht sought and obtained from the Emperor her elevation to the rank of Countess with the style of "Hoch- und Wohlgebohren" and new arms (1 August 1705). Lebrecht's father fought in vain to have this elevation reversed.
After the death of Lebrecht, the two surviving sons from his marriage with the Countess of Weede obtained the Bailiwick of Zeitz, but both died unmarried and childless.
Third marriage.
On 14 September 1725 Lebrecht married for a third time and again morganatically to Sophie Sibylla of Ingersleben (b. 18 March? 1684 - d. Hoym, 31 March 1726), a lady at his court and daughter of Just Adam of Ingersleben, of well-established Anhalt nobility. Despite all the efforts of her husband, the Reichshofrat denied Sophie the right to the styles "princely" and ""Durchlaucht"". Lebrecht survive her by only fourteen months.

DDT in Australia

The use of DDT in Australia has been fully banned since 1987.
DDT.
((Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane) (DDT) was a widely used synthetic pesticide before its usage was banned in many countries, following many campaigns that it is harmful to the environment and wildlife. It is a persistent organic pollutant with a half-life of 2-15 years. 
History.
DDT was first registered as an insecticide in Australia in the 1950s. A 1972 report from the Australian Academy of Science entitled "The Use of DDT in Australia" recommended continued use of DDT where its use clearly outweighed the disadvantages, plus further emphasis on research for alternatives.

Tupolev TB-6

Tupolev TB-6 (internal designation ANT-26; ) was a proposal for a 1930s heavy bomber that did not advance beyond blueprints. Inspired by the success of ANT-20/PS-124, Tupolev in 1929 began work on an even larger aircraft powered by 12 engines and with a takeoff weight of 70 tons (155,000 lb). A 1/20 scale two-seat glider was built and test-flown to evaluate the aerodynamic soundness of the design and work was started on the first prototype. By mid-1930s, the trend in military aviation shifted towards smaller and faster aircraft and TB-6 was canceled. ANT-28 was a proposed cargo version.

Pinchas Ben-Porat

Pinchas ("Pini") Ben-Porat (October 10, 1914 - July 27, 1955) was one of Israel's first aviators. He was involved in the Palavir, Sherut Avir, the IAF's 101 Squadron, and EL AL.
History.
Pinchas Ben-Porat was born in Krevoe Ozero, a small "shtetl" (Jewish village) in Ukraine. He was born Pinchas Anchipolovsky.
"Pinchas Ben-Porat" earned his flying license at the Aviron flying school, Israel's flying school before the establishment of the State of Israel. After acquiring 150 hours of flying time, he became the commander for Palmach's air platoon, the Palavir, in January 1944. The Palmach later sent him for further training in England, where he earned a commercial flying license. 
Ben-Porat returned to Palestine in 1947 and joined the Sherut Avir. On December 17, 1947, Ben-Porat was assigned a support role to Nevatim, a Jewish settlement in the Negev desert. When Nevatim came under attack by Arab irregulars, Ben-Porat flew an RWD 13 or Auster to Nevatim. Upon arriving, he removed the right door of the plane and set up a Bren gun and gunner with several hand grenades. Ben-Porat and his gunner flew a half-hour of close air support. The tactic was emulated by many Jewish pilots and crew in the Israeli War of Independence.
On May 9, 1948, Ben-Porat was one of ten pilots who left Israel to enroll in Avia S-199 training in Czechoslovakia. He broke his arm crash-landing an S-199 and flew transports during the first truce of the War of Independence. After the war he flew B-17s with 69 Squadron, which he eventually went on to command.
After the War of Independence, Ben-Porat was the first Israeli instructor in the Israeli Air Force flight academy. After a further tour flying B-17s, he left the military in 1950 and joined the Israeli state-owned commercial airline, El Al. On July 27, 1955, while co-pilot on El Al Flight 402, he was mistakenly shot down by the Bulgarian Air Force; all on board were killed.

The Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) manage over of forest, range, agricultural, and commercial lands for the people of Washington State. DNR also manages of aquatic areas which include shorelines, tidelands, lands under Puget Sound and the coast, and navigable lakes and rivers. Part of DNR's management responsibility includes monitoring of mining cleanup, environmental restoration, providing scientific information about earthquakes, landslides and ecologically sensitive areas. DNR also works towards conservation, in the form of Aquatic Reserves such as Maury Island or the Woodard Bay Natural Resource Conservation Area.
The main sources of funds for the department's activities are forestry and geoduck harvesting, rather than taxes. In addition, the State uses revenue generated from DNR-managed lands to fund the construction of public schools, colleges, universities and other government institutions, and county and state services.
The head of DNR is an elected official, referred to as the Commissioner of Public Lands. The current Commissioner of Public Lands is Peter Goldmark who was elected on November 4, 2008
Management of public lands.
Aquatic reserves.
Aquatic Reserves Areas which are designed to “conserve, preserve, restore, and/or enhance” aquatic habitats and species. There are four main goals of an Aquatic Reserve. The first goal is to conserve the native habitats of plants and wildlife species including forage fish, salmonids, and migratory birds. The second goal is to conserve the functions and native processes of the near shore ecosystem. The third is to maintain the territory, habitats and species through education and opportunities for public involvement. The fourth goal is promote responsible management of recreational, commercial and cultural uses of the reserve that relate to the previous goal.:)
Law enforcement.
DNR employs approximately 10 law enforcement officers who are located throughout the state. These officers patrol lands owned or managed by the DNR. DNR Officers are full-authority law enforcement officers while they are on DNR lands. Under state law DNR Officers are considered to be limited authority law enforcement officers since their state law enforcement authority is only applicable on lands owned by DNR. The majority of the County Sheriffs in Washington have commissioned all or their local DNR Officers as county deputies allowing them to act as a full authority law enforcement officer throughout the county, not only on DNR lands. DNR Officers are dispatched by the Washington State Patrol.

Uncial 0121b

Uncial 0121b (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), it was named as Fragmentum Uffenbachianum, or Codex Ruber. It is a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament, dated palaeographically to the 10th-century. The manuscript is very lacunose.
Description.
The codex contains parts of the Hebrews 1:1-4:3; 12:20-13:25 on two parchment leaves (). The text is written in two columns per page, 45 lines per page, in small semi-uncial letters, in red ink (hence "Codex Ruber"). The accents and notes of aspiration are carefully marked, but the iota subscriptum nowhere occurs. The Iota adscriptum occurs three times, ν εφελκυστικον is rare. The interrogative (;) occurs once (Heb 3:7), and inverted comma (>) is often repeated to mark quotations.
The letters are a little unusual in form small, and their character is between uncial and minuscule, and in the 19th century codex was classified as minuscule manuscript (catalogue number 53). Tregelles argued that they are more uncials by character, they are almost entirely separate, and sometimes joined in the same word. "They are certainly by no means cursive, in the common acceptation of the term". According to Scrivener they "can hardly be called "semicursive"". According to Günther Zuntz it is an uncial manuscript, its letters are that kind of uncial script, which scribes of the 10th and later centuries.
Size is the same like in Uncial 0121a, the number of lines is almost the same, and characters of letters are similar, therefore they were ascribed and classified as the same manuscript (f.e. F. H. A. Scrivener). They received catalogue number 0121 in system Gregory-Aland. Now after more accurate examination, it is sure, they belonged to the different manuscripts.
Text.
The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the mixed text-type. Aland placed it in Category III.
It does not contain verse Hebrews 2:1. The omission is supported by minuscules 1739 and 1881
In Hebrews 2:9 it reads χωρὶς θεοῦ ("apart from God") for χάριτι θεοῦ ("by the grace of God"). The reading of the codex is supported by 424c, 1739, mss, Peshitta, Origen, Theodore of Mopsuestia, St. Ambrose of Milan, St. Jerome, Fulgentius, Theodoret.
History.
Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 10th-century.
The manuscript came from Italy. It once belonged to H. van der Merk. In 1712 it was in Hague.
The manuscript once belonged to Conrad von Uffenbach (hence name "Fragmentum Uffenbachianum"), then to J. C. Wolf, and after his death in 1739 to the Public Library of Hamburg. It was very imperfectly described by Maius, Wettstein, Griesbach, and Bengel. Tregelles collated its text twice. Constantin von Tischendorf edited its text in 1855 (with 5 errors) and in 1861 corrected 5 errors.
The codex now is located in the University of Hamburg (Cod. 50), in Hamburg.

Aviron flying school

Aviron flying school ("trans." Airplane flying school) was established in April, 1936 in Palestine under the British Mandate (now Israel). The school was based in kibbutz Afikim, in Northern Israel.
History.
The "Aviron flying school" managed to order a Tiger Moth through the Yishuv and began operating in 1936. It was flown in by a British flight instructor named Grey and registered under the marks G-ACYN, with serial number 3314. The Aviron flying school also operated three Polish-made RWD-8 biplanes. The first 11 Aviron graduates earned their pilot licenses in 1939. "Aviron" later merged with Palestine Flying Service and acquired more aircraft. By 1942, Aviron had graduated 95 licensed pilots. Aviron collaborated heavily with Jewish underground defense force Haganah. The Haganah's elite wing, Palmach established an air platoon known as the Palavir in 1943. The Palavir trained its pilots at and operated out of "Aviron" until 1947 when the school moved to Lod Airport near Tel Aviv.

National Football League team captains

In the National Football League, the team captain designation is a team-appointed position that designates certain players as leaders on and off the field. The captains program was implemented by the NFL Player Advisory Council established by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell in conjunction with the NFL Players Association. Starting in , the league began permitting teams to name up to six players as captains.
Players who have been named a team captain typically have a "C" patch on their jerseys. There is a standard design used by all teams participating in the captaincy program. The patches are in team colors and are worn on the front left or right breast (depending on other patches, etc. worn by the specific team). The number of stars filled in on the patch represents the number of consecutive years that player has been named captain by that team. If they've been named captain for longer than four years, the "C" on the patch is gold. Some teams (i.e. Baltimore and New England) do not have this patch on their jerseys but still designate captains. The New York Jets have not designated team captains since an incident involving Santonio Holmes in a 2011 game. In the 4th quarter of the final game of the 2011 season against the Miami Dolphins, Holmes appeared to get into an argument with Jets offensive tackle Wayne Hunter while the team was huddling. As a result of the argument, Holmes was benched for the remainder of the game, and the Jets ended up losing the game, which resulted in the Jets missing the postseason for the first time in 3 years. His leadership qualities and credibility as a captain have since been questioned.
During special recognitions, the patch may be a different color; e.g., pink for breast cancer awareness; or camouflage for military service recognition.
Because of the nature of the game is played, most teams include their starting quarterbacks as Offensive Captain.

Challenge The Yankees

Challenge The Yankees was a popular baseball board game, sold only in 1964 and 1965 by Hasbro (Hassenfeld Bros.) of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The game and many of its components, especially the player cards is now a popular eBay item, consisting of 25 New York Yankees player cards, 25 All Star player cards (non-Yankees), a baseball diamond game board, cards representing different plays (single, double, triple, fly ball, ground ball) 4 pegs to move around the bases, manager strategy cards, and other accessories. The player up at bat rolls the dice, and refers to that "batter's" card, to check to see what that dice roll represents for that particular ball player, and moves a pegs accordingly. Each player's card is different, for example, a dice roll of 3 when Yogi Berra is at bat represents a home run, while a 3 rolled for Bill Mazeroski represents a base on balls. The object is to score the most runs at the end of 9 innings.
The 50 player cards in the set are approximately 4" × 5½", with a blank back, and feature a small black & white photo of the player, a facsimile autograph, and a few biographical details and stats. The only way to distinguish the cards between the two years is to compare the stats. There has been some confusion over the years about the 50 player cards in the 1964 set, and the 50 in the 1965 set. Some players are the same in both editions, and some are different.
Collectors.
Collectors like to be certain which year player card they are buying. Below is the complete listing of 1964 and 1965 cards. The ERA for pitchers and batting averages for the position players are noted in order to distinguish between 1964 and 1965. Only four of the 100 cards are identical for the two years: Yankees Hector Lopez and Tom Metcalf, and All Stars Carl Yastrzemski and Johnny Podres. Every other card differs in some small way, either by player fact, ERA or Batting Average.

The Way of the Sufi

The Way of the Sufi was the best-selling follow-up introduction to Sufism by the writer Idries Shah after the publication of his first book on the subject, "The Sufis". Whereas "The Sufis" eschewed academic norms such as footnotes and an index, "The Way of the Sufi" provided a full section of notes and a bibliography at the end of its first chapter, entitled "The Study of Sufism in the West".
Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, "The Way of the Sufi" can be read as part of a whole course of study.
Summary.
As in "The Sufis", Shah gave potted biographies of some of the best known Sufis of the ages, while adding brief descriptions of four of the major Sufi orders, or Tariqas: the Chisti Order, Qadiri Order, Suhrawardi Order and Naqshbandi Order. In addition there were a number of Sufi teaching stories as well as question-and-answer sessions with Sufi teachers. Continuing a theme from the previous book, Shah argued that Sufism had greatly influenced Western civilisation over the centuries, but that this had largely gone unrecognised, citing examples such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, the William Tell legend, the former United Nations secretary-general Dag Hammarskjoeld and the works of Sir Richard Burton amongst others. In the East, he also said that Sufism had influenced certain aspects of Hinduism as well as Zen Buddhism.
Reception.
The book was well received on publication, with the BBC's "The Critics" programme declaring it an "outstanding book of the year".
The New York Times also applauded the book, saying it was "like a door opening where one least expects it".
Writing in the British newspaper The Observer, Nobel Prize-winning author Doris Lessing described it as "a key book".

Pierre-Luc Létourneau-Leblond

Pierre-Luc "PL3" Létourneau-Leblond (born June 4, 1985) is a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger who is currently with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League. He plays a physical game and is known as an agitator and a fighter.
Playing career.
Following his rookie season in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) with the Baie-Comeau Drakkar, Leblond was selected 216th overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. He returned to Baie-Comeau for a second season before turning professional in 2005–06, splitting the season between Adirondack Frostbite of the United Hockey League (UHL) and the Albany River Rats of the American Hockey League (AHL). Leblond continued to play with the Devils' minor league affiliates until being called up to the NHL during the 2008–09 season. After an injury to forward Bobby Holik, he made his NHL debut on October 22, 2008, and registered an assist on a David Clarkson goal during a 5-0 victory over the Dallas Stars. Leblond dressed for eight Devils games during the season, registering the lone assist, as well as 22 penalty minutes.
At the beginning of 2009-10, Leblond signed a contract worth $1.575 million over three seasons. He played in a career-high 27 NHL games with the Devils, notching two assists. During the season, he also played five games in the AHL. Leblond began the 2010–11 season with the Devils. On October 9, 2010, in the final period of a 7-2 loss, Leblond attempted to fight Washington Capitals rookie Marcus Johansson. The fight took place with 4 minutes and 17 seconds remaining in the third period; Leblond was charged with an instigator penalty resulting in an automatic one-game suspension. Two days later, the Devils placed Leblond on waivers; after clearing, he was assigned to the Albany Devils. In 64 AHL games, he recorded 13 points (8 goals and 5 assists) and 334 penalty minutes.
On July 14, 2011, Leblond was traded to the Calgary Flames for a fifth-round selection in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. During his pre-season debut with the Flames, he received a two-minute penalty and ten-minute misconduct for hitting Vancouver Canucks forward Matt Clackson into the boards from behind. Following the game, he was suspended five games by the league, costing him $6,402.44 in salary, which was allocated to the NHL Players Association's Emergency Assistance Fund.
At the conclusion of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Leblond was invited on a try-out to the Anaheim Ducks training camp on January 13, 2013. He was then subsequently signed to a one-year contract with the Ducks two days later and was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals.
On August 20, 2013, Leblond signed a one-year AHL contract as a free agent with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. During the 2013–14 season, on November 7, 2013, Leblond was signed to a two-year year, two way NHL contract with parent affiliate, the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Pomacea diffusa

Pomacea diffusa, common name the spike-topped apple snail, is a species of freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Ampullariidae, the apple snails.
Taxonomy.
"Pomacea diffusa" was originally described as a subspecies of "Pomacea bridgesii". Pain (1960) argued that "Pomacea bridgesii bridgesii" was a larger form with a restricted range, with the smaller "Pomacea bridgesii diffusa" being the common form throughout the Amazon Basin (Brazil, Peru, Bolivia). Cowie and Thiengo (2003) suggested that the latter might deserve full species status, and the two taxa have been confirmed as distinct species by genetic analyses.
Distribution.
The type locality of "Pomacea diffusa" is in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, although the species is widespread throughout the Amazon Basin.
Non-indigenous distribution of "Pomacea diffusa" include:
Description.
"Pomacea diffusa" is known as the spike-topped apple snail, because of its relatively raised spire. It lacks a channeled suture, and overlaps in size with the "Pomacea paludosa".
The egg masses have an irregular honeycombed appearance, like those of "Pomacea haustrum", but are smaller and have a tan to salmon color, although the egg masses are white when freshly laid.

Octavia (effects pedal)

The Octavia was an effects pedal designed for Jimi Hendrix by his sound technician, Roger Mayer. It reproduces the input signal from a guitar one octave higher and/or lower in pitch, and mixes it with the original and added distortion fuzz.
Effect.
The Octavia consisted of an analog electronic circuit, which included a frequency doubler, envelope generator and amplitude modulator, together with additional frequency-shaping filter circuitry. The effect generated varied depending on use. For example, a clean tone from an electric guitar produced ring modulated overtones (as heard on the guitar solo in "Who Knows" by Jimi Hendrix.)
History.
The effect was used by Jimi Hendrix, and can be heard in guitar solos on the song "Purple Haze". Hendrix preferred to call the device the “Octavio”, and it is often referred to as such.
After Hendrix's death in 1970 one of the original Octavias became the basis for the redesigned "Octavia (TM)", manufactured by Tycobrahe Sound Company in Hermosa Beach, California, during the mid-1970s. A limited number of the devices were produced, and today a used one in good condition sells for over $1,000 on eBay. Stevie Ray Vaughan owned nine of these devices. Some versions of this and wah parapedals are being made under new Tycobrahe brand.

History of the oil tanker

The history of the oil tanker is part of the evolution of the technology of oil transportation alongside the oil industry.
Background.
The technology of oil transportation has evolved alongside the oil industry. Although anthropogenic use of oil reaches to prehistory, the first modern commercial exploitation dates back to James Young's manufacture of paraffin in 1850. In the early 1850s, oil began to be exported from Upper Burma, then a British colony. The oil was moved in earthenware vessels to the river bank where it was then poured into boat holds for transportation to Britain.
In the 1860s, the Pennsylvania oil fields became a major supplier of oil, and a center of innovation after Edwin Drake struck oil near Titusville, Pennsylvania. The first oil well in the United States was dug here in 1859, initially yielding around ten barrels per day. Within two years, the Titusville field was providing .
The invention of oil refining led to the availability of kerosene as lamp oil, which has a smokeless combustion in contrast with the until then highly used whale oil. The lamp oil became known as "Pennsylvania Kerosine". Due to overfishing, whale oil became rare and expensive. By this time, petroleum oil had already begun to supplant fish, whale, and vegetable oils for applications such as indoor and outdoor lighting, and transatlantic export had already begun.
Break-bulk boats and barges were originally used to transport Pennsylvania oil in wooden barrels. But transport by barrel had several problems. The first problem was weight: the standard empty barrel weighed , representing 20% of the total weight of a full barrel. Also barrels were leaky, and could only be carried one way. Finally, barrels were themselves expensive. For example, in the early years of the Russian oil industry, barrels accounted for half the cost of petroleum production.
Early Oil Tankers.
The movement of oil in bulk was attempted in many places and in many ways. Modern oil pipelines have existed since 1860. The first oil tankers were two sail-driven tankers that were built in 1863 on England's River Tyne.
The first ocean-going oil-tank steamer, the "Vaderland", was designed and built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company of the United Kingdom for the American-Belgian Red Star Line in 1873, although the vessel's use was soon curtailed by the authorities citing safety concerns. By 1871, the Pennsylvania oil fields were making limited use of oil tank barges and cylindrical railroad tank-cars similar to those in use today.
The Modern Oil Tanker.
The modern oil tanker was developed in the period from 1877 to 1885. 
In 1876, Ludvig and Robert Nobel, brothers of Alfred Nobel, founded Branobel (short for Brothers Nobel) in Baku, Azerbaijan. It was, during the late 19th century, one of the largest oil companies in the world.
Ludvig was a pioneer in the development of early oil tankers. He first experimented with carrying oil in bulk on single-hulled barges. Turning his attention to self-propelled tankships, he faced a number of challenges. A primary concern was to keep the cargo and fumes well away from the engine room to avoid fires. Other challenges included allowing for the cargo to expand and contract due to temperature changes, and providing a method to ventilate the tanks.
Even Tollefsen of Norway constructed one of the first successful oil tankers, called "Lindesnæs", in Tønsberg, Norway, in 1877. Many consider Nobel's "Zoroaster", built in 1878, as the world's first successful oil tanker. He designed this ship in Gothenburg, Sweden, with Sven Almqvist. The contract to build it was signed in January 1878, and it made its first run later that year from Baku to Astrakhan. The "Zoroaster" design was widely studied and copied, with Nobel refusing to patent any part of it. In October 1878 he ordered two more tankers of the same design: the "Buddha" and the "Nordenskjöld".
"Zoraster" carried its 242 long tons of kerosene cargo in two iron tanks joined by pipes. One tank was forward of the midships engine room and the other was aft. The ship also featured a set of 21 vertical watertight compartments for extra buoyancy. The ship had a length overall of , a beam of , and a draft of . Unlike later Nobel tankers, the "Zoraster" design was built small enough to sail from Sweden to the Caspian by way of the Baltic Sea, Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega, the Rybinsk and Mariinsk Canals and the Volga River.
When W.A. Riedmann of Geestemünde entered the petroleum trade in 1877, he noted the difficulties of using barrels, and began to experiment with the former emigrant ships "Adona" and "Derby," filling their large iron drinking water tanks with oil. In October 1879 he purchased the "Andromeda" at Liverpool, an 1876 ton full-rigged composite ship built in 1864, brought it to Teklenborgs Werft, and added seventy iron tanks to the hold. The piping between the tanks was connected so that all could be filled from a single tank. The composite hull, with structural members of iron covered with wooden planking, was especially suitable for the addition of tanks, because they could be firmly fastened to the iron beams. "Andromeda" made seven trips from Germany to North America as a sailing oil tanker.
Nobel also began to adopt a single-hull design, where the ship's hull forms part of its tank structure. In November 1880 he ordered his first single-hulled tanker, the "Moses". Within a year, he ordered seven more single-hulled tankers: the "Mohammed", "Tatarin", "Bramah", "Spinoza", "Socrates", "Darwin", "Koran", "Talmud", and "Calmuck". Branobel experienced one of the first oil tanker disasters. In 1881 "Zoroaster"'s sister-ship, "Nordenskjöld", exploded in Baku while taking on kerosene. The pipe carrying the cargo was jerked away from the hold when the ship was hit by a gust of wind. Kerosene then spilled onto the deck and down into the engine room, where mechanics were working in the light of kerosene lanterns. The ship then exploded, killing half the crew. Nobel responded to the disaster by creating a flexible, leakproof loading pipe which was much more resistant to spills.
In 1883, oil tanker design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British engineer Colonel Henry F. Swan designed a set of three Nobel tankers. Instead of one or two large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship to capsize. But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers "Blesk", "Lumen", and "Lux".
Others point to The "Glückauf", another design of Colonel Swan, as being the first modern oil tanker. It adopted the best practices from previous oil tanker designs to create the prototype for all subsequent vessels of the type. It was the first dedicated steam-driven ocean-going tanker in the world and was the first ship in which oil could be pumped directly into the vessel hull instead of being loaded in barrels or drums. It was also the first tanker with a horizontal bulkhead, its features included cargo valves operable from the deck, cargo main piping, a vapor line, cofferdams for added safety, and the ability to fill a ballast tank with seawater when empty of cargo. The ship was built in Britain and was purchased by Wilhelm Anton Riedemann, an agent for the Standard Oil Company along with several of her sister ships. After the "Glückauf" was lost in 1893 after being grounded in fog, Standard Oil purchased the sister ships.
In 1903, the Nobel brothers built two oil tankers which ran on internal combustion engines, as opposed to the older steam engines. The "Vandal", the first diesel-electric ship, was capable of carrying 750 long tons of refined oil was powered by three diesel motors. The larger "Sarmat" employed four 180 h.p. engines. The first seagoing diesel-powered tanker, 4,500 ton "Mysl", was built by Nobel's competitors in Kolomna. Nobel responded with "Emanuel Nobel" and "Karl Hagelin", 4,600 long ton kerosene tankers with engines.
The 475 ft., 7-masted schooner "Thomas W. Lawson", built in 1902, was the largest purely sail tanker ever built. It carried coal, and oil in barrels from Texas to the East Coast of the U.S. This 5,218 GRT schooner was fitted out as an oil tanker in 1906, and sunk in a storm off Isles of Scilly in Dec. 1907.
Asian Oil Trade.
The 1880s also saw the beginnings of the Asian oil trade. The oil industry in Azerbaijan was the largest producer in the world at that time, but was limited to the Russian market. John D. Rockefellers Standard Oil dominated the world market.
The idea that led to moving Russian oil to the Far East via the Suez Canal was the brainchild of two men: importer Marcus Samuel and shipowner/broker Fred Lane — the London agent for the De Rothschild Frères. Prior bids to move oil through the canal had been rejected by the Suez Canal Company as being too risky. Samuel approached the problem a different way: asking the company for the specifications of a tanker it would allow through the canal.
Armed with the canal companies specifications, Samuel had James Fortescue Flannery designing tankers for Bnito — the Russian oil company of the Rothschilds — and ordered three tankers from William Gray & Company in northern England. Named the "Murex", the "Conch" and the "Clam", each had a capacity of 5,010 long tons of deadweight. In 1893 the Samuel brothers founded the Tank Syndicate together with Fred Lane and Asian trading companies. In 1897 it was renamed Shell Transport and Trading company, forerunner of today's Royal Dutch Shell company.
With facilities prepared in Jakarta, Singapore, Bangkok, Saigon, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Kobe, the fledgling Shell company was ready to become Standard Oil's first challenger in the Asian market. On August 24, 1892, the "Murex" became the first tanker to pass through the Suez Canal.
In the meanwhile, in 1890 the "Koninklijke Nederlandsche Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Petroleumbronnen in Nederlandsch-Indie" (KNMEP) ("Royal Dutch Company for the Working of Petroleum Wells in the Dutch Indies") — part of Royal Dutch Petroleum — was founded. In 1892 it found oil near Pangkalan Brandan on Sumatra, just some months before Samuels kerosene arrived in Singapore. At first, chartered ships were used, but in 1896 KNMEP launched its first tankers, the "Besitang" and "Berandan". The threat of the Tank Syndicate was reduced as the Dutch government excluded them from trading in the Dutch East Indies. To prevent a hostile takeover by Standard Oil, preference shares were issued. By the time Shell merged with Royal Dutch Petroleum in 1907, the company had 34 steam-driven oil tankers. Standard Oil started building tankers the same way as Shell and by 1900 owned around 60 tankers.
From 1912 "Compañía Mexicana de Petróleo El Aguila" ("Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company") — founded in 1909 by Weetman Pearson to develop the newly found Mexican oil fields, nationalized in 1938 as Pemex — also had its own tanker fleet. They quickly adopted Isherwood's new longitudinal framing system that allowed much larger ships and a simpler construction process. Just before World War I it owned a fleet of 20 tankers. Standard Oil did not participate directly in the newly discovered oil fields in Texas — such as Spindletop — and Oklahoma, which gave opportunities for new oil companies as Gulf Oil and Texas Fuel Company, later Texaco. Avoiding the use of Standard Oil's pipe line system, they started using tankers to get their oil to the East Coast. In combination with the oil fields discovered in Mexico and Venezuela, this caused a rise in the demand for tankers, which gave opportunities for the first independents, such as the Norwegian Wilh. Wilhelmsen, that launched its first tanker in 1913.
World War I and interbellum.
Underway replenishment was quickly adopted by other navies. One example of this is the Australian fleet oiler which provided underway replenishment services in the United Kingdom's Royal Navy from 1917 to 1919.
During World War I, unrestricted submarine warfare caused a shortage of tankers. The United States ambassador to the United Kingdom, Walter Hines Page, wrote ""The submarines are sinking freight ships faster than freight ships are being built by the whole world. In this way, too, then, the Germans are succeeding. Now if this goes on long enough, the Allies' game is up. For instance, they have lately sunk so many fuel oil ships, that this country may very soon be in a perilous condition — even the Grand Fleet may not have enough fuel"". Georges Clemenceau wrote to US president Wilson ""Gasoline is as vital as blood in the coming battles…a failure in the supply of gasoline would cause the immediate paralysis of our armies"". Wilson reacted strongly. The War Shipping Board commandeered all ships in the United States and also took over all yards. An unprecedented budget of $US1.3 billion was used for this end. At Hog Island, the largest shipyard in the world was built, known for the Hog Islander.
Between 1916 and 1921, 316 tankers were built with a total capacity of 3.2 million long tons of deadweight, where the entire world fleet before World War I was just above 2 million tons. In 1923 about 800,000 long tons were laid up, which gave enormous opportunities for speculators, such as Daniel Keith Ludwig. In 1925 he had bought the freighter "Phoenix" and put tanks in the holds. These riveted tanks leaked, which resulted in an explosive mixture. The resulting explosion killed two crew members and badly injured Ludwig. After this, he was a strong believer in welding.
The bunkering of ships with oil instead of coal, mass-production of automobiles and increasing aviation, all increased demand for oil and thus oil transport.
In 1928 the World's largest oil tanker was the , completed that year for Canadian owners by Bremer Vulkan in Germany.
With the right connections at the Shipping Board, ships could be bought cheaply, which caused a lot of fraud. This system was too complicated for the oil companies however, so when World War II started, independents owned 39 percent of the world tanker fleet. This was especially because oil companies needed capital to invest in the growing oil market. By not buying the ships, but chartering, the bond rating of the oil companies was not affected, because the charter hire was not recognized as debt in that time. In 1934 H.T. Schierwater founded the International Tanker Owners’ Association — later International Association of Independent Tanker Owners or INTERTANKO — to protect the interests of thes companies in a strongly fluctuating market.
World War II.
When World War II broke out in 1939, Roosevelt could not support the United Kingdom directly, as in 1935 the Shipping Neutrality Act was signed to prevent Mussolini from invading Ethiopia. A solution was found by flagging out to Panama, which was under US control. The advantage for shipping companies was not having to comply with US regulations and not having to sail with US crew which were 50 percent more expensive than European crews at that time. In 1939 there were 52 tankers with a total capacity of 700,000 long tons of deadweight under Panamanian flag, a boost for flags of convenience.
The block construction method was invented in the United States, because German U-boats were sinking more ships than could be built with existing methods. By building in blocks and welding, the construction time could be reduced dramatically. Daniel Keith Ludwig had an important role in this, as he introduced the method at his Welding Shipyards in Norfolk as part of the Emergency Shipbuilding program.
Particularly the T2 tanker played an important part in World War II. The T2-SE-A1 with a capacity of 16,613 long tons of deadweight, was the most popular variant with nearly 500 built during the war. After the war these tankers were used commercially for decades, and many were sold on the international market.
In this period, the World Scale was introduced to determine freight tariffs.
Until 1956, tankers were designed to be able to navigate the Suez Canal. This size restriction became much less of a priority after the closing of the canal during the Suez Crisis of 1956. Forced to move oil around the Cape of Good Hope, shipowners realized that bigger tankers were the key to more efficient transport.
Supertanker era.
Where the size of tankers had been more or less the same for 25 years, after World War II they have grown in size significantly, initially slowly. A typical T2 tanker of the World War II era was long and had a capacity of . A modern ultra-large crude carrier (ULCC) can be long and have a capacity of . Several factors encouraged this growth. Hostilities in the Middle East which interrupted traffic through the Suez Canal contributed, as did nationalization of Middle East oil refineries. Intense competition among shipowners also played a part. But apart from these considerations is a simple economic advantage: The larger an oil tanker is, the more cheaply it can move crude oil, and the better it can help meet growing demands for oil.
Where the refinery of oil had taken place near the well earlier, this moved to the consumer location during this stage. Oil production in the Middle East developed and the dominance of product tankers was replaced by crude oil carriers. Soon, Panamax tankers were built, soon followed by Aframax and Suezmax tankers because of economics.
After the war, it was expected that a large number of tankers would be laid up, which indeed happened. The United States Maritime Commission had replaced the War Shipping Board, but fraudulent activities remained. Aristotle Onassis and Stavros Niarchos used this to buy tankers cheaply. The expected economic decline did not come, due to reasons amongst others the Marshall plan, with the demand for oil increasing to the point in 1947 that there was a shortage of tankers. Freight tariffs tripled overnight, enabling some to recoup their investment in one voyage.
Ludwig had started Universe Tankships in 1947 and began building larger tankers in his Welding Shipyards. The "Bulkpetrol" of 30,000 long tons was the largest tanker of its time. Four of the five Bulk class tankers sank, likely because welding technology was not yet fully understood. As larger ships could not be constructed in the yard at Norfolk, Virginia, Ludwig went to Japan where he introduced the block construction method at the Kure Naval Yard. Here, in 1952, he built the "Petrokure" of 38,000 long tons. That same year, Onassis had a tanker of 45,000 long tons built and also Niarchos had supertankers built. Both Onassis and Niarchos claimed to be the largest independent tanker owner in the world.
The "Sinclair Petrolore" that Ludwig had built in 1955, was at 56,000 long tons not only the largest freighter in the world, but also a self-unloading ore-oil carrier, the only one of that type ever built. It exploded on 6 December 1960 near Brazil — likely because of cargo leakage in the double bottom — resulting in the largest spill until then with 60,000 tons.
In 1956 the "Universe Leader" of 85,000 long tons was built just before the Suez Crisis started with the seizure of the "Pannegia" . In ten years time, tanker size had quadrupled. In 1958, Ludwig broke the barrier of 100,000 long tons of heavy displacement. His "Universe Apollo" displaced 104,500 long tons, a 23% increase from the "Universe Leader".
In 1962 Niarchos had the 106,000 long ton built. This was the largest merchant vessel ever built in the United States. It was converted to have ice breaking capacities in 1969 and was the first commercial ship to cross the Northwest Passage. Although the voyage was a success, a second attempt to cross the passage in winter proved impossible, and there were numerous environmental concerns with the project, so it was cancelled and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System built.
In 1966 the "Idemitsu Maru" of 206,000 long tons was built. In twenty years, the size of tankers had increased tenfold.
Closure of the Suez Canal.
The oil spill caused by the "Torrey Canyon" in 1967 caused a public awareness about the environmental dangers of oil tankers. Oil companies united in 1970 in the Oil Companies International Marine Forum to become involved in the following issuing of rules such as MARPOL 73. In 1968 also the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation was founded to indemnify the victims.
For tanker owners, the Six-Day War of 1967 was of greater importance. The Suez Canal closed until 1975 and freight rates skyrocketed because of the shortage of tonnage now ships had to pass the Cape of Good Hope. Even larger tankers were now built, as the limitations of the Suez Canal were not governing anymore. In only a couple of years the size of tankers quadrupled to more than 500,000 long tons and there were even plans for tankers of 1,000,000 long tons. In 1969 the first ULCC's were built.
The world's largest supertanker ever was built for Tung Chao Yung in 1979 at the Oppama Shipyard of Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd. as the "Seawise Giant". This ship was built with a capacity of , a length overall of and a draft of . She has 46 tanks, of deck, and is too large to pass through the English Channel.
"Seawise Giant" was renamed "Happy Giant" in 1989, "Jahre Viking" in 1991. From 1979 to 2004 she was owned by Loki Stream, at which point she was bought by First Olsen Tankers, renamed "Knock Nevis" and converted into a permanently moored storage tanker. The Batillus class supertankers are the biggest ships ever constructed by gross tonnage.
Although the tanker fleet increased around 12 percent annually around 1970, a shortage on tonnage remained. In 1973 this resulted in an enormous increase in new building orders, especially from oil majors that wanted to gain on the quicker deciding independents, who could ask enormous rates for their vessels. Where the existing tanker fleet comprised some 150 million long tons, in a quarter of a year a tonnage of 75 million was ordered, although new build prices doubled.
The increase in scale brought a new problem. Until then, the washing of tanks after cargo discharge was done by water. In December 1969 three tankers exploded during tank washing. The Dutch Shell tanker "Marpessa" sank off Dakar and became the largest merchant vessel ever lost. The other two, the British Shell tanker "Mactra" en the Norwegian "Kong Haakon VII" were damaged heavily, but remained afloat. Shell investigated the matter and came to the conclusion that water drops that impact steel with high velocity generates static electricity that can cause explosions in combination with cargo vapors. This only became apparent with the large sizes of the tanks of VLCC's.
The solution was found by filling the cargo tanks with inert gas (IG), reducing the oxygen level such that the tank remains below the explosive limit. The use of IG is seen as the biggest step in increasing tanker safety. Ten years later however, fifty people were killed when the "Betelgeuse" exploded at Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay. The Total tanker was still not fitted with inert gas. The "Energy Concentration" did have this system, preventing an explosion when it broke in two on 21 July 1980 during discharge at Europoort. It has also saved many lives during the Tanker War.
Washing with water in combination with the Load on Top system was replaced by crude oil washing (COW), a method developed by BP. The advantages were cleaner tanks, no corrosive sea water in cargo tanks and no polluted sea water being pumped overboard.
Oil Crisis and consolidation.
On 10 October 1973 the Yom Kippur War begun, causing the 1973 oil crisis, tripling oil prices to US$10 per barrel, halting economic growth. New build ships sometimes went straight from the yard to lay up. The situation worsened when the Suez Canal was reopened in 1975. Just when the situation begun to improve in 1979, the Iranian Revolution caused the second oil crisis, causing oil prices to rise to US$30. Ships were sometimes sent to the breakers after being in service for only ten years. It took until the end of the 1980s before any profits were being made in oil transport.
In 1979, World-Wide Shipping of Yue-Kong Pao with 204 vessels, many of them tankers, was the largest shipping company in the world with a tonnage of 20.5 million, but in the five years after that he sold some 140 vessels to manage the crisis. In 1980 Daniel K. Ludwig had the largest fleet after Y. K. Pao and C. Y. Tung and was regarded the richest man of the United States. Currently, John Fredriksen owns the largest tanker operator in the world, Frontline. He also owns almost ten percent of the largest shipping company in the world, Overseas Shipholding Group.
In 1976, the "Intervention Convention" was used for the first time when the US Coast Guard took on the salvage of the "Argo Merchant", although the vessel was in international waters. This was the first time the monopoly of flag states was broken through.
The Exxon Valdez oil spill was the incentive to introduce legislation requiring tankers to have a double hull, a measure that is not seen as the best solution by all experts. Where a double hull should minimize the consequenses after a disaster, Concordia Maritime developed the "Stena V-MAX", a VLCC with two propellers, two rudders and two redundant engine rooms, where a single fault does not result in loss of steering, reducing the chances of a grounding.
The size of VLCC's and ULCC's limits their sailing area and available ports. In the United States, Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) is the only facility that is able to handle VLCC's. To overcome this, lightering from large tankers in smaller ones that are able to reach the destination port. The largest oil terminal is Ras Tanura in Saudi Arabia.
ULCC's had not been built since the beginning of the 1980s until the Greek Hellespont Steamship Corporation ordered four double hull supertankers in 1999. These ships were built in 2002 and 2003 as the "Hellespont Alhambra", "Hellespont Metropolis", "Hellespont Tara" and "Fairfax". Hellespont sold these ships to Overseas Shipholding Group and Euronav in 2004. These TI class supertankers — currently known as the "TI Asia", "TI Europe", "TI Oceania", and "TI Africa" — are as of 2008 the worlds four largest working supertankers.
Each of the four sister ships has a capacity of over , a length overall of and a cargo capacity of . The first ULCC tankers to be built for some 25 years, they were also the first ULCCs to be double-hulled. To differentiate them from smaller ULCCs, these ships are sometimes given the "V-Plus" size designation. In February 2008, their owners announced plans to convert "TI Africa" and the "TI Asia" into stationary floating storage and offloading units to be placed in the Al Shaheen oilfield near Qatar in late 2009.
With the exception of the pipeline, the tanker is the most cost-effective way to move oil today. Worldwide, tankers carry some annually, and the cost of transportation by tanker amounts to only US$0.02 per gallon at the pump.
Flags of convenience.
The first open register was Panama in 1916. Fear for political instability and high and excessive consular fees led the president of Liberia, William Tubman, in 1948 to start an open register with the help of Edward Stettinius, Jr.. The "World Peace" of Stavros Niarchos was the first ship in that register. In 1967 Liberia passed the United Kingdom as the largest register. Nowadays, Panama — currently the largest register — and Liberia have one third of the world fleet under their flag.
Flags of convenience have lower standards for vessel, equipment, and crew the traditional maritime countries and often have classification societies certify and inspect the vessels in their registry, instead of by their own shipping authority. This made it attractive for ship owners to change flag, whereby the ship lost the economic link and the country of registry. With this, also the link between classification society and traditional maritime country became less obvious - for instance Lloyd's with the United Kingdom and ABS with the United States. This made it easier to change class and introduced a new phenomena; "class hopping". A ship owner that is dissatisfied with class can change to a different class relatively easily. This has led to more competition between classes and a relaxation of the rules. This has led to the shipping industry losing confidence in the classification societies, but also by the European Commission.
To counteract "class hopping", the IACS has established TOCA (Transfer Of Class Agreement).
In 1978, a number of European countries agreed in The Hague on a memorandum that agreed to audit whether the labour conditions on board vessels were according the rules of the ILO. After the "Amoco Cadiz" sank that year, it was decided to also audit on safety and pollution. To this end, in 1982 the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (Paris MoU) was agreed upon, establishing Port State Control, nowadays consisting of 24 European countries and Canada. In practice, this was a reaction on the failure of the flag states - especially flags of convenience that have delegated their task to classification societies - to comply with their inspection duties.

Macchi M.9

__NOTOC__
The Macchi M.9 was a flying boat bomber produced in Italy close to the end of World War I, and shortly afterwards. It was a conventional design for its day, with unstaggered biplane wings of unequal span and a single engine mounted pusher-fashion on struts in the interplane gap, close to the underside of the top wing. The pilot and observer sat side by side in an open cockpit. While earlier Macchi flying boats had conventional interplane struts, the M.9 introduced the Warren truss-style struts that would become characteristic of this manufacturer's designs.
Around 16 examples were delivered to the Italian Navy prior to the Armistice, and around another 14 were assembled after the end of hostilities. A small number of postwar aircraft were built with four seats under the designation M.9"bis" and were used in Switzerland for carrying passengers and mail.

Harnas Wildlife Foundation

Harnas Wildlife Foundation is an organization located in Namibia, approximately 300 km east of the capital Windhoek. Harnas is one of the few wildlife orphanages and medical centers in the world to take in abused, injured, and captured wild animals from Namibia, Botswana, and southern African nations, saving hundreds of animals per year.
Its mission is to protect life; done through the responsible and effective management, regulation and understanding of the resources necessary for this task.
History.
The Harnas Wildlife Foundation has been on the forefront of nature conservation and wildlife tourism for over 34 years. 
The farm was originally fenced as a cattle farm and acted as such as main source of income for its residents until fairly recently. It all started in 1978 when Nick and Marieta van der Merwe saved an abused vervet monkey from its captors for five Rand and some bread.
This monkey was the beginning of a long line of animals that found refuge at their farm, Harnas. Shortly thereafter a zoo in South Africa went defunct and its lions were given into the care of the Van der Merwe family. To cover the ever-increasing costs of food, new enclosures and medical treatment, all of which the family had financed until then through profits from their cattle, Harnas opened its doors to visitors and contributors.
This Wildlife 'refuge' became a reality, and over the years expanded to become a major role player in conservation and wildlife campaigns. The site now comprises enclosures, voluntary headquarters, safari tours, guest farm and a huge surrounding conservation land around the main hub. Once fit and able to leave the main enclosures, the previously injured and traumatized animals are set free in this wilderness, to roam as they would in their natural habitat.
Locations.
Harnas Wildlife Foundation currently operates from Gobabis area
Harnas Gobabis
Harnas Gobabis is the main contact point between man and animal. The original farm and location for all operations and projects like the animal clinic, Cheeky Cheetah Day-care centre, adult literacy project, a running lodge, lapa and various research stations. There are various animal enclosures, free roaming game camps and grazing camps for domesticated animals such as cattle and goats. The farm is roughly 10 000 hectares big and situated in the central Kalahari, a region that is mostly flat savannah locally known as sand-veld.
Animals.
There are many types of animal that take refuge at Harnas, from Lion, Cheetah, Leopard, Caracal, Eagles, Meercat, Mongoose, Zebra, Baboon, African Wild Dog, Springbok, and a population of feral animals on site.
Harnas Lifeline Project.
Which is the primary soft release area, also used to gather vital information on semi wild animal in a natural environment.
Adult Literacy Program.
At the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, 90% of the employees are people from the San community and through the years we have realized that it is not only the animals that needs to be taken care of. We have established an adult literacy program to teach members of the San community basic useful life and job skills so that no matter where they may migrate to, they are educated to take care of themselves. The program is open to any member of the community and lasts around 6 months. Woman learn skills in arts and crafts, jewellery making, housework and needlework and men are equipped with knowledge of welding, building and woodwork. Upon completion each member receives a certificate showing their ability in the specific training area and stating their completion of the course.
Cheeky Cheetah Kids Project.
When the Van Der Merwe family were looking for schools for their own children, they realized that they had the ability to provide the basic education and general skills for not only their own, but for many of the San people that they employ. The Cheeky Cheetah day care center was established to provide the children day care with the necessary education, food and to equip them with the basic knowledge to, when they reach the right age, be able to adapt and attend a primary school.
After 5 years the school consists of a fully furnished school with of one big classroom, showers, toilets, and an outdoor play area. 
Children are further helped by being placed in public schools where they are continuously supported through financial support; paying of school, hostel and other fees, as well as clothing, food and other needs.
International Patronage.
The international patrons of Harnas Wildlife Foundation are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

The Sandman is a children's book written by Ralph Fletcher and illustrated by Richard Cowdrey. It was first published in 2008 by Henry Holt and Company.
Plot summary.
Tor is an inches tall man who can not fall asleep no matter what he tries. He discovers a dragon scale while walking in the woods. He learns that the powder made by grinding the scale induces sleep. He then travels sprinkling the sand into the eyes of sleepless children.
Reception.
Ian Chipman in his review for Booklist said "Fletcher’s spin on the classic character responsible for suddenly leaden lids is helped along by Cowdry’s quaint, deeply hued artwork." He described the book as "charming and comforting bedtime tale." Kirkus Reviews said "Fletcher's fantasy narrative fleshes out the familiar trope by combining worlds of fairy-tale-forest settings with average household bedtime environments. Cowdrey's deeply colored acrylics of flora, fauna, one frightfully greenish and nostril-smoking dragon, workshop scenes and angelically dozing children alternate with black-and-white images of a cherubic dimple-chinned bald and white mustachioed tiny gentleman hard at work." Lauralyn Persson in her review for School Library Journal said "Fletcher's smoothly written story flows in a thoroughly plausible way and is beautifully served by Cowdrey's vibrant acrylic paintings. All in all, this is a compelling story with pictures that add drama, charm, and atmosphere."

Computational thinking

Computational Thinking (CT) is a problem solving method that uses computer science techniques. The term "computational thinking" was first used by Seymour Papert in 1996. Computational thinking can be used to algorithmically solve complicated problems of scale, and is often used to realize large improvements in efficiency.
Overview.
The phrase "computational thinking" was brought to the forefront of the computer science community as a result of an ACM Communications article on the subject by Jeannette M. Wing. The article suggested that thinking computationally was a fundamental skill for everyone, not just computer scientists, and argued for the importance of integrating computational ideas into other disciplines.
Center for Computational Thinking.
Computational thinking today is spearheaded by the Center for Computational Thinking at Carnegie Mellon. The Center's major activity is conducting PROBEs or PROBlem-oriented Explorations. These PROBEs are experiments that apply novel computing concepts to problems to show the value of computational thinking. A PROBE experiment is generally a collaboration between a computer scientist and an expert in the field to be studied. The experiment typically runs for a year. In general, a PROBE will seek to find a solution for a broadly applicable problem and avoid narrowly focused issues. Some examples of PROBE experiments are optimal kidney transplant logistics and how to create drugs that do not breed drug resistant viruses.
Computational Thinking (CT) for Pre-College levels.
While Computational Thinking is mostly practiced in college level education, it has gained its ground in K-12 levels in STEM education. You may find a small handful of online institutions which provides curriculum, and other related resources to build and strengthen pre-college students with Computational Thinking, Analysis and Problems Solving. One prominent one is the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy. It offers a rich array of training sessions for both pre-college students, as well as teachers. Its programs exercise instructional scaffolding methods via engineering process. There is also another online site named legoengineering.com. offering similar resources.
As far as a physical facility, in Central New Jersey, there is a small institution, named Storming Robots, offers technology programs to Grade 4 to 12 with focus on Algorithmic and Computational Thinking via robotics projects throughout the school year. Students may follow its road map starting from Grade 4 until they graduate to college.
Characteristics of Computational Thinking.
Computational Thinking is a problem-solving process that includes the following characteristics:

Hinchinbrook Channel

The Hinchinbrook Channel is a channel between the Australian mainland and Hinchinbrook Island. It runs for 50 km between Oyster Point, just south of Cardwell, and Lucinda in Far North Queensland. The Aboriginal name for the channel is Bolan Milbirmi. The Herbert River flows into the channel's southern point. 
The Hinchinbrook Channel is protected within the Hinchinbrook Island National Park, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Dugong feed and seek habitat in the sea grass patches along the channel seafloor. The channel is bordered by extensive, deltaic mangrove forests.
The residence time of the channel is roughly 50 days. This long period is due to the lack of mixing of water in creeks and mangrove forests with offshore water.

The Female of the Species (Kipling poem)

"The Female of the Species" is a poem by Rudyard Kipling originally published in 1911. The title and refrain has been used as a title for at least three other works (see "The Female of the Species (disambiguation)").
Analysis.
It begins with illustrations of the (alleged) greater deadliness of the females of different species, the Himalayan bear, the cobra and the native American, who frightened the Jesuits more than the men. It continues with the general thought that women, "must be deadlier than the male", as she is formed for the one purpose - motherhood. Woman, says Kipling, has the greater determination - the greater courage and single-mindedness in the pursuit of the important in life.
References in other media.
"The Female of the Species" and its refrain have been used as a catchphrase in other works. In 1928 the Bulldog Drummond story: "The Female of the Species" may have lifted the title. This story was adapted as the 1967 European spy movie "Deadlier Than the Male". Scott Walker of The Walker Brothers wrote and performed the accompanying musical theme and scored a minor hit on the UK Singles Chart in 1966. In 1996 the English pop group Space released "Female of the Species". The title was again lifted in 2006 for Joanna Murray-Smith's satirical play "The Female of the Species". A 1946 novel by James Hadley Chase was titled "More Deadly Than The Male".
It is recited by the character of Denis Thatcher, played by Jim Broadbent, in the "The Iron Lady", 2011.

Architecture of the oil tanker

Oil tankers generally have from 8 to 12 tanks. Each tank is split into two or three independent compartments by fore-and-aft bulkheads. The tanks are numbered with tank one being the forwardmost. Individual compartments are referred to by the tank number and the athwartships position, such as "one port", "three starboard", or "six center."
A cofferdam is a small space left open between two bulkheads, to give protection from heat, fire, or collision. Tankers generally have cofferdams forward and aft of the cargo tanks, and sometimes between individual tanks. A pumproom houses all the pumps connected to a tanker's cargo lines. Some larger tankers have two pumprooms. A pumproom generally spans the total breadth of the ship.
Hull designs.
A major component of tanker architecture is the design of the hull or outer structure. A tanker with a single outer shell between the product and the ocean is said to be "single-hulled." Most newer tankers are "double-hulled", with an extra space between the hull and the storage tanks. Hybrid designs such as "double-bottom" and "double-sided" combine aspects of single and double-hull designs. All single-hulled tankers around the world will be phased out by 2026, in accordance with amendments to Annex I of the MARPOL Convention. IMO distinguishes three categories of tankers that will be phased out:
Phased out types.
PreMARPOL tanker.
Category 1 tankers have been phased out in 2005. These so-called preMARPOL tankers were single hull only with some segregated ballast tanks. Around one third of the cargo tanks also acted as ballast tanks. During ballast discharge oil was released into the environment. These tankers did not extent high above the water line, allowing Hydrostatically Balanced Loading (HBL), so relatively little oil was spilled in case of bottom damage.
MARPOL tanker.
Category 2 tankers were used for a number of years and were planned to be phased out by 2010 at the latest, depending on the year of delivery. With MARPOL tankers, it is not allowed to use ballast tanks as cargo tanks. This has reduced operational spillage drastically. The downside is designs based on MARPOL spill more oil when damaged than a preMARPOL tankers. This is due to several factors:
Category 3.
These small tanker will also be phase out by 2010.
New types.
After the "Exxon Valdez" disaster, public outcry became so strong that authorities were forced to come with preventive measures. Especially the double hull design was favoured and although this is not the best design in all cases, because of OPA 90, this is the only design currently in operation.
Double hull.
OPA 90 caused the phasing out of single hull tankers in the United States between 1997 and 2000 — apart from tankers lightering off the coast, which are allowed to be single hull until 2015. In this design, cargo tanks are protected by ballast tanks of at least 2 metres. As long as this barrier is not breached, there will be no spillage.
In 1998, the Marine Board of the National Academy of Science conducted a survey of industry experts regarding the pros and cons of double-hull design. Some of the advantages of the double-hull design that were mentioned include ease of ballasting in emergency situations, reduced practice of saltwater ballasting in cargo tanks decreases corrosion, increased environmental protection, cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier, tank washing is more efficient, and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.
The same report lists the following as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including more expensive to build, more expensive canal and port expenses, ballast tank ventilation difficult, ballast tanks need continual monitoring and maintenance, increased transverse free surface, more surfaces to maintain, explosion risk in double-hull spaces if vapor detection system not fitted, cleaning mud from ballast spaces a bigger problem.
In all, double-hull tankers are said to be safer than a single-hull in a grounding incident, especially when the shore is not very rocky. The safety benefits are less clear on larger vessels and in cases of high speed impact.
Other downsides of this design are:
Although double-hull design is superior in low energy casualties and prevents spillage in small casualties, in high energy casualties where both hulls are breached, oil can spill through the double-hull and into the sea and spills from a double-hull tanker can be significantly higher than designs like the Mid-Deck Tanker, the Coulombi Egg Tanker and even a pre-MARPOL tanker, as the last one has a lower oil column and reaches hydrostatic balance sooner.
Mid-Deck Oil Tanker.
A Mid-Deck Tanker is a tanker design, which includes an additional deck intended to limit spills if the tanker is damaged. The extra deck is placed at about the middle of the draft of the ship.
With double hull tankers, in high energy casualties where both hulls are breached, oil can spill through the double-hull and into the sea. In grounding events of this type, a mid-deck design overcomes this by eliminating the double-bottom compartments that are void with air. Since the density of seawater is greater than that of oil, water comes into the tanks instead of oil escaping out, and rather than spilling, oil is vented upwards into overflow tanks.
If the "Exxon Valdez" had been a Mid-Deck ship, she would have spilled very little oil.
Coulombi Egg Tanker.
A variation on the Mid-Deck Tanker is the Coulombi Egg Tanker, which was approved by IMO as an alternative to the double hull concept. The design consists of a series of centre and wing tanks that are divided by horizontal bulkheads. The upper wing tanks form ballast tanks and act as emergency receiver tanks for cargo should the lower tanks be fractured. The lower tanks are connected to these ballast tanks by non-return valves. The United States Coast Guard does not allow this design to enter US waters, effectively preventing it from being built.
When a lower tank is damaged, the incoming sea water pushes the oil in the damaged tank up into the ballast tank. Because of the hydrostatic pressure, there is an automatic transfer out of the damaged tank. The double-hull design is aimed at the probability of zero outflow. In low energy casualties where only the outside hull is penetrated, this will be the case. However, in high energy casualties both hulls are penetrated. As the tanks of a double hull tanker are larger than those of MARPOL-tankers and preMARPOL-tankers and the height of the cargo above the water line is higher, the resulting spill can be much larger than these single hull designs. In the Coulombi Egg design spillage is greatly reduced, possibly to zero.
Where a double hull VLCC has a ballast tank coated area of about 225,000 m³, in a Coulombi Egg tanker this area is reduced to 66,000 m³. This reduces maintenance and corrosion risks, which otherwise may result in structural failure.
Inert gas system.
An oil tanker's inert gas system is one of the most important parts of its design. Fuel oil itself is very difficult to ignite, however its hydrocarbon vapors are explosive when mixed with air in certain concentrations. The purpose of the system is to create an atmosphere inside tanks in which the hydrocarbon oil vapors cannot burn.
As inert gas is introduced into a mixture of hydrocarbon vapors and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. At the same time it decreases the upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.
Inert gas systems deliver air with an oxygen concentration of less than 5% by volume. As a tank is pumped out, it's filled with inert gas and kept in this safe state until the next cargo is loaded. The exception is in cases when the tank must be entered. Safely gas-freeing a tank is accomplished by purging hydrocarbon vapors with inert gas until the hydrocarbon concentration inside the tank is under about 1%. Thus, as air replaces the inert gas, the concentration cannot rise to the lower flammable limit and is safe.

Fauna Foundation

The Fauna Foundation is the only chimpanzee sanctuary in Canada. Located just outside Chambly, on the South Shore of Montreal, the Foundation was established in 1997 by Gloria Grow and Dr. Richard Allan on their farm. Its primary objective, the rescue and care of chimpanzees who have been used in research, began in the wake of the shutdown of LEMSIP.
It is the first sanctuary to accept chimpanzees with HIV.
In 2012, author Andrew Westoll won the Charles Taylor Prize for his non-fiction book "The Chimps of Fauna Sanctuary", detailing his encounters with the chimpanzees at the foundation.
In August 2013, chimpanzees Loulis and Tatu from the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute (CHCI) moved to the sanctuary.

American Samoa gubernatorial election, 2008

The 2008 American Samoa gubernatorial election took place on November 4, 2008, coinciding with the 2008 United States general elections and the American Samoa general election. Because no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, a runoff election between the top two candidates was held on November 18, 2008, which Togiola Tulafono won. All elections in American Samoa are officially non-partisan, but Tulafono and Sunia identify with the Democratic Party.
Candidates.
Incumbent Governor Togiola Tulafono and Lieutenant Governor Ipulasi Aitofele Sunia announced their intent to seek re-election on May 10, 2008. They are being challenged by three nonpartisan team tickets. Candidates for governor and lieutenant governor are elected under the same ticket. All elections in American Samoa are nonpartisan.
Election background.
Governor Togiola Tulafono and Lieutenant Governor Ipulasi Aitofele Sunia announced their intent to seek re-election on May 10, 2008. Their formal announcement, which Tulafono called "the worst kept secret of this season," took place before a crowd of approximately three hundred supporters at the Tradewinds Hotel in Tafuna.
Afoa Moega Lutu formally announced his own candidacy for Governor of American Samoa at a campaign rally at the same Tradewinds Hotel on May 17, 2008. The rally consisted of about seven hundred Lutu supporters. Lutu promised to tackle a number of issues if elected Governor, including corruption, rising food and energy prices and the economy.
Utu Abe Malae and his running mate, Nua Mailo Saoluaga, formally announced their candidacy on June 10, 2008, at a gathering at the Maliu Mai Beach Resort in Pago Pago.
This is not the first time that Tulafono and Lutu faced each other in a gubernatorial election. Tulafono defeated Lutu in the 2004 gubernatorial runoff election with 56 percent of the total vote to Lutu's 44 percent. Lutu also fell short in his bids for Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa in the 1996 and 2000 elections, losing both times to Tulafono.
The President of the American Samoa Senate, Lolo Moliga, also originally announced his intention to run for governor as well. However, Lolo withdrew from the race on June 13, 2008, just two months into his campaign, citing existing commitments to his extended family clan. He also noted the need to prevent divisiveness within the families of the Manu'a islands, where many of the gubernatorial and Lt. governor candidates have ancestral ties.
Four of the 2008 candidates for governor or lieutenant governor in the 2008 election either were from or had ancestral ties to the Manu'a Islands. Those with Manu'a ancestry are incumbent Lt. Governor Ipulasi Aitofele Sunia, lieutenant governor candidate Velega Savali, and both members of the gubernatorial team of Utu Abe Malae and his running mate, Nua Mailo Saoluaga.
The deadline to register as a candidate for Governor in the current election was September 1, 2008, at 4:30 P.M. An official list of the four teams was released by the election office the following day.

Theophilus Levett

Theophilus Levett (1693–1746) was an attorney and early town clerk of Lichfield, Staffordshire, a prominent early Staffordshire politician and landowner, and a member of a thriving Lichfield social and intellectual circle which included his friends Samuel Johnson, the physician Erasmus Darwin, the writer Anna Seward and the actor David Garrick, among others.
Life.
Theophilus Levett was married to Mary Babington, the daughter of Zachary Babington, a lawyer, High Sheriff of Staffordshire and influential early figure in Lichfield history. Levett and his wife later inherited Babington properties at Curburough, Whittington and elsewhere in Staffordshire. The Babington family had been prominent in the Lichfield Cathedral for two centuries and as local barristers. Dr. Zachary Babington, great-grandfather of barrister Zachary, was precentor of Lichfield Cathedral, as well as diocesan chancellor, and died at his estate Curborough Hall in 1613.
An early friend of Samuel Johnson's before the author went off to Oxford, Levett later assumed the mortgage on Johnson's mother's Lichfield home for £80 on 31 January 1739, when Johnson was 31 years old, a debt that Theophilus Levett's son John continued to carry after his father's death. Hardpressed for cash, Johnson and his mother had only one substantial asset after the death of his father, who had invested in a parchment-making operation that failed. Levett offered Johnson favorable terms and advanced him ready money in return for holding the mortgage, easing Johnson's financial bind. Theophilus Levett and Johnson were frequent correspondents, and they remained lifelong friends, despite Levett's occasional inquiries about overdue payments.
Theophilus Levett had St. John's House (later Yeomanry House) opposite St. John's hospital built for himself before 1732. Levett's new home "replaced a house known in 1577 as Culstubbe Hall, the home of the physician Sir John Floyer in the late 17th century," according to the Victoria County History of Staffordshire. The Levett home was demolished in 1925.
Descendants.
Theophilus Levett's daughter Anne was, according to Anna Seward, the early paramour of actor David Garrick. Garrick, wrote Seward, "was the lover of her early youth. When he quitted Lichfield to become a theatrical adventurer, he had her promise to be his the instant his situation became profitable." The romance was not to be: Anna Levett ultimately married her cousin Rev. Richard Levett of West Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. The episode prompted Seward to pen her poem "Portrait of Miss Levett" about the fickle Lichfield beauty.
The descendants of Theophilus Levett and his wife Mary Babington went on to become prominent in Lichfield and Staffordshire for more than two centuries, serving as High Sheriffs of Staffordshire, Members of Parliament, investors in Matthew Boulton's Soho Manufactory at Birmingham, as well as rectors of the local church at Whittington and elsewhere. Several streets in today's Lichfield are named for the early town clerk and his family. The family is of Anglo-Norman descent and originated in Sussex, arriving in Staffordshire from Cheshire. Theophilus Levett was named for Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon, whose wife the Countess of Huntingdon was Levett's godmother.
Career.
Theophilus Levett served as Steward (town clerk) of Lichfield from 1721–1746, during which time he was a prominent player in the town's political affairs, occasionally narrowly averting political disaster. In 1718 and 1721 Levett narrowly escaped prosecution for sedition after declaring his Jacobite sympathies. After Levett retracted his statements, the matter was dropped but not without a storm of controversy.
The imbroglio began in 1718 when Levett prevented the Town Clerk from saying 'amen' to the final 'God Save the King' when a brief was read in church. Levett, according to testimony, had "clapt his Hand upon the Deponent's Mouth," and the Clerk "Blubbered" to the bemusement of the congregation. Three years passed before Levett again stirred up controversy. A candidate for coroner and Town Clerk, Levett was accused of wearing white roses on June 10, as well as drinking toasts to the Pretender "with other Gentlemen who were reconned the Jacobites of the Town."
Subsequently, all Levett's accusers retracted their statements, and he was elected to office as Town Clerk. Levett's accusers claimed they had been manipulated into testifying against him by local Whigs. One accuser, a "poor servant girl" named Alice Hayes, even claimed that one prominent local Whig gentleman had promised to marry her if she swore falsely against the aspiring politico. Shortly afterwards, a petition was sent to the King, signed by 185 Lichfield worthies, including Michael Johnson, the father of Samuel, a favor that Levett later repaid when he arranged a tutor's job for Samuel Johnson at the home of Thomas Whitby in Great Haywood, near Lichfield, after Johnson's father's death.
Because of his position, Levett became a major powerbroker in LIchfield. In a letter to the Earl of Dartmouth and the Deputy Lieutenants from 1745, Levett gives a snapshot of the influence he wielded, and showed there was little doubt about where he stood on the question of the Monarchy. "By command of Lord Gower," Levett wrote, "I beg to call a meeting for 9 October to consider whether it will be more for his Majesty's service and the ease of the county, to call out the militia or to raise some companies of foot and a troop or two of horse, by virtue of commissions to be granted by Lord Gower, with a declaration that they shall be disbanded as soon as the present troubles are over."

Bradford Keeney

Bradford Keeney, Ph.D. (3 April 1951) is a creative therapist, cybernetician, anthropologist of cultural healing traditions, traditional healer, shaman, and improvisational performer. Bradford Keeney has served as a professor, founder, and director of clinical doctoral programs in numerous universities. He is the originator of several orientations to psychotherapy including improvisational therapy, resource focused therapy, and creative therapy. He is the inventor of recursive frame analysis, a research method that discerns patterns of transformation in conversation. A Clinical Fellow of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, he received the 2008 Distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award from the Louisiana Association for Marriage and Family Therapy.
As an ethnographic fieldworker, Keeney has been called the Marco Polo of psychology and an anthropologist of the spirit by the editors of Utne Reader. He spent over a decade traveling the globe, living with spiritual teachers and healers who trusted him to share their words with others – modern cultures in need of elder wisdom. The result of Keeney's work is one of the broadest and most intense field studies of healing, chronicled in the critically acclaimed book series, Profiles of Healing, an eleven-volume encyclopedia of the world's healing practices.
Biography.
Bradford Keeney was born in Granite City, Illinois, and grew up in Smithville, Missouri. In May 1969, he won a merit award from the American Medical Association, and later first place at the international science fair with a project called “An Experimental Study of the Effects of Hydrocortisone, Insulin, and Epinephrine on the Glycogen Content of Hepatic Tissues Perfused in Vitro.” This award earned him a scholarship to M.I.T. where he was first introduced to cybernetics and systems thinking. Fascinated by cybernetics, Keeney sought out Gregory Bateson, one of the world’s leading cyberneticians, who became his friend and mentor. Keeney’s doctoral dissertation (Purdue University, 1981) became the book "Aesthetics of Change" (1983), considered a seminal work in cybernetic theory and heralded by the likes of cybernetician and systems theorist Heinz von Foerster.
Bradford Keeney is married to and conducts all his work with Hillary Keeney, PhD, with whom he has co-authored seven books. 
He is the father of notable Los Angeles based DJ, DJ Skee.
Ethnographic Fieldwork, Ecstatic Healing and Spirituality.
Since 1995, Bradford Keeney has traveled the globe conducting ethnographic studies of ecstatic healing traditions, focusing on “shaking medicine”. Keeney’s work culminated in the creation of the Profiles of Healing series for the Ringing Rocks Foundation, describing ecstatic healing practices on four continents. Keeney’s experiences were chronicled in the biography "American Shaman". Currently, Keeney synthesizes what he learned from traditional and ecstatic healers with creative psychotherapy to add recursivity and performance to psychotherapeutic encounters.
As a traditional healer or shaman, Bradford Keeney is accepted as a n/om kxao or traditional doctor. The Kalahari Bushmen regard Keeney as the highest level of traditional doctor, a "Heart of the Spears,” and the Zulu of southern Africa recognize him as having passed all levels of being a traditional healer or sangoma. Dr. Keeney is also the authorized custodian (with his wife, Hillary Keeney) of the tradition of seiki jutsu (the art of the vital life force.) In addition, Keeney is also a member of the Shakers of St. Vincent, and recognized as a grandfather shaman among the Guarani Indians and a traditional spiritual healer in Brazil, Mexico, and Bali, among other places in the world.
Bradford Keeney is co-founder of The Keeney Institute for Healing, dedicated to the development and dissemination of ecstatic healing and spirituality. The Keeney Institute conducts experiential training and education for healers, therapists, body workers, clergy, and the general public in the U.S. and at institutes throughout the globe. The work of the Keeney Institute is rooted to other ecstatic healing traditions including Kalahari Bushman (San) healing, the shakers of the Caribbean, and seiki jutsu Japanese energy medicine, among others.
Dr. Keeney serves as project director for the Kalahari Bushman (San) N/om-Kxaosi Ethnographic Project. This project was originally a collaboration between the Institute of Religion and Health at the Texas Medical Center, Houston, Texas, the Kalahari People’s Fund, and the Rock Art Research Institute of the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. Since roughly 1995, data has been collected in Botswana and Namibia, focusing on the religion and healing practices of the Ju/’hoan Bushmen. Dr. Keeney has collaborated with Megan Biesele, Ph.D., an original member of the Harvard Kalahari Research Project and the Director of the Kalahari Peoples Fund to both document the healing traditions of the Kalahari Bushmen or San people and apply what is learned to Western psychotherapeutic interactions.
Recognized as an ecstatic spiritual teacher and healer by numerous cultures, Keeney became a n/om-kxao (healer) with the Kalahari Bushmen. Megan Biesele, Ph.D., former member of the Harvard Kalahari Research Group, writes: "There is no question in the minds of the Bushman healers that Keeney's strength and purposes are coterminous with theirs. They affirmed his power as a healer."
With his wife, Hillary Keeney, he co-founded The Keeney Institute for Healing, dedicated to the development and dissemination of ecstatic healing and spirituality.
Work in cybernetics and psychotherapy.
Keeney is known for several important contributions to the field of psychotherapy, through his application of cybernetics to the discipline. While serving with such institutions as the Menninger Foundation, the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania, the Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy, and several universities throughout the United States, Dr. Keeney developed the following groundbreaking ideas.
In his early work, Keeney articulated patterns of communication for distinguished psychotherapists, later using his own psychotherapeutic cases to show how one can use psychotherapy as an art to create successful therapeutic transformation in clients. Some of his major works include "Aesthetics of Change" (1983), "Mind in Therapy" (1985), "The Creative Therapist" (2009), "Circular Therapeutics: Giving Therapy a Healing Heart" (with Hillary Keeney, 2012), Creative Therapeutic Technique" (with Hillary Keeney, 2013), and the Profiles of Healing series on ecstatic healing traditions sponsored by the Ringing Rocks Foundation (1999 – 2008). In 2010, Bradford Keeney and his wife, Hillary Keeney, created an online doctoral program in creative systemic studies at the University of Louisiana, Monroe. It is the first non-clinical MFT program of its kind dedicated to interdisciplinary scholarship and the study of cybernetics and systems thinking - the originating ideas of the field of systemic family therapy.
Recursive frame analysis.
Keeney developed Recursive Frame Analysis (RFA) as a qualitative research method for discerning patterns in therapeutic conversation. It is a method he describes as “scoring” conversations, much as one would a song. Through RFA “…Keeney derived a series of distinctions which would allow therapists and researchers to describe interactional patterns in therapeutic discourse and to guide their practice in therapy.” RFA has been used in numerous dissertations and research studies. It is currently being used to demonstrate the different ways one can analyze conversation in a wide variety of conversational settings, including couples and family interaction, counseling, political diplomacy, and doctor-patient discourse.
Resource focused therapy.
With his colleague Wendel Ray, Keeney created “Resource Focused Therapy.” Resource Focused Therapy is an approach to psychotherapy that pays little or no attention to problems or difficulties that have become pathologized. This form of therapeutic intervention focuses entirely on “bringing forth the natural resources of both clients and therapists”. This focus on resources is a recontextualization of information presented that therapeutically and creatively changes the way the client interacts with the world. It is a performative communication that occurs in acts, and looks to observers much more like an improvised play than classical therapy. The goal of this interaction is to transform the client’s situation from one that is impoverished to one that amplifies resources and ability.
Creativity in therapy.
Building on the concepts from his Resource Focused Therapy model, Keeney has developed a concept of creativity in therapy that moves beyond the norms of psychotherapy to view the therapist/client interaction as a transformative, performative, improvisational art. This work is based on clinical case studies that have been filmed and archived over the last decade. The theoretical model uses theories of improvisation in the performing arts and systemic ideas to provide a way of understanding how clinical sessions can become more creative and effective.
Publications.
Keeney published numerous books and papers. A selection of academic books

Mount Coffee Hydropower Project

The Mount Coffee Hydropower Project is a hydroelectric project in the West African nation of Liberia on the Saint Paul River. Built in 1966 with additional phases completed later, the project had a maximum generating capacity of 64 MW. The Walter F. Walker Hydro Dam and generating facilities were extensively damaged during the First Liberian Civil War and are not currently functioning.
History.
In 1963, the Liberian government received a loan from the World Bank to develop a USD $24.3 million hydro electric project. Construction of the facility began in 1964 by the Monrovia Power Authority using Raymond Concrete Pile Company as the contractor and Stanley Consultants as the project managers. In 1966, the power company completed the initial phase of the dam and began generating electricity. The project was finished in 1967 and named the T. J. R. Faulkner W.F. Walker Hydroelectric Power Station.
Initial generating capacity was 30 MW produced by two turbines, which was increased to 64 MW when two more turbines were added in 1973. The Monrovia Power Authority became the Liberia Electricity Corporation on July 12, 1973. In June 1990, the government announced plans to more than double the electricity generating capacity of the project and adding a reservoir to allow more generation during the dry season. The plans called for a new dam to be built upriver on the Via River to provide storage capacity, while two 52 MW turbines would be added at the existing power generating plant. The US$300 million expansion was never begun due to the Civil War.
In July 1990, rebel forces under the command of Charles Taylor seized the dam and shut off power and water to Monrovia. During this First Civil War, the project’s intake dam was destroyed on one end while the rest received other damage. Other parts of the facilities were looted and destroyed in later years of the conflict. Beginning in early 2005, proposals were made to repair the facility and restore power, including a proposal by China.
The United States Trade and Development Agency gave $400,000 to Liberia in February 2007 to study rebuilding and expanding the project. The study showed no structural damage to the dam, but that most of the project’s facilities would need to be rebuilt at a cost of US$383 million. As of August 2008, the Liberian government was considering privatization of the project for a fixed number of years as the nation did not have the resources to fund the repair.
In May 2012, the Mt. Coffee Hydropower Rehabilitation Project was initiated with a series of surveying and engineering assessments of the feasibility of revitalizing the plant. This work culminated with the signing of a contract in April 2013 with a Norwegian company (Norplan AS) and a German company (Fichtner GmbH) to revitalize the defunct power-plant by 2015.
Details.
Located in the Harrisburg Township of Careysburg District, Montserrado County, it lies on the Saint Paul River approximately 21 miles from Monrovia. The dam is a run-of the river style dam, in that there is no reservoir. Due to the lack of a reservoir, the dependable generating capacity is only 10 MW, as that is the normal flow of the river during the dry season. Prior to the First Liberian Civil War the plant produced 64MW of electricity, which accounted for 35% of all electricity generated in the nation. In addition to electricity, the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation used the project to provide drinking water to Monrovia and surrounding areas before the war.

United States Army Gas School

The United States Army Gas School was established during World War I at Camp A.A. Humphreys in Virginia. The first courses began in May 1918 and the school was designed to instruct commissioned and noncommissioned officers in chemical warfare.
History.
In late October 1917 the War College was badly underprepared for large-scale chemical warfare in World War I. With many U.S. soldiers operating in a chemical environment with no knowledge of chemical warfare the War College requested a British gas officers and NCOs, the requests were granted. The British experts arrived and were directed and coordinated by Major S.J.M. Auld. Auld was tasked with composing a "working textbook on gas" for the U.S. Army.
Among Auld's recommendations was an idea the General Staff had already been considering, the establishment of a central Army Gas School. As a result of Auld's suggestion the Army Gas School was established at Camp A.A. Humphreys, Virginia. The school, beginning in May 1918, offered two initial courses. One course was a four-day class on general information about gas warfare and was offered to commissioned and noncommissioned officers. The second course was a 12-day affair for Chief Gas Officers which went into greater detail about chemical warfare.
Upon its establishment, Ross A. Baker was given charge of training for Chief Gas Officers at the Army Gas School. Baker was the Chief Gas Officer at Camp Pike in Arkansas and a professor of chemistry at the University of Minnesota before taking the post at Camp Humphreys. Later in the month of October 1917 the entire Army Gas School operation was transferred to Camp Kendrick.

2011 IndyCar Series season

The 2011 Izod IndyCar Series season was the 100th recognized season of American open wheel motor racing. The season was sanctioned by IndyCar and was part of the Mazda Road to Indy. The season began in March and concluded in October, consisting of seventeen events.
It was the final season running the IR–05 Dallara spec cars, which has been the series' sole chassis supplier since 2007. The events took place in twelve states of the United States, as well Canada, Brazil, and Japan. The schedule featured ten street/road courses and eight on oval tracks. The premier event was the 95th Indianapolis 500, won by Dan Wheldon.
Dario Franchitti claimed his fourth IndyCar title. Franchitti went into the final race of the season leading Will Power by 18 points. The race, and the season, was marred by a 15-car pile-up early in the race that claimed the life of two-time Indy 500 winner and 2005 champion Dan Wheldon. The race was canceled, and the final points total reverted to the previous event, with Franchitti claiming the title.
Rookie of the Year honors went to Canadian James Hinchcliffe, who led American J. R. Hildebrand in the rookie standings by 6 points going into the final race. Hildebrand's season was highlighted by a nearly winning the Indianapolis 500. His second place finish at Indy earned him top rookie honors for that event.

Technoetic

Technoetics is a neologism introduced by Roy Ascott, who coined the term from "Techne" and "noetic theory", to refer to the emergent field of technology and consciousness research
Definitions.
Technoetic relates to that which concerns the technology of consciousness. Such technology may be telematic, digital, genetic, vegetal, moist or linguistic.
Technoetics is a convergent field of practice that seeks to explore consciousness and connectivity through digital, telematic, chemical or spiritual means, embracing both interactive and psychoactive technologies, and the creative use of moistmedia. Roy Ascott, "2008 - Technoetic Art Intellect Books 2003".
History of technoetics.
Technoetics is a syncretic research area linked to the transdisciplinary methodology between art and science. This is rooted in the research of Roy Ascott and his Planetary Collegium, including its CAiiA-Hub, Milan-Node, Zurich-Node, and Ionion-Node research community. The term appeared for the first time in 1997 in the Ascott paper: "The Technoetic Aesthetic: Art and the Matter of Consciousness". In: R. Ascott (ed) Consciousness Reframed: art and consciousness in the post-biological era. 1st International CAiiA Research Conference Proceedings. Newport: University of Wales College, Newport.
Recent developments.
The emergence of Technoetics can be juxtaposed with a number of other innovative interdisciplinary areas of scholarship which have surfaced in recent years including technoscience and technocriticism.

Tim Kask

Timothy James Kask (born January 14, 1949) is an American editor and writer in the role-playing game industry. Kask became interested in board games in his childhood, and later turned to miniatures wargames. While attending university after a stint in the US Navy, he was part of a group that playtested an early version of the new role-playing game "Dungeons & Dragons" (D&D) for game co-designer Gary Gygax. Gygax hired him as the first employee of TSR, Inc. in 1975. After editing some of TSR’s early "D&D" publications, Kask became editor of "The Strategic Review", which later became "The Dragon", and then "Dragon Magazine".
Kask left TSR in 1980 to start Manzakk Publishing. He left the games industry in 1983, and spent some time as a freelance editor and speechwriter before becoming a teacher. In 2010 he returned to the games industry as one of the co-founders of Eldritch Enterprises.
Early life.
Tim Kask was born and raised in Moline, Illinois. At age 11, he became interested in Avalon Hill's board wargame "D-Day", and played it frequently for three years. During a four-year stint with the US Navy (1967–1971) during the Vietnam war, he often played "1914", another Avalon Hill game. He married his wife Cheryl in 1970, and they have a daughter, and a son.
After leaving the Navy, Kask attended Southern Illinois University’s campus in Carbondale, Illinois. While there, he was introduced to miniature wargaming, including "Chainmail". Kask phoned "Chainmail" author Gary Gygax with some questions about the game, and subsequently met Gygax at the 1974 Gen Con gaming convention in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. At the time, Gygax was co-developing the rules for a new type of role-playing game, and Kask and his friends became one of the first groups of playtesters of what would become "Dungeons & Dragons".
In the games industry.
In 1975, shortly after the original rules to "Dungeons & Dragons" were published by Tactical Studies Rules (soon to become TSR, Inc.), Gygax hired Kask as an editor, the first full-time employee of the new company. Kask’s first assignment was editing, developing, and contributing to the Blackmoor rules supplement. Kask became editor of "The Strategic Review", starting with Issue #5. Kask authorized Paul Jaquays through a casual license to publish "The Dungeoneer" as a fanzine to provide adventures for other Games Masters. In 1976 Kask edited the final three supplementary rules booklets for the original "D&D" rules: "Eldritch Wizardry", "Gods, Demi-gods & Heroes", and "Swords & Spells". Kask’s focus within TSR then changed, as he oversaw the formation of TSR Periodicals. He split "The Strategic Review" into two new periodicals: "The Dragon", devoted to "D&D"; and "Little Wars", devoted to historical board gaming and miniatures play. Kask was the editor of the first 33 issues of "The Dragon" (soon renamed "Dragon Magazine"). Kask developed and edited TSR’s historical board game, "William the Conqueror, 1066", and was responsible for starting the "Days of the Dragon" line of calendars. During the development of "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" and "Basic Dungeons & Dragons" in the late 1970s, Kask helped Gygax delineate the differences between the two game systems.
Kask was responsible for hiring a number of people at TSR who subsequently went on to become influential creators in the role-playing game industry, including Kim Mohan.
Kask resigned from TSR in 1980. He stayed in the games industry for a few years, re-developing "Naval War" for Avalon Hill in late 1981. He also started up Manzakk Publishing and became publisher and editor of "Adventure Gaming" magazine.
After TSR.
Kask left the games industry in 1983 to do freelance editing, ghost-writing, and speech-writing. He went back to school in 2002, and after earning a Master’s degree in Education from Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, he became a teacher.
In 2006 Kask was a celebrity auctioneer, with Frank Mentzer, at Gen Con Indy. He joined Mentzer as a special guest at the Lake Geneva Gaming Convention in 2007 and 2008.
Jim Ward, a fellow TSR employee in the early days of the company, who had become managing editor of "The Crusader" magazine, persuaded Kask to write a monthly column for his magazine.
At the KC Game Fair in November 2010, Kask announced his return to the games industry as one of the founders (with Mentzer, Jim Ward and Chris Clark) of Eldritch Enterprises. The company publishes a variety of general works as well as new creations for role-playing games.
With Ernie and Luke Gygax, and several others, Kask will be working on Gygax Magazine published by TSR Games, set to debut in December 2012.

She is currently an Assistant Professor of Art at North Park University, where she has received several awards and residencies worldwide, and has been exhibited in several prestigious galleries and museums including the Museum of Art and Design New York and the October Gallery, London.
Okore often uses discarded yet reusable materials such as magazines and newspapers found in the United States. In redeeming these everyday waste and found objects, Okore’s works brings a focus on consumerism, excessive wastefulness, and transformation of materials. Other materials employed in her work include clay, rope, wax, wood, and burlap.
Her revitalizing and reconstructive approach to materials makes Okore one of the most exciting and innovative artists of her generation, working with urban recyclia. Whilst in many ways, her approaches are reflective of recycling values specific to Nigerian society, her concerns are universally resonant.
One of her most famous pieces 'Rope' made from rolls of newspaper wound together and glued was created in 2006, making it a typical recycling piece.

Eldorado Overture

"Eldorado Overture" is the opening track on Electric Light Orchestra's 1974 concept album "Eldorado".
It was a new experience for Jeff Lynne to use a full orchestra and choir for the band's songs. The opening starts with haunting sounds provided by Richard Tandy on the synthesizer. A deep voice (Peter Forbes-Robertson) speaks out the first lyrics of the entire album.
"The dreamer, the unwoken fool,"
"In dreams, no pain will kiss the brow."
"The love of ages fills the head."
"The days that linger there in prey of emptiness,"
"Of burned out dreams."
"The minutes calling through the years."
"The universal dreamer rises up above his earthly burden."
"Journey to the dead of night."
"High on a hill in Eldorado..."
The words fade into an orchestra that opens the concept of the LP, from 1:11 to 2:11. The orchestra slows and segues into the next track "Can't Get It Out of My Head". Since the two tracks fit together well, they were performed together up until the "Time" tour in 1981.
Reviews.
""The first actual experience of having a great big orchestra was the Eldorado Overture and it blew me away. I never write the words to my songs until after I've finished the music. In this case, I wrote the spoken introduction for the actor in the van on the way to the studio.""
Jeff Lynne (2000 - Flashback)
""This was the first time I'd ever used a big orchestra on a record. Up until then it had been two cellos and a violin double-tracked a few times. I was thrilled when the 30-piece struck up on the big intro.""

The Macchi M.12 was a flying boat bomber produced in small numbers in Italy in 1918. It was a conventional design generally similar to an enlarged version of other Macchi designs of the period and featured the Warren truss-style interplane struts that had been introduced on the Macchi M.9. A major difference, however, was its twin-boom fuselage, each with a separate tail-fin. An M.12 was entered in the Schneider Trophy race of 1920, but did not compete.

SK Hand Tools

S-K Hand Tools is a tool company located in Sycamore, Illinois. Major products include sockets and drive tools, wrenches, air tools, and other mechanics' tools. The company has a tool line of over 3,500 items including wrenches, ratchets, screwdrivers, tool boxes and air tools. It has manufacturing facilities in Sycamore, Illinois. Outlets for their products include independent tool-truck dealers, auto parts stores, and major internet vendors such as Sears and Amazon.com.
Jay Leno described SK as "an iconic American brand for decades," and the company is known for inventing the round-head ratchet wrench.
History.
SK was founded as the Sherman-Klove Company, specializing in screw-machine products, by Mason H. Sherman and Noah Grover Klove. The company was founded in the early 1900s to supply munitions in WWI, and made mortar housings in a screw machine plant on Harrison Street in Chicago. During the 1920s SK operated primarily as a contract company, making tools for other brands (including Craftsman). Business thrived, they made specialty screw machine products that did well until the depression. William S. Sherman (W.S.), Mason's son, came to SK after graduating college in 1927 and was eventually a major owner of the company. One of the products the company made was socket wrenches for Hinsdale Socket and Wrench Company. The Hinsdale Company went out of business during the great depression leaving Sherman-Klove with a large inventory of this product, they then redesigned the product and changed the company name to S-K Tools.
Theodore Rueb, an engineer for the Sherman-Klove Company, went on to developed a new mechanism for a very successful line of ratchets, scaled from 1/4-drive up to 3/4-drive. The "round-head" ratchet has remained one of the most popular ratchet styles in the seven decades since S-K's first development, and many modern ratchets are little changed from the earliest design. SK invented the round-head ratchet wrench in 1933 and received a patent for it the following year, which remains a mainstay of their, and every major competitor's product line today.
In 1962, SK, along with manufacturing partner Lectrolite Corp., of Defiance, OH was bought out by Symington-Wayne. That company was later bought out by Snap-On Tools. In 1985 SK became part of Facom Tools. In June, 2010, the company declared bankruptcy. On August 23, 2010, it was announced that two days later, on August 25, 2010, Ideal Industries would acquire SK.

The Abbott and Costello Cartoon Show

The Abbott and Costello Cartoon Show is an American half-hour animated series of the famous comedy duo that aired in syndication from September 9, 1967 to June 1, 1968. Each of the 39 individual episodes consisted of four five-minute cartoons. The cartoons were created jointly by Hanna-Barbera, RKO General and Jomar Productions between 1965 and 1967. The series was syndicated by Gold Key Entertainment and King World Productions.
The primary feature of this cartoon series was the fact that Bud Abbott supplied the voice for his own character. Stan Irwin provided the voice of Lou Costello, who had died in 1959. The rest of the voice cast was composed of Hanna-Barbera regulars. The Canadian cartoonist, Lynn Johnston, who is famous for her comic strip, "For Better or For Worse", was an uncredited cel colorist.
Production.
"Abbott and Costello" was among the animated programs of the 1960s that were based on the decade's nostalgia craze which animated other comedy teams of the past such as "Laurel and Hardy" and "The New Three Stooges". The show created work for the ill and impoverished Bud Abbott who provided the voice of his animated character. Lou Costello had died in 1959 and had his voiced supplied by the nightclub manager Stan Irwin who was a close friend of the duo.
Comic book series.
A comic book based on the TV show was produced by Charlton Comics. Starting in February 1968, it ran for 22 issues, ending in August 1971.
Reception.
Hal Erickson, author of "Television Cartoon Shows, An Illustrated Encyclopedia" gave the program a negative review, stating that "Abbott and Costello" episodes were difficult to tell apart. Erickson stated that "virtually every one them features the tubby Costello being pursued by some bugeyed monster or giant sized garden pest" and that "None of the classic verbal exchanges which brought the real Abbott and Costello to fame in the first place are evident."
Home Video releases.
An episode of the show will be on the The Best of Warner Bros.: Hanna Barbera 25 Cartoon Collection DVD set and will be released on May 21, 2013.

Preston Ridlehuber

Howard Preston Ridlehuber (born November 2, 1943 in Greenwood, South Carolina) is a former American collegiate and Professional Football running back in the NFL and the American Football League (AFL). He played one season each for the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and the AFL's Oakland Raiders and Buffalo Bills. He was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the 11th round, pick 166 overall, in the 1966 NFL draft and by the New York Jets in the 19th round, pick 168 overall, of the 1966 AFL draft. 
Ridlehuber is best known for scoring a touchdown with 33 seconds remaining in a game against the New York Jets, by recovering a fumbled kickoff. It occurred in the Heidi Game, and was not seen by television viewers because NBC switched from football coverage to the 1968 film "Heidi". The Heidi Game or Heidi Bowl as it is also known led to a change in the way professional football is televised on network television; games are now shown to their conclusion before evening programming begins.
His most notable Buffalo Bills highlight came during a game against the 0–5 then called Boston Patriots. Preston was a backup running back with the 2–3 Bills. O.J. Simpson had been concussed in Houston the week before and was not dressed for the Patriots game. Fullback Wayne Patrick (number 30) had run 17 times for 131 yards. Max Anderson (number 22) also known as Mini Max Anderson had 10 carries for 46 yards. 
Mini Max was injured during a collision on the field. His face mask shattered and Anderson's teeth were broken and lying on the turf. While medical personnel were administering to Max, Bill's coach John Rauch called for Preston along the sideline. The score was tied 16–16 late in the 4th quarter. Rauch knelt down and drew a play out in the dirt. The play, a halfback option play, had been practiced for the last couple of weeks. It was originally planned for O.J. to throw a short pass to the Tight end. The Bills were in a short yardage situation, and this pass completion would keep the drive alive.
Preston took the play into the huddle and the play was set in motion. On the snap, Ridlehuber who had been a quarterback at Georgia, noticed that the Patriots cornerback was closing in on the Tight end. His better judgement told him, to look elsewhere for an available receiver. He then saw Bills wide receiver Haven Moses wide open. He tossed a pass to the open Moses and he scored a touchdown on the long 45-yard pass completion. 
When he returned to the bench, Coach Rauch congratulated him, and said: 'Be glad it worked.' The play gave the Bills a 23–16 lead. This touchdown stood up and was the final score. Notably, during that game, his regular jersey number (37) was ripped; as such, a replacement jersey with the number 31 was given to him to wear instead. The number 31 was retired for most of the team's history to represent a generic player and the "spirit of the franchise;" Ridlehuber would be the only player to wear the number for the Bills until it was unceremoniously put back into circulation in 1991.
Preston now is Honorary Commissioner of the Preston Ridlehuber Football League. This fantasy football league has been in existence since 1991 and is named as a tribute to a man who made great plays before and after his time with the Buffalo Bills. A career-ending injury prevented the world from enjoying Preston's contributions on the field.
Education.
Ridlehuber is a graduate of Gainesville High School in Gainesville, Georgia where he was an all-around athlete in football, baseball, basketball and track. He received All-State honors as a baseball pitcher and football quarterback. He then attended the University of Georgia where he played quarterback on the football team rather than sign as a pitcher with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He won the C.M. Hendricks MVP award in the 1964 Sun Bowl where Georgia defeated Texas Tech. He was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity at Georgia.

Redlich–Kwong equation of state

In physics and thermodynamics, the Redlich–Kwong equation of state is an empirical, algebraic equation that relates temperature, pressure, and volume of gases. It is generally more accurate than the van der Waals equation and the ideal gas equation at temperatures above the critical temperature. It was formulated by Otto Redlich and Joseph Neng Shun Kwong in 1949. It showed that a two-parameter, cubic equation of state could well reflect reality in many situations, standing alongside the much more complicated Beattie–Bridgeman model and Benedict–Webb–Rubin equation that were used at the time. The Redlich–Kwong equation has undergone many revisions and modifications, in order to either improve its accuracy in terms of predicting gas-phase properties of more compounds, as well as in better simulating conditions at lower temperatures, including vapor-liquid equilibria.
Equation.
The Redlich–Kwong equation is formulated as: 
where:
The constants are different depending on which gas is being analyzed. The constants can be calculated from the critical point data of the gas:
where:
The Redlich–Kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the critical pressure (reduced pressure) is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the critical temperature (reduced temperature):
The Redlich–Kwong equation can also be represented as an equation for the compressibility factor of a gas, as a function of temperature and pressure:
where:
This equation only implicitly gives Z as a function of pressure and temperature, but is easily solved numerically, originally by graphical interpolation, or now, more easily by computer.
For all Redlich–Kwong gases:
where:
From the Redlich–Kwong equation, the fugacity coefficient of a gas can be estimated:
The Redlich–Kwong equation was developed with an intent to also be applicable to mixtures of gases. In a mixture, the "b" term, representing the volume of the molecules, is an average of the b values of the components, weighted by the mole fractions:
where:
The constant representing the attractive forces, "a", is not linear with respect to mole fraction, but rather depends on the square of the mole fractions. That is:
where:
It is generally assumed that the attractive cross terms are the geometric average of the individual "a" terms, that is:
In this case, the following equation for the attractive term is furnished:
where Ai is the "A" term for the "i"'th component of the mixture.
History.
The Van der Waals equation, formulated in 1873 by Johannes Diderik van der Waals, is generally regarded as the first somewhat realistic equation of state (beyond the ideal gas law):
However, its modeling of real behavior is not sufficient for many applications, and by 1949, had fallen out of favor, with the Beattie-Bridgeman and Benedict-Webb-Rubin equations of state being used preferentially, both which contain more parameters than the Van der Waals equation. The Redlich–Kwong equation was developed by Redlich and Kwong while they were both working for the Shell Development Company at Emeryville, California. Kwong had begun working at Shell in 1944, where he met Otto Redlich when he joined the group in 1945. The equation arose out of their work at Shell - they wanted an easy, algebraic way to relate the pressures, volumes, and temperatures of the gasses they were working with - mostly non-polar and slightly polar hydrocarbons (the Redlich–Kwong equation is less accurate for hydrogen-bonding gasses). It was presented jointly in Portland, Oregon at the "Symposium on Thermodynamics and Molecular Structure of Solutions" in 1948, as part of the 14th Meeting of the American Chemical Society. The success of the Redlich–Kwong equation in modeling many real gasses accurately demonstrate that a cubic, two-parameter equation of state can give adequate results, if it is properly constructed. After they demonstrated the viability of such equations, many others created equations of similar form to try to improve on the results of Redlich and Kwong.
Derivation.
The equation is essentially empirical - the derivation is neither direct nor rigorous. The Redlich–Kwong equation is very similar to the Van der Waals equation, with only a slight modification being made to the attractive term, giving that term a temperature dependence. At high pressures, the volume of all gases approaches some finite volume, largely independent of temperature, that is related to the size of the gas molecules. This volume is reflected in the "b" in the equation. It is empirically true that this volume is about 0.26Vc (where Vc is the volume at the critical point). This approximation is quite good for many small, non-polar compounds – the value ranges between about 0.24Vc and 0.28Vc. In order for the equation to provide a good approximation of volume at high pressures, it had to be constructed such that
The first term in the equation represents this high-pressure behavior.
The second term corrects for the attractive force of the molecules to each other. The functional form of "a" with respect to the critical temperature and pressure is empirically chosen to give the best fit at moderate pressures for most relatively non-polar gasses.
Modification.
The Redlich–Kwong equation was designed largely to predict the properties of small, non-polar molecules in the vapor phase, which it generally does well. However, it has been subject to various attempts to refine and improve it. In 1975, Redlich himself published an equation of state adding a third parameter, in order to better model the behavior of both long-chained molecules, as well as more polar molecules. His 1975 equation was not so much a modification to the original equation as a re-inventing of a new equation of state, and was also formulated so as to take advantage of computer calculation, which was not available at the time the original equation was published. Many others have offered competing equations of state, either modifications to the original equation, or equations quite different in form. It was recognized by the mid 1960s that to significantly improve the equation, the parameters, especially "a", would need to become temperature dependent. As early as 1966, Barner noted that the Redlich–Kwong equation worked best for molecules with an acentric factor (ω) close to zero. He therefore proposed a modification to the attractive term:
where
It soon became desirable to obtain an equation that would also model well the Vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) properties of fluids, in addition to the vapor-phase properties. Perhaps the best known application of the Redlich–Kwong equation was in calculating gas fugacities of hydrocarbon mixtures, which it does well, that was then used in the VLE model developed by Chao and Seader in 1961. However, in order for the Redlich–Kwong equation to stand on its own in modeling vapor-liquid equilibria, more substantial modifications needed to be made. The most successful of these modifications is the Soave modification to the equation, proposed in 1972. Soave's modification involved replacing the T1/2 power found in the denominator attractive term of the original equation with a more complicated temperature-dependent expression. He presented the equation as follows:
where
The Peng–Robinson equation of state further modified the Redlich–Kwong equation by modifying the attractive term, giving
the parameters "a", "b", and "α" are slightly modified, with
The Peng-Robinson equation typically gives similar VLE equilibria properties as the Soave modification, but often gives better estimations of the liquid phase density.
Several modifications have been made that attempt to more accurately represent the first term, related to the molecular size. The first significant modification of the repulsive term beyond the Van der Waals equation's
(where Phs represents a hard spheres equation of state term.) was developed in 1963 by Thiele:
where
This expression was improved by Carnahan and Starling to give 
The Carnahan-Starling hard-sphere equation of state has term been used extensively in developing other equations of state, and tends to give very good approximations for the repulsive term.
Beyond improved two-parameter equations of state, a number of three parameter equations have been developed, often with the third parameter depending on either Zc, the compressibility factor at the critical point, or ω, the acentric factor. Schmidt and Wenzel proposed an equation of state with an attractive term that incorporates the acentric factor:
formula_28
This equation reduces to the original Redlich–Kwong equation in the case when ω = 0, and to the Peng-Robinson equation when ω = 1/3.

David Pratt (cricketer)

David Pratt (born 20 July 1938) is a former English cricketer who played first-class cricket between 1959 and 1962 for three different teams. He also played minor counties cricket for Hertfordshire. He was a specialist bowler, whose batting was extremely poor: indeed, in his first 14 first-class innings his highest score was 3 not out, and he only ever reached double figures twice.
He made his first-class debut for Worcestershire in May 1959 against Derbyshire at Chesterfield, but took no wickets.
He did not play in the first-team again until early August, when Worcestershire played Surrey at Worcester, but he then produced what was to remain a career-best performance. After going wicketless in the first innings, second time around he took 5-54, all his victims being current or future Test cricketers: Micky Stewart, Ken Barrington, Eric Bedser, Jim Laker and Alec Bedser.
He stayed in the team throughout August, but took only eight more wickets in six games. In 1960 he played no cricket at all, but in 1961, by now in the Army, he turned out on three occasions for Combined Services against Nottinghamshire and Northamptonshire as well as a touring South Africa Fezelas side, taking six wickets in all. He returned to county cricket in 1962 with Nottinghamshire, playing seven first-class games (in which he took just four wickets) but otherwise being confined to the Second XI. Reflecting the start of his career, in his final match (against Gloucestershire) both his victims were Test players: Arthur Milton and David Smith.

Earl Christy

'Earl Oliver Christy' (born March 19, 1943 in Perryman, Maryland) is a former professional American football player who played cornerback for three seasons for the New York Jets.
College.
Earl “The Twirl" Christy better known by friends as "The Super Bowl Champ" or "Mr. Inspiration" was inducted into the Hawk Hall of Fame in 1984. Earl came to Maryland State College (MSC)
from Perryman, Maryland in 1961. Earl attended Havre de Grace Consolidated School in Havre de Grace, Maryland. At the tiny all-
Black school, Earl was known as “All World”. You name it and he did it. In track and field, Earl high jumped 6 feet
and 4 inches and threw the shot put 49 feet and 9 inches. In addition, Earl’s basketball prowess was legendary. He 
had a 40-inch vertical leap and once scored an amazing 43 points in a single game while the opposing losing team scored a total 42 points. Earl was a four-year letterman on 
the Hawks’ football team. During his four-year career, the MSC Hawk football program compiled a record of 17 wins, 
2 ties and 9 losses. Earl, a dean lists student, graduated from MSC in 1967 with a degree in Physical Education.
NFL career.
The New York Jets signed Earl in 1966 to play defensive back, kick off, and punt return specialist. 
Earl played for the N.Y. Jets for 3 years and was one of five Hawks who played in the 1968 Super Bowl (3 Jets and 2 Colts). He played for the New York Jets from 1966 to 1969. He played position of half back and defensive back and during Super Bowl III had a 25 yd kick off return. Earl ended his professional NFL career with 34 punt returns for 222 yards and 58 kick off returns for 1323 yards. Earl was an integral member of the Jets 1968 Super Championship team. 
Earl Christy has the distinction of playing the proverbial bookend to the nadir and zenith of the Jets' moments against 
their most hated 1968 rival, the Oakland Raiders. First, there's the Heidi Game, the extraordinary watershed moment in the history of TV's coverage of professional football. The histrionics of the game itself are well-known: fights, penalties,
ejections, then a little girl trapsing through the Alps. With the Raiders ahead with 1:05 to go, their kickoff went to Earl Christy who fumbled it at the 12 (although he has insisted numerous times - rightfully so - that the ball was actually knocked out of his hands by a team-mate during the play), with the Raiders recovering in the end zone. Raiders 43 Jets 32. This was the nadir.
Then, leap ahead a few weeks later, to Shea Stadium and the AFL Championship against Oakland. 
After the Raiders scored in the fourth quarter to take the lead at 23-20, Christy takes the kickoff and runs it back 32 yards 
to set up a Namath pass to Sauer, followed by Namath's wild throw to Don Maynard, which then set up the clinching touchdown.
Heidi Game.
The 1968 season also saw the Jets involved in one of the most notorious incidents in television history, an incident that would change the way television networks carried sporting events for decades to come. On November 17, 1968, just before 7:30pm Eastern time, the Jets scored late to take a 32–29 lead over the Oakland Raiders with 1:05 left. NBC cut to a commercial, and then everywhere but the West Coast showed the movie "Heidi", a show which NBC had promoted extensively for the sweeps period. Outraged fans bombarded NBC headquarters in New York with phone calls demanding the game be restored; so many phone calls were made that they eventually knocked out the NBC switchboard. Even though a decision was made to carry the game to conclusion, this decision could not be communicated, thus resulting in the movie starting on schedule.
Fans' ire was further fueled when they discovered that NBC's cutting away from the game denied them from seeing live a dramatic finish. On the Raiders' second play from scrimmage on the next drive, Daryle Lamonica threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to Charlie Smith, giving the Raiders a 36–32 lead. On the ensuing kickoff, Earl Christy of the Jets fumbled at the 10 yard line, which the Raiders' Preston Ridlehuber converted into another touchdown, ultimately giving the Raiders a 43–32 victory. Much of the country learned of this final outcome only via a bottom-of-screen crawl line shown during the movie. This incident, dubbed the Heidi Game, resulted in most television networks and sports leagues amending their television policies to ensure that games in progress would be broadcast to their conclusion, no matter what, even if it meant delaying or canceling the rest of the network's lineup, and even if the game's outcome seemed assured.

Canadians

Canadians (singular Canadian; ) are the people who are identified with the country of Canada. This connection may be residential, legal, historical, and/or cultural. For most Canadians, several (frequently all) of those types of connections exist and are the source(s) of their being considered "Canadians".
Aboriginal peoples, according to the 2011 Canadian Census, numbered at 1,400,685, 4.3% of the country's 33,476,688 population. The majority of the population is made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-aboriginal peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Aboriginal, French, British and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada and thus a Canadian identity. Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States.
Canadian independence from Great Britain grew gradually over the course of many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. World War I and World War II in particular gave rise to a desire amongst Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship. Legislative independence was established with the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931, the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1, 1947, and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in 1982. Canada's nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom. Legislation since the mid 20th century represents Canadians' commitment to multilateralism and socioeconomic development.
Population.
As of 2010 Canadians make up 0.5% of the world's total population, having relied upon immigration for population growth and social development. Approximately 41% of current Canadians are first- or second-generation immigrants, and 20 percent of Canadian residents in the 2000s were not born in the country. Statistics Canada projects that, by 2031, nearly one-half of Canadians above the age of 15 will be foreign-born or have one foreign-born parent.
Immigration.
The French originally settled New France in present-day Quebec and Ontario, during the early part of the 17th century.
Approximately 100 Irish-born families would settle the Saint Lawrence Valley by 1700, assimilating into the "Canadien" population and culture. The French also settled the Acadian peninsula alongside a smaller number of other European merchants, collectively becoming the Acadians. During the 18th and 19th century; immigration westward (to the area known as Rupert's Land) was carried out by "Voyageurs"; French settlers working for the North West Company; and by British settlers (English and Scottish) representing the Hudson's Bay Company, coupled with independent entrepreneurial woodsman called "Coureur des bois". This arrival of newcomers led to the creation of the Métis, an ethnic group of mixed European and First Nations parentage.
The British conquest of New France was preceded by a small number of Germans and Swedes who settled alongside the Scottish in Port Royal, Nova Scotia, while some Irish immigrated to the Colony of Newfoundland. In the wake of the 1775 invasion of Canada by the newly formed Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, approximately 60,000 United Empire Loyalist fled to British North America, a large portion of whom migrated to New Brunswick. After the War of 1812, British (including British army regulars), Scottish and Irish immigration was encouraged throughout Rupert's Land, Upper Canada and Lower Canada.
Between 1815 and 1850, some 800,000 immigrants came to the colonies of British North America, mainly from the British Isles as part of the great migration of Canada. These new arrivals included some Gaelic-speaking Highland Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances to Nova Scotia. The Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s significantly increased the pace of Irish immigration to Prince Edward Island and the Province of Canada, with over 35,000 distressed individuals landing in Toronto in 1847 and 1848. Beginning in late 1850s, the immigration of Chinese into the Colony of Vancouver Island and Colony of British Columbia peaked with the onset of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. The Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 eventually placed a head tax on all Chinese immigrants, in hopes of discouraging Chinese immigration after completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway.
The population of Canada has consistently risen, doubling approximately every 40 years, since the establishment of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. From the mid- to late 19th century, Canada had a policy of assisting immigrants from Europe, including an estimated 100,000 unwanted "Home Children" from Britain. Block settlement communities were established throughout western Canada between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some were planned and others were spontaneously created by the settlers themselves. Canada was now receiving a large number of European immigrants, predominately Italians, Germans, Scandinavians, Dutch, Poles, and Ukrainians.
Legislative restrictions on immigration (such as the Continuous journey regulation and Chinese Immigration Act) that had favoured British and other European immigrants were amended in the 1960s, opening the doors to immigrants from all parts of the world. While the 1950s had still seen high levels of immigration by Europeans, by the 1970s, immigrants were increasingly Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese, Jamaican and Haitian. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Canada received many American Vietnam War draft dissenters. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Canada's growing Pacific trade brought with it a large influx of South Asians, who tended to settle in British Columbia. Immigrants of all backgrounds tend to settle in the major urban centres.
The majority of illegal immigrants come from the southern provinces of the People's Republic of China, with Asia as a whole, Eastern Europe, Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East all contributing to the illegal population. Estimates of numbers of illegal immigrants range between 35,000 and 120,000. A 2008 report by the Auditor General of Canada Sheila Fraser stated that Canada has lost track of approximately 41,000 illegal immigrants whose visas have expired.
Citizenship and diaspora.
Canadian citizenship is typically obtained by birth in Canada, birth abroad when at least one parent is a Canadian citizen, or by adoption abroad by at least one Canadian citizen. It can also be granted to a permanent resident who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements. Canada established its own nationality law in 1946 with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act which took effect on January 1, 1947. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C-11, which replaced the Immigration Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration. Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship, Canada's naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of 1910.
According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, there are three main classifications for immigrants: "Family class" (persons closely related to Canadian residents), "Economic class" (admitted on the basis of a point system that accounts for age, health and labour-market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada's labour market) and "Refugee class" (those seeking protection by applying to remain in the country by way of the Canadian immigration and refugee law). In 2008, there were 65,567 immigrants in the family class, 21,860 refugees, and 149,072 economic immigrants amongst the 247,243 total immigrants to the country. Canada resettles over one in 10 of the world’s refugees and has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world.
As of a 2010 report by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, there were 2.8 million Canadian citizens abroad. This represents about 8% of the total Canadian population. Of those living abroad, the United States, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, China, and Lebanon have the largest Canadian diaspora. Canadians in the United States constitute the greatest single expatriate community at over 1 million in 2009, representing 35.8% of all Canadians abroad. Under current Canadian law, Canada does not restrict dual citizenship but Passport Canada encourages its citizens to travel abroad on their Canadian passport, so they can access Canadian consular services.
Ethnic ancestry.
Canada has 34 ethnic groups with at least 100,000 members each, of which 11 have over 1 million people and numerous others are represented in smaller amounts. According to the 2006 census, the largest self-reported ethnic origin is "Canadian" (32%), followed by English (21%), French (15.8%), Scottish (15.1%), Irish (13.9%), German (10.2%), Italian (4.6%), Chinese (4.3%), North American Indian (4.0%), Ukrainian (3.9%), and Dutch (Netherlands) (3.3%).
In the 2006 census, over five million Canadians identified themselves as a member of a visible minority. Together, they make up 16.2% of the total population: most numerous among these are South Asian (4.0%), Black (2.5%), and Filipino (1.1%). Aboriginal peoples are not considered a visible minority under the Employment Equity Act, and this is the definition that Statistics Canada also uses.
Culture.
Canada's culture is a product of its ethnicities, languages, religions, political and legal system(s). Being a settler nation, Canada has been shaped by waves of migration that have combined to form a unique blend of art, cuisine, literature, humour and music. Today, Canada has a diverse makeup of nationalities and constitutional protection for policies that promote multiculturalism rather than cultural assimilation. In Quebec, cultural identity is strong, and many French-speaking commentators speak of a Quebec culture as distinguished from English Canadian culture. However, as a whole, Canada is a cultural mosaic: a collection of several regional, aboriginal, and ethnic subcultures.
Canadian government policies such as official bilingualism; publicly funded health care; higher and more progressive taxation; outlawing capital punishment; strong efforts to eliminate poverty; strict gun control; leniency in regard to drug use, and, most recently, legalizing same-sex marriage are social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. American media and entertainment are popular, if not dominant, in English Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the United States and worldwide. The Government of Canada has also influenced culture with programs, laws and institutions. It has created Crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media and has also tried to protect Canadian culture by setting legal minimums on Canadian content.
Canadian culture has historically been influenced by Aboriginal, French and British cultures and traditions. Most of Canada's territory was inhabited and developed later than other European colonies in the Americas, with the result that themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders were important in the early development of the Canadian identity. First Nations played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The British conquest of New France in the mid-1700s brought a large Francophone population under British Imperial rule, creating a need for compromise and accommodation. The new British rulers left alone much of the religious, political, and social culture of the French-speaking "habitants", guaranteeing through the Quebec Act of 1774 the right of the "Canadiens" to practise the Catholic faith and to use French civil law (now Quebec law).
The Constitution Act of 1867 was designed to meet the growing calls of Canadians for autonomy from British rule, while avoiding the overly strong decentralization that contributed to the Civil War in the United States. The compromises made by the Fathers of Confederation set Canadians on a path to bilingualism, and this in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity.
The Canadian Forces and overall civilian participation in the First World War and Second World War helped to foster Canadian nationalism, however in 1917 and 1944 conscription crisis's highlighted the considerable rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and Francophones. As a result of the First and Second World Wars, the Government of Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority. With the gradual loosening of political ties to the United Kingdom and the modernization of Canadian immigration policies, 20th-century immigrants with African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture. The multiple-origins immigration pattern continues today with the arrival of large numbers of immigrants from non-British or non-French backgrounds.
Multiculturalism in Canada was adopted as the official policy of the government during the premiership of Pierre Elliot Trudeau in the 1970s and 1980s. The Canadian government has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration. Multiculturalism is administered by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and reflected in the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act and section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Religion.
Canada as a nation is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of groups, beliefs and customs. The preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms references "God", and the monarch carries the title of "Defender of the Faith". However Canada has no official religion, and support for religious pluralism (Freedom of religion in Canada) is an important part of Canada's political culture. With Christianity on decline, having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life; commentators have suggested that Canada has come to enter a post-Christian period in a secular state, with irreligion in Canada on the rise. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and within the state.
The 2011 Canadian census reported that 67.3% of Canadians identify as being Christians; of this number, Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7 percent of the population. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians); followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). About 23.9% of Canadians declare no religious affiliation, including agnostics, atheists, humanists, and other groups. The remaining are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which is Islam (3.2%), followed by Hinduism (1.5%), Sikhism (1.4%), Buddhism (1.1%), and Judaism (1.0%).
Before the arrival of European colonists and explorers, First Nations followed a wide array of mostly animistic religions. During the colonial period, the French settled along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River, specifically Latin Rite Roman Catholics, including a number of Jesuits dedicated to converting Aboriginals; an effort that eventually proved successful. The first large Protestant communities were formed in the Maritimes after the British conquest of New France, followed by American Protestant settlers displaced by the American Revolution. The late nineteenth century saw the beginning of a substantive shift in Canadian immigration patterns. Large numbers of Irish and Southern Europeans immigrants were creating new Roman Catholic communities in English Canada. The settlement of the west brought significant Eastern Orthodox immigrants from Eastern Europe and Mormon and Pentecostal immigrants from the United States.
The earliest documentation of Jewish presence in Canada occurs in the 1754 British Army records from the French and Indian War. In 1760, General Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst attacked and won Montreal for the British. In his regiment there were several Jews, including four among his officer corps, most notably Lieutenant Aaron Hart who is considered the father of Canadian Jewry. The Islamic, Sikh, Hindu and Buddhist communities, although small, are as old as the nation itself. The 1871 Canadian Census (first "Canadian" national census) indicated thirteen Muslims among the populace, with approximately 5000 Sikh by 1908. The first Canadian mosque was constructed in Edmonton, in 1938, when there were approximately 700 Muslims in Canada. Buddhism first arrived in Canada when Japanese immigrated during the late 19th century. The first Japanese Buddhist temple in Canada was built in Vancouver in 1905. The influx of immigrants in the late 20th century, with Sri Lankan, Japanese, Indian and Southeast Asian customs, has contributed to the recent expansion of the Sikh, Hindu and Buddhist communities.
Languages.
A multitude of languages are used by 35 million Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians respectively. In 2011, nearly 6.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,072,555 first-language speakers), Punjabi (430,705), Spanish (410,670), German (409,200), and Italian (407,490). Less than one percent of Canadians (just over 250,000 individuals) can speak an aboriginal language. About half this number (129,865) reported using an aboriginal language on a daily basis.
English and French are recognized by the Constitution of Canada as official languages. Thus all federal government laws are enacted in both English and French with government services available in both languages. Two of Canada's territories give official status to indigenous languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government. In the Northwest Territories, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and Tłįchǫ. Multicultural media are widely accessible across the county and offer specialty television channels, newspapers and other publications in many minority languages.
In Canada, as elsewhere in the world of European colonies, the frontier of European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures using different languages met and interacted. The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade, and (in some cases) intermarriage, led to the development of Mixed languages. Languages like Michif, Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language.

Dizz Knee Land

"Dizz Knee Land" is the debut single by Los Angeles-based alternative rock group dada. It was the first single taken from their debut album titled, "Puzzle". "Dizz Knee Land" proved to be very successful for the band upon its release in 1992, reaching number 5 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart, and number 27 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.
Meaning.
This is what bassist Joie Calio had to say on the Westwood One radio program On The Edge: 
The song isn't about Disneyland at all. It's not about Disneyland. It... has nothing to do with Disneyland, actually. It has more to do with the craziness of the juxtaposition of the state of your every day. Just looking around you. You could see a guy's head being chopped off and, you know, a leg flying away and someone embracing someone in a lovely kiss and then flip the channel and then a chainsaw goes buzzing through, you know, some butter and it accidentally cuts your mom's head off and then you flip again and they're making love and then you flip again and it's Montana going 'I'm going to Disneyland'. You know, it's just that whole thing, how insane it is, but you know, it's just the natural state. I don't think we're making a, we're not pointing our fingers. We're just... it just is, and we're just singin' it.
Joie said this about the song in a Chicago Sun-Times interview: "It's our best-known song, but it's not our best song. I got the idea for the song in a dream where I saw this word "Disneyland" on a bus. I heard the melody and then I woke up, wrote it all down and called Mike up to finish it up." [http://www.dadadiscography.net/ditties/dkl.htm]
Music video.
The music video for the song mostly features the band playing on an empty stage. During the video, there are several shots of several random objects moving. Some of these objects include leaves, hard candy, nuts and bolts, rusty tools and a flatiron. This technique has been used before in the music video for Peter Gabriel's "Sledgehammer".

Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre

Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre (MNH), ("Museum of Nature and Man" in English), is a museum based in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Tenerife, (Canary Islands, Spain). It contains many significant archaeological finds and is considered the best repository of objects from the Prehispanic Canary Islands. The museum also houses significant paleontological, botanical, entomological and marine and terrestrial vertebrate collections, in an excellent state of preservation, and is considered the best Natural Library of the Canary Islands.
The museum also integrates the Archaeological Museum of Tenerife, the Bioantropología's Canary Institute and the Museum of Natural Sciences of Tenerife. The museum is located in the downtown area of Santa Cruz, in the former Civil Hospital, a building that constitutes an example of the neoclassical architecture of Canary Islands. The archaeological section was founded in 1958.
The museum holds the largest collection on the culture of the Guanche and also has one of the most modern methods of presentation of mummies, (announced in 2006 by the Cabildo de Tenerife through a communique). It is also an internationally renowned museum and has participated in international meetings on archeology, but its fame is mainly due to its formidable collection of Guanche mummies. In 1992 the Museum of Nature and Man participated in an international research project on mummies (called PROJECT CRONOS), with a global exhibition of mummies. For this reason, the Museum of Nature and Man is a world reference in regard to preservation of mummies.
Foreign television companies such as the American JWM Productions (Discovery Channel) and NHK (Nippon Hoso Kyokai) have filmed documentaries on mummies in the museum. It is also regarded as the most important museum of Macaronesia.
History.
Founded in 1958 with funds from the Section of Archeology and Anthropology Museum of the City of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, its first director was Luis Diego Cuscoy, who brought together a unique collection of archaeological material and human remains from the prehistory of Tenerife. During the sixties, funds were raised to add to the collections, including ethnographic and archeological materials from Africa and Pre-Columbian America. At present the museum exhibits prehistoric archaeological remains both from Tenerife and the rest of the Canary Islands as well as other cultures.
Permanent exhibitions.
On permanent exhibition is a gallery dedicated to the archaeology and the funeral rituals of the aboriginal world. Displayed are the museums collection of skeletal and mummified remaims of the original inhabitants of the Canary Islands, along with objects buried in the tombs of the guanche kings (Menceyes). One of the best preserved mummies is that of the "Mummy of San Andrés".
The museum also exhibits a fine collection of ceramics and fossils of prehistoric animals both of Canaries and of the rest of the world, such as the giant lizard of Tenerife ("Gallotia goliath"), the Tenerife Giant Rat ("Canariomys bravoi") and a megalodon shark tooth.
Featured Pieces.
The museum features a formidable collection of mummies, ornaments, models of aboriginal settlements and pottery. The history ocvered ranges from the beginnings of the Guanche culture to the Conquest of the Canary Islands. Some of its key parts are:
Participation in projects.
The "Archaeological Museum of Tenerife" took part in the Great Exhibition on mummies in 2010 which was held in Granada (Spain). The exhibition feature pieces from various civilizations and geographical environments including the 8000 year old American "Chinchorro". There was also be a representation of the sarcophagi of Egypt, the arid zones of the Andes, the marshes of Denmark, the "men of the ice" (like the mummy Ötzi), which appear from time to time in the cemeteries of Spanish and Guanche mummies in the museum.

"Karakurizōshi Ayatsuri Sakon" was serialized in the Shueisha magazine "Weekly Shōnen Jump" from 1995 to 1996. The chapters were collected into four "Tankōbon" bound volumes. The manga was adapted into an animated television series by Tokyo Movie Shinsha and broadcast on the satellite network WOWOW from October 8, 1999, to March 31, 2000.
Characters.
Sakon Tachibana: A master puppeteer who likes to travel and solve mysteries along his journeys with his puppet and best friend, Ukon. When he does not have Ukon with him, he is a very timid, humble young boy. However, once he places Ukon on his hand, he develops a careful, quiet, observant and calculating personality. He is displayed as a brilliant young man who can solve any case but feels that sometimes it is best "not to see everything so clearly", and is often underestimated by the criminals because of his young age and occupation as a puppeteer. He is also considered very handsome and cute, despite his young age and is often hit on by older women, much to his embarrassment and annoyance. He often worries whenever Ukon is not with him, considering him as his family, and is shown to have a kind heart and will do his best to help those in need. It has been shown that when he was younger, he was often bullied for liking and playing with puppets and that when he was seven, his father committed suicide after injuring another performer's face on accident.
Ukon: A 100 year old child doll made in the early Meiji era by a famous puppet maker. When Sakon operates him, he appears to come to life, having a very distinct personality that differs drastically from Sakon's reserved, quiet nature (when he holds Ukon); however, the two continue to have a strong sibling like bond. He is loud, talkative, rude, and likes beautiful girls. He tends to jump to conclusions in his deductions of who the criminal is, and becomes irritated if Sakon does not tell him what he is thinking or who he suspects is the criminal, often relying on him to explain his deduction of the crime. He is also the one to inspire confidence in Sakon and the victims of the case they are trying to solve. He also has the ability to allow the souls of the dead to take possession of his body to listen to their final words before their death, which often comes in handy when solving mysteries.
Kaoruko Tachibana: Sakon's aunt from his mother's side and assistant police detective. She often follows Sakon on his journeys so she can meet handsome men and eat delicious food, and believes herself to be a rare beauty. She also often focuses more on the motives of people involved in a crime rather than their alibis and possible method of murder, which she often relies on Sakon for. She insists that Sakon call her "Kaoruko nee-san" rather than "Kaoruko obaa-san" and hits Ukon whenever he insults her or says a careless remark.

The Lake of Sainte-Croix () is a man-made lake that was formed by the construction, between 1971 and 1974 (when it was put into service) of a reinforced-concrete arch dam by the name of Dam of Sainte-Croix (). The reservoir holds a maximum of 761 million cubic metres of water. The dam, which generates 142 million kWh of electricity per year, is 94 metres high, 7.5 metres thick at its base and 3 metres thick at its crest.
