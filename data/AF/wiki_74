Extra Continental regiments and Additional Continental regiments

The Extra Continental regiments and Additional Continental regiments of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) differ from each other and from all other Continental Army infantry regiments by the manner in which they formed. The six Extra Continental regiments, which were authorized by Congress and organized in late 1775 to mid-1776, are distinct by having formed without any administrative connection to an individual state. The 16 Additional Continental regiments were approved by Congress as a separate group on December 27, 1776, specifically in response to a request from Gen. George Washington for additional troops, and Congress expressly delegated their formation directly to Washington. All Additional Continental regiments were organized in the spring and summer of 1777. In contrast to both the Extra and Additional regiments, all other infantry regiments of the army were organized and supported under the direct authority of individual state governments (the "line regiments").
Extra Continental regiments.
The six Extra Continental regiments, which are commonly confused with the Additional regiments, are:
Additional Continental regiments.
The 16 Additional Continental regiments formed later and under distinctly different circumstances than those of the Extra Continental regiments. The 1-year enlistments in most Continental Army regiments that formed in the earliest part of the American Revolutionary War expired on December 31, 1776. Therefore, Congress and Washington began preparations for reorganizing the army during that early fall. The reorganization was to apply to troops from every state, and a major factor in the new plan was the decision to recruit for the duration of the war rather than for a single year. Eighty-eight regiments were authorized by a Congressional resolve of September 16, 1776, in which Congress formally outlined the 13 state lines of the Continental Army by specifying the quota of regiments for each state. 
Congress' estimates of the population of each state governed its allocation of regiments, ranging from 15 regiments each from Massachusetts and Virginia to single regiments from Delaware and Georgia. In correspondence to Congress during December 1776, however, Washington pressed for even more men. Central to Washington's position was a recommendation to increase the infantry regiments from the 88 called for in September to a minimum of 110. Congress acted on Washington's request on December 27, 1776, and ruled "That General Washington shall be, and he is hereby, vested with full, ample, and complete powers to raise…from…all of these United States, 16 battalions of infantry, in addition to those already voted by Congress…" 
In contrast to the previously approved 88 regiments, the 16 Additional regiments were organized directly by Washington's authority, rather than by the authority of the state governments, and were placed completely under Washington's control. The resolution gave Washington the requested 110 regiments, for in addition to the 16 new regiments and the 88 units of the September quotas there were the 6 Extra regiments that had been previously approved by Congress and that were also not explicitly tied to a single state. 
The 16 Additional Continental regiments are:
Although Washington wrote to Col. Ezekiel Cornell of Rhode Island and Col. Alexander Scammell of New Hampshire on January 12, 1777, and offered each command of one of the 16 Additional Continental regiments, both declined, and the units never formed.

John D. Schwender

John D. Schwender was a college football coach in the United States. Due to significant injuries to his players during practice, the faculty of his school forced the discontinuation of the football program for one year.
Carroll College.
Schwender was the fifth head college football coach for the Carroll University Pioneers (called "Carroll College" at the time) located in Waukesha, Wisconsin and he held that position for two seasons, from 1899 until 1900 and then returning from 1904 until 1905. His career coaching record at Carroll College was 15 wins, 9 losses, and 2 ties. This ranks him eighth at Carroll College in total wins and eighth at Carroll College in winning percentage.
Discontinuation of 1903.
Carroll college hired Mark D. Nave as head coach after Schwender stepped down. Due to an abundance of injuries during football practice in 1903, the school started to disband the program. Five students were injured in a ten-day period. The incident was deemed so severe that the school chose to forbid the game. The decision was made after voting first by the football team and then of the students of the college. At first, both the players and students voted to keep playing against the wishes of the faculty. The student body eventually gave in to the faculty demands and the team was forced to disband.
The team reorganized and play picked back up for the next season in 1904 with coach Schwender taking over as head coach.

Arab International Women's Forum

AIWF (short for" Arab International Women's Forum") (Arabic: منتدى العالمي للنساء العربيات ) is a London-based umbrella organisation which brings together 1,500 associations, individuals, corporations and partnerships from 45 different nations spanning 6 continents.
Aims.
The aims of AIWF is to give Arab women the equal rights as men both in the workforce and in society, in modesty.
By allowing women to educate themselves and give them more access to computers, technology and university scholarships they can achieve business, educational and governmental roles.
It shows women their potential in business and trade, something the Middle East is known for.
Haifa Fahoum Al Kaylani.
As Founder and Chairwoman of the Forum, Haifa Fahoum Al Kaylani is working hard to give Arab women a voice in the outer society. She began with the vision of putting to help Arab women become "part and parcel of the international community."
She then hastily began to put together a 'formal network of Arab and international businesswomen as well as female community leaders to expand the growing role of women in the global marketplace and decision-making'.
Al Kaylani is also member of the Suzanne Mubarak Women's International Peace Movement and is also a member of the Women's Leadership Board at the Harvard University.
Progession in Society.
Since establishment the organisation has put Arab women in a more comfortable position. Governments, institutes and charities have recognised the work while other groups have supported the group as partners and associates.
One idea is that women are given educational and working opportunities meaning that they will be able to make their mark in society as a whole and as individuals. Part of a 2005 report, AIWF suggested that Arab men be given paternal leave from work to look after children rather than leaving all the work to women, through role balancing.
Work.
AIWF has been acclaimed for 'building bridges and breaking the barriers'. They have made it possible for so many women to get education, jobs and high-status roles in society and allowing them to 'help themselves'.
Businesses and organisations have been able to contact and associate with people in their same position located in other countries. Arab women residing in Britain and Europe can now make business engagements with ladies in the Middle East giving them more potential for business and community work and profit.

Burjiko

A Burjiko (also Burjico, Burjik and Burjic) is a Somali-style cooker or charcoal burning stove. It is used to prepare a variety of foods.
Production and distribution.
The burjiko is made from sepiolite mined from Somalia's central district of El Buur.
The cooking instrument itself parallels in function those found in the Western world. Due to its portability, it is widely used in the Horn of Africa and Southwestern Asia; especially by nomads. 
Description and usage.
The burjiko is circular in shape, with a deep hole running through its center where charcoal is placed. This hole is covered with different types of dishes, depending on what one wants to cook. For example, when making "canjeero" (Somali flatbread), one uses a flat surfaced dish. A deep dish, however, is preferable when cooking sauce.
Besides canjeero and sauce, burjikos are also often used to prepare pasta and meat dishes such as leg of lamb.

McCormick was also the head basketball coach at St. Norbert from 1934 to 1943 and again during the 1944–45 season, tallying a mark of 62–74. He was one of the more outspoken coaches against the NCAA rule change on "free substitution" in 1953.
Playing career.
Marquette.
McCormick played college football and was a forward on the basketball team at Marquette University. The football teams won a victory over Navy by a score of 21–3 in 1924 and completed a 7–2 record in 1925 under College Football Hall of Fame head coach Frank Murray.
Duluth Eskimos.
After graduation at Marquette, McCormic went on to be a member of the Duluth Eskimos in the NFL.
Coaching career.
St. Norbert.
McCormick coached at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin starting with the 1934 season until the conclusion of the 1942 season. His record with the Green Knights was a total of 32 wins, 26 losses, and 8 ties and included a 7–1 season in 1936. Also at St. Norbert, McCormick was the head basketball coach.
Carroll.
McCormick the 20th head football coach for the Carroll College Pioneers (now called "Carroll University") located in Waukesha, Wisconsin and he held that position for nine seasons, from 1949 until 1957. His career coaching record at Carroll College was 37 wins, 31 losses, and 1 tie. This ranks him fourth at Carroll College in total wins and 11th at Carroll College in winning percentage. Carroll would be his last coaching position as he died in August 1958 before the season began, but the school would later induct him into their "Athletic Hall of Fame" for his contributions to the school and athletic programs. Highlights of his coaching at Caroll included a strong offense in the 1951 season.
McCormick began the 1949 season with twenty eager players that were considered "strong on talent but weak on depth" with team drills beginning in early September 1949. He felt that his most talented team was 1955, a team he called the best Carroll had in ten years. McCormick was selected to coach the "South" team for the 1951 Upper Peninsula All-Star Football exhibition game.
Free substitution.
In 1953, McCormick was outspoken among the small-college football coaches against the idea of "free substitution" in college football. Becoming more common in professional football, the idea paved the way of the "specialist athlete" in college football where one person could focus on one position such as quarterback or punter. For large colleges and professional teams, the idea of free substitution worked well. McCormick pointed out that smaller colleges would suffer under this rule. Free substitution generally prevented a player from returning to gameplay in the same quarter after he was taken out for a substitute and it required either a very large squad that could handle all the substitutions or a highly talented small squad that would not need to substitute.
Personal life.
McCormick was a 1929 graduate of Antigo High School in his hometown of Antigo, Wisconsin.

Geriatric oncology

Geriatric oncology is a branch of medicine that is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the elderly, usually defined as aged 65 and older. This fairly young but increasingly important subspecialty incorporates the special needs of the elderly into the treatment of cancer.
In the last few years, this particular subspecialty has received a lot of attention. A large proportion of the population of developed countries are aging. In the United States, 20% of the population will be older than 65 years of age by the year 2030. Those 85 years and older will be the most rapidly growing group. This is compounded by the fact that the majority of cancer patients will be in this age group. Age in itself is one of the most important risk factors for developing cancer. Currently, 60% of newly diagnosed malignant tumors and 70% of cancer deaths occur in people aged 65 years or older. Many cancers are linked to aging; these include breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, lung, bladder and stomach cancers.
Because most non-pediatric cancer patients are older, there is a saying that all oncologists who are not pediatric oncologists are geriatric oncologists.
Unique concerns of older cancer patients.
For many reasons, older adults with cancer have different needs than younger adults with the disease. For example, older adults: 
Clinical trials usually exclude the elderly, and therefore, guidelines for treatment of cancer were mainly based on the younger population. A lot of research in this area is needed.
Just as a child would see a pediatrician for medical care, an older patient should go to a geriatrician. An older patient with cancer will benefit from the expertise of a Geriatric Oncologist. Older patients have unique needs because of their often complex medical histories, numerous drugs they are taking, their social situations, possible problems with cognitive dysfunction related to age, and general diminution of organ function that occurs naturally in the older population.
Origins.
Dr. Rosemary Yancik first organized a symposium on geriatric oncology sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute on Aging. A 1988 ASCO Presidential Address published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology by Dr. B.J. Kennedy encouraged the study of aging and cancer.
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has played a vital role in promoting the field of geriatric oncology in the United States. B.J. Kennedy, MD was one of the fathers of this field. In the late 1980s, the ASCO Annual Meetings started including educational sessions and presentations pertaining to this field. The Journal of Clinical Oncology started publishing more articles pertaining to geriatric oncology. ASCO has also funded training for oncology fellows.
One of a handful of people around the world who created the field of geriatric oncology during the 1980s was Lodovico Balducci. He was co-editor of the first major medial textbook on the subject, "Geriatric Oncology", published in 1982, and has been honored with the B.J. Kennedy Award for Scientific Excellence in Geriatric Oncology from the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
Training & education programs.
Training programs specifically in the geriatric oncology subspeciality have been established. In the United States, the ASCO Geriatric Oncology Fellowship program was developed with funding from the John A. Hartford Foundation. The American Board of Internal Medicine approved a 3-year combined fellowship training program in medical oncology and geriatrics. Graduates of this program will be eligible to be board certified in both specialties. Some fellows opt to also obtain additional training and certification in hematology as well. 10 institutions were identified and a curriculum was designed and instituted.
An example of a geriatric oncology fellowship training curriculum can be found here.
Internationally, a diploma in geriatric oncology has now been established in France.
The first textbook in the field, Geriatric Oncology, was published by Lodovico Balducci et al. There are now many others.
Geriatric oncology assessment.
Typically, new patients meet with either a geriatric oncologist (or sometimes a medical oncologist and geriatrician separately), a psychosocial professional, and a nutritionist, all of whom work together to provide a comprehensive assessment of the patient’s fitness to withstand the therapy necessary to treat his or her cancer. Following the initial assessment, the team meets to evaluate the patient’s fitness for therapy. The team’s decisions and recommendations are then presented to the patient and his or her family as well as to the patient’s primary physician when appropriate. After these discussions, treatment for the patient’s cancer is initiated.
Organization & societies.
The Geriatric Oncology Consortium is a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing the age based disparities in research, education and treatment in the older adult cancer population. It is leader in developing and conducting research in older adults and providing older adult cancer education to medical professionals, patients, caregivers and the general public.
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has started a geriatric oncology subspeciality. A webpage dedicated to article and resources about geriatric oncology is available.
The World oncology network has established a directory for geriatric oncology to promote this subspeciality.
The International Society of Geriatric Oncology[http://www.siog.org] or Société Internationale d’Oncologie Gériatrique in French, hence the acronym SIOG, was founded in 2000 and was officially registered as a Not-for-profit organisation under the Swiss law in October 2012. SIOG is a multidisciplinary society, including physicians in the fields of oncology and geriatrics, and allied health professionals and has over 1000 members in more than 40 countries around the world.
The major risk factor for cancer is age, and with the aging of the world population, a major epidemiologic challenge is before us.
The goal of SIOG is to foster the development of health professionals in the field of geriatric oncology, in order to optimize treatment of older adults with cancer.
SIOG promotes efforts in 3 strategic directions:
1. Education
- Disseminate knowledge in order to maintain a high common standard of healthcare in older cancer patients
- Integrate geriatric oncology in the curricula for medical and nursing education to ensure a high standard of qualification for healthcare professionals 
- Address the shortage of specialist oncologists/geriatricians & allied health staff in geriatric oncology 
- Increase public awareness of the worldwide cancer in the elderly epidemic
2. Clinical practice 
- Integrate geriatric evaluation (including co morbidities) into oncology decision-making and guidelines 
- Improve the quality of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of older patients with malignancies 
- Address issues of access to care, including the needs of the caregiver 
- Develop interdisciplinary geriatric oncology clinics
3. Research
- Develop, test and disseminate easy screening tools
- Create a clear and operational definition of vulnerability/frailty applicable to oncology 
- Increase the relevance of clinical trials for older patients 
- Improve research in the field of geriatric oncology 
- Promote multidisciplinary, basic/translational research on the interface of aging and cancer

Voltage-sensitive dye

Voltage-sensitive dyes, also known as potentiometric dyes, are dyes which change their spectral properties in response to voltage changes. They are able to provide linear measurements of firing activity of single neurons, large neuronal populations or activity of myocytes. Many physiological processes are accompanied by changes in cell membrane potential which can be detected with voltage sensitive dyes. Measurements may indicate the site of action potential origin, and measurements of action potential velocity and direction may be obtained.
Potentiometric dyes are used to monitor the electrical activity inside cell organelles where it is not possible to insert an electrode, such as the mitochondria. This technology is especially powerful for the study of patterns of
activity in complex multicellular preparations. It also makes possible the
measurement of spatial and temporal variations in membrane potential along the
surface of single cells.
Types of dyes.
Fast-response probes: These are amphiphilic membrane staining dyes which usually have a pair of
hydrocarbon chains acting as membrane anchors and a hydrophilic group which aligns the chromophore
perpendicular to the membrane/aqueous interface. The chromophore is believed to undergo a large
electronic charge shift as a result of excitation from the ground to the excited state and this underlies the
putative electrochromic mechanism for the sensitivity of these dyes to membrane potential. This molecule (dye) intercalates among the lipophilic part of biological membranes. This orientation assures that the excitation induced
charge redistribution will occur parallel to the electric field within the membrane. A change in the
voltage across the membrane will therefore cause a spectral shift resulting from a direct interaction
between the field and the ground and excited state dipole moments.
Slow-response probes: These exhibit potential-dependent changes in their transmembrane distribution which are accompanied by a fluoresence change. Typical slow-response probes include cationic carbocyanines and rhodamines, and ionic oxonols.
Examples.
Commonly used voltage sensitive dyes are substituted aminonaphthylethenylpyridinium (ANEP) dyes, such as di-4-ANEPPS, di-8-ANEPPS, and RH237. Depending on their chemical modifications which change their physical properties they are used for different experimental procedures. They were first described in 1985 by the research group of Leslie Loew. ANNINE-6plus is the latest voltage sensitive dye with fast response (ns response time) and high voltage sensitivity. It has been applied to measure the action potentials of a single t-tubule of cardiomyocytes by Guixue Bu et al. A recent computational study confirmed that the ANEP dyes are affected only by the electrostatic environment and not by specific molecular interactions.
Materials.
The core material for imaging brain activity with voltage-sensitive dyes are the dyes themselves. These voltage-sensitive dyes are lipophilic and preferably localized in membranes with their hydrophobic tails. They are used in applications involving fluorescence or absorption; they are fast acting and are able to provide linear measurements of changes in membrane potential.
A variety of specialized equipment may be used in conjunction with the dyes, and choices in equipment will vary according to the particularities of a preparation. Essentially, equipment will include specialized microscopes and imaging devices, and may include technical lamps or lasers.
Strengths and weaknesses.
Strengths of imaging brain activity with voltage-sensitive dyes include the following abilities:
Weaknesses of imaging brain activity with voltage-sensitive dyes include the following problems:
Uses.
Voltage-sensitive dyes have been used to measure neural activity in several areas of the nervous system in a variety of organisms, including the squid giant axon, whisker barrels of the rat somatosensory cortex, olfactory bulb of the salamander, visual cortex of the cat, optic tectum of the frog, and the visual cortex of the rhesus monkey.

Do Ya/Stay with Me

"Do Ya"/"Stay with Me" is McFly's third single taken from the album "" and was the official "Children in Need" single for 2008. It was released physically on 24 November 2008 and for download on 23 November 2008. "Stay with Me" is a cover of a song by The Faces, and was the main Children in Need single. McFly performed both tracks live on Children in Need 2008 on 14 November 2008. "Do Ya" appears on the international soundtrack to the Brazilian telenovela, "Três Irmãs".
Chart performance.
On 30 November 2008, the single debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 18 after both physical and digital releases of the song was made available. This marked the first time McFly had ever missed the UK top 10. Previously, their lowest-charting single had been "Ultraviolet/The Ballad of Paul K", which peaked at number nine. Not only is it McFly's lowest-charting single, but it is also the lowest-charting Children in Need single to date, peaking lower than Children in Need's 2007 single, "Headlines" by the Spice Girls, which had peaked at number 11 and "Still Figuring Out" by Elliot Minor, which had peaked at No. 17 in 2008. The single then dropped straight down to number 54 the following week and dropped out of the top 100 altogether during its third week. Staying in the chart for only two weeks, this also broke yet another band record as the single is the shortest-lasting one in the UK top 100.
Music video.
The video for "Do Ya" is approximately four minutes long, and was released via their YouTube account and their Myspace page. The video begins in a house, where people gather for Christmas, and start opening their presents, which had a McFly member in it. As soon as the band comes out of the boxes, they begin to play the song. More guests arrive, and soon, Zombies arrive at the house. McFly were scared out at the end of the song, and exited via their McMystery Van and off to the moon.
The video for "Do Ya", along with the Christmas "Radio:ACTIVE" album advert that was recorded at the same time, were controversially refused airplay for being 'too scary' and for the fear of being copied by young viewers (when the McFly members were inside Christmas presents). Eventually, though, it earned airplay on TMF Most Wanted.

<doc id="20042102" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20042102" title="Daisy (doll)">
Daisy (doll)

Daisy Doll was a famous 1970s doll designed by fashion designer Mary Quant.
Design.
Mary Quant's Daisy doll was released in the UK in 1973. With the tag line 'Mary Quant makes Daisy the best dressed doll in the world'
Daisy was manufactured in the 1970s in Hong Kong by Model Toys Ltd, in connection with Flair Toys Ltd. Flair Toys Ltd went out of business in 1980 but Daisy continued to be manufactured until 1983.
Mary Quant's 'symbol' is a Daisy flower, hence her doll's name.
The doll is 23 centimetres (9 inches) tall and there are three different versions of her: "Dizzy Daisy", who has a stiff body and unbendable legs,with just her arms and legs swinging up and down from the hips and shoulders, basic bodied version with bendable legs, as well as the swivelling arms and leg joints, and an active version called "Dashing Daisy", whose body is the most bendable. Her hair colour has ranged from different shades of blond to brunette and red.
Other dolls were manufactured from the same moulds. "Havoc, Super Agent" was released in 1976 and Daisy's best friend "Amy", who was only available by redeeming daisy tokens from Daisy packages.
Clothes.
Daisy's clothes were designed by Mary Quant and there are hundreds of different models. The doll and its accessories were sold in ordinary local shops and children had easy access for their fashination to grow on her.The clothes were cutting edge 70s design, which would be expected of Mary Quant, one of Britains leading fashion designers and inventor of the mini skirt and hot pants. Materials included satin, for long evening gowns and flared pants, stretch jersey nylon/polyester for T-Shirts, Fake 'Fun Fur' for jackets and matching hats, and denim for jeans, waiscoats, hats, skirts and even a 'boiler suit' which was very fashionable at the time. Cotton was used extensively for all manner of outfits, long gypsy style dresses, again highly fashionable, blouses, tabbards, mini dresses etc. And patterns, again, were cutting edge fashion with great use of flowers, stripes and polka dots. Footwear was just as fashionable with platform clogs and sandals in every colour, and Go-Go Boots with the Quant daisy on the side.
House and furniture.
Daisy had her own house, a fold up country cottage with one room divided by a split level floor for the bedroom area, and a sloped roof, printed inside with windows and wallpaper and outside with stone walls, windows and greenery. Furniture included round 1970s-style kitchen table and chairs, white with pedestal bases which were based on the Eero Saarinen 'Tulip' chairs and table, it had a complete set of crockery and cutlery, plus a bowl of flowers, napkins and two paper table cloths. Daisy also had a kitchen sink with orange doors a 'tiled' white back splash and hot water boiler, a stove, again white with orange bottom drawer and set of pans. In the bedroom there is a 'Victorian' range of furniture: a bed made of brass look plastic with two sheets, a pillow and eiderdown in white nylon with pink roses all over, a dressing table with swivel mirror and working (battery) oil lamp, and a wardrobe. These items were originally in brown plastic to represent wood, and then went on to be manufactured in a rich green, the doors of the wardrobe papered in a tiny flower print. The range also included a light pink chaise lounge, a chevral dressing mirror and 'bentwood' style coat and hat stand, a 'Chesterfield' style arm chair with pedestal side table and an 'oil lamp'.
Pets.
Daisy's pets were a dog called Spot, a dalmatian, a black Labrador retriever and a horse called Archie, which can be found in three colours: white with black spots, brown and a palomino.
Booklets.
Every year a new fashion booklet was issued, showing any new Daisy dolls, and all her latest fashions for that year. Each booklet had a theme; the first, in 1973, being called "My Fashion Diary", telling all about Daisy's year and the various outfits she wears each month for various occasions. The 1974 booklet is called "My Round The World Holiday", in which Daisy travels the world, showing off more wonderful outfits designed by Mary Quant. 1975 "My Exiting Life As A reporter", 1976, "I'm Having Fun As A Travel Courier", 1976, "All About My Gift shop", 1977, "My Glamorous Life As A Ballerina".
Each fashion book took you on a journey in Daisy's busy life, they were very educational: "Round The World Diary" having brief descriptions of the countries Daisy visited, they added immense play value to Daisy as children could emulate her travels etc. with their own Daisy doll and outfits.
Later fashions (after these booklets) were named "The Optimum" and "Flair" Ranges.
Associated items.
Sets of Daisy paper dolls were produced in the 1970s including:
A book, "Mary Quant's daisy chain of things to make and do" (ISBN 0001033514) was published by Collins in 1975.

Little Cressingham

Little Cressingham lies south east by road from Great Cressingham, west of Watton and south of Swaffham in the Breckland District of Norfolk. It covers an area of and had a population of 157 in 70 households as of the 2001 census The village is located on the edge of the Stanford Battle Area.
The village is dispersed, with the main centre focused on a crossroads around the church and the mill. The village church is dedicated to St Andrew and is partially ruined. The building is medieval and designated as a Grade I listed building. The village is in the Benefice of Cockley Cley. The round tower Church of All Saints at Threxton lies to the east of the village.
The village pub, The White Horse, closed in 2004. Next to the church is the old Free School founded and endowed by William Farrer in 1809 and built at a cost of £144. It is now the village hall. The mill at Little Cressingham, a Grade II* listed building, is both a water and wind mill, one of only two in Norfolk. It was built in about 1820 on the Clermont Estate and is now disused.
Clermont estate.
The Clermont Estate in Threxton, hamlet near Little Cressingham, was created by the Irish peer William Henry Fortescue (1722–1806), Earl of Clermont, friend of the Prince of Wales. He built Clermont Lodge as a shooting box and it was extended by his nephew and heir William Charles Fortescue (1764–1829), Viscount Clermont.
Following Viscount Clermont's death without issue Clermont Estate was sold to Sir Francis Lyttleton Holyoake Goodricke in 1844 and in 1858 it was purchased by the 2nd Duke of Wellington. In 1863 he conveyed the Hilborough and Clermont Estates to John Remington Mills. In 1869 Mills bought the Watton estate and an outlying farm at Tottenhill in Norfolk. His son Joseph Trueman Mills added the South Pickenham estate, Norfolk.
The last owner of Clermont Hall was Sir Richard Prince-Smith who acquired the estate in 1966 and sold it in 1997. The estate, which originally extended to , was broken up from 1977 onwards. Much of it is now owned by the UK Ministry of Defence.
Clermont House was built in 1971/2 in the walled garden of Clermont Hall as a replacement for Clermont Hall and as an agent's house. John Davies, Prince-Smith's resident land agent from 1971—1997, bought Clermont House in 1977. Davies added to the house in later years and in 1983 developed an arboretum extending which is open to public visitors. In 1972 Clermont Hall was found to be riddled with dry rot but attempts to demolish were thwarted by the imposition of a preservation order. The hall was sold in 1973 to Philip Jones, an artist, who demolished the servants quarters and restored the main house in of land with cottages.

Steve Martin (Virginia politician)

Stephen Holliday "Steve" Martin (born June 15, 1956, in Chesterfield County, Virginia) is an American politician of the Republican Party. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates 1988–1994. Since 1994 he has been a member of the Senate of Virginia. He currently represents the 11th district, including parts of Chesterfield County and the city of Colonial Heights, in the southern suburbs of Richmond.
In 1987, Martin defeated incumbent Democrat Leslie Saunders for the 67th District House of Delegates seat, 51%-49%. In 1989, Saunders challenged Martin for the seat, but Martin won 55%-45%. Due to redistricting, Martin was redrawn into the 27th District in 1991, and won the House of Delegates seat unopposed, and was re-elected in 1993. In February 1994, Martin won a special election to the state Senate in the 11th District after Robert Russell resigned after being convicted of embezzlement. He received 75% of the vote in a four-way race. Martin was easily re-elected to the seat in 1995 (he was unopposed), 1999 (won 65%-35%), 2003 (unopposed), 2007 (received 63% of the vote in a four-way race), and 2011 (unopposed).
Senator Martin serves as one of two Virginia state chairmen for the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).
Senator Martin announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia in 2013 in June 2012.
Martin made news in 2014 when he wrote a lengthy post on Facebook claiming that pregnant women are "hosts" who have no right to end their pregnancies via abortion. He later edited the post to replace "host" with "bearer of the child."
<br>
Personal Life.
As of February 2014, his Virginia Senate website states, 'Steve was born in Chesterfield County, Virginia and has seven siblings.' Several political watchdog groups list Martin's only "Education" as a Virginia high school diploma from the Lynchburg Christian Academy, in Lynchburg, VA. He lists his religious affiliation as "Baptist" and his official website states, 'Steve is a member of South Richmond Rotary and Swift Creek Baptist Church. He enjoys spending time with his sons and his two granddaughters, Olivia and Mckinley, and looks forward to welcoming his third grandchild in the near future.' According to "Project Vote Smart", as of 2012 Martin was still married to wife Sharon, and they had two adult sons, Chad, and Nathan. The updated wording of the senator's personal webpage, the use of the singular personal pronoun ""his" third grandchild", vice "their third grandchild" indicates he is recently divorced. In the official website for the "Virginia Senate Republican Caucus" nearly every member lists his spouse and college alma mater: as of early 2014, the page for Martin omits any mention of a spouse or college education. Most Virginia state legislators hold "outside" jobs and Martin works in financial services, as a licensed insurance consultant and securities dealer, heading his own firm-- Martin Financial Services.

Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Depot (Yankton, South Dakota)

The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Depot in Yankton, South Dakota was built in 1905 by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (otherwise known as The Milwaukee Road).
Prior to the 1870s, Yankton was served by steamboats along the Missouri River. As service declined, railroads took over to serve the communities in South Dakota. In the late 1870s, the Dakota Southern Railroad entered Yankton. Shortly afterward, the Dakota Southern was bought by The Milwaukee Road. The Milwaukee Road then expanded westward toward Rapid City, South Dakota and the Black Hills. 
In 1905, The Milwaukee Road built its depot in Yankton. Using a common design, the depot is rectangular in shape and single story. It is built of brick with wood and stone trim. There is a covered area at one end of the depot that leads to the waiting room. A baggage room is located at the other end and the station agent's office is located between the two. 
As railroad passenger service declined after the 1940s, the depot was sold. The Milwaukee Road itself went bankrupt in the 1980s, and the tracks adjacent to the depot were sold to the BNSF Railway. At the time of nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, the depot was used as offices for a local cable television company. In 2008, the depot houses the offices of an architectural firm.
The depot was listed in the National Register because of its architecture and also because of it association with the commercial development of Yankton and the development of railroads in South Dakota.

3rd Tipperary Brigade

The 3rd Tipperary Brigade was one of approximately 80 such units that constituted the Irish Republican Army since the time of their formation from the Irish Volunteers, until after the Civil War. The Brigade was based in southern Tipperary and conducted its activities mainly in mid-Munster.
Establishment.
The core of the unit from its earliest existence was the group known as 'The Big Four'. These were Seán Treacy, Dan Breen, Séamus Robinson and Seán Hogan.
War of Independence.
The 3rd Tipperary Brigade was one of the most active during the War of Independence. The ambush led by Treacy, Robinson and Breen at Soloheadbeg is generally acknowledged as the opening engagement of that war. Two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, James McDonnell and Patrick O'Connell were killed in the attack. Breen has left apparently conflicting accounts of their intentions that day. One implies that the purpose of the confrontation was merely to capture explosives and detonators being escorted to a nearby quarry. The other, that the group intended killing the police escort to provoke a military response.
"Treacy had stated to me that the only way of starting a war was to kill someone, and we wanted to start a war, so we intended to kill some of the police whom we looked upon as the foremost and most important branch of the enemy forces ... The only regret that we had following the ambush was that there were only two policemen in it, instead of the six we had expected."
Civil War.
Reservations about the Treaty caused division within the Brigade. Some members sided with the Provisional Government, (later the Irish Free State), while others remained neutral during the ensuing Civil War. The majority, including flying column commander Dinny Lacey and Seumas Robinson, took the Republican side. Lacey was killed in action against Free State troops in 1923 in the Glen of Aherlow while Robinson was a General throughout the civil war.

Dublin, Maryland

Dublin is an unincorporated community in Harford County, Maryland, United States. Dublin was founded in the early 19th century by George McCausland and a friend who migrated from Dublin, Ireland.
History.
The first record of the village of Dublin is found in the Act of Assembly Districts of 18th century, which divided the county into election districts and designated Dublin the vote place for the Fifth district. Martenet's map of 1878 shows McCausland built a home on one side of what is now Route 440 and a tavern or inn on the other side. The tavern on the southeast side was a long two story building that was very close to the road. The building had a porch on the first and second stories.
In old records reference is made of the Mt. Ararat Lodge of Masons, Maryland, which moved its meeting place in 1809 from a tavern in Delta, Pennsylvania to George McCausland's tavern in Dublin. The lodge remained there until 1826, then moved to the old Masonic Lodge on Bond Street in Bel Air.
On the northeast corner of Routes 440 and 136 was a small log house, with a short circular stairway and a fireplace which was used as a school and referred to as "the academy". Along with several of the older homes, it burned in 1971.
In 1858, the town had ten houses and places of business. Among the owners were McComas, Gallion, James, Rausey, J. Dougherty and Jones. Dublin had a post office in 1878, one of the first in Harford County. The town now boasted two stores, a blacksmith shop, a wheelwright shop, a church, a school and two taverns. Dublin school was a part of the public school system in 1867 with a one-room building on present-day Route 136 across from the present school.
In 1800 Charles Beavers donated land for a Methodist house of worship (on present-day Route 136). A log structure was first erected, and later a clapboard one-room was built which served the congregation until 1939. The Methodist bishop sent a deacon to start a church in Dublin. The deacon was visiting Bush Chapel, on the Bush River, and traveled through Dublin to the Greenstone area, now on Baltimore Boy Scout land off Peach Orchard Road. That area was well populated with strong Methodist and also by being on the river and several mining ore mills. The area was very thickly settled. Several stones can be seen which are believed to be part of the foundation the deacon started. He never returned and in later years a church was started in Dublin.
Dublin has long been known for the incident of "The Headless Peddler". This occurred in 1763 on John Bryarly's farm on a stream called Rock Run. After this event, the stream name was changed to Peddler's Run. The end of the story wasn't closed until 1843 on James Warner's farm. The road, now Route 440 through Dublin, was known as Dublin-Stafford Road. This was the main road to Bel Air and the Susquehanna River where the commercial life was. The travel pattern of the county was from Bush River up to Churchville, into Dublin and to the Susquehanna River; there was no Route 1 until later years.
Dublin has two very old cemeteries, a north and a south. The South Cemetery is on Deerfield Road. At one time a small church was erected there for the slaves and Southern sympathizers. You can still make out the foundation lines of the church. The oldest tombstone is dated 1820, though possibly there are older unmarked slaves' graves.
The other cemetery is with the Dublin United Methodist Church on Route 136. On the Martenet's map of 1858, the village was not spread out but in a small area. The Indians had mostly vacated this area by the 18th century but they had left the land very poor and barren for crops. The area was known as Arabin Petra, a tract of about (or hundredth as was used in those days). This land was originally acquired by Dr. Charles Carroll.
Usually when a settlement was made of a town, the first three things established were a church, a school and a jail. There is no record of a jail for Dublin. But the local story goes that if you didn't live in Dublin, you better have your business in town settled by dark or else the locals would "send you packin'".
Land area.
Dublin was part of a tract of land patented to Dr. Charles Carroll of Annapolis, Maryland. He was issued a patented certificate on June 15, 1721. The tract lying north of Deer Creek was known as "Arabia Petrea".
Dr. Carroll sold "Arabia Petrea" to Jacob Giles and Isaac Webster in 1733. Isaac and Jacob were brothers-in-law. Isaac and Jacob in turn sold off part to new settlers moving into the area. Two of the newcomers in Dublin were William Beaver and Walter Ashmore. Isaac and Giles sold lands east of Route 136 to Walter Ashmore and land west of Route 136 to William Beaver. William Beaver willed his land to his son Charles Beaver.
In 1796 Charles petitioned the court to have appointed commissioners "mark and bound" his land. The first stone was set November 8, 1796 with a "B" carved in the face. After 204 years, the stone still stands in that spot which is located in the northwest corner of The Evangelical Methodist Church of Dublin.
Charles Beaver, now aging, started to sell off parts of his farm. In 1794 he leased/purchased a lot on the northeast corner of Route 136 and Route 440 (1603 Whiteford Road) to George McCausland. In 1798 he sold to John Evatt on the southwest side of Route 136 and Route 440 (1536 Whiteford Road).
On October 20, 1800, Charles sold about to five trustees for a church to be erected (1528 Whiteford Road). In 1802 he sold lot #1 to George McCausland on which George erected a tavern. This also served as the Fifth district voting place (Walt Moody's lot). In 1802 Charles sold to John Evatt (Roger Waddell's lot and Ira Lee's field).
The first school set up in Dublin was in 1812 on a lot from William Nevill to trustees William Silver, John Galbreath, George McCausland, and Thomas Barnes. This lot bordered Beaver's land and "was to have rights to the cool spring." The first public school in Dublin, by act of the 1850 General Assembly of Maryland, was started in 1855. The quarter acre lot was purchased from Jonathan Lemmon and was next to the church lot. This served as Dublin's public school until 1915 when a new school was built across the road.
Dublin in 1858 was said to have had ten houses and places of business. By 1878 Dublin boasted two stores, a blacksmith shop, a wheelwright shop, a hoop maker, a tailor shop, one school and two churches, Dublin Methodist Episcopal Church and for the southerners Southern Methodist Episcopal Church. Some of the residents in 1878 were:
T.J. McCausland, R. Hooper, James Chenowith, R. Gallion, A.L. McCann, J.E. Jones, E. Willis, John McDoon, John Daughtery, William Neville, Jonathan Lemmon, Jane Davis, A.B. Lindsey, James Ramsey, John Crawford and John Deckman.
Dublin Methodist Church.
History of Dublin Methodist Church.
In 1772 Bishop Frances Asbury had been in the area preaching and ministering the various areas. He returned to England and sent a deacon to establish a church in the area. A foundation was laid at the populated Greenstone, now on the Baltimore Boy Scout Camp off of Robinson Mill Road. The large stones can still be seen. For some reason the church was never completed.
In 1800 Charles Beaver in Dublin conveyed 126 square perches of land (0.9 acres) to five Trustees in trust, "that they erect or build or have erected or built a house of worship for the use of the member's of the Methodist Episcopal Church." Probably in 1860 a clapboard construction, one room building was erected and served the community for eighty years.
In 1939 while demolishing the old clapboard church to make way for the new Port Deposit granite stone church, a date of 1860 was found carved in one of the roof rafters of the old church. The new church which is constructed of local material, stone from Port Deposit and slate from Slateville also has ten beautiful stained glass windows donated by members of the church. Thanks to many donated hours of labor the total cost of the church was only $14,053.
In 1963 a two story education wing was added to the existing building, and over the past several years several remodeling projects have been completed in various areas of the church.
In 1870 David and Driscilla Riley sold to the church and 120 square perches of land and dwelling for $13,000 to be used as the parsonage for the Harford circuit. The building was a two-story log construction, which was located just west of the present Dublin Market on Route 440 (Kilgore-Botts property) until 1977 when it burnt down. In 1872 Reverend Clarkson who was assigned to the eight church circuit (including Dublin, Darlington, Franklin, Watters Meeting Run, Mt. Zion, Bel Air, Mt. Vernon, and Emory) refers to the condition and appearance of the parsonage in his journal.
In 1888 the first parsonage and 120 square perches of land was sold to Catherine Daugherty and a second parsonage was built on the remaining part of the lot. This served as the parsonage until 1968 when a new brick structure was built on Route 136 next to the church. The second parsonage was then sold.
Many can remember an old building that sat where the present day parsonage on Route 136 is; it was the original Dublin School. The three room structure was used for grades 1 thru 11 until 1915 when a new wooden schoolhouse was constructed across the road. R.L. McCann willed the old schoolhouse and land to the church. It was utilized as a Boy Scout meeting house until it was demolished to make way for the present day parsonage.
The church today.
Today the congregation has many 4-generation worshippers attending services. In the spring of 2000 the Dublin United Methodist Church, being one of the oldest Methodist churches in the New World, celebrated 200 years of worshipping.
Schools.
Dublin Elementary School.
The mascot of Dublin Elementary School is the dragon. The motto is "Make Dublin Proud!". Located in the rural countryside of Harford County, Dublin Elementary serves approximately 250 students from pre-kindergarten through fifth grade.

<doc id="20042250" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20042250" title="Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty">
Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty

The Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty () was a bilateral treaty signed between the Soviet Union and Lithuania on October 10, 1939. According to provisions outlined in the treaty, Lithuania would acquire about one fifth of the Vilnius Region, including Lithuania's historical capital, Vilnius, and in exchange would allow five Soviet military bases with 20,000 troops to be established across Lithuania. In essence the treaty with Lithuania was very similar to the treaties that the Soviet Union signed with Estonia on September 28, and with Latvia on October 5. According to official Soviet sources, the Soviet military was strengthening the defenses of a weak nation against possible attacks by Nazi Germany. The treaty provided that Lithuania's sovereignty would not be affected. However, in reality the treaty opened the door for the first Soviet occupation of Lithuania and was described by "The New York Times" as "virtual sacrifice of independence."
Background.
Pre-war treaties.
Lithuania declared independence from the Russian Empire on February 16, 1918. On June 12, 1920, following the brief Lithuanian–Soviet War, a Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was signed. The Soviet Union recognized Lithuania's independence and its right to the Vilnius Region. The region was fiercely contested with Poland and fell under its control after Żeligowski's Mutiny in October 1920. It was then incorporated into the Republic of Central Lithuania, and later annexed by Poland in 1922. The Lithuanians refused to recognize Polish control and continued to claim legal and moral rights to the region. The Soviet Union continued to support Lithuanian claims against Poland. The two parties confirmed the Peace Treaty of 1920 by signing the Soviet–Lithuanian Non-Aggression Pact in 1926, and later extended it to 1944.
On August 23, 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. According to pact's secret protocols, Lithuania was assigned to the German sphere of influence while Latvia and Estonia, the other two Baltic states, were assigned to the Soviets. This different treatment could be explained by Lithuania's economic dependence on Germany. Germany accounted for approximately 80% of Lithuania's foreign trade and after the 1939 German ultimatum had control of Klaipėda, Lithuania's only port. Also, Lithuania and Russia did not have a common border.
World War II.
On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Wehrmacht pushed Polish forces behind the line agreed with the Soviets. Germans took control of the Lublin Voivodeship and eastern Warsaw Voivodeship. When on September 17 Red Army invaded Poland, Russian troops took over Vilnius Region, which according to the 1920 and 1926 Soviet–Lithuanian treaties was recognized to Lithuania. As a result, Soviets and Germans re-negotiated the secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. On September 28, 1939, they signed the Boundary and Friendship Treaty. Its secret attachment detailed that to compensate the Soviet Union for German-occupied Polish territories, Germany would transfer Lithuania, except for a small territory in Suvalkija, to the Soviet sphere of influence. The exchange of territories was also motivated by Russia's control of Vilnius: the Soviet Union could exert significant influence on the Lithuanian government, which claimed Vilnius to be its "de jure" capital. In the secret protocols, both Russia and Germany explicitly recognized Lithuanian interest in Vilnius.

On September 29, the next day after the Boundary and Friendship Treaty, Germany canceled planned talks with Lithuania and the Soviet Union informed Lithuania that it wished to open negotiations regarding future relationship between the two countries. The new Soviet–Lithuanian negotiations were supposed to formally resolve the status of the Vilnius Region. Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urbšys arrived to Moscow on October 3. During the meeting Joseph Stalin personally informed Urbšys about the Soviet–German secret protocols and showed maps of the spheres of influence. He demanded that Lithuania signed three separate treaties, according to which:
Urbšys' protested the Soviet bases arguing that it would mean virtual occupation of Lithuania. Soviets argued that their army would protect Lithuania from possible attacks from Nazi Germany and that a similar treaty was already signed with Estonia. Urbšys argued that Lithuania's neutrality was enough to guarantee its security and proposed to strengthen Lithuanian army. Soviets agreed to reduce the number of troops to 35,000. Urbšys also bargained for more territories in the Vilnius Region, especially in the vicinity of Druskininkai and Švenčionys, territories with larger Lithuanian population. The Soviets replied that the boundary draw by the 1920 peace treaty was inaccurate and that Belarusians also laid claims to the territory. Russians tentatively agreed that territories, where Lithuanian majority could be proven, would be transferred to Lithuania. The most shocking demand was to cede part of Lithuanian territory to Germany. Lithuanians decided to postpone any negotiations regarding territory transfer to Germany until Germans expressed clear demands.
Acceptance.
Urbšys returned to Lithuania to consult the government. German officials confirmed that the secret protocols were real and informed Lithuanians that transfer of the territory in Suvalkija was not an urgent matter. Eventually, Nazi Germany sold rights this territory to the Soviet Union for 7.5 million dollars on January 10, 1941 in the German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement. Lithuanians in principle agreed to sign the mutual assistance treaty, but were instructed to resist Soviet bases as much as possible. Alternatives included doubling Lithuanian army, exchanging military missions, and building fortifications on the western border with Germany similar to the Maginot Line in France. On October 7, Lithuanian delegation, including General Stasys Raštikis and Deputy Prime Minister Kazys Bizauskas, returned to Moscow. Stalin refused the proposed alternatives, but agreed to reduce the number of Russian troops to 20,000 – about the size of the entire Lithuanian army. Russians wanted to sign the treaty right then to commemorate the 19th anniversary of the Żeligowski's Mutiny and Lithuania's loss of Vilnius. Political rallies, organized in Vilnius demanding city's incorporation into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, put additional pressure on Lithuanians and provided a sense of urgency. Urbšys refused to sign and the talks receded for the second time. 
In Lithuania, President Antanas Smetona doubted that it was worth gaining Vilnius for such a price and debated whether the negotiations could be broken off. Bizauskas argued that refusing the treaty would not prevent Soviet Union from implementing its plan. Russia had already threatened Estonia with force in case it refused its mutual assistance treaty and was gathering forces in Vilnius Region in the east and in Latvia in the north. In such light, the government decided to demand as much territory as possible. However, when the delegation returned to Moscow, it found the atmosphere changed. Russians were inflexible, refused further negotiations, and intimidated the delegation to sign the treaty. They presented a new draft, which combined the mutual assistance pact and transfer of Vilnius into one agreement. The Lithuanian delegation saw little choice but to sign the proposed treaty. After signing the treaty, Stalin invited the Lithuanian delegation to celebrate and to watch two movies with him. Urbšys informed the Lithuanian government about signing of the treaty only in the morning of October 11 – at the time the treaty was already published by Russian news agency TASS.
Provisions.
Articles of the treaty.
The mutual assistance treaty contained nine articles:
The treaty also had a secret supplement, which specified that the Soviets could station only up to 20,000 of their troops.
Location of Soviet troops.
The treaty did not decide the exact location of the Soviet bases and 18-member Russian delegation, led by Mikhail Kovalyov, was sent to Lithuania to discuss the specifics on October 22. The Lithuanians sought to limit Soviet bases to Vilnius Region and southern Lithuania, offering Pabradė, Nemenčinė, Naujoji Vilnia, and Alytus. They considered a base in Samogitia (western Lithuania) to be the worst possible outcome. The Lithuanians preferred fewer, but bigger bases with no permanent runways for the aircraft. The Russians initially proposed to have their bases in Vilnius, Kaunas, Alytus, Ukmergė, and Šiauliai. The final agreement was signed on October 28, the same day when the Lithuanian army marched into Vilnius. A day before, another agreement determined the new border of eastern Lithuania: Lithuania received of territory with population of approximately 430,000. The territory comprised about one fifth of the Vilnius Region recognized to Lithuania by the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty of 1920; population of Lithuania reached about 3.8 million.
According to the final agreement, four military bases would be established in Lithuania with 18,786 military personnel from the 16th Special Rifle Corps, 5th Rifle Division, and 2nd Light Tank Brigade. The bases were to be located in Alytus (infantry, artillery, and mechanized units with 8,000 troops), Prienai (infantry and artillery units with 2,500 soldiers), Gaižiūnai (mechanized and tank units with 3,500 troops), and in Naujoji Vilnia (headquarters, infantry and artillery units with 4,500 troops). For comparison, on June 1, 1940 Lithuanian army had 22,265 soldiers and 1,728 officers. While aircraft bases in Alytus and Gaižiūnai were under construction, Russian aircraft were to be stationed in Kirtimai, a neighborhood of Vilnius. The final location of the bases showed that the Soviets were more concerned with encircling Kaunas, the temporary capital, than with defending the country against a possible foreign attack.
Aftermath.
International and domestic reaction.
The treaty was presented as proof of Soviet respect to small nations and Stalin's benevolence by Soviet propaganda. Russians emphasized that it was the second time the Soviet Union gave Vilnius to Lithuania while the League of Nations failed to mediate Polish–Lithuanian dispute. Soviets also worked to assure Lithuanians that Soviet friendship is effective protection from and a welcome alternative to Nazi aggression. Polish government-in-exile officially protested the treaty as it did not recognize Russian conquest and claimed sovereignty over territories of the Second Polish Republic. Lithuanians replied that the region was legally part of Lithuania. Poles resented the transfer and as soon as the Soviet Army left Vilnius, anti-Lithuanian riots broke out accusing Lithuanians of betrayal. France and Great Britain, traditional allies of Poland, also condemned the treaty. Belarusian activists, who campaigned for Vilnius incorporation into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, were arrested, deported, or executed by the Soviet authorities. The transfer upset their national aspirations to position Belarus as a successor to the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Lithuanian relations with Vatican were expected to improve as the cause for tension, Vilnius Region assigned to Poland by the Concordat of 1925, now was under Lithuanian control.
Lithuanian politicians attempted to show the regained Vilnius as a major diplomatic victory. The Lithuanian Nationalists Union, ruling political party in Lithuania since the 1926 coup, used celebrations of return of the city to increase its prestige and popularity. The government stressed its competence and the opposition emphasized Soviet generosity. While politicians publicly praised the Soviet Union and taunted "traditional Soviet–Lithuanian friendship," in private they understood this treaty was a serious threat to Lithuanian independence. Popular attitude was reflected in a known slogan "Vilnius – mūsų, Lietuva – rusų" (Vilnius is ours, but Lithuania is Russia's). After the treaty was signed, Lithuania lost its neutrality and could not independently execute its foreign policy. For example, Lithuania could not support Finland when the Winter War broke out after Finland rejected a similar mutual assistance treaty proposed by Russia. In international politics, Lithuania became a Russian satellite.
In Vilnius Region.
On October 28, the Lithuanian Army entered Vilnius for the first time since 1920. Before handing over the city to the Lithuanians, the Soviets robbed and transported to Russia all valuables: equipment from factories (including Elektrit) and hospitals, vehicles and trains, cultural objects from museums and libraries. After the Russian troops left, Polish residents, seeing the deal as a betrayal of Poland, protested against the Lithuanian government. On October 30 – November 1, when bread price suddenly rose, clashes between local communists and Poles turned into a riot against the Jewish population. Many Jewish shops were raided and some 35 people were injured. Jews accused Lithuanian police of inaction and sympathizing with Polish rioters. Soviet soldiers, uninvited by the Lithuanian government, helped to subdue the riots.
The territory presented an economic challenge to Lithuania: unemployment was rampant, food was in short supply, valuables were stolen by Russian army, war refugees were gathering from other former Polish territories. The Lithuanian army would provide up to 25,000 daily rations of hot soup and bread to residents of Vilnius. Lithuanian government exchanged the Polish złoty to Lithuanian litas at a favorable rate, losing over 20 million litas. The Lithuanian government decided to implement a land reform similar to the land reform, executed in 1920s. Large estates would be nationalized and distributed to landless peasants in exchange for redemption dues payable in 36 years. Politicians hoped that such reform would weaken pro-Polish landowners and would win peasants' loyalty to the Lithuanian state. By March 1940, 90 estates and 23,000 hectares were distributed. Lithuanians proceeded to "re-Lithuanize" cultural life in Vilnius Region. They closed many Polish cultural and educational institutions, including Stephan Batory University with over 3,000 students. Lithuanians sought to introduce the Lithuanian language in public life and sponsored Lithuanian organizations and cultural activities.
In Lithuania.
Future of the Vilnius Region caused frictions between political and military leaders in Lithuania. As first Russian troops moved into Lithuania on November 14, the government, which included four generals, resigned. A new civilian cabinet, led by controversial Prime Minister Antanas Merkys, was formed on November 21. Lithuanians were careful to follow the treaty to a letter and not to give any excuses for Moscow to accuse them of treaty violations. At first, delayed by the Winter War, the Soviets did not interfere with Lithuania's domestic affairs and Russian soldiers were well-behaved in their bases. The Lithuanian government started debating its options and what could be done to prepare for the future occupation. Despite various resolutions, nothing material was accomplished. Lithuania had no counterweight to Soviet influence: its own forces were small, Germany was in effect Russia's ally, Poland was conquered, France and Great Britain had bigger issues in western Europe. After the Winter War was over, Soviet Union turned its attention to the Baltic States.
After months of intense propaganda and diplomatic pressure, the Soviets issued an ultimatum on June 14, 1940 – the same day when world's attention was focused on fall of Paris during the Battle of France. Soviets accused Lithuania of violating the treaty and abducting Russian soldiers from their bases. Soviets demanded that a new government, which would comply with the Mutual Assistance Treaty, would be formed and that an unspecified number of Soviet troops would be admitted to Lithuania. With Soviet troops already in the country, it was impossible to mount military resistance. Soviets took control of government institutions, installed a new pro-Soviet government, and announced elections to the People's Seimas. Proclaimed Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was incorporated into the Soviet Union on August 3, 1940.

Weingut St. Antony

St. Antony is a wine estate in the Rheinhessen wine-growing region in Germany, that has been making wine since the end of the First World War.
The small-scale winery is located in Nierstein on the Rhine and owns around 26 hectares of vineyards. It is member of the Verband Deutscher Prädikats- und Qualitätsweingüter (short VDP). Chief oenologist is the Geisenheimer Felix Peters.
History.
In 1912 the Gutehoffnungshütte (later MAN AG) purchased a lime pit in the south of Nierstein including the neighbouring vineyards. The limestone is needed as raw material for the production in the ironworks of Oberhausen (Ruhr Area). After the First World War the demand for limestone decreased drastically and the management decided to use the purchased area for viticulture. In 1920 the first vintage is vinified. The wines of the estate „Gutehoffnungshütte“ were consumed only within the company or donated, later sold, to key customers. The lime pit was sold in 1955, with the proceeds reinvested in the winery. As part of this transaction top Nierstein vineyard sites were purchased and became assets of the estate and the oenologic equipment was modernized.
In the 1980s the corporate structure was changed and the Gutehoffnungshütte run under the MAN label. Also the "Weingut" received a new name in 1995 and is called Weingut St. Antony, after the first ironworks, St.-Antony-Hütte, in Oberhausen.
The responsibility for the winery had been directly located at the corporate management, chief oenologist was Alexander Michalsky. During this time St. Antony gathered a place in the top 100 wineries in Germany.
In 2005 Detlev Meyer, a private investor who is a textile merchant, acquired the estate. Since July 2008 another top Nierstein winery „Heyl zu Herrnsheim“, with another 13 hectares, was long time rented by Meyer and merged with St. Antony. The winemaking of both is located now in the former Gustav Adolf Schmitt winery.
Geography.
The estate stretches across the so-called „Roter Hang“ (red slope) with steep slope viticulture and presence of red slate in Nierstein and comprises part of the top vineyard sites „Orbel“, „Pettenthal“, „Hipping“ and „Ölberg“. The „Brudersberg“ site is in exclusive possession of „Heyl zu Herrnsheim“. St. Antonys vineyards in the Rheinhessen wine region are within the boundaries of the collective sites ("Großlagen") of Spiegelberg, Rehbach and Auflangen, which are not displayed on the label. The basic wines are simply labelled with grape variety and estate name. Only the Erstes Gewächs designation which claim to be highly ""terroir"-expressive", display the Lage on the label.
Visitors.
The estate is not open to the public.

Harold Cole

Harold (Harry) Cole (24 January 1906 – 8 January 1946), also known as Paul Cole, was a British soldier, who assisted and later betrayed the French Resistance during World War II. According to some accounts, he caused significant damage to the Allied cause. Cole was killed while resisting arrest after the war ended. 
On 4 September 1939, Cole, who had recently been released from prison, enlisted in the British Army (Serial No. 1877989RE), and was assigned to an engineering unit, the 18th Field Park Company, part of the 4th Infantry Division. His unit was sent to France in late 1939 as a part of the British Expeditionary Force and was stationed in Loison-sous-Lens. Cole was promoted to Sergeant, but was taken prisoner by German forces during the Fall of France in mid-1940. 
Cole escaped soon afterwards, hiding in Lille and then Marseilles, where he helped establish and operate escape lines with the French Resistance. During this period he was known as "Paul Cole".
In 1941, he was re-captured by German forces; the Gestapo persuaded Cole to collaborate and betray the escape lines he had helped to form in occupied France. He denounced many important figures in the resistance movement including Ian Garrow and Albert Guerisse (1911–1989) of the Pat Line. It is believed Cole betrayed at least 150 members of the French Resistance, of whom 50 were executed by the Gestapo. The Deputy Commander of Scotland Yard at the time, Reginald Spooner described him as "the worst traitor of the war".
By the end of the war, Cole was wanted by both French and British governments, and was pursued by MI9. He was captured at Bad Saulgau in June 1945 and imprisoned at the SHAEF military prison in Paris, from which he escaped on 18 November 1945. A large manhunt was initiated for his re-capture.
On 8 January 1946, after receiving a tip, French police shot Harold Cole dead after discovering that he had been hiding on the fourth floor of a bar in the "Rue de Grenelle" in Paris. He was later buried in an unmarked pauper's grave in Paris.

Biography.
After graduating from Morehouse College in Atlanta, Stewart used the money he had made from throwing parties at college to build a small studio with a couple of friends. The group then signed several young producers in the Atlanta area.
Stewart's skills as a talent magnet were recognized by Antonio "L.A." Reid, who at the time was just starting the company Hitco Music Publishing, and saw him as someone with "a finger on the pulse of the next generation of hot producers in the Atlanta music scene". At the time Reid was trying to connect to a wholly different market of producers and songwriters and so offered Stewart his first position as an intern-level creative person. 
It was while at Hitco Music Publishing that Stewart signed Beyoncé. In 2000, he was appointed A&R consultant at LaFace Records signing Ciara to the label. He stayed there until 2004.

The Ghost of a Flea

The Ghost of a Flea is a miniature painting by the English poet, painter and printmaker William Blake, held in the Tate Gallery, London. Measuring only 8.42 inches × 6.3 inches (21.4 × 16.2 cm), it is executed in a tempera mixture with gold, on a mahogany-type tropical hardwood panel. Completed between 1819 and 1820, it is part of a series of works depicting "Visionary Heads" commissioned by the watercolourist and astrologist John Varley (1788–1842). Fantastic, spiritual art was popular in Britain from around 1770 to 1830, and during this time Blake often worked on unearthly, supernatural panels to amuse and amaze his friends.
At 21.4 cm × 16.2 cm the work is a greatly reduced miniature portrait. Blake generally worked on a small scale; most of his illuminated pages, engravings and many of his paintings are only inches high. Although "Ghost of a Flea" is one of Blake's smallest works, it is monumental in its imagination. Its tiny scale achieves drama in contrasting the muscular bulk and apparent power of the creature against its incarnation in the panel as an insect.
Background.
Blake first met John Varley in the autumn of 1818. Varley was 30 years younger than the artist, 
and has been described as a "genial 17-stone bear of a man." A student of astrology and zodiacal physiognomy, Varley held a strong belief in the existence of spirits, but was frustrated by his inability to see them. Thus he was drawn to Blake, who claimed to have seen visions daily since when as a small child he had seen a tree "filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars." The two would often gather late at night in Varley's house, and played a game in which Varley would attempt to summon the spirit of a historical or mythological person. On the appearance of the spirit, Blake would then attempt to sketch their likeness.
According to Varley, the imagery of a Flea came to Blake during an 1819 séance. Varley described the scene:
Blake's Victorian biographer Alexander Gilchrist (1828–1861) wrote that, three decades earlier in 1790, "Blake, for the only time in his life, "saw a ghost"... Standing one evening at his garden-door in Lambeth, and chancing to look up, he saw a horrible grim figure, 'scaly, speckled, very awful,' stalking downstairs towards him. More frightened than ever before or after, he took to his heels, and ran out of the house."

Pencil on paper, 189 mm × 153 mm, c. 1819. Tate, London]]
Although not directly stated by Gilchrist, there is a close connection between the ghost and the later "The Head of the Ghost of a Flea".
Blake often said that he was joined by invisible sitters as he drew them, including, he claimed, a number of angels, Voltaire, Moses and the Flea, who told him that "fleas were inhabited by the souls of such men as were by nature blood thirsty to excess." In his obituary, it was stated that, "The flea communicated to Mr. Blake what passed, as related to himself, at the "Creation". 'It was first intended,' said he (the flea) 'to make me as big as a bullock; but then when it was considered from my construction, so armed—and so powerful withal, that in proportion to my bulk, (mischievous as I now am) that I should have been a too mighty destroyer; it was determined to make me—no bigger than I am."
In both his artwork and poetry, Blake often gave personality and human form to such abstractions as time, death, plague and famine. Fleas are often associated with uncleanliness and degradation; in this work, the artist sought to magnify a flea into "a monsterous creature whose bloodthirsty instinct was imprinted on every detail of its appearance, with 'burning eyes which long for moisture', and a 'face worthy of a murderer'."
Description.
The muscular and nude Flea is depicted using its jutting tongue to gorge on a bowl of blood. Part human, part vampire and part reptile, the beast strides from right to left between heavy and richly patterned curtains. In his left hand he holds an acorn and in his right a thorn, both items drawn from the tradition of fairy iconography. His massive neck is similar to that of a bull, and holds a disproportionally small head, marked by glaring eyes and open jaws, and a venomous slithering tongue. According to the art critic Jonathan Jones, the flea is depicted as an "evil, gothic, grotesque stalking through a starry realm between stage curtains."
"Ghost of a Flea" is distinguished by its innovative use of gold leaf. Beneath the curtain folds, the flesh of the flea and bright stars, Blake placed a thin foil of "white" gold which he made from gold-silver alloy. He then used a brush and powdered gold foil made into paint to colour much of the minute detail. Blake overlaid using thick brown paint derived from sugar, gum and glue.
The painting was created using Blake's distinctive tempera technique, which he describes in the lower right of the panel, beneath the shell gold signature, as "fresco". On the reverse of the panel is written, "The Vision of the Spirit that inhabits the body of a Flea, and which appeared to the late Mr. Blake, the Designer of the vignettes for Blair Grave and the Book of Job. The Visions first appeared to him in my presence, and after wards till he had finished this picture. The Flea drew blood on this." Today the work is in relatively poor condition, partly due to the technique employed by Blake. Areas of the surface have cracked and dulled with age.
Although Blake was singular in his ability to directly transcribe visions onto canvas or paper, a number of visual and literary sources can be detected in this work. The art historian Hope Werness suggested that "The Flea" may be inspired by a 1665 work by early microscopist Robert Hooke (1635–1703), whose "Micographia, or some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies being Made by Magnifying Glasses, with Observations and Inquiries Thereupon" includes a drawing of a flea microscopically observed.
Comparisons have been made to Henry Fuseli's monstrous imps, while the image of the flea echos figures in Blake's earlier work, and his scaly body is similar to the monster in his 1805 pen and ink drawing "Pestilence: Death of the First Born". In 2006, the Tate hung "The Ghost of a Flea" and William Raddon's 1827 engraving after Fuseli's The Nightmare side by side in the "The Nightmare in Modern Culture" room of their "Fuseli, Blake and the Romantic Imagination" exhibition.
Reception.
During his lifetime, Blake's prints were described as the work of a madman. This view was reinforced when word spread that Blake was inspired through visions, and, according to G. E. Bentley, "So plain was Blake's madness to some that they assumed he must have been confined in a madhouse" and few were willing to believe that the artist actually saw anything.
In 2006, the painting was described by the "New York Times" as Blake's "quite strangest and certainly most Gothic work".
Provenance.
"The Ghost of a Flea" was purchased by Varley around 1820, and later passed to his son Albert Varley. A label on the reverse of the canvas states that the panel was sold by Albert in February 1878, a fact confirmed by an inscription written by the poet and artist William Bell Scott (1811–1890) on the inside back cover of the Blake-Varley Sketchbook which reads, "I have since getting this book 1870, bought the painting of the "Ghost" of the Flea, from Mr Varley of Oakley St. Chelsea, son of John Varley". On July 14, 1892 it was sold at Sotheby's to W. Graham Robertson for £10.50.
It was first exhibited at Carfax, Oxford, in 1906. In preparation for this showing, the panel was partially cleaned of dust. It was further treated when the exhibition ended by Stanley Littlejohn (1877–1917), who, in the words of the Blake collector W. Graham Robertson, lifted "the veil of darkness...from it without any impairing of the surface, and the picture now appears exactly as described by Allan Cunningham. The colours, though deep, are clear and brilliant; the gold, used to heighten the lights, shines with its old power, and on the floor, between the feet of the striding." It was first displayed at the Tate on loan in 1913, and donated to the gallery by Robertson in 1948.

The Portlligat Museum-House is the house (formerly a number of small fisherman's huts) where Salvador Dalí usually lived and worked from 1930 to 1982, when, upon the death of his wife Gala Dalí, he took up residence at Púbol Castle.
The house has a labyrinthine structure which, from one point of departure, the Bear Lobby, spreads out and winds around in a succession of zones linked by narrow corridors, slight changes of level and blind passageways. 
All the rooms have windows of different shapes and proportions framing the same landscape that is a constant point of reference in Dalí’s work: the Portlligat bay.

Pioneers of Prosperity

Pioneers of Prosperity is an awards programme for entrepreneurs in Africa, the Caribbean and Central America that have created wealth and invested in their society. Its aim is to recognise and support today's successful enterprises and inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs, leading to stronger, more sustainable development in these regions. Winning companies receive up to $100,000 to invest in their business.
The first awards ceremony took place in 2007 in Kigali, Rwanda. The second African award ceremony took place in Kigali, Rwanda on November 19, 2008 and awards will be held in the Caribbean and Central America in early 2009.
Objectives.
The stated objective of Pioneers of Prosperity is "to foster greater prosperity in developing countries by influencing the assumptions and behaviors of entrepreneurs, policymakers, academics and business leaders". The program highlights successful models of enterprise-based development, thereby creating a stronger culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. Specifically, the program aims to do the following: 
1 - Identify competitive small and medium-size companies that are developing promising business models; 
2 - Invest in these firms through award prize money; 
3 - Diffuse the ideas, attitudes, ands practices that set these firms apart from their peers so they may serve as role models to aspiring entrepreneurs in the region; and
4 - Focus international organizations on the private sector as a means for economic development.
Africa Awards.
In 2007, the inaugural Legatum Pioneers of Prosperity Africa Awards launched in five African Great Lakes countries. More than 450 firms competed from which five winners and one grand prize winner were selected. The winners received their awards in Kigali, Rwanda by His Excellency, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda on November 30, 2007.
The grand prize winner was Kenyan firm AAA Growers, which provides fresh-cut vegetables to the U.K. market; additional winners included Kencall, Enterprise Urwibutso, Virtual City Limited, Good African Coffee, and Tele-10.
The 2007 program was captured in a documentary ‘Unlocking Africa’ made by award-winning filmmaker Jeff Zimbalist.
In 2008, the Legatum Pioneers of Prosperity Awards (Africa) expanded to 10 countries across Africa and received almost 1,500 applications from small and medium-sized enterprise in Botswana, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda. On November 19, 2008, the second Legatum Pioneers of Prosperity Africa Grand Prize was awarded to Superflux International, a security printing solutions company in Nigeria; other prizes were awarded to firms from Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda. The presentation ceremony was attended by H.E. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of Rwanda, and the guest of honour, H.E. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of Kenya, who awarded the Grand Prize.
The cash prizes for the Africa awards totaled US$350k and the winners were selected by a jury process from a pool of applicants evaluated according to the COW-F framework.
Caribbean and Central America Awards.
In February 2009, the Pioneers of Prosperity Awards launched in seven countries in the Caribbean, including Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. Later in 2009, Pioneers of Prosperity will launch across Central America, including the countries of Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.
The competition is open to all private sector small and medium enterprises (SMEs) based in the participating countries that have between 5 and 250 employees and annual revenues of US$100,000 and $5,000,000. The prizes for the Caribbean awards will total to $600,000, including a $100,000 grand prize winner and several smaller prizes ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. Just under 600 firms applied for the competition, which closed on March 23, 2009. The winners will be selected by a jury process from a pool of applicants evaluated according to the COW-F framework, and the prizes awarded in June 2009.
Theoretical background.
The Pioneers of Prosperity program uses the COW-F framework, conceived of by development expert and author Michael Fairbanks, to identify promising business models. The COW-F framework asserts that a good business model provides a unique value proposition to all of its stakeholders: Customers, Owners, Workers, and Future generations.
Customers receive a product they value at a competitive price; Owners receive an above average return for their investment; Workers receive a high and rising standard of living; and all of this is achieved without eroding the social or environment fabric for future generations, and ideally while investing in the broader public good.
According to Fairbanks, COW-F firms understand the correlation between satisfied employees and a successful business. Satisfied employees take pride in their place of work, have higher degrees of loyalty to their employer and have a vested interest in seeing the company succeed. The assumption is that by investing in their employees, through both rising wages and employee training, employers find themselves with happier employees that are more productive. Highly productive employees are a critical component of a successful business.
The ‘Pioneers of Prosperity’ program identifies and rewards outstanding emerging market COW-F entrepreneurs. By publicizing their stories and rewarding their efforts, it is hoped that the benefits of the COW-F model can be disseminated across the developing world. As a condition of the grant, the winners use award proceeds for improvement of the skills and capabilities necessary to further enhance the COW-F model for their workers. The training may focus on both management and technical skills, including: financial management, market research techniques, product design, sales, and customer service.
Funders.
Pioneers of Prosperity is funded by the multilateral development agency Inter-American Development Bank, the private equity firm Legatum, the John Templeton Foundation and the philanthropy Social Equity Venture Fund (SEVEN). It is implemented by the OTF Group, an international economic development consulting firm.

Zero-width space

The zero-width space (ZWSP) is a non-printing character used in computerized typesetting to indicate word boundaries to text processing systems when using scripts that do not use explicit spacing, or after characters (such as the slash) that are not followed by a visible space but after which there may nevertheless be a line break. Normally, it is not a visible separation, but it may expand in passages that are fully justified.
Usage.
In HTML pages, the zero-width space can be used as a potential line-break in long words as an alternative to the codice_1 tag. However, the zero-width space is not supported in all web browsers such as old versions of Internet Explorer (versions 6 and earlier). 
To show the effect of the zero-width space, the following words have been separated with zero-width spaces:
Lorem​Ipsum​Dolor​Sit​Amet,​Consectetur​Adipisicing​Elit,​Sed​Do​Eiusmod​Tempor​Incididunt​Ut​Labore​Et​Dolore​Magna​Aliqua.​Ut​Enim​Ad​Minim​Veniam,​Quis​Nostrud​Exercitation​Ullamco​Laboris​Nisi​Ut​Aliquip​Ex​Ea​Commodo​Consequat.​Duis​Aute​Irure​Dolor​In​Reprehenderit​In​Voluptate​Velit​Esse​Cillum​Dolore​Eu​Fugiat​Nulla​Pariatur.​Excepteur​Sint​Occaecat​Cupidatat​Non​Proident,​Sunt​In​Culpa​Qui​Officia​Deserunt​Mollit​Anim​Id​Est​Laborum.
On browsers supporting zero-width spaces, resizing the window will re-break the above text only at word boundaries.
Encoding.
The zero-width space character is encoded in Unicode as .
In groff, it is written as a reverse solidus followed by a colon:
codice_2.
The LaTeX equivalent would be codice_3.
Its semantics and HTML implementation are comparable to but different from the soft hyphen.

Soldiering On

Soldiering On is a dramatic monologue written by Alan Bennett in 1987 for television, as part of his Talking Heads series for the BBC. The series became very popular, moving onto BBC Radio, international theatre, becoming one of the best-selling audio book releases of all time and included as part of both the A-level and GCSE English syllabus. It was the fourth episode of the first series of Talking Heads.
Storyline.
Muriel (Stephanie Cole) is a strong woman, and always has been – a pillar of the community, a regular charity worker, and a volunteer for Meals on Wheels; and looking after her mentally ill daughter, Margaret, has fortified her resolve – so, after the death of her husband, Muriel is well-prepared to cope with the crisis. She adopts a brisk, cheerful approach: socialising with guests at the wake, giving her husband's belongings to various charitable causes, and deciding that she must devise an efficient plan to deal with her grief. Muriel's husband left her a considerable sum of money, and despite having been advised not to make any "big decisions," she soon agrees to hand over control of the money to their son Giles (who received nothing from the will.) Although it is clear to the audience that Giles is mismanaging the money, it comes as a surprise to Muriel when he loses her inheritance through poor investments. He reassures her there is nothing to worry about and the problem is simply "liquidity", but she is soon forced to sell her home and possessions and move to a small seaside town.
Muriel ends the story poor and alone, losing contact with her children, Margaret having shown a great improvement and living an almost normal life after a spell of psychiatric treatment. It is implied that Margaret's mental illness was the result of sexual molestation by her father. Muriel appears to be aware of this and also begins to wonder if she contributed to her husband's end with ""all those death-dealing breakfasts."" She is now reduced to using the Meals on Wheels service she had once commanded, and her only entertainment is free cassette tapes from the library. Still, she instructs the audience not to think of her story as a tragic one - ""I'm not that sort of woman.""

Geriatric rheumatology

Geriatric rheumatology is the branch of medicine that studies rheumatologic disorders in elderly (joints, muscles & other structures around the joints). Sometimes it is called Gerontorheumatology.
Origin.
The geriatric rheumatology clinic provides evaluation and management services to patients with various musculoskeletal and soft tissue disorders. Evaluation of the elderly patient is often complex due to the many comorbid conditions encountered in this population often compounded by cognitive disorders, functional decline, polypharmacy and limited social supports.
Training & education programs.
During training physicians observe and participate in the diagnosis and management of various rheumatologic conditions which contribute to elderly functional decline including connective tissue disorders, crystal diseases, osteoarthritis and other soft tissue disorders. They also learn to differentiate these various clinical conditions, gain an understanding of the various treatment options available, as well as learn how to work with a multidisciplinary team of health professionals.
Some Departments of Medicine offer a three-year combined Geriatric-Rheumatology Fellowship, which is composed of a year of clinical geriatrics and training in clinical epidemiology and health services research, a year of clinical rheumatology and an opportunity to explore scholarly geriatric-rheumatology research projects in the third year.
Many books and resources are available dedicated to geriatric rheumatology.
Many geriatricians and rheumatologists are dedicated to this new subspecialty. Some internal medicine departments have established a separate geriatric rheumatology clinics.
Organisation & societies.
International Society of Geriatric Rheumatology was established to help advancing research in the area of geriatric rheumatology and improve the quality of management of rheumatologic disorders in elderly.

Synopsis.
Susan (Maggie Smith) is the wife of a vicar, living in a small village near Leeds. Her husband is a popular local figure, well respected and he also seems to collect adoring middle aged and elderly women because of his status as the vicar, all of whom fuss and fawn over him and seem to passive aggressively compete with Susan for his time and affection.
Susan is bored with her husband and unhappy with her life, although she is passive in this unhappiness other than her alcoholism. She has run up a debt with the local shop because of her constant buying of sherry, she dislikes the community she lives in and only gives the bare minimum of attention to her own parish duties as the vicars wife.
During a difficult afternoon trying to arrange the church flowers with several of the other women, Susan goes into the church's backroom and drinks the communion wine hidden in the cupboard. She then returns to the others, challenges one of their flower arrangements which involves spiky teasle plants and ends up falling down the altar stairs and hitting her head. The women take this opportunity to take Susan home, fuss over her husband and look through everything in the house under pretext of getting the vicar his lunch and "helping" Susan.
On the next Sunday service, the vicar discovers the loss of the wine and has to celebrate the host in a bottle of Benylin, which Susan says will be fine since it is red, sweet and sticky. Susan starts buying her sherry from Ramesh, an Asian grocer in Leeds who is young, attractive and talks to her about his culture and life - he is married but his wife is under 16 so not permitted to join him in England. The Bishop comes to lunch and Susan accidentally spills Carnation milk on him, which is written off as an accident although Susan was clearly responsible. A lock has been put on the communion wine cupboard in the vestry.
During another visit to Ramesh, Susan begins an affair with him and finally discovers some happiness and enjoyment in life until Ramesh asks her if she drinks because of his colour or whether she has a problem with alcohol.
This pushes Susan towards recovery and she begins to attend AA meetings & attempts to be more honest with her husband. Ramesh returns to India to bring his wife home, selling his shop so that they can begin elsewhere. The vicar thinks that God is responsible for Susan's recovery, and his Bishop recommends him for a higher position in the church thanks to his "knowing what trials parishioners face". Susan however still remains passive, knowing that her recovery is due to Ramesh and that God and her husband have little to do with it.

Storyline.
Irene Ruddock is a single, middle-aged woman living near Bradford and is not afraid to speak, or rather write, her mind. She frequently writes to her MP, the police, the chemist - everyone she can, to remedy the social ills she sees around her. Irene becomes suspicious of a neighbouring couple whom she suspects of neglecting their child, and tries to raise these suspicions to her doctor, who instead offers her a prescription (presumably some kind of anti-depressant or anti-psychotic medication) to help her forget her worries. Irene is eventually questioned by police after having written many abusive letters to the family, who, it emerges, were not neglecting the child but visiting him in hospital where he has just died of leukaemia. It is also revealed that Irene harassed the chemist through a series of letters (accusing his wife of being a prostitute) and finally had a court order taken out against her after a man she had accused of child molestation had a nervous breakdown. For her latest misconduct Irene receives a suspended sentence and is issued with social workers who try to help her find other interests; but she is eventually gaoled after starting a new letter-writing campaign.
In prison, Irene makes new friends and develops a thriving social life, taking classes and gaining new skills in a secretarial course. She states that she feels truly happy and free for the first time in years, perhaps for the first time in her life.

USS Canonicus (ID-1696)

The second USS "Canonicus" was the Southern Pacific freighter "El Cid" temporarily converted for planting the World War I North Sea Mine Barrage. Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company launched "El Cid" at Newport News, Virginia on 7 October 1899 for service between New York City and Gulf of Mexico seaports of New Orleans and Galveston, Texas. The United States Shipping Board took control of the ship from Southern Pacific Steamship Company in 1917. 
She was fitted out for United States Navy service by Morse Dry Dock and Repair Company at Brooklyn, New York. Work began on 22 November 1917. Gun platforms were added for two anti-aircraft guns forward and a 5"/51 caliber gun aft. The minelaying conversion enabled her to carry mines on three decks, and included six Otis elevators individually capable of transferring two mines every 20 seconds from the storage decks to the launching deck. Stern ports were cut for launching the mines and the rudder quadrant was raised to give adequate clearance. Watertight subdivision was improved by strengthening existing bulkheads and building two new bulkheads to divide the largest compartments so the ship might stay afloat if only one compartment were flooded. Quarters were enlarged to accommodate messing and berthing arrangements for a crew of about 400. The main machinery was overhauled and auxiliary machinery was added for the elevators, for heating the berthing spaces, for refrigerated food storage, for additional fresh water distilling capacity, for magazine sprinklers and galley and washroom plumbing, and enlarged electric generators for lighting and radio communications. Existing coal bunkers on the third deck were replaced with a bunker in the hold forward of the boiler room with chutes to load coal over the mines. Larger boats and heavier anchors required larger davits and anchor windlass, and the mines required specialized handling machinery. 
USS "Canonicus" was commissioned on 2 March 1918 with Commander Thomas L. Johnson, USN, in command. "Canonicus" cleared Newport, Rhode Island on 12 May 1918 and reached Inverness, Scotland on 27 May 1918. While operating as part of Mine Squadron 1 from 7 June until the close of the war on 11 November 1918, "Canonicus":
"Canonicus" returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 3 January 1919 and was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force on 7 February 1919. She made three voyages as a troop transport between the United States East Coast and France, returning 4,166 troops to the United States. "Canonicus" was decommissioned on 7 August 1919 and returned to the Southern Pacific Steamship Company.
Big Four.
In the words of British Rear Admiral Lewis Clinton-Baker, the North Sea mine barrage was the "biggest mine planting stunt in the world's history." The United States converted eight civilian steamships as minelayers for the 100,000 mines manufactured for the barrage. The largest of these were four freighters owned by Southern Pacific Steamship Company. Southern Pacific Transportation Company had evolved from the First Transcontinental Railroad to become the dominant transportation provider in California. Owners of the original Central Pacific Railroad were known as the Big Four. Sailors similarly referred to these former Southern Pacific ships as the Big Four.

Water supply and sanitation in Scotland

"This article was written in November 2008. Please feel free to further update if necessary."
Public water supply and sanitation in Scotland is characterised by universal access and generally good service quality. Water and sewerage services are provided by a single public company, Scottish Water. The economic water industry regulator is the Water Industry Commission for Scotland. It "promotes the interests of water and sewerage customers in Scotland by making sure that householders and businesses receive a high-quality service and value for money by setting prices, monitoring Scottish Water’s performance and facilitating competition in the water industry". The environmental regulator is the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Drinking water standards and wastewater discharge standards are determined by the EU (see EU water policy).
Service quality.
The Water Commission measures the service quality of Scottish Water using an overall performance assessment (OPA) index, which takes into account unplanned supply interruptions, pressure, drinking water quality, responses to written complaints, ease of telephone contact, sewer floodings, sewage treatment works compliance and leakage. While Scottish Water's OPA score improved from 162 in 2003-2004 to 232 in 2006-2007, it remained below the average of 294 for water companies in England and Wales in 2006-2007.
Infrastructure.
Scottish Water operates and maintains over 47,000 kilometres of water pipes, 50,000 kilometres of sewer pipes, 1837 waste water treatment works (including 1206 septic tanks) and 297 water treatment works plus pumping stations, sludge treatment centres, reservoirs.
History.
In the past, twelve Regional and Island Councils (local authorities) were responsible for water supply in Scotland, alongside other local services. Unlike in England and Wales, the assets of the industry were owned by local governments, many of which were not governed by the Conservative Party at the time of the water privatisation in England and Wales in 1989. However, in the early 1990s, the UK government merged the Regional and Island Councils into three regional public service providers to prepare them for privatisation. In 1994, voters in half of Scotland defeated the privatisation proposal in the Strathclyde water referendum.
In 2002 the Scottish Parliament passed the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002 merging the three providers into a single one, Scottish Water. In 2005 it passed the Water Services etc. (Scotland) Act 2005 allowing competition for "retail services" - defined as metering, billing and customer service - to business customers beginning in 2008, while wholesale services - defined as providing water and removing wastewater - remain a public monopoly.
Financial aspects and efficiency.
Tariffs According to Scottish Water, the charge for the average household bill in Scotland in 2008/09 (£310) is lower than the average household bill in England and Wales (£330).
Investments In 2006/07 Scottish Water invested £413 million in its infrastructure, equivalent to about £80 per capita. According to the regulator, its planned investments per property for 2006-2010 are much larger than those of English water companies of the same size.
Efficiency In 2007 operating costs of Scottish Water were 40% lower than those of the three former water authorities in 2002. Its customer service is also considerably better. According to the regulator, Scottish Water's achievement is "unprecedented in the UK water industry". The level of leakage at Scottish Water has declined from 1104 Megalitres (Ml)/day in 2005-2006 to 924 Ml/day in 2007-08. However, the regulator considers this level to be higher than the economic level of leakage. Scottish Water has also failed the annual regulatory targets for the reduction of leakage.

La Tour (comics)

La Tour is a graphic novel by Belgian comic artists François Schuiten and Benoît Peeters, the third volume of their ongoing "Les Cités Obscures" series. It was first published in serialized form in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine "À Suivre" (#96-106), and as a complete volume first in 1987 by Casterman. In English, it was published as "The Tower (Stories of the Fantastic)" in 1993 by NBM Publishing.
Background.
As the story takes place in the ancient history of the "Obscure World", "La Tour" is the one "Les Cités Obscures" album exhibiting the least connection to steampunk fiction. Instead, The Tower's design, architecture, and clothing show strong Medieval influences of time periods between the 10th and the 15th centuries, particularly Pre-Romanesque, Romanesque, Gothic, and early Renaissance art. The technology used is therefore more reminiscent of clockpunk.
Plot.
We are introduced to Giovanni Battista (whose visual appearance Schuiten based on Orson Welles playing Falstaff in "Chimes at Midnight"). Battista is a maintenance engineer in The Tower, a gigantic structure with many such engineers, each maintaining his own sector. The time is about 400 AT ("Age of The Tower"), which is the number of years since The Tower's ongoing construction has begun. Battista lives a solitary life alone in his sector, focused intently on his job and on following its established protocols. His world, like the graphic novel itself, is black and white. But over the years he loses contact with the other maintenance engineers and even with his superiors. His repeated requests for a resupply of materials needed to repair the structure are seemingly ignored. Thus, Battista's sector begins to fall into decay.
Worried about the increasingly decrepit state of his sector, Battista decides to leave his post and to inform his superiors in person. Although he begins the journey on foot, climbing down The Tower, he eventually builds a parachute to speed his descent. But the parachute is caught in an updraft, and Battista is taken even higher in The Tower. There he encounters an autonomous civilization whose technological and architectural level Schuiten locates exactly at the segue between Medieval Gothic art and the early Renaissance period. Like Battista, the inhabitants are following the protocols of the established bureaucracy, and patiently waiting for news from the base of The Tower while their sector decays. One inhabitant, Elias, has a collection of paintings. Unlike the rest of the graphic novel, these painting are in color, and Battista is fascinated by the scenes they depict: of nudity, of war, and most importantly of people motivated by their passions. Having failed to reach the base of The Tower, Battista decides to head upwards, intending to reach the top where pioneers and construction engineers are said to continually advance the building higher and higher.
As Battista reaches the top, he comes upon the shocking revelation that The Tower's continuous construction was abandoned years before. The pioneers apparently left in a hurry, taking everything of value and discarding what was too heavy to carry. The trail of discarded belongings leads Battista to a gigantic winch that was presumably used to lower the pioneers through the hollow center of The Tower to its base. At the bottom, Battista finds piles of riches thrown haphazardly about and abandoned, partially obscuring the exit. Near a discarded picture frame he glimpses some color—what Battista mistakes for a painting is in fact the world outside The Tower.
Battista leaves The Tower behind and gets swept up in a raging war at its base. He kills for the first time in his life, and eventually helps to lead a band of soldiers to victory as the The Tower collapses in the distance behind him. Battista makes a life for himself and rises to a position of some distinction, living happily ever after, but haunted by his memories of The Tower and by the stark contrast between its black-and-white world and the colorful life he now enjoys.

Eleanor Percy, Duchess of Northumberland

Eleanor Percy, Duchess of Northumberland (1820–1911) was the wife of Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland.
Biography.
Elearnor was born on 22 October 1820, the daughter of Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster and Lady Elizabeth Mary Leveson-Gower. She married Lord Prudhoe (later 4th Duke of Northumberland) on 27 August 1842, and it was considered an excellent marriage since his older brother Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland was childless after 26 years of marriage. He was born 1792, and was thus 28 years her senior and 50 years old at the time of the marriage. Prudhoe succeeded to the title on 11 February 1847. 
There were no children of the marriage. The Duchess was widowed on 12 February 1865, and died on 4 May 1911, aged 90, in Stanwick St John in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire.
For many details of her life see "The Lost Stanwick Hall: remnants of the Duchess Eleanor of Northumberland, her time and people" printed in Darlington, Co Durham in 2005. This was written as an accompaniment to an exhibition of her life after she was widowed during which time she was resident, for the most part, at Stanwick Hall, demolished in 1925.

KkStB Class 112

The Austrian steam locomotive class, the kkStB Class 112 was an express train tank engine operated by the Imperial Austrian State Railways ("kaiserlich-königliche österreichische Staatsbahnen" or "kkStB").
In order for the kkStB to provide a fast feeder service to express train stations, a requirement arose for small, fast locomotives. Karl Gölsdorf designed Class 112 for this purpose. The engines were well built, enabled a top speed of 100 km/h to be attained for short periods of time and could haul 100 tonnes continuously at 80 km/h.
On their deliver in 1907 by Krauss in Linz the two engines were fitted with a small smokebox superheater, that was later removed.
The small locomotives were initially used to haul newspaper trains between Vienna and Linz. Later they hauled the shuttle ("Pendler") between Hütteldorf and Unterpurkersdorf, a connecting line to the Vienna Stadtbahn, where they travelled in the centre of the train.
Number 112.02 was retired in 1937, whilst 112.01 went into the Deutsche Reichsbahn as number 69 011 where it was withdrawn from service in 1942.

Glyn Prosser

Glyn Prosser (27 November 1907–13 November 1972) was a Welsh international rugby union flanker who played club rugby for Neath and was capped four times for Wales. An aggressive wing forward, Prosser is best known for being a member of the Wales team that beat the touring New Zealanders in 1935.
Rugby career.
Prosser first played rugby for his home town, Glynneath, before moving to first class side Neath. It was with Neath that Prosser first played against international opposition, when he was chosen for a joint Neath / Aberavon team to face the touring South Africans in 1931. It was a very close game that was 3-3, when in a final attack, the South Africans scored the winning try.
Prosser trialed for the Wales team as early as the 1931/32 season but did not gain his first cap until the 1934 Home Nations Championship, when he was selected to face England. The match was played at the Cardiff Arms Park under the captaincy of first time international John Evans, and the inexperienced Welsh team were poor in comparison to England. Out of 13 new caps on the day, five, including Evans, never played for Wales again, but Prosser returned in the next two games of the tournament, now led by the more reliable Claude Davey. Although Wales won these two games, Prosser was not reselected for the next years Championship.
In 1935, Prosser was given another chance to face international tourist when Neath joined up with Aberavon again to face the touring All Blacks. Although the joint team lost to New Zealand Prosser brought his familiar style of offensive forward play through the All Black back division, and did enough to gain the favour of the Welsh selectors. Prosser played his final game for Wales one week later when he was chosen to face the same touring New Zealanders. It was a famous win for Wales, even though they lost their hooker with a broken neck ten minutes before the end of the game.
In 1936, Prosser severed his ties with rugby union by signing for professional rugby league club Huddersfield.

BBÖ Class 12

The steam locomotive class BBÖ 12 was an express train tank locomotive class with the Federal Railway of Austria (BBÖ).
Convinced by the performance of the kkStB-Class 112 the BBÖ decided in 1934 to procure tank engines for regional express services as well. For reasons of cost, however, they achieved this by converting 0-6-0 tank locomotives built in 1898 by Krauss/Linz). One unit was converted by the Lokomotivfabrik Floridsdorf in 1934 and another in 1937. Locomotives 97.153 and 97.152 were used for the conversion. The boiler and the valve gear were used unchanged. Oil-firing was provided, the tank for which was installed on the rear section of the boiler barrel, and enabled one-man operation. The engines were given a special livery with the water tanks and driver's cab being painted light green.
The little locomotives proved themselves well, but no more were converted, because from 1935 the BBÖ DT 1 was available for short express trains.
In 1938 the Deutsche Reichsbahn took the engines over as 69 001 and 69 002. Only the latter was still around after the Second World War. It became ÖBB 69.02 in the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) and was used on a bridge inspection train. This engines is still preserved today.

A Chip in the Sugar

A Chip in the Sugar is a dramatic monologue written by Alan Bennett in 1987 for television, as part of his Talking Heads series for the BBC. The series became very popular, moving onto BBC Radio, international theatre, becoming one of the best-selling audio book releases of all time and included as part of both the A-level and GCSE English syllabus. It was the first episode of the first series of Talking Heads and the only one which featured Alan Bennett as a character.
Storyline.
Middle-aged Graham Whittaker (who we learn is a repressed homosexual with a history of mental health problems) finds life becoming complicated as his mother, Mam, with whom he still lives, reunites with an old flame named Frank Turnbull. Graham becomes increasingly disturbed when Mr Turnbull, who has outspoken and right-wing opinions which conflict with Graham´s muddled liberalism, becomes an ever-increasing influence on Mam, taking her to a 'common' café in which Graham notices a chip in the sugar. After a brief courtship, Mr Turnbull proposes to Graham's mother. It is suggested that Graham moves out of his childhood home and into a hostel. But Mr Turnbull is hiding a secret. He is already married and, despite this, has already proposed to various women before Mam. When Graham finds out, he is vastly relieved and triumphantly confronts his mother with the information. Her hopes of happiness are destroyed, but a safe, stultifying `normality´ has been restored in the existence of Graham and his mother.
Reception.
Many have praised Alan Bennett's portrayal of the character of Graham, with David Tuck saying "His Bennett's understanding of a northern English dialect is exemplary."
For his role in the episode, Alan Bennett received a nomination at the 1989 BAFTA Awards, for Best Actor.

Plas Mawr

Plas Mawr () is an Elizabethan townhouse in Conwy, North Wales, dating from the 16th century. The property was built by Robert Wynn, a member of the local gentry, following his marriage to his first wife, Dorothy Griffith. Plas Mawr occupied a plot of land off Conwy's High Street and was constructed in three phases between 1576 and 1585 at a total cost of around £800. Wynn was known for his hospitality, and the household was supported by Wynn's local dairy herds, orchards and gardens. On his death he laid out complex instructions for dividing his estate; the resulting law-case took years to resolve, effectively preventing the redevelopment of the house and preserving it in its original condition.
After 1683 Plas Mawr passed into the hands of the Mostyn family and ceased to be used as a family home. It was rented out for various purposes during the 18th and 19th centuries, including for use as a school, cheap lodgings and finally as the headquarters of the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art. In the 20th century the house became increasingly well known for its preserved Elizabethan architecture, but the costs of maintenance grew considerably and its condition deteriorated. The Welsh heritage agency Cadw took over the management of the property in 1993 and carried out an extensive, 42-month long restoration project at a total cost of £3.3 million. With many of its rooms redecorated to resemble their condition in 1665, and replanted Renaissance gardens, it is now run as a tourist attraction.
Architecturally, Plas Mawr is almost unchanged from the 16th century, and the historian Rick Turner considers the house to be "the finest surviving town house of the Elizabethan era". Plas Mawr shows a blend of continental Renaissance and local North Wales influences, with an innovative floor-plan and architectural detailing. The house still retains much of its original plasterwork, which incorporates symbols, badges and heraldry, which the historian Peter Smith has described as "the most perfect and the most complete memorial to Elizabethan Wales." The architecture of the house influenced other contemporary projects in North Wales, and was later copied during the 19th and 20th centuries in buildings around the town of Conwy, including the local police station and nearby hotel.
History.
16th – 17th centuries.
Plas Mawr was built in the town of Conwy between 1576 and 1585 by Robert Wynn. Robert came from a prosperous local family and entered the service of first Sir Walter Stonor and then Sir Philip Hoby, both administrators and senior officials to King Henry VIII. Robert fought and was injured at the Siege of Boulogne in 1544, took part in military campaigns in Scotland and traveled extensively across Europe. He invested in land across North Wales and married his first wife, Dorothy Griffith, a member of the local gentry, in 1570. Once married, Robert needed a suitable house and chose to settle in Conwy, a prosperous town that was known in the 16th century for its genteel society.
In 1570, Robert paid Hugh Mershe £200 for an existing "mansion house" in Conwy, positioned in the middle of a burgage plot on what is now Crown Lane. More land to the north of this was purchased from a Richard Peake in 1576 for £40, and work then began on the north wing of Plas Mawr, which was completed by the following year. Mershe's former house was pulled down to allow the preparation of the foundations of the rest of the building, including the digging of fresh drains. Robert lived in the completed north wing until 1580, when the central and south ranges were built, finishing the main part of Plas Mawr.
Robert went on to rent further land around the north of Plas Mawr. The land at the south end of the burgage, however, facing onto the High Street, belonged to a Robert Laythwood, who had a house there. Wynne purchased this in 1585, probably for the relatively high price of £40, and demolished it to enable the final phase of development, using the space to build a gatehouse that formed the new entrance to Plas Mawr. Further small pieces of land were bought on the north-west side of the house and converted into an ornamental garden, bringing the total cost of the land to around £300. The result was the grandest Elizabethan town house in Wales at the time.
These three phases of house construction – 1576–77, 1580 and 1585 – were probably overseen by several different senior craftsmen, possibly working to an original plan determined by a surveyor or mason working at the English royal court. Judging by the details of the roof design, a single master carpenter may have been used for all three parts of the build; he probably worked elsewhere across the region during these years, including on 15 other houses and two churches. Both of the first two phases of work were probably conducted by the same team of plasterers, possibly from London, and they used as much as of lime plaster on the rendering. Timber and slates were brought down the Conwy valley for the house, with grey Silurian grit rubble quarried from the hills near the town, and finer sandstone brought from nearby Deganwy. The total of the building work was probably around £500.
Entertainment and hospitality were important to a gentleman's 16th-century social status and, according to his nephew, the antiquarian John Wynn, Robert Wynn kept a "worthy plentiful house". The household was supported by milk from Wynn's own dairy herds, and by food from the orchards, gardens and a fish trap that he owned around the town. The house had its own brewing, baking and dairy facilities, and further supplies were bought in from regional merchants.
Dorothy died in 1586 and Robert married Dorothy Dymock, with whom he had seven children at Plas Mawr. When Robert died in 1598 he left a complex will that led to legal disputes between the family and the executor, Sir Roger Mostyn. The legal case effectively halted any further development of the house, by now the most prominent in Conwy, until its resolution in 1630. The property passed to Robert's grandson, another Robert Wynn, in 1637, and onto his daughter, Elin in 1683. By 1665, the house was equipped to a quality and style that would have put it only just behind the houses of the major gentry families in Caernarfonshire. Elin then married into the Wynne family, and made little use of the house, and it ultimately passed by marriage into the Mostyn family.
18th – 19th centuries.
The Mostyns' principal residence was Mostyn Hall in Flintshire and so the family rented out Plas Mawr to various tenants during the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 18th century the gatehouse was used as a courthouse and the main house as cheap housing. In the 19th century, parts of the house were converted into a school and space for other small businesses, as well as still being used for domestic accommodation: in 1881, the house had 25 residents. Minor changes were made to Plas Mawr in the process, such as the installation of partition walls to subdivide the larger rooms, but it remained largely intact. The Mostyns offered the house for sale in 1870, as part of a package of land including Bodysgallen Hall, but there were no offers.
By the 1880s, the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art became concerned about the condition of Plas Mawr, and in 1887 Lord Mostyn agreed to lease the building to the Academy for use as their headquarters. The architects Arthur and Herbert Baker were commissioned to survey the building, conduct repairs and remove some of the post-17th century alterations, and J. R. Furness then carried out conservation work on much of the plasterwork. The Victoria Gallery was built onto the north-west side of the house to hold artistic exhibitions, and a weather vane was added to the top of the building to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.
20th – 21st centuries.
By the early 20th century, Plas Mawr's historical significance was increasingly well understood, but the costs of maintaining the house grew considerably. By the middle of the century, the finer sandstone had corroded and the timber beams were deteriorating; a 1956 survey described them as "much decayed". The plaster ceilings were bowing and coming away from their timbers. The Academy of Art sought government and private assistance to undertake temporary and partial repairs, but these were insufficient and in 1993 it moved into new accommodation and the property was passed into the control of the state, under the management of the Welsh heritage agency Cadw.
Cadw carried out a major restoration project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis. The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and lime washed. Large parts of the property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, with the exception of the attic, which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and comfort of the original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically bleak and austere. Other sections of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.
The restoration included installing original and replica interior furnishings, using wall hangings woven from Kidderminster stuff and Dornix. In what historical consultant Charles Kightly has praised as a "brave and successful" decision, much of the plasterwork was repainted, using reversible techniques, to resemble its 17th-century condition. In total the project cost £3.3 million, and won the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Building Conservation Award. Further work followed in 2006 to restore the gardens, again attempting to replicate the style prevalent in 1665.
In the 21st century the house is operated as a tourist attraction by Cadw. The historian Rick Turner considers Plas Mawr to be "the finest surviving town house of the Elizabethan era" and it is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument.
Architecture.
Influences.
Architecturally, Plas Mawr is almost unchanged from the 16th century, making it a very rare survival from this period. The architectural style is a product of the broader Renaissance influences prevalent across Europe at the time. Robert Wynn spent time in Germany, and the style of Plas Mawr makes use of North German Gothic themes, particularly in its use of symmetry, the pedimented windows at the front of the house, faceted finials and crow-stepped gables. These features were already popular in England when the house was built, and indeed Plas Mawr is very similar in design to Eastbury Manor House, the two possibly being based off the same architectural plan. Some of these features had already begun to spread into Wales – crow-stepped gables, for example, were already being used in Flintshire by the 1580s – but others were ground breaking in Wales, such as the use of ovolo-moulded and dormer windows. Nonetheless, Robert Wynn was only an emerging member of the gentry, and his house was not as large or as sophisticated as contemporary grander Renaissance properties built in larger rural settings.
Some of the house's architecture also reflects the influences from contemporary buildings across North Wales, in particular Gwydir Castle, built by Robert Wynn's father John. Plas Mawr lacks a fashionable long gallery, for example, which was popular in England at the time, and was already beginning to appear in Welsh houses. Instead, it has a rear turret, or belvedere, which is raised prominently above the height of the rest of the house, overlooking the town: this was a slightly antiquated feature, but was widely used in other Wynn family properties, including Bodysgallen Hall. The design of Plas Mawr influenced other buildings in North Wales at the time, including the redecoration of Gwydir Castle, Maenan Hall further up the Conwy valley, Plas Mawr in Caernarfon and Hen Blas in Beaumaris. It also later shaped the architecture of 19th- and 20th-century buildings in Conwy itself, surviving examples of which include the town's police station and the Castlebank Hotel.
Layout.
Modern visitors typically enter the house from the High Street to the south, passing through the gatehouse, across the lower courtyard into the hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's gatehouse was only the third such entrance building to be built in North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed to show off the house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors. Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.
The main house forms an "H"-shape, with a north and a south wing joined in the middle, all facing onto an upper courtyard. The upper courtyard was key to the way that the main house functioned: it linked almost all the ground floor rooms in the house, as well as providing access to the cellars, and gave an impressive view of the turret towers. In the south wing was the hall and the buttery, with the red and white chambers above them. Probably when Plas Mawr was first built, and certainly by 1665, the hall would have been used to meet ordinary visitors and for servants' meals, rather than forming the main room of the house; the wooden benches and table on display are original to the property. Traditionally, the service rooms in houses had been placed at the far end of the main hall, but Plas Mawr departed from this design. The service area, including the kitchen and pantry, was instead placed in the centre of the building, between the parlour and the hall; this radical redesign was copied at nearby Hafod Lwyfog. The restored kitchen is equipped with a "batterie de cuisine", with a combination of original and replica equipment.
Above these rooms was the great chamber, the main room which formed the ceremonial centre of the house. In the north wing was the brewhouse and the parlour, with two chambers above them, the latter possibly used by Dorothy Wynn as her bedroom. The private bedrooms for the family and guests were each equipped with a fireplace, an important status symbol in the period. The roof attics of the house contained a great deal of space for accommodating the household servants. The attic above the great chamber has a grand timber roof with arch-braced collar trusses, joined using an unusual system called "double pegging", which is only used in the Conwy valley during the late 16th century. It appears that the great chamber's ceiling was originally supposed to be open, looking up to the timbers with the trusses visible, but a mistake in the construction of the walls meant that one side of the chamber no longer fitted smoothly with the timbers, creating an ugly appearance; a plaster ceiling was then added to hide the error.
The gardens behind the house may originally have resembled the gardens at Bodysgallen Hall, which were laid out in the Renaissance style popular across Europe. The slope of the land results in Plas Mawr's gardens forming the upper and lower terraces, and these have been replanted and restored in an attempt to show them as they might have appeared in 1665. The summerhouse is based on a version shown in a contemporary painting of Llanerch's gardens, and the flowerpots are modeled on those found in excavations at Tredegar House.
Plasterwork.
Seven rooms still possess elements of their original plasterwork, which the historian Peter Smith has described as "the most perfect and the most complete memorial to Elizabethan Wales", and their original wooden carved panels that line the walls. The plasterwork includes extensive heraldry, badges and symbols: in the upper north range alone, 22 different heraldic emblems are molded into the ceilings and walls. The gatehouse shows the royal arms, as do the great chamber and the parlour, probably because they were intended to host senior guests. The badges of numerous monarchs are included throughout the house, including those of Richard II, Richard III, Henry IV and Henry VII. The badges of other prominent nobles, such as Robert Dudley, are also featured in the house.
The plasterwork in the parlour displays the arms of Robert Wynn himself, and the brewhouse shows the combined arms of the Wynn and Griffith families, which are generally given equal prominence throughout the house. Robert Wynn's arms are most prominent in the hall and the bedchambers, where the royal arms are smaller and less prominent. In the 16th century, Wynn's heraldry would probably have been echoed in the furnishings of the house, including the fabrics, cups and silverware. The plasterwork also incorporates a number of classical themes, but these are not as well executed as the badges and other emblems: the historian Rick Turner describes them as "rather token additions", and Smith considers this part of the decoration to be "naive".

Silver Streak (comics)

Silver Streak is a fictional superhero character created by Joe Simon, who first appeared in "Silver Streak Comics" #3 (March, 1940), from Lev Gleason Publications. He is believed to be the second-ever comic book superhero whose primary power is speed; All-American Publications' The Flash preceded him by two months. However, Silver Streak beat out National Allied Publications' Johnny Quick (who debuted in 1941) as the first superhero whose two powers were speed and flight. Silver Streak has a kid sidekick called "Mercury" (soon changed to "Meteor"); he is also assisted by a hawk named "Whiz".
Publication history.
"Silver Streak Comics" was originally published by Arthur Bernhardt’s Rhoda Publications, and the title was inspired by Bernhardt's car, a Pontiac Silver Streak. With issue #3, the title was taken over by Lev Gleason Publications and Silver Streak himself first appeared. 
Silver Streak appeared in "Silver Streak Comics" until issue #19 (March, 1942); the title itself ended with #22, and was renamed "Crime Does Not Pay". Also during this run, Silver Streak appeared in Lev Gleason's "Daredevil" #1.
In 1945, Silver Streak appeared in the one and only issue of "Dime Comics", and then in the 23rd and final issue of the briefly revived "Silver Streak Comics". Since then, this character has fallen into the public domain. In 2008, he appeared in issue #141 of "The Savage Dragon", along with a score of other Golden Age heroes.
In 2008, Silver Streak appeared in flashbacks in issue #0 of Dynamite Entertainment’s "Project Superpowers", a title that uses mostly public domain Golden Age characters. In the one-shot "Project Superpowers: Chapter Two Prelude", it was stated that Silver Streak will appear in future stories in this line; indeed, he appeared in the related Dynamite miniseries "The Death-Defying ’Devil".
Editor Erik Larsen's "Next Issue Project" (Image Comics) published "Silver Streak Comics" "#24" in December 2009. Silver Streak himself appeared in one of the stories, written and illustrated by Paul Grist.
Fictional biography.
Lev Gleason Publications.
In 1940, a taxicab driver (name unknown) was hypnotized by a mysterious swami (name unknown) into working for him as a race car driver; all of the swami’s previous drivers had been killed by giant insects, sent by a mad scientist named Dr. Katan. The cab driver was killed as well, but the swami used his mystical powers to bring him back to life, after which he gave the resurrected driver an injection of a “secret fluid” that gave him super-speed and the power of flight. Motivated by a strong desire to make the world a better place, he donned a colorful costume and fought against crime, Nazi spies, and The Claw, calling himself “Silver Streak” after the race car he was killed in. He had changed costumes a few times over the years, but one detail that remained constant was the arrowhead-shaped emblem on his chest with the shape-fitting “SS” inside it. (Curiously, most of his costumes had no silver coloring anywhere on them.)
He later learned that anyone who receives a transfusion of his blood gains super-speed; he gave this gift to a pet hawk named Whiz, and to a kid sidekick named Mickey O’Toole who first called himself "Mercury" but quickly changed it to "Meteor."
In "Silver Streak Comics" #5 (June, 1940), Jack Cole, who by this time was writing and drawing the character's adventures, directly addressed the readers and explained the hero’s motivations:
"Project Superpowers".
At some point after World War II, Silver Streak and other heroes were imprisoned in the mystical Urn of Pandora by the misguided Fighting Yank. Decades later the Urn was broken and the heroes released; Silver Streak emerged (wearing a red and silver costume similar to his original one) just in time to aid his former ally The Death-Defying ’Devil against a terrorist attack. Exactly what part this hero will play in the modern world remains to be seen.
"Living Legends".
The Metahuman Press serial "Living Legends" has introduced a new version of Silver Streak. This character is an Asian female, native to the fictional city of Riccapoor, home of The Claw.

Arthur D. Nicholson

Arthur D. Nicholson (7 June 1947 - 24 March 1985) was a United States Army military intelligence officer shot by a Soviet sentry while engaged in intelligence-gathering activities as part of an authorized Military Liaison Mission which operated under reciprocal U.S. - Soviet authority. Military Liaison Missions were ostensibly liaisons between the British, French and U.S. forces and the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (East Germany), but they had a known intelligence-gathering secondary mission and an important role to verify that offensive action was not being prepared. Reciprocal groups were authorized and operated by both the British, French and U.S. (in East Germany) and the Soviet Union (in West Germany) during the Cold War. Nicholson is officially regarded by the U.S. Department of Defense as having been a victim of murder and the final victim of the Cold War. Nicholson's death led to a U.S. - Soviet crisis and intense negotiations regarding the Military Liaison Missions.
Career as intelligence officer.
Nicholson was the son of a career navy officer. He graduated from Joel Barlow High School (Connecticut) in 1965 and achieved his bachelor's degree from Transylvania University in 1969 before joining the U.S. Army in 1970. Because of Nicholson's specialty in military intelligence (MI), his full career is not known in detail. He served as a Battalion S-2 (intelligence officer) with a missile battalion in Korea during 1973-74. From 1974 until 1979, he served with MI units in Frankfurt am Main and Munich in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Following this, Nicholson achieved a foreign area officer specialty. In 1980, he received his master's degree in Soviet and East European Studies from the Naval Postgraduate School and also attended a two year course in the Russian language at the Defense Language Institute. From 1980-82, Nicholson attended the U.S. Army's Russian Institute in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. In 1982, Nicholson was assigned to the U.S. Military Liaison Mission (USMLM) to the Commander-in-Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces Germany. Nicholson was promoted to major in 1983.
Death.
Although the Soviets later claimed that Nicholson died instantly, an autopsy indicated that he had actually bled to death while on the ground. Even as more senior Soviet personnel arrived, no medical aid for Nicholson was provided and no one checked his conditions for two hours after he was shot. After an attempt by the Soviets to perform an autopsy of Nicholson and a demand by General Glenn K. Otis that they return the body, Nicholson's body was returned to the U.S. Army at the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin. On March 30, 1985, Nicholson was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and the Legion of Merit as well as promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.
The Soviets contended that the response of Sergeant Ryabtsev, as a guard, had been appropriate in confronting an "unknown intruder who did not comply with the warnings of the sentry," and also stated that the area that Major Nicholson was in was "off-limits" to military liaison mission operations, as well as placing blame for the incident on the United States.
Aftermath.
At a subsequent meeting between General Otis and General Mikhail Zaitsev, the commander of Group of Soviet Forces Germany, General Otis made it clear that the U.S. Army believed that Nicholson's murder "officially condoned, if not directly ordered." Following this, a Soviet diplomat was ordered out of the U.S. and the U.S. canceled plans to jointly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe with the Soviets. The incident was also the first major foreign policy crisis faced by Mikhail Gorbachev as leader of the Soviet Union. The relatively muted U.S. response drew criticism from various sources, among them George Will.
Further negotiations over the shooting resulted in the Soviets issuing instructions to their personnel that the use of force or weapons against Allied military liaison personnel was strictly forbidden. However, in 1987, another incident took place in which Soviet soldiers fired at USMLM personnel, one of whom was wounded. In 1988, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov officially apologized for the death of Major Nicholson to U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci at a summit conference in Moscow.

Bernard Smith (editor)

Bernard Smith (September 20, 1907 - December 21, 1999) was an American literary editor, film producer, and literary critic. He is best remembered for his work at the Knopf publishing house, where he edited B. Traven, Raymond Chandler, and Dashiell Hammett, and Langston Hughes.
He attended City University of New York, and in 1928 began working for Alfred A. Knopf, where he was eventually made simultaneously editor-in-chief and managing editor. There Smith was Traven's first American editor, and took a free hand in revising Traven's initially rough English.
In 1939 Smith published his "Forces in American Criticism", a historical and critical survey of American literature and literary criticism from a Marxist perspective. Smith, though never a Communist Party member, was a committed Marxist; but the book was undogmatic and was well received in the mainstream literary academy, including favorable notice from critics such as Austin Warren.
Smith moved in 1947 to Hollywood, where he worked in the film industry, first for Samuel Goldwyn as a script editor. In 1950 he became an independent producer, working on films such as Elmer Gantry and How the West was Won. In 1963 he partnered as a producer with director John Ford, making films such as Cheyenne Autumn. 
In 1994 Smith published a memoir, "A World Remembered: 1925-1950". He edited volumes including "The Democratic Spirit: A Collection of American Writings From the Earliest Times to the Present Day" (1941), "Books That Changed Our Minds", and "The Holiday Reader" with Philip Van Doren Stern. His work also included studies published in the 1940s of the painters Moses Soyer and David Burliuk.

Norton 16H

The Norton 16H is a designation given to British motorcycles made between 1911 through to 1954 with various modifications and refers to a single cylinder Norton 490cc side valve engine with a bore and stroke of 79 x 100 mm. The H denotes the "Home" model as distinct from the "Colonial" export model. Norton was the main military motorcycle supplier prior to WW2 and one of the main suppliers of motorcycles to the British Army in World War II with a total of nearly 100,000 produced. British Army Nortons were also supplied to the Commonwealth forces such as Australian, New Zealand, India and the Canadian Army.
Development.
In 1911 James Lansdowne Norton entered a side valve 490cc single in the new 500cc Senior Class race of the Isle of Man TT. He was unplaced but the following year the motorcycle had been improved and won the Brooklands TT and set three world records. 
A drive chain was developed to replace the belt drive and although production was delayed by the First World War the Model 16 as it became known gained a Sturmey Archer gearbox and had a racing heritage that included 21 world records.
In 1921 Norton launched the 'Colonial' which was a Model 16 with higher ground clearance for use on poor quality roads, and designated the UK model as the 16H (for 'Home'). Despite its initial racing successes, the 16H was considered the "poor mans Norton" and never gained the superlative descriptions popular for the Norton racing machines.
WW2 WD16H.
A 16H was first offered for military evaluation in 1932, together with a Norton Model 18 and a Norton Model 19. It was found to be suitable and the Norton designers began working with the War Office on a range of developments and modifications. Military orders were placed for the 16H (designated WD16H for War Department use) from 1936 and continued throughout the course of the Second World War, setting a ten-year record for the longest time the War Office procured a single make of motorcycle. The entire staff of the Norton factory in Bracebridge Street Birmingham were needed to meet demand - even the racing team found themselves on the WD16H production line. A popular despatch machine, the WD16H was also used for training, reconnaissance, convoy control and escort duties.
Pre war, the RAF ordered many hundreds machines with a non driven 'box' or Model G (person carrying) side-car. 
Military Motorcycles left the Norton factory in Army Service Green, Khaki green, Khaki brown or Olive green, depending on colour specified at time of production. Prewar RAF machines (up to September 1939)were delivered in RAF Blue. Wartime RAF bikes were identically coloured as the "Army" bikes. A number of machines were painted sand 'desert camouflage' by local workshops in the Middle East and used in Palestine and the North Africa Campaign.
Military motorcycle Production.
The exact number of bikes and the manufacturing dates for the military machines produced after beginning of 1940 are not certain. The Norton Assembly Books for the military motorcycles are missing and probably destroyed.
Post war.
After the end of hostilities in 1945 there were many thousands of Norton Model 16H motorcycles all over the world. Some continued in use by the British and Commonwealth Armed forces until the end of the 1950s. Many were sold by the War Department to other armed forces, including the Dutch, Belgian, Danish, Greek and Norwegian Army which used the 16H throughout the 1950s. The remainder were sold to dealers who converted them to civilian colours and specifications.
The 16H and the Model 18 were also the first civilian models built by Norton after ending of the hostilities. In 1947 the machine received its final modification with telescopic forks, improving handling and giving the bike a more modern look, despite its age. The basic engine configuration proved popular with customers so Norton continued production until the mid-1950s when the fashion for twin cylinder motorcycles was prevalent. The 16H has a strong following of enthusiasts to this day.

<doc id="20043646" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20043646" title="John Lawrence Grattan">
John Lawrence Grattan

John Lawrence Grattan (1830? – August 19, 1854) was a mid-19th century US Cavalry officer, whose poor judgement and inexperience led to the Grattan massacre, which was a major instigator for the First Sioux War.
Early life and military career.
Grattan was born in Vermont, with little being known about his youth. He entered West Point in 1849, but did very poorly in his courses. Out of a class of 63, he finished 51st in French, and 43rd in Engineering, and failing mathematics altogether. Due to this, he was held back for a year. He applied himself the following year, finishing in the top third of his class for that year, only to again fall to the bottom third by his final year. In 1853, he graduated 36th out of a class of 55. Fellow graduates that year were James B. McPherson, Philip Sheridan, John Bell Hood, and John Schofield, all of whom would go on to fame during the American Civil War. Grattan, however, would achieve what fame he did receive due to a mistake during his very first command.
Military service on the frontier.
Initially, Grattan's poor performance at West Point left him without a definite assignment as an officer. For a time he was attached as a Brevet Second Lieutenant to the 6th Infantry. Given the customary three months leave following his graduation, Grattan was to have reported to Company G, 6th Infantry, at Fort Laramie, by October 1, 1853. However he failed to arrive until November 16, 1853. Within his first month, according to recorded reports from Post Surgeon Charles Page, Grattan received a reputation as being brash and boastful, while also giving off the impression that he was proud to serve in the army. The most disturbing trait, according to later accounts given by Page, was that Grattan displayed a disdain and dislike of the American Indians, despite having had no contact with them whatsoever up to that point, save seeing or meeting any who were in or around the post.
In July and August, 1854, new settlers moving west were plagued by raids from the Cheyenne, and calling on the army to do something about it. After one mid-August raid, settlers and traders encountered the Cheyenne warriors and pursued them, only to give up the chase before engaging. When Grattan was told this, he ridiculed the pursuers for fearing a confrontation with the Cheyenne. However, fear had little to nothing to do with the pursuers backing away. In reality, the settlers and traders who were pursuing the band of warriors had enough experience to recognize that the Cheyenne seemed to be baiting them into a possible ambush, thus they stopped their pursuit and reported the incident to Fort Laramie. During his ridicule of the men, Grattan stated that with 10 men he could defeat the entire Cheyenne nation.
Around this same time, in expectation that treaty annuities were soon to come, elements of the Lakota and Oglala had camped near the fort. Collectively the Sioux villages spread across a three mile area along the North Platte River. In the Native American camps, seasoned chiefs were struggling to control the more impatient young warriors, who were angered by the sight of their people starving, and over former broken promises by the whites. This would be compounded by the fact that Fort Laramie was at the time under the command of two young inexperienced officers, with one being a brash and totally untested young Second Lieutenant.
Tensions build.
The Indians were starving, and had been hungry for weeks awaiting the arrival of the annuities. By most reports, a Morman wagon train passing through had lost a straggling and lame cow. With any game being scarce in the area, the Sioux butchered the cow, and feasted on it. On August 18, 1854, the wagon train reached Fort Laramie, where the owner of the cow complained to Lt. Hugh Fleming that his cow had been stolen by the Indians. Reports vary, with the most reliable accounts stating that the owner noticed that the cow was missing, and returned to find that the Indians had butchered it. Lt. Fleming sent for Conquering Bear, the leader of the band where the cow had been butchered. Although Conquering Bear did not agree with all of the details in the Treaty of 1851, he did understand quite clearly that restitution was required for any property stolen from white settlers.
However, Conquering Bear also knew full well that, by the terms of the treaty, this was not a military matter, a fact that Lt. Fleming was not aware of. In reality, a matter of this sort should have been handled by John Whitfield, the Indian Agent assigned to the area, who was due to arrive within the week. Lt. Fleming wanted the brave who had initially killed the cow, High Forehead, arrested and delivered to the fort. By later Indian accounts, Conquering Bear entered the fort feeling confident that it was a minor affair and would be settled easily enough. However, as negotiations went on, it was quickly evident that Lt. Fleming's inexperience led to him being easily swayed and influenced, in this case by the civilians involved. Conquering Bear offered the owner the choice of any of his 60 horses, but the owner refused. The owner of the cow instead wanted $25 in cash.
By this time, Lt. Grattan had joined the negotiations, and immediately taken the side of the cow owner. Finding himself encouraged by Lt. Grattan's support, the formerly uncertain Lt. Fleming now demanded that High Forehead be arrested and brought to the fort. Alarmed, Conquering Bear attempted to explain that he had no authority over High Forehead, who was of another tribe and who was a guest in his village, therefore making it impossible by his tribes traditions to arrest him. Conquering Bear left the fort, riding back to the village. He had offered to show the soldiers the lodge of High Forehead, but insisted that he nor any of his people would assist in his arrest. Lt. Fleming was known to the Sioux, and had previously led an attack on a village, with minor casualties, but nonetheless enough to give Lt. Fleming confidence in dealing with the Indians.
Lt. Fleming led a detail into the village, but getting the feeling that an arrest would most certainly result in violence, Fleming initially made a solid decision, that being to await the arrival of the Indian Agent, John Whitfield. However, Lt. Grattan pressed Fleming when the latter returned to the fort, pushing him to allow Grattan to lead a force into the Indian village to arrest High Forehead. The next morning, Lt. Grattan was authorized by Lt. Fleming to depart with a force of 22 troopers. Another poor decision on the part of Fleming, as the entire post was made up of only 75 soldiers, and that day 32 were away on wood and hay cutting details. Thus, once Lt. Grattan left the fort, Fleming was left with only a small number of soldiers. To make matters worse, Lt. Grattan took 29 troopers, 7 more than Fleming had authorized, in addition to two artillery pieces. Sergeant Leodegar Schnyder, would later say he did not volunteer due to his belief that the two inexperienced officers were making bad decisions, and thus, not being ordered to go, he did not. Most of the soldiers accompanying Lt. Grattan were experienced soldiers. However, as their translator the detachment had Luciene Auguste, who spoke the Dakota language poorly, and who was despised by the Sioux. Lt. Grattan, having no prior experience with the Indians whatsoever, was now leading his small force into a major Sioux encampment which was filled with young warriors tired of what they considered to be lies told by the white government.
Grattan massacre.
Auguste was drinking heavily while en route to the encampment, and Lt. Grattan either did not notice or ignored this. By the time the party reached the encampment, Auguste was completely intoxicated. Lt. Grattan did notice this intoxication after their arrival, angrily taking Auguste's bottle and smashing it against his saddle. Had he ordered Auguste back to the fort at that point, it might possibly have altered the events that followed. For the first time Lt. Grattan saw the size of the village into which he had led his men. The village was made up of some 600 Sioux lodges, with a population of some 4,800 people, of which approximately 1,200 were warriors. By this point, some of the more experienced soldiers were voicing quietly that their small force was not in a good position, and leaving would be advisable.
Halfway into the village, now seeing painted warriors who were openly hostile and riding aggressively around the column, Lt. Grattan stopped, and asked the advice of James Bordeau, an experienced trader who had lived on the frontier for many years. Bordeau had been at Fort Laramie when the earlier incident happened with Conquering Bear, and was in the village trading when the army column entered. He was not aware that the army intended on arresting High Forehead. Bordeau would later state that Auguste, the translator, was openly intoxicated and yelling to the Indians that the army had come to kill them all. Lt. Grattan spoke with Bordeau and asked how this matter could more easily be solved without bloodshed, to which Bordeau responded that Grattan should speak again with Conquering Bear, and let him handle the matter in his own time.
At this point Auguste was calling the Sioux warriors women, and was riding wildly around on his horse saying they had come to fight, not to talk. Lt. Grattan led his force deeper into the village, and located High Forehead, who upon being ordered to surrender High Forehead dared Lt. Grattan to come fight him man to man, and that he would die rather than surrender. This annoyed Grattan greatly, who now turned to negotiating with Conquering Bear. The Indian leader requested that Lt. Grattan have soldiers go and retrieve James Bordeau to translate, as Auguste would not translate correctly, and, he was intoxicated. One of the Indian leaders, Man-Afraid-Of-His-Horse, went and retrieved Bordeau. However, before Bordeau arrived the tension between Lt. Grattan and Conquering Bear had increased. Bordeau quickly realized before he reached the meeting spot that violence was obviously not going to be avoided, and he turned back.
At some point, Lt. Grattan ordered his two artillery pieces turned to point at the village. Immediately hundreds of warriors surrounded the soldiers. An up-and-coming young warrior at the time, Red Cloud led a group of warriors around to flank the soldiers. Bordeau again decided to go and see what he could do to halt any violence. However, when he reached about twenty five yards distance from the meeting spot, he observed the flanking movements of the Indians, and could hear the heated exchange between Lt. Grattan and Conquering Bear, he again retreated. Bordeau returned to his trading post, where he told all traders inside to load their weapons, as a fight was coming.
Lt. Grattan concluded his meeting, and was apparently intending on departing, as Conquering Bear turned and walked toward his lodge. However, before Lt. Grattan reached his detachment, a nervous soldier fired into some approaching warriors, wounding one man. Grattan initially moved to his artillery, however his gun crews were the first to fall, being hit by a volley of arrows. Lt. Grattan died near to the artillery. His force, now down to 18 men, banded together and attempted to reach a rocky area where they could make a stand. However, they had to cross an open prairie before reaching that point, and encountered Red Cloud's warriors in between. The remainder of Grattan's force was quickly overwhelmed and annihilated.

Devil's Hole (North Sea)

Devil's Hole is a group of deep trenches in the North Sea about 200 km (125 mi) east of Dundee, Scotland. 
The features, which were first charted by "HMS Fitzroy", were officially recorded in the Royal Geographical Society's "Geographical Journal" in 1931. Soundings showed that the surrounding seabed is between 80 and 90 metres (260 - 300 ft) but the trenches are as deep as 230 m (750 ft). They run in a north-south direction and are on average between 1 and 2 km (.6 - 1.25 mi) in width and 20 to 30 km (12 - 18 mi) long. 
Historically, fishermen have known about the Devil's Hole for generations because they have lost trawl nets on the trenches' steep sides. It is for this reason that the area took its name. 
The trench sides in the Devil's Hole are steep - up to 10° in places. In a comparison, the Continental Slope northwest of Great Britain only has an average gradient of 1°.

Corsican citron

The Corsican citron is a sweet pulp citron, which was traditionally one of the most important varieties employed in Succade production. The name is from its most original cultivation center which is even today, at the French Island of Corsica or Corse. The fruit used to be shipped to Italy, where it was depulped in the large centers in Livorno, hence its name the "Citron of Commerce".
For a short period of time Genoese merchants, who supplied fruit for the Jewish ritual of Etrog, used to ship also some amount of this Corsican variety. This tradition stopped due to competition with the Greek citron which was considered to be of extraordinary beauty.
Today the citron is cooked with sugar to produce a jam.

Hotel Café

The Hotel Café is a live music venue located off an alley on the Cahuenga Boulevard strip in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California that has become known for helping to establish the careers of new singer-songwriters in the 2000s. The venue began as a coffee shop, but has gained a reputation as an intimate performance space featuring acoustic-based female songwriters, such as Anna Nalick, Sara Bareilles, Ingrid Michaelson, Priscilla Ahn, Charlotte Martin, Laura Jansen and Meiko. The venue has become its own brand, with its Hotel Café Tour, a record label, and two albums, "Live From the Hotel Café", and "The Hotel Café Presents...Winter Songs", that are downloadable via the iTunes Store.
History.
When The Hotel Café opened in 2000, it operated as a coffee shop where singer-songwriters came to perform their material for small audiences. Co-owner Maximillian Mamikunian has noted that in the venue's early days, turning a profit was challenging, as the cafe's steamers and blenders could only be run between songs so as not to drown them out. Today, the venue's main room still has its five original elevated bar tables running along a hallway linking the front and back of the club, as well as six dinner tables set immediately in front of the stage. In 2004, the club acquired space next door and underwent expansion for eight months.
Significant Activity.
Since 2004, the club has curated an annual group musical tour. Past featured artists have include Meiko, Rachael Yamagata, and Brooke Fraser. Most stops are in the United States, but past tours have also included performances in Norway and Switzerland. 
In October 2008, The Hotel Cafe concluded talks with iTunes that paved the way for official "Live from The Hotel Café" downloads that debuted the following month. Also in October of the same year, an album of four Hotel Café regulars was featured and offered for sale at over 2,100 Starbucks locations. The club's eponymous record label has seen success with "The Hotel Café Presents...Winter Songs" and "Live From the Hotel Café Volume 1." Other artists, including Matt Hires, have recorded live albums at the club under other record labels. John Mayer has also played surprise shows at the cafe and has tried out new songs from his past two albums before their release. 
The Hotel Café's website, like the venue itself, has served as a source for new artists to be tapped by music enthusiasts and industry professionals alike. Grey's Anatomy music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas has used both the website and club itself as sources for discovering artists and songs she uses on the show. Meiko, an artist who hit the No. 1 folk spot on iTunes in August 2008, was discovered by Patsavas via The Hotel Café, as was the English singer-songwriter Adele. Another artist favored by Patsavas for use on Grey's Anatomy, Greg Laswell, has praised the club for its "rare" environment and has become one of its regulars.

<doc id="20043748" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20043748" title="Pennies (drinking game)">
Pennies (drinking game)

Pennies is a formal team-based drinking game where players attempt to score points by successfully throwing a penny into opponents' glasses. While many variations of the rules have been practiced, they all center around two teams of two players each where the players sit on the floor with their feet together and the teams facing each other. Each player positions a glass goblet containing some liquid between his or her legs. In this position, players follow a rotation of turns at shooting the game penny, and attempt to land the penny in an opponent's glass.
Basic Rules.
1. A shot into the glass of the player directly across from the shooter scores 1 point. A shot into the glass of the diagonally-oriented opponent scores 2 points. The first team to score 21 points wins.
2. If both teams achieve 10 points at the same time, the score resets to 0-0.
3. If both teams achieve 20 points at the same time, the score resets to 10-10 (note - at this point the score does NOT go back to 0-0. This is the only time the score can actually be 10-10)
4. If a team scores a 2-point shot when they have 20 points, that team's score returns to 0. This is sometimes done on purpose to attempt to "round" the opponent for a more rousing victory and bragging rights.
5. Players take turns in shooting and the rotation alternates between teams. Thus if there are teams 1 and 2 and each team has players A and B, then the order of shooters would be 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, 1A, etc. If any player shoots when it is not his or her turn, that player must take a drink, and any points scored for that shot do not count. Also, if it was his or her teammate's turn when the out-of-turn shot was taken, then the teammate's turn is passed over.
6. Players must not move their glass while they are being shot at. Penalty for doing so is a drink for the offending player. Also if the shot is missed while the targeted glass is moved, the shooter gets to re-shoot.
7. No player but the shooter may touch the penny with his or her hand when it is shot until the penny comes to a rest or it hits the floor, whichever occurs first. "Hand" for the purposes of this rule is defined to extend from the fingertips to the elbow.
8. Players may "call" their shot. This is a form of drink-betting on the shot to take place. This betting may only be initiated by the player who is about to shoot, and it traditionally done by calling out the score they will achieve when the shot is made. The outcome of the shot determines who must drink. In the event the shot is made, both players on the scored-upon team must drink. If the shot is missed, only the player who called his shot must drink, not his teammate.
9. If at any time the game penny lands in a player's side glass (their beverage container), that player must drink the entire glass or container.
10. At any time a player may ask an opponent what the current score is. When a call is made for the current score, nobody may say the score but the person who has been asked. Failure to recite the score correctly results in a drink for the player making the error.
11. Spilling liquid either from the player's goblet or from the side cup is a party foul and requires an extra drink.
There are many variations on specific rules, there are 2 common game types, and most variations form some kind of hybrid of these two: Old Man, and Gentleman's.
Old Man Rules.
Old Man rules are considered to be most "pure" form of pennies as it was originally created. They are also the most challenging for the players and typically result in more alcohol consumption. Traditionally, Old Man rules are put in place when all players are experienced and skilled. Official matches for bragging rights and/or titles are generally played with Old Man rules.
1. Drinks are poured directly into the players' goblets. When a point is scored, both players on the team that was scored upon must drink the entire contents of their goblet.
2. When a violation occurs that requires extra drinking, this is done by pouring extra booze into the player's goblet. That is, for a hand violation or a missed shot, the player must double the liquid in his goblet (though drinking is not required until a score is made on his team). If the opposing team calls a shot and successfully scores a point, the scored-upon players need not necessarily double their liquid, but must pour at least a drink's worth of extra liquid into their goblets before they drink.
3. If a shot penny touches the liquid in the targeted cup but does not come to rest inside the glass, then the player whose liquid was touched must double the liquid. The shot does not score a point and play continues as a missed shot.
4. If a shot penny bounces back in the direction of the shooting team, it is eligible for "rebound." Any player can grab the penny after it comes in contact with the floor. If the team that shot the penny retrieves it, the original shooter gets another shot. If the shot-at team retrieves the penny, play continues as a missed shot with the next shooter in rotation taking his shot.
5. If an incorrect score call is made, the team who asked for the score call may "accept" the incorrect score. Acceptance is declared either by saying nothing and shooting the penny or by speaking an affirmative such as "yes." When an incorrect score call is accepted, the official score changes to become the newly accepted score. Alternatively to accepting the incorrect call, the asking team may indicate the called score is wrong and the player who failed to recite the score correctly must double the liquid in his or her glass.
Gentleman's Rules.
Gentleman's rules are considered most suitable for "friendly" matches. They are traditionally used when women are playing, when one or more of the players is inexperienced, or when players simply wish to play a more relaxed version of the game.
1. Water is held in the players' goblets. Players drink from side cups rather than from their goblets.
2. When violations occur requiring extra drinks, drinks are taken immediately from the side cups.
3. If a penny touches the water in the targeted cup but does not come to rest in the glass, then the player who shot the penny gets another shot and the player whose water was touched takes a drink.

The Red One

"The Red One" is a short story by Jack London. It was first published in the October 1918 issue of "The Cosmopolitan", two years after London's death. The story was reprinted in the same year by MacMillan, in a collection of London's stories of the same name.
The story is told from the perspective of a scientist called Bassett, who is on an expedition in the jungle of Guadalcanal to collect butterflies.
The "Red One" of the title refers to a giant red sphere, of apparently extraterrestrial origin, that the headhunting natives worship as their god and to which they perform human sacrifices. Bassett becomes obsessed with the Red One and in the end is sacrificed himself.
The story's theme was suggested to London by his friend George Sterling: a message is sent from an alien civilization but is lost in the wilderness. 
Critics have noted the possible influence of Carl Jung on the story, as London became aware of Jung's ideas at around the time of writing "The Red One" in 1916.
The story makes an enigmatic reference to helmeted figures, perhaps the Red One's alien crew. Here, London may have anticipated the ancient astronauts of science fiction and pseudoscience. 
The U.S. copyright on "The Red One" has expired, and the story is available on Project Gutenberg.

Pigato is a white Italian wine grape planted primarily in Liguria. As a varietal, it's a grape found in the Riviera di Ponente zone in Italy's region of Liguria which makes study, highly aromatic wines with plenty of fruit.
All sorts of theories exist about its origins: it could be Greek, or brought by the Romans from central Italy, or be related to Arneis or Vermentino; it is often confused with the latter.
It gains its name, which means "spotted" from the appearance of the ripe grapes.

Crewe built 170 engines between 1906 and 1909. The LNWR reused numbers from withdrawn locomotives, so the numbering was haphazard. All passed onto LMS ownership in 1923. The LMS gave them the power classification 4F. The LMS renumbered them into the more logical series 8700-869. Withdrawals started in 1931.

Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad

The Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad was a narrow gauge railroad in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Originally built in 1871, it may have been the first American common carrier narrow gauge railroad. It purchased a rail line called the Coal Hill Coal Railroad from the Pittsburgh Coal Company, and used a coal mine under Mt. Washington as a tunnel to transport coal from Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh. Passenger traffic was added soon afterwards, and the train carried passengers during the day and coal at night. The original plan was to extend the line to Finleyville, Pennsylvania, but the original narrow gauge line ran only as far as Castle Shannon. The right of way continued as the Pittsburgh, Castle Shannon and Washington Railroad, later to become part of the Pittsburgh Southern Railroad.
In spite of its location above the rivers in Pittsburgh, it sustained flood damage on at least one occasion. The Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Tunnel was closed to passenger traffic in 1880, but coal trains continued to use it until 1912. Passengers continued to travel over Mt. Washington via two inclines, the Castle Shannon Incline and a "back" incline. The right of way, excluding the tunnel through the coal mine, was leased by Pittsburgh Railways in 1905, and later purchased in 1950. The railroad ran with a dual gauge system, with coal trains continuing to run on the narrow gauge, and at night, and trolleys on a wider gauge (?). The right of way is part of the Pittsburgh Light Rail transportation system today, from South Hills Junction to Library, Pennsylvania.

Vishahareswara Temple

The Vishahareswara Temple is a temple to Shiva in the Thiruvarur district of Tamil Nadu. The temple was built in the early 19th century in the village of Kodandaramapuram, which later became part of Avanam Paruthiyur, situated on the banks of the Kudamurutti River, a tributary of the Kaveri. The temple faces south. The presiding deity of this temple is a form of Shiva called Vishahareswarar, and his consort Prasanna Parvathy Devi.
Mythology.
Once Rahu approached with his mouth agape to eclipse the Sun, he became very angry when he saw the burning rays of the Sun. He began to emit poisonous breath in his serpent form, blackening the face of the Sun.
Having lost his glorious face by Rahu’s poisonous breath, the Sun sought the favor of Lord Shiva and worshiped him on the northern banks of the Kudamurutti River, a tributary of the Kaveri, under a Bilwa Tree. First Goddess Parvathy Devi blessed Sun, and then Lord Shiva himself joined her and the divine couple blessed him. Lord Shiva relieved the Sun of the evil effects of Rahus’s poison and the Sun regained His charm and brightness. Rahu then felt remorse for his actions and begged Lord Shiva’s pardon.
The Shiva temple that was built here to commemorate Shiva blessing the Surya. The temple hosts Shiva as Vishahareswarar, which means "poison remover", along with his consort Prasanna Parvathi Devi. Paruthiyur Vishahareshwarar temple is famous and very auspicious.
Festivals.
The temple is open to the public mornings and evenings. Shivarathri is celebrated in a special way in this temple. Also, it is said that the poison of a snake will be ineffective at this place. Though there are many snakes and cobras in every nook and corner of the village, there has never been a snakebite or poison attack. It is also believed that worshiping Shiva & Parvathy here gets one relieved of the evil effects of Rahu, Kethu and Mars, and also finalizes marriages. Parithi means the Sun. Since it was here where the Sun worshiped Lord Shiva, this holy place got the name Parithipuram. People with poisonous bites and deadly diseases come from distant places and to pray to Vishahareswarar, the poison remover.
History.
This Vishahareswara temple was built by a great Shiva Bhakta by the name Paruthiyur Venkatesha Sastri, popularly known as Annaval, who lived during the rule of Serfoji II Maharaja. Annaval had spent most of his time in this temple with his parayanams of the Shiva Purana, teaching the scriptures, spreading bhakti and promoting Hindu Dharma. He was an authority on Saivite traditions. Annaval addressed several issues by answering the queries on Dharma Sastram and Hindu traditions, often posed to him by Vedic scholars and pundits. His authority on the administration of dharma made many legal luminaries come to them seeking their advice on issues concerning Hindu law. Paruthiyur Venkatesha Sastri Annaval (1770–1841), along with his brother Paruthiyur Sri Krishna Sastri Ayyaval (1773–1860), were the doyen brothers of Paruthiyur and for the Hindu Religion.
The great exponent of the Ramayana, Philanthropist and Pravachan Pioneer Bramasri Paruthiyur Krishna Sastrigal (1855–1911), renovated this Vishahareswarar Temple and did Kumbhabhishekam in 1905.

Terret gris

Terret gris is a white French wine grape variety planted primarily in the Languedoc wine region. It is a mutation of the ancient "Vitis vinifera" vine Terret. "Appellation d'origine contrôlée" (AOC) regulations allow the grape to used in white wines from the Corbières, Coteaux du Languedoc and Minervois AOCs as well as some "vin de pays". The vine has a very long history in the region and is capable of producing full bodied wines with crisp acidity. 
Terret blanc is the white mutation of the grape. In official statistics, the plantings of two "light-berried" Terret grapes (as distinguished from Terret noir, one of the permitted blending grapes for Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC) are often counted together. The varieties reached their peak in French wine productions in the late 1980s when together the Terret varieties were the ninth most widely planted white grape variety. In the Languedoc, plantings of Terret were equal to that of Chardonnay.
Wine regions.
Terret gris is most widely planted in the Languedoc region. In the late 1980s, when the variety was at its peak usage, there were over 12,300 acres (5,000 hectares) planted in the region (some plantings were likely Terret blanc which is often counted together in official statistics). The grape is a permitted variety in the white AOC wines of Corbières, Coteaux du Languedoc and Minervois, though its use in the Coteaux du Languedoc was rapidly declining at the end of the 20th century.
As of 2000, the "Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité" (INAO) reported that there was 3000 hectares of the light skinned Terrets, of which approximately 2,600 ha (6,400 acres) were believed to be the Terret blanc variety in particular.
Wine styles.
Terret gris produces a full bodied wine with noticeably acidity. In favorable vintages, the aromas can have a distinctive mineral note.
Synonyms.
Over the years, Terret gris and its wines have been known under various synonyms including Bourret, Tarret, Terrain, Terret bourret and Terret rose.

Paul Baynes

Paul Baynes (Bayne, Baines) (c.1573–1617) was an English clergyman. Described as a “radical Puritan”, he was unpublished in his lifetime, but more than a dozen works were put out in the five years after he died. His commentary on "Ephesians" is his best known work; the commentary on the first chapter, itself of 400 pages, appeared in 1618. 
Life.
He went to school at Wethersfield, Essex. A pupil and follower of William Perkins, he graduated B.A. in 1593/4, M.A. in 1597, and was elected a Fellow of Christ's College Cambridge in 1600, a position he lost in 1608 for non-conformity. He was successor to Perkins as lecturer at the church of St Andrew the Great in Cambridge, opposite Christ's; they were considered the town's leading Puritan preachers.
Influence.
Baynes was an important influence on the following generation of English Calvinists, through William Ames, a convert of Perkins, and Richard Sibbes, a convert of Baynes himself. This makes Baynes a major link in a chain of "Puritan worthies": to John Cotton, John Preston, Thomas Shepard and Thomas Goodwin. Ames quoted Baynes: "Beware of a strong head and a cold heart", an idea that would be repeated by Cotton Mather, who was grandson to John Cotton.

2012 Pacific typhoon season

The 2012 Pacific typhoon season was a fairly average and destructive season, but rather active since 2004. The season became very active between mid-July and mid-August, with nine named storms formed during the period.
Vicente underwent explosive intensification and made landfall over the west Pearl River Delta as a strong typhoon. Damrey developed into a typhoon in the Yellow Sea and became the most intense tropical cyclone to make landfall north of the Yangtze River since 1949. Typhoon Haikui, although centred far away from the Philippines, killed at least 89 people in the country. Typhoon Tembin affected Taiwan twice because of its cyclonic loop.
From late August to September, three very powerful typhoons, Bolaven, Sanba and Jelawat, directly hit Okinawa Island successively. In October, the remnants of Severe Tropical Storm Gaemi arrived at the Bay of Bengal and re-intensified into a deep depression before making landfall over Bangladesh. In December, Typhoon Bopha, an unusually very low-latitude but very powerful tropical cyclone, caused catastrophic damage in Mindanao in the Philippines. Bopha killed at least 1,146 people and cost $1.04 billion (2012 USD) in the Philippines, becoming the deadliest storm worldwide in 2012 and the costliest Philippine typhoon in history.
Seasonal forecasts.
During each season, several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and the Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. During previous seasons the Guy Carpenter Asia-Pacific Climate Impact Centre also issued forecasts, however they did not issue a forecast this year as it had been overestimating how many tropical cyclones would develop during the last few seasons.
On March 20, the Hong Kong Observatory predicted that the typhoon season in Hong Kong, would start in June or slightly earlier, with 5–8 tropical cyclones passing within of the territory. The TSR Consortium subsequently released their initial forecast of the season on April 11, and predicted that the basin would see activity about 10% below the 1965-2011 average, with 25.5 tropical storms, 15.6 typhoons, 7.3 "intense" typhoons and an ACE index of about 262 units. In late April, the China Meteorological Administration's Shanghai Typhoon Institute (CMA-STI) predicted that between 22 and 25 tropical storms would develop within the basin during the year. On May 5, after a new forecast model had become available, TSR predicted that the season would now be near-normal as a new forecast model had become available as a result they raised their forecast for the number of intense typhoons to 8.5 and the ACE Index to 300 units. On May 21, the Thai Meteorological Department predicted that 1-2 tropical storms would affect Thailand during 2012. They predicted that 1 would move through Vietnam and affect Upper Thailand, during August or September, while the other one was expected to move through Southern Thailand during October or November.
In late June after six typhoons had formed Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau predicted that the season, would be near or below its average of 25.7 with 23 – 26 tropical storms occurring over the basin during 2012. Between three and five of the systems were predicted to affect Taiwan compared to an average of around 3.6. Within its July forecast update TSR increased its forecast and now predicted that the basin would see activity about 10% above the 1965-2011 average with 26.8 tropical storms, 16.7 typhoons, 9.2 "intense" typhoons and an ACE index of about 324 units. This increase was attributed to the sea surface temperatures being expected to be warmer than previously thought. Within its July — December seasonal climate outlook, PAGASA predicted that 7 — 10 tropical cyclones were likely to develop within or enter the Philippine area of responsibility between July and September, while 4 — 7 were predicted to occur between October and December. On August 6, TSR tweaked its forecast but still expected activity to be 10% above the 1965-2011 average with 27.4 tropical storms, 17.4 typhoons, 9.3 "intense" typhoons and an ACE index of about 327 units.
Storms.
Tropical Depression 01W.
Early on February 17, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed, about to the southeast of Manila on the Philippine island of Luzon. During that day the depression moved westwards, before the Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories at 1500 UTC and designated the system as Tropical Depression 01W. However, six hours later the JTWC issued its final advisory as vertical windshear had started to increase, and after it had found no deep convection near the systems low level circulation centre during a reassessment of the depressions low level structure. Over the next few days the JMA continued to monitor the depression before it was last noted during February 20. Heavy rains associated with the outer bands of the system triggered widespread flooding and several landslides in the western Philippines. At least two people were killed and another was listed as missing. Three homes were destroyed and five others were damaged as a result of the storm. Overall, nearly 30,000 people were affected by the storm and losses exceeded ₱40 million (US$1 million).
Tropical Storm Pakhar.
On March 28, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the tropical depression, as its LLCC began to consolidate more. Early on March 29, the JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm, and named it "Pakhar", because the storm's convection had completely wrapped around the circulation center. Early on March 30, the JTWC upgraded Pakhar to a Category 1 typhoon, as a banding eye formed. Because of land interaction and colder sea surface temperatures, the JTWC downgraded Pakhar to a tropical storm, early on March 31. On April 1, Pakhar made landfall near Vung Tau, Vietnam, and began to weaken. Early on April 2, the JMA reported that Pakhar had weakened into a tropical depression, before they reported later that day that the system had dissipated over Cambodia.
Although Pakhar did not affect the Philippines as a tropical cyclone, its precursor produced heavy rains across part of the nation. Flooding occurred in different parts of central and southern Luzon, and the northern Visayas region. In Basud, Camarines Norte, 128 families had to be evacuated due to flash flooding. A few landslides resulted from the rains, damaging or destroying a few homes. Throughout the affected region, five people were killed and three others were listed as missing. In Vietnam, four people were killed and several others were injured due to flash flooding and high winds. The hardest hit area was Khanh Hoa province where the storm made landfall. About 4,400 homes were damaged in the region by the storm and thousands of acres of rice paddy were flooded. In Ho Chi Minh City, officials reported that 600 homes and schools were destroyed. The remnants of the system brought rains to parts of Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.
Severe Tropical Storm Sanvu.
On May 20, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed about to the southeast of Guam.
Sanvu brought tropical storm force wind gusts and between of rainfall to parts of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. However the only damage reported was on Guam where falling tree limbs caused an estimated of damage to power lines.
Typhoon Mawar (Ambo).
Mawar brought torrential rain to parts of the Philippines including the Bicol Region while enhancing the southwest monsoon which triggered delays and cancelled of air flights. In Bicol region, more than 332 passengers were stranded at ports due to Mawar. Different domestic and international flights were forced to divert at Clark Air Base rather than NAIA due to bad weather. Some other flights were also cancelled. At least three were reported dead due to rains brought by Mawar.
Typhoon Guchol (Butchoy).
Between June 14 and 18, Guchol enhanced the southwestern monsoon over the Philippines, resulting in widespread rains. However, the effects of these rains were limited and only one fatality took place. In Japan, airlines cancelled 420 domestic and international flights because of the strong winds, affecting 32,600 passengers. The town of Nachikatsuura, some 400 kilometres southwest of Tokyo, ordered nearly 1,600 residents to evacuate, warning of the danger of landslides brought on by heavy rain, media reports said.At least two people were killed and eighty others were injured across the country. Total economic losses were estimated in excess of ¥8 billion (US$100 million).
Tropical Storm Doksuri (Dindo).
On June 25, the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed, within the monsoon trough about to the southeast of Manila, Philippines. During that day the depression moved north-westwards and consolidated further before during the next day, PAGASA started to monitor it as Tropical Depression Dindo. Later that day, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Doksuri, and the JTWC upgraded Doksuri to a tropical depression. Late on the same day, the JTWC upgraded Doksuri to a tropical storm. On June 27, Doksuri’s low-level circulation center became exposed due to moderate easterly wind shear. On June 28, the JTWC downgraded Doksuri to a tropical depression, as the system’s exposed circulation center began to undergo an unusual circulation center replacement cycle, which involves a circulation center to be replaced by another new circulation center. Late on June 29, Doksuri made landfall over Zhuhai, Guangdong, China. During June 30, the JMA reported that Doksuri had weakened into a tropical depression, before reporting that the depression had dissipated later that day. In Macau, the storm caused minor roof damage.
Severe Tropical Storm Khanun (Enteng).
On July 29 the North Korean government dramatically raised the death toll in the country to 88, with an additional 134 injured. The biggest loss of human life was in two counties of South Pyongan Province. At least 63,000 were made homeless by the flooding, while more than 30,000 hectares of land for growing crops were submerged and will add to growing fears of another looming famine in the country. Three hundred public buildings and 60 factories were damaged during the storm.
Typhoon Vicente (Ferdie).
Originally Khanun’s large area of convention on July 16, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression on July 18. On July 20, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system; soon, the PAGASA upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it "Ferdie". The JTWC also upgraded the system to a tropical depression late on the same day. After the system moved into the South China Sea on July 21, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it "Vicente", so did the JTWC.
On July 23, due to weak vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperature, Vicente started to undergo an explosive intensification prompting the JMA to upgrade Vicente to a typhoon, and the JTWC upgraded Vicente to a category 4 typhoon later. At 16:45 UTC, the HKO issued the Hurricane Signal, No. 10, the first since Typhoon York in 1999. Later, Typhoon Vicente made landfall over Taishan in Guangdong, China. Due to land interaction, the JMA downgraded Vicente to a severe tropical storm early on July 24, and the JTWC downgraded Vicente to a category 3 typhoon. Late on the same day, the JMA downgraded Vicente to a tropical depression.
Typhoon Saola (Gener).
On July 26, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of strong vertical windshear in the monsoon trough about to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines.
Early on July 28, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, whilst the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it "Saola". Soon, the PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression and named it "Gener". Later that day, the JTWC upgraded Saola to a tropical storm. Early on July 29, the JMA upgraded Saola to a severe tropical storm. On July 30, the JTWC upgraded Saola to a category 1 typhoon, as it started to develop an eye-like feature, but soon downgraded it to a tropical storm late on the same day. Late on July 31, the JMA upgraded Saola to a typhoon. It continued to intensify the next day, reaching its peak intensity as a Category 2 typhoon.
Most forecast models predicts Saola to pass very near on the northern coastline of Taiwan, but this is defied on August 1, when Saola had made landfall on Taiwan as a Category 2 typhoon. It moved slowly inland, making a counter-clockwise loop. It made out to sea, now downgraded as a severe tropical storm. Just then did Saola passed very close to the northern coastline of Taiwan, then it headed straight for China. On August 3 it made landfall near Fuding, Fujian Province as a tropical storm, then headed straight inland until on the next day when Saola dissipated near Jiangxi.
Typhoon Damrey.
Originally a cold-core low, the system became a tropical disturbance southwest of Minamitorishima late on July 26. Early on July 27, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded it to a tropical depression. On July 28, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system, before the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it "Damrey". Late on the same day, the JTWC upgraded Damrey to a tropical depression, and even upgraded it to a tropical storm on the next day. After Damrey had drifted slowly for two days, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm northeast of Chichi-jima late on July 30, when the storm began to accelerate moving west-northwest and form a banding eye. On August 1, the JTWC upgraded Damrey to a category 1 typhoon, while the system passed through the Ōsumi Islands in Japan, as it started to develop an well defined eye. When Damrey drifted towards Yellow Sea on August 2, the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon. Soon, Typhoon Damrey made landfall over Xiangshui County in Jiangsu, China at 13:30 UTC (21:30 CST). The system then dissipated near Hebei on August 4.
Typhoon Haikui.
Late on July 31, a tropical disturbance formed within a large monsoon trough. On August 1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) mentioned the system as a tropical depression southeast of Iwo Jima, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert late on the same day. Late on August 2, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression, before the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it "Haikui" early on the next day. Early on August 4, the JTWC upgraded Haikui to a tropical storm. On August 5, the JMA upgraded Haikui to a severe tropical storm when it was located north-northeast of Kume Island. Later, Typhoon Haikui made landfall over Xiangshan County in Zhejiang, China at 19:20 UTC (03:20 CST on August 8). 
Severe Tropical Storm Kirogi.
During August 3, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed, about to the northwest of Wake Island. Over the next day the system gradually developed further, before the JTWC started to monitor the system as Tropical Depression 13W, late on August 4.
On August 5, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm. Early on August 6, the JMA reported that the system had become extratropical. However, the JMA designated it as a tropical storm with the name "Kirogi" early on August 8. Early on August 9, the JTWC downgraded Kirogi to a tropical depression. Later, the JMA upgraded Kirogi to a severe tropical storm,it reached its peak intensity, while the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm again. Later that day, the JTWC issued its final warning on Kirogi as it transitioned from a warm cored tropical system to a cold cored subtropical system. The remnants of the system then entered the Sea of Okhotsk.
Typhoon Kai-tak (Helen).
The monsoonal trough spawned a tropical disturbance early on August 10, which had organizing convection and a weak circulation. Early on August 12, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system as a weak Tropical Depression with winds under 30 knots. Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started issuing advisories on the system, naming it "Helen". That day, the JTWC also initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 14W. Early on August 13, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Kai-tak. and 9 hours later the JTWC followed suit. Later the same day, the JMA upgraded it to a Severe Tropical Storm. On August 15, the convection increased as outflow improved, and the JTWC upgraded Kai-tak to a typhoon. The storm continued towards China, with deepening convection due to decreasing wind shear. However, it was only at 0000 UTC on August 16 when the JMA officially declared Kai-tak a typhoon. At the same time, the PAGASA issued their last warning on Kai-tak, otherwise known as Helen, locally, as it left the Philippine area of Responsibility.
On the morning of August 17, Kai-tak made landfall over the Leizhou peninsula in southern China as a typhoon. Within 6 hours, Kai-tak made a second landfall over the northeast coast of Vietnam and weakened slightly to a tropical storm. Later that night, the JTWC issued their final warning on the system as it weakened further and sped up inland. The JMA stopped tracking the storm early the next morning, no longer considering it a tropical cyclone.
Typhoon Tembin (Igme).
On August 16, a tropical disturbance formed southeast of Taiwan. On August 17, the JMA mentioned it as a tropical depression, as a subtropical ridge pushed the system southwards. The JTWC issued a TCFA on the system late on August 18; early on the next day, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it "Tembin", and the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression. Soon, the PAGASA also upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it "Igme". On August 20, Tembin entered a period of explosive intensification by excellent dual outflow, prompting both the JMA and the JTWC upgrading it to a typhoon.
On August 22, Tembin began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle, as it further weakened to a category 1 typhoon. On August 23, Tembin re-intensified into a category 3 typhoon, before it made landfall over Pingtung, Taiwan later on the same day. Due to minor land interaction, the JMA downgraded Tembin to a severe tropical storm early on August 24, and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm later. 
Typhoon Bolaven (Julian).
Forming as a tropical depression on August 19 to the southwest of the Mariana Islands, Bolaven steadily intensified as it slowly moved west-northwestward in a region favoring tropical development. The system was soon upgraded to a tropical storm less than a day after formation and further to a typhoon by August 21. Strengthening became more gradual thereafter as Bolaven grew in size. On August 24, the system attained its peak intensity with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a barometric pressure of 910 mbar (hPa; 26.87 inHg). Weakening only slightly, the storm passed directly over Okinawa on August 26 as it began accelerating toward the north. Steady weakening continued as Bolaven approached the Korean Peninsula and it eventually made landfall in North Korea late on August 28 before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants rapidly tracked northeastward and was last noted over the Russian Far East.
Although Bolaven struck the Ryukyu Islands as a powerful typhoon, damage was less than expected. Relatively few buildings were damaged or destroyed across the region. The most significant effects stemmed from heavy rains, amounting to , that caused flash flooding and landslides. One person drowned on Amami Ōshima after being swept away by a swollen river. In mainland Japan, two people drowned after being swept away by rough seas. In South Korea, 19 people were killed by the storm. Many buildings were damaged and approximately 1.9 million homes were left without power. Losses in the country reached ₩420 billion (US$374.3 million), the majority of which was due to destroyed apple orchards. Significant damage also took place in North Korea where at least 59 people were killed and 50 others were reported missing. Additionally, 6,700 homes were destroyed. Offshore, nine people drowned after two Chinese vessels sank.
Typhoon Sanba (Karen).
A low-pressure area formed east of Palau on September 9. On September 10, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression. As the system entered the PAR early on September 11, the PAGASA named it "Karen". At the same time, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it "Sanba", and the JTWC also upgraded it to a tropical storm later. 
In Kōchi Prefecture, Japan, 222 hectares (548 acres) of agricultural land was damaged by the storm, with losses reaching ¥50 million (US$640,000). Throughout Okinawa, damage to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries amounted to ¥900 million (US$11.5 million).
Severe Tropical Storm Ewiniar.
Early on September 22, a tropical disturbance formed west of Guam, out of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression on the next day. On September 24, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, as it became better organized, however the low level circulation center remained exposed, due to outflow wind shear from Jelawat, which pushed the convection to the east of the system, and prevented it from strengthening more quickly. On September 24, the JTWC further upgraded the system to a minimal tropical storm and named it "Ewiniar", as the system started moving away from Jelawat, which allowed it to strengthen.On September 27, with the system far from Jelawat's outflow, the exposed low level circulation center was wrapped with convection, and the JMA upgraded the system to a Severe tropical Storm. A small eye-like feature showed up in the satellite image of Ewiniar. On September 29, the system became totally exposed, with the convection being blown away by strong vertical wind shear. It became extratropical the next day.
Severe Tropical Storm Maliksi.
On September 27, a large tropical disturbance formed near Chuuk. On September 29, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression. On October 1, the system was upgraded into a tropical storm and named "Maliksi". The large storm developed a mid-level circulation center, with microwave satellite imagery showing that the storm had become less organized during the morning hours of October 2 because it had become slightly elongated and on October 3, the JMA upgraded it to Severe Tropical Storm, and the storm's center soon passed over Iwo To. High wind shear and unfavorable conditions made it weaken as it started transitioning to an extratropical system. On October 4, it became fully extratropical, with wind shear from the southwest, which pushed most of the showers and thunderstorms northeast of the center of circulation.
Severe Tropical Storm Gaemi (Marce).
On September 29, the JMA reported that a tropical depression that had developed within the monsoon trough, about to the northwest of Ho Chi Minh City in Southern Vietnam. As the tropical depression organized, large, powerful thunderstorms with very cold cloud top temperatures (colder than -63F/-52 C) surrounded the center of circulation, hinting that the storm was organizing and strengthening. The system remained quasi-stationary over the next 12 hours, due to weak steering environment. On October 1, the system strengthened into a tropical storm,
Typhoon Prapiroon (Nina).
On October 5, the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed about to the northeast of Hagåtña, Guam. As the JMA upgraded the storm to a Severe Tropical Storm on October 8, rapid convection produced a tightly wrapped system with multiple deep convective bands wrapping into a well-defined low level circulation center. On October 9, the JTWC, and the JMA upgraded the system to a typhoon. On October 11, as the system developed a ragged eye, the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon further, to a category 2 typhoon. The ragged eye soon became well defined as seen in Microwave imagery later that day, and was soon upgraded further to a category 3 typhoon. On October 15, as the system ws pushed south, by an anticyclone ridging in from the north, and caused it to made a small cyclonic loop. On October 16, an Anticyclone located on the north west of Prapiroon became slightly displaced to the southeast, which brought wind shear to Prapiroon's northern periphery's convection to be pushed to the south, and caused a strong southern outflow. On October 19, Prapiroon transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, as it became bombarded by strong vertical wind shear. The remnants of Prapiroon's center fully dissipated early on October 23.
Severe Tropical Storm Maria.
Late on October 12, the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed near the Northern Mariana Islands, about to the northeast of Guam.
As it moved westward it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Maria on October 14. Early the next day, the JMA upgraded the Maria into a severe tropical storm. Early on October 20, the JMA reported that Maria had dissipated.
Typhoon Son-Tinh (Ofel).
On October 19, a tropical disturbance formed southeast of Yap, and the JMA mentioned the system as a tropical depression on October 21. On October 22, the PAGASA started to monitor the tropical depression and named it "Ofel". On October 24, the storm made landfall over Leyte and capsized 6 boats in Tacloban City. The storm caused heavy rains and strong winds over the Visayas. At the night of October 24, the storm hardly hit Cebu with rain and winds. Classes in Cebu City were suspended the next day.
Authorities in the Philippines confirmed at least four deaths - an 8 year-old boy who drowned, two men crushed by falling trees, and an elderly man who died from hypothermia. Six fishermen were reported missing, and more than 13,000 passengers were stranded at ferry terminals and ports. Widespread flooding was reported as rivers burst their banks, in some instances rising as much as 12.8 meters in 24 hours. A cargo ship, called the ML Lady RP II, sank with around 1,200 sacks of copra near Zamboanga City at the height of the storm. Strong winds derailed a train in Quezon.
Son-Tinh reached typhoon strength on October 27.
Typhoon Bopha (Pablo).
On November 23, the JTWC reported that an large area of convection persisted approximately 0.6°N of the equator, or 350 nm south of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and dubbed the system as Invest 90w. Its organization steadily improved over the next few days under a favorable conditions with warm sea surface temperatures., and on November 25 both JTWC and JMA upgraded its status to a Tropical Depression, while the JTWC designated it with "26W". During the early hours of November 26, an upper-level anticyclone formed over the center with near-radial outflow and weak vertical wind shear. Under its influence, 26W strengthened gradually and acquired tropical storm status by that evening. As a result, the JMA officially named the storm "Bopha". On November 27, a deep centralized convective cover developed over the LLCC and the JTWC too upgraded Bopha into a tropical storm. By the evening of December 2, the storm entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and was named "Pablo". Late on December 3, as the system continued to strengthen, the system unexpectedly rapidly intensified into a category 5 super typhoon, as the eye started to became well defined at 27 kilometers across. Bopha made landfall as a Category 5 Super Typhoon. On December 7 Bopha rapidly intensified, going from a Category 1 to a Category 4 in less than 6 hours. The Next day it weakened rapidly from a Typhoon to a Tropical Storm due to moderate vertical wind shear. On December 9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final advisory. Later that day the remnants of Bopha dissipated completely 70 kilometers north of Binabalian, Philippines.
Tropical Storm Wukong (Quinta).
Early on December 24, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed within a trough of low pressure, about to the north-east of Palau. During that day the depressions low level circulation gradually consolidated further, as it moved towards the west-northwest along the southern edge of the subtropical ridge of high pressure. The JTWC and PAGASA subsequently initiated advisories on the system with the latter naming it Quinta. Early on December 25, the JMA reported that the depression had become a tropical storm and named it as Wukong, before reporting that the system had attained its peak 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 75 km/h (45 mph). Later that day, the system passed over or close to several of the Visayan Islands, before the JTWC reported that the system had reached its peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h (35 mph).
During December 26, Wukong continued to move through the Philippine islands, before the JTWC reported that the system had become a tropical depression, after its low level circulation center became fully exposed within an area of moderate to strong vertical windshear. However, throughout December 27, as the system moved through the South China Sea and deep convection redeveloped over the systems center, the JMA continued to report that Wukong was a tropical storm. During the next day, the JMA reported that the system had weakened into a tropical depression, before the JTWC issued their final warning on Wukong as a north-easterly cold surge along the coast of south-east Asia had caused the depression to become fully exposed. The depression subsequently was last noted during the next day by both the JTWC and the JMA, dissipating about to the south of Vietnam.
Within the Philippines, 20 people were killed, while 4 others were left missing.
Other tropical depressions.
On January 1, the JMA were issuing warnings on a weak tropical depression that was located about to the northwest of Kuala Terengganu, in Malaysia. During that day, the depression moved north-eastwards slowly, before it was last noted by the JMA later that day. On January 13, the JMA started monitoring a tropical depression that was located within an area of moderate to strong vertical windshear about to the east of Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. During that day the depression remained near stationary, before the JMA issued their final advisory on the system during the next day as the system dissipated. On April 8, the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression, that had developed about to the northeast of Tarawa island in Kiribati. Over the next few days the JMA continued to monitor the depression, before it was last noted by the JMA during April 11 about to the northwest of Wake Island. Late on April 28, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed about to the southeast of Davao City on the Philippine island of Mindanao. Over the next day, the depression moved towards the west-northwest, before it was last noted early on April 30, as it dissipated near Mindanao.
On June 26, a tropical disturbance formed southeast of Chuuk. Late on June 28, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system, but canceled it two days later. The JMA briefly upgraded the system to a tropical depression on June 30, only to downgrade it later on the same day. The system crossed the Bicol region on July 2, and later crossed the southern Luzon-Manila area, prompting school closures. On July 4, the JTWC reissued a TCFA on the system as it strengthened over the South China Sea, but once again canceled it that day due to a lack of convection, as the tropical depression degenerated into a remnant low. The storm's remnant low-pressure area caused severe flooding in Metro Manila and nearby provinces, including areas along roads. In Valenzuela, two people were killed due to a collapsing wall. The senate of the Philippines also suspended their session due to the bad weather. The Philippine National Railway stopped their operation for two hours as severe flooding in Alabang and Sucat were recorded.
On August 5, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center started to monitor a TUTT cell that had developed into a subtropical low, while located about to the southeast of Midway Atoll. Over the next few days the low moved westwards towards the Western Pacific, before it moved into the basin during August 7. As it continued to move towards the west the JMA reported on August 9, that the low had developed into a tropical depression. The system re-entered the Central Pacific Ocean early on August 11. On August 23, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed about to the northeast of Shanghai in China. Over the next few days, the depression moved northwards, before it was last noted by the JMA during August 25 moving in to North Korea. During September 10, the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression, that had developed in an area of moderate vertical windshear between two upper tropospheric trough cells about to the southeast of Tokyo, Japan. During that day the depression remained near stationary, before it started during September 11 to move northwards as it directly interacted with another area of low pressure, located about to the northwest of the depression. Over the next couple of days, as the depression moved towards the northwest, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone, before it was last noted by the JMA during September 13. Early on November 12, the JTWC reported that a tropical disturbance had developed within an area of weak to moderate vertical windshear, about to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Later that day as the system moved towards the north-northwest, the JTWC reported that the disturbance had become a tropical depression before the JMA followed suit early on November 13.
Storm names.
Within the North-western Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h, (40 mph). While the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee. Should the list of names for the Philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season. Unused names are marked in .
International names.
Tropical Cyclones are named from the following lists by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Tokyo, Japan, once they reach tropical storm strength. Names are contributed by members of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee. Each of the 14 nations or territories submitted 10 names, which are used in alphabetical order, by the English name of the country. 
Philippines.
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration uses its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones in their area of responsibility. PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility and any tropical cyclone that might move into their area of responsibility. Should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient, names are taken from an auxiliary list, the first 10 of which are published each year before the season starts. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2016 season. This is the same list used in the 2008 season, except for "Carina" and "Ferdie" which replaced "Cosme" and "Frank" respectively. Names that were not assigned/going to use are marked in .
Retirement.
During their 2013 annual session the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee, announced that the name "Bopha", would be retired from its naming lists and was replaced by the name "Ampil".
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) announced that the name "Pablo" would be stricken off from its naming lists due to its high death toll and damage. In February 2013, PAGASA selected the name "Pepito" to replace "Pablo".
Season effects.
This table lists all the storms that developed in the western Pacific Ocean to the west of the International Date Line during the 2012 season. It includes their intensity, duration, name, areas affected deaths, and damages. All damage figures are in 2012 USD. Damages and deaths from a storm include when the storm was a precursor wave, or an extratropical low.

William Whitaker (theologian)

William Whitaker (1548 – 1595) was a prominent Protestant, Reformed, Calvinistic and Anglican Churchman, professor, author and theologian. A luminary of his time. He was Master of St. John's College, Cambridge, and a leading divine in the university in the latter half of the sixteenth century. His uncle was also the famous Marian exile (from the "burning times" of 1553-1558), Alexander Nowell, noted Dean of St. Paul's and catechetist, another Protestant, Reformed, Calvinistic and Anglican divine.
Early life and education.
He was born at Holme in Cliviger near Burnley, Lancashire, in 1548, being the third son of Thomas Whitaker of that place, by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of John Nowell, esq., of Read, and sister of Alexander Nowell, dean of St Paul's." After receiving the rudiments of learning at his native parish school, he was sent by his uncle, Alexander Nowell, to St Paul's School in London. (Alexander Nowell, a Marian exile, a fugitive from the "burning times" of Anglo-Italian policies, 1553-1558, was also a Protestant, Reformed and Anglican Churchman.) Whittaker thence proceeded to Cambridge, where he matriculated as a pensioner of Trinity College on 4 Oct. 1564. He was subsequently elected a scholar on the same foundation, proceeded B.A. in March 1568, and on 6 Sept. 1569 was elected to a minor fellowship, and on 25 March 1571 to a major fellowship, at his college. In 1571 he commenced M.A. Throughout his earlier career at the university he was assisted by his uncle, who granted him leases, "freely and without fine," towards defraying his expenses. Whitaker evinced his gratitude by dedicating to Nowell a translation of the Book of Common Prayer into Greek, and a like version of Nowell's own larger catechism from the Latin into Greek.
Academic career.
The marked ability with which he acquitted
himself when presiding as "father of
the philosophy act" at an academic commencement
appears to have first brought
him prominently into notice. He also became
known as an indefatigable student of
the scriptures, the commentators, and the
schoolmen, and was very early in his career
singled out by John Whitgift, at that time master
of Trinity, for marks of special favour. On 3 Feb. 1578 he
was installed canon of Norwich Cathedral,
and in the same year was admitted to the
degree of B.D., and incorporated on 14 July
at Oxford.
In 1580 he was appointed by the
crown to the regius professorship of divinity,
to which Elizabeth shortly after added the
chancellorship of St. Paul's, London, and
from this time his position as the champion of
the teaching of the Protestant and Reformed Church of England appears
to have been definitely taken up. In 1582,
on taking part in a disputation at commencement,
he took for his thesis, "Pontifex Romanus est ille Antichristus, quern futurum Scriptura prædixit," or, "The Roman Pope is that Antichrist which the Scriptures Foretold". His lectures,
as professor, afterwards published from shorthand
notes taken by John Allenson, a fellow
of St. John's, were mainly directed towards
refuting Roman Catholic theologians, especially
Robert Bellarmine and Thomas Stapleton
He also severely criticised the
just-published Douay version of the New Testament, thereby
becoming involved in a controversy with
William Rainolds. 
His work, "Disputatio de Sacra Scriptura contra hujus temporis papistas, inprimis Robertum Bellarminum", or "Disputations on Holy Scripture", remains one of the premier volumes on the doctrine of Scripture, often under-appreciated, little read, but standing like a titan amongst the volumes of the English Reformed Churchman. One of the premier issues that divided and still divides informed Protestants from Roman Catholics is the question of the place of Scripture. Reformed Churchmmen like Whittaker, then like now, declared that the Scriptures alone are the rule of faith and practice whereas Roman Catholics assert co-equal veneration and co-authoritative roles between Scripture, traditions held by the Church and other unwritten issues. This debate is not new. William Whitaker forcefully and brilliantly championed the Protestant, Reformed and Anglican position in 1588. He deals with the number of canonical books, the authority of Scripture, the perspicuity (clarity) of Scripture, the proper interpretation of Scripture, and the perfection of Scripture against unwritten traditions.
On 28 Feb. 1586 Whitaker, on the recommendation
of Whitgift and Burghley, was
appointed by the crown to the mastership of
St. John's College. The appointment was,
however, opposed by a majority of the
fellows on the ground of his supposed leanings
towards puritanism. His rule as an
administrator justified in almost equal measure
the appointment and its objectors. The
college increased greatly in numbers and
reputation, but the puritan party gained
ground considerably in the society. Whitaker
was a no less resolute opponent of
Lutheranism than of Roman doctrine and
ritual.
In the discharge of his ordinary duties as
master his assiduity and strict impartiality
in distributing the rewards at his disposal
conciliated even those who demurred to his
theological teaching, and Baker declares
that the members of the college were "all
at last united in their affection to their
master," and that eventually "he had no
enemies to overcome."
In 1587 he was created D.D.; and in
1593, on the mastership of Trinity College
falling vacant by the preferment of Dr. John Still to the bishopric of Bath and Wells, he was an unsuccessful candidate for
the post. In the following year he published
his "De Authoritate Scripturæ",
written in reply to Stapleton, prefixing to it
a dedication to Whitgift (18 April 1594),
the latter affording a noteworthy illustration
of his personal relations with the primate,
and also of the Roman controversialist learning
of that time. In May 1595 he was installed
canon of Canterbury; but his professorship,
mastership, and canonry appear
to have left him still poor, and in a letter
to Burghley, written about a fortnight before
his death, he complains pathetically at being
so frequently passed over amid "the great
preferments of soe many." He may possibly
have been suffering from dejection at this
time, owing to the disagreement with Whitgift
in which, in common with others of the
Cambridge heads, he found himself involved
in connection with the prosecution of William Barrett. In November 1595 he
was deputed, along with Humphrey Gower, president of Queens' College, to confer
with the primate on the drawing up of
the Lambeth Articles. On this occasion he
appears to have pressed his Calvinistic views
warmly, but without success, and he returned
to Cambridge fatigued and disappointed. He fell ill and died on December 4, 1595.
As of 1900, there were two portraits of Whitaker in the master's lodge at St. John's College (one
in the drawing-room, the other in the hall), both bearing the words, "Dr. Whitaker, Mr.
1587," and one at the Chetham Hospital and Library at Manchester. His portrait was engraved by William Marshall in Thomas Fuller's "Holy State", 1642, and by John Payne. His epitaph, in Latin hexameters on a marble tablet, has been placed on the north wall of the interior of the transept of the college chapel.
His hopes of preferment were disappointed,
probably because he was
twice married, and thus forfeited in some
measure the favour of Elizabeth. The
maiden name of his first wife, who was
sister-in-law to Laurence Chaderton,
was Culverwell; his second wife, who survived
him, was the widow of Dudley Fenner.
He had eight children: one of the
sons, Alexander Whitaker, who was educated at
Trinity College, afterwards became known
as the "Apostle of Virginia." Alexander, bapitized Pocahontas. Another son who set his eyes on America was, Jabez. He was one of the first planters in Jamestowne and helped build a guest house to greet new families to Virginia.
No English divine of the sixteenth century
surpassed Whitaker in the estimation
of his contemporaries. Ralph Churton justly styles
him "the pride and ornament of Cambridge."
Bellarmine so much admired his genius and
attainments that he had his portrait suspended
in his study. Joseph Scaliger,
Bishop Hall, and Isaac Casaubon alike
speak of him in terms of almost unbounded
admiration.
Works.
The following is a list of Whitaker's published works, those included in the edition of his theological treatises reprinted by Samuel Crispin at Geneva in two volumes, folio, in 1610, being distinguished by an asterisk:
Other works by Whitaker are extant in manuscript; the Bodleian Library has
"Commentarii in Cantica", and "Prælectiones in priorem Epistolam ad Corinthios" by
him; Caius College, "Theses: de fide Davidis"; de Prædestinatione"; and St. John's
College, Cambridge, a treatise on ecclesiastical polity, which Baker thinks was
probably from his pen, although it leans somewhat to Erastianism.

Tourbat

Tourbat is a white grape variety planted primarily in the French wine region of the Côtes du Roussillon AOC where is sometimes called Malvoisie du Roussillon. It is also found in the Italian wines from Sardinia where the grape is known as Torbato and in the Aragon region of Spain. As a varietal, Tourbat is known for its smokey notes.
History.
The exact origins of Tourbat are unknown, with some ampelographers and wine historian suggesting that it has a similar origins as Grenache and is likely a Spanish variety. Its presence in Roussillon seems to trace to that area's time under the Kingdom of Majorca with James I of Aragon was lord of over a wide expanse of land that crosses the modern-day borders of southern France and northern eastern Spain. Similarly, like Grenache, Tourbat may have spread to Sardinia when the island was under the rule of the Kingdom of Aragon.
Plantings of Tourbat greatly declined in the 20th century with Sardinia remaining the one significant source of the variety for a large part of that century. Even there the grape was on the verge of extinction until one producer, Sella & Mosca, began focusing on the variety and propagating healthier cuttings. There work also lead to a slight resurgence of interest in the Roussillon region in the 1980s when the new cuttings of healthier vines were imported from Sardinia. However, overall the variety is still not widely planted.
Wine regions.
In Sardina, Tourbat is known as Torbato and is grown around Alghero in the province of Sassari on the northwestern reaches of the island. In France, it is most widely planted in the "Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée" AOC region of the Côtes du Roussillon where the variety is known as Malvoisie du Roussillon.
Wine styles.
Tourbat tends to produce full-bodied wines with distinctive aromas that often include smokey notes.
Synonyms.
Tourbat and its wines are known under a variety of synonyms including Canina, Caninu, Cuscosedda Bianca, Malvoisie des Pyrenees Orientales, Malvoisie du Roussillon, Malvoisie Tourbat, Razola, Torbat, Torbato, Torbato Bianco, Trubat Iberica, Trubau, Turbato, and Turbau.
Other Malvoisies.
Despite the similarities with the notable synonym of Tourbat, Malvoisie du Roussillon, Tourbat has no known relation with other grapes that share Malvoisie as a name or synonym-most notably Pinot gris but also Bourboulenc, Clairette, Macabeo and Vermentino.

Bob Andy's Song Book

"Bob Andy's Song Book" is a 1970 album of songs by Jamaican reggae singer and songwriter Bob Andy, recorded between 1966 and 1968. Andy had first found fame as the lead vocalist of The Paragons, but his peak as a solo artist came in the late '60s when he recorded a string of singles for Clement "Coxsone" Dodd's Studio One label. In 1970, these singles were compiled on the "Song Book" album. Many of the songs on the album have since been covered by a range of artists, including Taj Mahal, who covered "Desperate Lover" on his 1974 "Mo' Roots" album. Vocal harmony on three tracks on the album are performed by Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh of The Wailers, and backing comes from Studio One band the Soul Vendors, whose members included Jackie Mittoo and Roland Alphonso. The album was re-issued on CD in 1997, with extended versions of "Desperate Lover" and "Feeling Soul". In the Rough Guides book "Reggae: 100 Essential CDs", the album is described as "a masterpiece that belongs in anyone's CD collection - and not just of reggae music", and it has also been described as "one of the era's classic albums".
Although the songs on the album have generated considerable royalties, Andy was not financially rewarded as Dodd claimed that, as with much of Andy's songwriting work, he had written the songs himself.

Vespaiola

Vespaiola is a white Italian wine grape variety planted primarily in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy where it is often dried to produce "passito" style dessert wines. Along with Friulano, Vespaiola is an important component in the "Denominazione di origine controllata" (DOC) white wine of Breganze produced in the province of Vicenza. 
Vespaiola grapes ripen to high sugar levels and are used to produce sweet wines with a characteristic golden hue. In fact, the grapes of Vespaiola get so concentrated with sugars that the name Vespaiola comes from "Vespa" in reference to wasps that are attracted to the sugary aromas in vineyards.
Despite its similar sounding name, Vespaiola should not be confused with red Italian wine grape, Vespolina, which is grown in the Piedmont and Lombardy regions.
Wine regions.
The Breganze DOC, located in the foothills of the Alps, contains a significant number of plantings of Vespaiola where the grape can be included in the generic Breganze blend or produced in a varietal style. To be included in the DOC wine, the grapes must be harvested up to a maximum yield 14 tonnes/hectare (13 tonnes for the varietal style) with the finished wine fermented to a minimum alcohol level of 11% (11.5% for the varietal style). 
For the Breganze white blend, up to 15% Vespaiola is permitted to blended primarily with Friulano with Pinot bianco, Pinot grigio, Riesling Italico and Sauvignon blanc also potentially included in the blend. The varietal style Vespaiola must be made entirely of the single variety, harvested to more limited yields and produced with a higher alcohol level. A "superiore" style is also permitted if the wine achieves at least a 12% alcohol level. When Vespaiola is used to produce a dessert style wine from partially dried grapes (a "passito") it maybe labeled as "Torcolato".
DOC regions.
The following is a list of DOC wines, beyond Breganze, that include Vespaiola as a permitted grape variety, along with other grapes that may be included in the blend under varying percentages that are regulated under the DOC label.
Viticulture and winemaking.
The name "Vespaiola" is derived from the Latin "vespa" and refers to the wasps that are attracted to the high sugar content in the grapes as they ripen late into the growing season. The wasps' presence can be considered a viticultural hazard due to not only their propensity to damage the grapes in order to get to the sweet pulp inside but also the danger they may cause to vineyard workers in the area. 
In vintages where the climate conditions are favorable, the grapes maybe left on the vine to desiccate and further concentrate the sugars well into January. They could also be harvested earlier and left to dry inside special drying rooms where they are may be hung from the ceilings or spread out on mats to dry.
Even with the long ripening periods and high sugar concentrations, the Vespaiola grape can still maintain a relatively high level of acidity that can help balance the sweetness in the resulting wines. After fermentation, some producers will age the wines in oak barrels.
Wine styles.
The "passito" styles of Vespaiola are characterized by a golden color with aromas of apricots, honeysuckles and spice that can be a byproduct of aging in oak. The naturally high acidity of the grapes can help balance the high sugar content producing what wine expert Oz Clarke describes as ""one of Italy's finest sweet wines."" In recent years, producers in Berganze have experimented with producing Sauternes-style wine from Vespaiola, Friulano and other white grapes that have been infected with "Botrytis cinerea".
While Vespaiola is often used to produce sweet dessert wines, it can also be fermented to dryness where it usually produces a light-bodied wines with high acidity and very little of the aroma notes that tend to characterize the grape's sweeter incarnations.
Synonyms.
Over the years Vespaiola and its wines have been known under various synonyms including Bresparola, Bresparola Bianca, Orisi bianca, Uva Vespera, Vespaia, Vespaiolo, Vespajola, Vespajuola Di Bassano, Vesparola, and Vespera.

Lartington Hall

Lartington Hall is a 17th-century country house, at Lartington, Teesdale, County Durham, England. It is a Grade II* listed building.
The earliest part of the house, built for the Appleby family, is the three storey four bayed central block and projecting three storey porch, which dates from about 1635. The west wing and chapel dedicated to St Lawrence were added in about 1800 and the west wing and ballroom were built possibly to a design by Ignatius Bonomi in 1836. Further alterations in about 1860 were supervised by architect Joseph Hansom.
The Roman Catholic family of Maire acquired the manor of Lartington by marriage in 1654. It passed to the Lawson family when Sir Henry Lawson Bt (d 1834)
of Brough Hall married Anna Anastasia the Maire heiress. Their grandson Henry Thomas Maire Silvertop who inherited the estate married Eliza Witham and changed his surname to Witham. As Henry Witham he was High Sheriff of Durham in 1844. His fourth son Right Reverend Monsignor Thomas Edward Witham lived in the Hall from 1847 until his death in 1897 when the estate passed to his grandnephew Francis Silvertop of Minsteracres who sold it out of the family in 1912. In the intervening years the house was let to Richard Forster Matthews and then to his nephew Frederick Berkley-Matthews.
Norman Field and later his widow owned the house but after her death it stood empty and neglected for some years. A restoration project by Mr and Mrs Robin Rackham with the assistance of English Heritage commenced in 1980 beginning with extensive works to the roof. In 2011, Lartington Hall was purchased by Mr & Mrs Harper-Wilkes who embarked on a full and extensive restoration of the hall. The hall is now available as a luxury high end exclusive hire venue.

Michele Granger

Michele Granger (born January 15, 1970) is an American, former collegiate four-time First Team All American, left-handed softball pitcher originally from Placentia, California. She played four seasons, over 5 years, for the California Golden Bears from 1989-1993. She is a champion at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics for Team USA softball. She currently holds numerous pitching records for the Bears and ranks top-10 in several career categories all-time in the NCAA Division I.
Valencia High School.
Granger was a standout pitcher from 1985–1988 and still holds national top-10 records for career ERA (0.10), no-hitters (36) and strikeouts (1,635). On two occasions she also struck out a single game record 21 batters over 7 innings pitched during her 1986 and 1987 campaigns. Against La Mirada High School on June 2, 1988, Granger ended her career tallying 40 strikeouts in the Southern Section 3-A softball semifinals.
As a sophomore, Granger would also make her first Team USA roster during the summer of 1986 and competed at the World Championships under head coach Ralph Raymond. She remained a member until after the 1996 Olympics.
University of California-Berkeley.
1989:<br>
On February 16, Granger tossed her first career no-hitter against the New Mexico State Aggies, a 8-0, 5-inning perfect game. Owing to an inflammation in her pitching hand, Granger withdrew for the season midway to recover.
1990:<br>
Resuming her freshman season, Granger twirled 5 no-hitters, led her team with a career best 0.35 ERA and posted the best strikeout ratio with the most strikeouts in the NCAA to garner All American status and All-Pac-10 honors, leading the conference in wins and strikeouts.
1991:<br>
Granger threw four no-hitters and one perfect game. She broke and set school season records for wins (33), strikeouts (463) (both led the Pac-10) and shutouts (25), all of which now rank second all-time for the Bears. And she maintained her hold on the best strikeout ratio, improving by two strikeouts per inning from the previous year, and strikeouts overall for that year and was again honored All American and All-Pac-10.
For one of her no-hitters, Granger set a school and NCAA record for strikeouts in a single 7-inning game when she whiffed 21 batters in a 3-0 win over the Creighton Bluejays on March 22, 1991.
1992:<br>
Adding 6 more no-hitters, two perfect games and all-season honors, Granger would break her own shutout record by pitching 26, which is the Junior Class record and was second all-time only to Debbie Nichols' NCAA Division I total of 36 set in 1988.
That year Granger led her team to the only Women's College World Series appearance of her career. She responded by shutting out the USF Bulls in their opening game but eventually suffered their second loss 2-0 to defending champions the Arizona Wildcats.
1993:<br>
As a senior, Granger posted 8 no-hitters (one a perfect game) and for the final time repeated all-season honors. For her fourth All American honor, Granger, along with Lisa Fernandez became the first NCAA Division I players to be named to the First Team in four consecutive seasons. She broke her own strikeout total with 484, which led the conference and nation—as she had all three years prior—and set a new NCAA season record, bettering Lisa Ishikawa's 1984 total of 469. On February 22, she broke Shawn Andaya's career strikeout record in a 8-0 win over the Northwestern Wildcats. Granger would reach a career record total of 1,640 and currently remains inside the top-10 all-time.
On March 28 Granger threw her 85th career shutout over the Sacramento State Hornets to claim a new NCAA Division I record. At the close of the season she would have a grand total of 94, now second best all-time. Granger set another single game record in a 12-inning battle with the Oregon Ducks on March 30, posting a career best 26 strikeouts to crack the record of 25 held by Debbie Doom. This single game record now stands second all-time in the NCAA.
Granger would depart with California Golden Bears records in wins, innings pitched, shutouts and strikeouts and still claims her school dominance in those categories. She holds the Pac-10 innings and shutout records, as well as strikeouts for both her single game record totals. Finally, she ranks second all-time in shutouts, 6th in innings, 9th in strikeouts and 15th in ERA overall (10th for a four year career) in the NCAA Division I.
1996 Olympics.
Granger prepared to compete in the inaugural softball tournament to be held in Atlanta, Georgia while working and living in Alaska. After completing the exhibition tour, she would throw the first pitch ever in the Olympics in a 10-0 win over Puerto Rico. Granger struck out 10 and only gave up two hits and a walk.
On July 30, she would post her second win in the gold medal game in which Team USA defeated China 3-1, with Granger pitching the first 5 plus innings, giving up a run, a walk and striking out 8 batters. In 16-innings, Granger had two wins, gave up two earned runs and collected 25 strikeouts, all while three-months pregnant. Granger was second on the team in strikeouts and innings pitched.
1998 and after.
Granger was inducted in the California Golden Bears Hall of Fame in her first year of eligibility.
She nabbed her second and third Hall of Fame entries on the same night, November 9, 2006, by being inducted into the Amateur Softball Association (ASA) and International Softball Federation (ISF) Softball Halls of Fame.
She worked on the coaching staff of the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers softball team and currently volunteers at Sierra College while coaching high school softball.

Eileen Donaghy

Eileen Donaghy (16 July 1930 – 26 October 2008) was an Irish traditional singer. Donaghy was well known for her recordings of ballads such as "The Oul Lammas Fair" and "My Lagan Love" and was known as the "First Lady of the Moy".
Eileen Donaghy was born Mary Josephine McNally in Brackaville, Coalisland, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. Her family always called her Maisie. She was the second of three children and the elder daughter of Hugh Pat McNally and Brigid (née Corey).
Donaghy left school at 14 and worked as a darner in Derryvale weaving factory. She was one of a variety group that performed in local halls.
Donaghy married Tyrone footballer Pat Donaghy. The couple lived for a while in Coalisland, before moving to Pat's home town of Moy. Her big breakthrough was the 1958 Ulster Football Final at Clones where she sang "The Boys From the County Armagh" to a packed stadium. She had an instantly recognizable voice, with a clear and cheerful quality, which won her legions of fans around the world in the dozens of LPs and EPs she recorded.
She toured the world as part of the traditional folk scene in the early 1960s and was successful in Ireland, the UK, New Zealand, Australia, the US and Canada. One of her albums, "Let's Sing With The Irish" was issued on Fontona (Philips) Records in the UK and Epic Records in the US simultaneously.
She also recorded an album of rebel songs, during the times of "the troubles" in Northern Ireland. However, to avoid any problems or controversy she recorded this one album under the name of her granny, Brigid Corey. This rebel songs album was reissued on CD by Outlet Recording Company before they went defunct in the 1990s.
Her husband Pat died in 1991. They had nine children.
Donaghy's recording of "My Lagan Love" was included in the BBC Programme The One Hundred Best Tunes.

Žilavka

Žilavka is a white wine grape variety planted primarily in the Mostar region of Herzegovina, the southern area of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a varietal, Žilavka is known for its bright freshness and acidity. Ideal for general meal pairings, it is often oak aged as a "barrique" vintage that present more full bodied and earthy wines with nutty aspects that were more prevalent in the wines produced in the early 2000s and before. 
Widely planted throughout the former Yugoslavia, Žilavka used to only be a minor blending grape that was used throughout the former country. These days, the wine has come in to its own and is bottled as a single varietal alongside the other main grape of Herzegovina wine production, Blatina. 
Production is generally focused in the area south of Mostar around the villages of Čitluk, Međugorje, Ljubuški, and Čapljina with notable producers such as Nuić, Škegro, Brkić, Vinarija Čitluk, and Vitai/Gangaš.

1879 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1879 Atlantic hurricane season ran from the summer to near the end of autumn in 1879. In 1879 there were two tropical storms, four hurricanes, and two major hurricanes (Category 3+). However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. Of the known 1879 cyclones, Hurricane One were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz. They also proposed large changes to the known tracks of Hurricanes Two, Three, Seven and Eight. Later one storm was deemed not to be a tropical cyclone at all and was dropped from the database.
__TOC__
Season summary.
The Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) recognizes eight tropical cyclones for the 1879 season. Two were tropical storms and six were hurricanes, with winds of 75 mph (119 km/h) or greater. The first storm of the season formed as a tropical storm off the Carolinas on August 9. It briefly reached Category 1 hurricane strength before dissipating on August 12 off Newfoundland. The second cyclone of the year was a major Category 3 hurricane. Known as The Great Beaufort Hurricane, it caused extensive damage to both North Carolina and Virginia. Hurricane Three made landfalls at both the Yucatan Peninsula and near Galveston, Texas, causing great damage along the Louisiana coast. Hurricane Four was the second Category 3 cyclone of the year and,like Hurricane Three, also struck the Gulf coast. In this case the damage and destruction were centred on Morgan City,Louisiana. Tropical Storm Five existed between October 3 and 7th and dissipated over Louisiana. Tropical Storm Six travelled from east of Barbados to make landfall first on Isla de la Juventud, then Cuba and later Florida. Hurricane Seven began as a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea, before crossing Florida and travelling north, parallel to the US east coast. The last cyclone of the year was a Category 2 hurricane that developed from a tropical storm as it travelled from close to Hispaniola to a point off Atlantic Canada before dissipating on November 20.
Storms.
Hurricane One.
A tropical storm was first discovered on August 9, offshore of the Carolinas. It grew to a Category 1 hurricane as it paralleled the North Carolina coast throughout August 11. It moved out to sea, dissipating offshore of Atlantic Canada on August 12.
Hurricane Two.
Hurricane Two, also known as The Great Beaufort Hurricane, was first seen on August 13 as a tropical storm near the Windward Islands. It passed to the north of the islands, and became a hurricane near the Bahamas on August  16. It continued northward, and hit eastern North Carolina on the morning of August 18 as a hurricane. At 6 a.m. that morning anemometer cups at Cape Lookout were blown away when indicating and the wind was afterward estimated to have reached . Anemometers were also destroyed at Hatteras, Fort Macon, Kitty Hawk, Portsmouth, and Cape Henry, Virginia, with speeds estimated at or more. A storm surge up to 8 feet high was seen at Norfolk,Virginia.
After crossing the state it moved to into the northwestern Atlantic, crossing Cape Cod and Nova Scotia before becoming extratropical on August 20. The hurricane was responsible for 46 deaths, as well as great damage in North Carolina and Virginia.
Hurricane Three.
A tropical storm was first seen in the Western Caribbean on August 19. On August 20, it made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula as a Category 1 hurricane. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and restrengthened into a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. There it reached its peak intensity of 100 mph and a minimal pressure of 964 mb. It made landfall east of Galveston, Texas near the border with Louisiana. At Calcasieu Pass a tidal wave grounded twelve vessels high and dry. Further along the Louisiana coast many buildings were destroyed and crops ruined. The system rapidly weakened and dissipated on August 24.
Hurricane Four.
A tropical storm was first seen on August 28 in the Gulf of Mexico. By the end of the next day it had strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane,and by the end of August 31, it had reached Category 3 status. Throughout the morning of September 1 the hurricane maintained wind speeds of 130 mph while making landfall in Louisiana, near Morgan City. Damage was extensive;- trees were uprooted, a sawmill, some cabins and two churches were destroyed while flooding washed away bridges. It weakened to a Category 2 hurricane by the end of September 1, and the next day weakened further to a tropical depression. Hurricane Four caused $500,000 in damage. 
Tropical Storm Five.
A tropical storm formed on October 2, about half way between Jamaica and Panama. It grazed Cuba and made landfall in Louisiana before it dissipated on October 7.
Tropical Storm Six.
A tropical storm was first seen on October 8 east of Barbados. On October 9 it moved through the Leeward and Windward Islands. It moved across the Caribbean and passed near Jamaica on October 12. On October 13, the storm made landfall on Isla de la Juventud and on Cuba itself shortly thereafter. Early on October 16, it made landfall on the Florida Panhandle and dissipated later that day.
Hurricane Seven.
A tropical storm was discovered in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on October 24. It made landfall in Florida in the Big Bend Area as a 70 mph tropical storm. Later the storm paralleled the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Atlantic Canada. On October 29 it briefly became a Category 1 hurricane before it dissipated the same day.
Hurricane Eight.
On November 18, a tropical storm formed to the north of Hispaniola. It grew to a Category 1 hurricane the next day. On November 20 it reached its peak intensity of 100 mph winds, before becoming extratropical. The extratropical storm affected Atlantic Canada with winds equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane.

NZ Classic Car magazine

NZ Classic Car is a monthly automotive magazine and website that covers all things related to classic and historic cars, events, clubs, and related car culture in New Zealand and to a lesser extent Australia.
It was the first magazine to be published after the inception of Parkside Media. The publication began as a simple idea to put local classic car owners in touch with shows, events, car clubs and trade professionals, and the people chosen to write for the magazine, and to highlight the local classic car scene, were all passionate about the subject, all of them being classic car owners themselves.
It is one of the longest running motoring magazines in New Zealand and is the third biggest selling car magazine behind NZ Performance Car and NZ Autocar.
The magazine celebrated its 200th issue in August 2007. Originally in black and white newsprint format the magazine is now glossy and perfect bound.
The magazine and its contributors act as a voice for, and stand up for the rights of, people who want to enjoy classic and historic motoring. It has also featured many New Zealand motorsport personalities whose stories would have otherwise been forgotten or ignored, including Ross Jensen, Robbie Francevic, Ron Roycroft, Hec Green, Ralph Watson, Johnny Riley, Ken Smith, Spinner Black, and Howden Ganley.
A NZ Classic Car Yearbook is published just before Christmas. Five special issues on New Zealand motorsport and motoring history have also been published.
NZ Classic Car's offices are in Grey Lynn, Auckland, New Zealand.
Government policy.
The magazine is one of several that are recognised authorities by the New Zealand Government for defining a classic car or special interest vehicle and is usually mentioned in policy documents relating to transport changes that will affect classic and historic cars by Land Transport New Zealand.
Magazine contents.
As of the November 2008 issue, the typical magazine contents include:
Website.
Daily news articles are available weekdays which are additional to magazine content. Full magazine articles are available from previous issues, often including additional photos and information (including videos) that could not be fitted into the magazine.
Some writers run blogs on the website, and a forum is run as a subsite to encourage user interaction.
Users can purchase books related to classic and historic cars, as well as back issues and subscriptions in the online shop. Crosswords from previous issues are loaded online.
Editorial staff.
Editor Allan Walton has been with the magazine since its inception, taking over the editorial reins at issue 101. Well known in the classic motoring scene having been involved with classic cars since the early 1980s, Walton co-authored – along with acclaimed Christchurch photographer, Terry Marshall – Looking Back: The Motorsport Photography of Terry Marshall, a photo-book highlighting New Zealand motorsport from the 1960s to the 1980s. The previous editor of NZ Classic Car was Greg Vincent, owner of Parkside Media.
Controversy.
NZ Classic Car has argued for the continued enjoyment of classic and historic cars by their owners. This has occasionally seen it make submissions to New Zealand government that may not be considered to be the most environmentally friendly options. NZ Classic Car argued to keep leaded petrol, and for exemptions on exhaust emissions for classic cars.
Support of Targa in New Zealand.
NZ Classic Car supported and sponsored Targa New Zealand from the first running in 1995. NZ Classic Car and Targa parted ways after the 2006 event.
Intermarque Concours d'Elegance.
Located at Ellerslie Racecourse, the Intermarque Concours d'Elegance runs every February. Held in Auckland, it is New Zealand's largest concours event. NZ Classic Car has had a presence at every event since 1991, and since 2004 has been the event's main sponsor.
Awards.
Long-time contributor Trevor Stanley-Joblin, and publisher Greg Vincent have both been recipients of the Meguiar's Collector's Car Person of the Year Award.

University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law

The University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law is a public law school located on the main campus of the University of Missouri-Kansas City in Kansas City, Missouri. It was founded in 1895 as the Kansas City School of Law, a private, independent law school located in Downtown Kansas City, and was purchased by the University of Missouri-Kansas City in 1938. The law school moved to UMKC's main campus soon after, where it is accredited by the American Bar Association and is a member of the Association of American Law Schools.
It is one of four law schools in Missouri (St. Louis University School of Law, University of Missouri Columbia School of Law, Washington University School of Law). It is one of eight American law schools to have produced both a President of the United States (Harry S. Truman) and a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (Charles Evans Whittaker). Truman attended but did not graduate from the law school and never practiced law. The other schools that have had President-Supreme Court graduates who practiced law are Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, Columbia Law School, the University of Virginia School of Law, the William & Mary Law School, the University of Cincinnati College of Law, and the Albany Law School.
Rankings.
The school is ranked #113 best law school in the U.S by the U.S News publication, placing it in the third tier according to the four tier system of law schools based on the U.S. News & World Report Annual Rankings. (2010 data)

Stord (island)

Stord is an island in the county of Hordaland, Norway. Located in the district of Sunnhordland, the island is covered by Stord (southern part) and Fitjar (northern part) municipalities. The largest settlements are Leirvik, Sagvåg and Fitjar. Stord has an area of .
Fitjar.
Fitjar is the village that lies on the northern part of the Island of Stord.
Early history.
The area around Fitjar has been settled since the Stone Age. At that time the sea was higher than today, which means that it went into Storavatnet(Largewater lake) and far up Fitjar river. The mild climate of the last ice age meant that much of the area was covered by forest, most probably oak, ash and lime, and the area was rich with wildlife, deer and wild boar. Archaeologists said there have been people on Fitjar in 10,000 years, and it's made many discoveries of stone tools around the Fitjar, but these strains were essentially itinerant and was here only for periods of time. By Rimbareid was nevertheless found a Stone Age dwellings under a cairn, which was examined by archaeologist E. de Lange in 1906. This residence is probably from the late stone age, but can also be from the early Bronze Age, since residue showed a square house, while the round house was more common in the stone age.
Fitjar today.
Fitjar, municipality in Hordaland county, northwestern Sunnhordland is about. 350 islands, islets and reefs on the south side of Selbjørn area, going in from the North Sea of Bømlo and Stord. The majority () of Fitjar located on the northwestern part of the island of Stord. Border Control with Bømlo 1995, Aga and Agasøster islands in the east and Vikøy and Gisøy in the north were transferred to Bømlo (approximately ).
Industry and business.

Agriculture is dominated by cattle and sheep farming. Fitjar ranks second after Austevoll Sunnhordland in terms of landed volume of fish.
Stord.
Early history.
Slate on Stord contains much pyrite. The green stone at Litlabø had operations after pyrite until 1968. On Vikanes have been marble quarries, and on Huglo has limestone quarries been an important source of extra income from 1500-century. Behind the lowlands, along a line from Sagvåg in the southwest to Jektevik in the northeast, rises a hill dragon with peaks of over 700 meters., Highest when Mehammarsåto (749 m above sea level.) furthest to the north. In this mountainous section has various heavy sprinkling large rocks, ma converted basalt lava, ryolittlava, gabbro and granite.

<doc id="20044517" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20044517" title="Shogi strategy and tactics">
Shogi strategy and tactics

Shogi, or Japanese Chess, is similar to chess but has a much larger game tree complexity because of the use of drops. 
However, like chess, the game can be divided into the opening, middle game and endgame, each requiring a different strategy. The opening consists of arranging one's defenses and positioning for attack, the mid game consists of attempting to break through the opposing defenses while maintaining one's own, and the end game starts when one side's defenses have been compromised.
The basic tactics of shogi are similar to those of chess, involving forks, pins, removing the defender and other techniques, all of which are considered very strong when used effectively.
Opening.
The opening of shogi is generally slower than that of chess, due to the larger board and less mobile pieces. But since a quick offense will leave a player's home territory open to drop attacks as soon as pieces are exchanged, the aim of the opening is to build up defenses for the king, typically by moving the king to the side in a castle with three generals. Leaving a king on its original square (居玉 "igyoku" or "sitting king") is a particularly dangerous position.
Both players can move the rook pawn forward, or, more commonly, advance the pawn above and to the right of the bishop. The former is known as a "rook opening" and the latter a "bishop opening." With a bishop opening, it's common to exchange bishops by having one capture the other. This allows each player to put their newly captured bishop into play anywhere on the board. However, it is not advantageous to exchange bishops if your opponent has a better defensive setup, or more lines of attack.
Openings are also classified as "static rook" (居飛車 "ibisha") openings, where the offense is supported by the rook in its original position, and "ranging rook" (振り飛車 "furibisha") openings, where the rook moves to the center or left of the board to support an attack there, typically with the idea of allowing the opponent to attack while arranging a better defense and aiming for a counterattack. However, as the most powerful piece on the board, the rook invites attack, and in most cases, especially for weaker players, it is a good idea to keep the king well away from the rook.
Many common opening attacks involve advancing a silver, and ideally a pawn, along a file protected by the rook. This is the "climbing silver" attack. Because silvers have more possibilities for retreat, while golds better defend their sides, silvers are generally considered superior as attacking pieces, and golds superior as defensive pieces. It is common practice to defend the king with three generals, two golds and a silver.
Because defense is so important, and because shogi pieces are relatively slow movers, the opening game tends to be much longer in shogi than in international chess, commonly with a dozen or more moves to shore up defenses before the initial attack is made. There are several strong defensive fortifications known as "castles." There are many variations and types of castles which can be used, but it is essential to understand which ones are useful in the current situation and how to compensate for its weak points.
The Yagura castle.
The "Yagura castle" (矢倉囲い "Yagura gakoi)" is considered by many to be the strongest defensive position in shogi. It has a strongly protected king; a well fortified line of pawns; and the bishop, rook, and a pawn all support a later attack by the rook's silver or knight. It is notoriously difficult to break down with a frontal assault, though it is weaker from the side. It is typically used against static rook openings that involve advancing the rook's pawn. However, one's opponent may just as easily adopt this defense, giving neither side an advantage. 
There is a good deal of flexibility in the order of moves when building the Yagura defense, and the possibilities will not be listed here. The only point to keep in mind is that the generals should move diagonally, not directly forward. However, there is a strong intermediate position called the "kani" ("crab"). It has the three pawns on the left side advanced to their final Yagura positions, and on the second rank all four generals are lined up next to the bishop, which is still in its starting position: "bishop-gold-silver-gold-silver." The king is moved one square to the left, behind the middle silver.
While forming the castle, the rook's pawn is often advanced two squares in preparation for a "climbing rook" assault on the opposing king. Another common preparation is to advance the adjacent silver's pawn square, allowing passage for both the rook's silver and knight. These offensive moves are not properly part of the castle, but the two-square pawn advance must be carried out early if there is to be room for it, and so it is often done while still castling. 
A common attack against the Yagura defense is to advance the rook's knight directly forward, defended by the rook and with a pawn in hand, to attack the fortifications on either side of the castled king. If the defender has answered a lance's pawn advance on that side, a pawn may be dropped where the edge pawn had been. If the defending silver has moved or is not yet in position, a pawn may be dropped there.
The Mino castle.
A defensive position that is considered easier for beginners, but still popular with professionals, is the Mino castle (美濃囲い "Minō gakoi)." The King is placed in a safe position, while the three generals work well to back each other up. This is sometimes used when a player chooses a bishop opening rather than the rook-pawn opening.
The Mino castle takes six steps to complete, not necessarily in this order:
The Anaguma castle.
A third defense often used in professional shogi is the "Anaguma" (穴熊 lit. "bear in the hole", and which means　"hibernating bear".), commonly called the "bear in the hole" castle in English (穴熊囲い "Anaguma gakoi"). This castle can be executed on either side of the board, i.e. either by a player utilizing the ranging rook strategy or by a player employing the static rook strategy. The end-result will place the king in the corner square where the lance started, defended by two gold generals and one silver.
One suggested strategy for a rook-side castle is:
Middle game.
Professional shogi players tend to evaluate the 'flow' of the game, that is, the sequence of moves leading to the current position and its likely development, much more than chess players.
Because pawns attack head on, and cannot defend each other, they tend to be lost early in the game, providing ammunition for such attacks. Dropping a pawn behind enemy lines, promoting it to a "tokin" (gold general), and dropping a second pawn immediately behind the "tokin" so that they protect each other makes a strong attack; it threatens the opponent's entire defense, but provides little value to the opponent if the attack fails and the pieces are captured.
Players raised on international chess often make poor use of drops, but dropping is half the game. If a player has more than a couple of captured pieces in hand, it is likely that dropping attacks are being overlooked. However, it is wise to keep a pawn in hand, and often to exchange pieces if necessary to get one. Compared with international chess players, shogi players are more likely to sacrifice pieces, even powerful ones, if the resulting capture can be dropped back into play for a specific purpose.
Attacking pieces can easily become trapped behind enemy lines, as the opponent can often drop a pawn on a protected square to cut off the line of retreat. For this reason, rooks, which can retreat in only one direction, are commonly kept at a safe distance in the early parts of the game, and used to support attacks by weaker pieces. However, once the game has opened up, a promoted rook is an especially deadly piece behind enemy lines. 
Advancing a lance pawn can open up the side of the board for attack. Therefore, when a player first advances a lance pawn, it is common, though not obligatory, for the opponent to answer by advancing the opposing pawn, in order to avoid complications later in the game. It also allows the king to escape if attacked from the side.
End game.
The collapse of one side's defense marks the beginning of the end game. Once a player has broken through the enemy lines, the opponent's king can be easily trapped by its own pieces. A common last-ditch defensive tactic is to open the pawn line to allow the king to escape. Kings are more difficult to checkmate in the open, especially if the opponent does not have many ranged pieces in play.
In the endgame, it comes down to a race over who can checkmate the opponent first. A tactic known as "speed counting" plays an important role in the endgame. By counting the number of moves until checkmate (assuming the opponent doesn't get to move) for both Black and White, this will help to influence decisions on whether to attack or defend. A simple mistake can change the flow of the game drastically. Among this, there are many other delicate factors to look out for within the endgame, including sacrificial attacks and traps.

Peggy Sue (singer)

Peggy Sue Webb (born March 24, 1947) is a country music singer and songwriter, who had brief success as a country singer in the late 60s. She is the sister of two popular country performers, Loretta Lynn and Crystal Gayle.
Biography.
She was born Peggy Sue Webb in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky. She moved to Indiana at the age of 12 due to her father's illness. She then began performing with her sisters in Indiana, and then became a featured act in Lynn's early shows. Sue helped write a few of Lynn's compositions, including "Don't Come Home A' Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)."
In 1969, she signed with Decca Records and released her debut single, "I'm Dynamite," which went into the Country Top 30. That year, she released an album of the same name, and the second single from that album titled, "I'm Gettin' Tired of Babyin' You" also reached the Top 30.
After Sue had a hit with her most successful single, "All-American Husband," she left Decca Records after releasing two albums. She recorded two albums in the 70s for two small labels. 
Peggy Sue was married twice, once to Doug Wells(m.1964-div.1966) and once to Sonny Wright(m.1968-). From her first marriage, Peggy has 1 daughter: Doyletta(-). From her second marriage, Peggy has a son and daughter from her 2nd marriage: Georgia() and Layla().
After 1970, she didn't appear on the Billboard country charts until 1980, where she had a string of minor hits off of her second husband Sonny Wright's label Doorknob. After 1983, her success declined and she began performing as a background singer and designing stage costumes for her sister, Crystal Gayle.
She continues to perform today, occasionally with her two sisters. She had a daughter named Doyletta, who was murdered by her daughter's then-husband.

CYT006-AngQb

CYT006-AngQb was an investigational vaccine against angiotensin II, designed to lower blood pressure. It was somewhat effective in clinical trials, but less so than conventional drugs against hypertension (elevated blood pressure).
Method of action.
Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to constrict, and drives blood pressure up. CYT006-AngQb consists of virus-like particles covalently coupled to angiotensin II. Subcutaneous injection causes the immune system to produce antibodies which reduce angiotensin II blood levels, lowering blood pressure. 
Studies.
In a 2008 phase IIa study, 72 patients received 100 µg, 300 µg or placebo in weeks 0, 4, and 12. Blood pressure was lowered dose-dependently, by 5.6 mmHg (systolic) and 2.8 mmHg (diastolic) in the 300 µg group. Morning blood pressure (8:00) was lowered by 25 mmHg (systolic) and 13 mmHg (diastolic).
Side effects were mild and included local reactions, headache and fatigue.
The 2008 trial was small and exploratory. It did not address the question of whether the vaccine actually protects internal organs, nor did it address safety concerns such as whether the vaccine would cause autoimmune disease. If a standard drug treatment is found to dangerously inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, it can be withdrawn and the effects reversed quickly, but that would not be true of the vaccine. However, poor compliance to standard treatment is the main reason for inadequate control of blood pressure, and if vaccination were safe and effective in the long run, it may solve many compliance problems.
CYT006-AngQb did not reach Phase III studies because the antihypertensive effects were small compared to existing ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and they were not reproducible across dosing schemes. Similar vaccines with modified immunogens and different adjuvants are being investigated.

In the INEGI 2005 Census, San Francisco Javier de Satevó reported a total population of 450.
History.
San Francisco Javier de Satevó was founded as a mission by the Jesuit missionary José Pascual in 1640.
The mission was, however, destroyed in a Tarahumara revolt in 1652 and not rebuilt until 1674 under Fr. Juan Sarmiento.
Fidel Ávila, Governor of Chihuahua in 1914 and 1915, was born in San Francisco Javier de Satevó in 1875.
On 24 December 1918, General Francisco Villa, at the head of a column of some 900 men of the División del Norte, attacked San Francisco Javier de Satevó. The settlement's defence, comprising 70 men under Pedro Alonso, refused to yield. 
The Villistas gradually forced back the defenders into the parish church, to which they set fire before sacking the village.

Gaston d'Illiers

Gaston d'Illiers (1876–1932) was a French animalier sculptor who specialised in horses. His bronze statuettes are very realistic.
Biography.
Gaston d'Illiers devoted all his life to his two passions: horses and sculpture. He was a very fine rider and showed a deep knowledge of horses. He decided to become a sculptor and took to modelling horses.
His statues were very appreciated from the start. He showed his productions in specialised exhibitions like "salon des artistes français" from 1899 to his death. He gained quite a reputation among horse experts and art connoisseurs. For example during his life the statue "avant la course" (before the race) was often given as a prize to the winner of a horse race or jumping.
His private life was quiet. He was a count and spent all his life in the centre of France, in Orléans and Olivet.
He often went hunting on horseback with friends in the woods nearby (Orleans forest, Sologne), and some of his works are related to hunting : "le piqueux", "la curée", "retour de chasse"...
He went twice on trips to Algeria in 1899 and 1910, and these trips gave him inspiration for some works which are still very appreciated: "jument arabe", "fauconniers", "fantasia"...
Works.
The works of Gaston d'Illiers, small bronze horses, are fine and elegant works of art. They are particularly appreciated by horse lovers because of their precision and fidelity to nature.
During his life, Gaston d'Illiers created around 200 statues. They are all of small size, less than half a meter in each of the 3 dimensions. He modelled them in wax or plaster. The models were then molded to produce a limited number of statues in bronze. Most of the models have been damaged during World War II. The manufacturing of the bronze statues is still going on with the remaining models, but on an extremely limited scale. The existing bronze statues are kept by the owners, who seldom sell them. The appearance of a Gaston d'Illiers statue in a sale or a shop is therefore a rare event.
The works of Gaston d'Illiers show all types of horse including riding horses, driving horses, military horses, and draft horses. Many breeds are represented: Selle français, Anglo-Arabian, Thoroughbred, Cob, Boulonnais, Percheron.
When persons are present (rider, driver, groom), they are of little importance whereas the horse remains the centre of attention.
Many works are actually portraits of real horses, which accounts for their realism and accuracy. Some are winners of jumping: "Idylle", "Bulletin rose", "Rosette XIV"... Others are his own horses or horses belonging to acquaintances : "Violette", "Jack", "Colibri", "Esmeralda", "Miss", "Prince", "Dolly", "Sydney", "sous-off", "Lady Hareford", "la ruade or poney Coco ruant", "cheval aux champs or Coquet au trot", "cheval sans terrasse or Sweetheart"...

Beyond Humanity

Beyond Humanity is the third full-length album by Interface. It was released by Nilaihah Records on March 14, 2006.
The album was the band's first to be recorded and produced entirely within the environment of the computer, with little hardware instrumentation. It was also the band's first album in nearly four years thanks to the demise of the Tinman record label at the end of 2005. By that point the band had already committed to recording a new album, and began to shop it to other labels. Landing on Nilaihah in early 2006, the album saw the light of day March 14 with a series of bonus tracks added on. Some of these were remixes of songs on the album while others were of earlier material from "Angels In Disguise" songs, and the last track "Doubts And Fears" was exclusive to a compilation CD. To make room for the latter, the band was forced to drop a track from the original listing named "Darkness Prevails", which did appear when the band held a listening party premiere on the Side Line chat room in October 2005.
The cover art was done by Evan Eldredge, who at the time was still a member of the band. (He left the band for good later in the year, and his name doesn't appear in the album's notes as a member.) It depicts human DNA superimposed over images of printed circuitry.

Bud Heidgerken

Bud Heidgerken is a Minnesota politician and a former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives. A Republican, he represented District 13A, which includes portions of Kandiyohi, Pope and Stearns counties in the west central part of the state.
Heidgerken was first elected in 2002, and was re-elected in 2004 and 2006. He did not seek re-election in 2008, and was succeeded by Rep. Paul Anderson of Starbuck.
Heidgerken graduated from St. John's Prep School in St. Joseph and St. Cloud State University in St. Cloud. He taught school in the Brooten School System and, later, the Belgrade-Brooten-Elrosa School System for 21 years. He and his wife also owned Charlie's Cafe in Freeport for many years. He was a member of the Freeport City Council and the Freeport School Board, and also served as president of the Stearns Electric Trust Board.
Heidgerken made news in the 2008 legislative session by being one of six house Republicans to vote to override Governor Tim Pawlenty's veto of a transportation bill. The bill increased money spent on transportation by raising the gas tax. Due to dissatisfaction in the Republican caucus with this vote, he and the other Republicans who voted to override the veto had their leadership positions taken away. He decided to retire after the session, partially due to the controversy surrounding this vote. Other house members who voted to override faced caucus challenges or decided to retire, as well.

Clärenore Stinnes

Clara Eleonore Stinnes (known as Clärenore; 21 January 1901 – 7 September 1990) was a German car racer; she and Swedish cinematographer Carl-Axel Söderström were the first people to circumnavigate the world by automobile.
Stinnes was born in Mülheim to the German industrialist and politician Hugo Stinnes. At the age of 24 she participated in her first motor race; by 1927 she had won 17 races and was one of the most successful race car drivers in Europe. On 25 May 1927 Stinnes started to journey around the world, together with Carl-Axel Söderström, whom she had met only two days before her departure, in a mass production Adler Standard 6 automobile and escorted by two mechanics and a freight vehicle with spare parts and equipment. The journey was sponsored by the German automotive industry (Adler, Bosch and Aral) with 100,000 Reichsmark. 
They passed through the Balkans via Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad and Tehran to Moscow, where the two mechanics left, then they travelled to Siberia, crossed the frozen Lake Baikal and the Gobi desert and came to Peking. They travelled by ferry to Japan, later to Hawaii and South America. They transited Middle and South America, travelled the Cordillera as far as Buenos Aires, and then continued to Vancouver and New York. In Washington, D.C. Stinnes and Söderström were welcomed by President Herbert Hoover. They travelled by ferry to Le Havre and arrived with their car in Berlin on 24 June 1929, after a journey of by car.
After their happy return Carl-Axel Söderström was divorced; Söderström and Stinnes married and lived on an estate in Sweden, where they raised three children of their own and several foster children. In later years they spent some time of the year in Irmenach. Söderström died in 1976, aged 83, while Stinnes survived her husband by 14 years.

Zagreb local elections, 2005

The Zagreb local elections of 2005 were held on 15 May 2005 in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. On the last local elections, in 2001, Milan Bandić had been re-elected as the mayor of Zagreb. However, a 2002 incident made him resign in favor of Vlasta Pavić, a deputy mayor chosen by Social Democratic Party, Bandić's party. Pavić remained formally in control of the city until 2005. However, she was moved down the list of candidates to the 16th place, returning the local candidacy to Milan Bandić.
The elections mainly pitted the former mayors Milan Bandić (coalition of SDP, HSS and HSU) and Marina Matulović-Dropulić (coalition of HDZ, DC, HSLS and Croatian Demochristians), the two being represented by the two major Croatian political parties, SDP and HDZ (Croatian Democratic Union). SDP gained 25 seats in the Zagreb city council, receiving 40.95% votes, with Milan Bandić winning his third term as the Zagreb mayor.
Coalitions.
After the announcement of Milan Bandić as SDP's mayor candidate, Vesna Pusić, the head of Croatian People's Party (HNS) was vexed by the candidacy, presumably as Bandić had to resign from his earlier term due to a driving under the influence scandal and numerous other affairs. Pusić announced the breakup of the SDP-HNS coalition, which was established in 2000 before Bandić became the mayor of Zagreb for the first time. Due to this breakup, HNS ran together with Liberal Party of Croatia (LS) with Pusić for mayor. However, Pusić's solo campaign wasn't successful and she collected only 8% of votes. The LS was later incorporated into Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS). SDP ran with Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and Croatian Pensioners' Party (HSU), two parties with little influence in Zagreb. The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) entered a coalition with various right-wing and center parties including Democratic Center (DC), Croatian Demochristians (HD) and HSLS.
Results.
Milan Bandić, the leader of the Zagreb SDP, won the elections, starting his third term as the mayor of Zagreb. Even at a turnout of 35%, Bandić received less than 50% of the votes, having won votes of only a seventh of all eligible voters registered in Zagreb in 2005. The runner-up was Marina Matulović-Dropulić, the HDZ candidate, while Miroslav Rožić of HSP finished third.
Local elections candidates in Croatia are either political party representatives or representatives of independent lists. Write-ins are not allowed.

Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster

Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (born 30 June 1965, Strasbourg) is a French artist and an influential figure in international contemporary art. She is known for her great variety of work in video projection, photography, and spatial installations. She has worked in landscaping, design, and writing. "I always look for experimental processes. I like the fact that at the beginning I don't know how to do things and then, slowly, I start learning. Often exhibitions don't give me this learning possibility anymore." 
Biography.
Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster was born in Strasbourg, France in 1965. At the age of 17, she worked as a museum guard in Grenoble while studying at the École du Magasin of the National Centre of Contemporary Art in Grenoble. She also studied at the Institute des Hautes Études en Arts Plastiques, in Paris. She began her career as an artist in the 1990's, working primarily in film. Her early work was mainly short, minimalistic and oneiric films. She now collaborates on everything from the writing of a science fiction novel with fellow artist Philippe Parreno to working with rock singer Alain Bashung on set design. She has also collaborated with fashion house Balenciaga in designing displays for their fashion boutiques in New York and Paris. She has even designed a house for a collector in Tokyo. 
Inspired by film, literature, modernist architecture, and art history, her work is often characterized by a quiet, intimate interrogation of contemporary urban life. Often she will use fragments from her international travels in her work and reassembles them into something new. "My approach to art is quite radical. It has more to do with theater and staging than making objects such as paintings or sculptures. Sometimes I think that the fetishism of objects is pathetic. It's one way to deal with art, but I'm obsessed with other things,". She also hopes that her installations will encourage people to interact with them. "I want to coax people to engage with my art, in the same way that a writer might entice people to read a book,". She was the recipient of an artist residency in Villa Kujoyama, Kyoto in 1996, the Mies van der Rohe Award in Krefeld in 1996, and the 2002 Marcel Duchamp award in Paris. She currently lives and works in Paris and Rio de Janeiro.

Tate Modern's Turbine Hall installation.
The show was entitled "The Unilever Series: Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster: TH.2058" and appeared in the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern in London from October 14, 2008 to April 13, 2009. At the opening of the show Dominique said, " Some months ago, I used to wake up in the silence of the night to think about what I was going to do. But not anymore. People ask me, 'Are you scare?' No, I am not scared. If I was, I wouldn't do it. Rather, I'm excited. I am putting one third of my energy into just staying calm. The work is on such a scale that if you got too excited, you would explode,". The show was her first public commission in the UK and filled half of the 3,400 square meter hall. "TH.2058 by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, imagines Tate Modern 50 years into the future, set in a London afflicted by perpetual rain. Tate Modern is being used as a shelter for people, a storage space for art works and for the remains of culture. The vast Turbine Hall is filled with monumental replicas of iconic sculptural works. Rows of bunk beds are scattered with books, and on a giant screen The Last Film is continuously running. Made up of short excerpts from science-fiction films, The Last Film suggests a potential state of catastrophe as well as the possibility of collective memory,".
Hispanic Society of America installation.
The installation at the Hispanic Society of America in New York was installed in 2009 and was entitled "chronotopes & dioramas". The Hispanic Society of America is a museum and research library with an impressive collection of paintings, decorative objects, books, documents, prints, and photographs. However, Dominique discovered it only had a limited supply of 20th century literature and wanted to fill in the gaps. She enlisted help from experts at the American Museum of Natural History. The project involved crafting three habitats in which volumes by nearly 40 authors replaced taxidermied fauna. One evokes water and verticality; another, aridity and flatness; the third, trailing vines. They represent three zones: North America, the Desert, and the Tropics. Aside from the books, each diorama contains a single, mute trace of human presence. In the underwater ocean scene there is an oil barrel. In the desert scene there are ruins of a concrete bunker. In the tropical scene there is a desolate, glass house. They each show the wear and tear of passing time. Many of the books in the dioramas are about anxiety and exile. She also created a mural-sized calligram (an arrangement of words that creates a related visual image). This is Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the chronotope; "functioning as the primary means for materializing time in space with the novel". The installation is housed in an annex to the library.
