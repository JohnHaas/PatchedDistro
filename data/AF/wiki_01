SkyQuest 5

Record-setting balloon flight.
On February 3, 1995, Dr. Bill Bussey launched an experimental "metal" balloon, and AX-6 hot air balloon, from Chanute, Kansas. By the time the balloon landed outside Savannah it had been piloted , setting records for AX-6, AX-7, AX-8 and AX-9 class hot air balloons. Dr. Bussey still holds this record in two of the four classes. 
Communication director for this record setting attempt, Glen Moyer first recorded the account of this historic journey in 1995 in "Balloon Life" magazine. Moyer recounts February 1995 flight of SkyQuest 5. 
Bob Rice - known as the adventure meteorologist - had been meteorologist for the distance manned balloon flights attempted and completed by Steve Fossett including the first transatlantic, first solo transatlantic, first hot air transatlantic, and first hot air transpacific. It was a cold and windy morning in February 1995 when the call came, and Dr. Bussey's team was quick to get into action. Excited, the team had no idea that they were about to be a part of an historic event as they witnessed Dr. Bussey set and claim four world records and an additional 10 national records in his new balloon. 
It was not long after the first call from Rice that the team of friends and volunteers gathered at Bill Bussey's headquarters, his balloonport in Longview, Texas. As final assembly of all necessary gear was underway, a second phone call from Rice, in the evening, brought confirmation of a good weather pattern. The decision was made to "go". The balloon and equipment was carefully loaded before a quick dinner break and trips home to pack for those in Chase One which included the launch crew. At midnight, Bussey and the Chase One crew left Longview for a drive to Chanute, Kansas which would take all night. Chanute, a small town due west of Wichita, was selected as the launch site by Bob Rice. Finally, the many months of waiting and preparation, Dr. Bussey was about to launch SkyQuest 5 and he was going to assault his own world record for distance in the AX-6 category.
Plans for SkyQuest 5 were born almost two years earlier, shortly after Bussey had successfully claimed seven world records in a flight from Amarillo, Texas to near the Canadian border. Flying a balloon built by Thunder & Colt, the flight convinced Bussey of the validity of "metal" balloons, those built of mylar coated fabrics for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean crossings. Almost upon landing Bussey says he began considering an attempt to break a world record he had set years earlier in 1987-the AX-6 distance record of .
The balloon Dr. Bussey had ordered to be built was an AX-6, envelope built of the same fabric used on the Virgin-Otsuka Pacific Flyer. To minimize any possibility competitors, hearing of his plans would attempt to beat him into the sky, construction of the balloon was wrapped in secrecy. It was sewn together behind closed doors at Thunder & Colt's facility in Longview, Texas. At the manufacturing facility, only a handful of the staff was aware of what the planned SkyQuest 5. Construction of the balloon began in early summer of 1993 by the time Dr. Bussey's first sanction window opened in November, the balloon was ready. Bussey and his crew, however, would sit and wait through two 90-day sanction windows, the second stretching into the spring of 1994 before it became obvious the attempt would have to wait for another winter. According to Bob Rice, winter was the only time of year that the appropriate weather patterns would be seen. 
Bussey obtained his basket from Thunder and Colt in the UK. It was a basket that had been built for some of Dr. Coy Foster’s early record attempts. It was cut apart, redesigned and welded together again. Constructed of aluminum tubing and padded with pipe insulation from the local hardware store, the "basket" was then wrapped with shrink wrap to provide "solid" sides. A single stock C-3 model burner, on loan from Mark Bowie of Greenwood, Mississippi, would provide the necessary flame and heat.
Driving all night, Bussey and the crew of Chase One arrived in Chanute around 10 a.m. Sunday morning. After settling into a motel, Bussey and crew selected a city park for the actual launch site and visited the local police department to advise the authorities about the odd preparations set to begin the next morning about 3 a.m. and they were discovered by the local newspaper.
Chanute was chosen as the launch site by Bob Rice during his Saturday evening call, based on the weather system he saw developing. Ross identified a track directly between Little Rock, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee, on to Tupelo, Mississippi, over Birmingham, Alabama and virtually straight toward Jacksonville, Florida. Ross' forecast was almost perfect except for a slight turn north at the end of the flight. His accuracy two days before the flight launched amazed many on the crew.
At the home base in Longview, Glen Moyer had begun the task of sending out a release advising media, supporters and others that SkyQuest 5 was staging for launch. At 11 p.m. Moyer moved into Bussey's balloonport - communication center for the duration of the flight. Moyer set up the computer and set the alarm for 2:45 a.m.
The team in Kansas awoke at 2:30 a.m. and were making preparations for launch within 30 minutes. By 3:00 a.m. the teams in Chanute and Longview were ready. As the launch team of Bruce Bussey, Steve Jones, Edwin Bumpass and Mike Crawford prepared and inflated the balloon, complete with more than 170 gallons of propane, Bill Bussey set about checking the GPS and barograph - two instruments vital to verification of the records. In Longview, Glen McCoy was leaving town in Chase Two, heading east on I-20. In Shreveport he would pick up David Bellew and continue on toward Greenwood, Mississippi, where he hoped to intercept the balloon. Two chase teams had been planned with the expectation that Chase One might have trouble staying with the balloon. The primary concern was the lack of major roads for Chase One to follow - not a lot of consideration was given to the snowstorm or Bussey’s 100+ mph speeds that proved so fast, Chase One ended up six hours behind the balloon. A third team was aerial and would chase the balloon in the sky. Launched later in the morning, the plane, piloted by Jim Herschend with Mike Mills, was the only chase able to remain with the balloon throughout the flight.
The balloon designer and engineer, Mark Broome, had told Bussey that the balloon should fly 8 hours for certain, probably would go ten hours, and might stretch to 12 hours. This information, coupled with Bussey's desire to be on the ground an hour before sunset, set a launch time between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m. SkyQuest lifted from the ground at precisely 4:24 a.m. without incident. A light snowfall marred the otherwise perfect beginning to the adventure. It was a snowfall that would play a major role in the chase as the launch team, now Chase One, packed up and went off in chase of the balloon. They found themselves driving through a blowing snowstorm for the next 8 hours. Near Tupelo, Mississippi, Chase One finally left the snowstorm behind them. Chase One would never catch up with Bussey as they had fallen behind by before two hours from launch had passed. They were now hopelessly behind after fighting the snow for 8 hours. 
Above the clouds and the storm, Dr. Bussey had been facing his own challenges with the weather. "Immediately after a launch the most critical was to keep the balloon climbing, slowly climbing," Bussey explained later. "At that point the balloon is at maximum gross weight and any type of descent could possibly go into an uncontrolled descent. So I’m watching the flame, being certain I don’t have a flame-out. I want the balloon climbing at all times at a reasonable rate (200 fpm) not a fast rate, but a reasonable rate because with all that fuel on board I’m flying a bomb."
It wasn’t long before Bussey faced his first obstacle. While attempting to climb to altitude Bussey encountered a strong inversion layer at about . The failure of one of Earthwinds' early attempts had been credited with an inversion layer. Failing to punch through the inversion, Earthwinds brushed a mountainside shortly after launch from Reno, Nevada.
"I had never dealt with an inversion layer that restricted my flight," says Bussey. "This was the first one that wouldn’t allow me to penetrate it. At first I thought I must have let off the burner. But as I made subsequent attempts each time I would be climbing at about 400 feet per minute, then I would see my variometer needle start to fall to where I was in level flight and then descending at 200 or 300 feet per minute and my burner had been on the entire time and the temperature would climb about 30 or 40 degrees. After doing this a few times I realized I was trying to punch through an inversion but the balloon just did not have enough lift."
Bussey decided to fly the balloon level until he burned off enough fuel to lighten the balloon and increase its lift. He was finally able to get through the inversion, and the balloon continued to climb at an easy rate. The decision to continue climbing was based on ground speed readouts from his GPS unit. In pre-flight planning, Bussey had set 50 mph as a minimum speed parameter he would accept for the flight. As he climbed to altitude the speed also increased from 40 to 50 then 60 mph and faster. At just over two hours into the flight Bussey had reached altitude and was cruising at 87 mph. Eventually his top speed would reach 108 mph, and the average speed for the entire flight would reach 80+ mph. At this rate Bussey knew he had beaten his old record after just six hours into the flight. From that point on the question was not if he would beat the record, but by how much?
While Bussey was above the snowstorm and enjoying his high ground speeds, the crews on the ground were wondering just where he was. The balloon was traveling so fast, he outran Chase One to the point that all radio contact with the balloon was lost. This happened about 7:30 a.m. It would be three long hours before communication with Bussey was restored. A serious complicating factor was that his aircraft radios were frozen, making it impossible for him to communicate with air traffic control at Memphis Center. The Longview communications center was discussing with Chase One whether the balloon might have been forced down by weather. At that exact moment Bussey was flying between Little Rock and Memphis, and all that could be seen on the weather radar was a huge snowstorm. Fortunately Bussey was well above this weather and outrunning it.
Chase Two with Glen McCoy and David Bellew was in Greenwood, Mississippi, by mid-morning. With assistance from Mark Bowie, they were able to maintain contact with Bussey for about an hour. After that they found themselves in the same situation as Chase One - left behind by the speeding SkyQuest 5. As Bussey flew over Birmingham, Alabama, he had no radio contact with his crews. At approximately 1:30 a.m. radio contact was briefly re-established as the balloon and Bussey were nearing Columbus, Georgia. This time it was a wrecker driver in Macon that Bussey was able to contact on the radio who relayed communications to Longview by telephone. Longview center would not hear from Bussey again until he was on the ground.
Bussey, meanwhile, was enjoying a rare view from a balloon. He could see both the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico at the same time. In Longview, things were not so "pretty". Concerned that neither chase team would be able to make up the hours and catch the balloon (and not aware the chase plane was with the balloon) it was decided to roll a third ground chase team. Duane Clark of Taylors, South Carolina had agreed to assist. About noon Clark set off south into Georgia. 
The track forecast by Bob Rice for the flight remained consistent, and the Longview center and Chase One, Two and now Three anticipated a landing in a little triangle of southeast Georgia/northeast Florida bounded by Valdosta, Waycross and Jacksonville. Duane Clark, however, had collected weather reports from the area, and based on low-level and surface winds, Clark was certain Bussey would turn north once he descended to land and would be landing near Savannah. As communication director for the flight, Glen Moyer's job was to coordinate the chase crews, and after such a long flight, Moyer wanted someone there with him as soon as he touched down. Hindsight being 20/20, Moyer should have listened to Clark because he called the landing site almost exactly.
With Clark driving south out of South Carolina and Chase One and Two still hours behind, Bussey suffered the only real scare of the flight. "I could see Jacksonville and knew it was getting close to time to begin my descent. I could also see a cloud line running off to the northeast and my mind told me this was the shoreline," Bussey said later. "Upon a second look I realized that cloudline was about 100 miles offshore and the actual shoreline looked as if it was directly below me!"
Bussey immediately put the balloon into a terminal descent but the balloon would only fall at about 700 feet per minute. Concerned this would not get him down in time, he opened the valve again and finally achieved a descent rate of near 1,000 fpm. 
"I took it right down to the trees," says Bussey, "and these were probably 50 foot tall pine trees, and the wind was blowing about 10-12 and gusting. The balloon was very light and had no internal pressure so it was hard getting the balloon to settle down. I flew probably five miles over nothing but solid woods. I wasn’t worried about getting the balloon down, but I was worried that I might damage the balloon. So I said to myself I should take it all the way to the shoreline, then I thought better of it and decided I had the record, the thing to do was get down, be safe and get it over with."
It was 3:43 p.m. when the phone rang at Longview center, "Glen, this is Bussey. I’m down and safe. Let me tell you where I am." Bussey had landed about south of Savannah just across Highway 17, the old coast highway. Jim Herschend and Mike Mills in the chase plane watched and photographed the near stand-up landing, then landed their plane and were with Bussey about 30 minutes later. Duane Clark arrived less than an hour after touchdown. Chase Two was about four hours away and Chase One was still six hours behind. The flight had lasted eleven hours and nineteen minutes, covering , setting four world records for distance in AX-6, 7, 8 & 9 balloons and setting 10 US national records for distance in AX-6-15 balloons. Bussey still holds the world record for distance in AX-6 and AX-7 class balloons. 
The unfortunate news came when we realized the world record for AX-10-14 balloons was only . Bussey landed with more than 30 gallons of fuel left, enough for another 4–5 hours estimated flying time. Had he not run out of land, and an hour later out of daylight, there is little doubt he could have flown on to claim an additional 5 world records. A few more miles and this flight in a small balloon would have been longer than any other hot air balloon flight in the world, except for Lindstrand and Branson’s oceanic crossings. But the goal had been to beat one, his own AX-6 record set 8 years earlier; this he had clearly done.
In the aftermath of the flight, congratulations poured in from all around the world. However, none more impressive than a fax from Bob Rice, who called the flight one of the most impressive in modern history, quite a compliment from the man so closely associated with historic balloon flights such as the first Atlantic crossing by Double Eagle II and the first hot air balloon crossings of the Atlantic and Pacific. "What impressed me about the flight is that Bussey got so much out of so little. When you take a tiny balloon like this one and fly it for such a long distance, that’s phenomenal."
Rice also credited Bussey’s patience for waiting more than a year for the right weather system. Rice says patience is absolutely necessary for such record flights. "It’s fundamental," says Rice. "When you’re trying to do something that’s never been done before-which by definition is what a record flight is-you have to wait for the right weather. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with people who understand that."
So who deserves the credit, the weather man or the pilot? "Well," continued Rice, "it’s my choice of a weather pattern and the pilot’s decision to fly it!"
For Bussey the flight had two memorable moments. "The first was sunrise. It was dark and I was on top of the clouds and when that sun comes up it’s white and pretty and it starts warming up and is just beautiful. That, and when my GPS read 100 mph ground speed I was really excited, I knew then we had the record."

Dutch Hookbill

The Dutch Hookbill is a breed of domestic duck originating in the Netherlands. The name refers to the bird's distinctive Roman nosed beak. Called "Kromsnaveleend" in Dutch, the Hookbill is an old breed that can be traced back to the 17th century; it was traditionally raised alongside canals in its native country. 
Today, it is primarily raised for exhibition purposes, and is a seasonal egg layer of blue eggs. It is a light-weight bird, weighing between 5.5 and 6.5 pounds (2.3 to 2.8 kilos). The Hookbill appears in several varieties: the Dusky (or Dark) is in shades of gray-brown. The White-Bibbed version is similar to the Dusky, but has a large patch of white on the front and primary feathers. The last is an entirely white variety. Exported to North America in 2000, it has not yet been admitted to the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection.

Little Schuylkill Navigation, Railroad and Coal Company

The Little Schuylkill Navigation, Railroad and Coal Company (LSRR) was a railway company in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania in the 19th century. The main line ran from Port Clinton to Tamanend, for a total of .
History.
The railroad received a charter from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on February 28, 1826. Construction began in 1830; the tracks were constructed with strap iron on wood rails. The LSRR operated between Tamaqua and Port Clinton, at a junction with the Reading Railroad, beginning in 1831 with horse-drawn cars. Two steam locomotives were acquired by the railroad in 1833, but the wooden tracks did not support the engines. Iron "T" rails replaced the wooden ones in 1845, and the locomotives were then returned to regular service. It completed a junction with the Catawissa Railroad at Tamanend (also called Little Schuylkill Junction) in 1854.
In 1857 the LSRR built a roundhouse in Tamaqua, housing 21 locomotives and a turntable. In 1863 the company was leased by the Reading Railroad for 93 years. It formally merged with the Reading in 1952. - need primary source (ICC Valuation Reports?) -->

Bruce Crane

Robert Bruce Crane (1857 – October 30, 1937) was an American painter. He joined the Lyme Art Colony in the early 1900s. His most active period, though, came after 1920, when for more than a decade he did oil sketches of woods, meadows, and hills. He developed into a Tonalist painter under the influence of Jean Charles Cazin at Grez-sur-Loing. Crane’s mature works were nearly always fall and winter scenes. He usually painted in his studio in Bronxville, New York, where like many of the Tonalists he relied mostly on memories of his outdoor sketching experiences. Selected work can be found at the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme, Connecticut. He is a descendant of the Continental Congressman Stephen Crane.
Early artistic work.
Bruce Crane's father, Solomon Crane, was an amateur artist himself and interested his son in the New York art scene from a young age. However, it would be a summer trip to the Adirondacks that piqued Bruce's interest in painting after witnessing “a lot of young lady amateur (artists.)”. In hopes of starting a career in this field, he approached the famous artist Alexander Wyant and asked to start an apprenticeship with him. Wyant asked to see some of Crane's work, but Bruce did not believe that his skills were adequate enough to impress Wyant. Therefore, he declined the request and spent the next year improving his skills before he showed his work to Wyant and began to work with him. They remained friends until Wyant's death.
Fame.
Bruce Crane began to then study at New York's Arts Student League and in 1876 he was featured for the first time in an exhibit at the National academy of design, submitting his painting called "Old Swedish Church, Philadelphia". He soon began to paint locations of East Hampton and Long Island which would bring him praise and critical approval (as well as a steady income.) One unnamed critic stated: 
Crane had 1885 proved to the satisfaction of the art public that he handled one kind of landscape with as much ability as another. (His paintings) were treated as skillfully as his (his other works) with numerous variations of the leading motive of tone and color.
He then left New York to study in France with Jean Charles Cazin, a well known French painter of the 19th century. He experienced success there but things were about to change.
Family crisis.
Bruce Crane's first wife Jeanne Buchard Brainerd was institutionalized in an asylum, though it was never made clear if this was for an actual mental disease or a case of alcoholism, as Ann Crane (her daughter from a previous marriage)suggested. Jeanne began to publicly accuse Bruce Crane of adultery with his step-Daughter Ann but the case was dropped and the divorce finalized in 1902. Bruce would marry Ann Brainered two years later, despite a 25-year age gap. They would have a daughter, also named Ann.
Return to fame.
This period of time caused many critics to believe that he had lost his touch and his skills. Though it was his return to the Adirondacks that caused his work to mature as he began to focus on the basics of nature. 
In 1909 he won a bronze medal at the Carnegie Institute exhibition for his work "November Hills", showing that he was still a force to be reckoned with. Throughout the first two decades of the 20th century, Crane won at least 10 major national and international awards. This included the Inness Gold Medal (1901), Gold metal at the St. Louis Exposition (1904), The Saltus Medal (1912), and the silver medal at the Panama-Pacific Exhibition (1915). From 1929 to 1933, Bruce Crane was the President of the famed Salmagundi Club of New York City (founded 1871) and its artist of the year in 1902. He was also associated with the Grand Central Art Galleries, participating in its 1933 members' drawing. In 1897, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician, and became a full Academician in 1901.
Later life.
Crane grew frail after breaking both of his hips in a fall in 1935, nearly immobilizing him. He spent the remainder of his years in Bronxville before passing on October 29, 1937. Descendants of Bruce Crane can be found living in Virginia and California.

USS Yucca (IX-214)

The second USS "Yucca" (IX-214) was a tanker that served in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1946.
"Yucca" was constructed in 1920 by the Bethlehem Steel Company at Alameda, California, as the commercial tanker SS "Utacarbon". The U.S. Navy acquired her from the War Shipping Administration for World War II service in February 1945, renamed her "Yucca" on 9 March 1945, converted her to naval use at San Francisco, California, and placed her in commission as USS "Yucca" (IX-214) on 9 July 1945.
"Yucca" arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in late August 1945, just after the end of World War II, and departed that port on her way to duty in the Central Pacific on 3 September 1945. She stopped at Ulithi Atoll in the western Caroline Islands on 22 September 1945 but continued her voyage that same day, arriving at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 29 September 1945. She arrived in Nagoya, Japan on 6 October 1945, but returned to the Ryukyu Islands later that month.
On 11 November 1945, the tanker began her voyage back to the United States. Steaming via Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands and Pearl Harbor, she arrived in the Panama Canal Zone on 6 January 1946, transited the Panama Canal, and departed the canal's eastern terminus on 8 January 1946. She arrived in Mobile, Alabama, on 15 January 1946 and changed operational control to the Commandant, 8th Naval District, for inactivation preparations.
"Yucca" was decommissioned at Mobile on 19 February 1946 and returned to the War Shipping Administration for disposal. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 12 March 1946, and she was sold on 24 January 1947 to the Pinto Island Metals Company for scrapping.

Venomoid

A venomoid is a venomous snake that has undergone a surgical procedure to remove or inhibit the production of venom. This procedure has been used for venomous snakes, kept for pets or used in public demonstrations, to remove the risk of injury or death when handled. The removal of venom glands or fangs of exhibited animals may be by surgery or simple mutilation; some or all of these procedures have been considered illegal and unethical. Removal of fangs is uncommon, as snakes frequently regenerate teeth, and the more invasive procedure of removing the underlying maxillary bone would be fatal. Most venomoid procedures consist of either removing the venom gland itself, or severing the duct between the gland and the fang. However, the duct and gland have been known to regenerate, and supposedly "safe" snakes have killed mice and successfully envenomated humans. 
Advocates of this procedure state that it is done for safety reasons and have published methods for this surgery. However, this procedure is highly controversial amongst herpetologists, and is considered animal cruelty by many experts on venomous snakes, particularly in reference to this procedure being performed by unlicensed hobbyists with inadequate analgesia. For instance, a veterinarian review on reptile surgery published in 2006 stated that "such practices should be discouraged" due to both ethical and animal welfare concerns.
Legal questions have been raised about amateur venomoid surgeries, since the Australian 1986 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act states that animals must be anesthetized for the duration of an operation. In 2007 the Victoria state government amended the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986 to ban the removal of venom glands from snakes unless performed for a therapeutic reason by a registered veterinarian. In addition, a 2008 government tribunal ruled that venomoid snakes cannot be handled by members of the public, due to the risk of the venom glands regrowing.

Milu Yuan

The Milu Park, or Milu Yuan (), is a large public park located in southern Beijing, China named after its captive breeding herd of "milu" or Père David's Deer. It was once called the Nanyuan Garden or Nanhaizi Garden, which was the imperial hunting grounds for Ming and Qing emperors. The gardens, palaces, forests, rivers, marshes and grasslands used to be enclosed by wall
and gates. 
Milu Yuan is now a public park and an ecological research center that serves as a natural park for animals in Beijing. Among the attractions are the Père David's Deer or "milu" a deer that became extinct in China toward the end of the 19th century during the Qing Dynasty.

Scaloid

Scaloids are circular scales with visible "cut-up" stripes. True scaloid scales can only be found on the extinct Crossopterygians. The inner layer of the scale is made of lamellar bone. On top of this lies a layer of spongy or vascular bone and then a layer of dentinelike material called cosmine. The upper surface is keratin. The coelacanth has modified scaloid scales that lack cosmine and are thinner than true scaloid scales.

Dana Hall (musician)

Dana Hall (born March 13, 1969) is an American jazz drummer, percussionist, composer, bandleader, and ethnomusicologist. After spending the first few years of his life in Brooklyn, New York (his birthplace), he relocated with his family to his mother’s hometown of Philadelphia. There, Hall was exposed to jazz and soul music at an early age through the recordings of his mother Diane, his uncle Earl Harris, and his large extended family. His family’s interest in creative music, and their “open door” policy toward the finest resident Philadelphia jazz musicians of the modern era also served to create the perfect environment to spark Hall’s curiosity, passion, and ultimately his career, in music.
Biography.
Early life.
At the age of 12, Hall moved from Philadelphia to Voorhees Township, New Jersey and began studying drums under renowned drum instructor and educator Vincent “Jim” Hurley at Voorhees Middle School, followed by study with award-winning educator and bassoonist Dennis MacMullin at Eastern Regional High School in Voorhees Township. Hall also began playing the oboe in high school, an instrument he continued to play throughout college. Another notable Eastern High alumna is Kelly Ripa.
Hall attended Iowa State University and double majored in aerospace engineering and percussion. At ISU, Hall cultivated his interest in music, studying marimba and vibes, timpani, hand percussion, and drumset under Professors John Harris and Michael Geary.
Education and influences.
After completing his education in aerospace engineering at Iowa State University, Hall received his Bachelor of Music degree from William Paterson College in Wayne, New Jersey and his Masters degree in Composition and Arranging from DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois. He is presently a distinguished Special Trustees Fellow pursuing his Doctorate in Ethnomusicology at the University of Chicago.
As a jazz drummer, Hall is primarily influenced by the work of Art Blakey, Elvin Jones, ‘Philly’ Joe Jones, Max Roach, and Roy Haynes, with whom he shares a birth date. He is also directly influenced by the work of Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Ralph Peterson, Jr., and Kenny Washington, among many others.
As an ethnomusicologist, Hall is principally interested in issues of ethnicity, identity, and temporality; popular musics of the world; music as protest and resistance; and musics of both the African continent and the African Diaspora. His dissertation is a historical ethnography of Philly Soul during the Black Power Movement.
Career.
The list of exceptional artists that Hall has performed, toured, and/or recorded with directly reflects the diverse and varied approaches of his music-making in the fields of jazz and popular music and include Branford Marsalis, Ray Charles, Roy Hargrove, Joshua Redman, Horace Silver, Michael Brecker, Nicolas Payton, Kurt Elling, Benny Green, Frank Wess, Ken Peplowski, Wycliffe Gordon, Russell Malone, Frank Foster, George Coleman, Lin Holliday, Betty Carter, Jimmy Heath, Benny Golson, Bobby Hutcherson, Wallace Roney, Diana Krall, Harold Mabern, Renee Rosnes, Clark Terry, the Mingus Big Band, Steve Lacy, Muhal Richard Abrams, Jim Snidero, Eric Alexander, James Spaulding, Buster Williams, Gary Bartz, Dick Oatts, Melvin Rhyne, Ira Sullivan, David Murray, Bobby Broom, Lester Bowie, Slide Hampton, Charles Davis, James Moody, David Hazeltine, Henry Butler, Shirley Scott, Sonny Fortune, Joe Williams, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Billy Harper, Brian Lynch, Rick Margitza, Tim Hagans, John Swana, Ralph Bowen, Orrin Evans, Bud Shank, Phil Woods, Von Freeman, Ron Bridgewater, Kenny Barron, Maria Schneider, Jackie McLean, Mulgrew Miller, Marcus Belgrave, Hamiet Bluiett, the Woody Herman Orchestra, Patricia Barber, Joe Henderson, Curtis Fuller, Charles McPherson, Oliver Lake, and Steve Wilson, among others.

Škvorec

Škvorec is a market town situated in the Prague-East District, within Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic.
History.
Škvorec Castle is first mentioned in historical sources in 1279 (but more fully documented in 1404). The founder, and maybe the builder too, was probably Domaslav around 1279, an important courtier and landed official, the butler of the Queen (1262) and her food taster (1263–1269, 1279), Lord High Treasurer (1267–1278) and one of the ten Burgraves of the Prague Castle. From the castle he built, only the deep well is now preserved, cut in the granite rock, which was situated near to the early gothic palace - that standing on the site of the present school building.
The coat-of-arms of Domaslav of Škvorec (three vertical stripes), which can’t be found later in the Central Bohemia, proving that the castle must have passed to another noble family not long after . But unluckily the names of the owners until after 1450 are today not known.
In the second half of 14th century, the castle was owned by the Olbramovic family of Prague. One of them, Olbram son of Menhart (died around 1388), installed the priest of the church in Horky, which already belonged to Škvorec by 1354. Olbram son of Menhart was from 1356 the Reeve of Prague New Town and in 1373-1380 the Burgrave of Vyšehrad. In connection with Škvorec he is mentioned only two times: first as Olbram of Škvorec (in Skworzecz) in the records of visitation of the Prague archdeacon Pavel of Janovice from 1380, and as Olbram son of Menhart of Škvorec a document from 1385 (de Skworecz).
After his death, his three sons Olbram, Pavel and Václav became the owners of Škvorec. The most important of them was Olbram: in 1377 he started to study at the Faculty of Law of Prague University. In 1379 he became the canon of Prague and Vyšehrad. Between 1389-1396 he was the provost of St.Apolinar in Prague New Town, and also the chancellor of the king’s brother Jan of Zhořelec. On 31 January 1396, he became the Archbishop of Prague (he was installed by Pope Boniface IX.). His brother Pavel was a Burgrave in Týn nad Vltavou (1397), and Václav earned 500 marks of silver in the king’s service in 1396. These successes of the three brothers had an influence on their building activity at Škvorec, because its early gothic castle didn’t conform to the needs of noblemen at the end of 14th century.
According to the archeological, historical and building research made by architect Jan Žižka, it appears that round 1400 the family of Olbramovic essentially enlarged the area of the castle and added to the buildings. Opposite the old early-gothic palace they built an oblong tower with a pointed-arched gate and with a small wicket, together with drawbridges across the newly dug water-filled moat. Above it, east of the entrance tower, they built another gothic palace with a chapel, whose chaplain called Václav is noted in judgment roll of the Archbishopric of Prague in 1404. Due to the building of the new palace, Škvorec thus had two palaces, as was faithfully recorded in the "fideicommissum" documents in1654.
The archbishop with his two brothers owned Škvorec castle until 2 May 1402, when he died. His two surviving brothers then divided the property amongst themselves. Next, Jan Nichilen of Prague bought the Václav’s share (the rent from Škvorec Castle, half of the farmyard and some villages) in 1411, and before 1418 the owner of it was Jan of Klučov. The second half of property was still owned by Pavel of Škvorec until his death (after 1418).
His widow Eliška (Elisabeth) married before 1422 Jan Ohnništko of Ohnišťany, who appropriated the second half of the property too. But in 1426 he violated the parliamentary peace, when he killed his ex-neighbor Prokop Trčka of Květnice in a duel in Prague. As a result he was brought to court and then executed. Eliška became a widow again and very soon she had big debts. Because of them, she had to sell the rent from Škvorec, Hostyň and the half of the market-town of Úvaly to Prokop Bervík of Malešice in the same year. But he sold it only a short time after to Vilém of Kounic, from whom it was bought by Petřík Olbrámovic (shortly called Olbrámek), and thanks to this the whole property was again owned by the family of Olbramovic of Prague.
The next important owner of Škvorec castle was Čeněk of Klinštejn the Crown Prosecutor, who bought it from the Olbramovic family in 1462. He was a very significant person in the Bohemia of that time. He was not only the Crown Prosecutor, but also a Burgrave of Prague Castle (1451–1461) and of Vyšehrad (1467–1479) and in the years 1457-1481 he was the Queen's Prosecutor. In the time of his son Jan, in 1497, King Vladislav II. made Škvorec into a market-town. After his death round 1509, his brother Zdeněk inherited the Castle. He had many lawsuits with his neighbours, townsmen and also with his nearest relatives, as did his son Jindřich, who died in the battles against the Turks in Hungary. After that, the Castle passed to brother of Jindřich's mother - Zikmund Smiřický of Smiřice. In about 1545 he started reconstructing the old castle and modernised it into a renaissance seat. During this reconstruction he probably built the western range with arcades and the building on the eastern side of the courtyard.
During the inheritance procedure after his death, his sons divided the large family property so that Jaroslav became the owner of Škvorec, Albrecht received Náchod and Miletín and Jindřich got Hrubá Skála and Hořice. But not much earlier than 1560, Albrecht is also mentioned as the owner of Škvorec. His son Václav Jaroslav spent a long time in Škvorec, where he died in 1593. His son, Albrecht Václav, died in 1614 and the Castle was inherited by his uncle, Albrecht Jan.
As the "fideicommissum" records from 1618 tell, Albrecht Jan Smiřický of Smiřice had a vaulted hall known as “the stone hall”, lord’s apartment and also an armoury in the Castle. In other parts of the Castle there were the offices and rooms of members of his estate government and on the ground floor there was some economic establishment.
During the confiscation of his property in 1621 Škvorec Castle fell into the hands of Albrecht of Valdštejn, because his mother was from the Smiřický family. He sold it to Karel of Liechtenstein in 1623.
In the second half of the 17th century Jan Adam of Liechtenstein ordered his officials Šimon Karel Svoboda and Jan Kašpar Ouvalský to elaborate the urbary of his domain. So in 1677 The Golden Book (Zlatá kniha,), which was written in Czech, was finished.
The preserved records of the 'hejtman' of Černý Kostelec, Captain Přech Svatkovský of Dobrohošť, shows that the Swedes plundered the Castle and set it on fire on the 27 November 1639. During the fire the ceilings in some rooms in both palaces collapsed (in one of them – in the upper palace – was the jail for the retainers in that time). The repair works appear to have been minimal: until 1654 only the upper palace was covered by a temporary thatched roof and no more reconstruction then continued. So for the rest of 17th century the Castle was known as a ruin.
From the records of the Uhříněves Estate (to which Škvorec belonged at that time) it is known that the first part of the Castle was repaired by Kristian Minedi in 1710, when he submitted accounts for repairing six rooms to the Estate government. This northern part of the Castle became the seat of Princess Maria Theresa of Savoy, born of Liechtenstein (died 1772) after 1729. Škvorec Castle was still habitable in 1794, but in the years that followed it started to decay again. Instead of reconstruction, the Castle was largely dismantled in 1860-1884.
The dilapidated north-western range of the old Castle was demolished first, then the western two-storied wing was taken down in 1883.On the site of the ruin of the old gothic palace, the local school was built in 1890. Of the whole castle only the rebuilt baroque south-eastern part with the gatehouse tower was left - and also the old Castle well in the courtyard. The so-called 'New Castle' stands opposite the old one. It comprises a large baroque one-storey building with a courtyard of farm buildings, the remains of an old fountain and a baroque gate. As the plans of the architect Josef Jägr from the Liechtenstein family archive in Vaduz testify, this new part of Škvorec Castle was built soon after 1791.
Olbram of Škvorec.
Olbram of Škvorec was a nephew of the Prague archbishop Jan of Jenštejn. Jan of Jenštejn had to abdicate because of long-lasting arguments with the Bohemian King Wenceslaus IV, who occupied his lands in 1395. As a satisfaction, the archbishop sued out, that his successor on the archbishop seat would be his nephew Olbram of Škvorec.
The attacks against the Bohemian King Wenceslaus IV, led by many enemies from Bohemia but also abroad, caused that in 1401 the King Wenceslaus had to give the rule in Bohemia to the council of four noblemen: one of them was the archbishop of Prague Olbram of Škvorec. The council should reign in Bohemia instead of the King. Afterwards the King was even captured by his brother Zikmund in Vienna and his henchmen liberated him at the end of the year 1401. After that he took the rule in Bohemia again and the council was disbanded.
Olbram became the archbishop on 2 July 1396 and he was directed direct by the king Wenceslaus. He was installed by his uncle Jan of Jenštejn, for whom it was the last public appearance. Before he became archbishop, Olbram was a chancellor and private mentor of Jan Zhorelecký (the younger brother of King Wenceslaus). Since 1382 he was a canon by St. Vitus Cathedral and in 1389 he became a provost of a collegiate canonry of St. Apolinar (Apolinár).
He was very well-educated theologian and a big lover of fine arts. He was an expert in recognizing of man-characters. It was him who appealed to the King Wenceslaus, to take care of welfare of the Church and warned him against spread of heresy in Bohemia.
The arguments between the King Wenceslas and the Union of Lords lead to the establishment of conciliation commission in 1399. It had 8 members – 4 of the king’s side and 4 of the side of the Union of Lords. One of the members of the king’s side was Olbram. They should discuss and solve the problems in Bohemia.
Zikmund Smiřický of Smiřice.
Zikmund Smiřický was a Lutheran. On his estates in Eastern Bohemia, which included Hrubá Skála and Malá Skála, he had to control fierce disputes amongst the villages and manors which panned for gold and silver on the river Jizerka. The Smiřický family was for a time one of the wealthiest in the kingdom, with vast holdings in North Bohemia. Albrecht Jan ze Smirnic (born 1594) was Ambassador to the Court of the Emperor and personally participated in the Prague Defenestration. He cast his lot with Bedrich Faldsky and by the time of the Battle of the White Mountain he had died (1618) childless - ending his family line and all his property was confiscated in 1622. Škvorec and other estates of Albrecht Jan were gained by Albrecht of Wallenstein, whose mother was a Smiřický, as war booty from the Emperor.
Maria Theresia.
Maria Theresia (Anna Felicita), Princess von und zu Liechtenstein, was born on 11 May 1694. She was the heiress to the Dukedom of Troppau (Silesia) (now Opava in Moravia). Her father was Furst Johann Adam Ulrich von Liechtenstein - who had purchased the counties of Vaduz and Schellenberg, which is now the modern state of Liechtenstein (although the first Prince to visit Vaduz did so only in 1844). Her mother, Edmunda Marie Theresa von Dietrichstein was the great granddaughter of Adam von Dietrichstein (1527–1590), Hofmeister to the Court of Rudolf II and buried in St Vitus Cathedral, Prague Castle. Maria Theresia’s father had died in 1712 - and both her brothers before that.
In Vienna on 24 October 1713 Maria Theresia married Thomas Emmanuel, Compte de Soissons and Governor of Antwerp (born on 8 December 1687). By this marriage she also became Duchess of Savoy-Carignan. Carignano had been raised by Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy into a principality as an appanage for his third son, Thomas Francis (1596–1656). The house of Carignano developed two junior branches, those of Soissons and Villafranca. In 1662 the town of Yvois in the Ardennes was raised by Louis XIV into a duchy in his favour, its name being changed at the same time to Carignan. The famous Prince Eugene was the second son of the first Duke of Carignan.
Prince Eugene was Thomas Emmanuel’s uncle. Eugene served under Leopold 1st of Austria - and for his leadership at the battle for Vienna (against the Turks) in 1683 he became known as ‘The Atlas of the Austrian monarchy’. In 1697, as Field Marshal and chief of Austria’s armies, he defeated the forces of the Ottoman sultan, Mustafa II, at the decisive battle of Zenta in Hungary.
After her husband died in Vienna on 28 December 1729, Maria Therese made Škvorec Castle her seat.
On 20 February 1772 Maria Theresia died in Vienna. She was a descendant of Georg Hartmann who had become Lutheran c. 1540, while her great grandfather, Karl, a Stattholder of Bohemia had found it wise to become a Catholic in 1599. Maria Theresa’s son, Eugene Jean Francois, Compte de Soissons and Duke of Troppau (born 23 September 1714; died at Mannheim on 24 November 1734) had died at only 20 years old, thus her estate passed to Franz Joseph I, Prince of Liechtenstein - great grandson of Furst Hartmann von Liechtenstein (1613–1686). The title of Compte de Soissons became extinct with the young son’s death.
On his deathbed, on 10 November 1734, Eugene had married by proxy Duchessa Maria Teresa di Massa, Principessa di Carrara - who was only 9 years old at the time. Her second marriage was to Ercole III Rinaldo d’Este, Duke of Modena and Reggio and a descendant of Lucrezia Borgia. Their daughter married Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, whose descendant was Archduke Ferdinand d’Este, heir to the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and who was murdered at Sarajevo in 1914.

Khorchin Mongols

The Khorchin (Хорчин, "Qorčin") is a subgroup of the Mongols that speak the Khorchin dialect of Mongolian and predominantly live in southeastern Inner Mongolia. 
The Ming Dynasty put two surrendered Borjigin princes (descended from Genghis Khan's brothers) over the Taining guard of the Three Guards which was established in 1389. During invasions of Esen Tayisi from 1446–48, most of them fled, however, Fuyu Guard of the Three Guards remained along the Nen River and Onon River. Ruled by descendants of Khasar, they became direct ancestors of the Khorchins. Adai Khan of the Khorchin challenged the power of the Four Oirats and the Ming court over the succession struggle of Northern Yuan Dynasty, however, he was killed by them in Ejene in 1438 and his tribe was forced to flee southward. The Khorchin appeared again in Mongolian chronicles with the rise of Unebolad wang in the late 15th century. The Khorchins allied with Dayan Khan and defeated the Uriyangkhai at the battle of Dalan Terqin in 1510.
In 1624, Nurhaci received the submission of Khorchins who roamed east of Khingan mountains and west of the Sungari. They were the first Mongol tribe that submitted to Qing Dynasty. The Khorchins were responsible for production of fermented mare's milk for Manchu emperors. The later emperors of the Manchu Qing Dynasty rewarded the Khorchin nobles highly for this early loyalty. Notable Empresses of the Qing Dynasty, such as Empress Xiaozhuangwen (1613–88) and Empress Xiaohuizhang (1641–1717), were the Khorchin-Borjigins. The Khorchins were further divided into two wings (north and south), each with 
three Banners. 
Due to the anti-Mongol rebellion among ethnic Han Jindandao followers in 1891, many thousands of Kharchin Mongols fled to the Khorchin. After 1900 both Chinese education and Chinese colonization spread among them. When the Japanese Empire occupied parts of Inner Mongolia and all of Manchuria in 1931, the Khorchins became the most energetic proponents of secular learning and reform among the Mongols. After World War II rural class struggle and the civil war of 1946–48 were very bloody and divisive. Since then they have been a powerful faction within Inner Mongolia's Chinese Communist Party apparatus.

<doc id="19798427" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19798427" title="Bedrock plane">
Bedrock plane

Bedrock is a design of bench planes developed by Stanley Works as an improvement over the Bailey plane design. It was introduced in the early 20th century. 
The main improvement of the Bedrock design was in the frog, which holds the blade also known as an iron. An issue with the Bailey design was that the frog was secured to the upper side of the sole, and the iron extended unsupported through a slot machined in the sole of the plane. This combined with the thin blade often led to "blade chatter" because the blade was able to flex, causing an uneven surface. The Bedrock design has a frog which extends through a much larger slot milled in the sole of the plane, providing support to the iron almost to its cutting edge. This combined with a better mounting of the frog to the plane body provided a more solid bedding of the iron to the plane body, hence the name "bedrock."
In addition to iron support, another problem with the Bailey design was that the frog mounting screws were under the iron, so the iron and the cap iron must be removed in order to adjust the position of the frog. This adjustment is necessary to vary the opening at the "mouth", which refers to the position of the iron in relation to the front of the slot in the sole, and which is used to control the size of shaving taken by the plane. The Bedrock design incorporated a new adjustment method, in which the entire frog could be wound forward or back, thus adjusting the mouth, without removing the blade.
A drawback of Bedrocks, shared with Baileys, is the thin iron, which were cheaper to produce and believed to be more easily sharpened.
Since the cheaper Baileys were kept in production along with the Bedrocks, to make the distinction easier, square designs were modelled in the body of the bedrock planes.
Long discontinued, Bedrocks are still sought after by both tool collectors and woodworkers. Some users prefer to fit thicker irons, which are available to suit most plane types but may require modifications to support the greater thickness behind the cap iron.

Palavir

The Palavir, an acronym for "Plugat HaAvir" (, "Air Companies") was the air force for the Palmach, based in Tel Aviv. Little is known about the Palmach's flying platoon due to its short life and its secrecy during the British Mandate. Like the rest of the Palmach it was made up entirely of Jewish fighters.
History.
In 1945, the "Palavir" was developed as Palmach's air division. The "Palavir" fell under the command of the unofficial Jewish defense force Haganah and operated prior to the establishment of the State of Israel. The Palmach's naval branch, Palyam, was also created in the same year. In 1943 the Palmach sent 3 of its fighters to be trained at the Jewish Agency owned flying school, Aviron flying school, in kibbutz Afikim. Later, the "Palavir" sent six more fighters. However, in 1943 the British outlawed the Haganah and Palmach. In response, the both organizations went underground. The "Palavir" disguised itself as an aeroclub called "Palestine Flying Club" and continued to train until 1947. The "Palavir" pilots also operated out of Ramla airport. In 1947, the "Palavir" and aeroclub were reorganized into the Sherut Avir which benefited from the return of Jewish soldiers who had been fighting in the Jewish Brigade of the British Army. In 1948 the Sherut Avir became the "Heil HaAvir" or Israeli Air Force. Also with the independence in 1948 the "Palestine Flying Club" was renamed the Israel Aero Club.
Contribution.
The 'Palavir' acquired its first aircraft, the de Havilland D.H.82C Tiger Moth in 1936 when the Yishuv leader, David Ben-Gurion, managed to purchase one from Britain. The plane's purchase was difficult due to resistance by the British government which feared that an independent Jewish force might encourage a similar Arab force. It was flown in by a British flight instructor named Grey and registered under the marks G-ACYN, with serial number 3314. Later, in 1947, two Tiger Moths from Canada were acquired as donations to a Jewish aeroclub. The same year, Aviron flying school moved out of Afikim and Ramla to Lod Airport. For the remainder of "Palavir"'s existence, it began to operate out of Haifa further north, enabling the Tiger Moths to photograph Syrian army camps in the Golan. The fact that the "Palavir" was created together with the Palmach and Palyam meant that it was born from the same soldiers and structure. Palmachniks would often interchange leadership positions between these branches. This culture continues in the IDF today, where the military's branches contrast the strict cultural divides that many militaries have developed (i.e. between the Navy and the Army). In Israel the IAF and the rest of the IDF are very much intertwined in history, culture, and operation.

Santa Rosa Jáuregui

Santa Rosa Jáuregui is a village in the Mexican state of Querétaro, seat of the homonymous borough of the municipality of Santiago de Querétaro. It has 16,966 inhabitants, and is located at 1950 meters above sea level. The borough is the largest of the municipality of Querétaro in terms of surface, covering its northern half, though it is the smallest in terms of population. There are fifty three rural and urban settlements, besides the village of Santa Rosa. 
If Santa Rosa were a municipality, it would be ranked 4th in the state in terms of population (after Querétaro, San Juan del Río, and Corregidora) and 14th in terms of area. It is considered the cradle of "carnitas" (deep fried pork meat).
Cityscape.
Federal Highway 57 crosses the borough in a north - south direction, as well as the Federal Road 111, which leads to San Miguel de Allende. The southern third is the urban nucleus, where the village of Santa Rosa and the suburb of Juriquilla are located, as well as the towns of Montenegro and La Solana. 39% of the population dwell here. This area has seen one of the most rapid growth rates in the state.
This area is close to the rest of the city of Querétaro, and the limits with the boroughs of Felix Osores and Epigmenio Gonzalez. Other than the presence of the Highway 57, the area benefits from the newly built Libramiento Sur - Poniente and the future Anillo Vial Junípero Serra, which will allow faster transportation to the rest of the city. 
Despite having half the population of Santa Rosa, Juriquilla is equal in land area and will expand greatly in the future. The area is home many public amenities: a golf course and a five star hotel, one of the most renowned bullfighting arenas in the country, a beautiful reservoir ("Presa del Cajón"), and four universities (campii of the UNAM, CINVESTAV - IPN, UAQ and UVM). This will make the area one of the science clusters in the State. 
New developments are being planned, notably the Omnicentro, which will include buildings by I.M. Pei. Department stores and a supermarket will also be built, attracting the middle class. 
North of Juriquilla is Santa Rosa, and separated by a small hill and the small reservoir "Presa de Dolores" which will become the Parque Bicentenario in the following months. This new park will make both settlements a cohesive urban area. Santa Rosa retains much of its rural village character, though most of its inhabitants have become blue collar workers in the city's industry. Thus, large housing projects are being developed.
Following the Highway 57 northwards, the "Presa de Santa Catarina" is the largest reservoir in the municipality, adjacent to Road 111, where the village of Buenavista is located. There have been many industrial parks built along the highway, notably the "Parque Industrial Querétaro", where companies such as Samsung are located. This area is projected to have an intensive industrial growth. 
The western part of the borough is hilly terrain that forms the limits with the State of Guanajuato. Nature has been preserved in the area, mainly through conservation areas such as the park of "Joya - La Barreta".
History.
The area is a perfect place for agricultural activities, and thus is home to four ancient haciendas, namely Juriquilla, La Solana, San Isidro and Santa María del Retablo. 
The village of Santa Rosa has its origins in the 17th century, when the first settlers paid rent for fifty years to the owner of the Hacienda of La Solana in order to occupy a small tract of land. 
On October 8, 1820, the "regidor" of Santa Rosa, Captain Antonio Ramón de Güemes, called elections to choose the 17 electors of the members of the first "Ayuntamiento", according to the Constitution of Cadiz. They were held on October 22, 1820, when the village had a population between seven and eight thousand people. On December 24, 1821 the second Ayuntamiento is elected, and on May 5, 1822, the mayor recognizes the independence of Mexico. The Constitutions of 1825, 1869 and 1879 recognize the settlement as a municipality. 
In June 1871, the Ayuntamiento asks Ignacio Timoteo Fernández de Jáuregui, owner of the Hacienda of Juriquilla, to sell some land to the municipality, but instead he decided to donate. This enabled the proper foundation of the village, and engineer Mariano Reyes drew the plans of the streets and squares of the new settlement. Hence, in September of that year, the surname of Jáuregui is added to the name of Santa Rosa. 
On January 7, 1914, Governor Teodoro Elizondo decrees that Querétaro shall be divided in 18 municipalities, and Santa Rosa becomes a borough of Querétaro. This would be ratified on August 31, 1916, by Governor Federico Montes. However, Governor Ramón Anaya signed Law 51 on May 20, 1931, that gave the status of municipality back to Santa Rosa. This law would be derogated on January 7, 1932 by Governor Saturnino Osornio, and this is the first official document where the village is referred to as "de Jáuregui".
The church of Santa Rosa de Lima was concluded during the Porfiriato, and the village remained a calm place, up to the development of the Provincia Juriquilla project.
Settlements.
Santa Rosa - Juriquilla Urban Nucleus
The southern end of the borough, 17 km north of the city of Querétaro, is considered its "urban nucleus". The village of Santa Rosa, and the smaller villages of Montenegro and La Solana on the east form the core of this area, together with the suburb of Juriquilla. This area will see rapid growth in the coming years. 
Rural Communities
There are 53 settlements in the borough, some of which are:

Space vector modulation

Space vector modulation (SVM) is an algorithm for the control of pulse width modulation (PWM). It is used for the creation of alternating current (AC) waveforms; most commonly to drive 3 phase AC powered motors at varying speeds from DC using multiple class-D amplifiers. There are various variations of SVM that result in different quality and computational requirements. One active area of development is in the reduction of total harmonic distortion (THD) created by the rapid switching inherent to these algorithms.
Principle.
A three phase inverter as shown to the right converts a DC supply, via a series of switches, to three output legs which could be connected to a three-phase motor.
The switches must be controlled so that at no time are both switches in the same leg turned on or else the DC supply would be shorted. This requirement may be met by the complementary operation of the switches within a leg. i.e. if A+ is on then A− is off and vice versa. This leads to eight possible switching vectors for the inverter, V0 through V7 with six active switching vectors and two zero vectors.
Note that looking down the columns for the active switching vectors V1-6, the output voltages vary as a pulsed sinusoid, with each leg offset by 120 degrees of phase angle.
To implement space vector modulation a reference signal Vref is sampled with a frequency fs (Ts = 1/fs). The reference signal may be generated from three separate phase references using the formula_1 transform. The reference vector is then synthesized using a combination of the two adjacent active switching vectors and one or both of the zero vectors. Various strategies of selecting the order of the vectors and which zero vector(s) to use exist. Strategy selection will affect the harmonic content and the switching losses.
More complicated SVM strategies for the unbalanced operation of four-leg three-phase inverters do exist. In these strategies the switching vectors define a 3D shape (a hexagonal prism in formula_1 coordinates or a dodecahedron in abc Three-Dimensional Space Vector Modulation in abc coordinates) rather than a 2D hexagon.

Mokelumne Wilderness

The Mokelumne Wilderness is a federally designated wilderness area located east of Sacramento, California. It is within the boundaries of three national forests: Stanislaus, Eldorado and Toiyabe. First protected under the Wilderness Act of 1964, the Mokelumne’s (pronounced "moo-ka-la-mi") borders were expanded under the California Wilderness Act of 1984 with the addition of 55,000 acres. The wilderness takes its name from the Mokelumne River, which was named after a Mi-wok Indian village located on the riverbank in California's Central Valley.
The wilderness encompasses an area of the Sierra Nevada mountain range between Ebbetts Pass to Carson Pass. There are two sections separated by the Blue Lakes Road and an Off-Road Vehicle corridor.
Elevations range from to . The highest point is Round Top (10,364 feet), a remnant volcano from which the wilderness area's volcanic soils are derived from and is located on the east side of the Sierra crest.
Landscape, flora and fauna.
The west slopes have been eroded by glaciation and water down to the granite bedrock which has created a dramatic contrast between the volcanic and the granitic landscapes.
The wilderness protects habitat for a great variety of plants and animals especially on the slopes of Round Top, which is designated a special interest area. Plants include Ponderosa pine, canyon live oak as well as alpine vegetation of Whitebark pine, subalpine fir, and western juniper, with western white pine, mountain hemlock, and lodgepole pine found in sheltered areas.
Waterways such as the North Fork of the Mokelumne River have riparian zones of white and mountain alder, creek dogwood, western azalea and bitter cherry.
Wildlife include the black bear and mule deer, as well as martin, bald eagle and the California spotted owl.
Areas of special interest.
The Round Top Botanical Area is at the junction of three botanical provinces and includes red fir forest, sagebrush scrub, subalpine and alpine environments. The combination of soil types, varying exposure and elevations produce diverse plant life, such as the phantom orchid ("Cephalanthera austiniae"), a rare plant that gets nutrients from dead material (saprophyte). The plant's common name is due to its color being all or mostly white.
The Round Top Geologic Area has more than within the wilderness and encompasses a variety of geological areas, including exposed granodiorite, lava flows, dikes, glacial moraines and cirques. The landform known as Elephants Back is a rounded mass of solidified lava. Mineralization produced gold-bearing quartz veins, and relics of past gold mining activities are still present in the area.
Recreation.
The Mokelumne Wilderness has a variety of recreational opportunities all year. With landscapes ranging from deep canyons to alpine heights and more than two hundred ice-scoured lakes and tarns, fishing and hiking are popular activities as well as cross country skiing. Access is from roads surrounding the wilderness boundary with Carson Pass being the most used entry point.
The Pacific Crest Trail, the Tahoe-Yosemite Trail and the Emigrant Summit Trail all cross through the Mokelumne Wilderness. The Emigrant Summit Trail is a designated National Recreation and Historic Trail that follows the western boundary and then passes through the wilderness from Emigrant Valley to Caples Lake.
Wilderness permits are required year-round for overnight visits.

Julia Morton

Julia Francis McHugh Morton (April 25, 1912 – September 10, 1996) was an American author and botanist. She was research professor of biology, and director of the Morton Collectanea at the University of Miami. She was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1974. Well known as a lecturer on toxic, edible and otherwise useful plants, she wrote 10 books and 94 scientific papers, and contributed to an additional 12 books and 27 papers.
Early life.
Morton was born Julia Francis McHugh, on April 25, 1912 in Middlebury, Vermont, and grew up on a farm in rural Vermont where she was interested in agriculture, the outdoors, and natural resources. At the age of 15, her mother and sister died, and she went to New York City to live with her brother. She worked as a commercial artist for several years and married Kendal Paul Morton (1897–1964), a Canadian. By 1933 they had begun work on collating information on food, medicinal, and other
useful plants. They assembled copies or clippings of existing material and filed it away in file cabinets. They housed this compilation in an office near the New York Public Library, and it soon became known as "The Morton Collectanea" in academia.
The war and the first publication.
When World War II started, the Mortons returned to Canada, where Kendal planned to enter military service and edit a military camp newspaper. However he failed his physical examination due to a heart murmur, and was exempted from service. Rather than remain in Canada or the US as civilians, the Mortons chose to move to the Bahamas. They placed most of the Collectanea in storage, but took entries on tropical fruits with them to Nassau, believing them likely to be useful. 
By consulting and adding to the files they brought with them to Nassau and by their studies of the plant life there, the Mortons prepared the manuscript and illustrations for their first publication, "Fifty Tropical Fruits of Nassau". Julia proved to be an excellent photographer and photographically illustrated nearly all of her subsequent publications. The book of 101 pages was published in 1946. A contemporary review in "Plant Physiology" characterized it as "well recommended by qualified botanists" and calling it "richly illustrated" and "quite complete" 
Life in Florida and further work.
After the war ended the Mortons were invited to work at the Subtropical Experimental Station in Homestead, Florida in association with George Ruehle and Dr. Bruce Ledin. Working with Ledin they produced the manuscript for the book "400 Plants of South Florida". Their work came to the attention of the president of the University of Miami, Bowman Foster Ashe, who offered them positions as professors at the Coral Gables campus.
President Ashe approved setting up the Collectanea at the new campus, and with the aid of professor Taylor Alexander, the files were installed in a new, more spacious location, and students employed to select and organize new material. This allowed the Collectanea to be expanded, and visiting scholars had room to work and free access to the material. By 1996 the Collectanea had grown to 500 file drawers and included approximately 15,000 species, but remained a manually collated and indexed resource. 
Although their initial work was on edible plants, their area of interest increased to cover poisonous plants as well as useful ones, both edible and ornamental. Additional books were published, and a suggestion that Julia's plant photographs were suitable for charts inspired the creation of two wall posters of "Plants Poisonous to People," one focusing on internally poisonous plants, and the other on skin and respirator irritants.
Kendal Morton died in 1964, according to her book "500 Plants of South Florida" 1974, but Julia continued their research and field work. Morton did research into use of plants in the treatment of cancer in the West Indies at the behest of the National Cancer Institute. She also did research into edible plants to aid in survival situations in the Philippines and Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, and wrote survival instructions for troops. Morton also conducted surveys of cashew and other edible nut plantations in Venezuela, Colombia and Peru.
Morton became known as an expert on plant poisonings and was often consulted by local authorities. She offered advice and worked to educate the public. Lawrence Kaplan, an emeritus professor of botany at the University of Massachusetts Boston and editor of the journal of the Society of Economic Botany, which Mrs. Morton helped found, said "She "was" the poison plant center in South Florida". Starting in 1954 when she began consulting for them, the Poison Control Center referred most plant poison calls to her. Although she received an honorary doctorate from Florida State University in 1973, she never formally attended college.
Morton continued to write, lecture, and answer inquiries at the Collectanea even after retiring. She retired from teaching in 1993, after being a University of Miami professor for about 4 decades. She was critically injured in an automobile accident on August 28, 1996 and died on September 10, 1996.

<doc id="19798753" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19798753" title="Correlation attack">
Correlation attack

In cryptography, correlation attacks are a class of known plaintext attacks for breaking stream ciphers whose keystream is generated by combining the output of several linear feedback shift registers (called LFSRs for the rest of this article) using a Boolean function. Correlation attacks exploit a statistical weakness that arises from a poor choice of the Boolean function – it is possible to select a function which avoids correlation attacks, so this type of cipher is not inherently insecure. It is simply essential to consider susceptibility to correlation attacks when designing stream ciphers of this type.
Explanation.
Correlation attacks are possible when there is a significant correlation between the output state of one individual LFSR in the keystream generator and the output of the Boolean function that combines the output state of all of the LFSRs. Combined with partial knowledge of the keystream (which is easily derived from partial knowledge of the plaintext, as the two are simply XORed together), this allows an attacker to brute-force the key for that individual LFSR and the rest of the system separately. For instance, if, in a keystream generator in which four 8-bit LFSRs are combined to produce the keystream, and one of the registers is correlated to the Boolean function output, we may brute force it first and then the remaining three, for a total attack complexity of 28 + 224. Compared to the cost of launching a brute force attack on the entire system, with complexity 232, this represents an attack effort saving factor of just under 256, which is substantial. If a second register is correlated with the function, we may repeat this process and drop the attack complexity to 28 + 28 + 216 for an effort saving factor of just under 65028. In this sense, correlation attacks can be considered divide and conquer algorithms.
Example.
Breaking the Geffe generator.
Correlation attacks are perhaps best explained via example. We will consider the case of the so-called Geffe keystream generator. The Geffe generator consists of three LFSRs: LFSR-1, LFSR-2 and LFSR-3. If we denote the outputs of these registers by formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3, respectively, then the Boolean function that combines the three registers to provide the generator output is given by formula_4 (i.e. (formula_1 AND formula_2) XOR (NOT formula_1 AND formula_3)). There are 23 = 8 possible values for the outputs of the three registers, and the value of this combining function for each of them is show in the table below:
Let us consider the output of the third register, formula_3. The table above makes it clear that of the 8 possible outputs of formula_3. 6 of them are equal to the corresponding value of the generator output, formula_11, i.e. formula_12 in 75% of all possible cases. Thus we say that LFSR-3 is correlated with the generator. This is a weakness we may exploit as follows:
Suppose we intercept the ciphertext formula_13 of a plaintext formula_14 which has been encrypted by a stream cipher using a Geffe generator as its keystream generator, i.e. formula_15 for formula_16, where formula_17 is the output of LFSR-1 at time formula_18, etc. Suppose further that we know some part of the plaintext, e.g. we know formula_19, the first 32 bits of the plaintext (corresponding to 4 ASCII characters of text). This is not as improbable as it may seem: if we know the plaintext is a valid XML file, for instance, we know that the first 4 ASCII characters must be "<xml". Similar to this, many file formats or network protocols have standard headers or footers which can be guessed easily. Given the intercepted formula_20 and our known/guessed formula_19, we may easily find formula_22 for formula_23 by XORing the two together. We now know 32 consecutive bits of the generator output.
Now we may begin a brute force search of the space of possible keys (initial values) for LFSR-3 (assuming we know the tapped bits of LFSR-3, an assumption which is in line with Kerckhoffs' principle). For any given key in the keyspace, we may quickly generate the first 32 bits of LFSR-3's output and compare these to our recovered 32 bits of the entire generator's output. Because we have established earlier that there is a 75% correlation between the output of LFSR-3 and the generator, we know that if we have correctly guessed the key for LFSR-3, approximately 24 of the first 32 bits of LFSR-3 output will match up with the corresponding bits of generator output. If we have guessed incorrectly, we should expect roughly half, or 16, of the first 32 bits of these two sequences to match. Thus we may recover the key for LFSR-3 independently of the keys of LFSR-1 and LFSR-2. At this stage we have reduced the problem of brute forcing a system of 3 LFSRs to the problem of brute forcing a single LFSR and then a system of 2 LFSRs. The amount of effort saved here depends on the length of the LFSRs. For realistic values, it is a very substantial saving and can make brute force attacks very practical.
We do not need to stop here. Observe in the table above that formula_2 also agrees with the generator output 6 times out of 8, again a correlation of 75% correlation between formula_2 and the generator output. We may begin a brute force attack against LFSR-2 independently of the keys of LFSR-1 and LFSR-3, leaving only LFSR-1 unbroken. Thus, we are able to break the Geffe generator with as much effort as required to brute force 3 entirely independent LFSRs, meaning that the Geffe generator is a very weak generator and should never be used to generate stream cipher keystreams.
Note from the table above that formula_1 agrees with the generator output 4 times out of 8 - a 50% correlation. We cannot use this to brute force LFSR-1 independently of the others: the correct key will yield output which agrees with the generator output 50% of the time, but on average so will an incorrect key. This represents the ideal situation from a security perspective - the combining function formula_11 should be chosen so that the correlation between each variable and the combining function's output is as close as possible to 50%. In practice it may be difficult to find a function which achieves this without sacrificing other design criteria, e.g. period length, so a compromise may be necessary.
Clarifying the statistical nature of the attack.
While the above example illustrates well the relatively simple concepts behind correlation attacks, it perhaps simplifies the explanation of precisely how the brute forcing of individual LFSRs proceeds. We make the statement that incorrectly guessed keys will generate LFSR output which agrees with the generator output roughly 50% of the time, because given two random bit sequences of a given length, the probability of agreement between the sequences at any particular bit is 0.5. However, specific individual incorrect keys may well generate LFSR output which agrees with the generator output more or less often than exactly 50% of the time. This is particularly salient in the case of LFSRs whose correlation with the generator is not especially strong; for small enough correlations it is certainly not outside the realm of possibility that an incorrectly guessed key will also lead to LFSR output that agrees with the desired number of bits of the generator output. Thus we may not be able to find the key for that LFSR uniquely and with certainty. We may instead find a number of possible keys, although this is still a significant breach of the cipher's security. If we had, say, a megabyte of known plaintext, the situation would be substantially different. An incorrect key may generate LFSR output that agrees with more than 512 kilobytes of the generator output, but not likely to generate output that agrees with as much as 768 kilobytes of the generator output like a correctly guessed key would. As a rule, the weaker the correlation between an individual register and the generator output, the more known plaintext is required to find that register's key with a high degree of confidence. Readers with a background in probability theory should be able to see easily how to formalise this argument and obtain estimates of the length of known plaintext required for a given correlation using the binomial distribution.
Higher order correlations.
Definition.
The correlations which were exploited in the example attack on the Geffe generator are examples of what are called "first order correlations": they are correlations between the value of the generator output and an individual LFSR. It is possible to define higher order correlations in addition to these. For instance, it may be possible that while a given Boolean function has no strong correlations with any of the individual registers it combines, a significant correlation may exist between some Boolean function of two of the registers, e.g. formula_28. This would be an example of a "second order correlation". We can define "third order correlations" and so on in the obvious way.
Higher order correlation attacks can be more powerful than single order correlation attacks, however this effect is subject to a "law of limiting returns". The table below shows a measure of the computational cost for various attacks on a keystream generator consisting of eight 8-bit LFSRs combined by a single Boolean function. Understanding the calculation of cost is relatively straightforward: the leftmost term of the sum represents the size of the keyspace for the correlated generators, and the rightmost term represents the size of the keyspace for the remaining generators.
While higher order correlations lead to more powerful attacks, they are also more difficult to find, as the space of available Boolean functions to correlate against the generator output increases as the number of arguments to the function does.
Terminology.
A Boolean function formula_29 of "n" variables is said to be ""m"-th order correlation immune" or to have ""m"-th order correlation immunity" for some integer "m" if no significant correlation exists between the function's output and any Boolean function of "m" of its inputs. For example, a Boolean function which has no first order or second order correlations but which does have a third order correlation exhibits 2nd order correlation immunity. Obviously, higher correlation immunity makes a function more suitable for use in a keystream generator (although this is not the only thing which needs to be considered).
Siegenthaler showed that the correlation immunity "m" of a Boolean function of algebraic degree "d" of "n" variables satisfies "m" + "d" ≤ "n"; for a given set of input variables, this means that a high algebraic degree will restrict the maximum possible correlation immunity. Furthermore, if the function is balanced then "m" + "d" ≤ "n" − 1.
It follows that it is impossible for a function of "n" variables to be "n"-th order correlation immune. This also follows from the fact that any such function can be written using a Reed-Muller basis as a combination of XORs of the input functions.
Cipher design implications.
Given the possibly extreme severity of a correlation attack's impact on a stream cipher's security, it should be considered essential to test a candidate Boolean combination function for correlation immunity before deciding to use it in a stream cipher. However, it is important to note that high correlation immunity is a necessary but "not sufficient" condition for a Boolean function to be appropriate for use in a keystream generator. There are other issues to consider, e.g. whether or not the function is balanced - whether it outputs as many or roughly as many 1's as it does 0's when all possible inputs are considered.
Research has been conducted into methods for easily generating Boolean functions of a given size which are guaranteed to have at least some particular order of correlation immunity. This research has uncovered links between correlation immune Boolean functions and error correcting codes.

Celebrity Juice

Celebrity Juice is a British television comedy panel game on ITV2, broadcast since September 24, 2008. The show is written and presented by Keith Lemon, the alter-ego of comedian Leigh Francis.
Background.
The format for the series was first suggested in 2007, after the final series of Francis' popular Channel 4 sketch show "Bo' Selecta!". ITV2 approached Francis to create a show featuring popular alter-ego Keith Lemon, and after the success of the five-part series "Keith Lemon's Very Brilliant World Tour", the channel commissioned "Celebrity Juice". The original premise of the show was to see which team knows most about the week's tabloid news stories, although later series focus more on the comedy factor of the participating celebrity guests and games involving them, rather than discussing the week's news.
Panelists.
The show's regular team captains are Holly Willoughby and Fearne Cotton. Occasionally, guest captains will fill in for Willoughby or Cotton when they are absent for personal reasons, with Emma Bunton, Chris Moyles and Jonathan Ross being the most notable guest captains. For the ninth series Kelly Brook replaced Fearne Cotton while she was on maternity leave. The show also features a regular comedic pannelist, who usually appears on Fearne's, or Kelly's, team. Having appeared during the first series twice, Rufus Hound became a regular panelist on Cotton's team from the second series onwards, although he left the show during the seventh series for undisclosed reasons. From the eighth series onwards, Chris Ramsey took up a semi-regular role on Cotton or Brook's team to replace Hound, although he only makes around three regular appearances per series. Lemon is also renowned for mocking both team captains, often referring to Willoughby as "Holly Willoughbooby" and mocking Cotton for her large nostrils and small breasts, also having given her the nickname "Dot Cotton". During the ninth series, he also often referenced the fact that Brook was sacked from several of her previous television projects.
As well as several guest pannellists who have appeared regularly on the show, the VT round, which features Lemon taking on a particular celebrity in a pre-arranged challenge, also features regular guests, with Verne Troyer having appeared since series two, Jedward having appeared since series three, David Hasselhoff having appeared since series five, the cast of "Coronation Street" having appeared since series eight, and Rylan Clark having appeared since series nine. The first series featured The Bear from Bo' Selecta! in this role, interviewing mystery celebrity guests to allow the team captains or panellists to guess who he was talking about. In the cover stories round, which also features a celebrity guest, a particular category entitled "Doggy Style" also features, in which a bulldog appears dressed as a particular celebrity. A bulldog called Gary appeared until series eight, due to his death in 2012, and another bulldog called Spud has appearance since series eight, having replaced him.
Production.
"Celebrity Juice" is filmed at the Riverside Studios. For its first seven series, the show was produced by Talkback Thames, and it has been produced by Talkback since series eight. The show is produced by Dan Baldwin and Leon Wilson. In 2011, the series won the Best Entertainment Show Award at the TV Choice Awards and in 2012, it won an NTA for best comedy panel show and a BAFTA Award for the YouTube Audience Award.
Games.
The following is a list of rounds that have appeared in various series' of the show throughout its run.
Guest appearances.
The following have made more than one appearance on the show as a guest (to 20 February 2014):

Sir Walter Barttelot, 3rd Baronet

Sir Walter Balfour Barttelot, 3rd Baronet DSO (22 March 1880 – 23 October 1918) was of the Barttelot Baronetcy and grandson of Sir Walter Barttelot, 1st Baronet. The Barttelots are said to have come into England with William the Conqueror, and to have fixed their residence at a place called "At Ford", in the parish of Stopham Sussex.
Early life and military career.
Barttelot was born at The Manor, Sidmouth on 22 March 1880. He was educated at Fonthill, East Grinstead and Eton College.
He then attended Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, Dorsetshire Regiment on 6 December 1899. The regiment was stationed in South Africa, so he was involved throughout the Second Boer War, part of the time he was an Aide de Camp to General Talbot Coke, and he also served as a staff officer to Colonel Williams, who commanded a Mounted Infantry Column. He succeeded to the title of 3rd Baronet Barttelot, on 23 July 1900, after his father, Sir Walter George Barttelot, 2nd Baronet, was killed in action during the Boer War. He transferred to the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards on 12 February 1901, returning to the United Kingdom with them in October 1902. The 3rd baronet received the Queen's South Africa Medal with six clasps and the King's South Africa Medal with two. He married Gladys St. Aubyn Angove, daughter of William Collier Angove, on 17 November 1903.
He was promoted to lieutenant on 9 November 1903, and to captain on 18 May 1910. He served in Egypt from 1906 to 1908, and from 27 June 1911 he was Aide de camp, and from 12 August 1913 to 14 October 1914, Military Secretary to Lord Denman the Governor-General of Australia.
First World War.
With the outbreak of the First World War, Barttelot initially served in France with the 4th (Reserve) Battalion Coldstream Guards, from 12 August 1914, where he was wounded at the Battle of the Aisne and also awarded the French Croix de guerre. He was then appointed a General Staff Officer, Grade III on 11 February 1915 and was concerned with coastal defence around Portland, and served in the ill-fated Gallipoli Campaign from July 1915, where he was promoted major on 1 September 1915. He was appointed a Brigade Major on 11 January 1916, for the Mesopotamian campaign. He was appointed to the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 22 December 1916, and appointed GSO, Grade II from 11 September 1917. and was Military Attaché to Tehran from 17 March 1918 with temporary promotion to lieutenant-colonel whilst performing those duties. He was awarded a brevet promotion to lieutenant-colonel for his service in Mesopotamia on 3 June 1918, and was killed, (aged 38) on 23 October 1918 in Tehran, Persia and was buried in the Tehran War Cemetery. In addition to his DSO, he had also been Mentioned in Despatches four times.
He had come to know Gertrude Bell during his time in Tehran, and in a letter to her mother on 25 October 1918, she wrote:
Family.
Barttelot was survived by his wife and two sons. The eldest son, Sir Walter de Stopham Barttelot, 4th Baronet, was killed in action as a brigadier on 16 August 1944, in Normandy during Operation Overlord during the Second World War. Barttelot was commemorated with memorial services in Stopham Parish Church on 9 November 1918, and at Holy Trinity Brompton on 11 November. His widow remarried, to Commander N. W. Diggle CMG, Naval Attaché in Rome, on 30 April 1920.
Barttelot's brother, Lieutenant-Commander Nigel Kenneth Walter Barttelot had been killed in the early days of World War I, whilst commanding the destroyer HMS "Liberty" during the Battle of Heligoland Bight.
Legacy.
Barttelot Road, in Horsham West Sussex, takes its name from the family.

Tucker's Witch

"Tucker's Witch" is a 12-episode comedy-detective series that aired on CBS television from October 6, 1982, to November 10, 1982, and again sporadically from March 31 to June 9, 1983. It starred 34-year-old Tim Matheson and 31-year-old Catherine Hicks as a charming married couple, Rick and Amanda Tucker, who own and operate their private detective agency in Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles. Hicks replaced actress Kim Cattrall, who was in the pilot but was removed from the show after the movie "Porky's" came out and showed Cattrall's racy scene in the gym. In later rebroadcasts on the USA Network, the program was known as "The Good Witch of Laurel Canyon".
Catherine Hicks had previously been a soap opera actress on ABC's "Ryan's Hope", and received an Emmy nomination for her 1980 performance as Marilyn Monroe in an ABC biopic, and later known to audiences for her role as Annie Camden, the sympathetic, discerning wife of the minister Eric Camden, played by Stephen Collins, in the Warner Brothers family series "7th Heaven". Matheson starred earlier in Robert Young's "Window on Main Street" and two western series, NBC's "The Virginian" with James Drury and ABC's "The Quest" with Kurt Russell, and in various films, including "Animal House". He was also the voice of the Jonny Quest cartoon character.
"Tucker's Witch" aired at 10 p.m. Eastern on Wednesdays in its first run and proved unable to compete with ABC's "Dynasty" prime time soap opera starring John Forsythe, Joan Collins, and Linda Evans and with NBC's "Quincy, M.E." starring Jack Klugman. The program was switched to Thursday for the second half of its brief run.
The show was produced by Hill-Mandelker Films.
Episodes.
The series pilot, in which Art Hindle and Kim Cattrall played Rick and Amanda, was never broadcast.
Ted Danson played an elevator killer in the 1982 premiere episode during the same season he began playing bartender Sam Malone on "Cheers". The better known guest stars in "Tucker's Witch" included Barry Corbin, Simon Oakland, Ted Danson, Joe Penny, and Noble Willingham.

1991 Scottish Cup Final

The 1991 Scottish Cup Final was the 106th final of the Scottish Cup, Scottish football's most prestigious knockout association football competition. The match took place at Hampden Park on 18 May 1991 and was contested by Scottish Premier Division clubs Motherwell and Dundee United. It was both Motherwell's and Dundee United's 6th Scottish Cup Final and also the first time the clubs had met in a Scottish Cup Final. The match was dubbed the "family final", as the manager of both clubs were brothers, Tommy McLean and Jim McLean.
As Scottish Premier Division clubs, Motherwell and United both entered the competition in the third round. Neither club won all four of their ties at the first attempt, Dundee United requiring a replay to knock out Division Two club East Fife in the third round. United went on to defeat Division One clubs Airdrieonians and arch rivals Dundee before eliminating Tayside derby rivals St. Johnstone in the semi-finals. After winning against defending champions Aberdeen in the third round, Motherwell defeated Division One clubs Falkirk and Greenock Morton then the previous seasons runners-up, Celtic, in a replayed semi-final.
The match was both clubs' 6th appearance in the final. However, it was Motherwell's first appearance in 39 years whilst Dundee United had reached the final only three seasons beforehand. Motherwell had previously won only one final whilst Dundee United had lost on all previous final appearances. 
Motherwell won the match 4–3 after extra time was played. They took the lead when Iain Ferguson headed in just after 30 minutes had been played. In the second half, Dundee United equalized through Dave Bowman. Motherwell went back in front thanks to 18-year-old Phil O'Donnell and their lead was then extended to 3-1 by Ian Angus. However, two goals from United, one from John O'Neil and a last minute equaliser from Darren Jackson made the score 3–3, forcing the match into extra-time. Substitute Stevie Kirk scored a header in the first half of extra-time to conclude victory for Motherwell.
Route to the final.
Motherwell.
As a Scottish Premier Division club, Motherwell entered the competition in the third round. They were drawn against fellow Premier Division club Aberdeen who were also defending champions having won the 1990 Scottish Cup Final. The match was played at Aberdeen's home of Pittodrie Stadium with Motherwell winning 1–0. The fourth round draw paired the club with Division One club Falkirk resulting in a 4–2 win at Fir Park to progress to the quarter-finals. Another Division One club in the form of Greenock Morton was the club's opponent, with the two clubs playing out a 0–0 draw to force a replay at Cappielow. The replay ended in another draw at 1–1 and the game progressed to a penalty shootout with Motherwell winning 5–4. In the semi-finals Motherwell faced the previous season's runners-up, Celtic, at Hampden Park with the game ending in another 0–0 draw for the club. A week later in the replay, Motherwell triumphed in a 4–2 victory to progress to the Scottish Cup Final for the first time in 39 years since defeating Dundee in the 1952 Final.
Dundee United.
Dundee United, also a Premier Division club entered the competition in the third round. They were drawn against Division Two club East Fife who had progressed from the first round. The clubs played out a 1–1 draw at Bayview Park to force a replay at Tannadice Park. In the replayed match United emerged victorious in a 2–1 win. The fourth round draw saw Airdrieonians visit Tannadice, with the club losing 2–0. In the quarter-finals, United were drawn against arch rivals Dundee to set up a Dundee derby match at home. United won the tie 3–1 to progress to the semi-finals where they faced other rivals St. Johnstone from nearby Perth in a Tayside derby. Dundee United won the match 2–1 and booked a place in the final for the fifth time in the past ten years following appearances in the 1981, 1985, 1987 and 1988 finals.

Campbell Snipe

The Campbell Snipe or Campbell Island Snipe ("Coenocorypha aucklandica perseverance") is a rare subspecies of the Subantarctic Snipe, endemic to Campbell Island, a subantarctic island south of New Zealand in the Southern Ocean. It was not formally described until January 2010. The subspecific name alludes to the name of the sealing brig "Perseverance", captained by Frederick Hasselborough, that discovered Campbell Island in 1810, and which probably inadvertently introduced rats to the island when it was wrecked there in 1828.
History.
The existence of the Campbell Snipe was unknown until 1997 when, during a search for the Campbell Teal, there was the chance discovery of a small population on an almost inaccessible rock, Jacquemart Island. Thus there is not much information about it and it remains one of the least known birds in the world.
Snipe are extinct on the mainland of New Zealand but continue to survive on several subantarctic islands. A naturalist landed on Campbell island in 1840 and whilst there found no birds to be present: all endemic land birds had been destroyed by rats from shipwrecks in the area (in the mid-19th century). By 2001 the rats on Campbell Island had been eradicated (the largest eradication of rats as a conservation effort in the world) and it was hoped that the snipe would naturally return to their original home.
In 2006 BDG Synthesis funded a search effort on Campbell Island. Snipe expert Dr Colin Miskelly, and James Fraser with a snipe dog, surveyed the island for snipe to see if they had re-established on the main island. They also intended to acquire DNA for analysis and comparison with the extinct mainland species. The snipe had already re-established with a population of about 30 individuals. This news was greeted with relief as it was thought that the species would have to be re-introduced from Jacquemart Island through human intervention. However, no intervention has been necessary as the snipe are naturally repopulating the 11,000-hectare pest-free island.

Jane Vain and the Dark Matter

Jane Vain and the Dark Matter is an indie rock band formed in 2005 from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The band is fronted by Calgary native Jamie Fooks, and signed to Edmonton’s Rectangle Records. They describe their sound as indie electro-pop. The "Montreal Mirror" called their music “melancholy" and "macabre,” and Fooks has been compared to Emily Haines, Cat Power, and Fiona Apple. They released their first full length album, "Love Is Where the Smoke Is", in January 2008.
History.
5’2 Jamie Fooks (vocals, guitar, keyboards) was born and raised in Calgary. She attended Crescent Heights High School, the same school as musicians Tegan and Sara, Paul Brandt, and former Alberta premier Ralph Klein. She began writing songs in her late teens, in what she admits was a way to get in touch with emotions “left over from a reckless adolescence,” at a time in her life when she was feeling extremely isolated from people in her age group and looking to find a niche for herself. She began experimenting with recording software, teaching herself to sing, compose and write songs. After learning to record, she set out learning how to play her own songs. At this point she began performing live at open mic nights in Calgary accompanied by guitarist Dillon Whitfield, her future bandmate in Calgary indie band Raccoon. Their sets consisted of drum beats and bass (programmed on Fooks’s computer), Whitfield’s chaotic guitar playing, and Fooks on vocals. Fooks admits that the first nights ended in tears but with encouragement from Whitfield and her friends she was persuaded to continue performing. Later they were joined by a live rhythm section consisting of Shawn Dicey (of Ontario’s alternative country band Ox) on drums and Stewart Elton on bass., and eventually signed to Edmonton's Rectangle Records in 2007.
Fooks wrote, produced and recorded all the songs on the band's debut album. Described by her interviewers as modest and self-aware, Fooks cites Cat Power, whom she has been compared to, as a major musical influence. The highlight of her career to date was playing onstage with Power at the Sled Island music festival in 2007. She also credits Mark Hamilton, of Calgary’s Woodpigeon as a mentor and a major collaborator on the album. In July 2008, the group was nominated for two of XM Satellite Radio’s Verge Music Awards, Best Album and Best Artist. The band spent the entire summer of 2008 touring Canada.
Asked about the origin of the band's name, Fooks once explained: "Jane is my mother's name...vanity scares me...so does the dark... think it's about overcoming the things that scare me or make me feel sad," adding that "the dark matter thing just kind of popped out in a random conversation."
Fooks was in a relationship with Whitfield for some time, but currently resides in Montreal, Quebec, where Jane Vain opened a national tour in support of their second studio album, "Give Us Your Hands", on June 11, 2010.
Collaborators.
The band has been described a “revolving door” for musicians from the Calgary music scene. Whitfield, former member of Suicide Boys and the founder of Raccoon, joined in 2005. Other past and present members include Britt Proulx (also of Raccoon), Markus Lake (bass), Jared Larsen (solo artist), and Jzero Schuurman (of Alberta experimental/folk groups Psychic Pollution, and Lucid 44). Shawn Dicey (drums) of Ox and Rocketsmog, and Stewart Elton (bass) have also worked with the group.
Jane Vain and the Dark Matter’s first album, "Love Is Where the Smoke Is", features contributions by Calgary musicians Mark Hamilton (ukulele, banjo, guitar, vocals), Foon Yap (violin), Woodpigeon's Annalea Sordi (vocals), Jesse Locke of SIDS, and Matt Flegel of The Cape May.
Sound.
Jane Vain and The Dark Matter are often described as a "pop noir" group. The band describes Whitfield’s guitar playing as “haphazard” and Fooks’s experimentation with computerized sounds is evident in the electronic beats strung together with sparse piano arrangements. Her vocals are smoky and breathy and her lyrics explore the trials of being young and modern, and “pay homage to love’s violence.” Calgary magazine "FFWD" has said that Fooks channels “nervous energy and musical brilliance into a personal outpouring of epic swells, evasive melodies and frenetic force.” The "Montreal Mirror" describes their songs as being “arrangements of strings, synths, guitar, piano, percussion and electronic beats [that form an elegant but vibrant base for Fooks’s lovely vocals, and melancholy, even macabre little narratives.” Jane Vain assert that they are “aiming for anxious chaos, but achieving a careful clarity” in their music.

BrickCon

BrickCon (Formerly known as NorthWest BrickCon) is a LEGO convention and exhibition in North America. It is held annually for adult fans of LEGO and hobbyists in Seattle, Washington. BrickCon operates over four days, generally Thursday through Sunday, and is typically held the first weekend in October. The event brings together the fan community that has evolved as a result of the Internet and helps them explore and develop their LEGO hobby. BrickCon is not affiliated to the LEGO company. BrickCon is made up of two parts: the private convention and the public exhibition.
Private convention.
The private convention's main focus is to provide a venue for adult fans of LEGO to bring and display their own LEGO constructions. Activities at the convention include presentations, seminars, round-table discussions, contests, games, door prizes and many experiences unique to a LEGO Fan Convention. The full attendee receives a convention packet containing a personalized brick name badge, a program of activities, handouts and coupons.
Public exhibition.
The public exhibition's main focus is to invite LEGO fans of all ages of the general public to view hundreds of hobbyist-built creations and meet their creators. Visitors may watch the Mindstorms robot battles or Brickfilm (a LEGO themed movie), browse and shop at various LEGO vendors, or have their kids build something in the building zone.

Artemisia nova

Artemisia nova is a species of sagebrush, known by the common name black sagebrush. 
It is "one of the most common shrubs in the western United States".
Distribution.
The native range of "Artemisia nova" is from the Mojave Desert mountains in southern California and in the Great Basin of Nevada and Utah, north to Oregon, Idaho and Montana, east to Wyoming and Colorado, and south to Arizona and northwestern New Mexico. 
It grows in forest, woodland, and grassland habitats. 
Taxonomy.
Identification is sometimes difficult, because this species is similar in appearance to Little sagebrush, "Artemisia arbuscula", and it easily hybridizes with Big sagebrush, "Artemisia tridentata", when it grows in the same area, leading to intermediate forms. 
Also, "Artemisia nova" has two main morphological forms, a darker, easily recognized form, and a less common light gray-green colored variant which closely resembles other sagebrush species. 
Description.
In general, "Artemisia nova" is a small, erect shrub producing upright stems branched off a central trunklike base. It is usually no taller than 20 to 30 centimeters but it has been known to exceed 70 centimeters in height. 
The aromatic leaves are green, short, narrow, and sometimes toothed at the tip. This species can sometimes be distinguished from its similar-looking relatives by black-tipped glandular hairs on its leaves. 
The inflorescence bears clusters of flower heads lined with shiny, oily, yellow-green phyllaries with transparent tips. The fruit is a tiny achene up to a millimeter long. 
The plant reproduces from seed except in very rare occasions when it reproduces vegetatively by layering.

Leigh Richardson

Leigh Richardson was the leader of People's United Party in Belize from 1951–1956, and also the mayor of Belize City.
Biography.
Leigh Richardson was a leader in Belize's independence movement. He was imprisoned in 1951 along with Philip Goldson for charges of sedition brought against them by the British colonial authorities. He was co-founder of the Belize Billboard and held leadership positions in the People’s Committee.
Formation of the UDP.
Leigh Richardson was a founding member of the People’s United Party and was elected as its second leader. He led the PUP to their first major political victory in 1954. After breaking away from the PUP, along with Philip Goldson, Richardson formed the Honduran Independence Party, which later merged with the National Party to create the National Independence Party (NIP). The NIP along with the Liberal Party and the People’s Development Movement joined forces in 1973 for opposition politics in Belize (then called British Honduras) and became the United Democratic Party (UDP).
Honors.
On September 18, 2008, Leigh Richardson was formally recognized as a Belizean patriot and was conferred with the Order of Distinction during the Independence Celebrations.

Government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis

The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was a set of events and conditions that led to a financial crisis and subsequent recession that began in 2008. It was characterized by a rise in subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, and the resulting decline of securities backed by said mortgages. Several major financial institutions collapsed in September 2008, with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession.
Government housing policies, over-regulation, failed regulation and deregulation have all been claimed as causes of the crisis, along with many others. While the modern financial system evolved, regulation did not keep pace and became mismatched with the risks building in the economy. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) tasked with investigating the causes of the crisis reported in January 2011 that: "We had a 21st-century financial system with 19th-century safeguards."
Increasing home ownership has been the goal of several presidents including Roosevelt, Reagan, Clinton and George W. Bush. However, the FCIC wrote that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government affordable housing policies, and the Community Reinvestment Act were not primary causes of the crisis.
Failure to regulate the non-depository banking system (also called the shadow banking system) has also been blamed. The non-depository system grew to exceed the size of the regulated depository banking system, but the investment banks, insurers, hedge funds, and money market funds were not subject to the same regulations. Many of these institutions suffered the equivalent of a bank run, with the notable collapses of Lehman Brothers and AIG during September 2008 precipitating a financial crisis and subsequent recession.
The government also repealed or implemented several laws that limited the regulation of the banking industry, such as the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and implementation of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. The former allowed depository and investment banks to merge while the latter limited the regulation of financial derivatives.
"Note: A general discussion of the causes of the Subprime mortgage crisis is included in Subprime mortgage crisis, Causes and Causes of the 2007–2012 global financial crisis. This article focuses on a subset of causes related to affordable housing policies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and government regulation."
Legislative and regulatory overview.
Deregulation, excess regulation, and failed regulation by the federal government have all been blamed for the late-2000s (decade) subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
In general, conservatives have claimed that the financial crisis was caused by too much regulation aimed at increasing home ownership rates for lower income people. They have pointed to two policies in particular: the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977 (particularly as modified in the 1990s), which they claim pressured private banks to make risky loans, and HUD affordable housing goals for the government-sponsored enterprises ("GSEs") — Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — which they claim caused the GSEs to purchase risky loans, and led to a general breakdown in underwriting standards for all lending.
Liberals present data that suggest GSE loans were less risky and performed better than loans securitized by more lightly regulated Wall Street banks. They also suggest that CRA loans mandated by the government performed better than subprime loans that were purely market-driven. They also present data which suggests that financial firms that lobbied the government most aggressively also had the riskiest lending practices, and lobbied for relief from regulations that were limiting their ability to take greater risks. In testimony before Congress both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Alan Greenspan claimed failure in allowing the self-regulation of investment banks.
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission issued three concluding documents in January 2011: 1) The FCIC "conclusions" or report from the six Democratic Commissioners; 2) a "dissenting statement" from the three Republican Commissioners; and 3) a second "dissenting statement" from Commissioner Peter Wallison. Both the Democratic majority conclusions and Republican minority dissenting statement, representing the views of nine of the ten commissioners, concluded that government housing policies had little to do with the crisis. The majority report stated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac "were not a primary cause of the crisis" and that the Community Reinvestment Act "was not a significant factor in subprime lending or the crisis." The three Republican authors of their dissenting statement wrote: "Credit spreads declined not just for housing, but also for other asset classes like commercial real estate. This tells us to look to the credit bubble as an essential cause of the U.S. housing bubble. It also tells us that problems with U.S. housing policy or markets do not by themselves explain the U.S. housing bubble."
However, Commissioner Wallison's dissenting statement did place the blame squarely on government housing policies, which in his view contributed to an excessive number of high-risk mortgages: "...I believe that the sine qua non of the financial crisis was U.S. government housing policy, which led to the creation of 27 million subprime and other risky loans—half of all mortgages in the United States—which were ready to default as soon as the massive 1997-2007 housing bubble began
to deflate. If the U.S. government had not chosen this policy path—fostering the growth of a bubble of unprecedented size and an equally unprecedented number of weak and high risk residential mortgages—the great financial crisis of 2008 would never have occurred."
In a working paper released in late 2012, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the arbiters of the Business Cycle, presented "Did the Community Reinvestment Act Lead to Risky Lending?" The economists compared "the lending behavior of banks undergoing CRA exams within a given census tract in a given month (the treatment group) to the behavior of banks operating in the same census tract-month that did not face these exams (the control group). This comparison clearly indicates that adherence to the CRA led to riskier lending by banks." They concluded: "The evidence shows that around CRA examinations, when incentives to conform to CRA standards are particularly high, banks not only increase lending rates but also appear to originate loans that are markedly riskier.
Deregulation.
The FCIC placed significant blame for the crisis on deregulation, reporting: "We conclude widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision proved devastating to the stability of the nation’s financial markets. The sentries were not at their posts, in no small part due to the widely accepted faith in the self-correcting nature of the markets and the ability of financial institutions to effectively police themselves. More than 30 years of deregulation and reliance on self-regulation by financial institutions, championed by former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and others, supported by successive administrations and Congresses, and actively pushed by the powerful financial industry at every turn, had stripped away key safeguards, which could have helped avoid catastrophe. This approach had opened up gaps in oversight of critical areas with trillions of dollars at risk, such as the shadow banking system and over-the-counter derivatives markets. In addition, the government permitted financial firms to pick their preferred regulators in what became a race to the weakest supervisor."
Mortgage and banking regulation.
Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act of 1982.
In 1982, Congress passed the Alternative Mortgage Transactions Parity Act (AMTPA), which allowed non-federally chartered housing creditors to write adjustable-rate mortgages. Among the new mortgage loan types created and gaining in popularity in the early 1980s were adjustable-rate, option adjustable-rate, balloon-payment and interest-only mortgages. These new loan types are credited with replacing the long standing practice of banks making conventional fixed-rate, amortizing mortgages. Among the criticisms of banking industry deregulation that contributed to the savings and loan crisis was that Congress failed to enact regulations that would have prevented exploitations by these loan types. Subsequent widespread abuses of predatory lending occurred with the use of adjustable-rate mortgages. Approximately 90% of subprime mortgages issued in 2006 were adjustable-rate mortgages.
The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.
This legislation established an affordable housing loan purchase mandate for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that mandate was to be regulated by HUD. Initially, the 1992 legislation required that 30 percent or more of Fannie's and Freddie's loan purchases be related to affordable housing. However, HUD was given the power to set future requirements, and HUD soon increased the mandates. (See HUD Mandates, below.)
Repeal of the Glass Steagall Act.
The Glass–Steagall Act was enacted after the Great Depression. It separated commercial banks and investment banks, in part to avoid potential conflicts of interest between the lending activities of the former and rating activities of the latter. In 1999, President Bill Clinton signed into law the GOP sponsored Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed portions of the Glass-Steagall Act. Economist Joseph Stiglitz criticized the repeal of the Act. He called its repeal the "culmination of a $300 million lobbying effort by the banking and financial services industries...spearheaded in Congress by Senator Phil Gramm." He believes it contributed to this crisis because the risk-taking culture of investment banking dominated the more conservative commercial banking culture, leading to increased levels of risk-taking and leverage during the boom period.
Economists Robert Kuttner and Paul Krugman have criticized the repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act as possibly contributing to the subprime meltdown, although other economists disagree. The vast majority of failures were either due to poorly performing mortgage loans, permissible under Glass-Steagall, or losses by institutions who did not engage in commercial banking and thus were never covered by the act. Its repeal aligned the formerly competing investment and commercial banking sectors to lobby in common cause for laws, regulations and reforms favoring the credit industry.
On the other hand, "Alice M. Rivlin, who served as a deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget under Bill Clinton, said that GLB was a necessary piece of legislation because the separation of investment and commercial banking 'wasn't working very well.'" Bill Clinton stated (in 2008): "I don't see that signing that bill had anything to do with the current crisis."
Capital requirements and risk classification.
Capital requirements refer to the amount of financial cushion that banks must maintain in the event their investments suffer losses. Depository banks will take deposits and purchase assets with them, assuming not all deposits will be called back by depositors. The riskier the assets the bank selects, the higher the capital requirements to offset the risk. Depository banks were subject to extensive regulation and oversight prior to the crisis. Deposits are also guaranteed by the FDIC up to specific limits.
However, depository banks had moved sizable amounts of assets and liabilities off-balance sheet, via complex legal entities called special purpose vehicles. This allowed the banks to remove these amounts from the capital requirements computation, allowing them to take on more risk, but make higher profits during the pre-crisis boom period. When these off-balance sheet vehicles encountered difficulties beginning in 2007, many depository banks were required to cover their losses. Martin Wolf wrote in June 2009: "...an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade – the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself – was to find a way round regulation."
Unlike depository banks, investment banks borrow money from investors and invest it; they are not subject to the same oversight or capital requirements. Large investment banks at the center of the crisis in September 2008, such as Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, were not subject to the same capital requirements as depository banks (see the section on the shadow banking system below for more information). The ratio of debt to equity (a measure of the risk taken) rose significantly from 2003-2007 for the largest five investment banks, which had $4.1 trillion in debt by the end of 2007.
FDIC Chair Sheila Bair cautioned during 2007 against the more flexible risk management standards of the Basel II accord and lowering bank capital requirements generally: "There are strong reasons for believing that banks left to their own devices would maintain less capital—not more—than would be prudent. The fact is, banks do benefit from implicit and explicit government safety nets. Investing in a bank is perceived as a safe bet. Without proper capital regulation, banks can operate in the marketplace with little or no capital. And governments and deposit insurers end up holding the bag, bearing much of the risk and cost of failure. History shows this problem is very real … as we saw with the U.S. banking and S & L crisis in the late 1980s and 1990s. The final bill for inadequate capital regulation can be very heavy. In short, regulators can't leave capital decisions totally to the banks. We wouldn't be doing our jobs or serving the public interest if we did."
Boom and collapse of the shadow banking system.
The non-depository banking system grew to exceed the size of the regulated depository banking system. However, the investment banks, insurers, hedge funds, and money market funds within the non-depository system were not subject to the same regulations as the depository system, such as depositor insurance and bank capital restrictions. Many of these institutions suffered the equivalent of a bank run with the notable collapses of Lehman Brothers and AIG during September 2008 precipitating a financial crisis and subsequent recession.
The FCIC report explained how this evolving system remained ineffectively regulated: "In the early part of the 20th century, we erected a series of protections—the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort, federal deposit insurance, ample regulations—to provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued America’s banking system in the 19th century. Yet, over the past 30-plus years, we permitted the growth of a shadow banking system—opaque and laden with shortterm debt—that rivaled the size of the traditional banking system. Key components of the market—for example, the multitrillion-dollar repo lending market, off-balance-sheet entities, and the use of over-the-counter derivatives—were hidden from view, without the protections we had constructed to prevent financial meltdowns. We had a 21st-century financial system with 19th-century safeguards."
Significance of the parallel banking system.
In a June 2008 speech, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, then President and CEO of the NY Federal Reserve Bank, placed significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a "run" on the entities in the "parallel" banking system, also called the shadow banking system. These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets.
This meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. He described the significance of these entities: "In early 2007, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, in structured investment vehicles, in auction-rate preferred securities, tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes, had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2 trillion. Assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to $2.5 trillion. Assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly $1.8 trillion. The combined balance sheets of the then five major investment banks totaled $4 trillion. In comparison, the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the United States at that point were just over $6 trillion, and total assets of the entire banking system were about $10 trillion." He stated that the "combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles."
Run on the shadow banking system.
Economist Paul Krugman described the run on the shadow banking system as the "core of what happened" to cause the crisis. "As the shadow banking system expanded to rival or even surpass conventional banking in importance, politicians and government officials should have realized that they were re-creating the kind of financial vulnerability that made the Great Depression possible—and they should have responded by extending regulations and the financial safety net to cover these new institutions. Influential figures should have proclaimed a simple rule: anything that does what a bank does, anything that has to be rescued in crises the way banks are, should be regulated like a bank." He referred to this lack of controls as "malign neglect." Some researchers have suggested that competition between GSEs and the shadow banking system led to a deterioration in underwriting standards.
For example, investment bank Bear Stearns was required to replenish much of its funding in overnight markets, making the firm vulnerable to credit market disruptions. When concerns arose regarding its financial strength, its ability to secure funds in these short-term markets was compromised, leading to the equivalent of a bank run. Over four days, its available cash declined from $18 billion to $3 billion as investors pulled funding from the firm. It collapsed and was sold at a fire-sale price to bank JP Morgan Chase March 16, 2008.
American homeowners, consumers, and corporations owed roughly $25 trillion during 2008. American banks retained about $8 trillion of that total directly as traditional mortgage loans. Bondholders and other traditional lenders provided another $7 trillion. The remaining $10 trillion came from the securitization markets, meaning the parallel banking system. The securitization markets started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008. More than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds. In February 2009, Ben Bernanke stated that securitization markets remained effectively shut, with the exception of conforming mortgages, which could be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
"The Economist" reported in March 2010: "Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were non-banks that were crippled by a silent run among panicky overnight "repo" lenders, many of them money market funds uncertain about the quality of securitized collateral they were holding. Mass redemptions from these funds after Lehman's failure froze short-term funding for big firms."
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (also called FNMA and FHLMC) are government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that purchase mortgages, buy and sell mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and guarantee a large fraction of the mortgages in the U.S.
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) reported in 2011 that Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac "contributed to the crisis, but were not a primary cause."
The FCIC reported that:
[[File:Loan performance in Varous Mortgage-Market Segments.GIF|thumb|400px|
<br>*SUB refers to loans that were sold into private label securities labeled subprime by issuers
<br>*ALT refers to loans sold into private label Alt-a securitizations (not as risky as subprime loans)
<br>*FHA refers to loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration <br>(source: Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States, p. 218, figure 11.3)]]
The Commission found GSE loans had a delinquency rate of 6.2% in 2008 versus 28.3% for non-GSE or private label loans. Taking the roughly 25 million mortgages outstanding at the end of each year from 2006 through 2009 and subdividing them into 500+ subgroups according to characteristics like credit scores, down payment and mortgage size, mortgage purchaser/guaranteer, etc., the Commission found the average rate of serious delinquencies much lower among loans purchased or guaranteed by government sponsored organizations such as the FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, than among non-prime loans sold into "private label" securitization. (see "Loan Performance in Various Mortgage-Market Segments" chart)
The Commission found that GSE mortgage securities essentially maintained their value throughout the crisis and did not contribute to the significant financial firm losses that were central to the financial crisis. The GSEs participated in the expansion of subprime and other risky mortgages, but they followed rather than led Wall Street and other lenders into subprime lending.
Writing in January 2011, three of the four Republicans on the FCIC Commission though dissenting from other conclusions of the majority, also found Fannie, Freddie, (and the CRA) not culpable for the crisis. The three wrote: "Credit spreads declined not just for housing, but also for other asset classes like commercial real estate. This tells us to look to the credit bubble as an essential cause of the U.S. housing bubble. It also tells us that problems with U.S. housing policy or markets do not by themselves explain the U.S. housing bubble."
Wallison's Dissent.
In his lone dissent to the majority and minority opinions of the FCIC, Commissioner Peter J. Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) blamed U.S. housing policy, including the actions of Fannie & Freddie, primarily for the crisis, writing: "When the bubble began to deflate in mid-2007, the low quality and high risk loans engendered by government policies failed in unprecedented numbers. The effect of these defaults was exacerbated by the fact that few if any investors—including housing market analysts—understood at the time that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been acquiring large numbers of subprime and other high risk loans in order to meet HUD’s affordable housing goals." His dissent relied heavily on the research of fellow AEI member Edward Pinto, the former Chief Credit Officer of Fannie Mae. Pinto estimated that by early 2008 there were 27 million higher-risk, "non-traditional" mortgages (defined as subprime and Alt-A) outstanding valued at $4.6 trillion. Of these, Fannie & Freddie held or guaranteed 12 million mortgages valued at $1.8 trillion. Government entities held or guaranteed 19.2 million or $2.7 trillion of such mortgages total. As of January 2008, the total value of U.S. mortgage debt outstanding was $10.7 trillion.
Wallsion publicized his dissent and responded to critics in a number of articles and op-ed pieces, and New York Times Columnist Joe Nocera accuses him of "almost single-handedly" creating "the myth that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac caused the financial crisis".
Other debate about the role (if any) of Fannie and Freddie in creating the financial crisis.
Critics of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Critics contend that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac affected lending standards in many ways - ways that often had nothing to do with their direct loan purchases:
Aggressive promotion of easy automated underwriting standards.
In 1995 Fannie and Freddie introduced automated underwriting systems, designed to speed-up the underwriting process. These systems, which soon set underwriting standards for most of the industry (whether or not the loans were purchased by the GSEs) greatly relaxed the underwriting approval process. An independent study of about 1000 loans found that the same loans were 65 percent more likely to be approved by the automated processes versus the traditional processes. The GSE were aggressive in promoting the new, liberalized systems, and even required lenders to use them. In a paper written in January 2004, OFHEO described the process: "Once Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began to use scoring and automated underwriting in their internal business operations, it was not long before each Enterprise "required" the single-family lenders with which it does business to use such tools. The Enterprises did so by including the use of those technologies in the conforming guidelines for their seller/servicers." 
Aggressive promotion of easy collateral appraisal systems.
In the mid-1990s Fannie and Freddie also promoted Automated Valuation Systems (AVMs). Before long the two GSEs decided that, in many cases, on-site physical inspections were not needed. Rather, the AVM, which relied mostly on comparable sales data, would suffice. Some analysts believe that the use of AVMs, especially for properties in distressed neighborhoods, led to overvaluation of the collateral backing mortgage loans.
Promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers.
In 2001 some mainstream banks told the "Wall Street Journal" that Fannie and Freddie were promoting small, thinly capitalized mortgage brokers over regulated community banks. Fannie and Freddie accomplished this be distributing their automated underwriting systems to the brokers. The "Wall Street Journal" reported that the underwriting software was "made available to thousands of mortgage brokers" and made these "brokers and other small players a threat to larger banks." The theory was that "brokers armed with automated-underwriting software" could sell loans directly to F&F, thereby "cutting banks out of the loan-making business." At the peak of the housing boom there were about 75,000 small mortgage brokers across the United States, and it is believed that many of these accounted for the slip-shod and predatory loan practices that led to the subprime mortgage crisis.
Creation of the low-quality loan products offered by private lenders.
Many of the loan products sold by mortgage lenders, and criticized for their weak standards, were designed by Fannie or Freddie. For example, the "Affordable Gold 100" line of loans, designed by Freddie, required no down payment and no closing costs from the borrower. The closing costs could come from "a variety of sources, including a grant from a qualified institution, gift from a relative or an unsecured loan." 
Close relationship to loan aggregators.
Countrywide, a company reported to have financed 20 percent of all United States mortgages in 2006, had a close business relationship with Fannie Mae. This relationship is described in Chain of Blame by Muolo and Padilla: "Over the next 15 years in 1991 Countrywide and Fannie Mae – Mozilo and Johnson and then Mozilo and Franklin Raines, Johnson's successor – would be linked at the hip." "Depending on the year, up to 30 percent of Fannie's loans came from Countrywide, and Fannie was so grateful that it rewarded Countrywide with sweetheart purchase terms – better than those offered to real (solid and reputable) banks."
False reporting of subprime purchases.
Estimates of subprime loan purchases by Fannie and Freddie have ranged from zero to trillions of dollars. For example, in 2008 Economist Paul Krugman erroneously claimed that Fannie and Freddie "didn't do any subprime lending, because they can't; the definition of a subprime loan is precisely a loan that doesn't meet the requirement, imposed by law, that Fannie and Freddie buy only mortgages issued to borrowers who made substantial down payments and carefully documented their income." 
Economist Russell Roberts cited a June 2008 Washington Post article which stated that "2004 to 2006, the two [GSEs purchased $434 billion in securities backed by subprime loans, creating a market for more such lending." Furthermore, a 2004 HUD report admitted that while trading securities that were backed by subprime mortgages was something that the GSEs officially disavowed, they nevertheless participated in the market. Both Fannie and Freddie reported some of their subprime purchases in their annual reports for 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. However, the full extent of GSE subprime purchases was not known until after the financial crisis of 2007/08. In December 2011 the Securities and Exchange Commission charged 6 ex-executives of Fannie and Freddie with Securities Fraud, and the SEC alleged that their companies held, in reality, over $2 trillion in subprime loans as of June 2008 (a month before Krugman made his exonerating statement).
Estimates of the subprime loan and securities purchases of Fannie and Freddie.
Critics claim that the amount of subprime loans reported by the two GSEs are wildly understated. In an early estimate of GSE subprime purchases, Peter J. Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute and Calomiris estimated that the two GSEs held about $1 trillion of subprime as of August 2008. A subsequent estimate by Edward Pinto, a former Fannie Mae Executive, was about $1.8 trillion, spread among 12 million mortgages. That would be, by number, nearly half of all subprime loans outstanding in the United States. The highest estimate was produced by Wallison and Edward Pinto, based on amounts reported by the Securities and Exchange Commission in conjunction with its securities fraud case against former executives of Fannie and Freddie. Using the SEC information, Wallison and Pinto estimated that the two GSEs held over $2 trillion in substandard loans in 2008.
The discrepancies can be attributed to the estimate sources and methods. The lowest estimate (Krugman's) is simply based on what is legally allowable, without regard to what was actually done. Other low estimates are simply based on the amounts reported by Fannie and Freddie in their financial statements and other reporting. As noted by Alan Greenspan, the subprime reporting by the GSEs was understated, and this fact was not widely known until 2009: "The enormous size of purchases by the GSEs and Freddie in 2003-2004 was not revealed until Fannie Mae in September 2009 reclassified a large part of its securities portfolio of prime mortgages as subprime." 
The estimates of Wallison, Calomiris, and Pinto are based upon analysis of the specific characteristics of the loans. For example, Wallison and Calomiris used 5 factors which,they believe, indicate subprime lending. Those factors are negative loan amortization, interest-only payments, down-payments under 10 percent, low-documentation, and low FICO (credit) scores.
Cheerleading for subprime.
When Fannie or Freddie bought subprime loans they were taking a chance because, as noted by Paul Krugman, "a subprime loan is precisely a loan that doesn't meet the requirement, imposed by law, that Fannie and Freddie buy only mortgages issued to borrowers who made substantial down payments and carefully documented their income." As noted, the SEC has alleged that Fannie and Freddie both ignored the law with regard to the purchase of subprime loans. However, some loans were so clearly lacking in quality that Fannie and Freddie wouldn't take a chance on buying them. Nevertheless, the two GSEs promoted the subprime loans that they could not buy. For example: "In 1997, Matt Miller, a Director of Single-Family Affordable Lending at Freddie Mac, addressed private lenders at an Affordable Housing Symposium. He said that Freddie could usually find a way to buy and securitize their affordable housing loans 'through the use of Loan Prospector research and creative credit enhancements … (emphasis added).' Then, Mr. Miller added: 'But what can you do if after all this analysis the product you are holding is not up to the standards of the conventional secondary market?' Matt Miller had a solution: Freddie would work with "several firms" in an effort to find buyers for these loans." .
The GSEs had a pioneering role in expanding the use of subprime loans: In 1999, Franklin Raines first put Fannie Mae into subprimes, following up on earlier Fannie Mae efforts in the 1990s, which reduced mortgage down payment requirements. At this time, subprimes represented a tiny fraction of the overall mortgage market. In 2003, after the use of subprimes had been greatly expanded, and numerous private lenders had begun issuing subprime loans as a competitive response to Fannie and Freddie, the GSE's still controlled nearly 50% of all subprime lending. From 2003 forward, private lenders increased their share of subprime lending, and later issued many of the riskiest loans. However, attempts to defend Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for their role in the crisis, by citing their declining market share in subprimes after 2003, ignore the fact that the GSE's had largely created this market, and even worked closely with some of the worst private lending offenders, such as Countrywide. In 2005, one out of every four loans purchased by Fannie Mae came from Countrywide. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac essentially paved the subprime highway, down which many others later followed.
Defenders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Economist Paul Krugman and Attorney David Min have argued that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) could not have been primary causes of the bubble/bust in residential real estate because there was a bubble of similar magnitude in commercial real estate in America — the market for hotels, shopping malls and office parks scarcely affected by affordable housing policies. Their assumption, implicitly, is that the financial crisis was caused by the bursting of a real estate "bubble."
Countering Krugman's analysis, Peter Wallison argues that the crisis was caused by the bursting of a real estate bubble that was "supported largely by low or no-down-payment loans," which was uniquely the case for U.S. "residential" housing loans. Also, after researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis, Xudong An and Anthony B. Sanders reported (in December 2010): "We find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in CMBS mortgage-backed securities loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis." Other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place "after" the crisis in residential real estate. Business journalist Kimberly Amadeo reports: "The first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006. Three years later, commercial real estate started feeling the effects. Denice A. Gierach, a real estate attorney and CPA, wrote:...most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a really bad economy. In other words, the borrowers did not cause the loans to go bad, it was the economy. 
In their book on the crisis, journalists McLean and Nocera argue that the GSEs (Fannie and Freddie) followed rather than led the private sector into subprime lending.
"In 2003, Fannie Mae's estimated market share for bonds backed by single-family housing was 45%. Just one year later, it dropped to 23.5%. As a 2005 internal presentation at Fannie Mae noted, with some alarm, `Private label volume surpassed Fannie Mae volume for the first time.` ... There was no question about why this was happening: the subprime mortgage originators were starting to dominate the market. They didn't need Fannie and Freddie to guarantee their loans ... As Fannie's market share dropped, the company's investors grew restless ...
<br>Citigroup had been hired to look at what Citi called `strategic alternatives to maximize long term ... shareholder value` Fannie Mae. Among its key recommendations for increasing ... market capitalization: ... begin guaranteeing `non-conforming residential mortgages`" 
"Non-conforming" loans meaning not conforming to prime lending standards.
In a 2008 article on Fannie Mae, the New York Times describes the company as responding to pressure rather than setting the pace in lending. By 2004, "competitors were snatching lucrative parts of its business. Congress was demanding that help steer more loans to low-income borrowers. Lenders were threatening to sell directly to Wall Street unless Fannie bought a bigger chunk of their riskiest loans"
Federal Reserve data found more than 84% of the subprime mortgages in 2006 coming from private-label institutions rather than Fannie and Freddie, and the share of subprime loans insured by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac decreasing as the bubble got bigger (from a high of insuring 48% to insuring 24% of all subprime loans in 2006). According to economists Jeff Madrick and Frank Partnoy, unlike Wall Street, the GSEs "never bought the far riskier collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that were also rated triple-A and were the main source of the financial crisis."
A 2011 study by the Fed using statistical comparisons of geographic regions which were and were not subject to GSE regulations, found "little evidence" that GSEs played a significant role in the subprime crisis.
Another argument against Wallison's thesis is that the numbers for subprime mortgages provided for him by Pinto are inflated and "don’t hold up". Krugman cited the work of economist Mike Konczal: "As Konczal says, all of this stuff relies on a form of three-card monte: you talk about “subprime and other high-risk” loans, lumping subprime with other loans that are not, it turns out, anywhere near as risky as actual subprime; then use this essentially fake aggregate to make it seem as if Fannie/Freddie were actually at the core of the problem." In Pinto's analysis, "non-traditional mortgages" include Alt-A mortgages, which are not used by low and moderate income borrowers and have nothing to do with meeting affordable housing goals.
According to Journalist McLean, "the theory that the GSEs are to blame for the crisis" is a "canard", that "has been thoroughly discredited, again and again."
The Commission met with Pinto to analyze his figures and, according to McLean, "Pinto’s numbers don’t hold up".
The Government Accountability Office estimated a far smaller number for subprime loans outstanding than Pinto. Pinto stated that, at the time the market collapsed, half of all U.S. mortgages — 27 million loans — were subprime. The GAO estimated (in 2010) that only 4.59 million such loans were outstanding by the end of 2009, and that from 2000 to 2007 only 14.5 million total nonprime loans were originated.
Pinto's data, included in Wallison's FCIC dissenting report estimated Fannie and Freddie purchased $1.8 trillion in subprime mortgages, spread among 12 million mortgages. However, according to journalist Joe Nocera, Pinto's mortgage numbers are "inflated", by classifying "just about anything that is not a 30-year-fixed mortgage as `subprime.`"
It must be noted that the judgments made above (by Konczal, Krugman, McLean, the GAO, and the Federal Reserve) were made prior to the SEC charging, in December 2011, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives with securities fraud. Significantly, the SEC alleged (and still maintains) that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported as subprime and substandard "less than 10 percent" of their actual subprime and substandard loans. In other words, the substandard loans held in the GSE portfolios may have been 10 times greater than originally reported. According to Wallison, that would make the SEC's estimate of GSE substandard loans higher than Edward Pinto's estimate.
According to David Min, a critic of Wallison at the Center for American Progress,
as of the second quarter of 2010, the delinquency rate on all Fannie and Freddie guaranteed loans was 5.9 percent. By contrast, the national average was 9.11 percent. The Fannie and Freddie Alt-A default rate is similarly much lower than the national default rate. The only possible explanation for this is that many of the loans being characterized by the S.E.C. and Wallison/Pinto as “subprime” are not, in fact, true subprime mortgages. 
Still another criticism of Wallison is that insofar as Fannie and Freddie contributed to the crisis, its own profit seeking and not government mandates for expanded homeownership are the cause. In December 2011, after the Securities and Exchange Commission charged 6 ex-executives of Fannie and Freddie with Securities Fraud, Wallison stated, as did the SEC, that the full extent of GSE subprime purchases was hidden during the crisis. Based upon the SEC charges, Wallison estimated that Fannie and Freddie held, in reality, over $2 trillion in subprime loans as of June 2008. However, journalist Joe Nocera contends that the "SEC complaint makes almost no mention of affordable housing mandates" and instead alleges the executives bought the subprime mortgages (in the words of Nocera) "belatedly ... to reclaim lost market share, and thus maximize their bonuses." According to Jeff Madrick and Frank Partnoy, what put Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship in September 2008 "had little to do with pursuit of the original goals of `affordable lending`. The GSEs were far more concerned to maximize their profits than to meet these goals; they were borrowing at low rates to buy high-paying mortgage securities once their accounting irregularities were behind them. ... Most disturbing about the GSEs, they refused to maintain adequate capital as a cushion against losses, despite demands from their own regulators that they do so."
Nocera's contention notwithstanding, at least one executive at Fannie Mae had an entirely different viewpoint, stating in an interview: Everybody understood that we were now buying loans that we would have previously rejected, and that the models were telling us that we were charging way too little, but our mandate was to stay relevant and to serve low-income borrowers. So that's what we did." Fannie and Freddie were both under political pressure to expand purchases of higher-risk affordable housing mortgage types, and under significant competitive pressure from large investment banks and mortgage lenders.
Wallison has cited "New York Times" columnist Gretchen Morgenson and her book "Reckless Endangerment" as demonstrating that "the Democratic political operative" Jim Johnson turned Fannie Mae "into a political machine that created and exploited the government housing policies that were central to the financial crisis and led the way for Wall Street". However, in a review of Morgenson's book, two economist critics of Wallison (Jeff Madrick and Frank Partnoy) point out Morgenson does not defend Wall Street as misled by Fannie, but states “of all the partners in the homeownership push, no industry contributed more to the corruption of the lending process than Wall Street.”
Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
By 2008, the GSE owned, either directly or through mortgage pools they sponsored, $5.1 trillion in residential mortgages, about half the amount outstanding. The GSE have always been highly leveraged, their net worth as of 30 June 2008 being a mere US$114 billion. When concerns arose regarding the ability of the GSE to make good on their nearly $5 trillion in guarantee and other obligations in September 2008, the U.S. government was forced to place the companies into a conservatorship, effectively nationalizing them at the taxpayers expense. Paul Krugman noted that an implicit guarantee of government support meant that "profits are privatized but losses are socialized," meaning that investors and management profited during the boom-period while taxpayers would take on the losses during a bailout.
Announcing the conservatorship on 7 September 2008, GSE regulator Jim Lockhart stated: "To promote stability in the secondary mortgage market and lower the cost of funding, the GSEs will modestly increase their MBS portfolios through the end of 2009. Then, to address systemic risk, in 2010 their portfolios will begin to be gradually reduced at the rate of 10 percent per year, largely through natural run off, eventually stabilizing at a lower, less risky size."
According to Jeff Madrick and Frank Partnoy, the GSEs ended up in conservatorship because of the sharpness of the drop in housing prices, and despite the fact that they "never took nearly the risks that the private market took." Jason Thomas and Robert Van Order argue that the downfall of the GSEs “was quick, primarily due to mortgages originated in 2006 and 2007. It … was mostly associated with purchases of risky-but-not-subprime mortgages and insufficient capital to cover the decline in property values.” In their paper on the GSEs they did "not find evidence that their crash was due much to government housing policy or that they had an essential role in the development of the subprime mortgage - backed securities market".
Community Reinvestment Act.
The CRA was originally enacted under President Jimmy Carter in 1977. The Act was set in place to encourage banks to halt the practice of lending discrimination. There is debate among economists regarding the effect of the CRA, with detractors claiming it encourages lending to uncreditworthy consumers and defenders claiming a thirty-year history of lending without increased risk.
Conclusions of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (majority report) concluded in January 2011 that: "...the CRA was not a significant factor in subprime lending or the crisis. Many subprime lenders were not subject to the CRA. Research indicates only 6% of high-cost loans—a proxy for subprime loans—had any connection to the law. Loans made by CRA-regulated lenders in the neighborhoods in which they were required to lend were half as likely to default as similar loans made in the same neighborhoods by independent mortgage originators not subject to the law."
The three Republican authors of a dissenting report to the FCIC majority opinion wrote in January 2011: "Neither the Community Reinvestment Act nor removal of the Glass-Steagall firewall was a significant cause. The crisis can be explained without resorting to these factors." The three authors further explained: "Credit spreads declined not just for housing, but also for other asset classes like commercial real estate. This tells us to look to the credit bubble as an essential cause of the U.S. housing bubble. It also tells us that problems with U.S. housing policy or markets do not by themselves explain the U.S. housing bubble."
Debate about the role of CRA in the crisis.
Detractors assert that the early years of the CRA were relatively innocuous; however, amendments to CRA, made in the mid-1990s, increased the amount of home loans to unqualified low-income borrowers and, for the first time, allowed the securitization of CRA-regulated loans containing subprime mortgages. In the view of some critics, the weakened lending standards of CRA and other affordable housing programs, coupled with the Federal Reserve's low interest-rate policies after 2001, was a major cause of the financial crisis of 2007/08.
CPA Joseph Fried wrote that there is a paucity of CRA loan performance data, based on a response by only 34 of 500 banks surveyed. Nevertheless, estimates have been attempted. Edward Pinto, former Chief Credit Officer of Fannie Mae (1987–89) and Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, estimated that, at June 30, 2008, there were $1.56 trillion of outstanding CRA loans (or the equivalent). Of this amount, about $940 billion (about 6.7 million loans) was, according to Pinto, subprime.
Economist Paul Krugman notes the subprime boom "was overwhelmingly driven" by loan originators who were not subject to the Community Reinvestment Act.
One study, by a legal firm which counsels financial services entities on Community Reinvestment Act compliance, found that CRA-covered institutions were less likely to make subprime loans (only 20-25% of all subprime loans), and when they did the interest rates were lower. The banks were half as likely to resell the loans to other parties.
Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Sheila Bair have stated that the CRA was not to blame for the crisis. In a 2008 speech delivered to The New America Foundation conference, Bair remarked, "Let me ask you: where in the CRA does it say: make loans to people who can't afford to repay? No-where! And the fact is, the lending practices that are causing problems today were driven by a desire for market share and revenue growth ... pure and simple." Bair is literally correct: The CRA doesn't tell banks to make loans to those who can't pay. However, research suggests that many banks felt heavily pressured. For example, Bostic and Robinson found that lenders seem to view CRA agreements "as a form of insurance against the potentially large and unknown costs..." of lending violations.
Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner says the CRA isn't to blame for the subprime mess, "First, only a small portion of subprime mortgage originations are related to the CRA. Second, CRA-related loans appear to perform comparably to other types of subprime loans. Taken together… we believe that the available evidence runs counter to the contention that the CRA contributed in any substantive way to the current mortgage crisis," Kroszner said: "Only 6%of all the higher-priced loans were extended by CRA-covered lenders to lower-income borrowers or neighborhoods in their CRA assessment areas, the local geographies that are the primary focus for CRA evaluation purposes."
According to American Enterprise Institute fellow Edward Pinto, Bank of America reported in 2008 that its CRA portfolio, which constituted 7% of its owned residential mortgages, was responsible for 29 percent of its losses. He also charged that "approximately 50 percent of CRA loans for single-family residences ... characteristics that indicated high credit risk," yet, per the standards used by the various government agencies to evaluate CRA performance at the time, were not counted as "subprime" because borrower credit worthiness was not considered. However, economist Paul Krugman argues that Pinto's category of "other high-risk mortgages" incorrectly includes loans that were not high-risk, that instead were like traditional conforming mortgages. Additionally, another CRA critic concedes that "some of this CRA subprime lending might have taken place, even in the absence of CRA. For that reason, the direct impact of CRA on the volume of subprime lending is not certain."
James Kourlas points out that ”industry participants … were convinced that they could handle the new lending standards and make a profit. They were convinced that they could safely fund the massive expansion of housing credit. That they were wrong is not proof in and of itself that they were willing to sacrifice profits for altruistic ideals. That government started the ball rolling doesn’t fully explain why the industry took the ball and ran with it.”
Government "affordable homeownership" policies.
Overview.
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), Federal Reserve economists, business journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera, and several academic researchers have argued that government affordable housing policies were not the major cause of the financial crisis. They also argue that Community Reinvestment Act loans outperformed other "subprime" mortgages, and GSE mortgages performed better than private label securitizations.
According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, "based on the evidence and interviews with dozens of individuals involved" in HUD’s (Department of Housing and Urban Development) "affordable housing goals" for the GSEs, "we determined these goals only contributed marginally to Fannie’s and Freddie’s participation in "risky mortgages".
Economists Paul Krugman and David Min point out that the simultaneous growth of the residential, commercial real estate—and also consumer credit—pricing bubbles in the US and general financial crisis outside it, undermines the case that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, CRA, or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis, since affordable housing policies did not effect either US commercial real estate or non-US real estate. 
was no federal act driving banks to lend money for office parks and shopping malls; Fannie and Freddie weren’t in the CRE [commercial real estate loan business; yet 55 percent — 55 percent! — of commercial mortgages that will come due before 2014 are underwater.
Writing in January 2011, three of the four Republicans on the FCIC Commission also agreed that the concurrent commercial real estate boom showed that U.S. housing policies were not the sole cause of the real estate bubble:
"Credit spreads declined not just for housing, but also for other asset classes like commercial real estate. This tells us to look to the credit bubble as an essential cause of the U.S. housing bubble. It also tells us that problems with U.S. housing policy or markets do not by themselves explain the U.S. housing bubble."
Countering the analysis of Krugman and members of the FCIC, Peter Wallison argues that the crisis was caused by the bursting of a real estate bubble that was "supported largely by low or no-down-payment loans," which was uniquely the case for U.S. "residential" housing loans.
Krugman's analysis is also challenged by other analysis. After researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis, Xudong An and Anthony B. Sanders reported (in December 2010): "We find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in CMBS mortgage-backed securities loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis." Other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place "after" the crisis in residential real estate. Business journalist Kimberly Amadeo reports: "The first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006. Three years later, commercial real estate started feeling the effects. Denice A. Gierach, a real estate attorney and CPA, wrote:...most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a really bad economy. In other words, the borrowers did not cause the loans to go bad, it was the economy.
Critics of U.S. affordable housing policies have cited three aspects of governmental affordable housing policy as having contributed to the financial crisis: the Community Reinvestment Act, HUD-regulated affordable housing mandates imposed upon Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and HUD's direct efforts to promote affordable housing through state and local entities. Economist Thomas Sowell wrote in 2009: "Lax lending standards used to meet 'affordable housing' quotas were the key to the American mortgage crisis." Sowell described multiple instances of regulatory and executive pressure to expand home ownership through lower lending standards during the 1990s and 2000s.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
HUD mandates for affordable housing.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) loosened mortgage restrictions in the mid-1990s so first-time buyers could qualify for loans that they could never get before. In 1995, the GSE began receiving affordable housing credit for purchasing mortgage backed securities which included loans to low income borrowers. This resulted in the agencies purchasing subprime securities.
The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 established an affordable housing loan purchase mandate for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that mandate was to be regulated by HUD. Initially, the 1992 legislation required that 30 percent or more of Fannie's and Freddie's loan purchases be related to affordable housing. However, HUD was given the power to set future requirements. In 1995 HUD mandated that 40 percent of Fannie and Freddie's loan purchases would have to support affordable housing. In 1996, HUD directed Freddie and Fannie to provide at least 42% of their mortgage financing to borrowers with income below the median in their area. This target was increased to 50% in 2000 and 52% in 2005. Under the Bush Administration HUD continued to pressure Fannie and Freddie to increase affordable housing purchases – to as high as 56 percent by the year 2008. In addition, HUD required Freddie and Fannie to provide 12% of their portfolio to "special affordable" loans. Those are loans to borrowers with less than 60% of their area's median income. These targets increased over the years, with a 2008 target of 28%.
To satisfy these mandates, Fannie and Freddie announced low-income and minority loan commitments. In 1994 Fannie pledged $1 trillion of such loans, a pledge it fulfilled in 2000. In that year Fannie pledged to buy (from private lenders) an additional $2 trillion in low-income and minority loans, and Freddie matched that commitment with its own $2 trillion pledge. Thus, these government sponsored entities pledged to buy, from the private market, a total of $5 trillion in affordable housing loans.
Until relatively recently, "subprime" was praised by at least some members of the U.S. government. In a 2002 speech in the Housing Bureau for Senior's Conference, Edward Gramlich, a former Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, distinguished predatory lending from subprime lending: "In understanding the problem, it is particularly important to distinguish predatory lending from generally beneficial subprime lending… Subprime lending … refers to entirely appropriate and legal lending to borrowers who do not qualify for prime rates…." Mr. Gramlich also cited the importance of subprime lending to the government's afforable housing efforts: " Much of this increased housing lending can be attributed to the development of the subprime mortgage market…."
Joseph Fried, author of "Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch?" believes it was inevitable that the looser lending standards would became widespread: "…it was impossible to loosen underwriting standards for people with marginal credit while maintaining rigorous standards for people with good credit histories. Affordable housing policies led to a degrading of underwriting standards for loans of all sizes." 
HUD's "National Homeownership Strategy".
"The National Homeownership Strategy: Partners in the American Dream", was compiled in 1995 by Henry Cisneros, President Clinton's HUD Secretary. This 100-page document represented the viewpoints of HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, leaders of the housing industry, various banks, numerous activist organizations such as ACORN and La Raza, and representatives from several state and local governments." The strategy was not limited to the loan purchases of Fannie and Freddie, or to Community Reinvestment Act loans. "This was a broad, governmental plan for the entire lending industry, comprising '100 proposed action items,' ostensibly designed to 'generate up to 8 million additional homeowners' in America.
As part of the 1995 National Homeownership Strategy, HUD advocated greater involvment of state and local organizations in the promotion of affordable housing. In addition, it promoted the use of low or no-down payment loans and undisclosed second, unsecured loans to the borrower to pay their down payments (if any) and closing costs. This idea manifested itself in “silent second” loans that became extremely popular in several states such as California, and in scores of cities such as San Francisco. Using federal funds and their own funds, these states and cities offered borrowers loans that would defray the cost of the down payment. The loans were called “silent” because the primary lender was not supposed to know about them. A Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (affiliated with HUD) publicity sheet explicitly described the desired secrecy: “NRC affiliates hold the second mortgages. Instead of going to the family, the monthly voucher is paid to NRC affiliates. In this way the voucher is “invisible” to the traditional lender and the family (emphasis added).
HUD also praised Fannie and Freddie for their efforts to promote lending flexibility: "In recent years many mortgagees have increased underwriting flexibility. This increased flexibility is due, at least in part to … liberalized affordable housing underwriting criteria established by secondary market investors such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac." To illustrate the desirable flexibility the Strategy cited a Connecticut program that "allows for nontraditional employment histories, employment histories with gaps, short-term employment, and frequent job changes." 
Criticism of the HUD strategy and the resultant relaxation of standards was criticized by at least one research company years prior to the subprime mortgage crisis. In 2001, the independent research company, Graham Fisher & Company, stated: "While the underlying initiatives of the were broad in content, the main theme … was the relaxation of credit standards." Graham Fisher cited these specifics:
Government housing policies guaranteed home mortgages and/or promoting low or no down payment have been criticized by economist Henry Hazlitt as "inevitably" meaning "more bad loans than otherwise", wasting taxpayer money, " leading to "an oversupply of houses" bidding up[ the cost of housing. In "the long run, they do not increase national production but encourage malinvestment." These risks were realized as the housing bubble peaked in 2005-2006 and deflated thereafter, contributing to the crisis.
Role of the Federal Home Loan Banks.
The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) are less understood and discussed in the media. The FHLB provides loans to banks that are in turn backed by mortgages. Although they are one step removed from direct mortgage lending, some of the broader policy issues are similar between the FHLB and the other GSEs. According to Bloomberg, the FLHB is the largest U.S. borrower after the federal government. On January 8, 2009, Moody's said that only 4 of the 12 FHLBs may be able to maintain minimum required capital levels and the U.S. government may need to put some of them into conservatorship.
Policies of the Clinton Administration.
As noted, the National Homeownership Strategy, which advocated a general loosening of lending standards, at least with regard to affordable housing, was devised in 1995 by HUD under the Clinton Administration. During the rest of the Clinton Administration HUD set increasingly rigorous affordable housing loan requirements for Fannie and Freddie.
In 1995 the Clinton Administration made changes to the CRA. The changes were extensive and, in the opinion of critics, very destructive. Under the new rules, banks and thrifts were to be evaluated "based on the number and amount of loans issued within their assessment areas, the geographical distribution of those loans, the distribution of loans based on borrower characteristics, the number and amount of community development loans, and the amount of innovation and flexibility they used when approving loans." Some analysts maintain that these new rules pressured banks to make weak loans.
Policies of the Bush Administration.
President Bush advocated the "Ownership society." According to a "New York Times" article published in 2008, "he pushed hard to expand home ownership, especially among minorities, an initiative that dovetailed with his ambition to expand the Republican tent — and with the business interests of some of his biggest donors. But his housing policies and hands-off approach to regulation encouraged lax lending standards." .
There appears to be ample evidence that the Bush administration recognized both the risk of subprimes, and specifically the risks posed by the GSE's who had an implicit guarantee of government backing. For example, in 2003, the Bush administration, recognizing that the current regulators for Fannie and Freddie were inadequate, proposed that a new agency be created to regulate the GSE's. This new agency would have been tasked specifically with setting capital reserve requirements, (removing that authority from Congress), approving new lines business for the GSE's, and most importantly, evaluating the risk in their ballooning portfolios. It was in specific response to this regulatory effort that Barney Frank made his now infamous statement "These two entities -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- are not facing any kind of financial crisis, the more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing." Had this new regulatory agency been put in place in 2003, it likely would have uncovered the accounting fraud regarding executive bonuses which was occurring at that time at Fannie Mae. This accounting scandal would later force the resignation of Franklin Raines and others executives. This new agency may also have slowed or stopped the further movement of the entire mortgage industry into subprime loans by exposing the full extent of the risks then taken by Fannie and Freddie, who at this time, controlled nearly half of all subprime loans being issued.
Republican Mike Oxley, the former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has pointed out that the House of Representatives did in fact pass a law strengthening regulation of the GSEs (the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2005) but the Bush White House scuttled it. In Oxley's words, "All the hand wringing and bedwetting is going on without remembering how the House stepped up on this. What did we get from the White House? We got a one-finger salute."
Efforts to control GSE were thwarted by intense lobbying by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In April 2005, Secretary of the Treasury John Snow repeated call for GSE reform, saying "Events that have transpired since I testified before this Committee in 2003 reinforce concerns over the systemic risks posed by the GSEs and further highlight the need for real GSE reform to ensure that our housing finance system remains a strong and vibrant source of funding for expanding homeownership opportunities in America … Half-measures will only exacerbate the risks to our financial system." Then Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid rejected legislation saying " we cannot pass legislation that could limit Americans from owning homes and potentially harm our economy in the process." A 2005 Republican effort for comprehensive GSE reform was threatened with filibuster by Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT).
Role of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Some economists, such as John Taylor, have asserted that the Fed was responsible, or at least partially responsible, for the United States housing bubble which occurred prior to the 2007 recession. They claim that the Fed kept interest rates too low following the 2001 recession, The housing bubble then led to the credit crunch. Then-Chairman Alan Greenspan disputes this interpretation. He points out that the Fed's control over the long-term interest rates critics have in mind is only indirect. The Fed "did" raise the short term interest rate over which it has control (i.e. the federal funds rate), but the long term interest rate (which usually follows the former) did not increase.
The Federal Reserve's role as a supervisor and regulator has been criticized as being ineffective. Former U.S. Senator Chris Dodd, then-chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, remarked about the Fed's role in the present economic crisis, "We saw over the last number of years when they took on consumer protection responsibilities and the regulation of bank holding companies, it was an abysmal failure."
According to Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's ideologically opposition to government regulation was unmoved either by complaints by grassroots "housing advocates" about the damage to low income communities by predatory mortgage lending in the early 1990s, by the failure of market forces to prevent an early, smaller subprime bubble and bust in the late 1990s, or by appeals by Reserve board governor Edward Gramlich to take a more active role in policing the subprime business.
A related criticism is made by economist Raghuram Rajan (Governor of Reserve Bank of India) who in a book on the financial crisis also argues that the low interest rate policy of the Greenspan Fed both allowed and motivated investors to seek out risk investments offering higher returns, leading to the subprime crisis (as well as the Dot-com bubble). The underlying cause for the American economy's tendency to go "from bubble to bubble", according to Rajan, was the "economy’s weak safety nets” for the unemployed, which made “the US political system ... acutely sensitive to job growth" and prone to unsustainable monetary stimulation.
Enforcement of laws and regulations.
Many existing laws and regulations were not effectively enforced prior to the crisis. The SEC was criticized for relaxing investment bank oversight and requiring inadequate risk disclosures by banks. The FDIC allowed banks to shift large amounts of liabilities off-balance sheet, thereby circumventing depository banking capital requirements. The Federal Reserve was criticized for not properly monitoring the quality of mortgage originations. Once the crisis hit its critical stage in September 2008, the regulators did not consistently apply remedies available to them, thereby increasing uncertainty. A primary example was allowing the demise of investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008, despite the Fed and Treasury Department facilitating a rescue/merger for Bear-Stearns in March 2008 and the Merrill-Lynch merger with Bank of America in September 2008.
Journalist Gretchen Morgenson cites the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission as noting with disapproval that during the course of the housing boom from 2000 to 2006, the Federal Reserve "referred a grand total of three institutions to prosecutors for possible fair-lending violations in mortgages." The report also quotes a former fraud investigator in the savings-and-loan crisis — William K. Black — lamenting as “terrible” that the “FBI got virtually no assistance from the regulators, the banking regulators and the thrift regulators.”
SEC and the net capital rule.
During the investment banking crisis in 2008, some analysts blamed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its 2004 decision that, they claimed, allowed greater leverage. This leverage enabled investment banks to substantially increase the level of debt they were taking on, fueling the growth in mortgage-backed securities supporting subprime mortgages. Subsequent analysis brings these claims into question.
The critics note that the top five US investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage during the 2004–2007 time period (see diagram), which increased their vulnerability to the MBS losses. These five institutions reported over $4.1 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007, a figure roughly 30% the size of the U.S. economy. Three of the five either went bankrupt (Lehman Brothers) or were sold at fire-sale prices to other banks (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch) during 2008, creating instability in the global financial system. The remaining two converted to commercial bank models in order to qualify for Troubled Asset Relief Program funds (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley).
While the nominal 8% capital requirements (i.e., 12.5 to 1 leverage ratio) had not been changed by the regulatory authorities, risk-based weighing allowed capital requirements to be reduced for A rated securities and higher. This change, still more stringent than the international Basel accords, was motivated by the goal of keeping American banks competitive with European banks. The reduced capital requirements encouraged banks to hold the less risky A rated securities (according to rating agency standards) rather than the more risky higher-leveraged (i.e. embedded leverage) first-loss tranches. The reduction in capital reserves (and increased explicit leveraged) was accompanied by the reduction of risky lower rated securities that had higher internal leverage.
At least one prominent official within the SEC has rejected the notion that the 2004 SEC changes caused the banks to reduce their capital reserves. In an April 9, 2009 speech, Erik Sirri, then Director of the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets, stated "he Commission did not undo any leverage restrictions in 2004," nor did it intend to make a substantial reduction. Although the SEC rule changes provided flexibility that could be used by banks to minimize their capital balances, Sirri explained that this was not applicable in the case of the 5 banks in the Consolidated Supervised Entity (CSE) program. Those 5 entities used an alternative standard, and had done so for decades. Specifically, they calculated capital requirements as a percentage of customer receivables (and not on the basis of the investments they held). Under the standard in use, the emphasis was on their ability to meet customer-related obligations - not on overall bank financial stability."
Some argue that leverage ratios did not change as dramatically as claimed by critics. Consider, for example, this statement made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO): "In our prior work on Long-Term Capital Management (a hedge fund), we analyzed the assets-to-equity ratios of four of the five broker-dealer holding companies that later became CSEs and found that three had ratios equal to or greater than 28-to-1 at fiscal year-end 1998, which was higher than their ratios at fiscal year-end 2006 before the crisis began."
Erik Sirri, then Director of the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets, concluded: "Since August 2008, commenters in the press and elsewhere have suggested that the 2004 amendments … allowed these firms to increase their debt-to-capital ratios to unsafe levels well-above 12-to1, indeed to 33-to-1…. While this theme has been repeated often in the press and elsewhere, it lacks foundation in fact."
The SEC is also responsible for establishing financial disclosure rules. Critics have argued that disclosure throughout the crisis was ineffective, particularly regarding the health of financial institutions and the valuation of mortgage-backed securities. The SEC is investigating these claims.
Regulation of derivatives.
The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 exempted derivatives from regulation, supervision, trading on established exchanges, and capital reserve requirements for major participants. Concerns that counterparties to derivative deals would be unable to pay their obligations caused pervasive uncertainty during the crisis. Particularly relevant to the crisis are credit default swaps (CDS), a derivative in which Party A pays Party B what is essentially an insurance premium, in exchange for payment should Party C default on its obligations. Warren Buffett famously referred to derivatives as "financial weapons of mass destruction" in early 2003.
Like all swaps and other financial derivatives, CDS may either be used to hedge risks (specifically, to insure creditors against default) or to profit from speculation. Derivatives usage grew dramatically in the years preceding the crisis. The volume of CDS outstanding increased 100-fold from 1998 to 2008, with estimates of the debt covered by CDS contracts, as of November 2008, ranging from US$33 to $47 trillion. Total over-the-counter (OTC) derivative notional value rose to $683 trillion by June 2008, of which about 8% were CDS.
CDS are lightly regulated. As of 2008, there was no central clearing house to honor CDS in the event a party to a CDS proved unable to perform his obligations under the CDS contract. Required disclosure of CDS-related obligations has been criticized as inadequate. Insurance companies such as American International Group (AIG), MBIA, and Ambac faced ratings downgrades because widespread mortgage defaults increased their potential exposure to CDS losses. These firms had to obtain additional funds (capital) to offset this exposure. AIG's having CDSs insuring $440 billion of MBS resulted in its seeking and obtaining a Federal government bailout.
Like all swaps and other pure wagers, what one party loses under a CDS, the other party gains; CDSs merely reallocate existing wealth is, provided that the paying party can perform. Hence the question is which side of the CDS will have to pay and will it be able to do so. When investment bank Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in September 2008, there was much uncertainty as to which financial firms would be required to honor the CDS contracts on its $600 billion of bonds outstanding.
Economist Joseph Stiglitz summarized how credit default swaps contributed to the systemic meltdown: "With this complicated intertwining of bets of great magnitude, no one could be sure of the financial position of anyone else-or even of one's own position. Not surprisingly, the credit markets froze."
Former President Bill Clinton and former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated they did not properly regulate derivatives, including credit default swaps (CDS). A bill (the "Derivatives Markets Transparency and Accountability Act of 2009") (H.R. 977) was unsuccessfully introduced to further regulate the CDS market and establish a clearinghouse. This bill would provide the authority to suspend CDS trading under certain conditions.
Author Michael Lewis wrote that CDS and synthetic CDO derivatives enabled speculators to stack bets on the same mortgage bonds and CDO's. This is analogous to allowing many persons to buy insurance on the same house. Speculators that bought CDS insurance were betting that significant defaults would occur, while the sellers (such as AIG) bet they would not. A theoretically infinite amount could be wagered on the same housing-related securities, provided buyers and sellers of the CDS could be found. He referred to this as a "Doomsday Machine."
NY Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo argued in April 2009 for the regulation of CDS and capital requirements sufficient to support financial commitments made by institutions. "Credit default swaps are the rocket fuel that turned the subprime mortgage fire into a conflagration. They were the major cause of AIG's – and by extension the banks' – problems...In sum, if you offer a guarantee – no matter whether you call it a banking deposit, an insurance policy, or a bet – regulation should ensure you have the capital to deliver." He also wrote that banks bought CDS to enable them to reduce the amount of capital they were required to hold against investments, thereby avoiding capital regulations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has proposed a framework for legislation to regulate derivatives.
Regulation of credit rating agencies.
Rating agencies such as Moody's and Standard and Poor's provide risk ratings for securities such as bonds and the mortgage-backed securities at the heart of the crisis. They are paid by the company issuing the bonds, which presents an independence issue. The rating agencies grossly erred in their assessment of risky mortgage-backed securities, providing the highest safety rating to securities that later became worthless.
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported in January 2011 that: "The three credit rating agencies were key enablers of the financial meltdown. The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms."
Other topics.
Federal regulatory influence of states.
Some have argued that, despite attempts by various U.S. states to prevent the growth of a secondary market in repackaged predatory loans, the Treasury Department's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, at the insistence of national banks, struck down such attempts as violations of Federal banking laws.
Conservative criticism before Congress.
During March 1995 congressional hearings William A. Niskanen, chair of the Cato Institute, criticized the proposals for political favoritism in allocating credit and micromanagement by regulators, and that there was no assurance that banks would not be expected to operate at a loss. He predicted they would be very costly to the economy and banking system, and that the primary long term effect would be to contract the banking system. He recommended Congress repeal CRA.
Gerald P. O'Driscoll, former vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, stated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had become classic examples of crony capitalism. Government backing let Fannie and Freddie dominate the mortgage underwriting. "The politicians created the mortgage giants, which then returned some of the profits to the pols - sometimes directly, as campaign funds; sometimes as "contributions" to favored constituents."
Some lawmakers received favorable treatment from financial institutions involved in the subprime industry. (See Countrywide financial political loan scandal). In June 2008 Conde Nast Portfolio reported that numerous Washington, DC politicians over recent years had received mortgage financing at noncompetitive rates at Countrywide Financial because the corporation considered the officeholders under a program called "FOA's"—"Friends of Angelo". Angelo being Countrywide's Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo.
On 18 June 2008, a Congressional ethics panel started examining allegations that chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd (D-CT), and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad (D-ND) received preferential loans by troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. Two former CEOs of Fannie Mae Franklin Raines and James A. Johnson also received preferential loans from the troubled mortgage lender. Fannie Mae was the biggest buyer of Countrywide's mortgages.
On September 10, 2003, U.S. Congressman Ron Paul gave a speech to Congress in which he argued that the then-current government policies encouraged lending to people who couldn't afford to pay the money back, and he predicted that this would lead to a bailout, and he introduced a bill to abolish these policies.
State and local governmental programs.
As part of the 1995 National Homeownership Strategy, HUD advocated greater involvement of state and local organizations in the promotion of affordable housing. In addition, it promoted the use of low or no-down payment loans and second, unsecured loans to the borrower to pay their down payments (if any) and closing costs. This idea manifested itself in "silent second" loans that became popular in several states such as California, and in scores of cities such as San Francisco. Using federal funds and their own funds, these states and cities offered borrowers loans that would defray the cost of the down payment. The loans were called "silent" because the primary lender was not supposed to know about them. A Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (affiliated with HUD) publicity sheet explicitly described the desired secrecy: "NRC affiliates hold the second mortgages. Instead of going to the family, the monthly voucher is paid to NRC affiliates. In this way the voucher is "invisible" to the traditional lender and the family (emphasis added).
In addition to the use of "silent seconds" HUD condoned and promoted the use of down payment gifting programs. These programs generally worked as follows: "Let's say someone wanted to buy a $100,000 house but didn't have the required down payment and closing costs, which we will say totaled $6,000. A nonprofit 'affordable housing' organization would provide the required $6000 to the homebuyer as a 'gift' and, simultaneously, collect the same amount — plus a tidy fee (usually 1% or a flat fee) — from the seller. The amount collected from the seller was called a 'donation' but, in reality, it was simply money laundering, conducted by pious organizations that talked about the poor and needy while raking in millions in revenues. Although HUD's Inspector General urged, in 2000, that seller-funded gift programs be banned, HUD resisted until 2008, well after the beginning of the subprime mortgage crisis. Seller-funded down payments were finally banned by an act of Congress in 2008.
Importance of home equity extraction to economic growth.
A significant driver of economic growth during the Bush administration was home equity extraction, in essence borrowing against the value of the home to finance personal consumption. Free cash used by consumers from equity extraction doubled from $627 billion in 2001 to $1,428 billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built, a total of nearly $5 trillion dollars over the period. Using the home as a source of funds also reduced the net savings rate significantly. By comparison, GDP grew by approximately $2.3 trillion during the same 2001-2005 period in current dollars, from $10.1 to $12.4 trillion.
Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2009: "The prosperity of a few years ago, such as it was — profits were terrific, wages not so much — depended on a huge bubble in housing, which replaced an earlier huge bubble in stocks. And since the housing bubble isn't coming back, the spending that sustained the economy in the pre-crisis years isn't coming back either." Niall Ferguson stated that excluding the effect of home equity extraction, the U.S. economy grew at a 1% rate during the Bush years. Since GDP growth is a significant indicator of the success of economic policy, the government had a vested interest in not fully explaining the role of home equity extraction (borrowing) in driving the GDP measure pre-crisis.
Moral hazard from other bailouts.
A taxpayer-funded government bailout of financial institutions during the savings and loan crisis may have created a moral hazard and acted as encouragement to lenders to make similar higher risk loans.

The Studdogs

The Studdogs was a rock band from Orlando, Florida. The band's music contains elements of punk, blues rock, garage rock, and noise rock. The band was formed in 2000 and stayed active until 2005. They released a lot of material, particularly the full-length album, "The Gospel According to the Studdogs" and the 7" vinyl 3-song EP, and gained local and national notoriety. They were featured in several national music magazines, including Magnet and Amplifier. Comparisons were made to the Stooges, Dead Boys, and it was said they sounded "like absolute victory by way of slurring, Rolling Stones-y garage rock from nowhere in particular." Their drunken, abrasive live shows often ended with someone bleeding or being thrown out of the venue. Their live shows were said to be "what Howling Wolf would sound like through a wall of noise and distortion." The band was signed by Orange Recordings in Los Angeles and toured all over the country, sharing bills with the Demolition Doll Rods, Bob Log III, The Fleshtones, and Immortal Lee County Killers and a one-time show with the Suicide Girls Burlesque Tour in Orlando. While in the Studdogs, Rich Evans began promoting concerts under the tag "Mutiny Productions". He now heads the independent "Florida's Dying" label, promoting and releasing material from the Florida-underground music scene. Kyle Justin joined the band on drums in early 2002 to replace Jason, who was moving to Texas. Kyle vacated his position as drummer in 2003 to pursue a music career in Los Angeles. Eric Gebhardt left the band in 2005 to pursue a solo career under the alias Red Mouth.

Dr. Music

Dr. Music was a Toronto jazz group founded in 1969 by producer, arranger and performer Doug Riley. The band recorded three albums and toured across Canada. The personnel of the band changed throughout its history, with Riley remaining at the core of the group.
History.
In 1969, Doug Riley became the music director for the television show “The Ray Stevens Show”. He was asked to put together a group of musicians to play for the 1969-1970 season of the show. Riley’s 16-piece vocal and instrumental band became known as Dr. Music. When the show was cancelled in 1970, Dr. Music remained together to record and tour Western Canada. Riley became partners with producer Terry Brown to form the Toronto Sound Recording Studio where Dr. Music recorded from 1970 to 1971. 
At this point, Dr. Music joined forces with the Canadian duo Terry Black and Laurel Ward, which led to a more vocal-driven sound for the band. In 1972, GRT Record Company released the group’s first recording entitled "Dr. Music", which included the hits “Sun Goes By”, “One More Mountain to Climb”, and “Try A Little Harder”. This album was produced by Riley and co-arranged by Riley and Steve Kennedy. Because of the number of singers in the band, this album had a gospel-rock feel, although it still fit within the jazz rock genre. 
Shortly after Dr. Music’s album release, the group disbanded, despite the success of the single "Sun Goes By". This gave Riley an opportunity to concentrate on his studio position at Toronto Sound Recording. In 1973, Doug Riley assembled a second version of Dr. Music. This group, however, was only a seven-piece ensemble. This new version of Dr. Music toured Western and Eastern Canada and released a new album, "Dr. Music II" . The group split up in 1974. 
Riley continued to produce and arrange for television shows. From 1973 to 1974, he worked as a music director on Keith Hampshire’s television series “Music Machine”. In 1974, he formed the third version of Dr. Music which became the house band of the show. This group recorded the album "Bedtime Story" at Toronto Sound Studios during February and March 1974. "Bedtime Story" consisted of jazz compositions by Riley and his band members, Claude Ranger and Don Thompson and fell under the genre of progressive jazz rock. 
Dr. Music continued to be a leading jazz band within Toronto throughout the 1970s but formally disbanded in 1977. In 1984, Riley resurrected the idea Dr. Music by creating a group composed of his musical friends. Together they recorded the album "Dr. Music Circa 1984."

Athanassio Comino

Athanassio Comino (1844-1897) was an Australian oyster merchant and businessman. Comino was born Kythera, Greece in 1844, son of Dimitrios Comino and his wife Agapy. 
Comino arrived in Sydney in 1873 as a crew member on a sailing ship and found work at the Balmain Colliery. A fish-and-chips shop owned by a Welshman in Oxford Street, Sydney and his familiarity with seafood in the Greek islands pointed him to the idea of a similar venture. In 1878, he opened an oyster saloon a few doors down from the fish-and-chips shop. From 1882 he took up the lease of oyster beds at the mouth of the Lane Cove River, then Port Jackson and the Evans River on the north coast. His brother John Comino came to Australia in 1885 and operated oyster leases on the Bermagui River.
Relatives and friends from Kythera who came out to Australia opened other shops and the Comino name became known in fish shops, oyster bars and oyster leases.
Comino became known as the ‘Oyster King’. He never married and at 53 died 30 December 1897 at Darlinghurst. He left an estate valued for probate at £5217 to his brother John, nephews and nieces.

Artemisia palmeri

Artemisia palmeri is a rare species of sagebrush known by the common names San Diego sagewort and Palmer sagewort. 
It is native to northern Baja California and San Diego County, California, where its natural habitat is sandy coastal ravines and river drainages. Most of this habitat has been destroyed as the land has been claimed for human use. It is occasionally found farther inland in chaparral plant communities in the region. This is a perennial or biennial herb producing brittle erect or spreading stems 1 to 3 meters tall. The base is woody. The aromatic foliage is made up of long, narrow leaves deeply cut into several narrow, pointed lobes. The inflorescence contains clusters of flower heads containing pale yellow glandular disc florets. The fruit is a tiny achene about a millimeter long.

Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway

The Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway, which later became the Edinburgh, Leith and Granton Railway, was a railway in Edinburgh. It carried passengers and freight between the city centre and the northern ports. It was Edinburgh's second railway, after the Duke of Buccleuch's Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway. All of the original route has been dismantled, but part of one of its later connections remains in use for freight.
Formation.
The Act of Parliament to allow building of the railway received its Royal Assent on 13 August 1836. A further Act of Parliament on 1 July 1839 authorised an extension to Newhaven and abandonment of the Leith portion. A third Act, on 19 July 1844, reconstituted the company as the Edinburgh, Leith and Granton Railway.
Route history.
The line was originally horse-drawn, and ran from Canonmills (later Scotland Street) to Newhaven (later Trinity), with services beginning on 31 August 1842. As well as carrying passengers and cargo between the port and the city, it gave access to the Trinity Chain Pier at Newhaven which was popular with bathers. On 19 February 1846 the line was extended into the Duke of Buccleuch's recently built harbour at Granton (completed in 1838), and became the Edinburgh, Leith and Granton Railway.
A branch to Leith was opened on 10 May 1846; Citadel station in Leith (formerly North Leith) is one of the remaining structures from the original line. It is now a youth centre. An intermediate station was provided at Bonnington, and Junction Road opened in 1869.
It was further extended to its city centre terminus at Canal Street in 1847, by the Scotland Street tunnel. This carried the line from Canal Street under Edinburgh's New Town with a peak gradient of 1 in 27, using a stationary engine to haul trains up the slope with an endless rope. Canal Street was later absorbed into Waverley station. It was named after an ornamental canal, proposed to replace the Nor Loch but never built. The tunnel was designed by the renowned civil engineer Thomas Grainger, and its construction supervised by George Buchanan. The difficulties overcome included shifting sand under the New Town, and concerned property owners above ground. The tunnel is just below street level at Scotland Street, but is 49 feet (15 m) below St. Andrew Street and 37 feet (11 m) below Princes Street. At the same time as the tunnel was opened, horse power was abandoned on the rest of the network in favour of steam locomotives.
On 27 July 1847, the company was taken over by the Edinburgh and Northern Railway.
At Granton, the world's first train ferry took goods wagons by boat to Burntisland in Fife. The service commenced on 3 February 1850. Thomas Bouch designed the ferry slip. The ferry was the "Leviathan", and was also designed by Thomas Grainger. From Burntisland, Edinburgh and Northern Railway services connected to Perth and Tayport (ferry to Broughty Ferry, for Dundee). It was intended as a temporary measure until the railway could build a bridge, but this, the Forth Railway Bridge, was not opened until 1890, its construction delayed in part by repercussions from the catastrophic failure of Bouch's Tay Rail Bridge. The through train ferry service was withdrawn in 1876, but a passenger ferry continued for many years.
On 29 July 1862 the line was taken over by the North British Railway. In 1868 they connected it to the East Coast Main Line at Piershill and Abbeyhill, allowing the closure of Scotland Street tunnel. Scotland Street station was retained as a goods depot until 1967, with access only from the north. Scotland Street tunnel was used to store wagons, then for commercial mushroom growing (1887-1929), and as an air raid shelter during World War II. It was also used as one of ten emergency control centres for the LNER during the war. In the 1970s, Cochranes Garages used the north end to store vehicles. The southern entrance to the tunnel, long abandoned, was rediscovered in 1983 during the construction of Waverley Market. The site of the station, at the northern end of the tunnel, is now a children's play park.
In 1902 the line was extended to Granton Gas Works, and given a connection to the Caledonian Railway network. In 1903 the North British opened a new line into Leith Central railway station. This closed to passengers on 7 April 1952, and final closure after a period as a motive power depot was on 29 April 1972.
The North British Railway was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway at the Grouping in 1923, and LNER was in turn absorbed by British Rail in 1948. Passenger services to Granton were discontinued in 1925, and freight in 1986. The last few cargoes were naphtha.
The loop via Piershill and Abbeyhill was retained and used as a diversion for slower trains, and in both 1970 and 1986 a temporary passenger halt at Meadowbank was built for the duration of the Commonwealth Games. It fell into disuse upon electrification of the East Coast Main Line in 1989. As of 2006 track was still in place on the Abbeyhill loop from Piershill Junction to Abbeyhill Junction, but the junction to the main line had been disconnected. The embankment along the shore from Trinity to Granton was removed and landscaped in the 1990s.
Current operations.
A section of the 1868 connecting line, from Powderhall to the East Coast Main Line, is still in use, and is used to carry waste from the waste management plant at Powderhall to a landfill site in East Lothian.

Mustafa Agha Barbar

Mustafa Agha Barbar (born 1767) was a governor of the Ottoman provinces of Tripoli, Lebanon and Latakia, Syria for the Ottomans. He ruled between 1800–08, 1810–20 and 1821-35.
Name.
The middle word in his name, Agha, is actually a title derived from the Turkish word for "chief, master, or lord." It was a title for a civil or military officer in the Ottoman Empire, and was placed after the name of such military functionaries. Also, his surname, Barbar, may connect him in some way to the Berber ethnic group of north Africa, since the Arabic word for "Berber" is pronounced as ""Bar-bar"".
Biography.
Barbar was originally a peasant from Al-Qalamoun, in the Koura District. At the beginning of his career he was in the service of Emir Hasan (the brother of Emir Bashir Shihab II). By virtue of his acumen, bravery, skill and energy, he attained high office and acquired standing among the viziers and subjects. It is said that he was the chief antagonist of Emir Bashir Shihab II around Abdullah Pasha (the Ottoman Governor of Damascus).
He was appointed governor of Tripoli by the Ottomans in 1798. In the early 19th century, he had extensive restoration work done on the Citadel of Tripoli (castle of Saint Gilles), resulting in its present state. Later on, he endowed large portions of his property in Tripoli to his wives, relatives and slaves (mamluks), shortly after his grip on power was challenged. He also endowed property in Tripoli for the building of a canal and two water fountains, in order to enhance his local image. In 1816, Barbar built the fortress of Iaal. That same year, soldiers serving him ravaged a number of Syrian Ismaili Shia villages, which proved disastrous for the Ismailis of Syria. This included the final destruction of the Al-Kahf Castle. 
Between 1820 and 1825, an Ottoman imperial decree went forth, ordering for Barbar's execution. He came to the Mount Lebanon Governorate, seeking asylum with Emir Bashir, who appointed a residence for him and his people in the village of Shwayfat (Aley District), until he could obtain a pardon through the offices of the governor of Egypt, Muhammad Ali (with whom Emir Bashir was allied). A friendship thus was formed between the former enemies.
In October, 1833, Barbar was dismissed from office and arrested by the new Egyptian authorities. Muhammad Ali of Egypt was now in control, as opposed to the previous Ottomans. Barbar was arrested his levying the ‘awayid, a tax levied to support the officeholders. from his subjects, which was prohibited by the new Egyptian authorities
Barbar died April 28, 1835, possibly due to a heart attack or a similar affliction. He was buried at the Iaal fortress on April 29.
Some of his modern descendants now live in Tripoli and Iaal, Lebanon.

Chinese aviation training ship Shichang

"Shichang" (82) is China's first aviation ship. It primarily serves as a training ship, helicopter launch vehicle, and medical treatment facility in the People's Liberation Army Navy. The ship is named after Qing Dynasty Imperial Chinese Navy Captain Deng Shichang, who died in a battle between Chinese and Japanese navies during the First Sino-Japanese War.
Experience during drills and war games revealed the lack of shipboard armaments makes "Shichang" inadequate for training weaponry operating crews. However, the ship provides sufficient training for all other crew functions. The layout of the ship is very similar to that of , emphasizing helicopter training ship and helicopter support ship missions.
The modular design of the ship incorporates containerized modules used to expand its mission. More trainees can be accommodated with additional housing and training containers, or medical capability can be rapidly improved by addition of a containerized field hospital.

The A Day at the Races Tour was a concert tour by the British rock band Queen, and supported their late 1976 album "A Day at the Races".
This tour was the first to use the song "Somebody to Love" and many others. "Brighton Rock" and "Bohemian Rhapsody" were performed in full for the first time. Also, singer Freddie Mercury performed a vocal canon to segue between "White Man" and "The Prophet's Song". 
The opening act on most of the North American leg was Thin Lizzy. In New York City, the concert at Madison Square Garden was sold out within moments of tickets going on sale.
The final two shows on the tour at Earls Court was filmed and is widely traded among fans. These shows were of note as the band used an expensive lighting rig in the shape of a crown for the very first time. Both shows were also officially recorded on video and the first show was also released on many bootlegs in almost excellent quality. Both gigs included a Rock 'n' Roll Medley (this medley is also the only bootleg recording from the second night).

<doc id="19799293" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19799293" title="Palatine High School">
Palatine High School

Palatine High School, or PHS, is a public four-year high school in Township High School District 211. Located at 1111 N. Rohlwing Rd in Palatine, Illinois, United States, a northwest suburb of Chicago. It serves primarily all of and only those areas of Palatine northeast of the UP NW tracks, but also serves as a magnet school for the entire district's special education program.
History.
Palatine High School was founded in 1875, the first public high school in what are now the northwest suburbs of Chicago. Its operation was reorganized into a modern school district in 1914, and in 1928 the high school built its first dedicated school building. It served the entirety of Palatine Township as a public high school, and also admitted paying students from neighboring Schaumburg Township.
In the 1950s, rising enrollments due to suburban expansion and the baby boom caused many changes. Palatine High School's district formally expanded to include Schaumburg Township, two additions were built in rapid succession, and additional school buildings were built in the southwest part of Palatine (William Fremd High School) and in Schaumburg (James B. Conant High School). The student distribution changed as Fremd served as a school for freshmen and sophomores while Palatine High School served juniors and seniors.
The current three-story facility was completed in 1977, and a second gymnasium was built in 1997. 
In 2003 a new math and foreign language wing was built. This new three-story wing included 24 new classrooms and activity areas, and added to the existing building.
In the summer of 2009, Palatine's Chic Anderson Stadium was installed with an artificial turf for nearly $1.5 million.
Academics.
All schools in District 211 have been accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools; PHS's is the oldest accreditation in the district, dating back to April 1, 1935.
PHS is not making Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) as a part of the federal No Child Left Behind Act because multiple sub groups within the student population failed to meet minimum standards. 2008 also marks the third year the school has been on academic watch.
In 2008, Palatine High School had an average composite ACT score of 22.1. 92.3% of the class of 2008 graduated.
Applied Technology Department
PHS maintains a comprehensive applied technology department with classes such as Computer-Aided Design, Small Engines, Automotives, Home Construction, Woodshop, Metals, and a Plastics course when demand is large enough. Recently, the Applied Technology Department has brought in "Project Lead the Way" Courses: Introduction to Engineering Design, Principles of Engineering, Digital Electronics, and Civil Engineering and Architecture to further bolster the classes offered to students. These classes are all engineering based curriculum that offer the possibility for students to earn some college credit. PHS is certified through Harper College to teach certain classes that count towards credit for receiving an apprenticeship with a Master Electrician. There is also a computer repair class that is certified through the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) where students that pass the qualification exam receive an A+ Certification, demonstrating competency as a computer technician.
Awards.
Peer Mediation, a district wide program for the resolution of peer conflicts by peer interventions, won the 1999 Peaceleader Award from the Illinois Center for the Prevention of Violence.
PHS has twice received the U. S. Department of Education's Blue Ribbon Award, once in the 1992-1993 school year, and again in 1999-2000.
In 2000, PHS was one of few high schools named a New American High School. The award, last given in 2000, was given to schools which serve as "model" schools based on innovation.
PHS was selected as an Outstanding American High School by receiving a Silver Medal from U.S. News and World Report magazine.
In 2008, the school was ranked 1157 in the annual Newsweek Magazine Top 1,300 high schools in America. The school had previous been ranked in 2007 (1204) and 2005 (992).
Activities.
PHS currently offers over 80 extracurricular activities for students to participate in.

<doc id="19799344" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19799344" title="Reichskolonialbund">
Reichskolonialbund

The Reichskolonialbund (RKB) (English: Reich Colonial League) was a collective body that absorbed all German colonial organisations during the time of the Third Reich. It was led by Franz Ritter von Epp.
The Reichskolonialbund was active between 1936 and 1943.
History.
Background.
The purpose of the Reichskolonialbund was to reclaim the overseas colonies that Germany had lost as a result of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I. In order to expand its forerunner organisations played on the feeling, shared by most Germans, that Germany had been humiliated by the Versailles Treaty.
The first efforts in rallying support for a re-establishment of a German Colonial Empire in Germany can be traced back to 1923. As a result a number of pro-colonial organisations, supported by both conservative-minded Germans and nationalists, were established in different parts of Germany. Founded in 1925, the foremost outfit was the "Koloniale Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft" (KORAG). This organisation, along with other groups, led to the foundation of the preliminary Reichskolonialbund in 1933. The establishment was made in two steps, the second one being its incorporation "(Gliederung)" into the Nazi Party structure; as a result many references give two different years for the Nazi Reichskolonialbund foundation, 1933 and 1936.
Establishment.
The Reichskolonialbund was established on 13 June 1936 by the former governor of German East Africa, Dr. Heinrich Schnee. Whether the organisations that joined it did so freely, or were forced to do so in the name of "Gleichschaltung", is a subject of conjecture. 
Led by Ritter von Epp, the organisation's alleged purpose was to '"..."keep the population informed about the loss of the German Imperial colonies, to maintain contact with the former colonial territories and to create conditions in opinion favourable to a new German African Empire.""
The foundation of RKB was marred with difficulties, for only two months after its establishment, Rudolf Hess decreed its disbandment. However, after lengthy discussions the decree was revoked in November of the same year.
As part of the Nazi triumphalism for the Third Reich, the Reichskolonialbund was intended to take over the role of the then-disbanded German Colonial Society, ("Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft") (DKG). Since Germany had no colonies, the Reichskolonialbund was mainly engaged in mostly virulent political agitation.
The agitation was conducted largely in Germany by means of newspapers, magazines, conferences and "Colonial Exhibitions". This activity was meant to keep open the so-called Colonial Question (Kolonialfrage) and to gather funds for the organisation. The most important weekly publications of the Reichskolonialbund between 1937 and 1943 were "Kolonie und Heimat" and the "Deutsche Kolonialzeitung", the former mouthpiece of the German Colonial Company. The RKB also printed colourful posters for the advancement of its cause.
The Reichskolonialbund had its own youth organization, the Colonial Youth, which was incorporated as a wing of the Hitler Youth. Its members wore the regular Hitler Youth uniform with Reichskolonialbund badges and insignias. The youth regularly staged rallies and collected money for the colonial cause during the events organised by the Reichskolonialbund.
Adult members of the Reichskolonialbund also wore uniform during parades and rallies. The design was inspired by the Schutztruppe uniforms of the German Imperial Era.
The Reichskolonialbund held two parliamentary sessions, the first in Bremen in May 1938 and the second in Vienna in May 1939.
Twilight and end.
The decline of the Reichskolonialbund began with the onset of World War II, when the Nazi State focused on other priorities, foremost of which was the search for a Lebensraum in the East of Europe. Finally in 1943 the Reichsleiter Martin Bormann pressed for the dissolution of the Reichskolonialbund on the grounds of ""kriegsunwichtiger Tätigkeit"" ("activity irrelevant to the war"). Hence the Reichskolonialbund was swiftly disbanded by a decree of the Führer in 1943.
The disbandment of the organisation and its assets was harsh and without ceremony, almost equaling a requisition "(Beschlagnahmung)". Most of the Reichskolonialbund's files lie in the archives in Koblenz, where there are 5,140 documents from the period 1925 to 1943.

<doc id="19799359" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19799359" title="Nasal fracture">
Nasal fracture

A nasal fracture, commonly referred to as a broken nose, is a fracture of one of the bones of the nose. Because of the protrusion of the nose from the face and the fragility of the bones of the nose, a broken nose is one of the most common facial injuries, comprising almost 40% of all facial injuries.
Causes.
Nasal fractures are caused by physical trauma to the face. Common sources of nasal fractures include sports injuries, fighting, falls, and car accidents in the younger age groups, and falls from syncope or impaired balance in the elderly.
Symptoms.
Symptoms of a broken nose include bruising, swelling, tenderness, pain, deformity, and/or bleeding of the nose and nasal region of the face. The patient may have difficulty breathing, or excessive nosebleeds (if the nasal mucosa are damaged).
Diagnosis.
Nasal fractures are usually identified visually and through physical examination. A priority is to distinguish simple fractures limited to the nasal bones (Type 1) from fractures that also involve other facial bones and/or the nasal septum (Types 2 and 3). In simple Type 1 fractures X-Rays supply surprisingly little information beyond clinical examination. However, diagnosis may be confirmed with X-rays or CT scans, and these are required if other facial injuries are suspected.
Although treatment of an uncomplicated fracture of nasal bones is not urgent, referral for specific treatment in five to seven days usually suffices, an associated injury, nasal septal hematoma, occurs in about 5% of cases and does require urgent treatment and should be looked for during the assessment of nasal injuries.
Treatment.
Minor nasal fractures may be allowed to heal on their own provided there is not significant cosmetic deformity. Ice and pain medication may be prescribed to ease discomfort during the healing process. For nasal fractures where the nose has been deformed, manual alignment may be attempted, usually with good results. Injuries involving other structures (Types 2 and 3) must be recognized and treated surgically.

The Wenlock River is a major river of the Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland, Australia. It rises in the Great Dividing Range, flows north-west through tropical savanna plains and wetlands, and enters the Gulf of Carpentaria on the western side of the peninsula at Port Musgrave just north of Mapoon.
The total catchment size is . The river has no water storage facilities built on it and there is little development within the drainage basin, resulting in a low population.
Much of the river is bordered by gallery rainforests which provide habitat for animals such as the White-tailed Rat, Spotted Cuscus and Palm Cockatoo. During the wet season the river floods, replenishing the wetlands. With some 48 species, the river contains the highest diversity of freshwater fish of all Australian rivers, many of which are shared with the rivers of southern New Guinea. They include Buffon's River Garfish and Fimbriate Gudgeon, as well as the Freshwater Sawfish and more common species such as the Sooty Grunter, Saratoga and Barramundi. The river is also home to one of Queensland’s largest breeding populations of the Saltwater Crocodile.

Two Working Men

Two Working Men () are a pair of statues made by the Irish sculptor Oisín Kelly. The piece took Kelly three years to create and was unveiled in front of the County Hall in Cork in 1969. As with other works of public art in Ireland, the statues took on a local colloquial name, and are still commonly known as ""Cha and Miah"".
History.
"Two Working Men" became Kelly's second statue on public display, after his acclaimed "Children of Lir" was unveiled at Dublin's Garden of Remembrance in 1966. That year, Kelly received a commission for a new statue, to be erected outside Liberty Hall in Dublin, which at the time was Ireland's tallest building and the headquarters of the Services, Industrial, Professional & Technical Union (SIPTU).
Before the statues were to be moved outside Liberty Hall however, SIPTU deemed that they would pose a traffic hazard. In 2007 Desmond Rea O'Kelly, architect of Liberty Hall, reflected on this lost opportunity:
The work was instead unveiled in front of Cork's new county hall building in 1969, which during the time the statues were being made had unseated Liberty Hall as the tallest building in Ireland. (It would remain the tallest building in Ireland until 2008.) 
The statues were removed for a period during the redevelopment of the County Hall, but were replaced in 2006.
Appearance and legacy.
The statues consist of two men, one tall and thin and the other shorter and stout. The shorter man is shown wearing a cap and clasping his hands behind his back while the taller man's hands are placed on his hips. Both men are gazing skyward, ostensibly at the top of the building. The statue's key message is to profile the common "everyday Irish person" admiring the finished product of work in a modern Ireland.
In the years after their unveiling, the statues became known locally as "Cha and Miah". The label derives from the names of two "everyman" Cork characters on the "Hall's Pictorial Weekly" television show which became popular in the early 1970s.

Transnationality Index

The Transnationality Index (TNI) is a means of ranking multinational corporations that is employed by economists and politicians. It is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the following three ratios (where "foreign" means outside of the corporation's home country):
The Transnationality Index was developed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
Multinational corporations are also ranked by the amount of foreign assets that they own. However, the TNI ranking can differ markedly from this. For example, as of 2000, General Electric was the second largest multinational corporation in terms of foreign assert ownership. However, it ranked only 73rd by the TNI, with an index of only 40%. Although the company had large investments outside of the United States, most of its sales, employment, and assets were within the U.S.. In contrast, Exxon has a TNI of 68% and Vodafone has a TNI of 81%. As of 2001, General Electric ranked 75th, with a TNI of 36.7%. The 14 most transnational corporations originated in small countries (Switzerland, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada), whereas the largest multinational corporations in terms of foreign asset ownership all had low TNI scores. General Motors, the fourth largest multinational corporation in terms of foreign asset ownership only ranked 83rd (30.7%) on the TNI top 100. IBM ranked 50th (53.7%), Volkswagen ranked 45th (55.7%), and Toyota, the sixth largest multinational corporation in terms of foreign asset ownership, only ranked 82nd (30.9%) on the broader TNI scale.
Peter Dicken, an honorary fellow of the School of Environment and Development at the University of Manchester, argues that TNI data refute the assertions of hyperglobalism. The data, he argues, prove false the claim that multinational corporations are "inexorably, and inevitably, abandoning their ties to their country of origin". If that were the case, we would expect the largest multinational corporations to have the majority of their assets, sales, and employmnent outside of their countries of origin, and thus the majority of those corporations to have high TNIs. In fact, in the UNCTAD TNI data for the top 100 multinational corporations for 2001, the mean TNI is 52.6%, 57 of the 100 have a TNI greater than 50%, and only a mere 16 have a TNI greater than 75%. Thus, he concludes, measured TNI data provide little evidence for multinational corporations having the proportions of their assets, sales, and employees outside of their home countries that one would expect for truly global firms.

German Colonial Society

The German Colonial Society () (DKG) was a German organisation formed on 19 December 1887 to promote German colonialism. The Society was formed through the merger of the German Colonial Association (Deutscher Kolonialverein; established in 1882) and the Society for German Colonization (Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonialisation; established in 1884). The Society was headquartered in Berlin.
The German Colonial Society worked in close cooperation with the Pan-German League and was much influential in the German Empire. Among its leaders were Hermann, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, Carl Peters and several members of parliament. Upon its formation the Society had approximately 15,000 members and by 1914 the number of members had increased to 42,000. The foremost goal of the Society was to work for a more expansive German colonial policy. From 1916 plans were made for a German colonial empire in Africa, the so-called "Deutsch-Mittelafrika", as well as anectations in East Asia. After Germany lost its colonies at the end of the First World War, the Society propagated for their reoccupation. After the Nazi party seized power in Germany, the Society was absorbed by the "Reichskolonialbund",

Hermann Büchting

Hermann Wilhelm Georg Büchting (14 March 1916 in Neumünster – 27 June 1992 in Rellingen) was a German Schnellboot commander in World War II and recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.
Career.
Herman Büchting was born on 14 March 1916 in Neumünster/Holstein. He joined the Navy in April 1935 and went through training in Stralsund. Following his training, he went aboard the new sail training ship "Gorch Fock" for two months of seamanship training. This was followed by a nine-month goodwill tour aboard the light cruiser "Karlsruhe" which would take it from Keil, around the Cape of Good Hope to the Far East and return to Kiel by way of the Panama Canal.
Büchting then attended the Naval Academy at Mürwik, Flensburg, graduating from his officer training as a Fähnrich zur See (officer cadet) in March 1937. He continued his cadet training program by attending a series of courses, including torpedo school and intelligence school, before being sent to the Torpedo Boat Training Flottille as a Wache Offizier.
Promotions came quickly as he was elevated to Oberfähnrich on 1 January 1939 and commissioned "Leutnant zur See" in April. In October, after completing his torpedo boat training, he was ordered to the 5. Torpedobootsflottille. He was assigned to the Torpedoboot Grief, one of the first 12 new torpedo boats built for the German navy. The boat carried a 122-man crew, displaced 930 tons, and could steam at 33 knots. On 1 October 1939 Büchting was promoted to "Oberleutnant zur See".
With the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, he served in the North Sea and Skagerrak on mine laying and coastal security duties. Skagerrak is a triangular area of water with Norway and Sweden to the north and Denmark to the south. (On 31 May and 1 June 1916, the British Grand Fleet and the German High Seas Fleet clashed in this area, known as the "Battle of Jutland", or "The Battle of Skagerrak" in Germany.)
Kapitänleutnant Erich Bey formed the first Schnellboot (E-boat) flotilla in the mid-1930s. The early Schnellbooten could reach a maximum speed of 37 knots and saw action during the Spanish Civil War. In 1938, a second flotilla was formed at Wilhelmshaven and had a complement of 18 boats at the start of the war.
Büchting transferred to the Schnellbooten in March 1940. He was attached to the 1. Schnellbootsflotille, where he commanded several boats, including "S-18", "S-21", "S-25", "S-27" and "S-51". On 20 April 1940 he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class.
With the evacuation of British and French forces from Dunkirk on 26 May 1940, E-boats were immediately deployed and sank the French destroyers "Orage" and "Sirocco". They were also responsible for sinking the British ship Wakeful and damaging another.
These boats began operating from bases in occupied France and saw action in the English Channel and the mouth of the Thames River. They were particularly successful in the Straits of Dover. Büchting received his next decorations, the Iron Cross 1st Class, on 3 January 1941.
In mid 1941, Büchting was in action off the Finnish Coast, and in early 1942 he was transferred to the Black Sea. This was followed by a promotion to "Kapitänleutnant" on 1 June 1942.
on April 22, 1943 Büchting, commander of S51 of the 1.Schnellbootsflottile, was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his successes as an E-boat commander. On 1 September 1943 he was given command of 1.Schnellbootsflotilla, a position that he would retain until the end of the war.
The E-boats continued to give the Allies trouble along the coasts of Europe. About 250 E-boats were built, and after 1943 the bridges were armed to protect against low-flying airplanes.
Büchting continued his operations in the Black Sea and was promoted to Korvettenkapitän on 1 June 1944. During the last several months of the war, Büchting and the 1. Schnellbootsflotille were back in the Baltic seeing action in the Danzig-Grotenhafen area. They were also active along the Kurland (Latvia) Coast, where they helped in defending the evacuation of large numbers of civilian refugees and military personnel, which otherwise would fall victim to Russian captivity or even death. Büchting would become a prisoner of war on 9 May 1945 and would remain a POW until 18 August 1945.
After the war, Büchting became a successful businessman and died in Rellingen, Germany on 27 June 1992.

An ethnic Mongol, and an official in Xuanhui Yuan (the Ministry of Court Supplies and Provisions), around 1315 Hu Sihui initially emerged as the therapist of Empress Dowager, soon also became the therapist of the acting Empress, and later received the rank of the chief Imperial therapist and became responsible for food and drinks of the numerous Emperor's family. 
As tradition has it, Buyantu Khan, after several years of expeditions and irregular life, was overstrained and suffered acute pain in his kidneys. The vegetable soup prescribed by Hu Sihui cured the pains in 3 months, and one of Emperor's spouses became pregnant. The Emperor grandly awarded Hu Sihui as the cause of this "double joy". 
In 1330 Hu Sihui, no longer busy with the Emperor and his harem, completed and presented to the Court his book Yinshan Zhengyao (饮膳正要), summarising the experiences of the court dietitian. The main idea of his work was that people preparing food for the Emperor are directly responsible for efficiency of the State, as a monarch may get sick from improper eating, and lose ability of managing state affairs.
Important principles.
"Yinshan Zhengyao" states that a significant number of diseases is caused by improper eating, and a significant part of them can be cured by proper eating. The book propagated moderation, regularity and variety in food, proper hygiene and food storage, and special diets for pregnant women and for children. This book was the first to describe in detail how diseases are connected to deficiency of certain components in food. It was probably the first book in China to dwell on food poisoning. 
Recipes presented show strong Han Chinese as well as Mongolian, Turkic and Persian influences. As Hu Sihui states, a large variety of foods were known in the court since Kublai Khan and this novelty needed special research as to its influence on health. Taken as a collection of recipes and ingredients alone, his book is a tremendously important description of Medieval food of Eurasia.
The section of recipes starts with a variety soups, barley, then noodles and breads. Many recipes represent Central and West Asian cooking traditions, roughly translated into Chinese categories, some even translated from Turkic languages. Two examples of recipes are:
Legacy.
Hu Sihui's book was widely accepted in Later Yuan, but won even wider influence after the fall of Yuan. Ming Dynasty, after occupying Beijing in 1368, started to combine Chinese cuisine from other regions with the cosmopolitan cuisine of Yuan court. Jingtai Emperor of Ming (ruled 1449—1457) personally wrote a preface to an edition of Yinshan Zhengyao. 
As a culinary encyclopedia, this book made some regional recipes aссepted as part of national cuisine of the whole of China. For example, it is this book that contained a recipe of a roast duck that could be a predecessor of the widely known Beijing Duck.

<doc id="19800047" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19800047" title="Halo (Beyoncé song)">
Halo (Beyoncé song)

"Halo" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for her third studio album, "I Am... Sasha Fierce" (2008). Included on the "I Am..." disc, it was intended to give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyoncé's life, stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. Columbia Records released the song, the album's fourth single, to mainstream radio in the United States on January 20, 2009, and to international markets from February 20. Inspired by Ray LaMontagne's 2004 song "Shelter", "Halo" was composed by Ryan Tedder, Evan Bogart Eric "Nealante'" Phillips and Beyoncé. It was conceived by Tedder and Nealante specifically for Beyoncé, although there was media speculation that it had been intended for Leona Lewis.
"Halo" is an pop power ballad, the lyrics of which describe a sublime love. It features drum, piano, keyboard, string, synthesizer, and percussion instrumentation. Kelly Clarkson claimed that Tedder reused the musical arrangement in her 2009 song "Already Gone". "Halo" received positive reviews from music critics, who made comparisons with Lewis' 2007 song "Bleeding Love". Its production and Beyoncé's emotional vocals also received critical praise. "Halo" was nominated for Record of the Year and won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 52nd Grammy Awards. It won Best Song at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards. "Halo" topped the singles charts of Brazil, Norway and Slovakia, and reached the top five on the singles chart of Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the US. It was certified quadruple-platinum in Australia, and double-platinum in Spain and the US.
Philip Andelman directed the ballad's accompanying music video, which features American actor Michael Ealy. It portrays a romantic relationship between Beyoncé's and Ealy's characters. Critics complimented Beyoncé's looks in the clip. An alternative music video, which shows Ealy's character being chased by police through a forest at night, was posted on the Internet in May 2010. The lyrics to "Halo" were changed for two of Beyoncé's special live performances: in a tribute to Michael Jackson following his death, and in a tribute to the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The song has been covered by many artists, including Florence and the Machine, Harper Blynn, and Westlife. It was performed on the television show "Glee", and was added to the international soundtrack of the Brazilian soap opera "India – A Love Story".
Writing and production.
"Halo" was composed by Ryan Tedder, lead vocalist of OneRepublic, together with Evan "Kidd" Bogart and Beyoncé. In an interview for HitQuarters, Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his Achilles tendon and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer Ray LaMontagne was the primary inspiration for "Halo". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's "Shelter" for Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z, and proposed the title "Halo" after hearing Tedder play "angelic" chords. They wrote the song in three hours.
According to Simon Cowell, owner of the music production company Syco Entertainment, Bogart and Tedder intended "Halo" for his client, singer Leona Lewis, who could not record the song because of her tight schedule. Cowell was upset that Beyoncé chose to record the song. David Balls, editor of the British media website Digital Spy, asked Tedder during an interview whether "Halo" had initially been written for Lewis. Tedder answered that he had only tentatively offered the track to Lewis, after Beyoncé waited a long time before recording it. He commented:
There was this huge scandal that originally "Halo" was meant to go to Leona. That was never the case ... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song ... I thought this would be a brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have ... What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just want to know if you like it enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they flipped on it. They loved it and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!"
Tedder and Beyoncé produced "Halo" in 2008 at Los Angeles' Manfield Studios, and at New York City's Germano and Roc The Mic Studios. Tedder did the musical arrangements and played the instruments, while Christian Baker assisted in recording the music. Mark "Spike" Stent mixed the track with assistance from Matt Green, and Jim Caruana recorded Beyoncé's vocals; both these tasks were done at Roc the Mic Studios. "Halo" is present on the "I Am..." disc of the double album "I Am... Sasha Fierce", as it is a ballad that shows Beyoncé's insecurities about love, and the person she is "underneath all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama". Beyoncé has said that she loves singing ballads because, "... the music and the emotion in the story is told so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear what I had to say."
Composition and lyrical interpretation.
"Halo" is a contemporary downtempo power ballad that features a pop production. It has elements of gospel and soul music. Instrumentation is provided by a piano, a keyboard, big drums, a synthesizer, strings, and percussion instruments. The cascading piano work is accompanied by percussive beats that alternate between handclaps and foot stomps. "Halo" was composed using common time in the key of A major, with a tempo of 84 beats per minute. It is built on the chord progression A–Bm–Fm–D, and is written in the common verse–chorus form. Beyoncé’s vocals span from C3 to the "falsetto" note of F5, incorporate melisma, and are supported by backing vocals. She ornaments her singing with vibrato yelps and trills—rapid alternations between two adjacent notes, usually a semitone or tone apart. The arrangement also consists of symphonic "crescendos" and electronic accents.
In "Halo", Beyoncé professes her all-encompassing love to her heavenly lover with open-hearted emotion. She said, "['Halo'] is angelic ... like you see faces instantly when you hear it. [Its lyrics are basically saying that I had these walls built up about love; you completely tore them down and when I look at you I see your halo, it's really beautiful." Backed by a piano, claps and step stomps that set a spiritualized atmosphere, Beyoncé opens the song 
with the lines: "Remember those walls I built? Well, baby, they're tumbling down". She sings the introduction in a low register, and the power of her voice gradually increases as the song progresses. In the pre-chorus, she chants, "Everywhere I'm looking now, I'm surrounded by your embrace, baby I can see your halo, you know you're my saving grace, you're everything I need and more, it's written all over your face". Beyoncé then echoes the word "halo" in the chorus; the third and final one is preceded by a 1980s drum breakdown, and is complemented by sweeping strings and percussion.
Release.
"Halo" and "Ego" were initially planned for simultaneous release in the US, following the 2008 dual lead singles "If I Were a Boy" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". But the release of "Ego" was canceled and replaced with "Diva". "Halo" was taken from a different disc of "I Am... Sasha Fierce" to "Diva"; the intention was to demonstrate the concept that Beyoncé has conflicting personalities—the central theme of the album. The motif was demonstrated by placing the album's ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. "Halo" was sent by Music World Entertainment and Columbia Records to contemporary hit radio playlists on January 20, 2009, while "Diva" was classified for rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio playlists. A digital extended play (EP) containing a radio edit and four remixes of "Halo" was later released on April 14, 2009.
On February 20, 2009, "Halo" was released as a two-track digital download, including a remix of "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada—where the song was also made available on a digital EP, as a maxi single and a vinyl single on April 14, 2009. In France, it was released as a stand-alone digital download on March 20, 2009. On the same date, "Halo" was serviced digitally alongside the album version of "Diva" in mainland Europe, including Germany, where it was also made available as a CD single on April 3 and a vinyl single on April 12, 2009. In the United Kingdom, a digital EP containing the album version and three remixes of "Halo" was released on April 13, 2009.
Kelly Clarkson accusation.
Soon after composing "Halo", Tedder worked with Kelly Clarkson on her fourth studio album, "All I Ever Wanted" (2009), for which they wrote "Already Gone" together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé’s "Halo". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent "Already Gone" from being included on "All I Ever Wanted", but the decision was out of her hands, as her album was already being printed when "I Am... Sasha Fierce" came out. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both "Already Gone" and "Halo", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.
Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder commented that he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her criticism was "hurtful and absurd". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of "Already Gone" and "Halo" are completely different. Calling "Already Gone" one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to "listen the two ballads and form their own opinions". Clarkson discouraged her label, RCA, from releasing "Already Gone" as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, "It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it." Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate "Already Gone" and "Halo" sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.
Critical reception.
Reviews.
Christian Williams of "Billboard" magazine wrote that the pop sound of "Halo" should take it to the top of the charts. He added that comparisons could be made to Lewis' "Bleeding Love" (2007), but concluded that "Halo" "hangs high on its own merits". Michael Slezak of "Entertainment Weekly" described "Halo" as "an absolutely glorious and perfectly produced track", which had the potential to be as commercially successful as "Crazy in Love" (2003) and "Irreplaceable" (2007). Joey Guerra of the "Houston Chronicle" wrote that it was an immediate standout on "I Am... Sasha Fierce". Praising the "big and wide" melodies of "Halo", Matos Michaelangelo of "The A.V. Club" commented that Beyoncé has "a real flair for grandeur". Jennifer Cady of E! Online wrote that the song could be included on a romantic mixtape, and James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the "tear-jerking power" of "Halo" reveals "sides of Beyoncé we never knew existed". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media wrote that Beyoncé’s vocal delivery was "strident and exposed", reminiscent of Céline Dion's style.
In spite of what he called the "garden-variety lyrics" of the ballad, James Reed of "The Boston Globe" wrote that "Halo" was "the most evocative power ballad" recorded by Beyoncé, comparing it to the work done by American record producer and songwriter Phil Spector on his Wall of Sound mixing board. Critics have highlighted the similarities of "Halo" to Rihanna's "Umbrella" (2007); Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" noted that "Halo" has the same "icy synths, drivetime rock dynamic, and a similar repetitive chorus". This view was echoed by Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News and Brent DiCrescenzo of "Timeout", who viewed "Halo" as a "Bette Midler–level hymn from ['Umbrella'], liftits savior theme". Nick Levine of Digital Spy described "Halo" as a "muscular hybrid" of "Umbrella" and Lewis' "Bleeding Love". David Balls of the same website wrote, "Halo' is a contemporary power ballad in the 'Bleeding Love' mould ... Could Lewis have pulled this off better? Well, that's a matter of opinion of course, but Mrs. Jay-Z doesn't leave much room for improvement."
Awards and recognition.
"Halo" was nominated for Best Single at the 2009 Urban Music Awards, and for Best Love Song at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards. It won Best Song at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2009. The ballad was placed at number seven of "Rap-Up"s list of the 25 best songs of 2009. "Halo" was nominated at the 52nd Grammy Awards, in the categories of Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, winning the latter. It also won Best Foreign Song at the 2010 Croatian Porin Awards. The live version of "Halo", featured on "" (2009), was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized "Halo" as one of the most performed songs of 2009 at the 27th ASCAP Pop Music Awards. On the occasion of Beyoncé’s thirtieth birthday, Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz of "Billboard" magazine placed the ballad at number 18 on their list of Beyoncé’s 30 biggest "Billboard" hits. On "The Village Voice" year-end Pazz & Jop singles list, "Halo" was ranked at numbers 443 and 114 in 2008 and 2009 respectively. In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the song at number three on their list of ten best Beyoncé’s songs writing that other power ballads "don't come more powerful than this one, which finds Beyoncé belting alongside what sounds to be every instrument in the entire world (including a dope one-second drum solo)".
Chart performance.
"Halo" debuted at number 93 in the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart issue dated February 7, 2009. It peaked at number 5 in the chart issue dated May 23, 2009. "Halo"s US success helped Beyoncé achieve more top 10 singles on the Hot 100 chart than any other female artist during 2001–10. After spending 30 weeks in the top 40 of the Hot 100 chart, "Halo" last charted on the week ending August 29, 2009.

Music video.
The accompanying music videos for "Halo" and "Diva" premiered simultaneously on the US iTunes Store on December 23, 2008. Shot in late November 2008 in a SoHo townhouse owned by Beyoncé, the video was directed by Philip Andelman and features actor Michael Ealy as Beyoncé’s love interest. Ealy was happy to work with Beyoncé, as he had loved the song immediately after hearing it. This was the second time he was asked to star in a video for a song by Beyoncé; the first was "Irreplaceable", which he had refused because he did not appreciate its theme and concept. He had advised Beyoncé: "Call me when you have a hero role."
The video, which Beyoncé has considered intimate and romantic, begins as she stands against a wall, illuminated by light that passes through a window. In one scene, Beyoncé’s character, dressed in a skin-tight leotard, performs a dance sequence while her love interest looks down at her from a balcony. According to Michael Slezak of "Entertainment Weekly", the dance routines pay homage to the 1983 romantic drama film "Flashdance". Beyoncé and Ealy later stare adoringly at each other as they snuggle on a sofa. During the climax of the video, Beyoncé is shown underwater, dressed in white, moving slowly upwards. As the chorus begins, she opens her eyes; after Ealy kisses the back of her neck, the pair come face to face in the final scene, in which Beyoncé lies in bed, with Ealy above her. Jennifer Cady of E! Online wrote that the bright shiny lights in the video "make [Beyoncé] look like an angel". Alison Maloney of "The Sun" praised Beyoncé’s "amazing figure". The video was ranked at number 74 on BET's "Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2009" countdown.
An alternate video surfaced online in late May 2010, explaining why Beyoncé’s character was remembering her love interest in the original version. It begins with a view of the night sky and many trees, as Beyoncé drives a car and Ealy's character is chased by the police through a forest. As the video progresses, she parks her car on the side of the road and scenes from the original version are shown. Police dogs eventually catch Ealy's character and attack him savagely. An open bag reveals stolen money, which is dispersed by the wind. At the end of the video, in the forest, Beyoncé finds Ealy lying lifelessly on the ground.
Live performances.
Beyoncé’s first live performance of "Halo" was at the NAACP Awards on February 12, 2009. Wearing a white gown, she sang the ballad while archival footage from the Civil Rights movement was shown on many screens in the background. Brennan Williams of Entertainment Newswire wrote that Beyoncé’s "breathtaking performance" showed why she received the 2009 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Female Artist. She also sang "Halo" on the "Late Show with David Letterman" on April 22, 2009, and on "The Today Show" the following day. The song was later added to the set list of her I Am... Tour in 2009–10, when it was performed during the concert's encore. After Beyoncé finished her "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" performance, she sang "Halo". She initially sang the ballad on stage before descending to shake hands with everybody in the front rows. Deborah McAleese and Lauren Mulvenny of "The Belfast Telegraph" commented that the ballad "was sung with great passion". It was included on her CD/DVD live albums "I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas" and "I Am... World Tour" (2010). Beyoncé performed "Halo" live, as the closing song at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, in front of an audience of more than 175,000. During the ITV special "A Night With Beyoncé", which aired on December 4, 2011 in the UK, she sang the ballad to a selected crowd of fans.
On June 25, 2009, American entertainer Michael Jackson died while Beyoncé was touring. His death led her to perform tributes to Jackson at tour venues, including Atlanta, Georgia on July 1, 2009; and New Orleans, Louisiana on July 3, 2009. During the tribute, an image of Jackson was shown on the main screen. As Beyoncé sang an emotional rendition of "Halo", she changed the lyrics to "Michael I can see your Halo / I pray your music won't fade away". On January 12, 2010, Haiti was struck by an earthquake. A charity telethon called "" took place on January 22, 2010, in which many artists, including Beyoncé, participated. She performed an acoustic version of "Halo" with Coldplay's lead vocalist Chris Martin playing the piano. To make the song match the night's purpose, Beyoncé weaved "Haiti" into its lyrics, singing "Haiti, we can see your halo / You know you're my saving grace / You're everything I need and more, it's written all over your face / Haiti, we can see your halo / I pray you won't fade away". This version was included on the 2010 live album "Hope for Haiti Now".
On February 11, 2012, American recording artist Whitney Houston died. After her death, Beyoncé performed a tribute for Houston during her revue in May, 2012, in Atlantic City, New Jersey at the Revel resort. Wearing a red dress, Beyoncé began the performance of "Halo" singing the first verse of Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You". Maura Johnston of "The Village Voice" praised the performance noting that the song was "given an explosive coda" which showed how "the most basically structured song by one of pop's most template-hewing songwriters... could be turned into something glorious with the right singer." While reviewing the revue, Kyle Anderson of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that "the most attention-grabbing moments of the night... came when she dipped into other artists' catalogs". Ben Ratliff of "The New York Times" mentioned the song in the "almost continuous high point" of the concert. On February 3, 2013, Beyoncé performed the song during the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show. "Halo" was added to the setlist of her The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour.
Cover versions and usage in media.
In 2009, "Halo" was covered by Florence and the Machine on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Elementary school group PS22 chorus covered "Halo" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" during the 2009 "Billboard" Women in Music luncheon held at The Pierre in New York City. At the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, American singer Katy Perry performed a mash-up of "Halo" and the other Best Song nominees. American singer Mike Posner also covered the ballad with different lyrics, and placed it on his 2009 album "A Matter of Time". According to an MTV writer, Posner's rendition was "a refreshing take on the original". David Sides also made a piano cover of the song and released it on his album "The Collection, Vol. 3". "Halo" is featured on the British compilation album "Now! 73". The song was blended with "How to Break a Heart" by the Irish boy band Westlife, on their 2010 Where We Are Tour. On February 5, 2012, the team on the Australian talent show, "Young Talent Time", sang "Halo" as the closing song of that night. On April 17, 2013, Angie Miller, a contestant on the 12th season of "American Idol" covered the song during an episode of the show. Melissa Locker of "Rolling Stone" magazine commented that she was "at her best" and "managed to tap into that power sans piano".
"Halo" has been covered by other musicians, including Ailee, ceo (Eric Berglund) and Harper Blynn. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media has written that no cover has been "quite as inspired or as perversely logical" as the one by ceo. Built essentially on bumpy beats, this version makes use of an acoustic guitar, 1980s-era stylized electric guitar, strings, and horns, and ends with a rapped outro. A dancehall cover of "Halo" by Major Lazer, with lead vocals by Elephant Man, was posted on the former's Twitter account the night after Beyoncé won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2011 Grammy Awards. Simon Vozick-Levinson of "Entertainment Weekly" commented that their version "stays fairly close to the original, except with Elephant Man growling instead of Beyoncé belting the verses". In 2012, Swedish singer Robin Stjernberg, member of the boy band What's Up!, covered the song and included it on his solo debut album "My Versions". In 2013, "Halo" was covered by the Icelandic band Hjaltalín, with their version of "Halo" appearing as the B-side of their single "Crack in a Stone". A gospel-style version of the song was recorded by Jahméne Douglas and was released on his album "Love Never Fails" (2013). Indian singer Sunidhi Chauhan covered "Halo" during a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London in late September 2013. A writer of "The Times of India" included the performance of the song as one of the highlights of the concert.
"Halo" was blended with Katrina and the Waves' 1985 song "Walking on Sunshine", in the "Vitamin D" episode of the Fox Broadcasting Company television show "Glee". Released as a single, this version peaked at number 4 on the Irish Singles Chart, number 8 on the UK Official Download Chart, number 9 on the UK Singles Chart, number 10 on the ARIA Singles Chart, number 28 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart, and number 40 on the Hot 100 chart. It was certified gold by ARIA, denoting shipment of 35,000 copies. The mash-up was included on the set list of the group's debut concert Glee Live! In Concert! (2010–11). "Halo" was included on the international soundtrack of "India – A Love Story", an Emmy-winning Brazilian soap opera.

Ego (Beyoncé song)

"Ego" is a song recorded by American R&B singer Beyoncé Knowles for the deluxe edition of her third studio album, "I Am... Sasha Fierce" (2008). The song was composed by Elvis Williams, Harold Lilly, and Knowles. "Ego" was officially remixed with additional vocals from hip hop artist, Kanye West. Initially planned to be released in January 2010 as the second urban single in the US along with the fourth US and third international single "Halo", the release of "Ego" was canceled and replaced by "Diva". "Ego" was later serviced as the third urban single, and fifth overall single in the US on May 19, 2009 alongside the sixth US and fourth international single "Sweet Dreams".
"Ego" was originally written for singer Chrisette Michele, who turned it down. It was eventually proposed to Knowles who used it for the deluxe edition of "I Am... Sasha Fierce". In the song, Knowles sings about her love for the "huge ego" of her love interest. "Ego" was generally well received by music critics, many of whom praised the fact that Knowles opted to show some of her vocal limitations in a part of the song. Critics also noted that "Ego" could even have been placed in either disc of "I Am.. Sasha Fierce" as it combines elements of both sides of Knowles' split musical personality. The remix version of "Ego" was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 52nd Grammy Awards.
"Ego" became the fifth consecutive song from "I Am... Sasha Fierce" to reach the top 40 on US "Billboard" Hot 100, peaking at 39. It reached number three on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Despite not being released elsewhere, "Ego" reached number 11 in New Zealand and number 60 in the United Kingdom, among others. Its music video was directed by Frank Gatson, Jr, and was co-directed by Knowles herself, thus becoming her directorial debut. A video was also filmed for the remix version of the song with Kanye West. "Ego" was a part of Knowles' set list on her I Am... World Tour (2009–10).
Background and release.
"Ego" was written by Elvis Williams, Harold Lilly and Beyoncé Knowles while production was handled by Williams and Knowles. It was originally written for singer Chrisette Michele for her 2009 album "Epiphany". However, Michele turned it down because she had written all the songs on her then-upcoming album and feared that the song might not suit her. She said, "You don’t know if they’re going to be able to capture your voice the same way that you captured it yourself." "Ego" was eventually proposed to Knowles, who used it for the deluxe edition of "I Am... Sasha Fierce". It was officially remixed with added vocals from Kanye West, whom Knowles described as the "perfect person" to be on the remix. Elaborating on her collaboration with West, she told MTV News, "[Kanye's] voice sounds so wonderful on it. He definitely has the confidence and he backs it up. And that's what this song is about." The remix was included on the 2009 remix album "Above and Beyoncé – Video Collection & Dance Mixes" and the platinum edition of "I Am... Sasha Fierce". Andrew Burgess of musicOMH criticized West's "lackadaisical and disappointing appearance" on the remix.
"Ego" and "Halo" were initially planned for simultaneous release in the US, following the 2008 dual lead singles "If I Were a Boy" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". However, the release of "Ego" was scrapped and replaced with "Diva". "Ego" was later released as the fifth US single to urban contemporary radio on May 19, 2009 and to rhythmic contemporary radio on June 2, 2009 along with "Sweet Dreams". It was at first supposed to be released alongside the sixth US and fourth worldwide single "Broken-Hearted Girl"; however, at the last minute, the release of the latter was scrapped, and "Sweet Dreams" was released instead. Both tracks were taken from the "... Sasha Fierce" disc. This goes in contrast to the previous joint-releases from this album where one track was taken from each disc. "Ego" was additionally released on a digital EP as a B-side single to "Sweet Dreams" on July 31, 2009, in Germany.
Composition.
According to Knowles, "Ego" is an R&B-leaning song with a "fun vibe". It also incorporates influences from bump jazz, soul music, and pop music. The song is built on a punchy beat and its instrumentation includes a backing piano, horns, as well as trumpets and organs. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, "Ego" is written in common time, composed in a moderate tempo, and is set in the key of D Major. The song follows the chord progression of D-Gmaj7-A-A. Critics noted that "Ego" is an homage to "old-school R&B midtempo jams". Joey Guerra of "Houston Chronicle" described the song as a blend of "old-school soul riffs and double entendres".
Lyrically, the song features Knowles as the female protagonist singing about her love for the "huge ego" of her lover. Jay Lustig of New Jersey On-Line further noted that the song may be an insight into Knowles' marriage to Jay-Z. In an interview with Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, Knowles clarified that "Ego" is on the "Sasha Fierce" disc because it is "fun" and very "Sasha Fierce". She further explained that "Ego" reveals the story about someone being "very confident and having swagger when they walk and when they talk, and that being one of the reasons why [she is attracted to them." The song explores the restrained vocals of Knowles singing "I talk like this, cos I can back it up" and consists of a piano breakdown. As Knowles sings, she lets out a slinky snarl in her voice. She describes the ego of her love interest as: "It’s too big, it’s too wide, it’s too strong, it won’t fit, it’s too much." The remix of the song features Kanye West rapping on it. He sings the lines, "Now I’m standing next to Jay, who's standing next to B / Could have been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me / That's good for my ego... My ego is my imaginary friend / He was with me when I was only imagining."
Critical reception.
"Ego" received positive reviews from critics, most of whom wrote that "Ego", which is featured on the "Sasha Fierce" disc, could have also been placed on the "I Am..." disc since the lyrics seem to showcase vulnerability and the desire to be loved back while the music is completely fun like Knowles' alter ego. A writer for "Billboard" magazine gave the song a positive review, writing that "Ego" manages to combine elements of both sides of Knowles' musical personality. He said that the song seems to be an homage to "old-school R&B midtempo jams". He went on to praise Knowles' vocals, which according to him, she did not polish during the interlude, thus showing her real voice and limitations "just like the old days". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine was brief and said that the song could benefit from the first half of the album. Neil McCormick of the "The Daily Telegraph" chose "Ego" as the standout track on "I Am... Sasha Fierce", complimenting its lyrical content and calling it "playful boldness".
Ann Powers of "Los Angeles Times" noted that in "Ego", Knowles shows the spunk she developed playing Etta James in Cadillac Records. IGN Music described the song as one of the "genuine shining moments" where Knowles' voice and the music are perfectly matched. "The Village Voice"'s Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond described "Sasha Fierce" as "brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty" and wrote that all these adjectives suit "Ego". According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, the song seems more like a meeting ground between the album's halves, further writing that it is "musically" with "Sasha", nevertheless thematically and lyrically, it is full-on Knowles; "vulnerable, wanting to love and be loved back". Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented that Knowles is "goddamn fabulous" on "Ego". However, Jim Farber of "Daily News" commented that "'Ego' avoids expectations by celebrating a man's cockiness rather than her [Knowles'] own." The remix version of "Ego" with Kanye West was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards but lost to "Run This Town" sung by Jay-Z featuring Rihanna and West. On "The Village Voice"s 2009 Pazz & Jop singles list, "Ego" was ranked at number 546.
Chart performance.
For the week ending June 20, 2009, "Ego" entered US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart at number 77, becoming Knowles' 19th solo entry on the chart. The song peaked at number 39 after 8 weeks on the chart issue dated August 15, 2009, becoming Knowles' 18th solo top 40 single and the 5th single from "I Am... Sasha Fierce" to crack the top 40. "Ego" fared better on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where it peaked at number three on July 25, 2009, thus charting higher than "If I Were a Boy" and "Halo" on that chart. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and, as of October 6, 2010, has sold 357,000 downloads (excluding remix version) in the US.
Even though "Ego" was only officially released in the US, it still managed to chart in other countries. In New Zealand, the song debuted at number 28 on June 8, 2009, and peaked at number 11 on June 29, 2009, after just three weeks on the chart. Spending ten weeks on the chart, it became the fifth song from "I Am... Sasha Fierce" to chart within the top 40 there. The song was certified gold by Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) on August 7, 2011. "Ego" also bubbled at number two on the Dutch Tip Parade chart, which is equivalent to number 42 on the Dutch Top 40 Singles Chart. The song charted for four weeks on the Swedish Singles Chart, where it peaked at number 29.
"Ego" began to receive mild airplay on UK music channels as of March 2010. Consequently, it debuted at number 153 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 81 on the UK R&B Chart on April 10, 2010. One week later, due to a considerable increase in airplay, it surged to number 60 on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number 23 on the UK R&B Chart. It later managed a better peak at number 22 on the UK R&B Chart on April 24, 2010. "Ego" is the second single from "I Am... Sasha Fierce" to enter both the Top 75 of UK Singles Chart and the Top 25 of the UK R&B Chart without a physical or a digital release, the first being "Diva", which peaked at number 72 on the UK Singles Chart on May 24, 2009.
Music video.
Background and synopsis.
Knowles made her directorial debut on the video for "Ego" with the choreographer Frank Gatson Jr, who had been working with her for twelve years by then, as the creative director. Gatson has been the creative director for many of her videos, such as "Suga Mama", "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", and "Get Me Bodied", as well as her last three world tours, including the I Am... World Tour (2009-2010). Knowles let Gatson direct the video for "Ego" after he introduced her to a new choreographer, Sheryl Murakami. Knowles told "Entertainment Weekly": "My goal for video is simplicity... In 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)', I saw this old tape of Bob Fosse's wife [Gwen Verdon, and I used that as inspiration. I thought in this world, with all the technology and everything that's going on, to strip everything down—great idea. So I kind of did the same thing, but glossy and black, for 'Ego'." 
Like the music videos for "If I Were a Boy", "Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)", and "Diva", the one for "Ego" was shot in black and white. The word "bitch" is muted out when Knowles sings, "I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch!". "Ego" is the first video from "I Am... Sasha Fierce" in which she has curly afro hair, similar to the one in "Work It Out". It is also the first video from the "Sasha Fierce" disc of her album where she does not don her robot-glove. The video features Knowles and her two backup female dancers all dressed in silver leotards and performing similar choreography, which has reminiscence of that of "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". Later, Knowles sits on a white glittery chair in front of the same tiled background; she is wearing black coat and the two dancers are still dancing in unison around her. There are a few shots of her on the chair facing the back of the camera with the dancers doing the same. Knowles then gets up to join the dance being executed by the two female around the chair. This scene ends as they walk to the left of the camera, into the next scene. Knowles is still with the tiled background. She and her dancers are now holding poles as props with which they dance. During the same pole scene, some shots of her singing in the chair are intercut. In the next scene, with the same tiled background, Knowles is leaning against the wall as the bridge of the song has been reached. Her dancers spin in heels around her, and they all then continue to dance against the wall. The last scene shows Knowles in the chair, without the black jacket and still dancing until the song ends.
Release and reception.
A "bootlegged" version of the music video, featuring Sheryl Murakami performing the choreography, was leaked onto YouTube in early March 2009. In the B-roll footage on "Above and Beyoncé", it was shown that a clay sculpture of Knowles was made for the video of "Ego". However, the sculpture was not shown in the final version of the video. Three edits exist for the "Ego" music video: an official video, a remix video featuring Kanye West, and a fan-exclusive video. The official video premiered on Knowles' official website on May 21, 2009. The remix music video, which features a cameo appearance of Kanye West, was included on the remix album with videography "Above and Beyoncé – Video Collection & Dance Mixes". It premiered on the June 15, 2009, episode of BET's "Access Granted". In the remix video, Kanye West begins his rap in an empty room next to a follow spot. At the end of his rap, he points the light towards the camera and the shot fades in white to Knowles' scenes. The rest of the video is nearly identical to the original video. Mark Richardson of Pitchfork Media commented that the video shows "in-your-face Kanye spitting before Beyoncé shows off some of her 'Single Ladies' moves." It was ranked at number 38 on BET's "Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2009" countdown. A fan-exclusive version of "Ego" was included on "Above and Beyoncé", in which only Knowles appears. The whole video is a continuous double-angled scene where she is seated on the throne chair previously seen in the original video.
Upon its release, the music video for "Ego" received mixed reviews from music critics who noted similarities with the one for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". A writer of "Rap-Up" magazine described the video as "Single Ladies (Part 2)". Tracey Ford of AOL described the video as "an ode to multiple personalities, leotards and all things 'diva.'" Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented that the video would divide critics' opinions whether it is "a sexy, burlesque-inspired variation on the theme established in the other two videos from the "Sasha Fierce" side of the album, or just a 'Single Ladies' retread with more crotch and rump". Leah Greenblatt of the magazine "Entertainment Weekly" gave a negative review for the video, saying that it was very similar to the one for "Single Ladies" noting "[the music video for 'Ego' feels an awful like the (admittedly awesome) 'Single Ladies' with a spiral perm." Tamar Anitai of MTV was also negative towards the video for the song, writing that it looks like a dress rehearsal of the video for "Single Ladies" but "in drag". She further wrote, "Anyway, while the '80s horns-and-organ vibe delivers some throwback flavor, I'm not feeling the circa-2002-Christina-Aguilera curly wig or the satin prom gloves. And the boob grabbing is a little too gratuitous. And when Beyonce says 'It's too big, it's too wide, it's too strong, it won't fit, it's too much,' I'm not even positive that she's really referring to an ego." Nadia Mendoza of "The Sun" noted that Knowles' appeal is "fast disppearing the more she morphs into alter ego Sasha Fierce" further describing the dance moves in the video as "bizarre". She finished her review by writing, "warbles along to her track while shaking her booty in a not very flattering leotard in a similar vein to the iconic Single Ladies vid[eo. But unfortunately for her, Ego is not half as catchy."
Live performances.
Knowles performed "Ego" as part of the set list during her world tour, the I Am... World Tour (2009). When she performed the song live in Seattle before of its release as a single, Kanye West joined her onstage and rapped: "I got a big, ha ha ha, ego / She love my big, ha ha ha, ego / She stroke my big, ha ha ha, ego...". West later made a surprise appearance at Knowles' concert in London on November 14, 2010, where he again rapped his verse. Eventually, the remix of "Ego" was included on Knowles' 2010 live album, "I Am... World Tour" as the fifteenth track. Andy Gill of "The Independent" listed the song as a highlight on the album.

While watching MTV, Hewlett came up with the idea to create the band, and later commented, "if you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell – there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that." Gorillaz is a virtual band represented by four cartoon characters: 2D, Murdoc, Noodle and Russel. They are used in promotional material such as album covers, posters, and in concerts, during which holographic versions of the characters are used. The band's music is a collaboration between various musicians; Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor. Their music has been considered a mix of hip hop, electronica, dub and pop. Gorillaz have released three studio albums, all on the Parlophone and Virgin record labels: "Gorillaz" (2001), "Demon Days" (2005), and "Plastic Beach" (2010).
Gorillaz have received nine BRIT Award nominations: six in 2002, two in 2006 and one in 2011. In 2006, Gorillaz received their only Grammy Award, the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals award for the song "Feel Good Inc." The band has received five nominations from the MTV Europe Music Awards, winning three of them: Best Dance Act and Best Song for "Clint Eastwood" in 2001, and Best Group in 2005. At the MTV Video Music Awards, Gorillaz received both the Best Special Effects and Breakthrough Video awards for "Feel Good Inc." in 2005. Overall, Gorillaz have received 15 awards from 57 nominations.
Mercury Prize Award.
The Mercury Prize are the annual awards by the British Phonographic Industry and British Association of Record Dealers. In 2001, their debut album, "Gorillaz", was nominated for an Mercury Prize, but it was later withdrawn at the band's request. Murdoc Niccals, cartoon bassist of the band, described the nomination as, "It's like carrying a dead albatross round your neck for eternity". This is the only time that Gorillaz has ever withdrawn for an award nomination.

FC Viktoria 09 Urberach

FC Viktoria 09 Urberach is a German association football club from the city of Rödermark, Hesse.
History.
The club was formed on 24 December 1909 but only entered competitive football in 1914.
In the years after the First World War, the club gradually improved, opening its new playing field in 1921 and winning the local cup competition in 1924. In 1926, a first league championship was archived and in 1930, the club won promotion to the "Bezirksliga Main-Hessen", then the highest football league in the region, where it competed with clubs like FSV Mainz 05 and Wormatia Worms. "Viktoria" spent the next three seasons in this league but in 1933, when the new "Gauliga" system was introduced, it failed to make the cut for the "Gauliga Südwest/Mainhessen".
After the Second World War, the club quickly returned to its status as a strong local amateur side, earning promotion to the "Bezirksklasse Darmstadt" in 1948. The club then proceeded to the "2nd Amateurliga Hessen", from where it gained promotion to the "Hessenliga" (III) in 1957, the highest league in the state.
In 1958, the club won the "Hesse Cup" and finished third in the "Hessenliga", a strong achievement for the newly promoted side. "Viktoria" however could not maintain this quality of play and quickly slipped to the bottom half of the table in the coming seasons, resulting in relegation in 1961, when it was even placed behind local rival "KSV Urberach".
The club was not part of the new "Landesliga Hessen-Süd" in 1965, when it was formed as the tier below the "Amateurliga Hessen". Instead, a long spell in the lower amateur leagues followed which was only broken in 2002, when the club archived promotion to the "Bezirksoberliga Darmstadt" (VI). From there, it moved up to the "Landesliga Hessen-Süd" in 2005. After two seasons of mid-table finishes in this league, the club earned promotion to the "Hessenliga" in 2008 on the strength of a second place, returning to the highest amateur league in Hesse for the first time in 47 years.
The club achieved an impressive start to the 2008–09 season and was leading the "Hessenliga" after 15 rounds despite having played two games less than most of the other teams. Its performance weakened somewhat after that but it nevertheless finished in a very respectable third place. 
On 12 October 2008, "Viktoria's" goalkeeper Jürgen Hoffelner collided with a player from the opposition team, 1. FC Eschborn, and had to be saved by the team doctor from suffocating due to having swallowed his own tongue and was taken to the hospital in Frankfurt, where he was put into an artificial coma. The game was cancelled by the referee after this incident.
At the end of the 2012-13 season the club was relegated in unfortunate circumstances, having had to deregister its reserve team during the season and being consequently deducted six point for this breech of rules, which pushed the club onto a relegation rank.

Barnstokkr

In Norse mythology, Barnstokkr (Old Norse, literally "child-trunk") is a tree that stands in the center of King Völsung's hall. Barnstokkr is attested in chapters 2 and 3 of the "Völsunga saga", written in the 13th century from earlier tradition, partially based on events from the 5th century and the 6th century, where, during a banquet, a one-eyed stranger appears and thrusts a sword into the tree which only Sigmund is able to pull free. Scholarly theories have been put forth about the implications of Barnstokkr and its relation to other trees in Germanic paganism.
"Völsunga saga".
Barnstokkr is introduced in chapter 2 of "Völsunga saga" where King Völsung is described as having "had an excellent palace built in this fashion: a huge tree stood with its trunk in the hall and its branches, with fair blossoms, stretched out through the roof. They called the tree Barnstokk".
In chapter 3, King Völsung is holding a marriage feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King Völsung's hall. At the hall, large fires are kindled in long hearths running the length of the hall, while in the middle of the hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it into the trunk of the tree, and the blade sinks to its hilt. Words of welcome fail the crowd.
The tall stranger says that he who draws the sword from the trunk shall receive it as a gift, and he who is able to pull free the sword shall never carry a better sword than it. The old man leaves the hall, and nobody knows who he was, or where he went. Everyone stands, trying their hand at pulling free the sword from the trunk of Barnstokkr. The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had lay loose for him—he draws it from the trunk. The saga then continues.
Theories.
Hilda Ellis Davidson draws links to the sword placed in Barnstokkr to marriage oaths performed with a sword in pre-Christian Germanic societies, noting a potential connection between the carrying of the sword by a young man before the bride at a wedding as a phallic symbol, indicating an association with fertility. Davidson cites records of wedding ceremonies and games in rural districts in Sweden involving trees or "stocks" as late as the 17th century, and cites a custom in Norway "surviving into recent times" for "the bridegroom to plunge his sword into the roof beam, to test the 'luck' of the marriage by the depth of the scar he made".
Davidson points out a potential connection between the descriptor "apaldr" (Old Norse "apple tree") and the birth of King Völsung, which is described earlier in the "Völsunga saga" as having occurred after Völsung's father Rerir sits atop a burial mound and prays for a son, after which the goddess Frigg has an apple sent to Rerir. Rerir shares the apple with his wife, resulting in his wife's long pregnancy. Davidson states that this mound is presumably the family burial mound, and proposes a link between the tree, fruit, mound, and the birth of a child.
Davidson opines that Siggeir's anger at his inability to gain the sword that Odin has plunged into Barnstokkr at first sight appears excessive, and states that there may be an underlying reason for Siggeir's passionate desire for the sword. Davidson notes that the gift of the sword was made at a wedding feast, and states that Barnstokkr likely represents the 'guardian tree', "such as those that used to stand beside many a house in Sweden and Denmark, and which was associated with the 'luck' of the family", and that the 'guardian tree' also had a connection with the birth of children. Davidson cites Jan de Vries in that the name "barnstokkr" "used in this story was the name given to the trunk of such a tree because it used to be invoked and even clasped by the women of the family at the time of childbirth."
Providing examples of historical structures built around trees, or with 'guardian trees' around or in the structure in Germanic areas, Davidson states that the "'luck' of a family must largely depend on the successful bearing and rearing of sons, and there is a general belief that when a guardian tree is destroyed, the family will die out." In connection with this, Davidson theorizes that at the bridal feast, it should have been Siggeir, the bridegroom, who drew the sword from the tree, "and that its possession would symbolize the 'luck' which would come to him with his bride, and the successful continuation of his own line in the sons to be born of the marriage". The sword having been refused to him, Davidson theorizes that this may well have been intended as a deadly insult, and that this lends a tragic air to the scene in the hall.
Jesse Byock (1990) states that the name "Barnstokkr" may not conceivably be the original name of the tree, and instead that it is possible that it may have originally been "bran(d)stokkr", the first part of the compound potentially having been "brandr", (meaning "brand" or "firebrand"), a word sometimes synonymous with "hearth", and pointing to a potential connection to the fire burning within the hall. Byock notes that the tree is called an "eik" (Old Norse "oak"), which has an unclear meaning as the Icelanders often employed the word as a general word for "tree", and the tree is also referred to as "apaldr", which is also a general term used to refer to trees. Byock theorizes that the latter reference to an apple tree may imply a further symbolic meaning pointing to the apple tree of the goddess Iðunn, and that the Barnstokkr may be further identified with the world tree Yggdrasil.
Andy Orchard (1997) states that the role and placement of Barnstokkr as a "mighty tree, supporting and sprouting through the roof of Völsung's hall" has clear parallels in Norse mythology with the world tree Yggdrasil, particularly in relation to Yggdrasil's position to the hall of Valhalla. Orchard further points out parallels between Sigurd's ability to solely remove the sword from the trunk and King Arthur's drawing of the sword Excalibur.
Modern influence.
In Richard Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen" opera cycle, the tree appears as "Barnstock", when the hero Siegmund, with a great tug, pulls from it a sword that he names Nothung. Barnstokkr has been theorized as English author and philologist J. R. R. Tolkien's immediate source for a scene in his 1954 work "The Lord of the Rings" depicting the fictional character of Frodo Baggins and his acceptance of the weapon Sting after it has been thrust "deep into a wooden beam". Some of the structures described in Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" have been described as "recalling" the position and placement of Barnstokkr in "Völsunga saga", which Tolkien was well familiar with.

The Henschel Quartet is a German string quartet comprising the Henschel siblings; Christoph and Markus (violinists; born 17 September 1969), Monika (violist; born 8 August 1968) and Mathias Beyer-Karlshøj (cellist), who joined them in 1994.
Musical Training.
Christoph, Markus and Monika Henschel studied with Felix Andrievsky, a graduate of the Moscow Violin School of playing (Yampolsky and Yankelevich) and gained distinction in their diplomas from the Royal College of Music, in London. Mathias Beyer-Karlshøj studied with the Swedish cellist Thorleif Thedeen and gained a distinction in 1996, at the end of his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen.
An intensive musical experience was gained through their contact with Sergiu Celibidache and with Prof. Franz Beyer from the Musikhochschule in Munich. The London Master Classes and classes at the Musikhochschule in Cologne, Germany with the Amadeus Quartet had a determining influence on the musical development and direction of the ensemble. Similarly, regular courses with members of the La Salle Quartet and Alban Berg Quartet had a profound influence on the Henschel Quartet. The Henschel Quartet were quartet in residence at both the Aldeburgh Festival (1994) and at the Tanglewood Music Festival (1995/1996). At the latter, they were coached by musicians Louis Krasner and Eugene Lehner, who had worked with composers such as Béla Bartók and Arnold Schönberg, and who gave the quartet unique insights into the works of the Second Viennese School. 
Repertoire and Première Performances.
The Henschel Quartet’s repertoire encompasses more than 200 works from the classical and romantic to 20th century and contemporary music.
The quartet has given many première performances of works of contemporary composers from Günter Bialas to Manfred Trojahn and played premières of recently discovered works of famous past composers:
Awards and achievements.
The Henschel Quartet has worked for the German Music Council and the Siemens Arts Programme and regularly takes part in their programmes at the Goethe Institutes abroad.
The quartet belongs to the select group of guest ensembles who regularly play at the Spanish royal palace in Madrid and perform concerts on the 4 Stradivarius instruments that belong to the palace.
CD Recordings.
The Henschel Quartet have received noteworthy praise, nominations and awards for their CD recordings of the classical and romantic repertoire with SonyBMG, EMI and Deutsche Grammophon, including: 
Since 2007, the quartet has performed 20th century works and made premières recordings for the newly formed CD label NEOS, including pieces by amateur composers Derek Smith, Earl Reisdorff, Andy Evans and Roland Fudge (Competition Winners in 2009 BBC Music Magazine competition). 
Teaching Commitments/Engagements.
Since 1998 the Henschel Quartet has given regular masterclasses at universities and music departments such as MIT, Boston, Dartington College of Arts, England, and the University of Melbourne, Australia.
Moreover, the Henschel Quartet is engaged in exchanges with other ensembles and strives to reach new levels of artistic excellence in chamber music. Together with Franz Preuschoff as the official organiser, the quartet has, since 1997, invited a new colleague ensemble to perform each year in their string festival at the Kloster Seligenstadt.
Since its beginning, the quartet has committed itself to supporting children and young people. The non-profit organisation “Friends of the Henschel Quartet for the promotion of chamber music” has been dedicating itself, since 2001 not only to the support of youth, but also to the expansion of the chamber music scene. 
As ambassadors for SOS Children’s Villages Association, the Henschel Quartet organises workshops and concerts for children and youth, and have made a CD Recording in aid of the SOS children’s villages.

Jack Smith (Scottish footballer)

John Reid "Jack" Smith (2 April 1895 – September 1946) was a Scottish footballer, who played as a centre forward and helped Bolton Wanderers win the FA Cup in 1923 and 1926.
Football career.
Smith was born in Pollokshaws, to the south of Glasgow and played youth football with Battlefield Juniors, before joining Albion Rovers. From there he moved on to Kilmarnock, where he scored seven of their 14 goals on the way to winning the Scottish Cup in 1920, including scoring the third goal for Kilmarnock in the final when they defeated his former team, Albion Rovers, 3–2.
Following a disagreement with Kilmarnock, Smith joined Cowdenbeath, where during 1921–22, he netted 45 goals as they finished runners-up in Division Two. At the season's end he joined Rangers for £3,000, making his debut at Ibrox Park on 15 August 1922, scoring in a 2–0 victory over Alloa Athletic. He only made two further appearances for Rangers, scoring once more, before losing his place to Geordie Henderson. Bolton Wanderers signed him three months later.
Smith arrived at Burnden Park in November 1922 as a replacement centre-forward for Frank Roberts who had joined Manchester City. He scored an 89th-minute winner on his debut, against Manchester City, but quickly became thought of as a "crock", for he always appeared to be limping. Despite this, he managed to get his fair share of goals, scoring 21 goals in 35 games in the 1924–25 season, thus helping Bolton to finish in third place in the First Division table. 
He netted Bolton's second goal in the 1923 FA Cup Final against West Ham United. The goal was scored in controversial circumstances when outside-forward Ted Vizard played the ball into a central position and Smith hit the ball past Hufton in the West Ham goal. West Ham's players claimed that the ball had not entered the goal but rebounded into play from the goalpost, but referee D. H. Asson overruled them, stating that in his view the ball had entered the goal but then rebounded off a spectator. 
Smith won another winners' medal in 1926 in a 1–0 victory over Manchester City. After the arrival of Harold Blackmore, Smith found it difficult to hold his place in the first team, and in March 1928, Bury paid £1,500 for him. "The Shakers" were still in the First Division and Smith netted a hat-trick on his debut against Sheffield Wednesday. At Bury he scored 107 goals in 157 League games before joining Rochdale in August 1933. 
In 1939 he was appointed assistant trainer at Cardiff City, who were managed by another ex-Wanderer, Bill Jennings. 
Smith died at Whitchurch, Cardiff in September 1946.

Helping Hands (film)

Helping Hands is a 1941 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by Edward Cahn. It was the 201st "Our Gang" short (202nd episode, 113th talking short, 114th talking episode, and 33rd MGM produced episode) that was released.
Plot.
Spanky receives a letter from his recently drafted older brother. Inspired by the letter's patriotic sentiments, Spanky and the gang organize a "home guard," prepared to do battle should the Nazis invade California. This attracts the attention of Army Major Sanford, who informs the kids that they would be of even greater service to Uncle Sam by looking out for fire hazards, collecting scrap metal and paper, and encouraging their parents to buy war stamps and bonds.
Note.
The film marked the first of the wartime propaganda-themed shorts in the "Our Gang" series. Critics and fans both have cited that the wartime films marked a noticeable decline in the series.

Mamuka Japharidze

Mamuka Japharidze (born 1962) is a notable artist from the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi. He is especially known for representing Georgia in the 48th Venice Biennale. He currently lives in Tbilisi and produces his art there.
Early life.
Mamuka Japharidze was born in 1962 and raised in Tbilisi with his sister. His career was encouraged by his father, Jemali Japaridze, also an artist. He often collaborates with his artist and writer partner, Anthea Nicholson. He spends much of his time in England.
Philosophy and targets.
In 2003, he said:
"Since 1987 I have been working in an international arena; working with language; using language frame as the basic construction and conceptual base of a work. Often using bi-lingual sound-play to find new trans-cultural subjective meanings. The poetic language sound-play can be manifested as sound vibration, concrete text and also the actual object/event itself.<br>
I am investigating the way that objects exist in a separate time/world beyond human´s utilitarian interpretation of time/object. The state of potential before objects/things are manifested is for me a real metaphysical state of existence. The idea of the object exists in ancient mythological dialogue and drama, which for me is still present. When the utilitarian conception of an object is cleared away, the deep metaphysical meaning is revealed.<br>
One basic principle is an investigation of the threshold between an art event and ´non art´. And how the four-dimensional (space, time/metaphysical) aspects of the work in the actual moment of the event, are for me the deep points of realisation.<br>
My target is the actual moment of an event and not towards building a product.<br>
The medium is changeable and includes: media production, e.g. posters, cards (as part of an art work/event); happenings/public events; collecting and archiving images over long periods of time; video projection; photography; printmaking; texts; drawing; sound works."

Purity in Buddhism

Purity ("suddha") is an important concept within much of Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, although the implications of the resultant moral purification may be viewed differently in the varying traditions. The aim is to purify the personality of the Buddhist practitioner so that all moral and character defilements and defects ("kleshas" such as anger, ignorance and lust) are wiped away and Nirvana can be obtained.
Theravada Understanding of Purity.
Theravada Buddhism regards the path of self-purification as absolutely vital for the reaching of nibbana/nirvana. The main task of the Theravada Buddhist monk is to eradicate moral and character flaws through meditation and moral cultivation, in alliance with the cultivation of insight ("panna"/ "prajna"), so that the purity of nibbana can be achieved. So important is this notion of purity in Theravada Buddhism that the famed Buddhist monk and commentator, Buddhaghosa, composed a central thesis on dhamma (Buddhism) called "The Path of Purity" ("Visuddhi-magga").
Mahayana Understanding of Purity.
Tathagatagarbha.
Controversially, according to the Mahayana Tathagatagarbha sutras, the unsullied essence or "true self" (also termed the Buddha nature) of the being can be laid bare and become manifest once the temporary and superficial contaminants (kleshas) have been eradicated from its presence.
These contaminants are seen as extrinsic to, rather than inherent within, the essence of the being.
The resulting Buddha (after the kleshas have been eliminated) is referred to in the Tathagatagarbha literature and in the works of the Tibetan Jonangpa lama Dolpopa as the 'pure Self'.
Perfection of Wisdom.
The Perfection of Wisdom sutras of Mahayana Buddhism, in contrast, would ultimately view both impurity and purification as illusory, without any basis to either. Neither has an enduring essence and so is not truly 'fake', according to these ideas, but is merely a name or concept. Nevertheless, these scriptures do teach the need to detach from all moral defilements if Buddhahood is to be reached for the sake of awakening all sentient beings.

System area code

In air traffic control, the system area code (SAC) is part of a unique identifier assigned to each system which uses the ASTERIX format. The Eurocontrol SuRveillance Data Exchange Task Force (RDE-TF) maintains these identifiers internationally and assigns them to regions such as countries, though sometimes more than one code is assigned within the same country, for example to distinguish between civilian and military uses. 
Within each country, it is the responsibility of the relevant air navigation service provider to allocate a system identification code (SIC); up to 256 of them for each SAC.
In the Asterix protocol the SAC/SIC identifies the actual sensor from where the radar information is sent.

Alan Garrett Anderson

Sir Alan Garrett Anderson, (9 March 1877 – 4 May 1952) was a British civil servant and shipowner.
Early life and career.
Anderson was born in 1877 to James George Skelton Anderson and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson. Anderson's father was a shipping magnate who merged the family shipping business, Anderson, Anderson & Co., with Frederick Green & Co. on 12 February 1878 to create the Orient Steam Navigation Company. Anderson's mother was the first British woman in England to qualify as a doctor. He was one of three children born to the couple. One of his sisters, Louisa Garrett Anderson, followed in her mother's footsteps and became a doctor herself, serving during World War I as the head of a military hospital, while Anderson joined his father in the family's shipping enterprise in 1897. Prior to joining the company, Anderson was educated at Eton College (1890 and 1895) and Trinity College, Oxford (1896). Once established in the shipping industry, Anderson expanded into the related field of rail transport, becoming director of Midland Railway in 1911, a seat he maintained through the merger of that railway in 1923 into London, Midland and Scottish Railway.
First World War.
Anderson utilized his business experiences internationally in service of the government during the First World War. Appointed vice-chairman of the Royal Commission responsible for regulating the distribution of wheat supplies, he dealt generally with Great Britain's western allies. He dealt specifically with the United States first in processing enemy cargo aboard US vessels under Walter Runciman and, after the US entered the war, in marketing wheat in the United States as well as Canada along with Arthur Balfour.
In the summer of 1917, Anderson was appointed to replace Eric Geddes as Admiralty controller, a position that made him one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.</ref> During Geddes' term, the Controller had been put in charge of overseeing construction and repairs of both the Royal and Merchant navies, which were taking a toll from submarine attacks. Geddes had set very high quotas for production that the Controller's office, even with delegation, was unable to meet both from shortage of materials and manpower. Tensions were high on both sides, with Joseph Davies specifying his irritation with Anderson, while Anderson, in response to one notable shortage of shipbuilders in November 1917, chided the military for "a complete lack of sense of proportion", suggesting that recruitment would be more successfully accomplished by appealing to wives and union officials in towns known for shipbuilding than seeking the Home Office. Anderson resigned from the position in 1918.
In spite of these challenges, Anderson was widely honored. In 1917, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), an Officer of the Légion d'honneur, and an Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy in reward for his wartime services.
Post-war career.
After the war, Anderson continued to broaden his career. He became known as a powerful figure in the world of finance. Though inexperienced in banking, he became involved with the Bank of England, serving on its board from 1918 to 1946, and serving as its deputy governor under Sir Montagu Norman from 1925-1926. Prior to assuming the latter role, as deputy governor-elect, Anderson accompanied Norman in December 1924 to New York to help determine the feasibility of a resumption of the gold standard. He spoke at the International Chamber of Commerce congress in 1927 as acting president, giving an "eloquent" speech on tariff reductions. From 1927 until 1952, he was a board member of the Suez Canal Company.
His shipping concerns, too, broadened. From its formation in 1878, the Orient Steam Navigation Company had been operated under the co-management of Anderson, Anderson & Co. and Frederick Green & Co, but in 1919 a controlling interest in the Orient Steam Navigation Company was purchased by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O). At that time, Anderson, Anderson and Co. was merged with F. Green and Co. into Anderson, Green & Co., and Anderson was made a board member of both P&O and the British-India Steam Navigation Company by James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape.
In addition, Anderson continued public service. According to his "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" entry, "he chaired two government inquiries, one on the training of naval officers, the other on the pay of civil servants, and was a member of the royal commission into national debt." He was involved with the hospital named in honour of his mother, being shown as one of the owners of the freehold in May 1923, and remained active in the London School of Medicine for Women and the Royal Free Hospital which his mother had helped found.
Anderson was granted an honorary commission as a captain in the Royal Naval Reserve on 28 June 1930. He was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 1934 King's Birthday Honours.
Member of Parliament and Second World War.
In 1935, Anderson ran for public office as a Conservative candidate to represent the City of London as a Member of Parliament (MP). He was first elected at a by-election in June 1935 and was re-elected in that year's general election in November. He resigned in 1940 and focused his efforts on helping his country through World War II. The British Ministry of Food had established a Cereals Control Board following the Munich Crisis in 1938 and placed Anderson to serve as its chairman. In August, 1941, he became the Controller of Railways and the chairman of the Railway Executive. He served as Honorary Colonel of a Territorial Army unit of the Gloucestershire Regiment for a period up to 27 September 1949, retaining the honorary rank of colonel afterwards.
Personal life.
On 9 June 1903, Anderson wed Muriel Ivy Duncan of Surrey. The couple parented four children, including Sir Donald Forsyth Anderson who followed his father into the shipping industry. He died on 4 May 1952.

Joe the Plumber

Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher (; born December 3, 1973), better known by the nickname "Joe the Plumber", is an American conservative activist and commentator. He gained national attention during the 2008 U.S. presidential election when, during a videotaped campaign stop in Ohio by then Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama, Wurzelbacher asked Obama about his small business tax policy. Obama's response included the statement, "when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody." Obama's response was seized upon by conservative media, as well as by Obama's rival, Republican nominee Senator John McCain, as an indication that Obama was interested in the redistribution of wealth, and had a socialist view of the economy. Wurzelbacher is a member of the Republican Party.
Since he expressed to then Senator Obama that he was interested in purchasing a small plumbing business, Wurzelbacher was given the moniker "Joe the Plumber" by the McCain–Palin campaign. The campaign subsequently took him to make several appearances in campaign events in Ohio and McCain often referenced "Joe the Plumber" in campaign speeches and in the final presidential debate, as a metaphor for middle-class Americans.
Wurzelbacher became a conservative activist, commentator, author and motivational speaker. In 2012, he ran on the Republican ticket to represent Ohio's 9th congressional district in the House of Representatives, losing to Democratic incumbent Marcy Kaptur.
Early life, education, and business career.
Wurzelbacher was born in Toledo, Ohio, to Kay and Frank Wurzelbacher. The family moved to Florida when he was young, then returned to Toledo when he was in the middle of high school. After high school, Wurzelbacher enlisted in the United States Air Force, and was stationed in Alaska and North Dakota. In the Air Force, he learned plumbing, along with other skills. Wurzelbacher left the Air Force in 1996 and worked as a plumber, but then switched careers and started working at the telecommunications company Global Crossing. He also married, had a son, and then divorced during this time. After the divorce, Wurzelbacher decided to go back into plumbing in order to spend more time with his son.
2008 presidential election.
Encounter with Barack Obama.
On October 12, 2008, three days before the final presidential debate, Obama met residents in Wurzelbacher's Ohio neighborhood. Wurzelbacher, who had been playing football with his son in his front yard at the time, asked Obama about his tax plan. Wurzelbacher suggested that Obama's tax plan would be at odds with "the American dream." Wurzelbacher said, "I'm getting ready to buy a company that makes 250 to 280 thousand dollars a year. Your new tax plan's going to tax me more, isn't it?"
Obama responded with an explanation of how his tax plan would affect a small business in this bracket. Obama said, "If you're a small business, which you would qualify, first of all, you would get a 50 percent tax credit so you'd get a cut in taxes for your health care costs. So you would actually get a tax cut on that part. If your revenue is above 250, then from 250 down, your taxes are going to stay the same. It is true that, say for 250 up — from 250 to 300 or so, so for that additional amount, you’d go from 36 to 39 percent, which is what it was under Bill Clinton."
Obama also said, "It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success, too… My attitude is that if the economy’s good for folks from the bottom up, it’s gonna be good for everybody. If you’ve got a plumbing business, you’re gonna be better off [...] if you’ve got a whole bunch of customers who can afford to hire you, and right now everybody’s so pinched that business is bad for everybody and I think when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody."
Presidential debate.
During the third and final Presidential debate on October 15, 2008, at Hofstra University, many references were made to "Joe the Plumber." In the debate, McCain repeatedly brought up "Joe the Plumber" and Obama and McCain then made statements aimed directly at Wurzelbacher. As a result, subsequent media attention was directed at Wurzelbacher.
After the debate, Wurzelbacher did not declare his vote for either candidate. He expressed concern that Obama's plans were "one step closer to socialism." Obama's running mate Joe Biden argued that 98% of small businesses take in less than $250,000 a year in income and thus wouldn't be subject to higher taxes under Obama's plan. McCain stated that Wurzelbacher would see higher taxes under Obama's plan.
2008 media appearances.
Wurzelbacher spoke to Katie Couric of "CBS Evening News" on October 15, shortly after the conclusion of the final debate. Asked whether Obama's proposed $250,000 tax threshold would affect him, Wurzelbacher replied: "Not right now at presently, but (...) he's going to do that now for people who make $250,000 a year. When's he going to decide that $100,000 is too much? (...) You're on a slippery slope here. You vote on somebody who decides that $250,000 and you're rich? And $100,000 and you're rich? (...) Where does it end?" He also said, “I asked the question but I still got a tap dance ...almost as good as Sammy Davis, Jr.”
Wurzelbacher held a press conference at his home on the morning of October 16, following the debates, where he refused to express support for either candidate. "I'm not telling anybody anything" about which candidate he prefers, he said, adding, "It's a private booth. I want the American people to vote for who they want to vote for."
On October 16, Wurzelbacher appeared on "Your World with Neil Cavuto" on Fox News. Neil Cavuto asked if Wurzelbacher was persuaded by Obama's plan. Wurzelbacher said that he was not and that he was more frightened upon hearing it. Wurzelbacher suggested that Obama's plan was socialist in nature.
That same day, Wurzelbacher also appeared on "Good Morning America". Diane Sawyer asked him if he was taking home $250,000 now, Wurzelbacher said with a laugh "No, not even close." Sawyer asked Wurzelbacher, "And the McCain camp, some people have said did they contact you and tell you that you were going to be a major part of this, and had they contacted you before that encounter with Senator Obama?" Wurzelbacher answered, "Oh no, no, no one's contacted me as far as if I was going to be on the debate or as far as my name being used. No. I have been contacted by them and asked to show up at a rally. But, other than that, no. I just happened to be here and Barack Obama happened to show up."
On November 2, Wurzelbacher appeared again on "Your World with Neil Cavuto", where he expressed concern that Barack Obama's tax plans would go down "a slippery slope" and eventually raise his taxes. Wurzelbacher also questioned Obama's patriotism saying "there's too many questions with Barack Obama, and his loyalty to our country."
References on the campaign trail.
On October 18, McCain told a campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida that he had phoned Wurzelbacher for the first time on October 17. McCain said, "He's a great guy, proud of his grandfather who served in the US Marine Corps. We're going to fight for Joe, my friends, we are going to fight for him. The question Joe asked about our economy is important, because Senator Obama's plan would raise taxes on small businesses that employ 16 million Americans. Senator Obama's plan will kill those jobs at just the time when we need to be creating more jobs. My plan will create jobs, and that's what America needs."
The McCain-Palin campaign's senior strategist Steve Schmidt said that John McCain's strategy in the final weeks of the presidential campaign was based primarily on his differences with Obama on economic issues, which they would continue to highlight through the story of Joe the Plumber.
After the final presidential debate, McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin frequently repeated the charge in campaign speeches that "Joe the Plumber" would pay higher taxes under Obama and Biden's plan, although according to tax analysts neither Wurzelbacher nor the company he works for would actually be subject to higher taxes under Obama's tax plan. Obama's "spread the wealth around" quote was later used by the McCain campaign, comparing the Democratic policies to socialism. McCain said, " wants government to take Joe's money and give it to somebody else." Obama said in a campaign rally on October 24 that McCain was "not fighting for Joe the Plumber. He's fighting for Joe the Hedge Fund Manager... He likes to talk about Joe the Plumber but he's in cahoots with Joe the CEO." Obama then promoted a plan for middle-class tax cuts and "asked for a show of hands at the rally in the Richmond Coliseum from those making less than $250,000. Nearly all of the 13,000 people raised their hands."
Aides to the McCain-Palin campaign said on October 24 that they would "spend heavily" on a new TV advertisement invoking Wurzelbacher's nickname. The ad would feature "several different people looking into the camera and saying, 'I'm Joe the Plumber.' One man accuses Obama of wanting to use the man's 'sweat to pay for his trillion dollars in new spending. McCain also ran several other commercials with this theme.
Joint appearances with John McCain.
On October 30, Wurzelbacher made appearances with John McCain during Ohio campaign stops in Sandusky, Elyria, and Mentor. In Sandusky, McCain accused the Obama campaign of attacking Wurzelbacher, and in Mentor, Wurzelbacher was allowed to address the crowd, saying, "Once you find out the facts, they become quite obvious," while pointing at McCain.
Earlier in the day, at a rally in Defiance, Ohio, McCain thought that Wurzelbacher was supposed to be in the crowd and called for him to stand up. When it became clear that Joe wasn't in attendance, McCain ended the silence by telling the whole crowd instead to stand up, stating, "You're all Joe the Plumber."
Post-2008 career and activism.
In 2008, Wurzelbacher signed with a publicity management agent regarding media relationships, including "a possible record deal with a major label, personal appearances and corporate sponsorships."
In November 2008, Wurzelbacher was hired for a series of commercials reminding people to convert analog television to digital. Wurzelbacher was hired to help consumers understand the DTV transition in the United States through a series of videos designed to explain the changeover.
In November 2008, Wurzelbacher began promoting his book "Joe the Plumber: Fighting for the American Dream". Co-written with novelist Thomas Tabback and published by PearlGate Publishing of Austin, Texas, the book addresses Wurzelbacher’s ideas concerning American values. In particular, Wurzelbacher criticizes John McCain and states that he did not want him as the Republican presidential nominee. According to the "Toledo Blade", Wurzelbacher criticized McCain as a candidate, saying that the election was "the lesser of two evils." On December 10, 2008, it was reported that Wurzelbacher also criticized McCain for voting for the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, also known as the bank bailout.
On the issue of taxation, he does not consider himself to be a supporter of either party.
In January 2009, Wurzelbacher became a war correspondent for PJ Media. His first assignment involved visiting Israel for ten days during the Gaza War, with his reporting focusing on the Israeli experience of the conflict.
In May 2009, "Time" magazine reported that Wurzelbacher was quitting the Republican Party.
On June 25, 2009, Wurzelbacher spoke at an event called "Pints and Politics" in Wausau, Wisconsin. During his speech, Wurzelbacher questioned why Chris Dodd hadn't been "strung up" yet. He stated that the Founding Fathers "knew socialism doesn't work. They knew communism doesn't work."
On February 13, 2010, Wurzelbacher attended a political event for Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Sam Rohrer. Speaking to a reporter afterwards, Wurzelbacher said that "McCain was trying to use and accused McCain of having "really screwed [his life up".
In Wisconsin, on February 2011, he spoke at a counter-demonstration during protests against Governor Scott Walker's attempts to abolish collective bargaining rights of some public employees.
In February 2014 Wurzelbacher took a job at a Jeep plant which required him to be a member of the United Auto Workers. He complained that his colleagues have called him a 'Tea-bagger'.
2012 congressional election.
Draft movement.
After his meeting with Barack Obama, a campaign to draft Wurzelbacher to run for the United States House of Representatives in the 2010 election started with the website joewurzelbacher2010.com. The "Washington Times" and the "Boston Herald" reported that the campaign's goal was to draft Wurzelbacher to run against Rep. Marcy Kaptur of , although the possibility also existed for Kaptur to choose to run for the Senate seat being vacated by George Voinovich. The website was created by Trevor Lair (then-chairman of the Massachusetts College Republicans), Derek Khanna, and the Massachusetts Alliance of College Republicans. It encouraged visitors to sign an online petition that supported Wurzelbacher’s run for office. Laura Ingraham asked Wurzelbacher, on October 24, 2008, if he would run against Kaptur. Wurzelbacher responded that he had considered the run and would be "up for it".
Campaign.
On October 7, 2011, Wurzelbacher filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to challenge Democratic Representative Marcy Kaptur in the 2012 race for Ohio's 9th congressional seat.
In the March 6, 2012 primary, Wurzelbacher gained the nomination as the Republican candidate in the race, defeating challenger Steven Kraus. He ran in the November 2012 general election against Marcy Kaptur, who had previously won the Democratic primary against Dennis Kucinich after the two incumbents' respective Congressional districts were collapsed into one as a result of post-2010 Census redistricting by the state's Republican-controlled legislature. He lost the election, with Kaptur, who had been the heavy favorite, receiving over 70% of the vote.
Controversies.
Plumbing credentials.
Regarding his statement to Barack Obama about intending to buy the plumbing firm that employed him, Wurzelbacher later said that the idea of buying the company was discussed during his job interview six years prior.
According to MSNBC and Fox News, court records show that Wurzelbacher made $40,000 in 2006. Dun & Bradstreet's report estimated that A. W. Newell Corporation, the full corporate name, had $510,000 in annual sales and eight employees.
As part of the background on McCain's use of "Joe the Plumber," several media outlets researched his professional plumbing credentials. One "Toledo Blade" article stated, "Mr. Wurzelbacher said he works under Al Newell’s license, but according to Ohio building regulations, he must maintain his own license to do plumbing work. He is also not registered to operate as a plumber in Ohio, which means he’s not a plumber." "Mr. Joseph manager of the local union said Mr. Wurzelbacher could only legally work in the townships, but not in any municipality in Lucas County or elsewhere in the country." Wurzelbacher has since stated that he is no longer employed at Newell.
Tax controversy.
ABC News reported on October 16, 2008, that there was a judgment lien against Wurzelbacher for non-payment of $1,182 in owed Ohio state income taxes dating to January 2007, but "no action has been taken against him outside of filing the lien." Barb Losie, deputy clerk of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, said that "there is a 99 percent chance doesn't know about the lien, unless he did a credit report or was ready to pay his taxes." While on "Hannity & Colmes", Wurzelbacher stated that he was unaware of the tax lien prior to it being reported in the press. The taxes were paid on November 6.
Database search controversy.
Prior to the 2008 election, Vanessa Niekamp, an employee of Ohio's Department of Job and Family Services, at the behest of its director, Helen Jones-Kelley, used state computers to search for information on Joe Wurzelbacher. On November 20, 2008, Niekamp reported the violation to the State Inspector General. State and local officials completed an investigation into Jones-Kelley's order, concluding that the searches were improper. On December 17, 2008, Jones-Kelley resigned. In response to the event, Republican Ohio state representative Shannon Jones sponsored House Bill 648, which mandates civil and criminal penalties for improper access of personal information on state databases. On January 6, 2009, Governor Ted Strickland signed the legislation, which became effective after 90 days.
On March 5, 2009, on behalf of Joe Wurzelbacher, Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit in a U.S. District Court in Columbus charging that Jones-Kelley and fellow ODJFS employees Fred Williams and Doug Thompson improperly searched "confidential state databases" in an attempt to retaliate against Wurzelbacher's criticism of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. The lawsuit claims that "officials of the State of Ohio violated Mr. Wurzelbacher's constitutional rights," and that "Wurzelbacher suffered emotional distress, harassment, and embarrassment as a result of the search." Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, stated that "no American should be investigated for simply asking a question of a public official." The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages. On August 4, 2010, the U.S District Court in Columbus dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that the state database search didn't amount to a constitutional violation to the right to privacy. "Judicial Watch" stated it will appeal.
On October 14, 2009, the "Columbus Dispatch" reported that, "A former contractor for the Ohio Association of Chiefs of Police has been charged with rummaging through state computers to retrieve confidential information about 'Joe the Plumber.'" The State Highway Patrol has stated that, "this individual has also used a law-enforcement computer network on Oct. 16, 2008 to access personal information about Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher."
Holocaust comments.
In June 2012, Wurzelbacher's election campaign released a video in which he claimed that the implementation of gun control resulted in Europe’s Jews being unable to defend themselves during the Holocaust, explaining that "In 1939, Germany established gun control. From 1939 to 1945, six million Jews and seven million others unable to defend themselves were exterminated." In the same video, Wurzelbacher stated that the implementation of gun control by the Ottoman Empire in 1911 resulted in Armenians being unable to defend themselves against the Armenian Genocide.
The video drew sharp criticism from the National Jewish Democratic Council (NJDC) and Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern.
Wurzelbacher subsequently defended the video, stating that "Different countries around the world have tried to disarm their citizens, and then have tried to exterminate their own now-unarmed citizens. If people are looking to be offended by this video, they are probably serving a political agenda. Unfortunately there are a lot of whiners out there." Wurzelbacher's spokesman, Phil Christofanelli, also defended the video, stating that Wurzelbacher was a "student of history" who knows that the Founding Fathers "understood that the 2nd Amendment was always the people's last defense against tyrannical government."
Illegal immigration remark.
In August 2012, Wurzelbacher drew criticism for a comment he made about illegal immigration. During a campaign rally for Arizona State Senator Lori Klein, Wurzelbacher said, "For years I've said, you know, put a damn fence on the border, going to Mexico and start shooting."
When asked about the comment later, he said that he didn't care about being "politically incorrect." Klein defended Wurzelbacher, telling reporters his comments were just a joke.

He served similarly at National Provident, the Friends' Provident and the Clergy Mutual Life Office. In 1834, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. 
In 1835 he published "A treatise on friendly societies in which the doctrine of the interest of money and the doctrine of probability are applied" through Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, a compilation of information related to the illnesses and mortality rates of the working class of England. According to the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", this treatise "was probably the first rigorous examination of the subject", contributing to the professional success that ultimately led to his being known as "the father of his profession" in the final years of his life. 
As a specialist in the subject, he was a sometimes financial advisor for British government, including Parliament.

Halloween in the Castro

The Halloween celebration held in The Castro district of San Francisco began in the 1940s as a neighborhood costume contest. By the late 1970s, it had shifted from a children's event to a gay celebration that continued to grow into a massive annual street party until 2006 when a shooting wounded nine people and prompted the city to call off the event.
San Francisco's gay Halloween celebration in the early 1960s originally centered around the early gay bars in the Tenderloin district. They had moved there from the North Beach neighborhood which continues to be a magnet for adult entertainment and nightlife. In the late 1960s, the celebration was centered on Grant Avenue in North Beach. From 1970 to 1978, the Halloween celebration was held on Polk Street in Polk Gulch. In 1977 gay-bashers clashed with police and tear-gas was used to disperse the crowds. By 1979, the city's gay village had moved to the Castro and "gay Mardi Gras" followed. The event became known as the leading Halloween celebration in the U.S., where costumes ranged from "the outrageous to the spectacular." By 2002, Halloween crowds had grown to the hundreds of thousands and became difficult to control.
History.
Children's Halloween.
In 1948, Cliff's Variety Store began hosting a children's Halloween festival that featured a costume contest and ice cream-eating contest. By 1979, the Children's Halloween ended as the neighborhood's population shifted from families with children to more single men. But in the mid-90s, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence revived Children's Halloween with an annual party held at the Eureka Valley Recreation Center, including a costume contest and gifts from Cliff's.
Rise of the LGBT population.
Halloween in the Castro was tied to the LGBT culture of San Francisco and began in the 1950-1960s in the Tenderloin/Polk street area of the city where the mainstream gay bars were first centralized. The event traces its history to the ostracism of LGBT people in the first half of the 20th century from mainstream culture which led to community identity and using gay bars as a focal point for socializing, networking and organizing politically. After World War II, in the 1940s, the San Francisco Bay Area became a haven for LGBT military personnel who didn't want to go back to their old lives. In the 1950s, a group of gay bars in San Francisco's Tenderloin area helped create a strip of venues for "sex, drugs and late night fun". There has also been a South-of-Market (SoMa) leather subculture and BDSM bar scene with gay-focussed sex clubs sharing Folsom street, a tradition which is carried on with the annual Folsom Street Fair. The nearby business- and tourist-oriented area, Union Square, was also popular for cruising for sex and was open to gay men whereas the Tenderloin was where drag queens, t-girls and prostitutes of all orientations were known to congregate publicly in the city, because they were unwelcome in gay bars at that time.
Since the end of World War II, the major port city of San Francisco had been home to a sizable number of LGBT people expelled from the military who decided to stay rather than return to their hometowns and face ostracism. In addition to those outed militarily there were arguably many more who successfully remained closeted, left voluntarily when able to or never entered the service in the first place. San Francisco's history as a more pluralistic culture allowed for LGBT people to find employment and housing; being a tourism and entertainment destination also meant that more creative- and service-oriented work was available.
José Sarria and political power.
Activist and openly gay entertainer José Sarria had served in World War II but afterwards when using the GI Bill to earn a degree he dropped out of college because he wouldn't be able to get work as a teacher. "People were living double lives and I didn't understand it. It was persecution. Why be ashamed of who you are?" At his main performing venue at the time, the Black Cat Bar, he would encourage the customers to stick up for their rights. He exhorted the clientele, "There's nothing wrong with being gay–the crime is getting caught", and "United we stand, divided they catch us one by one". At closing time he would call upon patrons to join hands and sing "God Save Us Nelly Queens" to the tune of "God Save the Queen". Sometimes he would bring the crowd outside to sing the final verse to the men across the street in jail, who had been arrested in raids earlier in the night. Speaking of this ritual in the film "", gay journalist George Mendenhall said: It sounds silly, but if you lived at that time and had the oppression coming down from the police department and from society, there was nowhere to turn ... and to be able to put your arms around other gay men and to be able to stand up and sing 'God Save Us Nelly Queens' ... we were really not saying 'God Save Us Nelly Queens.' We were saying 'We have our rights, too.'
Sarria fought against police harassment, both of gays and of gay bars. Raids on gay bars were routine, with everyone inside the raided bar taken into custody and charged with such crimes as being "inmates in a disorderly house". Although the charges were routinely dropped, the arrested patrons' names, addresses and workplaces were printed in the newspapers. When charges were not dropped, the arrested men usually quietly pleaded guilty. Sarria encouraged men to plead not guilty and demand a jury trial. Following Sarria's advice, more and more gay men began demanding jury trials, so many that court dockets were overloaded and judges began expecting that prosecutors have actual evidence against the accused before going to trial. One favored harassment technique, employed especially on Halloween after midnight, was to arrest drag queens under an old city ordinance that made it illegal for a man to dress in women's clothing with an "intent to deceive". In consultation with attorney Melvin Belli, Sarria countered this tactic by distributing labels to his fellow drag queens (hand-made, in the shape of a black cat's head) that read "I am a boy". If confronted, the queen would simply display the tag to prove that there was no intent to deceive. Sarria's actions helped bring an end to Halloween police raids.
Sarria ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1961, becoming the first openly gay candidate for public office in the United States. Although Sarria never expected to win He almost won one of the five available seats until city officials realised only five candidates had registered. Sarria ended up getting 6,000 votes and finishing in ninth. However the voting stunned the political community who now saw the LGBT community as a voting block with power.
Along with Guy Strait, Sarria formed the League for Civil Education (LCE) in 1960 or 1961. The LCE ran educational programs on the topic of homosexuality and provided support for men being ostracized for being gay and for those caught in police raids. In 1962, Sarria along with bar owners and employees formed the Tavern Guild, the country's first gay business association. The Guild raised money for legal fees and bail for people arrested at gay bars and helped bar owners coordinate their response to the harassment of the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control and the police. Sarria continued to perform and agitate at the Black Cat until, after some 15 years of unrelenting police pressure, the bar lost its liquor license in 1963.
With the demise of the Black Cat, Sarria helped found the Society for Individual Rights (SIR) in 1963. SIR grew out of a split between Sarria and Strait over the direction that LCE was heading; Sarria and his backers wanted to maintain focus on street-level organizing. SIR sponsored both social and political functions, including bowling leagues, bridge clubs, voter registration drives and "Candidates' Nights" and published its own magazine, "Vector". In association with the Tavern Guild, SIR printed and distributed "Pocket Lawyers". These pocket-sized guides offered advice on what to do if arrested or harassed by police.
Halloween in the Tenderloin, North Beach, and on Polk Street.
Halloween in the Tenderloin grew in the early 1960s with the growing LGBT community and welcomed tourists – who many of the prostitutes and hustlers relied upon for income. By the late 1960s, a major celebration area during Halloween was along Grant Avenue in North Beach, on which there were many gay bars in the late 1960s between Broadway and Union. By 1969, San Francisco had more gay people per capita than any American city; when the National Institute of Mental Health asked the Kinsey Institute to survey homosexuals, the Kinsey Institute chose San Francisco. Beginning in 1970, an annual Halloween celebration was held on Polk Street in Polk Gulch, then still the most important gay neighborhood. By the mid-1970s, Polk Street was overwhelmed and closed to traffic – at least for a few hours - each Halloween to make room for the costumed revelry. In 1979, the adult gay Halloween party moved to Castro Street in The Castro, which by the early 1970s had replaced Polk Gulch as San Francisco's most important gay neighborhood.
The Castro becomes a gay community.
The Eureka Valley of San Francisco, where Market and Castro Streets intersect, had for decades been a blue-collar Irish Catholic neighborhood synonymous with the Most Holy Redeemer Catholic Parish. Beginning in the 1960s, however, suburbs in Berkeley and Oakland attracted young families with children, and the city's economic base eroded as factories moved to cheaper locations nearby. Mayor Joseph Alioto, proud of his working-class background and supporters, based his political career on welcoming developers and attracting a Cardinal to the city. Many of the blue collar workers–who were also Alioto's supporters–lost their jobs as large corporations with service industry positions replaced factory and dry dock jobs. San Francisco had been "a city of villages": a decentralized city with ethnic enclaves that each surrounded its own main street. As the downtown area developed, neighborhoods suffered, including Castro Street. The Most Holy Redeemer Parish shops shut down, and houses were abandoned and shuttered. In 1963, real estate prices plummeted when most of the working-class families tried to sell their houses quickly after a gay bar opened in the neighborhood. Hippies, attracted to the free love ideals of the Haight-Ashbury area but repulsed by the crime rate, bought some of the cheap Victorian houses. In the 1970s, the LGBT community shifted to the Castro with a string of gay bars opening up and multitudes of gay men filing the sidewalks of the small business district. The Castro became the home of the Halloween event starting in 1979 amid concerns of gay bashing at the Polk street event in the Tenderloin.
Halloween as a "gay" holiday.
There are differing and complementary ideas on why LGBT communities, and expressly, gay men, are attracted to the holiday. Throughout the 1980s, Halloween street events in gay villages Key West, Florida, Christopher Street in New York, Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood and the Castro in San Francisco have evolved from informal parades into Mardi Gras-like events with "drinking and dancing and carrying on in the streets". San Francisco's Polk street Halloween developed in the 1970s as people came out and moved to Castro street in 1979. In addition to stereotypes about why LGBT people are attracted to fashion, theatricality and dressing up there are cultural reasons why the events have become "the major holiday" for LGBT people. In addition to the holiday's pagan roots, which is attractive to those who have been shunned by mainstream religions, many LGBT people are able to be outrageous and flamboyant even if they remain closeted. In the days before gay liberation, wearing masks symbolized that most gays were in the closet—if gays were interviewed on TV before 1969, they often wore masks so no one would know their real identity.
According to Bruce Mailman, a gay events organizer, "public partying on Halloween fits into gay liberation in general, being seen and heard" in a heteronormative society where media watchdog groups like GLAAD have had to campaign to ensure that LGBT people are portrayed and done so accurately without perpetuating negative stereotypes. In addition to visibility issues there is also escapism components as the LGBT community dealt with the AIDS pandemic and faced the generally negative domestic policy of the Reagan administration towards LGBT people and the AIDS crisis that was impacting the gay male communities.
SPI.
On Halloween night in 1989, two weeks after San Francisco was devastated by the 6.9 (Richter scale) Loma Prieta earthquake, the Sisters performed street theater and used donation buckets to collect thousands of dollars for the mayor's Earthquake Relief Fund from the Halloween crowds that poured into The Castro for the massive street party. The group formally added donation gates, a stage and structure to safely manage the event from 1990–1995, until "drunken gay-bashers out to get their kicks" convinced the group the event was unsafe without official city support. In 1995, the Sisters agreed to host a costume-mandatory dance, HallowQueen, in a SoMa gay nightclub – which raised over $6000 for charities – as their contribution to helping move the event out of the mostly residential neighborhood. In multi-year planning discussions on how to address the events challenges, New York City's Village Halloween Parade, the United States' largest Halloween celebration, was often cited as an example of the potential for the event to attract tourists and benefit local businesses as well. Started by Greenwich Village mask maker Ralph Lee in 1973, the evening parade attracts over two million spectators and participants, as well as roughly four million television viewers annually. It is the largest participatory parade in the country if not the world, encouraging spectators to march in the parade. Barbara Ehrenreich, in her book on mentions this as an example of how Halloween is transitioning from a children's holiday to an adult holiday and compares it to Mardi Gras. Halloween is now the United States' second most popular holiday (after Christmas) for decorating; the sale of candy and costumes are also extremely common during the holiday, which is marketed to children and adults alike.
2000 to Present.
A decade later, San Francisco still struggled to manage the event. The massive crowds quickly overwhelmed the streets, mass transit and due to the Castro's location along two major transport corridors, disrupting traffic flow well outside the neighborhood. 
In 2002, 500,000 people celebrated Halloween in the Castro and four people were stabbed. In 2003 the city's Entertainment Commission took responsibility for organizing the event.
In 2006, nine people were wounded when a shooter opened fire at the celebration. Halloween in the Castro was canceled, and in the following years a heavy police presence kept the event from happening spontaneously. In 2007, 600 police were deployed in the Castro on Halloween, a practice that continued in 2009 according to a police press release that announced a "zero tolerance policy for public drinking and other crime." By 2010, the city had cracked down completely on Halloween in the Castro, directing celebrants to various balls and parties elsewhere.
In 2009, The Sisters, through their 2009 Pink Saturday Grants program, donated money to an opera about Halloween in the Castro produced by the Lesbian and Gay Chorus of San Francisco. The opera ran in the Castro at MCC for two weeks, culminating in a final performance on Halloween night.
In hindsight, the Sisters were seen as a bargain of sorts, raising money every year for charity without city funds while keeping the chaos under control by providing entertainment and structure. They continue to stage and consult on large city events like Folsom Street Fair and Pink Saturday. The city, through the Entertainment Commission established in the early 2000s, is charged with addressing the ongoing issues of Halloween in the city with widespread agreement the Castro can no longer be the focus of a city-wide celebration.
As of 2011, the City of San Francisco's official site on the topic states:
"Halloween belongs to all of us. Following last year’s successful campaign to keep everyone safe and maintain the Castro’s tranquility, we’re continuing and expanding the Home for Halloween campaign. Like last year there is no party or special event in the Castro. However, there are lots of events and celebrations around San Francisco, throughout the Bay Area and right in your own “home” neighborhood!
This October 31st, bars and restaurants in the Castro will be open for business. However, as was the case last year the streets will not be closed to traffic. As in every other community in the City, there will be zero tolerance for behavior which doesn’t respect the celebrated diversity of our communities. And again like last year, there will be zero tolerance for individuals and businesses that do not obey alcohol consumption and distribution regulations. The Home For Halloween website will help promote your events so please let us know about what you have planned in your community.
The Castro is not appropriate for a party with 100,000 people. So, the Home For Halloween campaign enters its second year of celebrating Halloween throughout the Bay Area and encouraging people to respect everyone’s home, including the Castro. With your support, we can indeed make Halloween a “home” for celebrations that are fun, festive and respectful. Halloween is for everyone."

Alexander Robertson &amp; Sons

Alexander Robertson started repairing boats in a small workshop at Sandbank, Argyll in 1876, and went on to become one of the foremost wooden boat builders on Scotland's River Clyde. The 'golden years' of Robertson's yard were in the early 1900s when they started building some of the first IYRU 12mR & 15mR (Metre Class) racing yachts. Robertson's was well known for the quality of its workmanship and was chosen to build the first 15-metre yacht designed by William Fife III ("Shimna", 1907). More than 55 boats were built by Robertson's in preparation for the First World War and the yard remained busy even during the Great Depression in the 1930s, as many wealthy businessmen developed a passion for yacht racing on the Clyde. During World War II the yard was devoted to Admiralty work, producing a wide range of large high speed Fairmile Marine Motor Boats. After the war the yard built the successful one-class Loch Longs and two 12-metre challengers for the America's Cup: "Sceptre" (1958) and "Sovereign" (1964). Due to difficult business conditions the Robertson family sold the yard in 1965, and it was turned over to GRP production work until it closed in 1980. During its 104-year history, Robertson's Yard built 500 boats, many of which are still sailing today.
History of Robertson's Yard.
Alexander Robertson (1851-1937).
Alexander Robertson, the son of a crofter/fisherman from Tarskavaig on the Isle of Skye, was born in Inverkip on 29 August 1851. Following the catastrophic potato blight on Skye in 1846, Alexander's father left Tarskavaig to seek a better life fishing on the River Clyde. After his parents moved to Sandbank in 1859 to run the village Post Office, he served his apprenticeship as a boat builder in Dunoon and Govan. In 1876, at the age of 25, he teamed up with Daniel Kerr to build small boats at his workshop in Sandbank. The partnership was dissolved in 1878, and Robertson went on to acquire larger premises in order to expand the business. He initially designed many of the yachts and launches himself, but in later years used many leading designers of the day to carry out work on the larger boats. Robertson remained chairman of the company until 1935, two years before his death.
Robertson not only provided a significant source of employment in Sandbank, but he also played an important part in the local community. He made notable contributions in a number of areas: Argyll County Councillor representing Cowal; Parish Councillor; Justice of the Peace; member of the School Board; director of Dunoon District Cottage Hospital; on the Board of Management of the Parish Church and he was also responsible for organising many social gatherings in the village hall. He also took a very keen interest in yacht racing in the Holy Loch, even in his later years.
Early years.
By the age of 16, Robertson had started work as an apprentice with the Dunoon boatbuilder, Ewen Sutherland. After his initial training, further experience was acquired at Alexander Stephen and Sons Ltd of Linthouse, one of the main Govan yards. In 1876 Robertson, at the age of 25, teamed up with Daniel Kerr to form 'Robertson & Kerr, Boat Builders and Carpenters'. The initial boats built in their small workshop were modest 'clinker' craft and fishing skiffs, but they also carried out repairs, hired and stored boats, laid moorings and even earned money from fishing. This workshop was located in the grounds of his parent's Post Office (now Eckvale) near the old primary school. On 17 October 1878 the Robertson & Kerr partnership was dissolved when Daniel Kerr accepted a job with the Clyde Lighthouse Trust.
Robertson continued working at the small workshop for several years, for the most part repairing boats. As business was booming he began looking for larger premises and found an old distillery site (owned by Dugald McKinley, 1825–1833) with around of land, ample supplies of fresh water and good access to the sea. The land was purchased in 1879 and the first shed constructed in 1880. By 1887 the first phase of development of the site had been completed, and Alexander Robertson had the largest number of yachts (47) under his charge of any yard in Scotland. Construction of a slipway, to launch larger boats (greater than 25 ft) was held up for several years (1887–1892) because of the proposed plans to build the Clyde Ardrishaig and Crinan Railway, which would have passed through the yard.
Golden years.
A proper boat numbering system was introduced at the new 'distillery' site in 1889 and every detail relating to cost was recorded in large ledgers. Boat No 1 was a cutter designed by Alexander Robertson for John Dobbie of Dunoon, named "Cowal Lass". Boat No 3 was the "Fairlie", a cutter designed by William Fife III for A. Currie of Sandbank in 1890. This was the start of a long relationship with the famous Fife yard at Fairlie and over the years Robertsons built 11 Fife-designed yachts. A cutter called "Verve", designed by George Lennox Watson in 1892, was the first of many to be built at the yard. The 1894 G L Watson designed Gaff cutter "Camilla" is the oldest known Robertson yacht still sailing, and is based at Rhu. The Alfred Mylne-designed boats did not commence until 1900, with two , 19/24 Clyde class sloops, the "Valmai" and the "Susette". The Mylne family owned the Mylne-Robertson cutter "Medea" (Ex "Vladimir") for over 30 years. 
In April 1893 Alexander Robertson leased an acre of land on the 'foreshore & seabed' from the Board of Trade for a period of 31 years, with a rent of £2 per annum. Permission included the rights to extend the yard and build a slip, dock and wharf. The new slipway and pier were built in 1893, in time for wintering the boats at the end of the season. With an estimated cost of £4,000 - £5,000, this was one of the most important investments in Clyde yachting. The new slipway allowed boats greater than to be built and launched, and was considered one of the best in the land. It was reported in the New York Times, on 14 December 1895, that "In Robertson's yard, Sandbank, Clyde, about 100 craft have been taken ashore for the Winter...". This confirms the significant growth of the business as a result of the new slipway.
By 1900 most of the infrastructure required for the production of high calibre wooden boats was in place: pier, slipway, sawmills, workshops, building-sheds, stores, paint shop, engine house, sail loft and workers' houses. These were the golden years of the yard, during which they built classic racing yachts: 15-metre "Shimna" (later "Slec") (Willian Fife III, 1907); 15-metre "Tritonia" (later "Jeano" and "Cisne Branco" - Alfred Mylne, 1910), 12-metre "Heatherbell" (Thomas Glen-Coats, 1907); 12-metre "Cyra" (Alfred Mylne, 1909) - note : renamed "Arcula" around 1934 and destroyed by the Wehrmacht 1943 or 1944 who killed the owner Frits Johannsen (DK); 10-metre "Pampero" (1912); 8-metre "Novena" (1908); 5-metre "Mungo" (1908). "Elrhuna", a sloop was designed by Alexander in 1904, and due to the quality of the wood and sound construction she still races regularly on the west coast of Scotland. The first of many motor boats were built in 1905, among them a luxurious teak-built 'carvel' motor launch ordered for the "S Y Nahma", which was the last boat designed by George Lennox Watson. The development of early steam boats by Alexander provided the necessary expertise to build 7 steam powered launches for the Admiralty in the years leading up to World War I.
Robertson’s Yard was exceptionally busy in 1908. As well as four racing yachts, one large motor launch and several tenders under construction, they had plenty of hollow-spar work and major modifications to the "Susanne". The yard employed seventy men and they had to work overtime to keep up with the ambitious building programme. Many alterations were made to the yard and they had a new building shed with headroom and a moulding-loft. The yard was now capable of building yachts of any size, and it was hoped some 23-metre work would follow.
Robertson was a rather astute businessman so, as the yard was booming in the early 1900s, he began buying up properties along the shore of the Holy Loch to stop other boat yards being built. 
The wars.
Over 55 boats were built by Robertson's in preparation for the First World War, and after the war the yard started to diversify and fit-out larger yachts. The company had been run by Robertson for many years, but now three of his sons were helping to run the family business. In 1922 Robertson decided to re-structure the organisation so it could be operated without him in the future. Alexander Robertson & Sons (Yachtbuilders) Limited was formally established on 5 August 1922 to ""carry out all aspects of designing, building and repair of yachts, sale of yachts and sail making"". Four of Robertson's sons helped to run the business in later years: Archibald; Alexander (Alec); Donald; and George.
Robertson's Yard was now looking for a new designer and by the end of 1929 David Boyd had replied to an advertisement in the Glasgow Herald. In 1937 he designed the sleek 6-metre racing yacht "Circe", which was described by many as the most successful racing yacht ever produced by the yard. J. Herbert Thom, one of the Clyde's best helmsmen sailed the yacht with tremendous success in America in 1938 and brought back the 'Seawanhaka Cup', which was successfully defended in home waters the following year.
Archibald Robertson was the senior director in the company and destined to take over operation of the yard before he died in November 1929. Alexander remained chairman of the company until June 1935, when he was 84. Even after that he maintained a keen interest in the operation and was often first at the yard in the morning to see the men get started. He died on 15 February 1937 at the family home, 'Tarskavaig', named after the small crofting village on the Isle of Skye.
The first order for a lifeboat from the Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI) was secured by the yard in 1935. The "Charlotte Elizabeth" was the first motor-powered lifeboat launched in Scotland, and was later stationed in Port Askaig, Islay: she now lies abandoned by Thurso Harbour in Caithness [http://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/6641/Rotting_lifeboat_s_claim_to_fame_revealed.html] (correct as of 13 Jun 2009). Orders for a further 10 lifeboats followed, several of which came back for regular servicing. 
During the 1930s many gigs (or tenders) were built for larger boats launched further up the Clyde, among them the "MY Virginia" and "SY Nahlin". A luxury motor launch was built for the owner of the "SY Nahlin", along with a motor tender for the crew, two lifeboats and two dinghies. 
Several larger boats were also built during this impressive pre-war period: "Caretta", twin screw motor launch designed by Messrs G L Watson in 1927; "Ron", ketch designed by J A McCallum in 1928; "Southern Cross", ketch designed by G L Watson in 1930; "Zigeuner", yawl designed by David Boyd in 1935 
The specially fitted out 'ocean going' cruiser "Southern Cross" left Robertson's Yard on 26 October 1930 and set sail on a 3 year round the world trip, arriving at Brisbane in October 1931. Tragically, on the return leg her owner D Guthrie Dunn was lost overboard near St Helena. The yacht was brought back to Robertson's Yard by a new crew on 8 July 1933, where she was refitted and sold on. D Guthrie Dunn's cousin Miss E Mathieson donated a magnificent silver model of "Southern Cross" to the Ayr Yacht Club around 1965 which used as a trophy for the famous Ailsa Craig offshore yacht race.
During the Second World War the yard was devoted to Admiralty work. A total of 23 fast Fairmile Marine motor boats were launched during the war: Fairmile A motor launch, triple screw (1); Fairmile B motor launch, twin screw (7); Fairmile C motor gun boat, triple screw (3); Fairmile D motor torpedo boat, quadruple screw (12). Some of the boats returned for servicing during the war and many others were repaired or modified for the Admiralty.
A number of Robertson-built Fairmile boats had distinguished war records: ML-160 was lead vessel in the starboard column during Operation Chariot, the St Nazaire Raid on the heavily defended German dry dock and naval base in March 1942; many of the boats took part in Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy; and several of these high speed launches were engaged in clandestine operations in Norway and the Mediterranean. 
Sailing in the Clyde area was restricted during the war, although the Holy Loch appears to have been an unrestricted area in March 1940. The Clyde racing fleet did not make its official appearance after the war until 25 May 1946. Due to the shortage of materials the cost of building a new yacht had increased by 50% between 1939 and 1945.
Winds of change.
Boat building and yachting in particular changed direction dramatically after the war. Larger boats with crews all but disappeared and they were gradually replaced by more economical cruising and racing yachts. The 'one-off' design/building work that the yard specialised in was replaced by 'one-design' yachts, which began with Uffa Fox's Flying Fifteens in 1948 and the successful Loch Longs in 1949.
In September 1956 a Royal Yacht Squadron syndicate was formed to build a 12-metre for the 1958 America's Cup. The challenger was selected based on model tank testing and David Boyd's second design was chosen. In October 1957 "Sceptre" was beginning to take shape at Robertson's yard in Sandbank. She was officially launched on 2 April 1958. Some initial testing took place in the Holy Loch, but more extensive trials were carried out in the Solent before she was shipped to America. The "Sceptre" lost to the New York Yacht Club yacht "Columbia" in September 1958.
The luxuriously appointed "Lone Fox" was built in early 1957, in the same shed as "Sceptre", and was Colonel W H (Bill) Whitbread's personal yacht for a quarter of a century. Colonel Whitbread was head of the well known brewery firm, and sponsor of the famous round-the-world race. She later won many races in California, and now competes regularly in the Caribbean Classic yacht races. "Lone Fox" took top honours in the 2011 Antigua Classic Regatta winning; class, fleet, and fastest overall boat. Duran Duran presented the Panerai Trophy to Lone Fox for fastest time in the 2012 Antigua Classic Sailing Regatta.
David Boyd was again chosen to design a new 12-metre challenger for the 1964 Americas Cup. The "Sovereign" [http://www.americascup.com/en/acclopaedia/circlinggalaxy/bateau.php?idContent=4893] was launched on 6 June 1963, but by August the Royal Thames Yacht Club Committee was anxious about her performance and David Boyd was asked to design another boat similar to "Sovereign", which was named "Kurrewa V". Before the two yachts left British waters they conducted trial races in May/June 1964 and the "Sovereign" was officially selected as the challenger. Although the New York Yacht Club yacht "Constellation" won the America's Cup off Newport, Rhode Island, "Sovereign" was much admired for her graceful lines and magnificent teak deck.
It was around this time that major business problems started to appear and during a slow period the yard found work building fast launches for the RAF. They undertook fixed price contracts for two 63' General Service Mk 1 Pinnaces, but delays, design changes and escalating cost of materials put the yard in financial difficulties. At the AGM held on 4 June 1963, discussion took place regarding the adverse outcomes of these contracts and it was agreed efforts should be made to sell the yard. The Robertson family finally sold the yard in 1965 for £27,750 and it became a subsidiary of the Auchinleck Investment Co of Glasgow (comprising a syndicate of 5 well-known Clyde yachtsmen), essentially ending wooden boat building there.
GRP production.
The yard continued to operate for a further 14 years assembling a wide range of GRP (fibreglass) boats such as Pipers, Ohlsons, Etchells and Pilot Launches. The rising cost of oil and resin along with strong competition from the more established GRP yards down south brought boatbuilding to a close in 1980. Buildings in the lower yard were finally pulled down in the late 1980s and the site was levelled for re-development. All that was left of the original yard was the slipway and the boats that were once launched from it.
Houses have now been built in the upper yard, and the lower yard site became incorporated in the new Holy Loch Marina development during 2009.
Tables - boats and designers.
A total of 500 numbered boats were built at the yard, according to the yard build-book. However, in addition, around 300 smaller boats (under 20 ft) were also built: fishing skiffs; rowing boats; sailing dinghies; tenders (gigs); sailing lifeboats; motorised lifeboats.
Classic wooden boats.
A wide range of Classic Wooden Boats were built at Robertson's Yard.
In addition to the series of Classic Boats above, there were many 'one-off' Classic Boats which were built at Robertson's Yard.
Designers.
Robertson's Yard built boats were designed by many famous naval architects throughout its history, among them, David Boyd who joined the yard in 1929.
Note - The above counts for Alexander Robertson and David Boyd are probably understated - some of their boat designs were attributed to 'the builder', by Lloyd's Register.
GRP boats.
The table provides a summary of the main classes of GRP boats fitted-out (hull purchased elsewhere), or built at the yard.

Yachting history - emergence of the Clyde and Robertsons Yard.
This section provides a brief history of yachting in the UK and attempts to put the emergence of the Clyde and the story of Robertson's Yard in context.
During the early part of the 17th century sailing for ‘private pleasure’ began in the Netherlands. However, it was only after King Charles II of England returned from exile in the Netherlands in 1660, and was presented with a yacht named Mary, did sailing begin on the Thames. Prior to this time the word ‘yacht’ was completely unknown in England. The first yacht race, which was patronised by the royal court, took place on the Thames in 1662. It is believed that due to Royal connections, private sailing started to become popular in Cork during the late 17th century. The first yacht club in the world, ‘The Water Club of the Harbour of Cork’, was established in 1720. This famous club was subsequently reformed and went on to become the Royal Cork Yacht Club in 1831 [http://1911encyclopedia.org/Yachting].
In the 18th century yachting in Britain was a very much an exclusive sport enjoyed only by the very rich, aristocrats and Royalty. From the middle to the end of the 18th century some races took place, but yachting developed very slowly. 
During the 19th century yachting became a much less exclusive sport. Although there were only a few yachts over 35 tons at the start of the century, the British yacht fleet increased dramatically from around 50 in 1812, to 500 in 1850 and 2,200 by 1902. 
The first yacht club in England was formed out of the Cumberland Society fleet in 1775 and went on to become the Royal Thames Yacht Club in 1830. The Yacht Club of Cowes was founded in 1815, which became the Royal Yacht Squadron in 1833. Regular weekly races were being organised at Cowes from 1826. Although yachting started on the Thames, the Solent became a much more popular venue by the middle of the 19th century. The first American yacht arrived in Cowes in 1851, which heralded the start of sailing as an international sport, and was a precursor to the America's Cup.
The first yacht club on the Clyde was the Northern Yacht Club, which appeared in 1824 and received its Royal Warrant in 1831. The club was founded to organise and encourage the sport, and by 1825 Scottish and Irish clubs were racing against each other on the Clyde. However, it was not until 1856 and the foundation of the Clyde Model Yacht Club (which later became the Royal Clyde Yacht Club) that regular weekly races took place. The Royal Yacht Club became a driving force of Clyde yachting, as three leading designers: William Fife III, George Lennox Watson and Alfred Mylne were among their members. The two senior clubs on the Clyde, the Royal Northern and the Royal Clyde, were amalgamated in 1978 to become the Royal Northern & Clyde Yacht Club.
The first recorded Clyde racing yacht, a 46-ton cutter, was built by Scotts of Greenock in 1803 .[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/transport/scotts5.htm] Scottish yacht designer William Fife started designing yachts as early as 1807, but his first large yacht Lamlash, a 50 ton yawl, was not completed until 1812. This was the first Scottish yacht to cruise in the Mediterranean. 
The rapid growth of Glasgow as an industrial city at the beginning of the 19th century was a direct result of an early project to deepen the Clyde, which was completed in 1812. The Industrial Revolution and growing overseas trade brought great wealth to the region. Many wealthy industrialists bought houses along the coast, away from all the pollution of the big cities, and developed a great passion for yachting. 
However, yacht building and yachting didn’t really take off on the Clyde until the middle of the 19th century. During the 1850s’ the new sailing clubs were very active and William Fife & Sons dramatically increased the rate of building yachts at Fairlie from 2 to 5 per year. During the 1860s’ the yard had become well established and building increased from 5 to 9 yachts every year. By the end of the century a series of yachts had been designed specifically for sailing on the Clyde: 17/19; 19/24; restricted.
The creation of the International Yacht Racing Union and the International Rule in 1907 provided a big boost to yacht building in the early part of the 20th century, and prior to World War I, the British yachting fleet had grown to around 3,900. The emergence of a group of talented Clyde yacht designers such as William Fife III, George Lennox Watson, Alfred Mylne, James McGruer and David Boyd in the first half of the 20th century firmly established the pre-eminent position of Clyde yachts on the high seas. The River Clyde became, like Cowes and Kiel, a centre for yachting.

HMS "Investigator" was a wooden paddle survey vessel of the Royal Navy, built to carry out an expedition on the Gabon River in Africa.
"Investigator" was laid down on 15 June 1861 at Deptford and was launched on 16 November 1861. She was initially commanded by Lieutenant Benjamin Langlois Lefroy off the west coast of Africa. He was succeeded by George Truman Morrell in 1865, under whose command she sailed up the River Niger, making contact with local tribes. "Investigator" was sold to the local authorities at Lagos in 1869.

Walton Girls High School

Walton Girls' High School and Sixth Form is a secondary school with academy status for girls aged 11 to 16, with a mixed sixth form, in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. It is situated in the south-west of the town near the A607 junction with the A1.
Admissions.
It accepts around 135 girls a year.
Walton became a specialist school in Performing Arts in 2002. It was awarded a second specialism in Applied Learning in December 2006, and a third, Languages, in April 2009. The school became eligible to apply to have a sixth form, and the first sixth form students started in September 2008
Previous head teachers include Rosalind Gulson OBE. She received her OBE in the 2006 New Year Honours.
History.
The school opened on its present site in 1966, with construction started in 1964. It took its name after one of the early townships of Grantham - Spittlegate, Houghton, and Walton. It was known as Walton Girls' County Secondary School and was the third purpose-built new secondary school to open in Grantham.
On 14 October 1977 the school hosted BBC Radio 4's "Any Questions?" - the first time it had been staged in Grantham. The panel host was David Jacobs, and the guests were Sally Oppenheim, Austin Mitchell (newly elected MP for Grimsby), Steve Race (originally from Lincoln) and the author Alan Garner.
Sixth form.
A new sixth form building, incorporating a theatre, was officially opened in June 2010. 
The school had initially had a small sixth form, for under 20 girls, teaching Art, English and Biology at A level.
Girls' Central School.
It was formerly the Girls' Central School on Agnes Street, off Castlegate. The equivalent Boys' Central School became the co-educational Central School at Manthorpe, in 1978. The former Girls' Central School building, between Agnes Street and Castlegate, became the Stepping Stones Nursery, an annex of Grantham College.
The Girls' Central School was not a secondary modern school, and required a good result in the eleven-plus exam to be admitted. It was similar to a technical school in its admittance procedure. When a new site for the school was planned, the site's position was supported by parents, provided it remained single sex.
School site.
Facilities, on a single site, are regularly refurbished and modernised, and include a sports field.
Additions to the original school building include a Modern Foreign Language block, a Technology Block, a suite of four specialist Science laboratories, a purpose built Performing Arts studio and PE changing rooms. 
Curriculum.
The curriculum at Key Stage 3 for 11-14 year old pupils covers the National Curriculum subjects. For English, Mathematics and Science pupils are taught in ability groups, as is French in Year 8 and Year 9. Ability groups are reviewed annually and changes are made in each pupil's best interest following a review of her work.
Design Technology includes separate courses in Food, Resistant Materials and Textiles. Art includes disciplines of Drawing and Painting, and Textiles. Walton's course of study for 14-16 year olds at Key Stage 4 has a number of GCSE examination subjects which have to be taken by all: English (including English Literature), Mathematics, Science, Citizenship, Religious Studies and ICT. Pupils also take core Physical Education and Careers Education, which are not examined. The pupils also choose other subjects to add to this core. English, Mathematics and Science are taught in ability groups; all other subjects are taught to mixed ability groups. Subjects vary slightly from year to year.
The Sixth Form teaches both BTEC and GCE 'A' Level subjects, some of which run in collaboration with the town's grammar schools.
Extra-curricular activities.
Pupils take musical and artistic activities, sport, where they compete with local regional teams, and participate in a Maths Challenge, Young Enterprise scheme, public speaking and citizenship events. Visits at home and abroad help Languages, History and PE study.
Academic performance.
Walton, like many girls' schools, performs better academically at GCSE than many comparable coeducational schools. The school gains GCSE results better than most comprehensive schools in Lincolnshire, and is only surpassed some comprehensives in rural areas.
