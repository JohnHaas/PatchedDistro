Lorenzo Marcello

Lorenzo Marcello (Venice, 1603 – Dardanelles, 26 June 1656) was a Venetian admiral.
He fought against the Papal navy in 1642-1644 and subsequently participated in the new Turkish-Venetian War. In September 1655, he succeeded Francesco Morosini as the Captain General of the Sea. From this position he led the combined Venetian-Maltese fleet in battle in the Dardanelles in June 1656. Although he himself lost his life during the battle, it resulted in the greatest Venetian victory since the Battle of Lepanto.
Honours.
The name "Lorenzo Marcello" has been given to two Italian ships: a liner (1,413 grt, 234 ft. long) built in the 1920s and sunk in 1943, and a "Marcello"-class submarine, launched on 20 November 1937 and sunk on 22 February 1941.

Cindy Church

Cindy Church is a Canadian country and folk artist. Church released three studio albums on Stony Plain Records and was nominated for Best Country Female Vocalist at the Juno Awards in 1995 and 1996. She is also a member of the award winning group Quartette.
Biography.
In 1984, Cindy Church, along with guitarist Nathan Tinkham, joined Ian Tyson's band, the Chinook Arch Raiders. Church sang background vocals on three of Tyson's albums. In 1987, Church founded the traditional country music trio Great Western Orchestra with Tinkham and mandolinist David Wilkie. The group recorded an album for Sony Music Canada and received a 1990 Juno Award nomination for Best Country Group or Duo.
Church launched a solo career in 1992 with the release of the single "The Road to Home." Her second single, "A Song for Brent," was recorded in honour of Brent Berezay, who became a paraplegic following a rodeo accident. Proceeds from the song went to the Song for Brent Society.
Church won Female Artist of the Year at the 1993 Alberta Country Music Awards. That same year, she joined singer-songwriters Sylvia Tyson, Caitlin Hanford and Colleen Peterson to form the country and folk music group Quartette. Quartette won the Canadian Country Music Association's award for Vocal Collaboration of the Year in 1994 and received three consecutive Juno Award nominations for Best Country Group or Duo from 1995-1997. Peterson was forced to leave the group when she was diagnosed with cancer in 1996. She chose her friend Gwen Swick to fill in for her.
Church issued her debut solo album, "Love on the Range", in 1994. Included was the Top 20 single "Rockabilly Heart." She received a nomination from the Canadian Country Music Association for Female Artist of the Year, and was also nominated for Best Country Female Vocalist at the Juno Awards in 1995 and 1996. Her second studio album, "Just a Little Rain", was released in 1995.
Church's eponymous third album was released in 1996. The album featured a duet with Ian Tyson on a song written by Tyson, "What Does She See." The collaboration resulted in a 1998 Juno Award nomination for Best Country Group or Duo. Church continues to perform as a member of Quartete, who issued their sixth studio album, "Down at the Fair", in 2007. She is also a member of the group Lunch At Allen's and performs in a tribute to Hoagy Carmichael, "The Nearness of You."

Koshigoe

This small town's name has gone down to history for its deep links with beloved hero Minamoto no Yoshitsune who, having defeated the Taira clan in 1185, arrived in Koshigoe with Taira no Munemori as his prisoner in tow. He meant to bring him personally to Kamakura, but was forbidden to enter by his brother Yoritomo. His prisoner was however taken away and paraded on Wakamiya Ōji, Kamakura's main street. Yoshitsune waited fruitlessly for the permission to enter for about 20 days at Koshigoe's Manpuku-ji, near Shichirigahama, then dictated to his attendant Benkei a letter for Yoritomo destined to become famous, the "Letter from Koshigoe". He later gave up and left, but his brother pursued him and his severed head, pickled in sake, was exposed to the public's view, again in Koshigoe, four years later. In 1335, Hōjō Tokiyuki was defeated here by Ashikaga Takauji and his army.

The village has a population of 380. However, according to a local custom also neighbouring villages are called with the same name, especially Nowy Jadów-Letnisko and Borzymy-Letnisko; together these create an almost seamless complex spreading on both sides of the two-track Warsaw-Białystok railway line (former Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway). The villages are served by a railway stop named after Urle, too; the stop is used only by local trains of Koleje Mazowieckie (previously PKP) that travel between Warsaw and Małkinia (or closer Łochów on the same line).
Urle lie on the western bank of small and shallow Liwiec river and are surrounded by pine forests. Its name is thought to have come from a word "orle" associated with wet areas. Thanks to the somewhat unique microclimate Urle have been a popular tourist and vacation destination for people living in Warsaw. Many wooden rent houses have been built there in the pre-WWII era; the role of a summer destination (reflected in the name "letnisko" of many of its satellite spots) continued throughout the times of Communism when several big camping centers were built. Individual people also kept on visiting the villages, renting flats in old rent houses or simply in peasant huts; this form of vacation was nicknamed "wczasy pod gruszą" (literally, "holidays under a pear tree"). In the tourist season, professional (though unofficial) "agents" waited for potential customers at the station. The popularity of Urle diminished after 1989; some camping centers, previously run by now troubled companies, were liquidated.

Helene Mambu

Hélène Mambu-ma-Disu, MD, MPH (aka Helene Mambu, born February 28, 1948) is a Congolese public health expert, physician, pediatrician and United Nations diplomat. She served as a Regional Adviser for the African regional office of the United Nations' World Health Organization, and later went on to serve for 18 years as a World Health Organization Resident Representative in several countries in the region, before retiring in 2008. She is currently Senior Program Officer for the Sustainable Immunization Financing Program of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, for whom she coordinates field activities in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, and Madagascar.
Early career and education.
Born in Bas-Congo, Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Helene Mambu received her Bachelor of Science degree in bio-chemistry in 1972 from Western College (now part of Miami University) in Oxford, Ohio, and went on to pursue and earn a medical degree in 1976, from Howard University in Washington, DC. After specializing in pediatrics at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in New York City, and earning a Master of Public Health and Tropical Medicine from Tulane University, she decided to go back to work in the Congo (then the Republic of Zaire).
Helene Mambu joined the Department of Health of Zaire in 1981, as the countrywide deputy-director of the joint division for combating child communicable diseases (CCCD), and the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). The massive division oversaw the implementation of the country's health policy in matters ranging from immunization, to malaria, diarrhea diseases, epidemiology, and HIV. Mambu went on to become the countrywide director of the division in 1983, a position she kept until her departure for the World health Organization in 1988. During those six years at the helm of the massive EPI/CCCD division, Mambu and her team helped implement a wide range of changes in the country's health system, in terms of its organization, its structure, and its infrastructure, the effects of which are still praised today by health experts.
World Health Organization.
In 1988, Helene Mambu joined the World Health Organization as a regional adviser for diarrhea diseases, at the WHO's Regional Office for Africa (WHO/AFRO), Brazzaville, Congo.
In 1990, she became the WHO Resident Representative (WR) to Rwanda, until April 1994 when the Rwandan genocide forced all the expatriate non-UNAMIR members of the United Nations country team to evacuate to safety in Nairobi, Kenya. She continued serving as representative to Rwanda until August 1994 from Nairobi.
Helene Mambu was later appointed WHO Resident Representative to Mali, where she served from 1995 to 2001, and then to Cameroon, where she served from 2001 until her retirement in February 2008.
As it is the case for many United Nations international civil servants, throughout her career, Mambu was called upon around the world, by several organizations, like the GAVI Alliance, as a WHO expert on wide-ranging health and wellness matters, as well as a diplomat.

Galaganatha is a small village located near Haveri, in the Haveri District, Karnataka. Located here is the famous Galageshwara Shiva Temple built during the rule of the Western Chalukyas. This large temple faces east and is situated along the Tungabhadra River. The rivers Tunga and Varada join at Galaganatha.
History.
Galaganatha was formerly known as Palluni. The Galageshwara temple, an example of the Chalukya style of architecture, was built here around the 11th century. Sri Venkatesh Galaganath (Kadambari Pitamaha) worshiped at the Galageshwara temple, and he wrote his novels on the temple premises.
Galageshwara temple.
The temple faces to east and it is situated along the Tungabhadra river. the temple consists of a huge Shiva Linga in a closed hall; it is called Sparsha linga. The temple has an unusual pyramidal basement and a large open hall. The Gopura (tower) is decorated with plain architectural elements while the wall panels of the back of the hall have some fine decorations. The interior has numerous niches containing figural sculpture including Ganesha.
Inscriptions.
A large inscription slab in the open hall of Galageshwara temple dates from AD 1080 and records a grant to the God Galageshvara. The date gives an indication of the era when the temple was built.
The inscription here informs about the prevalence of the tradition of dance and music. The high state of development which the art of music had reached in the 11th century A.D. can be gathered from an inscription of Chalukya king Vikramaditya from Galaganath, Haveri Taluk and Haveri District, North Karnataka, which mentions a certain Mokhari Barmmayya, a musician of high order, titled Battisaraga-bahu-kala-Brahma meaning skilled in 32 ragas.

Macular telangiectasia

Idiopathic Juxtafoveal Macular Telangiectasia (MacTel) is a condition of the retina about which little is known. It may result in blindness. It is a form of pathologically dilated blood vessels (telangiectasia) at the region of highest visual acuity, the yellow spot in the human eye (macula). The tissue deteriorates and the retinal structure becomes scarred due to the development of liquid-filled cysts, which impairs nutrition of the photoreceptor cells and destroys vision permanently.
MacTel seems to be distinguishable from AMD (age-related macular degeneration by the involvement of different vasculature. In the latter case the choroidal (basal) vessel system is often altered, while in MacTel the retinal capillaries change shape before irreversible changes are taking place and destroy the photoreceptors.
MacTel (Macular Telangiectasia) is a disorder of the blood vessels which supply the macula, the central part of the retina that lines the back of the eye and picks up the light like the film in a camera. The “fovea,” in the center of the macula, has no blood vessels at all because they would interfere with central vision. MacTel refers to a curious, very poorly understood condition of the blood vessels around the fovea (juxtafoveal) which become dilated and incompetent, like varicose veins but on a much smaller scale. While MacTel does not usually cause total blindness, it commonly causes loss of the central vision, which is required for reading and driving vision, over a period of 10–20 years.
Although MacTel has been previously regarded as a rare disease, it is in fact probably much more common than previously thought. The very subtle nature of the early findings in MacTel mean the diagnoses are often missed by optometrists and general ophthalmologists. No new information has emerged about the condition since its clinical features were first well described by Dr. J. Donald Gass in 1982. There is much work to be done to understand the disease better, to raise its profile and to search for treatments.
Possible treatments.
Treatment options for IJFT I include laser photocoagulation, intra-vitreal injections of steroids, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. Photocoagulation was recommended by Gass and remains to date the mainstay of treatment. It seems to be successful in causing resolution of exudation and VA improvement or stabilization in selected patients. 1,2 Photocoagulation should be used sparingly to reduce the chance of producing a symptomatic paracentral scotoma and metamorphopsia. Small burns (100–200 μm) of moderate intensity in a grid-pattern and on multiple occasions, if necessary, are recommended. It is unnecessary to destroy every dilated capillary, and, particularly during the initial session of photocoagulation, those on the edge of the capillary-free zone should be avoided.
Intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) which have proved to be beneficial in the treatment of macular edema by their anti-inflammatory effect, their downregulation of VEGF production, and stabilization of the blood retinal barrier,12,13 were reported anecdotally in the management of IJFT I. In two case reports, IVTA of 4 mg allowed a transitory reduction of retinal edema, with variable or no increase in VA. As expected with all IVTA injections, the edema recurred within 3–6 months, and no permanent improvement could be shown.14,15 In general, the effect of IVTA is short-lived and complications, mainly increased intraocular pressure and cataract, limit its use.
Indocyanine green angiography-guided laser photocoagulation directed at the leaky microaneurysms and vessels combined with sub-Tenon’s capsule injection of triamcinolone acetonide has also been reported in a limited number of patients with IJFT I with improvement or stabilization of vision after a mean follow-up of 10 months.16 Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of this treatment modality.
Recently, intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents, namely bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against pro-angiogenic, circulatory VEGF, and ranibizumab, a FDA-approved monoclonal antibody fragment that targets all VEGF-A isoforms, have shown improved visual outcome and reduced leakage in macular edema form diabetes and retinal venous occlusions. In one reported patient with IJFT I, a single intravitreal bevacizumab injection resulted in a marked increase in VA from 20/50 to 20/20, with significant and sustained decrease in both leakage on FA and cystoid macular edema on OCT up to 12 months.17 It is likely that patients with IJFT I with pronounced macular edema from leaky telangiectasis may benefit functionally and morphologically from intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, but this warrants further studies.
Today, laser photocoagulation remains mostly effective, but the optimal treatment of IJFT I is questioned, and larger series comparing different treatment modalities seem warranted. The rarity of the disease however, makes it difficult to assess in a controlled randomized manner.
Differential diagnosis.
When IJFT I is suspected, it must be differentiated from secondary telangiectasis caused by retinal vascular diseases such as retinal venous occlusions, diabetic retinopathy, radiation retinopathy, sickle cell maculopathy, inflammatory retinopathy/Irvine–Gass syndrome, ocular ischemic syndrome/carotid artery obstruction, hypertensive retinopathy, polycythemia vera retinopathy, and localized retinal capillary hemangioma. In addition, IJFT I should be clearly differentiated from dilated perifoveal capillaries with evidence of vitreous cellular infiltration secondary to acquired inflammatory disease or tapetoretinal dystrophy, or from Coats’ disease which is defined by extensive peripheral retinal telangiectasis, exudative retinal detachment, relatively young age of onset, and male predilection.5,8 Less commonly, macular telangiectasis has been described in association with fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, incontinentia pigmenti, and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy with posterior pole involvement.
MacTel Project.
The MacTel Project comprises more than 30 centers in Europe, North America, the Middle East, and Australia, including clinical centers; genetics, reading, and coordinating centers; and several basic science laboratories. The Scientific Executive Committee consists of Alan Bird, Emily Chew, Ian Constable, Marty Friedlander, Mark Gillies, Bob Graham, and Frank Holz.
The project encompasses a natural history observation study that identifies MacTel patients and follows the progression of their disease; a genetics study of MacTel patients and their family members designed to identify genes and genetic variants that may be associated with susceptibility for MacTel; and an eye donor program to study the histology and pathology of MacTel eyes.
A cohort of 400 participants has been enrolled and is being followed annually in order to fully characterize the nature of the condition and its progression. Relatives of the study subjects are screened for the genetic study.
The clinical research aims of the project include characterizing the clinical features and natural history of MacTel from the earliest to the vision-threatening stages; collecting genetic samples of affected individuals and their families; promoting and publicizing the disease among colleagues as an important subject for research; gathering evidence on the results of treatments that have been employed for patients with MacTel; and conducting pilot clinical trials of potential therapies for MacTel that are emerging as treatments for other retinal vascular diseases.
The laboratory research objectives of the project include producing a more detailed understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of MacTel in both the early and critical stages; identifying a mouse model or models for MacTel; clarifying the genetic basis for MacTel in mouse models and humans; and identifying potential novel treatments, possibly including drugs, cytokines, or human progenitor cells.
In addition to these research initiatives, project members are also involved in developing and supporting a Web site to provide information for patients with MacTel.
MacTel features.
Although MacTel is uncommon, its prevalence is probably higher than most physicians believe. The early findings are subtle, so the diagnosis is likely often missed by optometrists and general ophthalmologists. MacTel was detected in 0.1% of subjects in the Beaver Dam study population over age 45 years (Ronald Klein, MD, personal communication), but this is probably an underestimate because identification was made based only on color photographs.
No major new biomicroscopic features of MacTel have been identified since the early work of Gass and colleagues.1,3 The advent of optical coherence tomography (OCT) has allowed better characterization of the nature of the inner and outer lamellar cavities. Loss of central masking seen on autofluorescence studies, apparently due to loss of luteal pigment, is now recognized as probably the earliest and most sensitive and specific MacTel abnormality. Using adaptive optics, it is possible to image areas of photoreceptor damage in vivo.
The condition may remain stable for extended periods, sometimes interspersed with sudden decreases in vision. Patients’ loss of visual function is disproportionately worse than the impairment of their visual acuity, which is only mildly affected in many cases (Table 1).4
In patients with MacTel, as compared with a reference population, there is a significantly higher prevalence of systemic conditions associated with vascular disease, including history of hypertension, history of diabetes, and history of coronary disease (Table 2).
Familial transmission is now recognized in a small proportion of people with MacTel (Figure 1); however, the nature of any related genetic defect or defects remains elusive. The MacTel genetic study team hopes that exome analysis in the affected population and relatives may be more successful in identifying related variants.
Histopathology studies of a single post-mortem specimen have shown a loss of Mueller cell markers from central retina, suggesting that Mueller cell death may be involved in the pathogenesis. One animal model in which the receptor for very low density lipoproteins is “knocked out” mimics many of the clinical characteristics of the disease and other models are being developed in the laboratories. Animal studies using the established model have shown an anti-oxidant diet and a special form of gene therapy to be effective in preserving visual function in these mice.
Treatment options are limited. No treatment has to date been shown to prevent progression. The variable course of progression of the disease makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of treatments. Retinal laser photocoagulation is not helpful. It is hoped that a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease may lead to better treatments.
The use of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, which have proven so successful in treating age-related macular degeneration in the past 5 years, has been investigated in pilot studies for treatment of subretinal neovascularization in MacTel. Ranibizumab given before the development of subretinal neovascularization dramatically reduces the vascular leak seen on angiography, although microperimetry suggests that neural atrophy may still proceed in treated eyes.
Conclusions.
At 5 years, the MacTel Project has gleaned an enormous amount of information about MacTel type 2, but the disease’s pathogenesis remains obscure and no treatments are available.
Further study of subclinical disease will likely help to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Goals of the MacTel Project now include further research to identify related gene defects, further development of animal models, the use of adaptive optics to study photoreceptor changes in the earliest clinical phenotype of the disease, identification of potential treatments, and ultimately a phase 3 clinical trial with one or more candidate therapies. Exploratory clinical trials may begin this year. Additionally, another post mortem sample of the condition would help to confirm histologic findings and might reveal further valuable insights.
With the progress made against this puzzling disease at the 5-year mark of the MacTel Project, the project investigators hope to stimulate other groups to join in the research. With the help of a generous grant, the investigators are now calling for projects, with the potential to allocate up to $30,000 to successful applicants. We hope this funding opportunity will give us the chance to continue the work of the MacTel Project with new members and renewed vigor.
The MacTel project is being funded by the Lowy Medical Research Institute.
Signs and symptoms.
Patients with idiopathic juxtafovealretinal telangiectasia (IJRT) are typically 40 years of age or older. They may have a coincident history of ischemic vascular diseases such as diabetes or hypertension, but these do not appear to be causative factors.
IJRT may present with a wide range of visual impact, from totally asymptomatic to substantially impaired; in most cases however, patients retain functional acuity of 20/200 or better.
Metamorphopsia may be a subjective com-plaint. The key fundal findings in IJRT involve a focal area of diminished retinal transparency (i.e. graying) and/or small retinal hemorrhages just temporal to the fovea. Dilated capillaries may also be noted within this area, and while this is often difficult to visualize ophthalmo scopically, the abnormal capillary pattern is readily identifiable with fluorescein angiography.
Areas of focal RPE hyperplasia, i.e.pigment plaques, often develop in the paramacular region as aresponse to these abnormal vessels. Other signs of IJRT include right angle venules, representing an unusual alteration of the vasculaturein the paramacular area,with vesselstaking an abrupt turn toward themacula as if being dragged.
Also,retinal crystals—fine, refractile deposits in the superficial retinal layers—may be seen within the affected area.
In some forms of the disease,lipid exudates are present.
Although a variety of complex classification schemes are described in the literature, there are essentially two forms of idiopathic juxtafoveal retinal telangiectasia (IJRT): unilateral and bilateral. The unilateral form, described by Yanuzzi as Type 1 or aneurysmal telangiectasia,occurs almost exclusively in males and is asymptomatic until after age 40.
In this group, lipid exudate is common, while pigment plaques and retinal crystals are rare. The bilateral form, also known as Type 2 or perifoveal telangiectasis, occurs equally in males and females.
Type 2IJRT is typically discovered between the ages of 40 and 60 years,with a mean ageof 55–59 years.
In this form of the dis-ease, parafoveal atrophy, right angle venules, RPE pigment plaques and retinal crystals are the prevailing signs.
Pathophysiology.
IJRT is probably best defined as an acquired capillary ectasia (i.e., a focal expansion or outpouching) and dilation in the parafoveal region, leading to vascular incompetence. The telangiectatic vessels develop micro-aneurysms, which subsequently leak fluid, blood, and occasionally, lipid. Some have described IJRT as a variant of Coats' disease, although this is a more accurate depiction of the Type 1 form than the Type 2 form.
While the precise etiology is unknown, it has been speculated that chronic venous congestion caused by obstruction of the retinal veins as they cross retinal arteries at the horizontal raphe may be a contributory factor.
In recent years, optical coherence tomography has been helpful in identifying more detailed fundus morphology associated with IJRT. One such finding is that there is often progressive fovealatrophy through the late stages of this disease.
It is thought that this collective loss of retinal cells may induce intraretinal neovascularization and, ultimately, subretinal or choroidal neo-vascularization (CNV). However, it should be noted that not all patients will develop CNV, as IJRT often spontaneously arrests.
Management.
The most crucial aspect of managing patients with IJRT is recognition of the clinical signs. This condition is relatively uncommon and has only been described in the literature during the past 25 years; hence, many practitioners may not be familiar with or experienced in diagnosing the disorder. IJRT must be part of the differential in any case of idiopathic paramacular hemorrhage, vasculopathy, macular edema or focal pigment hyper-trophy, especially in those patients with-out a history of retinopathy or contributory systemic disease.Diagnosis of IJRT may be aided by the use of ancillary testing. OCT can help to identify the abnormal vessels, pigment plaques, retinal crystals, fovealatrophy and intra-retinal cysts associated with this disorder.
Likewise, fluorescein angiography is beneficial in identifying the anomalous vasculature, particularly in the early stages of Type 2 disease.While some have argued that angiography is essential in making a definitive diagnosis, others suggest that such testing may be unnecessary when a diagnosis is apparent via less invasive means.
The natural history of IJRT suggests a slowly progressive disorder. A retrospective series of 20 patients over 10 to21 years showed deterioration of vision in more than 84% of eyes, either due to intra-retinal edema and serous retinal detachment (Type 1) or pigmented RPE scar formation or CNV (Type 2).
Historically, laser photocoagulation has been the recommended treatment early in the course of Type I IJRT to help suspend the exudative process and diminish macular edema.
In contrast, laser therapy is not considered a viable treatment option for Type 2 IJRT, unless frank neovascularization is evident on fluorescein angiography.
In fact, laser therapy may actually enhance vessel ectasia and promote intra-retinal fibrosis in these individuals.
Today, additional therapies include surgical removal of CNV, photodynamic therapy with verteporfin and treatment with anti-VEGF drugs such as bevacizumab.
However, these treatment modalities should be considered only in cases of marked and rapid vision loss secondary to macular edema or CNV. Otherwise, a conservative approach is recommended, since many of these patients will stabilize without intervention.
Clinical pearls.
IJRT may also be referred to by various names, including idiopathic juxtafoveolar, macular, perifoveal or parafoveal telangiectasis, depending on the source.All refer to the same syndrome.It is commonly under-diagnosed. The findings may appear very similar to diabetic retinopathy, and many cases ave been incorrectly ascribed to diabetic retinopathy. Unfortunately, this misdiagnosis has also occurred in patients who were not diabetic. Recognition of this condition can save a patient from unnecessarily undergoing extensive medical testing. Consider IJRT in cases of mild para-macular dot and blot hemorrhages inpatients without ischemic vascular disease such as diabetes and hypertension. Also, consider this diagnosis in cases of macularand paramacular RPE hyperplasia where no other cause can be identified

HMS Braak (1795)

HMS "Braak" was an 18-gun brig-sloop of the Royal Navy. She was launched at Rotterdam in 1781 and initially served with the Dutch Republic. The British seized her, in Britain, after the Dutch entry into the French Revolutionary Wars, and took her into the Royal Navy. She served briefly with the British before capsizing off the North American coast. She was subsequently the focus of a number of salvage efforts.
Dutch career.
The cutter "De Braak" was launched as a "botter", or vessel of the 8th Charter. Sources also give her name as "Baak", or "Brak". She was part of a Mediterranean fleet based at the French port of Toulon.
By the 1790s she was in the Caribbean, and was present at the defence of Willemstad, part of the Dutch colony at Curaçao, against the French in 1793. By late 1794 she was ordered to escort a convoy of East Indiamen to Batavia. En route she called at the English port of Falmouth, unaware that the French had since invaded the Netherlands and proclaimed the Batavian Republic, as a client state, compelling them to declare war on the British. On their arrival at the port the Royal Navy seized the 26 merchantmen, and six warships of the convoy, including the "De Braak". Officials from the sloop took over the "De Braak". Forty-six vessels of the Royal Navy that were at Plymouth shared in the prize money.
British career.
The Royal Navy took "De Braak" into service as HMS "Braak" and re-rigged her as a brig-sloop. She was initially commissioned under Commander James Drew on 13 June 1797, but was caught in a storm at the end of the year and dismasted. On the completion of repairs, she returned to service in February 1798 and was assigned to escort a convoy to the Virginia Capes. She sailed for Halifax on 17 March. On 2 April, whilst off the Azores, she became separated from the rest of ships. Towards the end of the month she fell in with and captured a Spanish ship, reportedly worth some £160,000 in prize money. The "Braak" duly arrived in Delaware Bay on 25 May, and took on a pilot from Cape Henlopen. Shortly after this a strong and sudden squall blew up and before the crew could take action the ship capsized. Drew and 35 of his crew were drowned, as were 12 Spanish prisoners.
Salvage and controversy.
The wreck lay on the bottom of Delaware Bay, but soon became the subject of rumours concerning the amount of treasure the "Braak" purportedly carried when she sank, with estimates of the value reaching $500 million. A number of artefacts were raised during the 1980s, but maritime archaeologists criticised these efforts for their disregard for proper archaeological methods, and for their discarding of anything not considered inherently valuable. The hull was eventually raised but in such a way that considerable damage was done to both it and the surrounding archaeology. The hull was eventually placed in a museum, as were many of the artefacts recovered. Only a small amount of coin was recovered, worth considerably less than the cost of the large number of salvage attempts that had been undertaken over the years. The treatment of the wreck of the "Braak", and of many others like it, was a contributing factor to the passage of the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act of 1987.

Kamienczyk, which was also called Kamieniec Mazowiecki, is located 5 kilometers east of Wyszkow. This former town has a long history: in 1377 - 1795, it was the seat of a separate castellany (later a county), which belonged to Land of Nur, part of Mazovia. The castellany of Kamienczyk/Kamieniec was established in 1377 in Sochaczew, during a meeting of dukes of the Duchy of Mazovia. 
In 1452, Kamieniec received Magdeburg rights, together with a number of privileges. In 1526, together with whole Mazovia, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Poland, and was one of main administrative centers of eastern part of Masovian Voivodeship. In 1565, Kamieniec had a defensive castle, a town hall, a cloth hall, three churches, royal court, a monastery and 189 houses. The town was completely destroyed during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660), and never regained its prominence. In 1869 Kamienczyk lost its town charter. The village suffered during World War Two, as it was twice destroyed (1939, 1944).

Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information

The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (FfDF) is the federal commissioner not only for data protection but also, since commencement of the German Freedom of Information Act on January 1, 2006, for freedom of information.
Before the commencement of the Act, his title was "Federal Commissioner for Data Protection #FfD#". In this capacity, according to the German Federal Data Protection Act #FDPA# [ Bundesdatenschutzgesetz #BDSG# ], he is an independent control entity providing monitoring for data protection in public federal government positions and at corporations, and telecommunications and postal services. He produces a semiannual activity report. The German Federal Government nominates him and the German Bundestag elects him. During his time in office, he receives remuneration in the amount commensurate with a federal official in salary group B 9. In this regard, his status is that of a public law official, but not, however, that of a civil servant. The term of office is five years. He can be reelected.
A right to refuse to give evidence is available to the federal commissioner in regard to persons and facts with which comes into contact in his capacity as federal commissioner #FDPA §23, sec. 4#. He is also empowered to decide about his employees' refusal to give evidence.
The German Federal Ministry of the Interior establishes the federal commissioner. His agency assumes an exceptional administrative organizational position. The FfDI's budget is accounted for in its own chapter. The necessary personnel and facilities are to be made available to him pursuant to legal regulations. Positions at the FfDI can only be filled with his approval.
The FfDI executes of his office independently subject only to law. There is no technical oversight #FDPA §22, sec. 4#. He is subject to the federal government's legal oversight as well as the Federal Ministry of the Interior's official oversight.
Peter Schaar has been the Office of the Federal Commissioner incumbent since December 17, 2003. Diethelm Gehold represents the FfDI and is its leading official.
The Federal Commissioner monitors #FDPA §24# and advises #FDPA §26, sec. 3# federal civil servants, other public positions at the federal level, telecommunications and the postal service on the grounds of the Telecommunications Act #TCA# [ Telekommunikationsgesetz #TKG# ] and postal law [ Postgesetz #PostG# ]. He advises and monitors implementation of security inspections according to the Security Review Law #SRL# [ Sicherheitsüberprüfungsgesetz #SÜG# ], even to the extent that they affect private business.

LGD-2226

LGD-2226 is an investigational selective androgen receptor modulator, which is being developed for treatment of muscle wasting and osteoporosis. 
LGD-2226 is an orally active, potent and selective agonist for androgen receptors which was shown to have anabolic effects in both muscle and bone tissue, but with considerably less effects on prostate weight and lutenizing hormone levels than testosterone.
Selective androgen receptor modulators may also be used by athletes to assist in training and increase physical stamina and fitness, potentially producing effects similar to anabolic steroids but with significantly less side effects. For this reason, SARMs have already been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency since January 2008 despite no drugs from this class yet being in clinical use, and blood tests for all known SARMs are currently being developed, including LGD-2226.

The 1929–30 FA Cup was the 55th season of the world's oldest football cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup. Arsenal won the competition for the first time, beating Huddersfield Town 2–0 in the final at Wembley.
Matches were scheduled to be played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. Some matches, however, might be rescheduled for other days if there were clashes with games for other competitions or the weather was inclement.

If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.
First round proper.
At this stage 41 clubs from the Football League Third Division North and South joined 24 non-league clubs and Third Division North side York City, who came through the qualifying rounds. Crystal Palace and Swindon Town were given a bye to the Third Round. To make the number of matches up, non-league Mansfield Town and Ilford were given byes to this round. 34 matches were scheduled to be played on Saturday, 30 November 1929. Seven were drawn and went to replays in the following midweek fixture, of which two went to a second replay.

Dante Falconeri

Dante Angelo Falconeri is a fictional character from the American ABC Daytime soap opera, "General Hospital". The role was originated by Canadian actor, Dominic Zamprogna in 2009.
Detective Dante Falconeri is the son of Port Charles king pin, Sonny Corinthos and his teenage flame, Olivia Falconeri. He is currently married to Lulu Spencer, the daughter of legendary supercouple, Luke and Laura. Dante's most significant storylines include; his shooting at the hands of his father which leads to the revelation of his paternity, his romance with Lulu and past with Ronnie Dimestico and his past with Sonny's longtime love, Brenda Barrett. The character's most recent storylines included their attempt at having a child and Lulu's kidnapping at the hands of Stavros Cassadine.
Storylines.
Dominic Pirelli arrives in town and immediately ingratiates himself to mob boss Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) when he saves his life during an ambush and rescues his son Morgan (Aaron Refvem). He also becomes smitten with Lulu Spencer (then Julie Marie Berman) much to the dismay of her brothers Lucky (Greg Vaughan) and Ethan (Nathan Parsons). Meanwhile it is revealed that Dominic is actually Dante, an undercover cop. On Sonny's orders, Dante teams up with his mother's boyfriend, Johnny Zacchara (Brandon Barash) to destroy a drug shipment and ends up getting arrested. Dante gets himself released after he clues the PCPD in on his investigation of Sonny. Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher) discovers Dante's identity and urges him to arrest Sonny sooner. Dante confesses his identity to Lulu when she gets trapped in the freezing water beneath the Zacchara mansion in an attempt to keep her alive. Meanwhile. Dante is furious with his childhood mentor, Ronnie Dimestico when he learns that Ronnie aided the release of the crazed serial killer/artist Franco (James Franco) when Dante arrested him; Franco later kidnaps Lulu forcing Dante to rescue her.
In January 2010, Dante's attempt to arrest Sonny ends with him getting shot. Dante is shocked to learn Sonny is his father, but instead of turning Sonny in for shooting him, he decides to send him to prison for killing his wife, Claudia Zacchara (Sarah Brown). Dante is shocked to learn that Sonny was covering for Michael and his persistence lands Michael in prison. With the whole world against them, Dante and Lulu grow closer. Meanwhile, Carly Corinthos Jacks (Laura Wright)'s attempt at getting revenge on Dante for sending her son Michael to prison culminates in Lulu catching Brook Lynn Ashton (Adrianne León) with a drugged Dante. In the summer of 2010, Dante's past with Brenda Barrett (Vanessa Marcil) comes to light and drives a wedge between himself and Lulu. Dante and Lulu eventually reconcile as her father Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) goes a drunken binge following his accidentally hit and run of his grandson Jake Spencer. Lulu follows him to Florida forcing Dante to go after her. When the owner of the bordello Lulu is working at discovers Dante is a cop, he attempts to rape Lulu, and Dante saves her. Upon their return to Port Charles, the couple moves in together. On the night he is about to propose Dante gets shot covering a shift for the drug addicted Lucky (Jonathan Jackson) making Lulu rethink marriage. They eventually get past the fear and decide marry in his hometown of Brooklyn. In 2012, Sonny stops Dante from getting shot. Meanwhile Dante and Lulu begin working together when she suspects Ronnie of attacking strippers in Port Charles. Ronnie kidnaps Lulu and attempts to kill her and frames Dante in the process. Fortunately, with assistance from John McBain (Michael Easton), Dante is able to rescue Lulu and Ronnie is killed. When Olivia begins having LSD induced visions, she sees Lulu pregnant. The couple begins trying to conceive and Lulu learns she can't carry to term. Fortunately, Lulu's best friend Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms) agrees to be their surrogate. In March 2013, as the couple celebrates the first sonogram with their parents, including Lulu's mother Laura Spencer (Genie Francis), Lulu is abducted. Luke and Laura believe their old rival Helena Cassadine (Constance Towers) to be behind the disappearance. The group tracks Helena down and a shootout ends in her death. At the Cassadine family compound in Greece, Dante finds Lulu (Emme Rylan) cryogenically frozen thank to Stavros Cassadine (Robert Kelker-Kelly) who has become obsessed with her. Dante, Luke and Laura manage to free an amnesiac Lulu and after much persistence, Lulu regains her memories. The couple then prepares for the birth of their baby.
Creation.
Background.
In September 2008, the series introduced Lisa LoCicero as Olivia Falconeri, the streetwise cousin of Kate Howard, played by Megan Ward. Kate is the fiancee of Maurice Benard's Sonny Corinthos. Rumors began to circulate that the character of Olivia and Sonny would share a past. LoCicero confirmed that the rumors were true and it was revealed that Olivia and Sonny dated briefly in high school. After their split, Sonny began dating Kate known as Connie Falconeri. LoCicero said that when Sonny invites Olivia to his and Kate's impending nuptials, " doesn't know there was quite a rivalry between the two women or that Olivia has something under her belt that’s going to create big excitement-and a lot of friction." In mid September, spoilers hinted that Olivia had a major secret that was set to be revealed very soon. On October 3, 2008, viewers learn of Olivia's son, Dante Angelo Falconeri during a phone conversation. At the end of the episode, a delirious Kate admits to Dr. Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson) that Dante is actually Sonny's son. Olivia gives birth to Dante in 1984 and swears Connie to secrecy while leading the entire neighborhood to believe that she is very promiscuous and has no idea who the child's father is.
Casting.
The series put out a casting call for the character and newcomer Nathan Parsons auditioned for the role. However, Parsons was cast in the role of Ethan Lovett instead. In September 2008, "Soap Opera Weekly" reported that the role could go to former "Guiding Light" star, Tom Pelphrey. It was speculated that ABC's offer to an actor of Pelphrey's caliber for the role of Dante was allegedly in response to possible departure of longtime leading man, Steve Burton who portrayed Jason Morgan. "TV Guide" alleged that the rumor was planted by the network to scare Burton into resigning with the series. By October 2008, "Soap Opera Weekly" reported that another Emmy winner, David Lago, known for his role as Raul Guittierez on "The Young and the Restless" had been cast in the role. Lago's first airdate was tentatively set for late November. Upon the announcement, it was reported the Pelphrey had turned down the role. However, by December ABC still had not confirmed Lago's casting and it was believed that actors were still auditioning for the role. In January 2009, "Soap Central" reported that ABC was prepared to make a decision between Lago and Pelphrey for the role. Meanwhile, Pelphrey relocated to California which fueled speculation that he had been cast in the role. However, Pelphrey then issued a statement admitting that he was looking for work outside of daytime making Lago the lead candidate for the role of Dante. A member of the casting department also revealed that the casting could be held off. In May 2009 it was announced that Pelphrey would return to "Guiding Light" to help usher it off the air and it was rumored that the role was being held for him. despite conflicting reports that the once suspended casting call had been reactivated. In late May 2009, Soapnet reported that Dominic Zamprogna was set to join the cast of the soap in the mysterious role of Dominic. "Soap Opera Digest" confirmed the news and confirmed that the Canadian actor's first air date was June 22, 2009. Zamprogna revealed in an interview that his manager told him about the role; he filmed the audition and sent to the casting director, Mark Teschner. Teschner loved the tape and sent it to the producers. A week later, the producers had Zamprogna fly to Los Angeles to read with Maurice Benard , and they immediately offered him a contract. Teschner remembered Zamprogna had auditioned for role of Juan Santiago about 10 years earlier, a role that went to Michael Saucedo.
According to "Soap Central", ABC was unable to cast the actor they initially wanted in the role, but the network refused to comment on the their initial idea for casting. The delayed casting led to reintroduction of Sonny's other son, Michael. Lago later revealed that he was never contacted by the series, but he was definitely open to it. Pelphrey revealed in an interview that he had been contacted by ABC, but he turned down the role. Zamprogna's Dominic was eventually revealed to be Dante.
Characterization.
According to the initial casting call, the character of Dante is "charming and flirtatious" with and abundantly arrogant, much like his father. Zamprogna initially described the character as a "smart, intelligent, loving kind of thug." The character is also written as very "witty," and "funny." He is almost fearless. "He's putting himself in front of people that could pull out a gun and shoot him right there." However, the character's fearless attitude is what makes the other character's respect him. Zamprogna continued, "'s gutsy" but not the typical "tough guy." The character is also very loyal to his family, and he is always "quick on his feet" said Zamprogna. Dante has a strong stance on morality that is very "black and white." For him, there are no "grey areas." However, upon his arrival in Port Charles, Dante quickly learns otherwise. According to Sara Bibel, Dante was initially scripted as lead character with a strong sense on what is right and what is wrong.
Development.
Introduction.
The initial casting revealed that Zamprogna's character is hired by Sarah Brown's Claudia Corinthos to assist her in one of her "ll-conceived schemes." It was also confirmed that Zamprogna's Dominic would share scenes with Sonny's teenage daughter, Kristina Davis (Lexi Ainsworth) which led to speculation that he could be a love interest for Kristina. Dominic character is shot during a shootout and runs into Morgan, Michael and Carly in the woods in route to Sonny's home. The confrontation serves as a catalyst for displaying the dangers of life in the mob to Michael who is obsessed with working for his father. At the same time, Ronnie Marmo's Ronnie Dimestico was introduced to the series. Regan Cellura wondered if Zamprogna and Marmo's characters having the same names as the actors was due to a lack of originality on the part of the writers. On July 1, 2009, Dan J. Kroll of "Soap Central" spoiled that Zamprogna's character indeed was Dante. However, the reveal had yet to happen onscreen. It was believed that Dante was using the alias "Dominic" to protect his mother from his life as a mobster. On August 7, 2009, it was confirmed onscreen that Dominic Pirelli was really Dante Falconeri, the undercover cop, and son of Sonny and Olivia. Dante's investigation into Claudia puts him on the path to uncovering the truth about Michael's part in their stepmother's death. At the time, Dante is still unaware of their connection.
Reception.
Despite critics like Nelson Branco of "TV Guide", and Sarah Brown who portrayed Claudia lobbying for Tom Pelphrey to get the job, Zamprogna won the role. "TV Source" magazine urged Pelphrey to take the role before it was filled. Dominic Zamprogna ranked at #1 on ""Daytime Confidential's" Top 10 Soap Newcomers of 2009." The list referred to the role as one of the most sought after roles in the past 10 years. The article continued and commented that not only was Zamprogna "a man who resembled Benard in stature and mannerisms, but more importantly could act his sexy behind off!" The post applauded the actor for selling every part of his storyline and said that Zamprogna was proof that being well known as an actor did not determine whether you made an impact. Jamey Giddens praised Zamprogna for his performance during the scene in which Dante confronted Sonny and tried to arrest him in January 2010 and said the performance solidified Zamprogna's place at the top of the newcomer list. Giddens also referred to him as a "Superstar-in-the-Making." "Daytime Confidential's" Perkie said the scene in which Dante confronted Sonny gave them goose bumps and referred to Zamprogna's performance as "mesmerizing." The scene was also spoofed on by Stephen Colbert on his late night talk show, "The Colbert Report" in July 2010.

Sufi Barkat Ali

Hadrat Abu Anees Muhammad Barkat Ali Al-Ludhianiwi (Quddisa Sirrahul Aziz; 27 April 1911 – 26 January 1997), also referred to as "Babaji Sarkar" by his disciples, was a Muslim Sufi saint who belongs to Chishtia order of Hazrat Baba Farid Gunj-e-Shakar R.A., born in a small village of Brahmi in the Tehsil of Ludhiana in Northern British India.
Hadrat is founder of the non-political, non-profit, religious organisation, Darul Ehsan.
Birth and early life.
Hadrat was born into a Muslim family belonging to the Dhariwal Jatt ethnic group.
His father, Mian Nigahi Bakhsh, was an employee of the British Army.
Like other Muslims, he learned the reading of the Qur'an in his village Brahmi and then went to the nearest available schools in the towns of Halwara, famous for its Indian Air Force base, to receive his education.
He gave various interviews to Pakistan National TV Channel PTV. On September 25, 2008, Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri praised the founder of Darul Ehsan, Barkat Ali and his work while talking to the participants.
Professional life.
At the age of 19, he joined the Royal British Army as a commission officer in the engineering core on the 9 April 1930. A special certificate of education from the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, was awarded to him along with the selection of “Voy cadet” in Military Academy. His tenure in the army was spent in the Roorki Cantt. He served the Royal Engineering Core for thirteen years only and was honorably discharged in 1945.
Religious visits to Khanqah-e-Sabir (the Holy Sanctuary of Hazrat Sabir) at Kalyar some away from Roorki Cantt was a regular habit of Barkat Ali. He would often spend the night there in worship whilst employed in the army.
Married Life and Family.
At the age of 16, he married Barkat Bibi in August 1927, who died on 9 January 1978 and was buried at Salarwala. His family consists of five daughters and one son; his son Mian Muhammad Anwar, died on 26 April 1981, at the age of 45.
Bay'ah.
Hadrat took allegiance ("Bay'ah") at the hands of his Pir, Hakeem Syed Amir-ul-Hassan Saharanpuri, whom he called the 'Sultan of Mysticism ("Shah-e-Wilayat")' on the 19 Rabi' al-thani 1363 A.H. at Peeran-e-Kalyar Sharif.

Tribute by non-Muslims.
American cultural anthropologist Katherine Pratt Ewing visited Darul Ehsan in 1977 for her research study and wrote a tribute to ali: "The presence of a living representative of the sufi traditions, who possesses all attributes of the original sufi pirs further reinforces the position that the pirs were not mysterious, magical figures of the mystical past, but were pious men. They performed for their era what living sufis can do today for ours."

Group information management

Erickson (2006) uses the phrase group information management or GIM, for short, to refer to personal information management (PIM) “as it functions in more public spheres.” People acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve and use information items to support individual needs. But these PIM activities are usually embedded in group or organizational contexts (Lutters, Ackerman & Zhou, 2007) and people usually perform these activities with sharing in mind (Erickson, 2006). The act of sharing moves personal information into spheres of group activity and also creates tensions that shape what and how the information is shared. The practice and the study of GIM focuses on this interaction between personal information and group contexts.

Argentine general election, 1958

The Argentine general election of 1958 was held on 23 February. Voters chose both the President and their legislators and with a turnout of 90.9% (the highest in Argentine electoral history), it produced the following results:
President.
aAbstentions.
Background.
The year 1955 cast a long shadow over these elections. President Juan Perón was violently overthrown in September of that year and the succeeding junta banned the Peronist Party and even the possession of Peronist mementoes or the very mention of the former leader or of the late Eva Perón. The junta did, however, convene a Civilian Advisory Board which, to the dismay of many conservatives, recommended against draconian measures or the reversal of most of Perón's reforms. They also called for a referendum ratifying the 1853 Constitution (which Perón had it heavily amended in 1949), while retaining Perón's Article 15, a section devoted to social reforms; the junta's leader, Gen. Pedro Aramburu, backed the panel's findings. An attempted countercoup against the junta, defeated on June 10, led to the execution of 27 plotters (including numerous civilians) and derailed Aramburu's hopes for the creation of a viable political alternative to the populist leader.
Seizing the opportunity, the Radical Civic Union (UCR)'s 1951 vice-presidential nominee, Arturo Frondizi secretly secured an agreement with the exiled Perón, by which the banned Peronists would be given a voice in exchange for their support. The pact, a mere rumor at the time, created a rift within the UCR at their party convention in November 1956, forcing Frondizi and his supporters to run on a splinter ("Intransigent") ticket and leaving more anti-Peronist UCR voters with Ricardo Balbín, the party's 1951 standard bearer. The two wings presented different candidates for the constituent assembly election called for July 28, 1957, with no clear winner, though the deadlocked assembly did ratify the Advisory Board's proposed constitutional changes.
Unmentionable by law, Perón became the central issue of the 1958 campaign. Argentina was abuzz with the staccato sounds of "El-qué-te-dije" (roughly translated to "You know who"), as he opposed Balbín, who accepted Pres. Aramburu's endorsement as the candidate of the ruling junta. Balbin, and his Radical Civic Union of the People, was dealt a "February surprise" when, four days before the election, the exiled leader publicly announced his endorsement of Frondizi. Blank votes (Peronist voters' choice during the assembly elections of 1957, which they narrowly "won") became Frondizi votes, making him the winner of the 1958 elections in Argentina.

4-Bromomethcathinone (4-BMC, Brephedrone) is a psychoactive drug and research chemical of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and cathinone chemical classes. It acts as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, but acts more like an antidepressant than a stimulant. It is currently unclear whether the 4-halogenated cathinones share the selective serotonergic neurotoxicity of their corresponding amphetamines.

Rutland Railroad

The Rutland Railroad was a railroad in the northeastern United States, located primarily in the state of Vermont but extending into the state of New York. Primary freight traffic was derived from dairy products. The Rutland system coverage resembled an upside-down "L" running from Chatham, New York, north to Alburgh, Vermont (the railroad's northernmost terminus was Noyan, Quebec), and west to Ogdensburg, New York, along the St. Lawrence River.
History.
The Rutland Railroad's early history is entwined with that of the Central Vermont Railway (today's New England Central Railroad) and with that of New England railroads in general. Two major themes in New England railroad history are the competition of the early railroads to build lines to the Great Lakes, and the consolidation of the multitude of small railroads into several major ones. The Rutland's early development involved three major routes:
Not until the turn of the century were the three routes united as one railroad.
Bellows Falls-Burlington route.
The Champlain & Connecticut River Rail Road Company was incorporated November 1, 1843, to build a railroad between Bellows Falls and Burlington, Vermont, as part of a route from Boston to Ogdensburg, New York. The enterprise was reorganized as the Rutland & Burlington Railroad in 1847, and the line was completed in December 1849. At Bellows Falls there were connections southeastward to Boston and south down the Connecticut River, but at Burlington the railroad fought and feuded with the Vermont Central Railroad for traffic and for connections with the Vermont & Canada Railroad at nearby Essex Junction. In 1854 the Rutland & Burlington defaulted on mortgage interest payments. It was reorganized in 1867 as the Rutland Railroad.
The Vermont Central leased the Rutland on December 30, 1870, partly to acquire Rutland's leases of the Vermont Valley Railroad (Bellows Falls-Brattleboro, Vermont) and the Vermont & Massachusetts Railroad (Brattleboro-Millers Falls, Massachusetts), which gave Vermont Central a connection to the New London Northern Railroad and a water route from New London, Connecticut, to New York. A more pressing reason for the lease was to forestall a move by the Rutland to construct a line around the south end of Lake Champlain, then north along the west shore of the lake to a connection west to Ogdensburg. The terms of the lease were particularly beneficial to the Rutland; the rental was better than the income the Rutland would earn operating it independently. In 1887 the Delaware & Hudson Railway (D&H) gained control of the Rutland, which was still leased to the Central Vermont (CV), the 1873 successor to the Vermont Central. The Rutland renewed its lease to the CV in 1890. CV entered receivership in 1896 and terminated the lease of the Rutland; in 1888 D&H had sold its interest in the Rutland to Percival W. Clement, a banker in Rutland (and later governor of Vermont).
Rutland-Bennington-Chatham route.
The Western Vermont Railroad was chartered in 1845 to build south from Rutland to North Bennington, then west to a connection with the Troy & Boston Railroad (T&B) at White Creek, New York. The railroad opened in 1853 and was leased to the T&B in 1857, forming a roundabout route from Boston to the Hudson River in conjunction with the Rutland & Burlington, Cheshire, and Fitchburg railroads. The Western Vermont was renamed the Bennington & Rutland (B&R) in 1865. When the Hoosac Tunnel in western Massachusetts was opened in 1875, the T&B gained a much shorter route to Boston and castoff the B&R. The B&R filed suit against the T&B; there was a small railroad war; and the B&R merged with the Lebanon Springs Railroad, a line that meandered north from Chatham, New York, to form the Harlem Extension Railroad — essentially a northward extension of what later became the Harlem Division of the New York Central Railroad (NYC). Vermont Central leased the Harlem Extension South, later Lebanon Springs, then Chatham & Lebanon Valley, and the Bennington & Rutland. The Rutland purchased the Bennington & Rutland in 1900 and the Chatham & Lebanon Valley in 1901.
Burlington-Ogdensburg route.
Ogdensburg, New York was at the eastern limit of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River navigation. A railroad between Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain was discussed as early as 1830 as part of a Boston-to-Great Lakes route, but it was 1850 before the Northern Railroad (of New York) was opened between Ogdensburg and Rouses Point, New York. It was extended east to connect with the Vermont & Canada in 1852, and it was reorganized as the Ogdensburg Railroad in 1858 and again as the Ogdensburg & Lake Champlain (O&LC) in 1864. A subsidiary, the Ogdensburg Transportation Company, operated a fleet of lake boats between Ogdensburg and Chicago. The O&LC was leased to the Vermont Central in 1870. Like the Rutland, it resumed independent operation after CV entered receivership in 1896. In 1901 the Rutland purchased the O&LC.
To connect the O&LC with its own line the Rutland chartered the Rutland & Canadian Railroad, which quickly constructed a line from Burlington to Rouses Point. The line used the islands at the north end of Lake Champlain as stepping stones; a causeway connected the islands with the mainland north of Burlington. The line was opened in 1901 and consolidated with the Rutland that same year.
By 1902 the Rutland extended to Chatham, New York, and Bellows Falls, Vermont, north through Rutland, where the two lines joined, to Burlington and then west through Rouses Point and Malone, New York, to Ogdensburg. It participated in Boston-Montreal and New York-Montreal passenger traffic and in conjunction with its navigation line on the Great Lakes it offered freight service between New England and Chicago. It did a good business carrying Boston- and New York-bound milk out of Vermont.
20th century.
Shortly after the turn of the century the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad (NYC&HR) and William Seward Webb, son-in-law of William H. Vanderbilt of the NYC&HR, began to buy Rutland stock. Webb became president of the Rutland in 1902, and by 1904 NYC interests owned more than half the capital stock of the Rutland. The railroad entered a period of NYC control and prosperity.
About the same time the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad (NH) acquired control of the New York, Ontario & Western Railway (NYO&W). The NH regarded New England as its own territory and was concerned with the NYC's acquisitions of the Boston & Albany Railroad and the Rutland; NYC for similar reasons was wary of NH's interest in the NYO&W. There was discussion of an exchange of subsidiaries. In 1911 the NH purchased half of the NYC interest, over protests of the Rutland's minority stakeholders, who recognized that NYC control was the best thing that had happened to the railroad in many years.
The Panama Canal Act of 1915 amended the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 to prohibit railroad ownership of a competing interstate water carrier. The Interstate Commerce Commission ruled that the Rutland's boats between Ogdensburg and Chicago competed with parent NYC. The boats were discontinued, and their traffic, which formed a large part of Rutland's freight business, wound up on NYC trains. Control by the United States Railroad Administration during World War I brought a great increase of traffic to the Rutland but at a considerable cost in deferred maintenance. Passenger traffic began to trickle away to the highways, and floods of 1927 washed out much of Rutland's line. The Rutland was strong enough financially to remain solvent through much of the Great Depression, but on May 5, 1938, the Rutland entered receivership. In the 1930s and 1940s the line operated long distance service between Montreal and New York City's Grand Central Terminal on the day "Green Mountain Flyer" train and the night "Mount Royal" train.
Economy measures, wage cuts, tax reductions, and a "Save the Rutland" Club kept the railroad going. Symbolic of the effort was a new Bellows Falls-Norwood, New York freight train, "The Whippet", for which the railroad streamstyled and painted a 1913-vintage 2-8-0. Many different reorganization plans were proposed and discussed, but it was more than 12 years before a new company emerged — the Rutland Railway, which came into existence on November 1, 1950. In 1952 the railroad received permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to cease passenger service on the line between Bennington and Chatham, New York. Passenger service ended in 1953. In the same year crews removed the track between Bennington and Chatham.
Heading the management committee of the new company was Gardner Caverly, a major bondholder. He scrapped of sidings and branches, and used the scrap value of Rutland's roster of steam locomotives and the worst of the freight cars as a down payment on 15 diesel locomotives. He scrapped the Bennington-Chatham line to pay for 450 new box cars, which wore yellow and green paint and a new herald, plus 70 gondolas and 27 hopper cars. A short strike in the summer of 1953 had the beneficial effect of ridding the Rutland of its passenger trains, which were expensive to operate and ran almost empty. The entire physical plant of the railroad was modernized and the labor force was thinned. In 1957 the Rutland paid a dividend on its preferred stock.
Labor dispute.
Through all of this, Rutland's employees were being paid less than the national standard, and in September 1960 they walked out. William Ginsburg, Caverly's successor, had cut all the costs he could; traffic, particularly milk, was declining, and the company had no cash reserve. An injunction brought the employees back to work 41 days after they struck, but the cooling-off period ended on September 25, 1961, and so did all service on the Rutland. Neither management nor labor would compromise, and on December 4, 1961, the Rutland petitioned for abandonment. Hearings and appeals went on for more than a year, but the Rutland was dead.
The state of Vermont bought the Burlington-Bennington-White Creek and Rutland-Bellows Falls lines. The Vermont Railway began operation on the former on January 6, 1964, and the Green Mountain Railroad began freight service between Bellows Falls and Rutland in April 1965 after a season of steam passenger operation on the line by the Steamtown, U.S.A. museum at Bellows Falls. Service resumed on the Norwood-Ogdensburg portion of the former O&LC in 1967 following its acquisition by the Ogdensburg Bridge & Port Authority.
Legacy.
Ownership of the railbed from Norwood to Burlington has been dispersed, but a section from Norwood to Moira is the multi-use Rutland Rail Trail.
The causeway between Burlington and South Hero built currently serves as a rail trail called The Island Line.
Future passenger service.
The Vermont Agency of Transportation is considering restoring passenger rail service along the Western Corridor between Rutland and Burlington, allowing the extension of "Ethan Allen Express" service to Burlington.

Ko Sai (เกาะทราย) is one of the West Coast Islands of Thailand. This island lies off the western side of the Gulf of Siam, about 2 km away from the shore.
Ko Sai is the largest of a small group of three rocky islets also known as "Pran Rocks", located off the fishing village of Khao Takiab, just south of Hua Hin. All this area belongs administratively to the Prachuap Khiri Khan Province.
Ko Sai has a maximum length of 0.4 km and its highest point reaches 35 m. Ko Sai vaguely looks like a sitting lion when seen from the shore. Local tour operators call it "Lion Island" (Ko Singto) and organize regular sightseeing and snorkeling excursions to visit this island group.
Two smaller islets are located close to Ko Sai:

Rhenohercynian Zone

The Rhenohercynian Zone or Rheno-Hercynian zone in structural geology describes a fold belt of west and central Europe, formed during the Hercynian orogeny (about ). The zone consists of folded and thrusted Devonian and early Carboniferous sedimentary rocks that were deposited in a back-arc basin along the southern margin of the then existing paleocontinent Laurussia.
The Rhenohercynian Zone, named for the Rhine River and the Hercynian Forest of Antiquity, forms a narrow zone through western and central Europe, from Cornwall and Ireland in the west to the Harz mountains of central Germany in the east, including the Rhenish Massif (Ardennes, Taunus, Eifel and Hunsrück). The total length of this ancient basin (the Rhenohercynian Basin) could have been more than 2500 km. In the east the basin merges with the East-Silesian basin of southern Poland. The sedimentary rocks that were laid down in the basin are often weakly metamorphic (greenschist facies). Most geologists consider the South-Portuguese zone to be a continuation of the zone to the west.
Whether the Rhenohercynian Basin was a continuous feature or rather a string of temporaneously interconnected smaller basins is not well-understood, because in many places the Devonian and Carboniferous rock strata are covered with younger deposits. Parts of the basin have their own names, like the "Cornwall basin" in Cornwall, the "Munster basin" in Ireland or the "Rhenisch basin" in Belgium and Germany.
Tectonic structure and metamorphism.
The Rhenohercynian Zone is a part of the northern foreland of the Hercynian orogeny. It has a lower grade of metamorphism than the Saxothuringian Zone to the south, meaning its rocks have generally been at smaller depths and under lower temperatures. The Subvariscan Zone north of the Rhenohercynian Zone was untouched by Hercynian metamorphism. During the Hercynian orogeny, the Rhenohercynian zone was folded and thrusted internally. It was thrust over the foreland to the north (the London-Brabant Massif and other Avalonian terranes). From the south it was overthrust by the Mid-German Crystalline High, part of the Saxothuringian Zone.
The metamorphic grade or degree of metamorphism increases towards the south or southeast. The southern edge of the Rhenish Massif lies in the Northern Phyllite Zone, which has a higher grade than other parts of the zone.
Geodynamic history.
The Devonian basin.
The Rhenohercynian basin was situated north of the Rheic Ocean, the ocean that spread between the continents of Laurussia (north) and Gondwana (south) from the Silurian onwards. The southern margin of Laurussia was formed during the Caledonian orogeny of the Silurian period, about 420 million years ago. In the Gedinnian/Lochkovian (Early Devonian) the southern part of the Caledonian mountain belt became a region of north-south extension. An elongated basin was formed parallel to the continental margin. It separated the London-Brabant Massif to the north from the Normannian and Mid-German Highs to the south.
In the Middle Devonian (from 390 million years ago) a subduction zone existed south of Laurussia, where oceanic lithosphere of the Rheic Ocean subducted beneath the Mid-German/Normannian highs. Volcanism above the subduction zone created a cordillera-type mountain chain, the Ligerian cordillera. In the Siegenian/Pragian and Emsian the Rhenohercynic basin was a back-arc basin behind this cordillera. Tectonic subsidence in a system of horsts and grabens together with basaltic volcanism resulted in the creation of new oceanic lithosphere. In the Middle Devonian a second basin, the Saxothuringian/Armorican basin, developed south of the Rhenohercynian basin. To the west some crustal convergence took place, and the Normannian High was partly thrust over the sedimentary basin fill of the Rhenohercynian basin.
Carboniferous compression.
The Rhenohercynian basin disappeared when the continent Gondwana collided with Laurussia in the course of the Carboniferous period (the Hercynian orogeny). The sedimentary rocks in the basin were thrust in a series of piggyback basins over the northern foreland (the London-Brabant Massif). These rocks now form the folded sequences of Cornwall, the Ardennes, the Eifel and the Harz.
From the Frasnian age (380 million years ago) the mafic volcanism ended, and the basin came locally under compressional stress, which led to folding and thrusting in the sedimentary rocks. Somewhere near the end of the Devonian, a subduction zone developed under the Mid-German/Normannian highs and Rhenohercynian crust began to subduct. This was the short Bretonnic phase of the Hercynian orogeny. It was followed, from the Tournaisian (early Carboniferous, 355 million years ago) till the end of the Visean by a new period of extension.
During the Sudetic (main) phase of the Hercynian orogeny (330-320 million years ago, Late-Visean and Namurian/Serpukhovian) compressional tectonics had the upper hand again. In the Namurian age full-scale continental collision between Laurussia and Gondwana resulted in the destruction of the last oceanic crust of the basin. Its sedimentary fill was, however, not (totally) subducted but instead thrust northward. During the later part of the Carboniferous period (Westphalian and Stephanian) the Rhenohercynian zone formed the foreland of a relatively fast-developing Hercynian mountainbelt to the south. Isostatic subsidence of the foreland resulted in the development of a deep foreland basin. This filled with the products of erosion in the Hercynian mountains and the contemporaneously uplifted London-Brabant Massif to the north. During the Westphalian, the basin was completely filled and rose above sea level.
Stratigraphy.
The Rhenohercynian basin was filled with Devonian and Carboniferous sediments. Sedimentation was often disrupted by tectonic phases, but nevertheless the total thickness of the sediments can in some places be more than several kilometers. 
When a foreland basin was formed in the Rhenohercynian zone, this was filled with upper Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) flysch and molasse sediments. The Namurian is characterized by flysch, in the Westphalian this gradually grades into molasse and other continental deposits, among which the thick coal layers of the Belgian coal measures.

Konopište, Macedonia

Konopište is a village in the Municipality of Kavadarci, situated in the center of the vinegary region of Tikveš. It is the home to Gorska Voda, a company that bottles water and soft drink products in the Republic of Macedonia. Konopište has many geomorphic stone dolls, but they were formed from a different geological process than the Stone Dolls found in Kratovo. Konopište is in the valley of both the Kožuf and Kozjak mountains and over 20 mountain rivers and streams flow through the area. Gorska gets its water from the Trnskot spring. 40 species of rare birds live in the area and a larger part of the Kožuf mountain and Tikveš region are part of a natural reserve protecting these endangered animals and their habitats. There is a colony of bald eagles that resides here, the only known colony in all of Europe. While many other animals make their habitat in the Konopište, only boar and rabbit hunting are permitted. Some natural resources and minerals are mined near here and have been since ancient times. Despite its natural wonder, very few people live in the village itself making the area one of the least populated in all of Macedonia. The village church St. Stefan has rare life-size icons that date back over 100 years, while the smaller and modern St. Atanas church is a nice edition to the village. Like many villages, there is a World War II monument to the fallen soldiers from the village. Roads to the village include from Kavadarci and Demir Kapija.

Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 1st rāgam in the 9th "chakra Brahma". The mnemonic name is "Brahma-Pa". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ra gu mi pa dha na". Its structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras in Carnatic music" for details on below notation and terms):
As it is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "prati madhyamam" equivalent of "Gayakapriya", which is the 13th "melakarta".
"Janya" rāgams.

Panchjanya (newspaper)

Panchjanya is an Indian weekly newspaper in Hindi, published by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.
Panchjanya was launched under the editorship of Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the auspicious Makara Sankranti day, 14 January 1948. The inaugural cover page copied a picture of Lord Krishna and the weekly boldly declared that its objective was to pursue idealism based on patriotism and to uphold the cultural heritage of India.
Political thinkers and literary figures such as Dr. Sampurnanand, Purushottam Das Tandon, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan, Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Mahadevi Verma, Amritlal Nagar, Kishori Das Bajpai and many other were among the galaxy of writers for Panchjanya.
Panchjanya has made efforts to generate a debate on national issues by publishing long interviews of political leaders representing different viewpoints such as Morarji Desai, Chowdhary Charan Singh, Chandra Shekhar Singh, Mulayam Singh, Sharad Yadav, A. B. Bardhan, Late M.A.Farooqi, D.Raja, Vasant Sathe, V.N.Gadgil, K. Karunakaran, Maulana Wahiduddin Khan etc. Experienced administrators such as Jagmohan and J.N.Dikshit, prominent journalists Arun Shourie and T. V. R. Shenoy and reputed names in literature and art like Narendra Kohli, Yamini Krishnamurthy and Sharda Ghate are regular contributors in Panchjanya. 
After Vajpayjee moved on to politics, he was succeeded by eminent editors like Rajiv Lochan Agnihotri, Gyanendra Saxena, Girish Chandra Mishra, Mahendra Kulashrestha, Tilak Singh Parmar, Yadav Rao, Vachnesh Tripathi, K. R. Malkani, Devendra Swaroop, Dinanath Mishra, Bhanu Pratap Shukla, Ram Shankar Agnihotri and Prabal Maitra. It is now edited by Baldeobhai Sharma. 
In 1995, the Audit Bureau of Circulation credited the magazine with a circulation of 85,000, a figure which Vijay claims has crossed the 1 lakh mark today.In Feb, 2008 Tarun Vijay gave his resignation from the post of Editor and now MR. Baldev sharma is the editor of Panchjanya.

1999 International Rules Series

The 1999 International Rules Series was the sixth annual International Rules Series and the second time that a test series of International rules football has been played between Ireland and Australia since the series resumed in 1998. 
The 1999 Series was played in Australia with a two-test series used to decide the winner. The first test was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the second test was played at Football Park in Adelaide. The 1999 Series was historic for the fact that a then record crowd of 64,326 turned up at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the first test followed by a strong 45,187 fans at the second test in Adelaide. The two combined crowds equalled to 109,513, smashing the opening record at the previous year's series in Ireland. 
The 2nd Test of the 1999 Series in Adelaide finished as a draw, the first time such a result occurred in the International Rules Series. 
Series overview.
The First Test was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in front of a then record crowd of 64,326. In a high scoring game, the Irish were victorious with McDermott scoring Ireland's only goal of the match. The Australians were not disgraced, finishing just 8 points behind the Irish at the end of the night with Nathan Buckley kicking 5 overs. The 2nd test provided a unique result. In a first for any International Rules game, the second test finished as a draw. Despite this, the Irish still won the series by 8 points on aggregate (their winning margian of the first test). Nathan Buckley again scored 5 overs, prompting many to pronounce him the Jim Stynes Medal winner. Michael O'Loughlin and Shane Crawford each scored a goal each whilst for the Irish, McDermott and Tohill gained scores of 7 in front of over 45,000 people at Football Park in Adelaide. Ireland won the series 122-114 on aggregate.

The towers were three-stories high and were roofed with gables. The church was probably donated by wealthy patrons.

Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina

The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Serbo-Croatian: "Sud Bosne i Hercegovine", Cyrillic script: Суд Босне и Херцеговине; abbreviated as the "Court of BiH" in English) is a domestic court of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina which includes international judges and prosecutors. It was established on 3 July 2002 by the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Law on the Court of BiH and promulgated on 12 November 2000 by the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is based in Sarajevo ("88 Kraljice Jelene street") was necessary to provide for judicial protection in the matters that under the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina fall under the jurisdiction of the Court of BiH, such as fight against terrorism, war crimes, human trafficking, organized and economic crimes. Also, with the aim of establishing the rule of law, it is important to underline the role of the Court of BiH, which will also work on the harmonization of standards in court proceedings.
The Court is a judicial body which does not have a time-limited mandate. Unlike the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia whose work is regulated by the Statute issued by the UN Security Council and the Rulebook adopted by the ICTY judges, the Court of BiH hands down verdicts in accordance with the laws of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as the BiH Criminal Code and the BiH Criminal Procedure Code. Besides the fact that the international judges and prosecutors work at the Court of BiH and the Prosecutor's Office of BiH, the key functions are held by the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Trials are conducted in one of the official languages of BiH in accordance with the national laws, while the convicted persons serve their time in prisons in BiH.
Competencies of the Court of BiH.
The competencies of the Court of BiH are regulated by the Law on the Court of BiH and are related to criminal, administrative and appellate jurisdiction. 
Within its criminal jurisdiction, the Court of BiH tries cases pertaining to the crimes laid down by the laws of BiH, which include war crimes, organized crime, economic crime and corruption cases. 
Administrative jurisdiction means that the Court of BiH adjudicates cases pertaining to the decisions issued by BiH institutions and other organizations in charge of public functions, such as property disputes related to the performance of public functions between the States and the Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, breaches of the election law, etc.
However, the Court of BiH does not act on appeals from decisions issued by Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina courts.
Divisions and Sections.
There are three Divisions within the Court of BiH: Criminal, Administrative and Appellate. The Criminal Division contains: Section I – War Crimes Chamber; Section II – Organized Crime, Economic Crime and Corruption and Section III – General Crime.
The Appellate Division rules on appeals against decisions made within the Criminal and Administrative divisions, decides on complaints related to the breaches of the Election Law, as well in other cases as provided by the laws of BiH. 
Within the Court of BiH there exists the Registry for War Crimes and Organized Crime, Economic Crime and Corruption.
The Common Secretariat provides administrative support to the General Crime Section and the Administrative Division.
The role of the Registry is to provide the Court of BiH with the conditions for its efficient work by rendering administrative support to Sections I and II for War Crimes and Organized Crime.
The President of the Court and his/her role.
The High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council appoints the President of the Court of BiH. President of the Court of BiH is one of the Judges appointed to the Court of BiH, who must possess the required managerial and organizational skills important for the work of the Court of BiH. President is appointed to a mandate of six (6) years and can be reappointed. 
The responsibilities of the President of the Court are regulated by the Law on the Court of BiH and internal acts of the Court. President of the Court, "inter alia", has the following responsibilities:
Appointment of the judges.
According to the Law, the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council appoints Judges including the President of the Court of BiH, lay judges and additional judges to the Court of BiH. The HJPC advertises job vacancies, and then decides on the appointment. Judges of the Court of BiH must have at least eight years of experience as judges, prosecutors, attorneys or other relevant legal experience following the bar exam, and are appointed for life, having in mind the fact that their term in office may cease in case they resign or reach the age limit which is obligatory for retirement, or in case they are removed from office for the reasons stipulated in the Law.
Appointment of international judges and prosecutors.
The Registry manages the process of appointing and engaging international judges who are appointed to Section I and the Section II of the Criminal and Appeal divisions, as well as international prosecutors who are appointed to the Special Departments.
After a joint recommendation of the President of the Court of BiH and the President of the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council, the High Representative appoints international judges. After a joint recommendation of the Chief Prosecutor of BiH, the President of the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council and the Registry, the High Representative appoints international prosecutor. International judges and prosecutors are appointed by the High Representative by the powers vested in him by Article 5, Annex 10, of the Dayton Peace Accord. 
There are 42 national and 16 international judges.
The budget of the Court of BiH.
The total amount allocated in the national budget for the Court of BiH in 2006 equates to 5,328,800 Bosnia and Herzegovina konvertibilna marka. The funds are being used for salaries, allowances and other reimbursements for the judges and administrative support staff, their travel allowances, office costs, building and equipment maintenance, legal and professional fees and other purposes.
In addition to this amount, the international community has donated approximately EUR 10 million in 2006 to support the work of the Court of BiH and the Prosecutor’s Office of BiH, particularly the work of the Special Department for War Crimes and Special Department for Organised Crimes as well as the work of the International Registry.
The Registry has contributed to the Court of BiH in the form of maintenance and capital expenditures such as equipment, construction works and similar. The amount of EUR 10 million also covers the expenses related to the engagement of the international judges, legal advisors and prosecutors. That amount is pledged through the international donations and managed separately from the budget of the state institutions.
It is planned that the integration process, i.e. the process of transferring financial responsibility form the Registry budget to the budgets of BiH will start in 2006. In practical terms this means the transfer of the staff from the Registry to their appropriate BiH budget, during 2006 to 2009.
The difference between the Court of BiH and the ICTY.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is an "ad hoc" tribunal, which has a limited existence, and which was established to hand down verdicts for serious violations of international humanitarian law and for war crimes committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. This fact limits the mandate of the ICTY so that it can deliver judgments only for the most responsible persons who committed war crimes, in accordance with the time-frame and criteria for issuing the indictment as defined by the ICTY Prosecution (OTP).
The Registry.
The Registry of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian: "Ured registrara") was established on 1 December 2004 for a five-year period through "Agreement between the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bosnia and Herzegovina on the Establishment of the Registry for Section I for War Crimes and Section II for Organized Crime, Economic Crime and Corruption of the Criminal and Appellate Divisions of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Special Department for War Crimes and the Special Department for Organized Crime, Economic Crime and Corruption of the Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina".
The mandate of the Registry is to manage and provide administrative, legal and other support services to Section I for War Crimes and Section II for Organized Crime, Economic Crime and Corruption of the Criminal and Appellate Divisions of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as to provide support services to Special Departments of the Prosecutor’s Office, which include, but are not limited to, support to international judges and prosecutors in their work. The support services range from organizing and coordinating, in cooperation with relevant national authorities, of detention related activities, criminal defence and support to and protection of witnesses.
The Registry is located in the same premises as the Court of BiH and Prosecutor’s Office. The Registry currently employs around 270 staff.
Common Secretariat.
The Common Secretariat is responsible for the administration and the provision of support services to Section III of the Criminal and Appellate Divisions and the Administrative Division. The Common Secretariat is managed by a Chief Registrar, assisted by two officers. 
The Common Secretariat includes the "Department for legal, general, administrative and technical support affairs", the "Department for financial-material affairs", and the "Court Sections Legal Support Service".

<doc id="19957517" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19957517" title="Great Oyster Bay">
Great Oyster Bay

Great Oyster Bay is a broad and sheltered bay on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia which opens onto the Tasman Sea. The Tasman Highway runs close to the West Coast of the bay with spectacular views of the rugged granite peaks of the Hazards and Schouten Island of the Freycinet Peninsula which are incorporated in the Freycinet National Park.
Main towns on the bay include Swansea and Coles Bay. 
At the north of the bay the floodplains of the Aspley and Swan rivers has created Moulting Lagoon, an important Ramsar-listed wetland, much of which lies in the Moulting Lagoon Game Reserve. Nearby is the Friendly Beaches Reserve owned and managed by Bush Heritage Australia (BHA).
History.
Prior to European settlement the area was occupied by Tasmanian Aborigines. From autumn through winter various bands of the Oyster Bay Tribe congregated around the coastal areas to harvest shellfish and marine vegetables until the end of July, when swans and ducks arrived in the lagoons and riverine areas to lay their eggs and raise their young. In August most of the bands moved up the Little Swanport and Prosser Rivers to the Eastern Marshes to hunt birds, kangaroos and wallabies. The Linetemairrener people lived at the lagoon year round.
Activities.
Activities include sea kayaking in the sheltered waters on the east side of the bay from Coles Bay exploring the many small and isolated beaches on the Freycinet Peninsula. Recreational fishing is also popular activity in the bay with flathead, Australian salmon, trevally, trumpeter and squid regularly caught. Dolphins and Australian Fur Seals can often be seen and whales often frequent the bay in winter.
Aquaculture has been practiced in the area since the early 1970s. Species cultivated commercially include Pacific oysters, native oysters, mussels, scallops, abalone and sea urchins in the Great Oyster Bay and Mercury Passage. An initial marine farming lease set up in 1978 in Pelican Bay, with additional leases granted for shellfish culture since then in the northern section of Great Oyster Bay and the Swan River.
Infestations.
Infestations of rice grass has been reported as a problem by Oyster Farmers from Little Swanport in 2008 with swift action being taken to eliminate this ecological threat in the area.
Access to most of the Friendly Beaches Reserve is restricted due to the threat of contamination by the soil pathogen Cinnamon Fungus.

Wally (Wallabies mascot)

Wally is the name of the official mascot of the Australian rugby union team - the Wallabies. As his name implies, Wally is a Wallaby. The stuffed version of the mascot is carried with the Wallabies on overseas tours to Europe. It then becomes the duty of the youngest member of the touring party to protect the mascot from pranks by older players to hide and sabotage it. It is considered an embarressment to the protector if Wally is not safely guarded. For example when Berrick Barnes was forced to protect Wally during the 2007 World Cup in France he had to stitch it up several times and perform a search of every member's hotel room to retrieve it - despite the help of Lote Tuqiri. As the protector is forced to hold Wally at all times it becomes a source of entertainment for senior players when the team is out socialising. During the 2008 tour it became a long-running joke among the players that the mascot could be used by 18 year old James O'Connor to break the ice with young ladies. 
In May 2007 a Welsh rugby fan was ejected from a stadium in Sydney during a match for attempting to dance with the life size version of Wally.

Denofa

Denofa AS, established in 1912 as De Nordiske Fabriker A/S (De-No-Fa for short), is a Norwegian industrial company. It has produced oil, proteins and fatty acid (lecithin) for the food processing industry, the fodder industry and the pharmaceutical industry. Starting with whale oil as a basis for refinement, the use of soy later became more widespread.
The company was established on 10 May 1912. The first board consisted of P. Bogen, Joh. Gmeiner, Hugo Wetlesen, Carl Dietrich Hildisch, Helge Offerdahl and Wilhelm Nicolaysen. The first production facility was located in Fredrikstad, planned and constructed by Carl Fredrik Holmboe. In 1923 Holmboe became chief executive officer. De-No-Fa launched a cooperation with the soap company Lilleborg in 1925, and eventually acquired it as a daughter company. Later, a 50% stake in the company was bought by Unilever (formerly Lever Brothers), where Carl Fredrik Holmboe was chief engineer prior to his period in De-No-Fa. Holmboe left the CEO position in 1946.
In 1959 Unilever's stake was bought by Borregaard. In 1960 De-No-Fa and Lilleborg was merged to form DeNoFa Lilleborg. The company owned Stabburet from 1969 to 1985. The year after that, Borregaard was acquired by the Orkla Group. Lilleborg was demerged in 1996 to again form a separate company, but remained a part of the Orkla Group. In 2005, 40% of Denofa was bought by Unikorn. Orkla now owns 20%, while the remaining 40% are owned by the Brazilian company Inlogs. In addition, Denofa owns 60% of the Polish company Nagrol. Denofa has also been active in Russia, and opened a sales office in Romania in 1996.
In addition to Fredrikstad, Denofa also owns a production facility in Leknes, acquired after buying 100% of the company Marine Lipids. In 2004 it was decided to close the fat refinery in Fredrikstad. At that time the plant employed 120 people, already downsized from 450 over a fifteen-year period. The extraction plant (nicknamed "X-verket") with 70 employees, located adjacent to the fat refinery, was also threatened with closing. However, it was retained following the influx of fresh capital from Unikorn. The changes marked a stronger leaning towards soy. The soybeans are imported from Brazil; in addition grain from Norway is used.
The company currently has 60 employees, and the current CEO is Bjarne Rask Thomsen
