Thomas Paton

Sir Thomas Angus Lyall Paton CMG, FRS, BSc FASCE FIStructE MICE (10 May 1905–7 April 1999) was a British civil engineer from Jersey. He was commonly known by his second name, Angus. Paton was born into a family that had founded the civil engineering firms of Easton, Gibb & Son and Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners and he would spend his entire professional career working for the latter. Following his graduation from University College London one of his first jobs was the construction of a dam in Maentwrog in Wales. Paton later became an expert on dams and much of his career was devoted to their construction. In 1931 he undertook an economic survey of Canada which recommended a programme of works for its port system. This report was still being used into the 1970s. During the Second World War Paton was involved with the construction of gun emplacements in the Dardanelles, Turkey and of caissons for the Mulberry Harbours used after the Invasion of Normandy.
After the Second World War, Paton undertook an economic survey of Syria, which made recommendations for port, water infrastructure, irrigation and hydroelectric improvements. This was followed by a similar report on Lebanon and one on the possibility of extending railways from Northern Rhodesia to neighbouring countries. From 1946, Paton worked almost exclusively on hydroelectric projects, beginning with the Owen Falls Hydroelectric Scheme in Uganda. He also worked on the Kariba Dam in Zambia and Zimbabwe, which was the largest dam in the world when built and for which he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. He was also involved with the Indus Basin Project, the Aswan High Dam, the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam, the P.K. Le Roux Dam, the Spioenkop Dam and the Tarbela Dam. Paton was knighted in 1973 and retired in 1977, remaining a senior consultant to Gibb and Partners. He spent his retirement in Jersey, where he died at St Helier on 7 April 1999. Paton was dedicated to his professional career and served as President of both the Institution of Civil Engineers (November 1970 - November 1971) and the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers.
Early life.
Paton was born on the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands on the 10 May 1905. His father, Thomas Lyall Paton, was a journalist and author. His mother, Janet, was the daughter of Easton Gibb, founder of Easton, Gibb & Son, a firm of civil engineering contractors. His uncle on his mother's side, Alexander Gibb, was also a civil engineer; and had founded Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, where Paton would spend his professional career. Paton left Jersey with his family in 1909 and spent a year in England before being sent to school in Boulogne-sur-Mer in France then Lausanne in Switzerland. He returned to England at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. He spent the next six years living in St Leonards-on-Sea in Sussex where he lived next door to his future wife, Joan Delme-Murray.
Paton spent four years at Brunswick preparatory school in Haywards Heath, Sussex before studying at Cheltenham College. He was a good student, which he put down to an excellent maths teacher, a good memory and being "not much good at games". On Alexander Gibb's advice Paton read for a degree in civil engineering at University College London (UCL), where he had won a scholarship at the age of 17. Whilst at UCL Paton earned half-colours for long distance running and became the only student to graduate with a first class honours Bachelor of Sciences degree in engineering in 1925.
Work.
Post-graduation.
Upon graduation Paton joined Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, which had been founded in 1922. One of his first jobs there was to assist with the design of a new jetty for Barking Power Station. In 1927 he worked on a dam at Maentwrog in North Wales and between 1932 and 1933 was resident engineer on the Glenlee portion of the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme. Paton was seconded to the Rangoon Port Trust in 1930 to construct a wharf for the export of Lead from Burma. This wharf survived a serious earthquake on 5 May 1930 and was opened on 20 February 1931. On 10 April 1931 Paton sailed to Canada to undertake a survey of its ports and outline the additional facilities that would be required in the next 25–50 years. He was assisted in this for six weeks by Ralph Freeman who had designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The report was issued on 15 January 1932 but was not implemented until 1935 with the election of William Lyon Mackenzie King as Prime Minister of Canada. The report's findings continued to be in use until the 1970s. Paton was responsible for the construction of a new brewery for Guinness in Park Royal, London from October 1933 to October 1936. This was the biggest job of his career thus far and involved the construction of seven steel framed buildings, a power station, a storage silo, roads and railway sidings. Paton also built industrial and trading estates in Wales, West Cumberland and London. He was made a partner in the firm in 1938.
Second World War.
During the Second World War the running of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb and Partners gained a large number of government contracts and within a few weeks of the start of the war in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium Hydroxide from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a £7 million underground aircraft engine factory. From 1943-44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the precast concrete caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944-45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford.
Post-war.
In 1945 Paton began construction of a wool factory at Darlington and a Rayon factory at Carrickfergus, both jobs were completed in 1951. In 1946 Paton was put in charge of an economic survey of Syria which required him to traverse the country by aircraft and car. The report, issued in 1947, recommended port, water infrastructure and irrigation improvements and the construction of a hydroelectric power station on the Euphrates River. Paton undertook a similar survey in Lebanon from 1947 to 1948. He was also involved in a report on the possibility of running a railroad from Northern Rhodesia to Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Nyasaland.
Paton worked extensively in the field of hydroelectric power and became regarded as a world authority on the matter. From 1946 to 1955 he worked on the Owen Falls Hydroelectric Scheme in Uganda which resulted in the complete stoppage of the White Nile for the first time in history. Following the completion of Owen Falls Dam, Paton worked on the first stage of the Kariba Dam on the Zambezi River, of which he said that it was the "highlight of professional career". Paton made 22 visits to the site, of a total duration of 267 days. The project itself was, at 420 ft high, the largest dam built until then and, despite some of the worst floods on record hitting the project, was completed in 1960 at £5 million under budget. In recognition of his work on the Kariba project Paton was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1960. As a result of the success of the Kariba project Gibb and Partners became involved with many of the biggest dam projects of the next two decades including works in Sudan, Argentina, South Africa and Pakistan.
Paton was later involved in the second stage of the Kariba Project and in the Aswan High Dam project. In 1955 he became a senior partner in Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners upon the death of Alistair Gibb in a polo accident. From 1960 until 1977, when he retired, Paton was the responsible partner for the firm's involvement in the supervision of the $1.2 billion World Bank Indus Basin Project. This included the construction of the Mangla Dam between 1962 and 1968.
In 1962 Gibb & Partners was one of two firms chosen (with Coyne et Bellier) by the South African government to build two dams on the Orange River. The first to be constructed was the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam which was officially opened in March 1972. The second, the P.K. Le Roux Dam, was finished in 1977. Following the success of this project Paton was retained to build a third, smaller dam, the Spioenkop Dam, which was finished in 1972. Paton was also involved with the tunnelling and underground powerhouse for the Drakensberg Pumped Storage Scheme. Paton was retained by the World Bank once more in 1967 to supervise the construction of the Tarbela Dam in Pakistan, which was completed in 1976. He also worked on the modernisation of the Royal Mint which involved the move from its 600-year home at Tower Hill to Llantrisant in Wales in time for decimalisation in 1971.
Retirement.
Paton retired from the firm in 1977 but worked for them again as a senior consultant between 1979 and 1985. During this time he worked on the James Bay Project, a large hydroelectric and infrastructure development in Quebec, Canada. Paton spent the last twenty years of his life in retirement in Jersey in the Channel Islands. In his working life he had visited 48 countries and spent 3152 days abroad. During his career with Gibb and Partners he had grown the company from a 400 employee, home-based company to one which employed more than 1500 engineers working in 63 countries. He was also largely responsible for leading the trend of exporting British technical expertise around the world.
Paton made an endowment to the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1986, as a result the Academy awards the Sir Angus Paton Bursary of £7000 annually to a masters student. Paton married on 7 June 1933 to Joan with whom he raised two daughters and two sons. Joan died on 7 January 1964, an event which spurred him to become more involved in his profession. Paton died at St Helier in Jersey on 7 April 1999.
Professional recognition.
Institutional and committee memberships.
In addition to his busy work schedule Paton served his profession on numerous councils and committees. The first of these was as chairman of the Association of Consulting Engineers between 1949 and 1950, an association of which he was made an honorary member in 1984. Paton served on the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1954 to 1959 and again from 1961 to 1966. He was elected vice president of that institution, a position he filled from 1966 to 1970 when he was elected president. Whilst serving as president he started "New Civil Engineer" magazine to keep members up to date with civil engineering news.
From 1960 to 1965 Paton was a board member of the Hydraulics Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and from 1964 to 1975 he served on the council of the Construction Industry Research and Information Association. Paton was also the British representative on the committee of the International Commission on Large Dams between 1966 to 1973. From 1968 to 1970 he was chairman of the National Economic Development Council's working party on large industrial construction sites and from 1969 to 1974 was a member of the Natural Environment Research Council. Paton was vice-chairman of the Council of Engineering Institutions from 1971 to 1972 and chairman for 1972 to1973. From 1974 to 1979 he was chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food flood protection research committee. Paton was also a member emeritus of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers and served as their president in 1980.
Other honours.
Paton was awarded many honours for his contributions to civil engineering. In 1952 he was made an honorary fellow of University College London and he was also a fellow of the Institution of Structural Engineers and the American Society of Civil Engineers. Paton was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1969 and served as one of its vice-presidents for the 1977-78 session. Paton became one of the few practising engineers to have held that post.
He was created a knight bachelor in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1973 in recognition of his services to the construction industry. This knighthood was personally conferred upon him by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 November 1973. In 1976 Paton became a founding member of the Fellowship of Engineering and received an honorary Doctorate of Science (DSc) in engineering from the University of London in 1977. In 1978 he was made an honorary fellow of Imperial College London and received another honorary DSc in engineering from Bristol University.

A Fish out of Water (book)

A Fish out of Water is a 1961 American children's book written by Helen Palmer Geisel (credited as Helen Palmer) and illustrated by P. D. Eastman. The book is based on a short story by Palmer's husband Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), "Gustav, the Goldfish", which was published with his own illustrations in "Redbook" magazine in June 1950.
Plot.
The story is about a boy who buys a fish, named Otto, from a pet store. The store owner, Mr. Carp, gives the boy instructions on how to care for the fish, including strict feeding instructions: "Never feed him a lot. Never more than a spot! Or something may happen. You never know what." When the boy ignores these instructions out of compassion for his new pet, Otto begins to outgrow his fishbowl. This leads the boy to move him into several different vases and a bathtub until the house fills up with water.
The boy requests help from a police officer and the fire department, who help him take Otto down to the local pool. There, they drop the fish in, causing it to expand to the size of the pool and scare off all of the swimmers. Unsure of what to do, the boy calls Mr. Carp. He is not surprised as boys always ignore his feeding instructions. When Mr. Carp arrives, he dives into the pool and pulls Otto below. Eventually, he emerges with the fish, back to its normal size. He refuses to say how he did it but tells the boy to never overfeed Otto again, and the boy takes his advice to heart.
Background.
"Gustav, the Goldfish", the short story that served as the basis for this book, was written and illustrated by Dr. Seuss and published in the June 1950 edition of "Redbook" magazine as the first installment in his series of children's stories for "Redbook". This story has much in common with "A Fish Out of Water", including its plot and characters. However, the goldfish's name is Gustav instead of Otto, and the pet shop owner's name is Mr. VanBuss instead of Mr. Carp. The original story was collected, along with six other Dr. Seuss stories originally published in magazines, in the 2011 collection "The Bippolo Seed and Other Lost Stories".
In 1959, in a letter to his wife, he gave her formal permission to write a book for the Beginner Books series based on his original story, writing, "You have the right to use any of the situations or any of the words from the original story that your little heart desires. You must, however, comply with all necessary steps in protecting my original copyright." Palmer's work involved, in part, rewriting and simplifying the original text to comply with Beginner Books' policies. She finished "A Fish Out of Water" in 1961 at the Hotel Madison in New York City, where she and her husband were staying for six weeks as their home in La Jolla, California, was being remodeled. She had apparently been working at it steadily, as she jokingly described this last revision as "the 9,373th version" of the book.

Second Stanhope Ministry

The Second Stanhope Ministry was the ninth ministry of the Government of the Australian Capital Territory, and was led by Labor Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and his deputies Ted Quinlan (2004–2006) and Katy Gallagher (2006–2008). It was sworn in on 4 November 2004, following the Labor government's landslide re-election at the 2004 election. The retirement of veteran member Bill Wood at the election created a vacancy in the ministry, and backbencher John Hargreaves, who had polled exceptionally well at the election, was appointed to fill the position.
There were several changes during the term of this ministry. The first, albeit minor, changes in March 2005 saw Deputy Chief Minister Quinlan pick up several new portfolios. A much greater change occurred in April 2006 when Quinlan's retirement from politics sparked a major reshuffle and the appointment of a new minister in Andrew Barr. A final change occurred in April 2007, when Simon Corbell was stripped of his responsibilities for planning after publicly criticising Chief Minister Stanhope over his handling of the area, and Stanhope chose to reactivate an environment and climate change ministry.
The ministry was replaced by the Third Stanhope Ministry after the Labor government's re-election at the 2008 election.
First arrangement.
This covers from the period from 4 November 2004 (when the ministry was sworn in) until 20 April 2006. There was one minor change during this term when, six months later on 2 March 2005, additional ministries were added to Quinlan's responsibilities, covering the ministries of business, tourism, sport and recreation and racing and gaming. This arrangement continued until the retirement of Ted Quinlan that resulted in a major reshuffle of the ministry, and the appointment of Andrew Barr to fill the subsequent vacancy, as outlined in the second arrangement.
Second arrangement.
This covers the period from 20 April 2006, when Andrew Barr was sworn in following the retirement of Ted Quinlan, through until the swearing in of the Third Stanhope Ministry following the Labor government's re-election at the 2008 election. There was one minor change during this term when, twelve months later on 17 April 2007, Stanhope assumed the expanded ministry of environment, water and climate change; the ministry for children and young people was restored to Gallagher's responsibilities; and the planning ministry transferred from Corbell to Barr.

Treaty of Prenzlau

Treaty of Prenzlau or Peace of Prenzlau () may refer to several treaties during a series of wars between the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Pomerania fought for control of Pomerania-Stettin, and possession of the Uckermark in the 15th century. The First Peace of Prenzlau ended a war fought between 1445 and 1448, while the Second Peace of Prenzlau ended a war fought between 1466 and 1468. In older documents, Prenzlau may be spelled "Prenzlow", which was the common spelling during the time period the treaties were drawn and was only changed during the 19th century. Prenzlau is situated in the center of Uckermark.
First Peace of Prenzlau (1448).
After a series of conflicts, the Brandenburgian margraves and the Pomeranian dukes partitioned the Uckermark with the Treaty of Prenzlau (1448). The southern parts should belong to Brandenburg, while the northern parts stayed with Pomerania. The northern parts were to be inherited by Brandenburg in case the House of Pomerania would extinct. The peace treaty was prepared already in 1447 and signed on May 3, 1448.
Second Peace of Prenzlau (1472, 1479).
War started again when Stettin (Szczecin) refused to hail the Brandenburgian margraves, which it was supposed to following the Treaty of Soldin (1466). Brandenburg responded by attacking the Pomeranian duchy and advanced deep into Pomerania-Stettin, which before the war included the Uckermark.
Most of the fighting in this war was ended by a truce, the treaty of Prenzlau (1468): Brandenburg thereby kept the southern Uckermark gained in the course of the war from Pomerania. The truce concluded in September 1468 was prolonged in 1469 in Petrikau.
The Second Treaty of Prenzlau (1472) was a peace treaty signed on May 31, 1472 between Albert III, Elector of Brandenburg, and the Dukes of Pomerania. Based on the terms of the accord, the dukes Eric II and Wartislaw X surrendered the Duchy of Pomerania-Stettin to Albert III, with the Uckermark becoming an integral part of Brandenburg and the remainder of Pomerania-Stettin becoming a Brandenburgian vassal. This accord was confirmed by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III in 1473.
A third treaty of Prenzlau (1479) confirmed the 1472 one.

Meare Pool

Meare Pool (also known as Ferlingmere, Ferran Mere or Meare fish pool) was a lake in the Somerset Levels in South West England.
Meare Pool was formed by water ponding-up behind the raised peat bogs between the Wedmore and the Polden Hills, and coring has shown that it is filled with at least of detritus mud, especially in the Subatlantic climatic period (1st millennium BC).
In prehistoric times there were two Meare Lake Villages situated within the lake, occupied at different times between 300 BCE and 100 CE, similar to the nearby Glastonbury Lake Village. The Meare villages were discovered in 1895 but excavation did not start until 1908. More recent studies have shown that the villages were formed by laying dried clay over the Sphagnum Moss of the bog. The pool at that time was at least long by wide.
Early drainage work was carried out in the later years of the 12th century, with the responsibility for maintaining all the watercourses between Glastonbury and the sea being placed on named individuals among whom were Ralph de Sancta Barbara of Brentmarsh. Drainage of the surrounding area by monks of Glastonbury Abbey had reduced the size of the lake to at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Meare Pool had disappeared from maps by 1749.
In World War II a pillbox was located at Meare Pool at the confluence of the Decoy Rhyne and Whitelake River.
Location.
Meare Pool was located on low-lying levels just north of Meare. Its precise boundaries varied according to season, and, over the longer term, as efforts were made to drain the area. The south end was bordered by the high ground that the village of Meare is built upon. The pond would have extended no further west than the current Westhay to Wedmore road, where a shelf of rock formed a natural boundary. To the north lies the Godney ridge. The eastern extent is harder to determine, and it may have gone as far as the site of the Glastonbury Lake Village.
Current Ordnance Survey maps show Meare Pool as a placename in an area with spot heights of 4m.
Fishery.
In the Domesday book of 1086 the village of Meare is recorded as supporting "10 fishermen and 3 fisheries paying 20 pence". At the time of the Dissolution in 1540, Meare Pool was said to contain a great abundance of pike, tench, roach and eels. In 1638 it was owned by William Freake, who described it as "lately a fish pool".
In the 14th century a Fish House was built at Meare for the chief fisherman of the Abbot of Glastonbury that was also used for salting and preparing fish. It is the only surviving monastic fishery building in England. The importance of this industry is illustrated by a series of acrimonious disputes between Glastonbury and the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral. The Abbey required fish on Fridays, fast days and during Lent. As many as 5000 eels were landed in a typical year.
There were also three fishponds which would have allowed fish to have been bred or stored.
Drainage.
In early times the Meare Pool collected the waters of the rivers Brue and Sheppey, and discharged in a northerly direction into the Lower River Axe. In the later years of the 12th century the Abbey diverted the Brue to flow westwards, perhaps largely through natural channels, from Meare Pool to join the river Parrett. Further reclamation was carried out in stages between about 1620 and 1740, with the "new Cutts" (or Decoy Rhyne) being built about 1660. The rivers Sheppey and Hartlake were canalised into the River James Wear and Division Rhyne sometime in the late 1730s.

Capture of Gibraltar

The Capture of Gibraltar by the forces of the Grand Alliance occurred between 1–3 August 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession. Since the beginning of the war the Alliance had been looking for a harbour in the Iberian Peninsula to control the Strait of Gibraltar and facilitate naval operations against the French fleet in the western Mediterranean Sea. An attempt to seize Cádiz had ended in failure in September 1702, but following the Alliance fleet's success at Vigo Bay in October that year the combined fleets of the 'Maritime Powers', the Netherlands and England, had emerged as the dominant naval force in the region. This strength helped persuade King Peter II of Portugal to sever his alliance with France and Bourbon controlled Spain, and ally himself with the Grand Alliance in 1703. Now with access to the Portuguese port of Lisbon the Alliance fleets could campaign in the Mediterranean, and conduct operations in support of the Austrian Habsburg candidate to the Spanish throne, the Archduke Charles, known to his supporters as Charles III of Spain. 
Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt represented the Habsburg cause in the region. In June 1704 the Prince and Admiral George Rooke, commander of the main Grand Alliance fleet, failed to take Barcelona in the name of 'Charles III'; Rooke subsequently evaded pressure from his allies to make another attempt on Cádiz. However, in order to compensate for their lack of success the Alliance commanders resolved to capture Gibraltar, a small town on the southern Spanish coast. Following a heavy bombardment the town was invaded by English and Dutch marines and sailors. The governor, Diego de Salinas, and its small garrison on 3 August. Three days later Prince George entered the town with Austrian and Spanish Habsburg troops in the name of Charles III of Spain. However, the Grand Alliance failed in its objective of replacing Philip V with Charles III as King of Spain but in the peace negotiations Gibraltar was ceded to Britain. 
Background.
At the start of the War of the Spanish Succession Portugal was nominally an ally of the Bourbons: France under Louis XIV, and Spain under his grandson, Philip V. Although she was not a belligerent Portugal's harbours were closed to the enemies of the Bourbon powers – principally the vessels of England and the Dutch Republic. However, following the Anglo-Dutch naval victory at Vigo Bay in 1702 the balance of naval forces had swung in favour of the Grand Alliance. Having now the ability to cut off Portugal's food supplies and trade (particularly gold from Brazil) it was not hard for the Allied diplomats to induce King Peter II to sign the Methuen Treaties of May 1703 and join the Alliance. Once Peter II had committed himself to war the Alliance fleets gained access to Portugal's harbours, in particular the port of Lisbon. In return for his allegiance Peter II had demanded military and financial aid and territorial concessions in Spain; he had also asked that the Alliance to send to Lisbon Emperor Leopold I's younger son, Charles – the Alliance's Habsburg candidate to the Spanish throne – to demonstrate the earnestness of their support. Known to his supporters as Charles III of Spain, the young pretender arrived in Lisbon – via London – with George Rooke's fleet on 7 March 1704, amid great celebrations.
Apart from the failed Grand Alliance attempt take Cádiz in 1702, and the subsequent attack on the Spanish treasure fleet in Vigo Bay, the war had thus far been limited to the Low Countries and Italy. With Portugal's change of allegiance, however, the war moved towards Spain. In May 1704 the court at Lisbon received news that French and Spanish troops had crossed the frontier into Portugal. This army of approximately 26,000 men under Philip V and the Duke of Berwick scored several victories on the border: Salvaterra fell on 8 May, Penha Garcia on 11 May, Philip V personally oversaw the fall of Castelo Branco on 23 May, and T'Serclaes captured Portalegre on 8 June. But without supply for their forces, the coming summer heat made it impossible for them to continue with the campaign, and Philip V returned to Madrid on 16 July to a heroes welcome. However, the heat did not affect the war at sea where the Alliance was in a position of strength.
Prelude.
Using Lisbon as an improvised forward base Admiral Rooke’s Anglo-Dutch fleet ventured into the Mediterranean Sea in May 1704. After seeing the Levant trading fleet safely through the Strait of Gibraltar Rooke headed towards Nice to put himself in touch with Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy. The Grand Alliance had planned for a naval attack upon the French base at Toulon in conjunction with the Savoyard army and the rebels of the Cévennes; but with Amadeus busy defending his capital Turin from French forces, the Toulon expedition was abandoned and Rooke sailed for the Catalonian capital, Barcelona. 
Accompanying Rooke was Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt who had enjoyed popularity amongst the Catalans as their governor at the end of the Nine Years' War. The Prince was the great exponent of the Barcelona plan; he had been in touch with the dissidents within Catalonia and counted on the appearance of the fleet to encourage a rising in favour of 'Charles III'. On 30 May, under cover of the ships’ guns, Prince George landed with 1,200 English and 400 Dutch marines; but the governor of Barcelona, Don Francisco de Velasco, had managed to keep the city's disaffected elements quiet and Philip V's partisans on the alert. Moreover, the dissidents were incensed by the size of the Alliance force and had expected the personal appearance of 'Charles III'. Ultimatums for Velesco to surrender on pain of bombardment were ignored, and the plans for an insurrection from within the city’s walls failed to materialize. Rooke, fearing an attack from a French squadron, was impatient for departure. Prince George could do little more than order his local followers – a thousand in all – to disperse to their homes. The marines embarked on 1 June without loss.
Meanwhile, the comte de Toulouse, one of Louis XIV’s illegitimate sons, was sailing towards the Straits with the fleet from Brest. News from Lisbon of the French manoeuvres reached Rooke on 5 June. Determined to prevent the junction of the Toulon and Brest fleets Rooke decided to risk a battle. However, owing to the foul bottoms of the Anglo-Dutch ships the swifter French fleet escaped Rooke’s pursuit and arrived safely in Toulon; thenceforth, Toulouse became the commander of the enlarged French fleet, now known as the Grand Fleet of France. Rooke could not venture within range of the Toulon forts nor risk attack from a superior force so far away from any port of refuge, he therefore turned back towards the Straits where the arrival of an English squadron under Cloudesley Shovell had put the Allies on a numerical equality with the French.
Rooke met Shovell on 27 June off Lagos. Peter II and ‘Charles III’ sent word from Lisbon that they now wished another attempt to be made on Cádiz. Methuen believed the place to be ungarrisoned and easy to take, but the admirals in the fleet remained sceptical, especially when considering that they were not on this occasion carrying a force comparable to the failed attempt there two years earlier. Cádiz, however, was not the only potential target. As the Alliance fleet lay off Tetuan on the Barbary Coast, a council of war aboard Rooke’s flagship discussed the need to please the two kings and save their own reputations. On 28 July the Alliance commanders considered the proposal of Prince George, now commander-in-chief of Alliance forces in the peninsula, for an attack on Gibraltar.
The idea of attacking Gibraltar was old and widely spread. The ‘Rock’ had caught the attention of Oliver Cromwell, and later William III's and Queen Anne’s ministers had marked it for England. The Moors had previously shown interest in the Rock and fortified it with a castle whose ruins still remained. Emperor Charles V had added many other works; but its immediate operational benefit was negligible. Gibraltar had little trade and its anchorage was unprotected – there was no question, at this time, of basing a fleet there.
Battle.
The Grand Alliance fleet crossed from Tetuan on 30 July; by 1 August Rooke, flying his flag in the Second Rate "Royal Katherine", stood at the entrance to the bay while Admiral George Byng’s squadron (16 English under Byng and six Dutch ships under Rear Admiral Paulus van der Dussen) anchored inside, ranging themselves within the line of defences from the Old to the New Mole. The council of war had decided that Prince George would land with 1,800 English and Dutch marines on the isthmus under cover of a naval bombardment. The marines landed at the head of the bay, and met with no resistance except for a small body of cavalry. They cut off Gibraltar from the mainland while the enemy on the nearby hills were dispersed by fire from two ships sent to the east of the rock.
Prince George summoned the governor, Don Diego de Salinas, to surrender in the name of Charles III. He refused, and the garrison pledged its allegiance to Philip V. Although the governor was determined to resist he knew he did not have the means to do so: his earlier requests for a reinforcements and military stores had always been in vain. By his own account, Don Diego had ‘no more than fifty-six men of whom there were not thirty in service’ and could count on a few hundred civilian militia ‘of such bad quality that before they Allied fleet arrived they began to run away.’ In addition, he had 100 cannon of various kinds but few were in a state to be fired, and fewer still had gunners to fire them.
The 2 August passed in preliminaries. Don Diego, who in Trevelyan’s words was prepared to ‘die like a gentleman’, sent back his defiant reply to the summons to surrender. Byng’s squadron warped themselves in along the sea front as close as the depth permitted and Captain Jumper brought the "Lenox" within actual musket range of the New Mole. These operations were carried out in a dead calm, and were not impeded by a few shots from the Spanish batteries. At midnight Captain Edward Whitaker of the "Dorsetshire" led a party against a French privateer anchored at the Old Mole which had been firing at the marines on the isthmus.
About 05:00 the following day, 3 August, Byng’s squadron of 22 ships fired in earnest on the crumbling walls and forts. Tens of thousands of shells were fired in the attack. The actual damage done was small in proportion to the expenditure of the shot, but in view of the possible approach of the French fleet the job had to be done quickly or not at all. Captain Whitaker acted as Byng’s aide-de-camp, carrying his instructions from ship to ship, including the final order to cease firing six hours after they had begun. As the smoke lifted Captain Jumper at the southern end of the line could discern the New Mole and the fort that commanded its abutment on the land. The defenders of the fort appeared to have fled, and Whitaker and Jumper agreed that a landing could be effected there unopposed. Rooke granted the request to attack, and a flotilla of row-boats raced for the New Mole.
Landing.
As the Grand Alliance prepared for their assault the priests, women, and children who had taken refuge at the chapel of Europa Point at southern end of the peninsula, began to return to their homes in the town. An English ship fired a warning shot in front of the civilian column forcing them back out of harms way, but the shot was mistaken by the rest of the fleet as a signal to resume fire, and the bombardment began again. Under cover of the guns the landing party did its work.
The foremost sailors clambered into the breached and undefended fort at the New Mole; however, by accident or design the magazine at the fort blew up. Some of the landing party carried lighted gun-matches and, according to Trevelyan, had forgotten the possibility of a powder-magazine. Whatever the cause of the explosion the Alliance suffered between 100–200 casualties. A momentary panic ensued, for the survivors suspected an enemy-laid trap had caused the disaster. There was a rush for the boats, but at this critical moment Captain Whitaker arrived with reinforcements. The landing was supported by a number of Catalan volunteers, from who one of Gibraltar's main spots, Catalan Bay, bears its name. Within a few minutes the attackers had rallied and were proceeding north along the deserted ramparts of the seafront towards Gibraltar. On arriving near Charles V's southern wall of the town, Whitaker halted the sailors and hoisted the Union Flag in a bastion on the shore.
Byng now came ashore with several hundred more seamen. Thus was the town invested by Byng in the south, as well as on its stronger northern side where the marines had landed with Prince George. Meanwhile, the party of the women and children stranded at Europa Point had been captured by English sailors. Rooke had given orders that the prisoners were not to be ill-treated, but the desire to recover these women was a further inducement for the defenders to end their resistance. Seeing all was lost Don Diego agreed to terms that guaranteed the lives and property of those committed to his care. Under the capitulation French subjects were taken prisoner, while any Spaniard who would take an oath of allegiance to 'Charles III' as King of Spain could remain in the town with religion and property guaranteed. However, with the exception of a few families the Spanish elected to depart to the mainland, where shortly afterwards they founded the town of San Roque in sight of their ancient home.
Aftermath.
Most of the inhabitants chose to leave Gibraltar because their priests promised them that it would soon be retaken. They were also persuaded by Alliance looting parties. Rooke remembered the looting at Cádiz but could not prevent a repetition at Gibraltar: the treasures at the Europa shrine were seized and all the churches save one were sacked, besides private houses. The Alliance's conduct aroused anger in Spain against the 'heretics', and once again the chance of winning over Andalusians to the Imperial cause was lost. Prince George was the first to complain, which was resented by Byng who had led the fighting and who in turn blamed the Prince and his few Spanish or Catalan supporters. Rooke complained in a letter home that the Spaniards were so exasperated against the Alliance that ‘they use the prisoners they take as barbarously as the Moors’.
The capture of Gibraltar, however, was recognized as a great achievement in Lisbon and by all the trading interests in the Mediterranean. A month after its capture Secretary of State Sir Charles Hedges described it as 'of great use to us English for securing our trade and interrupting the enemy’s'. With the English navy established on the Straits the piratical Moors of the Barbary Coast became reluctant to attack English merchant shipping, and allied themselves with Queen Anne. However, Gibraltar's immediate use as a port was limited for it could only take a few ships at a time, and ministers did not think they could keep it unless a garrison could be found for its security. John Methuen recommended an English garrison. This was supplied by the marines that had helped take the place, and by several companies of regular troops. Gibraltar was, therefore, held by English troops and at English cost – but it was in 'Charles III's' name. A year later the Austrian candidate wrote to Queen Anne about "“Ma ville de Gibraltar”". If he had succeeded in his attempt to ascend the throne in Madrid the difficulty of keeping Gibraltar for England would have been politically very great.
The Alliance fleet returned to Tetuan to water. Before fresh orders came from Lisbon there was news of the approach of the French Grand Fleet under Toulouse. In an attempt by the French to retake Gibraltar, the one full-dress naval engagement of the war was fought off Málaga on 24 August; afterwards, French and Spanish troops battered at the land approaches, defended by a small garrison of sailors, soldiers, and marines. These attempts failed, and with the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 Britain formally gained control of Gibraltar which remains a British overseas territory.

Walter Cradock

Walter Cradock (Craddock, Cradoc) (c. 1606 – 1659) was a Welsh Anglican clergyman, who became a travelling evangelical preacher. He was a founder of the first Independent church in Wales in 1638, at Llanvaches, with William Wroth and William Thomas, an early Baptist.
Life.
He was born at Trefela, near Llangwm, Monmouthshire, and is believed to have been educated at the University of Oxford. His first position was as a curate, at Peterston-super-Ely, Glamorgan.
In 1633 William Erbery, Vicar of St.Mary's, Cardiff, Cradock his curate there, and William Wroth, were reported to William Laud, and the Court of High Commission turned them out for unorthodox preaching, and on the technical grounds and acid test of orthodoxy, of refusing to read the Book of Sports. From late in 1634 Cradock spent almost a year in Wrexham, preaching, and making a convert of Morgan Llwyd. From there Cradock had to move to Herefordshire, where he met Vavasor Powell. With John Miles, Cradock, Erbery, Powell, and Llwyd are the group of recognised Puritan leaders, who founded the later Welsh Nonconformist congregations, whether Baptist, Congregationalist, Presbyterian or Quaker.
He was also at Shrewsbury at this period. Sir Robert Harley, of Brampton Bryan, Herefordshire, took Cradock in, during 1639. He moved on to Llanfair Waterdine, and an independent congregation there. On the outbreak of the English Civil War the Llanvaches congregation, an independent conventicle, moved with Cradock to Bristol, where there was an independent church at Broadmead. Since royalist forces then occupied Bristol, in 1643, some moved again to London, and made contact with Henry Jessey, who had been a supporter of the congregation from the start; Cradock preached with Jessey at All-Hallows-the-Great.
In 1641 Cradock was in the group of preachers for Wales authorized by the Long Parliament : others were Erbery, Ambrose Mostyn, Richard Symonds, and Henry Walter. These Welsh radicals formed a tight and effective lobbying group, and held together until the mid-1650s. Parliament renewed similar authority, in 1645 and 1646, with funding; it was also specified that Symonds, Henry Walter and Cradock should preach in Welsh. Cradock had already shown he could do that in 1645, preaching to captured royalist Welshman after the battle of Naseby.
He was one of the “Welsh saints”, who commanded troops of Thomas Harrison with Vavasor Powell and Jenkin Jones. He was later appointed the regular preacher to Barebone's Parliament, at St. Margaret's, Westminster.
He was a supporter of Oliver Cromwell, and when controversy arose over Cromwell's Protectorate, he condemned Vavasor Powell's anti-Cromwell pamphlet "The Word of God". The majority of the Welsh Puritan group of which he had been a founder agreed with him. He withdrew, to a living at Llangwm.

Dizak

Dizak (), also known as Ktish after its main stronghold, was a medieval Armenian principality in the historical Artsakh and later one of the five melikdoms of Karabakh, which included the southern third of Khachen (present-day Nagorno-Karabakh) and from the 13th century also the canton of Baghk of Syunik. The founder of this principality was Esayi abu-Muse, in the 9th century. In the 16-18th centuries Dizak was ruled by the Armenian Melik-Avanian dynasty, a branch of the House of Syunik-Khachen. The seat of the princes of Dizak was the town of Togh (or Dogh) with the adjacent ancient fortress of Ktish. One of the last princes of Dizak, Esayi Melik-Avanian, was killed by Ibrahim Khalil Khan in 1781, after a long-lasting resistance in the fortress of Ktish.
Today the name "Dizak" is often used to refer to the province Hadrut of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.

Esayi Abu-Muse

Esayi Abu-Muse (, in Arabic sources: "Isa ibn-Istifanus") was an Armenian prince of southern Artsakh, who ruled a major part of Arran (Aghuank) in the mid-9th century and is considered the founder of the House of Dizak.
Name and Origins.
"Abu-Muse" means "father of Muse" (Movses) in Arabic, in Armenian sources he is surnamed "the Priest's son". Arabic sources call him also "Isa ibn-Yusuf" (son of Hovsep) or "Isa ibn-ukht-Istifanus" (nephew of Stepanos), the latter being a reference to his maternal uncle Stepanos-Ablasad, who according to the historian Arakel Babakhanian was a Mihranid and whoes fiefs succeeded to Esayi Abu-Muse after his murder in 831.
According to the same historian Esayi Abu-Muse was a member of the local Armenian House of Aranshahik.
Reign.
Esayi's succession took place in ca. 841 and he remained in power for 13 years. Most of his domains included the cantons of Artsakh, which previously had offered a strong resistance against Babak Khorramdin. Esayi's seat was Ktish (Dogh), another important stronghold was Goroz. The ruins of this castles today lie near the villages Toumi and Togh in the province Hadrut of Nagorno-Karabakh.
The Armenian historiographer Movses Kaghankatvatsi, who described Esayi Abu-Muse as a "man of peace", wrote that he ruled the following cantons:
Resistance at Ktish.
In 854 the Dizak was invided by the Arabian Army in command of Bugha al-Kabir al-Sharabi, who previous to that captured the Princes Atrnerseh of Khachen, Ktrij of Gardman and Kon-Stepanos Sevordiats of Utik. Esayi was besieged in his Castle Ktish but remained victorious in 28 battles. According to the historiographer Tovma Artsruni the Arabian Army had a strength of 200.000 men. He described one of Esayi's heroic resistance against a storming of Bugha. Mushegh Bagratuni (the son of Smbat Sparapet, who was forced to join the Arab Army) recited a poem to this battle, comparing it with the second coming of Christ.
The resistance of Ktish endured more than a year. Esayi wrote to the caliph protesting against this attack and after receiving from him a safe-conduct, he went to Bugha for peace talks. Bugha however treacherously captured him. In 855 Esayi Abu-Muse, along with him all the princes of Armenia, who were captured by Bugha, were exciled to Samarra in Mesopotamia.
Offspring.
Princes Sophy left an Armenian inscription in the "Red Church" of Toumi, which dates back to 1000, presently preserved in the Artsakh State Museum.

Horng fong

The horng fong is a legendary reptilian creature believed by some to be a pygmy ceratopsian still alive in the jungles of the Mekong Delta.
Evidence.
Ivan T. Sanderson and Bernard Huevelmans both collected first hand accounts of the creature which some native villagers described as a "large turtle with a horned shell on its head". 
Very little anecdotal evidence and little to no physical evidence has ever been provided to prove its existence. According to the book Animal Tales - An Anthology of Animal Literature footprints were photographed in the 1930s. Researchers dismissed these as crocodile prints and the photos soon vanished. A few attempts have been made by westerners to track the creature but there have been no sightings outside of the local population with the exception of two French missionaries in 1908 who saw several crossing a river and described them as "comme un paquet de loup, mais fait du porc a classé des crocodiles" (like a wolf pack made up of pig-like crocodiles). With no recent sightings and very little information, the horng fong has as little credibility as other tales of living dinosaurs and is most likely to be just an actual species of turtle, possibly now extinct.

Harry Beadles

George Harold "Harry" Beadles (28 September 1897 – 29 August 1958) was a Welsh professional footballer and Wales international.
Early life.
One of seven children, Beadles was born in Llanllwchaiarn, on the outskirts of Newtown, Powys, to Thomas, a quarryman, and Sarah Ann Beadles. As a child he attended a local board school but was forced to leave at the age of 12 in order to help support his family and he instead took up employment at a local warehouse, owned by Pryce Pryce-Jones, as a furrier. His brother Albert had also previously worked at the warehouse but had been killed after being hit by one of the carts used by the warehouse which was taking part in a parade.
World War I.
On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Beadles, along with two of his older brothers, Ewart and Ernie, enlisted in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, even though he was only 16 years old at the time. While his regiment were stationed in Britain on training exercises, Beadles was a bugle boy but, in 1915, his unit took part in the landing at Suvla Bay where, despite still being under the minimum age, he served on the frontline as a rifleman.
During this time, Beadles performed an action that would later see him awarded the Serbian Gold medal for gallantry. He was awarded the medal after saving the life of a Serbian observer officer, while under heavy artillery fire, who had been wounded in no man's land.
He remained on the frontline until December 1915, when the area was evacuated due to the heavy fighting. Due to the extreme cold, Beadles was suffering from frostbite and was found floating and unconscious in the water at the time of the evacuation and was subsequently sent to a military hospital in Malta. After recovering he was sent to re-join his regiment, who were now stationed in Palestine. He took part in all three attempts to capture Gaza and the eventual push to take Jerusalem under the command of Edmund Allenby. During the second battle of Gaza, his brother Ewart was awarded the Military Medal and promoted to the rank of Sergeant.
After the conclusion of the war, his unit remained in Palestine until mid 1919. It was here that he met former Wales international George Latham and the pair would go on to be lifelong friends.
Football career.
On his return to Wales, Beadles played for his local side Newtown before moving to Merseyside, where he turned out for amateur team Graysons, a local side that represented a local shipping company, whilst working for the company. In June 1921 he signed for Liverpool, along with teammate Danny Shone. He made his debut in September in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea but he was never a regular in the side, making just 18 appearances in all competitions during his three years at the club before moving to Cardiff City in 1924 where George Latham was working on the training staff.
Signed as a replacement for Joe Clennell who had joined Stoke City, Beadles made his debut in a 1-1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. A consistent scorer at the club, including scoring in the quarter-final of the FA Cup against Leicester City, he was part of the side that reached the 1925 FA Cup Final before losing 1-0 to Sheffield United. During his time at the club Beadles won two caps for Wales, playing in consecutive matches on 14 and 28 February 1925 against Scotland and England, before being sold to Sheffield Wednesday in order to raise money.
Beadles never played in the first team at Sheffield Wednesday, only ever making appearances in the reserve team, and was allowed to join Southport in 1926 where he spent three seasons as captain, finishing as the club's top scorer in all three seasons before leaving the club in April 1929 due to a persistent knee injury. He spent a short time as a player-coach at Dundalk but soon retired from football.
Later life.
After returning to Merseyside, Beadles spent a short time as a prison officer at Walton jail whilst also working at a local sports equipment retailer. After leaving the jobs he joined Bents Brewery, who at the time were recruiting former professional footballers to front their business. After managing a number of the company's pubs and hotels, he was handed control of the company's main hotel in Liverpool in 1939. In the late 1940s, his health declined and he was unable to continue running the hotel and, after running a smaller pub, he was forced into early retirement in the 1950s. After a long illness he died on 29 August 1958 at the age of 60.

Director of Operations, Planning and Development for Military Commissions

The Director of Operations, Planning and Development for Military Commissions serves as the point of contact between the Office of Military Commissions and other United States military and civilian agencies. The position was created on 19 September 2008.
Reporting structure.
The position was to be filled by a flag officer, who was to report directly to the Department of Defense's General Counsel, who was at the time William J. Haynes. Haynes has subsequently resigned, and the first Director reported to United States Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England and acting General Counsel Daniel J. Dell'Orto.
Directors.
The first officer to be appointed Director was Brigadier Thomas W. Hartmann a military lawyer in the United States Air Force Reserve. Hartmann had previously been the Legal Advisor to the Convening Authority for the Office of Military Commissions. The Convening Authority is a civilian position, currently held by VADM Bruce MacDonald, the former TJAG of the US Navy (Pentagon). As Legal Advisor Hartmann was essentially the second-in-command.
Hartmann had been reassigned from the position of Legal Advisor after the officers Presiding over three separate Guantanamo military commissions had barred him from participation after he was accused of putting "undue command influence" on Prosecutors. These allegations were later found to be unsubstantiated. On 2 November 2008 Carol Rosenberg, writing in the "Miami Herald", reported that Hartmann had filed a request to retire from the Air Force on 17 February 2008.
Hartmann was replaced by his deputy Michael Chapman, who had been the deputy Legal Advisor since April 2005.
Hartmann attributed his reassigment, and appointment to the new position, to the "explosive growth of the commissions over the last 10 or 12 months."
The Air Force described Hartmann new appointment as a promotion. Hartmann's boss at the Pentagon, William J. Haynes, had resigned in February. 
The Operations Director position was "civilianized" in the fall of 2009 following Hartman's retirement. The current Director of Operations, Ward K. Johnson, III, was appointed to the post in November 2009. Johnson had previously served on active duty with the U.S. Army as a Branch Chief, Presiding Officer and Tribunal President with the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants under the control of Deputy Secretary of Defense England. Johnson had previously served as Director of Operations of the North Dakota National Guard, Provost Marshal for the North Dakota Joint Forces Headquarters, and Commander of the North Dakota Joint Training Center among other senior positions in the North Dakota National Guard. Johnson is a 2005 graduate of the United States Army War College and has been a lawyer licensed to practice law since 1988.

Combined Joint Task Force 7

Combined Joint Task Force 7 was the interim military formation that directed the U.S. effort in Iraq between June 2003 and May 2004. It replaced the Coalition Forces Land Component Command on 14 June 2003. CFLCC was the land forces component of United States Central Command that carried out the initial invasion of Iraq, was established by Commander, U.S. Army Forces Central Command, in 2002/3, to oversee two corps-sized organizations, I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF) and V Corps. These two corps-level formations carried out Operation Iraqi Freedom which began on 20 March 2003.
In a meeting which Commander-in-Chief Central Command, General Tommy Franks held with his officers after the announcement of the Coalition Provisional Authority in late April 2003, it was decided that a new Combined Joint Task Force, headed by a three-star general, would be the best organisation to take over from the CFLCC. General Gene Renuart chose the new force's number, 7, as that was the number his son had worn on his soccer uniform. Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez was selected to lead the new force, drawing on the V Corps staff with senior officer augmentation from across the army.
The United States deployed more than seven-eighths of the soldiers in the occupying coalition with the majority of other troops coming from the United Kingdom and the rest made up from several other allies. Their status as Coalition Provisional Authority, or "Occupying Powers" under a United Nations resolution changed when the new government came to power on June 28, 2004, although they were still heavily influenced by the massive U.S. military and diplomatic presence in the country.
The Task Force was replaced by Multi-National Force - Iraq and Multi-National Corps - Iraq on 15 May 2004.
Rotations 2 and 3.
On 23 July 2003, the Operation Iraqi Freedom 2 (OIF-2) rotation for Combined Joint Task Force 7 was announced. The 3rd Infantry Division was to be replaced by the 82nd Airborne Division (-), the I MEF by what was to become Multinational Division South Center, 4th Infantry Division by 1st Infantry Division, with an Army National Guard Brigade (ARNG) attached, 1st Armored Division by 1st Cavalry Division, also with an ARNG Brigade attached, 3 ACR by 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, and 101st Airborne Division by a putative Multinational Division that in the event was never formed. In the event, the 101st was replaced by Task Force Olympia.
The complete OIF-2 rotation to brigade level under CJTF-7 was as follows (although OIF-1 and OIF-3 units were present at virtually every point during OIF-2):

Rita de Acosta Lydig

Rita Lydig (born Rita Hernandez de Alba de Acosta, October 1875– October 27, 1929) was an American socialite regarded as "the most picturesque woman in America." She was photographed by Adolf de Meyer, Edward Steichen, and Gertrude Käsebier, sculpted in alabaster by Malvina Hoffman, and was painted by Giovanni Boldini and John Singer Sargent, among others. She also wrote one novel, "Tragic Mansions" (Boni & Liveright, 1927), under the name "Mrs Philip Lydig", a society melodrama described as "emotionally moving and appealing" by "The New York Times".
Birth and family.
Rita de Acosta was born in New York City in 1875 to Ricardo de Acosta, a steamship-line executive of Cuban descent, and a Spanish mother, Micaela Hernández de Alba y de Alba, reputedly a relation of the Dukes of Alba. She had seven siblings: Joaquín, Enrique, Ricardo, Mercedes, Aida, Maria, and Ángela.
Her sister Mercedes de Acosta, a lover of movie star Greta Garbo, was an author, a scriptwriter, and social critic. Another sister, Aida de Acosta, became the first female to fly a powered aircraft solo.
Personal life.
Rita de Acosta was married twice:
In 1921 Lydig announced her engagement to Reverend Percy Stickney Grant, rector of the Church of the Ascension. Their wedding plans were broken off in 1924 when Bishop William Manning refused to authorise the marriage, citing Lydig being a divorcée with two living former husbands. Rev. Grant died shortly afterwards, leaving his personal fortune to the woman he had hoped to marry, and Lydig spent large sums of money on fashion, art, furniture, and other objects to overcome her grief. Heavily in debt, she was forced to sell her Washington Square home and its contents, was declared bankrupt, and died of pernicious anaemia at the Gotham Hotel shortly after, at the age of 54.
Lydig is buried with her mother and sister Mercedes at Trinity Church Cemetery in Washington Heights, New York City.
Influence on art and fashion.
Famous for her extravagant lifestyle, '...Rita was equally welcomed in Paris, where she spent parts of each year. She would arrive at the Ritz with a hairdresser, masseuse, chauffeur, secretary, maid... and forty Louis Vuitton trunks... In Paris, she joined ranks with musicians, artists, intellectuals, and philosophers, names like Rodin, Eleonora Duse, Yvette Guilbert etc... Impressed by Rita's innate creative spirit, Isabella Stewart Gardner, the great collector and creator of the Gardner museum in Boston, once asked their mutual friend, John Singer Sargent, why Rita had never expressed herself artistically. "Why should she?" Sargent answered, "She herself is art."
Lydig lived in New York, Paris and London, and counted Edgar Degas, Auguste Rodin, Leo Tolstoy, Sarah Bernhardt, Ethel Barrymore and Claude Debussy among her friends. She also supported the suffragette cause.
Her personal wardrobe became the basis for the start of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

John Frank Davidson

John Frank Davidson FRS, FREng, FIChemE (born 7 February 1926) is a British chemical engineer and former Shell Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Cambridge. He is regarded as the founding father of the Fluidization in Chemical Engineering.
Early life.
John Frank Davidson was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, the industrial centre of the county of Northumberland. His school years (1937–1944) fell on severe days of World War II. In 1944, he entered the University of Cambridge, with which all his further life has been associated. After receiving the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1947, Davidson joined Rolls Royce in Derby, where he served two and a half years in the Mechanical Development Department. Having returned in 1950 to Cambridge, he became a graduate student in the Engineering Department (1950–1952). At the end of 1952, he passed to the recently founded Department of Chemical Engineering of the University of Cambridge. In that period, Davidson began to theoretically study the motion of large gas bubbles in liquids and wrote his still widely cited works on the mass transfer between a bubble and a liquid flowing past it. However, what is more important, these studies stimulated him to carry out a number of pioneering works on fluidization, which were generalized in his book Fluidised Particles(1963), written with David Harrison (later, this book was translated into Russian). This was one of the first books on fluidization, and it generated keen interest.
Career.
Davidson’s works made an important contribution to the development of the hydrodynamics of a circulating fluidized bed and the heat transfer in a fluidized bed and also to the creation and implementation of methods for lignite combustion in a fluidized bed. Davidson received the degree of PhD in 1953 and the degree of Doctor of Science in 1968 at the University of Cambridge. In 1974, for works on two-phase flows and, first of all, for achievements in fluidization, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in chemical engineering (He elected as a Vice President, Royal Society of London, 1989). In 1974–1975, he was a member of the Court of Enquiry for the Flixborough disaster.
Davidson’s research work was always closely related to his pedagogical activities. He started as a university demonstrator in chemical engineering (1950) and then was a university lecturer (1954), a reader in chemical engineering (1964), and a professor (1975). In 1975–1993, Davidson headed the Department of Chemical Engineering of the University of Cambridge and did much for the development of the department, updating of the curriculum, and strengthening of relations with industry. In 1978–1993, he bore the title of Shell Professor of Chemical Engineering since Shell was an important sponsor of the foundation of the department. 
Indissoluble are the ties of Davidson’s life and activities with Trinity College, one of the oldest Cambridge colleges, ties lasting from 1949 to the present time. In 1957, he became the College’s steward responsible for the entire household, including organization of receptions of the royal family. The most difficult challenge in this period was the reconstruction of the Old Kitchen, built in 1605. This reconstruction lasted several years in the early 1960s. In 1992–1996, Davidson was vice master of Trinity College.
In 1970–1971, Davidson was president of the Institution of Chemical Engineers; he is a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Engineering (1976), Docteur Honoris Causa de l’Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse (1979), an Honorary Doctor of Science of the University of Aston (1989), and a Foreign Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy (1991). He has the Kurnakov Memorial Medal given by the Kurnakov Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry of the USSR Academy of Sciences (1991) and was elected a foreign member of the Russian Engineering Academy (1998). In 1999, Davidson was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society of London.
Davidson is a frequent participant at and guest of Mendeleev congresses, at which he has delivered plenary lectures. At the present time, he continues active research work at the Department of Chemical Engineering of Cambridge University since his retirement in 1992.
Personal life.

Aker BioMarine

Aker BioMarine is a Norwegian fishing and biotech company providing krill products through a fully documented and secured catch and process chain. Based in Oslo, Aker BioMarine is part of the Aker Group The company also created ECO-HARVESTING™ or Eco-Harvesting™.
History.
Aker BioMarine was established as an independent enterprise in 2006, building on years of deepwater fishing experience as part of Norway‘s Aker Group. Its previous business activities were, with theexception of the biotechnology company Natural, previously organized under Aker Seafoods Holding, a 100 percent subsidiary of Aker ASA. In 2003, Aker BioMarine began what it is best known for: harvesting and processing Antarctic krill. Traditionally, harvesting krill in a commercially viable and environmentally sound way was difficult. Aker claims it has solved this problem through its proprietary Aker ECO-HARVESTING™ technology.
Technology and Products.
Aker BioMarine produces kill products rich in omega-3s phospholipids. Krill is mainly used for the production of krill meal and krill oil, which in turn is used for animal or aquaculture feed and for human consumption through health products and omega-3 supplements. Krill is mainly used for the production of krill meal and krill oil, which in turn is used for animal or aquaculture feed and krill oil for human consumption through health products and omega-3 supplements. 
The company has registered Superba™ as the company’s brand name for nutraceuticals and Qrill™ as the company’s brand name for its krill meal and krill oil products for aquaculture.
As for research, a 2009 study of Superba™ krill oil found that it gave a substantially larger reduction of fat in the heart and the liver than omega-3 from fish oil. A clinical study in children with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) suggests that Superba™ krill oil offered significant improvements in both clinical scores and in identified EEG patterns as compared to typical ADHD EEG patterns. In one study, krill-fed salmon acquired 11% greater body weight than that of the fish in the control group.
In 2011, Superba™ krill oil earned GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status after an independent panel of recognized experts determined it to be safe for use as a human food ingredient. In one study, krill-fed salmon acquired 11% greater body weight than that of the fish in the control group.
The company uses ECO-HARVESTING™, a unique technology that brings live krill on board the boat. Aker’s ECO-HARVESTING™ technology successfully prevents the unnecessary by-catch such as birds and sea mammals. It also reduces the wastage incurred by traditional methods when a proportion of the catch at the bottom of the net is rendered unusable through pressure from the rest as it is hauled aboard.
The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified ECO-HARVESTING™ as sustainable on June 15, 2010. As of 2013, Aker BioMarine is the only krill fishery to achieve this distinction.
Awards and Accomplishments.
Aside from Superba receiving GRAS status and achieving MSC certification, the company received the "Investment in the Future Award 2012" from "Nutrition Business Journal". Aker BioMarine received the award for "strategically investing more than $550 million to build out the krill supply chain in the Antarctic with a long-term focus on sustainable harvesting".
Memberships and Associations.
Aker BioMarine works closely with WWF-Norway and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) as well as independent scientists and marine conservationists to ensure that the company contributes to the well-being of the krill fishery and the Antarctic food chain. To that end, Aker BioMarine is a founding member of the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies (ARK), which works with CCAMLR to ensure a healthy and sustainable krill population in Antarctica.

Migraine Boy

Migraine Boy is a comic strip created by cartoonist Greg Fiering, which has been published in several mainstream printed media and TV.
Usually presented in black and white six-panel strips, the comic is set in a typical American suburban neighbourhood backyard, and deals with a bad-tempered kid suffering from chronic migraine, and his interaction with his neighbour who constantly approaches him trying to befriend him.
The stories have a grim, sometimes absurd or surreal sense of humor, and often end up with Migraine Boy reacting violently to the irritation produced by his neighbour.
History.
The comic strip made its first appearance in 1992 in the Seattle-based Hype magazine.
Over the course of the years, it was also published in other printed media, such as the Spy magazine, Flagpole Magazine, the Village Voice, UTNE Reader, The Baffler, Rolling Stone, and Entertainment Weekly.
In 1994, the US rock band R.E.M. chose Fiering to create the album cover for their album titled "Monster", after lead singer Michael Stipe saw "Migraine Boy" in the "Flagpole" magazine. This ultimately resulted in "Flagpole" introducing Stipe and Fiering to each other, and "Migraine Boy" being featured in the album's inside booklet.
A year later, in 1995 a 64-page book, called "Migraine Boy's Fairweather Friends" (ISBN , ), was published in the US by St. Martin's Griffin, featuring an introductory text written by Stipe.
In 1996, animation studio GreenHead Media produced a series of twelve thirty-second short clips for MTV, animated by James Dean Conklin, which were aired as fillers over the duration of that year.
Later, in year 2000, a second book, titled "I Don't Love You!: The Best of Migraine Boy" (ISBN , ) was published by Slave Labor Graphics.
In 2001, Fiering and Conklin independently produced an animated short film called "Migraine Boy: The Bet", technically superior to those aired on MTV, which featured colored 3D graphics.
Awards.
The "Migraine Boy" website was nominated for the 1997 Webby Awards, in the "Art and Design" category.
Characters.
Because there is seldom continuity or consistency in Migraine Boy, the strip can have him kill his neighbor in the last panel.

His father, Nasrollah Khan Sepahsalari Kompani Shirazi, was a merchant who spent 6 months out of the year in France and 6 months in Tehran. He would take Persian rugs and artworks to Paris and trade them for French articles. In 1890, Nasrollah Sepahsalari Kompani returned to Iran with 2 pianos and chandeliers. He gave one of the pianos to the Royal Court under Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar. The second piano, he took to his home. At the time, being a wealthy merchant, Nasrollah Sepah Salar Kompani had an estate in Tehran whereby there was a large home towards the aft of the property where his wife and children lived, and near to the entrance of the property, there was a separate building used to entertain guests and finalize business transactions. Apparently, the piano was placed in the business building of the property and no one knew how to play the piano. Nasrollah Khan had 11 children. His 5th child was Habibollah. When he brought the piano, young Habibollah was 4 years of age, and his father would bring him to the entertainment building in the evening and force him to play the piano. He had no formal training in piano playing however, he was accustomed to hearing the traditional Persian instruments such as the Tar, Santoor,and Kamanche. Young Habibollah was able to apply the sounds from these instruments to the piano and produce beautiful music. This became a passion of his which lasted his lifetime. He was often heard on Iranian National Radio playing his piano in the 1950s and was referred to as Goldfingers.
Civil Services.
He became a civil servant and worked with Reza Shah in the modernization of Iran. He was instrumental in the organization of the first Iranian census whereby all citizens of Iran had to be registered and a surname had to be recorded for all families. At the time, he was a Mayor in Shiraz, and therefore, he adopted the name of Shahrdar, which means holder or possessor of the city. His last name was then given to all his brothers and sisters. He also was a chief of police in Tehran prior to being appointed mayor of Shiraz. He also was CEO of national Iranian steel company. This was a company established by German engineers.

World War II.
During World War II Nazi Germany requested Iranian assistance in building a railroad track from Iran to Europe. In the late 1930s with the help of German companies and Reza Shah, the Iranian Steel Corporation was formed. Reza Shah appointed Shahrdar in charge of overseeing the development of the corporation. Even though Iran was a neutral country during World War II, Reza Shah seemed to favor Nazi Germany, which alarmed the Allied Forces. On August 25, 1941 the Allied Forces invaded Iran with Russia invading from the North and the British from the South. Shahrdar feared the Russians would retaliate for his involvement with the Iranian Steel Corporation so he took his family and fled to Shiraz. Shiraz is a southern city and was occupied by the British and the Americans. Eventually hostilities subsided and he returned to Tehran.

He married at an early age. His wife died from illness and he did not remarry until age 39.

When he lived in Shiraz, he had the opportunity to be friend with a noble by the name of Emamgholi Afkham-Ebrahimi that he was the son of Soltan Ali Khan VAZIR AFKHAM a prime minister in Qajar dynasty. One day, Emamgholi showed a picture of one of his daughters to Habibollah Shahrdar. Habibollah khan was able to obtain the picture from him and then he sent a message to his sister in Tehran to propose to young Farough Afkhami. Her family and her accepted and in Tehran, Habibollah Shahrdar's sister acted as proxy for civil marriage to her. Therefore he was not present at his wedding. Then a caraven was arranged where both families travelled to Shiraz for the wedding party and at which time Habibollah Shahrdar met his wife Farough. They had 5 children: Cyrus, Farideh, Shahrdokht, Cambize, and Pirooz.

Amboy, Lansing and Traverse Bay Railroad

The Amboy, Lansing and Traverse Bay Railroad is a defunct railroad which operated in the state of Michigan during the 1850s and 1860s. Initially planned as an ambitious land grant railroad which would run the length of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, poor finances and politically motivated routes frustrated these aims.
History.
The AL&TB was one of several railroads chartered in the 1850s to take advantage of a land grant program instituted by the federal government. Under an act of 1856 and successive acts Michigan had in its gift over of land which could be given to railroads (which would then re-sell these lands for a profit) in exchange for constructing certain routes. At the heart of Michigan's network at the time were the Michigan Central Railroad and the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, both of which ran east-west across the southern Lower Peninsula. As proposed in the route would run from "Amboy by Hillsdale and Lansing, and from Grand Rapids to some point on or near Traverse Bay." This route would bisect the existing railroad network and provide a railroad connection to Lansing, the new state capital.
Almost immediately local interests intervened: the cities of Owosso and Saginaw, which sit northeast of Lansing, successfully lobbied to change the route to run through their cities, then northwest to Traverse Bay. This was a pronounced change from the initial plan, in which the line ran in a straight line northwest from Lansing. The new route's odd shape prompted a Lansing newspaper to dub it the "Ram's Horn Railroad." That epithet had been applied earlier in the decade by Iowa newspaperman James Morgan to a proposed road from Dubuque to Keokuk, whose route was also determined by political considerations and ultimately was not built.
The company began by building a line from Lansing to Owosso, which it completed in November 1862.

The Leghs of Lyme are a family who owned Lyme Park in Cheshire, England, from 1398 to 1946, when the house and estate were given to the National Trust. In the early days of the family there were variations of both the surname, and the usually given forename. Variations of the surname include de Legh, a Lee, Leghe and Leyghe, and the given name as Piers, Peers, and Peter. In 1397 the first Sir Piers Legh was granted the family coat of arms by Richard II.
In order to distinguish between the earlier generations, the convention of adding a Roman numeral to the name was often used. In this case the numbering system used in the National Trust Handbook for Lyme Park has been followed.

Gunasthana

Fourteen stages of development.
Through these fourteen stages of development, the soul gradually frees itself, firstly from the worst, then from the less bad and finally from all kinds of karma, and manifests the innate qualities of knowledge, belief and conduct in a more and more perfect form. Following are the stages of spiritual development:
The first four "gunasthana" are related to belief or rationality in perception. As and when the soul acquires rationality in perception it moves on to 4th "gunasthana". Stages 5 to 14 relate to conduct. The purity in conduct determines the gunasthana from 5th stage onwards. Those who have taken the "anuvratas" {minor vows} may reach up to the 5th Gunasthana. The 6th to 14th Gunasthanas can only be attained by those who have taken the "Mahavratas" (major vows) of Jain ascetic.
The destruction of causes of bondage.
The whole scheme of gunasthana in Jain philosophy is devised in a logical order according to the principle of decreasing sinfulness and increasing purity. At the first stage, all the five causes of bondage — Irrational beliefs ("mithyatva"), non-restraint ("avirati"), carelessness ("pramada"), passions ("kashaya") and activities of mind, speech and body ("yoga") — are in full operation. Irrational beliefs ("mithyatva") are partially suppressed in the second and third stages, and are fully eliminated in the fourth stage. In stages five and six, non-restraint ("avirati") is gradually eliminated in stages. From the seventh stage onwards, carelessness is removed and only passions and activity exercise their influence. From the eleventh to the thirteenth all the passions are eliminated and only activity is present. On the last stage, there is no activity, hence no binding of karma.
The destruction of karmas.
Out of the four ghatiya karmas, darsana mohiniya karma (perception deluding karma) is destroyed first in the fourth stage of "gunasthana". Caritra mohiniya karma (conduct deluding karma) is destroyed next in the twelfth gunasthana. The remaining three ghatiya karmas (knowledge obstructing karma, perception obstrcuting karma and energy obstructing karma) are destroyed in the 13th stage and the rest four aghatiya karmas (life-span determining, body determining, status determining and feeling producing karmas) are destroyed in the 14th or the last stage of gunasthana.

These United States

These United States is an American rock band from Brooklyn, New York, and Carrboro, North Carolina, made up of songwriter and bandleader Jesse Elliott, pedal steel and electric guitarist J. Tom Hnatow, guitarist and keyboardist Justin Craig, bassist and vocalist Anna Morsett, and drummer and percussionist Aaron Latos. The band has released 5 full-length albums since 2008 via Colorado-based record label United Interests. In the five years since their formation, TUS has played 800 shows across the United States, United Kingdom, and northern Europe, appearing at South by Southwest, CMJ Music Marathon, and Lollapalooza in the U.S., and the UK's Glastonbury Festival.
History.
TUS' debut album, "A Picture of the Three of Us at the Gate to the Garden of Eden", was recorded by Elliott and producer David Strackany (known to the music world as Paleo) in Elgin, IL, Iowa City, IA, and Washington, D.C.. The album features musical cameos by a large supporting cast—notably, Saadat Awan, Dan D'Avella, Dave Hahn, and early TUS collaborator Mark Charles, now of Vandaveer. "Picture" was mixed and mastered by Chad Clark of Beauty Pill and T.J. Lipple of Aloha at Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, VA, and released on March 4, 2008. Track 'First Sight' had its UK debut on BBC Radio 6 on July 14, 2008, and the album as a whole enjoyed favorable reviews from The Austin Chronicle, Alternative Press, The Village Voice, and others.
"Crimes", the group's second album, was recorded in Lexington, KY at Shangri-La Studios, 6 weeks after the release of "Picture". It was produced and mixed by Duane Lundy, with co-production by Rob Gordon and These United States (by then composed of Elliott and full-time band members Charles, Cosenza, Craig, and Hnatow), and released on September 23, 2008. Paste Magazine, Pitchfork Media, National Public Radio, and others praised the album despite (and in many cases because of) its sonic departure from the group's debut. These United States recorded live sessions and interviews for All Things Considered, Daytrotter, and WOXY.com, as "Crimes" reached No. 30 on the College Music Journal Top 200 radio chart in late 2008.
In February 2009, TUS recorded its third album, "Everything Touches Everything", at Inner Ear Studios, with T.J. Lipple this time taking on the role of producer. Released September 1 of that year, the album proved TUS' most energetic and upbeat to date. SPIN Magazine sang its praises ('captures the overwhelming jolt of simply being alive...swings between a sleazy leer and a dreamy purr...deftly blurring the line between carnal and cosmic'), as Jon Pareles of The New York Times weighed in on the band's live show ('superb...equally at home with quiet, morose tales and galloping punky-tonk adventures...a rambunctious alt-country band with story-songs that are both tangled and aphoristic'). Influential DJ and music writer Bruce Warren, of public radio station WXPN, called These United States 'one of indie-rock's -- no, make that American rock's -- best kept secrets.'
For its fourth full-length album, TUS worked at Sound Mine Recording in rural eastern Pennsylvania. The resulting 10 tracks, produced by Dan Wise and TUS' Justin Craig, and featuring vocals by Dawn Landes, were released on July 20, 2010, as "What Lasts". The accompanying album tour included supporting dates with Fruit Bats, Deer Tick, Langhorne Slim, and Bonnie Prince Billy, and continuing acclaim from The New York Times, Pop Matters, and The Washington Post. Among its 180 live performances of the year were stops at Seattle's KEXP; Daytrotter's Barn On the 4th with The Walkmen, Dawes, and Justin Townes Earle; La Blogotheque's Take-Away Show; and NPR's World Cafe and Mountain Stage.
2011 saw These United States scale back its frenetic touring pace to just 100 shows and festivals, as the band spent more time writing and recording in studios in Kentucky, New York, North Carolina, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Ontario. In 2012, the group will release its 5th full-length album—the eponymously titled "These United States"—featuring contributions from Deer Tick, Phosphorescent, Langhorne Slim, Frontier Ruckus, The Mynabirds, Cotton Jones, Revival, Ben Sollee, Backwords, and Jukebox the Ghost, and co-produced at Shangri-La Studios by Duane Lundy, Justin Craig, and Jesse Elliott.

West Riverdale Historic District

The West Riverdale Historic District is a national historic district located at Riverdale Park, Prince George's County, Maryland, a railroad suburb located northeast of Washington, D.C. The neighborhood was appended to the town of Riverdale Park soon after it was laid out and platted in 1906, and later enlarged in 1937. The district is defined by a modest variety of architectural styles and building types ranging from early-20th century vernacular interpretations of popular styles to diluted, suburbanized examples of revival styles that dominated the second quarter of the 20th century. These styles represent modest examples of Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, Craftsman, and Tudor Revival forms. At the center of the community is the former Eugene Leland Memorial Hospital, now known as the Crescent Cities Health and Rehabilitation Center.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

Nyah Man Chant

Nyah Man Chant is the debut album from Jamaican roots reggae singer Bushman. It was released in 1997 by Greensleeves Records in the United Kingdom and by VP Records in the United States. Bushman had hitch-hiked seventy miles to Kingston in the hope of furthering his career. After meeting renowned production team Steely & Clevie in the car park of the "Arrows" dub-cutting studio, where they were playing football, he auditioned on the spot and was invited to their studio. Prior to the album, Bushman recorded a string of singles for the duo, including "Grow Your Natty", "Call the Hearse", "Remember the Days", "Black Star Liner", and "Man a Lion", all of which were included on the album. The whole album was produced by Steely & Clevie, and employed a real horn section in contrast to many reggae albums of the time, and met with a positive critical reaction. The album recreated the sound of 1970s and 1980s reggae, and included musicians such as Earl "Chinna" Smith, Dean Fraser, and Vin Gordon. The album was described in the Rough Guides book "Reggae: 100 Essential CDs" as "a coherent, excellently crafted set" and "as good an example of modern roots singing as you could hope to find". "Allmusic" called the album "a classic".

Libtorrent

libtorrent is an open source implementation of the BitTorrent protocol. It is written in and has its main library interface in C++. Its most notable features are support for Mainline DHT, IPv6, HTTP seeds and µTorrent's peer exchange.
libtorrent uses Boost, specifically Boost.Asio to gain its platform independence. It is known to build on at least Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD. In many package managers this library is known as libtorrent-rasterbar or the older rb-libtorrent.
Its original author is Arvid Norberg.
Overview.
libtorrent is kept up to date with the most useful bittorrent extensions and is constantly being optimized to work in a broader set of environments. Many of its features can be disabled at compile time to not include code that would not be used in a particular use case. It aims to be the most suitable libtorrent implementation for embedded devices as well as desktops and seed-servers. Some of its implementation details are described in the features section.
libtorrent was the first client to support the extension protocol together with µTorrent, which is now a foundation that many other extensions build upon.
Features.
Disk caching.
All disk I/O in libtorrent is done asynchronously to the network thread, by the disk io thread. When a block is read, the disk io thread reads all subsequent blocks from that piece into the read cache, assuming that the peer requesting the block will also request more blocks from the same piece. This decreases the number of syscalls for reading data. It also decreases delay from seeking.
Similarly, for write requests, blocks are cached and flushed to disk once one full piece is complete or the piece is the least recently updated one when more cache space is needed. The cache dynamically allocates space between the write and read cache. The write cache is strictly prioritized over the read cache.
The cache blocks that are in use, are locked into physical memory to avoid it being paged out to disk. Allowing the disk cache to be paged out to disk means that it would become extremely inefficient to flush it, since it would have to be read back into physical memory only to be flushed back out to disk again.
In order to conserve memory, and system calls, iovec file operations are used to flush multiple cache blocks in a single call.
On low-memory systems, the disk cache can be disabled altogether or set to smaller limit, to save memory.
Network buffers.
On CPUs with small L2 caches, copying memory can be expensive operations. It is important to keep copying to a minimum on such machines. This mostly applies to embedded systems.
In order to minimize the number of times received data is copied, the receive buffer for payload data is received directly into a page aligned disk buffer. If the connection is encrypted, the buffer is decrypted in-place. The buffer is then moved into the disk cache without being copied. Once all the blocks for a piece have been received, or the cache needs to be flushed, all the blocks are passed directly to writev() to flush them in a single syscall. This means a single copy into user space memory, and a single copy back into kernel memory.
When seeding and uploading in general, unnecessary copying is avoided by caching blocks in aligned buffers, that are copied once into the peer's send buffer. The peer's send buffer is not guaranteed to be aligned, even though it is most of the time. The send buffer is then encrypted with the peer specific key and chained onto the iovec for sending.
This means there is one user space copy in order to allow unaligned peer requests and peer-specific encryption.
Piece picker.
The piece picker is a central component in a bittorrent implementation. The piece picker in libtorrent is optimized for quickly finding the rarest pieces. It keeps a list of all available pieces sorted by rarity, and pieces with the same rarity, shuffled. The rarest first mode is the dominant piece picker mode. Other modes are supported as well, and used by peers in specific situations.
The piece picker allows to combine the availability of a piece with a priority. Together they determine the sort order of the piece list. Pieces with priority 0 will never be picked, which is used for the selective download feature.
In order to have as few partially finished pieces as possible, peers have an affinity towards picking blocks from the same pieces as other peers in the same speed category.
The speed category is a coarse categorization of peers based on their download rate. This makes slow peers pick blocks from the same piece, and fast peers pick from the same piece, and hence decreasing the likelihood of slow peers blocking the completion of pieces.
The piece picker can also be set to download pieces in sequential order.
Merkle hash tree torrents.
This is BEP30 of the BitTorrent protocol. Merkle hash tree torrents is an extension that lets a torrent file only contain the root hash of the hash tree forming the piece hashes. The main benefit of this feature is that regardless of how many pieces there are in a torrent, the .torrent file will always be the same size. It will only grow with the number of files (since it still has to contain the file names).
With regular torrents, clients have to request multiple blocks for pieces, typically from different peers, before the data can be verified against the piece hash. The larger the pieces are, the longer it will take to download a complete piece and verify it. Before the piece is verified, it cannot be shared with the swarm, which means the larger piece sizes, the slower turnaround data has when it is downloaded by peers.
Since on average the data has to sit around, waiting, in client buffers before it has been verified and can be uploaded again.
Another problem with large piece sizes is that it is harder for a client to pinpoint the malicious or buggy peer when a piece fails, and it will take longer to re-download it and take more tries before the piece succeeds the larger the pieces are.
The piece size in regular torrents is a tradeoff between the size of the .torrent file itself and the piece size. Often, for files that are 4 GB, the piece size is 2 or 4 MB, just to avoid making the .torrent file too big.
Merkle torrents solves these problems by removing the tradeoff between .torrent size and piece size. With merkle torrents, the piece size can be the minimum block size (16 kB), which lets peers verify every block of data received from peers, immediately. This gives a minimum turnaround time and completely removes the problem of identifying malicious peers.

William Foster Apthorp

William Foster Apthorp (October 24, 1848 in BostonFebruary 19, 1913 in Vevey, Switzerland) was a United States writer, drama and music critic, editor and musician.
Biography.
He was born in 1848. He was the "son of Robert East Apthorp and Eliza Hunt, grandson of John T. Apthorp and direct descendant of Charles Apthorp, named after his maternal great grandfather William Foster. Since before the American Revolution, Apthorp's ancestors had participated in the mercantile and intellectual life of Boston." (Saloman, Am. Nat. Biog., Vol. 13, p. 567) He graduated from Harvard in 1869 having taken musical classes with J. K. Paine. He then took piano from B. J. Lang for 7 or 8 years longer. "Coming from an old Boston family whose efforts in the cause of art have always been most intimately linked with its progress in the city, he has won a career not less worthy than any of his line." (Elson, Supplement, p. 3) 
In 1856, his parents took him to study languages and art in France, Dresden (Marquardt'sche Schule), Berlin (Friedrich Wilhelm'sches Progymnasium), Rome (École des Frères Chrétiens), and Florence (with classmate John Singer Sargent). He developed into an accomplished linguist who could speak “all the leading languages of Europe.” He returned to Boston in 1860. In 1869, he graduated from Harvard College, where he studied piano, harmony, and counterpoint with the institution’s first professor of music, the composer John Knowles Paine. When Paine left for Europe in 1867, he took up the study of piano with B. J. Lang. He studied music theory on his own.
In 1872, he began his career as a critic writing for the "Atlantic Monthly", "Dwight's Journal of Music", the "Boston Courier", and the "Boston Evening Traveller", and went on to help shape Boston’s musical tastes for 20 years as drama and music critic for one of Boston’s premier urban newspapers, the "Boston Evening Transcript". From 1892 to 1901, he was program essayist for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Apthorp also served at various times on the faculties of the National College of Music in Boston (harmony), the New England Conservatory of Music (piano, harmony, counterpoint, and theory), and the College of Music of Boston University (aesthetics and music history). He lectured at the Lowell Institute, Boston, and the Peabody Institute, Baltimore.
He married Octavie Loir Iasigi in 1876. In 1903, failing eyesight prompted his retirement to Vevey, Switzerland.
Books.
His books include:
He also published editions of the songs of Robert Franz and Adolf Jensen, and co-edited, with John D. Champlin, Scribner’s "Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians" (1888–1890).

Kevin Anderson (boxer)

Kevin Anderson is a Scottish professional boxer who fights in the welterweight division. He is a former British and Commonwealth champion.
Early professional career.
Anderson's first fight as a professional took place during April 2003 at the York Hall in Bethnal Green winning his fight in the second round against Paul Mcllwaine. An explosive beginning to his pro career saw him stop each of his next three opponents before going the distance for the first time against Sergey Starkov the tough Russian journeyman. One more points win that year against Frenchman Alban Mothie saw Anderson finish his debut year with an impressive record of 6-0. The fight against Mothie was also notable for the fact that it was the first time Anderson had fought in his native Scotland as a professional boxer. All his previous fights that year having been south of the border.
A further six fights and six wins were had during 2004 taking the young prospects record up to 12-0 by the end of that year. The reward for this came in January 2005 when Anderson would fight for the Celtic welterweight title in Glasgow, taking on and beating Northern Ireland's Glenn McClarnon who had just challenged David Barnes for the full British title in his previous fight. The bout ended in the 4th round when a clash of heads caused a cut above McClarnon's eye and forced the stoppage handing victory and a first career title to Anderson.
British & Commonwealth champion.
The new Celtic champion fought once more that year before meeting reigning champion Joshua Okine for the Commonwealth welterweight crown at the Ice Rink in Kirkcaldy, Anderson's home town. The fight was Anderson's toughest test to date with the Scot scoring a split decision win over the man from Ghana who had just beaten British champion Barnes in his previous fight. In March 2006 Anderson defended his newly won title with a victory over fellow Scot Craig Dickson. In June 2006, Anderson travelled south to the Aston Villa Leisure Centre in order to meet British title holder Young Mutley in a unification clash and according to some reports produced one of the comebacks of the year in order to take both belts home. Anderson had been put down in the 2nd round and suffered a nasty cut in the 4th and both fighters were taking some heavy punches before a left hook from Anderson left Mutley reeling in the 10th round. A punch that eventually led to the referee stopping the fight. The man from Kirkcaldy was the new unified British and Commonwealth title holder. One more non title fight that year saw Anderson finish 2006 with two belts and an unbeaten record of 18-0.
Defeat to Nuumbembe.
Former soldier Ali Nuumbembe was the first man to defeat the Scot in a professional ring. The man from Namibia challenged for the Commonwealth title in February 2007 and ran out a close split decision winner in a fight which took place in Anderson's backyard, the Ice Rink in Kirkcaldy. Despite still have the consolation of holding the British belt Anderson was left fuming by the scoring of the fight made by one of the judges saying ""It was ridiculous. It was like fighting in Italy...I thought I won six out of the first seven and was a round ahead by the time we went into the 12th round...I thought I nicked that round so I couldn't believe that scorecard. But I will come back, I have plenty of time on my side."" He was however himself considered fortunate by some to get through the 8th after a cut above his left eye left Anderson struggling to get through the round.
British champion.
Anderson's next fight saw him defend his British title against Irishman and former WBU champion Eamonn Magee with Anderson claiming that the fight was a great improvement on his last saying ""It was a great win. The key was just getting my head right...I was on my toes for the whole 12 rounds. It's a great achievement."" In September 2007 he followed the win up with another defence against England's Francis Jones in a fight that proved to be a lot tougher than might have first been thought. Anderson had Jones down in the 10th round before the referee stepped in to stop the fight in the 12th. Speaking after what was now his second defence of his title Anderson said ""I was giving him some of my best shots but, to be fair to him, he kept taking them and coming back for more...I thought as the fight went into the later stages that his corner might have pulled him out but he kept coming back for more and more, so all credit to the lad. He gave it everything.""
Fights with Kevin McIntyre.
Fellow Scot Kevin McIntyre stunned the British boxing in November 2007 when in what was to be Kevin Anderson's third defence of the title he found himself thoroughly outboxed and put down a number of times by the challenger. McIntyre himself had suffered a number of defeats in his boxing career and was thought to have found his level before winning a unanimous eventual decision to claim the title. An immediate rematch clause was applied and the two boxers found themselves facing each other once again in February 2008. The fight ended in another win for a delighted McIntyre who said after claiming another points win "I needed to prove the last fight wasn't a fluke...Anderson showed that he might have been under par in the first fight but he wasn't tonight, he showed that he was a tough fighter"
The back to back defeats to McIntyre left Anderson needing to refocus and saw the former champion take some time off from the sport. Speaking to Boxing News about his break from the ring he said ""I needed some time away, to spend with my two kids, to get my head right and around the McIntyre fights. I moved house, had a kid, moved house again, had another kid. I needed the break""

Francis Oliva

Francisco Javier Oliva commonly known as Francis Oliva or Paco Oliva (b. Gibraltar, 1962) is a Gibraltarian journalist and published author. He is the news editor of the "Gibraltar Chronicle", where he also regularly writes opinion articles on current affairs. He is also known as "Paco" or "Francis".
Literary work.
Francisco has published two books to date "The Frontiers of Doubt" which is an in depth critical anaylisis of the Gibraltar question and the relationship between Gibraltar, the United Kingdom and Spain from a non-nationalist perspective. He has also published his first work of fiction "The Night Gibraltar Disappeared and Other Stories", subtitled "("A fictional journey through the void")", his first incursion in the field of modern fiction. 
The book is a collection of short stories some based on nostalgic recollections of the author's youth, while others explore the darker recesses of the human mind, delving into a sombre universe of introspection where themes like isolation, fear, obsession and the destructive nature of all human relationships, come to the fore. 
All the short stories take place in Gibraltar, in its streets, bars, workplaces, urban landscapes and open spaces. As suggested by the book title, even the inner monologues are intimately associated and come to life against and within the dramatic presence of The Rock's jagged topography. 
The book contains a tribute to his beloved film director Luis Buñuel called ""Exterminating Parliament - homenaje a Luis Buñuel"", which combines the infamous 23-F foiled coup d'etat in Spain, with the film ""El ángel exterminador"" Buñuel's legendary tour de force, in the unlikely setting of Gibraltar's Parliament.
Both books were published by Editorial Acenta 2000. 
Currently working on other projects, including a Science fiction novel, he has recently (May 2012) published a new Poetry book 'Imaginary Death of a European Poet' and 'Poemario Gris Dorado 2009-2012' http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=25032. His latest literary work has been described as very intense and powerful by award winning Gibraltar Artist Karl Ullger, who expressed his satisfaction at being able to work with 'that talent and with that type of literature.'

She holds several national records for the younger year classes.
In the first ever Junior World Cup speedskating event organised by the International Skating Union, in Inzell, 28–30 November 2008, Bøkko won the 1500-m and became number three in the 500-m and 1000-m. At the second Junior World Cup, organised one week later in Asker, Bøkko won the 1000-m and came second in the 500-m.

Wurundjeri Tribe Land and Compensation Cultural Heritage Council

The Wurundjeri Tribe Land and Compensation Cultural Heritage Council was established in 1985 by descendants of the Wurundjeri people who are the traditional owners of the country around Melbourne. There are three family groups in the council: the Nevins, Terricks and Wandins with 30 elders and about 60 members.
The members of the Council are all descendants of a Woiwurrung / Wurundjeri man named Bebejan, through his daughter Annie
Borate (Boorat), and in turn, her son Robert Wandin (Wandoon). Bebejan was a Ngurungaeta of the Wurundjeri people and was present at John Batman’s ‘treaty’ signing in 1835.
Roles.
The Wurundjeri Land Council has a number of different roles:
The Victorian Government has granted land of cultural significance for the Land Council to manage. These sites include:
The Council had a statutory role under Commonwealth legislation that gave it the power to grant or refuse consent to disturb Aboriginal sites. This gave the Council members a significant say in how their important cultural places were managed.The Victorian state government introduced the Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006 and the Wurundjeri Council is now approved as a Registered Aboriginal Party under that Act, which will allow the Council to continue to make decisions about its cultural places. However the decision recognised only the area not under dispute with other parties. The other parties include the Wathaurung/ Wathaurong people to the west, the Dja Dja Wurrung/ Jaara Jaara people to the north-west, the Taungurung people to the north, the Gunai/Kurnai people to the east and the Boon Wurrung/ Bunurong people to the south. The dispute over territorial boundaries has been under challenge since they were set down in 1984 legislation.
Administration.
In 2003 questions were raised over claims of missing funds. Wurundjeri Land Council revenue is predominantly from rental of buildings on the 38-hectare former Army School of Health site in Healesville and a $550 a day fee paid by developers for cultural "site monitoring" by the association to obtain approval for work on culturally sensitive areas.
In 2007 the Land Council opened an office at the refurbished Abbotsford Convent to engage with members of the wider community and provide community space for members. The site is on the Yarra River Dreaming Trail, an important part of the bigger creation story of the Wurundjeri people and their country. There are important Wurundjeri camping sites located nearby which have been used for thousands of years. A little way north is the confluence of the Merri Creek and Yarra River near Dights Falls; the burial site of Billibellary; the location of the Aboriginal Protectorate, Native Police Corps headquarters and Merri Creek Aboriginal School.

Stef Carse

Steph Carse, formerly credited as Stef Carse on his French albums, is a Canadian pop singer.
Career.
Carse began his career in the nineties as a young pop star in Quebec, with his earliest hits being French translations of 1990s country hits such as "Achy Breaky Heart" and "Boot Scootin' Boogie". He has sold over 500,000 records earning him a Juno nomination for Best Male Artist at the Juno Awards of 1994.
In 1999, he successfully entered the mainstream Canadian market when he donated a song for the Special Olympics on an album entitled "Holiday Heroes". Featuring artists like Alan Jackson, Donna Summer, Brooks & Dunn and Kevin Bacon, Carse's song led off the album, which went gold and raised over $2 millions of net profit for the Canadian Special Olympics.
Carse released his first American album, "Reach Out", in 2006. "Reach Out" was also promoted by a 60-minute concert special which aired internationally, including on PBS in the United States.
The one-hour special "Reach Out" was filmed in Kauai, Las Vegas, the Bahamas and Orlando, Florida, and has won five awards from The Florida Motion Picture and Television Association FMPTA: "Best Feature Film in a Television Program", "Best Male Vocalist in a Feature Film", "Best Director in a Music Video", "Best Male Vocalist in a Music Video" and "Best Composer for the song Reach Out". Carse's collaborators on the "Reach Out" project were Eric Schilling, Joe Hogue and Gilles Godard.
Carse donated the self-penned title track, "Reach Out" to the American Red Cross in September, just three days before the Hurricane Katrina disaster. The Red Cross fell in love with the song, named it the Official Thank You Song of the American Red Cross and used it to thank volunteers and donors.
The album "The Best Pop Opera 2010", which features Carse's original song "No More Masquerade", reached #1 in Turkey in March 2010, and remained in the Top 5 for over eight months.
In 2012, Carse donated a song to Whole Foods for The Whole Planet Foundation to help fight poverty around the world.

Jugend musiziert

Jugend musiziert is a music competition for children and adolescents in Germany on regional, federal and national level.
"Jugend musiziert" in Germany.
In Germany, the nationwide competition refers to young adults up to 20 years and for the category singing up to 27 years. It serves both the promotion of amateur music and the promotion of young people with professional musical ambitions. The participants should therefore not be in a musical training (full-time) or professional practice. Many well-known musicians performed there as prize-winners the first time to a wider audience. Moreover, success at the competition often is a benchmark for the quality of schools and music lessons. The number of participants in the regional competition from an institution is a clear indication of their commitment and the associated motivation.
The competition is divided into three stages: First stage is at regional level, second is at federal state level for those who passed the first stage. Those passing federal state level will compete at national level. The instrument categories change from solo participation to ensemble each year. In 1993, singing was added to the originally purely instrumental competition. Currently, the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein and Berlin have a pilot phase for the Pop Music category with the instruments guitar pop, pop-bass, drums and pop singing. North Rhine-Westphalia has also added the category DJ.
The participants play music from different epochs. The length of the presentation depends on age and lasts from 6 to 20 minutes.
In 2005, "Jugend musiziert" had nationwide over 20,000 participants in 148 domestic regional competitions and 30 German schools abroad. About 6,500 of them were forwarded to the federal state competitions and nearly 2,000 first prize-winners attended the national competition. The regional competitions usually take place in the first months of a year.
The competition was founded in 1963 under the sponsorship of Deutscher Musikrat (German Music Board) and the patronage of the President of Germany.

ANSI/ASME Y14.1

In 1995, the American National Standards Institute adopted ANSI/ASME Y14.1 which defined a regular series of paper sizes based upon the "de facto" standard 8½ in × 11 in "letter" size which it assigned "ANSI A". This series also includes "ledger"/"tabloid" as "ANSI B". This series is somewhat similar to the ISO 216 standard in that cutting a sheet in half would produce two sheets of the next smaller size. Unlike the ISO standard, however, the arbitrary aspect ratio forces this series to have two alternating aspect ratios. The ANSI series is shown below.
With care, documents can be prepared so that the text and images fit on either ANSI or their equivalent ISO sheets at 1:1 reproduction scale.
Other, larger sizes continuing the alphabetic series illustrated above exist, but they are not part of the series "per se", because they do not exhibit the same aspect ratios. For example, Engineering F size (28 in × 40 in, 711.2 mm × 1016.0 mm) also exists, but is rarely encountered, as are G, H, … N size drawings. G size is 22½ in (571.5 mm) high, but variable width up to 90 in (2286 mm) in increments of 8½ in, i.e., roll format. H and larger letter sizes are also roll formats. Such sheets were at one time used for full-scale layouts of aircraft parts, wiring harnesses and the like, but today are generally not needed, due to widespread use of computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM).

Production.
Development.
During a scriptwriting workshop held by Mira Nair, Cajetan Boy, a young, Kenyan writer from Nairobi, showed Vishal Bhardwaj a script about twin brothers from the city's slums and the events that occur in their lives during a 24 hour period. Bhardwaj liked Boy's approach to the script; Nair and Bhardwaj discussed it and thought it was a typical Bollywood masala movie. Boy sent Bhardwaj another draft of his script. Three years later, Bhardwaj asked Boy to sell him the idea, and he later bought the script for US$4,000. Bharadwaj revisited the idea and added some Bollywood elements and a dark, serious side to the script. He worked on the original idea with writers Sabrina Dhawan, Abhishek Chaubey and Supratik Sen. He included Dhawan in writing the screenplay because as he thought Dhawan could give it a solid structure. Bhardwaj said that during the writing of the screenplay, most of the original ideas were changed and the climax was Indianized. His re-worked version now included one brother with a stammer and the other with a lisp. Bhardwaj said that despite the complicated structure, Kaminey is not arty and could not alienate audiences in any part of India, and that it is a simple story with a complicated structure. Dhawan said that the film's script was complex and has multiple stories which required a lot of writing and rewriting to make each character sound distinct.
The media showed concern over the film's title, terming it "odd", and some people were shocked because of the title, which can be translated into English as "mean". However, the makers said that "kaminey" is not a negative term and is actually a term of endearment. According to Bhardwaj, the idea for the title came from a scene from Gulzar's film "Ijaazat", in which the lead actor (Naseeruddin Shah) refers to the actress in a loving manner; it was the first time that he heard the word used that way. Bhardwaj told Rediff, "when the script of this film was written, it was like discovering your own mean side. The format of the film is of a caper and all the characters in this film, excluding one, has an agenda. So I thought it was an apt title for the film".
Casting.
Shahid Kapoor was cast in the film's lead role. Several media outlets reported that Bhardwaj considered many actors before casting Kapoor in the role, which he turned down. Bhardwaj refuted the claims, saying, "There is a huge difference between discussing and narrating and offering someone a film and I would like to clear up the rumour by saying that Kaminey was never offered to anyone else and so no one rejected it." Kapoor said that he accepted the role after reading the script. Priyanka Chopra was cast to play Sweety, the lead female role. She initially turned down the role, saying she felt it was a boys’ film and her eight-scene part did not seem good enough. However, Bhardwaj persuaded her to accept the role. The idea for casting the screenwriter Amol Gupte came from the casting director Honey Terhan. Gupte said that when he received a call from Terham, he thought it was a joke. He stated, "A man named Honey introduced himself as Vishal Bharadwaj's casting director and offered me a very important role. I banged the phone down not believing a word of what he said". However, after meeting Bhradwaj and hearing a script reading, he loved the story and accepted the offer. The actors Chandan Roy Sanyal, Shiv Subramnayam, Hrishikesh Joshi, Rajatava Dutta and Deb Mukherjee were cast in supporting roles. For the role of drug dealer Tashi, Bhardwaj chose his friend Tenzing Nimaa tour operator in Mussooriesaying he had the character and attitude he wanted, and a weird sense of humour.
Characters.
Bhardwaj instructed the film's entire cast and crew to watch caper classics such as "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" (1998), "Snatch" (2000), "Pulp Fiction" (1994) and "True Romance" (1993) to study the nuances and become familiar with the genre. Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did not want them to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges. Charlie’s physique was very different from Kapoor's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult.
Chopra described her character Sweety as "feisty and vivacious", like herself in real life. She said, "Sweety is very busy, and does not have time to take care of her looks and apply make up. Her only aim in life is to bunk her lectures and visit her boyfriend's college or stay in his hotel, and eventually marry him." Chopra found similarities between her character and herself; both are outspoken, fun loving and honest, and cannot hide something that is wrong. Chopra said she had a different cultural background to Sweety, and found it a big challenge to convincingly portray a blunt, Maharashtrian Marathi girl. She had to adopt body language and a Maharashtrian accent to suit the character. She learnt the Marathi language to make the character as authentic as possible, which being a Punjabi she found it difficult. She said: "I am speaking a lot of Marathi in the film. It was difficult for me because it’s a difficult language and I am not good at Marathi. But I think it’s my luck that through Kaminey I got to learn one more language."
Gupte described his character as mercurial, and found playing him a physical delight. Gupte said his character keeps the frame unpredictable and that it provided him with a foil to express rage and anguish. He worked a lot on his characterisation and tried to bring in his own references from European and Japanese cinema. Chandan Roy Sanyal described his character Mikhail as provocative, mad, wicked and humorous. Subramnayam and Joshi, who played Lobo and Lele respectively, described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti-Narcotics Bureau. They said that to prepare for the roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj's instructions to get the characters right. Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb by reading the script and understanding the characters, and discussing it with Bhardwaj. Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid that he did not have much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him.
Filming.
Principal photography commenced in mid-2008, and the film was mostly shot in Mumbai. During a late night shoot for a scene in Pune, Kapoor and Chopra had a minor accident. Chopra was supposed to ride a motorcycle with Kapoor seated on the pillion seat. Both fell off the motorcycle as it skidded on mud. Kapoor was unhurt but Chopra received scratch marks and bruises. It was reported that Kapoor suffered from several injuries while shooting. During filming, Chopra became hoarse because she had to scream her lines; an essential part of her role as an "extremely vocal Maharashtrian girl." Some important railway sequences were shot at Wadi Bunder Yard near Sandhurst Road. Kapoor found filming for both of his characters at nearly the same time very difficult; he would shoot them on alternate days.
Themes and influences.
According to the "Hindustan Times", "Kaminey" "is the first attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner." Unlike other Bollywood films, in which the heroine is Sita , the hero is Rama and the villain is Ravana, the characters in "Kaminey" are nuanced humans in "layered and complex" situations. Namrata Joshi from "Outlook" wrote that "Kaminey" reflects Bhardwaj's "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters on the margins of society and the morally compromised". Bhardwaj told "Rediff.com" that the film deals with "themes that affect our lives directly", and "is a reminder that we all have a dark side, and often we are not fully aware of that side". Rakesh Bedi from "The Economic Times" wrote, "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands. Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out." He continued, "ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a "radically different and refreshing" way, and the director "daringly takes it a step further". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, it would have been a complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)" The Daily Beast said that "for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes—estranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, high drama approaching slapstick comedy—and presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing.
Bhardwaj has been influenced by many directorsincluding Manmohan Desai, Subhash Ghai, Quentin Tarantino and Francis Ford Coppolaand combines these influences in his work. Rakesh Bedi wrote that "Bhardwaj keeps displaying his vision throughout the film". Reviewers have compared the film's multi-plot narrative to those of several films by Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and the Coen Brothers, who are considered aces of this genre. Reviewers said that the film mostly belongs to the level of "Pulp Fiction"; Shubhra Gupta of "The Indian Express" called it "Bollywood's first all-the-way-out-to-there pulp fiction". Bedi wrote, "there's Buñuel in the Bengali dons, there's Kurosawa ... in that surreal train car in which Charlie lives, there's Ray in money-floating dreams that Charlie has". The "Hindustan Times" wrote that the apocalyptical gang war in the climax is reminiscent of "Apocalypse Now". The reviewer said that, "Bhardwaj just demolishes the cliches of Bollywood. In ripping apart the stereotype, he gives us a prototype: a Bollywood that deals with alienation, ... angst, ...  and atrocity." A review in "The Times of India" said that the film's climax reaches the level of "Reservoir Dogs", and described it as "absolutely riveting stuff, with the camera going on a hitherto unexplored journey in Indian cinema."
Soundtrack.
Vishal Bhardwaj composed the music soundtrack for " Kaminey" and Gulzar wrote the lyrics. The album contains five original songs, two remixes and one theme song; it was released on 6 July 2009. Vishal Bhardwaj stated that the song "Dhan Te Nan" was not originally composed for the film, but for an episode of the television series "Gubbare" titled "Dhan Te Nan". The soundtrack album was very successful commercially after its release, especially "Dhan Te Nan", which topped the charts across various platforms.
The soundtrack album received positive reviews from music critics. Rediff.com rated the album 4.5 out of 5, labelled it a "masterpiece" and wrote, "Bhardwaj has delivered a soundtrack that is lethally explosive. Not that we expected anything less. And trust Gulzar to artfully craft a really long fuse for the Kaminey bomb, making sure the tracks stay afire long before and after they actually go boom." Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave a rating 4 out 5 and wrote, "Kaminey is certainly not a run of the mill album and this is where its prime strength lies. The album boasts of at least three chartbuster tracks'Dhan Te Nan' (sure shot superhit), 'Thode Bheege' (must for the hearts in love) and 'Raat Ke Dhai Baje' (for some 'masti' and 'hungama'). Songs like 'Fatak' and 'Kaminey' are innovative and situational which showcase the range of Vishal Bhardwaj. Add to that the 'Go Charlie Go - Theme Music' and you know that Kaminey is yet another addition to some excellent albums that have hit the stands during last one month." Planet Bollywood rated the album 8.5 out of 10 and said it is the best soundtrack released that year, and that "t has experimentations with both music and lyrics". Indo-Asian News Service praised the soundtrack and said that " ... "Kaminey" is easily among 2009's finest scores. Experimental in its sound, yet very mainstream in appeal. Vishal Bhardwaj has proved his mettle yet again."
Marketing and release.
The teaser poster of "Kaminey" was received positively by critics. The trailer, which introduces four characters; one lisping, one stuttering, a woman yelling about having raped a man and one jeering at the lisper, received positive reviews. Critics kept their expectations high due to Bhardwaj's previous films, and said the trailer was like a comic book which introduces the characters of Kapoor and Chopra differently. The theatrical trailers and the music generated interest for the film. The film's marketing also involved public appearances by Chopra and Kapoor.
The makers of the film were disappointed by the Censor Board for Film Certification's decision to grant the film an "A" certificatemeant for viewers 18 years or olderinstead of a "U/A" certificate that they had expected. Bhardwaj said, "It was injustice to us. There is no abusive language used in the film and the violence is of 'comic book kind'." The Censor Board asked him to replace dialogue which mentioned the city of Pilibhitwhich they said was a sensitive constituencywith a fictitious city name. He replaced Pilibhit with Barabanki." The film was subject to some controversies. A First Information Report was filed by Jagannath Sena Sangathan at a police station in Puri against the film for allegedly denigrating Lord Jagannath. According to them, a scene in which the text "Apna Hath Jagannath" is seen in a toilet on a semi-clad model had hurt religious sentiments. The objectionable portion of the scene was removed from the prints released in the state of Orissa. A complaint supported by a caste group backed by a Samajwadi Party MP about the use of the name of a community "teli" in the song "Dhan Te Nan"which was considered derogatory to the Teli communitywas filed with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The Censor Board reacted to the complaint, insisting on the replacement of the word, which was later replaced with "Dilli".
"Kaminey" was scheduled to release on 5 June 2009. However, the release was postponed because of problems between the producers and multiplexes in India. The film was released on 14 August 2009 on 1,200 screens worldwide. Because of the 2009 flu pandemic, the film was not released in the Maharashtra regionincluding Mumbai and Punebecause the multiplexes in these cities were closed by the Maharashtra government for three days as part of precautionary measures against swine flu. Moser Baer Home Videos released "Kaminey" on DVD in October 2009 across all regions in a two-disc pack complying with the NTSC format. One disc contains the film; the other has additional content including a "making of the film" documentary, the original beginning and deleted scenes. VCD and Blu-Ray versions were released at the same time. Bollywood Hungama critic Joginder Tuteja rated the DVD 4 out of 5, praising the bonus features and the packaging.
Airtel Digital TV premiered the film on its Pay Per View service on 12 September 2009. The Indian television premiere of the film was on Colors on 18 February 2010.

A kind of film whose success we ought all pray for, because it'll prove smart cinema works." "The Indian Express" gave a rating of 4 out of 5, calling it "Bollywood's first all-the-way-out-to-there pulp fiction". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 4 stars out of 5, called it a "must watch" and wrote, "t's an unpredictable crime drama that combines violence and dark humor in a manner that's reminiscent of the films of Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and the Coen Brothers. And yet Kaminey is so original and inventive in the manner in which it takes Bollywood's favorite formulatwin brothersand turns it on its head." He praised the writingwhich he said was the film's real strength, the non-linear screenplay and the dialogue, and wrote that the film has "the best performance you will see by an ensemble cast in a long time". Nikhat Kazmi from "The Times of India" rated the film 4 out of 5, and said it is "Bollywood's first film which is full of brains, brawn and belligerence besides being a bravura attempt to rewrite the tried and tested idiom of desi movielore. Kaminey is a smart and balsy film that brings Hollywood to Bollywood which catapult the viewer into the dark, violent world of crime and criminals, leaving you no time to blink or breathe easy ... Tarantino, take a bow. Brave new Bollywood is here."
Anupama Chopra gave a rating of 4 out of 5 and wrote "Kaminey is the best Bollywood film I’ve seen this year. It’s an audacious, original rollercoaster ride. Written and directed by Vishal Bharadwaj, Kaminey requires patience and attention but the pay off is more than worth it." Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 4 out of 5 and wrote "Kaminey is bold, stark, funny and unpredictable and is a film with an attitude. Like it or leave it, but you'd never be able to ignore it. Word from the wise: Go for this hatke (different) experience!" Zee News also rated the film 4 out of 5 and said, "Bhardwaj has once again delivered a powerful film that completely bowls you over with its splendid script, riveting narrative and stellar performances by lead pairShahid and Priyanka have a cracking on-screen chemistry that certainly reminds you of yesteryears on-screen couples." The review also said, ""Kaminey" is an engrossing flick that does not let you move from your seat!" Kaveree Bamzai of "India Today" rated the film 4 out of 5 and said it "is dark, melodramatic, poetic and ultimately operatic". He also said, "Its lyrics are the blow-up-your-brains-out kind ... and its music, composed by the multi-talented Bharadwaj is perfectly in sync with a narrative that doesn't pause for breath." Namrata Joshi from "Outlook" gave a rating of 4 out 5 and called "Kaminey" "a strikingly anarchic, unusually energetic, quirky and frenetic film". "The Hindu" praised the film, labelled it a "masterpiece" and wrote, "Kaminey takes the post-postmodern noir genre to a whole new level, to a sophistication the Indian audience isn’t used to."

His 1971 book "The Scottish Enlightenment and the American College Ideal", which argued that American education owed its roots to influential Presbyterian Scots who never feared an educated populace unlike their counterparts in the Anglican church, was a contribution to a larger ongoing intellectual discussion about Scottish and American relations (e.g., Ian Charles Cargill Graham's 1956 "Colonists from Scotland: Emigration to North America, 1707-1783" and Andrew Hook’s 1975 "Scotland and America: A Study of Cultural Relations, 1750—1835"). In the mid-1980s Sloan edited the collection of essays published as "The Computer in Education: a Critical Perspective" (Columbia University Press, 1985). His 1994 book "Faith and Knowledge: Mainline Protestantism and American Higher Education" focuses on the rise and fall of various mainline American Protestant churches' engagements with higher education, noting that this now almost forgotten and often overlooked theological renaissance—begun by evangelicals of neo-orthodoxy in the 1930s—would fully blossom in March 1953 with the launch of an essentially new journal "The Christian Scholar". Its morph into the journal "Soundings" fifteen years later would signal the renaissance's abrupt end.

Tithe Barn, Pilton

The Tithe Barn at Cumhill Farm in Pilton, Somerset, England, was built in the 14th century as a tithe barn to hold produce for Glastonbury Abbey. It is a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument.
The barn, of coursed and squared rubble, was originally built in the 14th and 15th centuries to hold the produce from farms in the area who paid one tenth of their produce to Glastonbury Abbey as the landowner. It is one of four surviving monastic barns built by the Abbey.
Restoration.
On 9 June 1963 lightning set fire to the thatched roof and it remained a wreck until Michael Eavis, organiser of the Glastonbury Festival, bought it in 1995, and presented the barn to the Pilton Barn Trust.
The project was made possible with a grant of £400,000 from English Heritage. The Glastonbury festival contributed a further £100,000.
A new roof, replicating the original, using a combination of traditional carpentry techniques and modern technology, has been built, by Peter McCurdy using skills used when recreating the Globe theatre in London, from English oak which came from Northumberland. The roof frame consists of cruck construction which sit high in the walls with an arcade plate then carrying the apex of the roof above.
McCurdy was also assisted by a local team run by Jon Maine who designed and erected the complex scaffolding both internally and externally and then using 8000 36" long oak hand split (riven) battens tiled the roof using over 30,000 hand made plain tiles.
In addition to the new roof a new floor was laid, including a wide strip in Blue Lias Stone and 44 cubic meters of lime concrete used to fill the expanses either side. It is said to be the largest expanse of lime concrete flooring anywhere in Europe.
The restoration was nominated for the annual Wood Awards, which recognise and encourage outstanding design, craftmanship and installation in joinery and structures in wood. It was awarded the prize as the Best Use of British Timber Award and Structural Timber Award in 2005. It also received the Royal Institute of British Architects Town and Country Design Award in the same year.
It was officially opened on Friday 1 April 2005 by local historian Sir John Keegan and is now used for public events such as medieval fairs and dances, as well as working as a real farm building for the rest of the time.

Confederate Memorial Gates in Mayfield

The Confederate Memorial Gates in Mayfield are historical monuments that represent the entrance to Maplewood Cemetery in Mayfield, Kentucky. The monuments were the second monument in Mayfield the United Daughters of the Confederacy established, the first being the Confederate Memorial in Mayfield in downtown Mayfield. The Gates were the third choice for monuments, chosen mostly due to their relative low cost. The UDC meant for them to not only be a monument to those residents of Graves county who served the Confederate States of America, but were also intended to be a civic improvement. 
The monuments are three pairs of stuccoed poured concrete gateposts, six in total. When closed. the main pair's gate says "The United Daughters of the Confederacy Memorial". Only the main pair have bronze plaques. The main pair are each two feet wide and ten feet tall, with 27 feet between them.

<doc id="20040246" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20040246" title="Japanese expatriates in the Netherlands">
Japanese expatriates in the Netherlands

Japanese people in the Netherlands include expatriates from Japan and their Japanese citizen children, as well as Dutch citizens of Japanese ancestry.
There were 7,524 persons of Japanese origin living in the Netherlands , according to the figures of the Statistics Netherlands office. In general, they are transient foreign residents employed by Japanese companies.
Demography and distribution.
According to a 1996 survey, 80% of Japanese in the Netherlands consist of Japanese company employees and their families. Another 10% are Japanese civil servants on overseas postings, researchers, and students. The remainder were long-term residents, largely Japanese women married to Dutch men. Most live in Amsterdam. However, there are also about 150 living in Maastricht, mostly employees of Mitsubishi and their spouses and children.
Statistics Netherlands' 2009 figures with regards to persons of Japanese background show:
For a total of 7,524 persons. This represented growth of about 2.4% over the previous year's total, and about 18% over the total for 1996, the earliest year for which statistics are made available. However, they still form only a minute proportion, little over two-tenths of a percent, of all persons of foreign background in the Netherlands.
Employment.
The workplace is one of the most important sites of cross-cultural encounters for Japanese working in the Netherlands. Japanese company offices in the Netherlands are generally small in size, numbering less than 100 employees. The decision-making processes in Japanese and Dutch corporate cultures are superficially similar, both relying on achieving consensus from stakeholders and subordinates rather than devolving decision-making authority to a single person. The need for Japanese expatriate middle-managers to refer plans back to headquarters in Japan, in addition to the emphasis on collective responsibility for the results of plans agreed to by consensus, means that decision-making in Japanese companies proceeds more slowly than in Dutch companies. Nevertheless, Dutch employees in Japanese companies perceive the decision-making process as achieving better and more thorough results despite its slow pace.
Japanese expatriate employees in the Netherlands put in longer hours than local employees. Dutch employees feel that their Japanese superiors and colleagues put in such long hours because they use their time inefficiently; furthermore, they feel little pressure to adopt those same working hours, asserting that the Japanese managers simply receive more benefits and salary in line with their increased responsibility. However, their Japanese colleagues resent this attitude, feeling that Dutch colleagues "leave work undone on their desk and go home", leaving it for the late-working Japanese to complete. Japanese managers find they have to delineate job requirements and responsibilities more explicitly for Dutch employees than they would for Japanese employees in Japan, due to the local cultural emphasis on individual responsibility above collective responsibility.
Cuisine.
When eating outside the home, Japanese expatriates in the Netherlands most commonly patronise Chinese restaurants (29% of meals eaten out); Japanese restaurants run a close second at 25%, Italian restaurants at 19%, and French restaurants at 10%. However, they deride the Japanese restaurants of the Netherlands as low-quality and expensive. They also cook Japanese food at home, though in a pattern different from that in Japan; they consume less fish and more meat dishes (especially "nikujaga"), and often have to find substitutes for preferred vegetables which are unavailable locally. Preparing Japanese food is often viewed as troublesome due to these limitations, and many Japanese wives express that they only prepare such dishes because their husbands prefer them; when the husbands are away, they cook Western-style food instead. However, the community in Amsterdam at least have some Japanese-style grocery stores available locally. For the community in Maastricht, fewer such options are available; many cross the border to Germany to do their shopping in Düsseldorf and take advantage of the many specialised grocery shops which have popped up to serve the city's significant Japanese community, or band together and order groceries—especially fish prepared in the Japanese style—to be shipped down from Amsterdam. Another common option is to grow herb seasonings, especially garland chrysanthemum, perilla, and cryptotaenia, in one's own back garden.
Education.
Amsterdam has one Japanese-medium day school, The Japanese School of Amsterdam. There is also the Japanese School of Rotterdam.
There is also a Japanese weekend school in Maastricht, founded in 1992 as an outgrowth of the Joppenhoff International School. It began with 15 students, and grew as large as 30, but declined in concert with the economy, and as of 2004 enrolled just 20 students.

Mount Washington Transit Tunnel

Mount Washington Transit Tunnel is an important public transportation link in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The approximately tunnel connects Station Square to South Hills Junction, and is used only by Pittsburgh Light Rail cars and buses of the Port Authority of Allegheny County. 
History.
The tunnel was built by Booth and Flinn, as a replacement for the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Tunnel, but at a lower elevation. Excavation was started October 6, 1902, and the tunnel was officially opened December 1, 1904, for use by trolleys/streetcars only. Originally, steam powered trains ran through the tunnel, to be replaced by the first electric cars in 1909. It took over the transportation functions of the Castle Shannon Railway tunnel, which was originally a coal mine, but later used as a tunnel to transport coal, and later passengers, under Mt. Washington. Although this tunnel was closed to passengers in 1880, the urban legend persists that the Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel was originally a coal mine.
The tunnel was upgraded to allow for joint use by bus and trolley traffic in 1973, with several changes since.
Accidents.
Two spectacular runaway accidents are associated with the tunnel, which is on a steep gradient averaging over 6 percent, and curves as the north portal is reached.
On December 24, 1917, Knoxville service car 4236 ran away downhill after becoming detached from the wire and derailed and overturned on the curve into Carson Street. The car slid on its side until hitting a telegraph pole which ripped the roof off. Twenty-one people were killed and 80 were injured; the claims from the accident sent Pittsburgh Railways into receivership.
On October 29, 1987, a 1700-series all-electric PCC car began to exceed the tunnel's speed limit as it entered the south portal after departing South Hills Junction. The operator, realizing the car could neither stop nor take the sharp curve from the transitway to the Panhandle Bridge ramp, ordered all the passengers to move to the back, and radioed the PAT central dispatcher to clear Station Square. The car left the rails and took Smithfield Street instead (the trolleys' original route downtown, until 1985), crossing Carson Street, sideswiping a PAT bus and a truck, and knocking out a fire hydrant. Miraculously, the car stayed on its wheels, and finally stopped next to the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, the former Pittsburgh and Lake Erie station building at Station Square. Thirty-seven people were injured, four seriously, but there were no fatalities. All three braking systems on the car had failed: the drum, dynamic, and magnetic rail brakes. Most of the 1700 series cars were found to have electrical defects, prompting PAT to retire all of their remaining PCC's that had not been rebuilt as 4000 series cars. Consequently, PAT was left with a shortage of cars, which contributed to the closure of the Overbrook line in 1993.

Tal Harris

Charles "Tal" Harris (4 February 1902 - 1 October 1963) was a Welsh international rugby union scrum-half who represented Wales and played club rugby for Aberavon.
Rugby career.
Harris played for Aberavon during their 'golden era' which saw the team crowned Welsh Club Champions four consecutive years from the 1923/24 to the 1926/27 season. While playing for Aberavon, Harris was awarded his one and only Welsh cap against the Touring Australian Waratahs. The match took place on 26 November 1927 at the Cardiff Arms Park, and although the Welsh forwards showed strength and commitment, were out-classed by the tourist back play.
In 1931, while still with Aberavon, Harris was part of the joint Neath / Aberavon team that narrowly lost to the 1931 touring South Africans. Harris was challenged to the position by Neath's Cliff Evans, but Harris was considered more experienced and tougher. The match was a close contest, and with three minuted left on the clock the score line was 3-3 after the Welsh side had taken an early lead; but the tourist fought back and scored a try with the last move of the game. During the match, Harris and his Aberavon team mate Wilf Selby were considered the better pairing than the South African duo of Danie Craven and Bennie Osler, but the Welsh team's threequarter line was believed to have let them down with slow distribution.

Hubert "Hubsi" von Meyerinck (23 August 1896 – 13 May 1971) was a German film actor. He appeared in more than 280 films between 1921 and 1970. 
Life.
Meyerinck was born in Potsdam, Brandenburg, the son of Friedrich von Meyerinck (1858–1928), Hauptmann (Captain) in the Prussian Army. He grew up at his family's estates in the Province of Posen and attended the gymnasium secondary school in Godeberg. Having passed his Abitur exams, he was called up for military service as a cadet in World War I, but soon was dismissed due to a pulmonary disease.
In 1917 he gave his debut as a theatre actor at the Schauspielhaus in Berlin and from 1918 to 1920 continued his career at the Hamburg Kammerspiele. Back in Berlin he performed in avant-garde plays by Carl Sternheim, as well as in several revue entertainments and kabarett venues. Later he returned to classical theatre with engagements at the Deutsches Theater and the Lessing Theater, performing as "The Imaginary Invalid", "Mephistopheles", but also as "Captain of Köpenick" or as "Meckie Messer" in Brecht's "Threepenny Opera".
From 1920 onwards, Meyerinck starred as a silent film actor, whereby he developed a distinctive appearance with his high forehead and moustache, often emphasizing his hypnotic expression by sporting a monocle. He was able to continue his career in the sound film era by his unmistakable rasping voice, which perfectly added to his physiognomy, having a standing order for scoundrels and charlatan roles.
Commonly identified as a homosexual he ran the risk to be imprisoned by the Nazi authorities like his friend Kurt von Ruffin, nevertheless he performed in numerous entertainment films of Nazi cinema. After World War II, Meyerinck remained one of the busiest film actors in West German cinema. He starred as quirky official, devious noble or impostor in numerous film comedies, often together with Peter Alexander and young Ilja Richter but also in several Edgar Wallace films of the 1960s. He also continued as a theatre actor, from 1966 in the ensemble of the Thalia Theater in Hamburg.
Meyerinck died from heart failure in Hamburg. He is buried in the Schladen cemetery near Braunschweig.

<doc id="20040379" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20040379" title="Urakaze-class destroyer">
Urakaze-class destroyer

The were a class of two destroyers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy by Yarrow Shipbuilders of Scotland. These were the last Japanese destroyers ordered from overseas shipyards.
Background.
The failure of Japanese shipbuilders with the "Umikaze"-class destroyers left the Japanese navy without a large destroyer capable of extended blue ocean operations. The Parsons steam turbines of the "Umikaze" class were plagued with maintenance issues, as well as tremendous fuel consumption. The navy then returned to its previous mainstay for new technology and equipment, Yarrow shipyards in the United Kingdom, ordering two vessels to a new design in the 1911 fiscal budget. 
However, Yarrow, along with other British shipyards, had a large backlog of orders, and it was not until 1915 that the new vessels could be completed, and due to the outbreak of World War I, not until 1919 before "Urakaze" was turned over to Japan.
Design.
The "Urakaze"-class vessels made use of oil-fired Brown-Curtiss turbine engines, and had the distinction of being the first vessels built for Japan to be designed for use without coal. The initial design called for diesel engines, however, due to the outbreak of World War I, Yarrow could not obtain necessary gear components from Germany.
Armament was slightly less than that of the "Umikaze" class, with a single QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I – IV mounted on a small shelter forward and four QF 3 inch 12 pounder guns, two amidships, one of the stern, and one mounted on a tall pedestal just aft of the smokestacks. The "Urakaze" class was also the first Japanese class of destroyers to use the 533-mm diameter torpedoes.
Operational history.
"Urakaze" was turned over to the Imperial Japanese Navy too late to see combat service in World War I. It was used for many years in patrols on the Yangzi River. It was retired in 1936, and used as a training vessel for the Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Forces. It was sunk in an air attack by United States Navy aircraft on July 18, 1945. It should not be confused with the later of World War II.
Due to a strong request from the British government, "Kawakaze" was sold by Japan prior to completion to the Regia Marina of Italy. Italy was one of the Allies of World War I, and faced a severe shortage of modern warships. "Kawakaze" was completed as "Audace", and later renamed "San Marco", and saw considerable combat service in the Mediterranean. During World War II, it was captured by the German "Kriegsmarine", and renamed "TA 20". It was sunk in Action of 1 November 1944 near Pag Island in the Adriatic Sea. It should not be confused with the later of World War II.

The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group (ALDE/ADLE) is the current liberal–centrist political group of the European Parliament. It is made up of MEPs from two European political parties, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (formerly the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party) and the European Democratic Party, which collectively form the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
ALDE is one of the three oldest Groups, dating its unofficial origin back to September 1952 and the first meeting of the Parliament's predecessor, the Common Assembly. Founded as an explicitly Liberal Group, it has expanded its remit to cover the different centrist traditions of each new Member State as they acceded to the Union, progressively changing its name in the process.
It is the third-largest Group in the Parliament and does not participate in the "Grand Coalition" (the coalition designed to provide a majority) for the Sixth Parliament (2004–2009). It did however partner with the EPP-ED to form the Grand Coalition for the Fifth Parliament, during which time it achieved its sole President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox.
The pro-European platform of the group espouses neoliberal economics, and support for European integration and the European single market.
History.
The ALDE Group can trace its unofficial ancestry back to the Liberal members present at the first meeting of the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community (the Parliament's predecessor) on 10 September 1952, but the Group was officially founded as the "Group of Liberals and Allies" on 23 June 1953.
As the Assembly grew into the Parliament, the French Gaullists split from the Group on 21 January 1965 and the Group started the process of changing its name to match the liberal/centrist traditions of the new member states, firstly to the "Liberal and Democratic Group" in 1976, then to the "Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group" on 13 December 1985, then to the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party on 19 July 1994 to match the European political party of the same name.
In 1999, the Group partnered with European People's Party–European Democrats (EPP-ED) group to form the "Grand Coalition" for the Fifth Parliament. The customary split of the Presidency of the European Parliament between Groups in the Coalition meant that the Group achieved its first President of the European Parliament on 15 January 2002, when Pat Cox was elected to the post to serve the latter half of the five-year term. The Group lost its Grand Coalition status after the 2004 elections.
On 13 July 2004 the Group approved a recommendation to unite with MEPs from the centrist and social-liberal political party at the European level called the European Democratic Party (EDP) founded by François Bayrou's Union for French Democracy, the Labour Party of Lithuania and Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy of Italy.
The Group accordingly became the "Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe" (ALDE) on 20 July 2004, to match the eponymous transnational political alliance, although the two European-level parties remained separate outside the European Parliament. The MEP Graham Watson of the British Liberal Democrats became the first chair of ALDE.
Structure.
Subgroups.
ALDE is a coalition of liberal and centrist MEPs. It does not have formal subgroups, although the MEPs fall naturally into two informal subgroups, depending on whether they associate with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party or the European Democratic Party.
Organisation.
The Bureau is the main decision making body of the ALDE Group and is composed of the leaders of the delegations from each member state that elects ALDE MEPs. The Bureau oversees the ALDE Group's main strategy and policies and is headed by a chair (referred to as the "Leader"). The day-to-day running of the Group is performed by its secretariat, led by its Secretary-General.
The senior staff of ALDE as of July 2012 are as follows:
The chairs of ALDE and its predecessors from 1953 to 24 October 2008 are as follows:
Membership.
Membership by party in Sixth and Seventh Parliaments.
The national parties that are members of ALDE are as follows:

An April 2010 European Parliament document gave the percentage of MEPs for each Group and member state at that date. The results for ALDE are given on the diagram on the right.
The document shows that ALDE, as of April 2010, does not draw its MEPs evenly from throughout the EU. Its smallest support is in the Iberian peninsula, Central Europe, and Greece. Its largest support comes from Scandinavia, the Baltic states and the non-Greek Balkans. Only one member state (Estonia) has more than 50% of its MEPs sitting with the ALDE Group. Countries with no ALDE MEPs include Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Austria, Poland and Portugal. Note that since April 2010 there have been changes in the numbers presented above (e.g. a Greek party with one MEP joined ALDE).
Membership at formation.
In September 1952, the third-largest grouping in the Common Assembly was the Liberal grouping with 11 members. The Group of Liberals and Allies was officially founded on 23 June 1953. By mid-September 1953, it was again the third-largest Group with 10 members.
Activities.
In the news.
Activities performed by ALDE in the period between 2004 and 2008 that resulted in an entry on EUObserver or theparliament.com include:

The debates and votes in the European Parliament are tracked by its website and categorized by the Groups that participate in them and the rule of procedure that they fall into. The results give a profile for each Group by category and the total indicates the Group's level of participation in Parliamentary debates. The activity profile for each Group for the period 1 August 2004 to 1 August 2008 in the Sixth Parliament is given on the diagram on the right. ALDE is denoted in yellow.
The website shows ALDE as participating in 661 motions, making it the second most active Group during the period.
Publications.
ALDE produces many publications, on its website. Its key documents cover the Treaty of Lisbon, the global financial crisis of 2008, civil liberties and its 10 priorities for the 2009 elections.
Academic analysis.
Along with the other political groups, ALDE has been analysed by academics on its positions regarding various issues. Those positions are summarized in this article. That article characterizes ALDE as cohesive, gender-balanced centrist Euroneutrals that cooperate most closely with the EPP, are ambiguous on hypothetical EU taxes and supportive of eventual full Turkish accession to the European Union.

Forever Version

Forever Version is the debut album from Jamaican reggae deejay Dennis Alcapone. It was released in 1971 by Studio One, and features Alcapone toasting over some of the label's greatest hits. The album was engineered by Sylvan Morris who left large parts of the original vocal tracks in the mix, with Alcapone appearing to answer back to the singers. Tracks which formed the basis for the album include Larry Marshall's "Nanny Goat" (on "Nanny Goat Version"), The Cables' "Baby Why", Carlton and The Shoes' "Love Me Forever" ("Forever Version"), two tracks from The Heptones ("Baby Version" and "Sweet Talking Version"), and one from The Wailers ("Dancing Version"). The album was reissued by Heartbeat Records on compact disc in 1991, and again in an expanded form in 2007, with six bonus tracks.

Jacob Earl Fickel

Major General Jacob Earl "Jake" Fickel (31 January 1883 – 7 August 1956) had a prominent career in the United States Air Force usually associated with being an instructor of aviation. He is credited with firing the first recorded gunshot ever from an airplane showing that a plane would not break up due to the gun's recoil.
Biography.
Fickel enlisted in the Regular Army when he was twenty one years of age. He served as a private, corporal, sergeant, and first sergeant of Company K, 27th Infantry. He was stationed at Fort Hayes, Fort Sheridan and Fort Leavenworth. In 1907 Fickel was commissioned as a second lieutenant of Infantry. He then joined the 29th Infantry at Fort Douglas. In August of that year he went with that regiment for the Philippine Islands and served at Fort William McKinley with 2d Lt. Henry H. Arnold. In 1909 Fickel returned to the United States for station at Fort Jay. He was there through 1911. He then went to Fort Niagara until November 1913.
Fickel then went for a second tour of duty in the Philippine Islands with the 13th Infantry. He served at Fort William McKinley again and at Camp McGrath until March 1917. He was then assigned to duty as an instructor at the Officers Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison. There he remained until November of that year. Fickel was then ordered to Washington, D.C., for duty with the Headquarters of the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. He served in that capacity until May 1918.
Fickel was next ordered to Rockwell Field in California as a student officer at the flying school. Upon completion of his course in November 1918 he assumed command of Carruthers Field in Texas where he remained until January 1919. Fickel was then ordered back to Washington, D.C. There he served in the Office of the Chief of Air Service until March 1921. His next duty was with the Spruce Production Corporation Portland, Oregon. There he served until the summer of 1922. He then returned to Washington for a two-year tour of duty as Chief of the Supply Division of the Air Service.
In June 1925 Fickel graduated from the Air Corps Technical School at Langley Field. In June 1926 he also graduated with honors from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth. His next tour of duty was to serve as executive officer of the Materiel Division at McCook Field until April 1927. He then attended the Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field in Texas for three months. Fickel then returned to McCook Field where he reassumed his duties as executive officer, Materiel Division, for a period of three years.
Fickel then attended the Army War College in Washington, D.C. He graduated in June 1931. His next duty was as Chief of the Buildings and Grounds Division in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps, Washington, D.C. He was there until January 1935. From February 1935 to June 1936, Fickel was Commandant of the Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field. His next tour of duty was as Air Officer of the Ninth Corps Area, with Headquarters at the Presidio of San Francisco, California. He was there until March 1939. He was then assigned to command the 1st Wing, General Headquarters Air Force at March Field in California. 
In February 1940, he was appointed Assistant Chief of Air Corps in Washington, D.C. He was later assigned to Riverside, California, in 1940, as Air District Commander, becoming the first Commanding General of the Fourth Air Force on December 18, 1940. After an inordinately high rate of accidents involving Lockheed P-38 Lightnings in his command, he was relieved of command on April 2, 1942, on the orders of his friend Hap Arnold, now commanding the Army Air Forces, and reassigned to command the District No. 3 (Western) Technical Training Command, Oklahoma, on March 5, 1942. Fickel retired in 1946.
Notability.
Fickel is credited with firing the first recorded gunshot ever from an airplane on August 20, 1910. From his passenger seat he fired a rifle twice at a target from an altitude of 100 feet with Glenn H. Curtiss flying the airplane. It was done at Sheepshead Bay Race Track near New York City. This proved that a gun could be fired from an airplane without the plane breaking up into pieces due to the gun’s recoil. 
He repeated the feat at an air show in the summer of 1911 at Nassau Boulevard airfield on Long Island with Arnold at the controls. Competing against a team of Britons, Thomas Sopwith and Malcolm Campbell, the Americans won easily when Fickel displayed a skill that enabled him to put six bullets through a dinner plate from an aircraft flying off the ground.
Fickel became the first aerial gunner in America. These experiments led to low recoil machine guns. Soon thereafter machine guns were added to planes for air-to-ground attack or air-to-air fighting. The first airplane machine guns were patented by Samuel Neal McClean. He sold his rights to the Automatic Arms Company in late 1910. Issac N. Lewis working for the company later improved the technology on this airplane machine gun system.
The first use of an airplane machine gun in combat was in August 1914 with the first recorded airplane shot down in air-to-air fighting in October of that year. By 1915 air combat was an integral part of World War I fighting.
Gen. Fickel was the brother-in-law of glider pioneer, Lawrence Malcolm Allison, of Lawrence, Kansas.

Philip Hamburger

Philip Hamburger is an American legal scholar.
Hamburger is the Maurice and Hilda Friedman Professor of Law at the Columbia University School of Law. He is a legal historian and a scholar of constitutional law. Before moving to Columbia, Hamburger was John P. Wilson Professor at the University of Chicago Law School, where he was also Director of the Bigelow Program and the Legal History Program. He was previously Oswald Symyster Colclough Research Professor at George Washington University Law School and, before that, he taught at the University of Connecticut Law School. He has been a Visiting Professor at the University of Virginia Law School and was the Jack N. Pritzker Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Northwestern Law School. Early in his career, he was an Associate at the law firm of Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis LLP in Philadelphia.
Hamburger holds a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School (1982) and a Bachelor of Arts from Princeton University (1979).
Scholarship.
Hamburger is a leading scholar of the First Amendment who "made a valuable contribution to our knowledge of Jefferson's thinking and actions with respect to matters of church and state". He is known for arguing that “the First Amendment, originally thought to limit the government, has been increasingly interpreted by the Court to mean limiting religion and confining it to the private sphere.”
Fruchtman, reviewing "Law and Judicial Duty" (2008), says it, "is by any definition ground-breaking. It is a creative, magisterial contribution to our understanding of judicial review and an independent judiciary."
Justice Hugo Black, who served on the Supreme Court 1937 to 1971, came under attack from Hamburger who argues that Black's views on the need for separation of Church and State were deeply tainted by prominent roles in the Ku Klux Klan, a vehemently anti-Catholic organization. Hamburger relies on Black's biographers who say he was a KKK member and actively campaigned for Senate in 1926 at nearly all of Alabama's 148 KKK Klaverns, where he attacked the Catholic Church. Biographer Newman quotes his campaign manager as saying Black "could make the best anti-Catholic speech you ever heard."

James Aspinall Turner

James Aspinall Turner (1797 - 28 September 1867) was a British businessman, entomologist and Whig politician.
James was the son of John Turner of Mayfield, near Bolton, and his wife Elizabeth Aspinall of Liverpool. He was a descendant of John Turner who had fought against the Old Pretender in 1715.
Turner was a prominent cotton manufacturer and merchant in Manchester. He made his home at Pendlebury Hall and was a magistrate and deputy lieutenant of Lancashire. In 1845 he formed the Manchester Commercial Association. The association, of which he was president, was a protectionist body that broke away from the pro-free trade Manchester Chamber of Commerce.
In the mid-nineteenth century the parliamentary borough of Manchester was represented by two Radical members of parliament, John Bright and Thomas Milner Gibson. In order to unseat them the Conservative Party stood aside at the 1857 general election and Turner and John Potter were elected as "Palmerstonian Whigs". In 1858 he was appointed a member of the royal commission on army clothing. He stood down from parliament at the 1865 general election.
Apart from his business and political activities, Turner was a renowned entomologist. He founded the Manchester Field Naturalist Club, and was a member of the Royal Entomological Society. He was chairman of the committee of Manchester New College (now Harris Manchester College, Oxford) from 1840-1852.
J A Turner died in London in September 1867, aged 70.

Lyme Regis railway station

Lyme Regis railway station was the terminus of the Lyme Regis branch line in the west of the English county of Dorset. Serving the coastal resort town of Lyme Regis, it was sited high above the town centre as a result of the hilly nature of the local area. The line straddled the county boundary so that although the terminus was in Dorset most of the line lay in the neighbouring county of Devon.
History.
Opened under the Light Railways Act 1896, it was operated from the start by the London and South Western Railway. The line then passed on to the Southern Railway in 1923 and the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. It was then transferred to the Western Region in 1962, but the station and branch line were closed by the British Railways Board in November 1965.
Buildings.
A small wooden building served the single platform. The station also had a signal box and engine shed, and a small goods shed. 
The station closed with the branch in 1965.
The site today.
The former site is now a small industrial estate. The station building was moved to Alresford on the Watercress Line, a heritage line in nearby Hampshire.

<doc id="20040558" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20040558" title="Blagaj">
Blagaj

Blagaj is a village-town ("kasaba") in the south-eastern region of the Mostar basin, in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It stands at the edge of Bišće plain and is one of the most valuable mixed urban and rural structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina, distinguished from other similar structures in its urban layout. Blagaj was most likely named for its mild weather patterns since "blaga" in Bosnian means "mild".
Blagaj is situated at the spring of the Buna river and a historical tekke ("tekija" or Dervish monastery). The Blagaj Tekija was built around 1520, with elements of Ottoman architecture and Mediterranean style and is considered a national monument.
Source.
The source of the Buna river ("Vrelo Bune") is a strong karstic spring. The river flows west for approximately 9 kilometres and joins the Neretva near the village Buna. The historic site of the Old Blagaj Fort ("Stjepan grad"), on the hill above Blagaj, was the seat of Herzegovinian nobleman, Stjepan Vukčić, and the birthplace of Bosnian queen Katarina Kosača-Kotromanić.
History.
During the classical antiquity there existed an Illyrian fortress and a Roman "castrum". During the reign of Byzantine Emperor Justinian, several fortified towns were built in the area. Blagaj was mentioned in Constantine Porphyrogenitus’ work De Administrando Imperio as Bona, then part of Zahumlje ("Hum"). 
In the late 12th century, during the rule of Stefan Nemanja (Grand Principality of Serbia), prefect Jurko raised a church dedicated to saints Cosmas and Damian. In the 14th century, during the reign of Bosnian Ban Stjepan II Kotromanić, Hum became part of the Bosnian state. In the 15th century Sandalj Hranić Kosača and his nephew Stephen Vukčić Kosača ruled the Hum and Blagaj territory until the arrival of the Ottomans in 1466. Blagaj is also known as a residential area of Bosnian rulers and particularly of royal families Hranić and Kosača. 
In historical sources Blagaj was first mentioned in 1423. During the period of the Ottoman Empire, Blagaj was the seat of the Blagaj Vilayet, and was divided into several neighborhoods. The city had seven mosques, two inns, four musafirhana, a madrasah (Bosnian: "medresa"), two maktab, seven mills and four stone bridges on the river Buna. Bosniaks were majority until 1835, during the Austro-Hungarian period Christians constituted twice as many. An Orthodox Church was built in 1893 and a Roman Catholic church in 1908.
Architecture.
The earliest Blagaj settlement was located at the foot of the Blagaj fort, where the road runs down from the fort and intersects with the Nevesinje road. There was too little trade for a commercial centre to emerge and in an agricultural environment of this kind the circumstances did not give rise to an urban settlement.The urbanization of the area (in the form we know today) was defined in the second half of the 15th century, and its structure was shaped during the 16th century.
Historical sources frequently refer to mediaeval fortress Blagaj Fort ("Stjepan grad") as a distinct territorial entity. During the Ottoman period construction of buildings was initiated in the fortress outskirts (houses and public edifices.
The residential areas were formed as urban quarters or mahalas, with buildings facing inwards - onto their courtyards. Resident complexes display evidence of a high standard of living and the Velagić house complex is one of the most valuable of this type in Herzegovina. The town mostly developed along the right bank of river Buna because the left bank is somewhat steeper and less suitable for construction. 
Public buildings were positioned quite deliberately within the urban structure as a whole. Among the first edifices was the Careva (Imperial) mosque constructed in 1521, which helped the settlement acquire the status of kasaba. It was followed by the construction of Karađoz-beg bridge from 1570 and then the Leho bridge. 
Using bold structural solutions played a vital role in architecture of Blagaj: addition of pillars and vaults, along with other structural elements, is quite evident. Barrel vaults, which were common in mosques, the tekke and the hammam – were raised to a high degree of perfection and made an entirely free ground plan possible. The synchronization of artisan crafts and construction techniques on the one hand and the development of the settlement on the other has left a mark on the Blagaj's image as a distinctive urban centre in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
During the reign of Austro-Hungarian Empire, Blagaj still retained its oriental-settlement character in its overall appearance as well as in its architectural and compositional details despite the obvious deterioration of the urban fabric.

1790 Footprints

The 1790 Footprints refer to a set of footprints found near the Kīlauea volcano in present-day Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the island of Hawaii. Resulting from an unusually explosive eruption, they are associated with a series of battles in the area in 1790.
The time of unification.
The 1782 Battle of Mokuōhai gave Kamehameha I control of the West and North sides of the island of Hawaiii, but Keōua Kuahuula and his uncle Keawemauhili were able to escape. 
For a few years, Kamehameha was occupied with Maui and the arrival of Europeans to Kona, Keōua ruled Kaū and Keawemauhili ruled Hilo.
Keawemauhili finally recognized Kamehameha as his help. This angered Keōua who raided some of the lands of Kamehameha while he was in Maui at the Battle of Kepaniwai.
Keōua then attacked and killed his uncle at Hilo. Kamehameha returned from Maui to the Big Island, and Keōua ambushed them in a thick forest of Paauhau, but the battle was inconclusive (near coordinates ). Kamehameha counterattacked and drove Keōua back, in what is known as the "Battle of Koapapaʻa". Kamehameha had brought a cannon salvaged from the ship "Fair American" captured at Kaūpūlehu. Keōua captured the piece, but did not have gunpowder nor expertise to use it effectively. After heavy losses on both sides, the commanders each decided to retreat to their secure territory. 
The footprints were thought to have been left by Keōua's forces in their retreat. While passing Kīlauea, they made offerings to the goddess Pele and made camp. As the volcano started to erupt, they thought they might have made some offense, so he split his group into three and stayed to make more offerings.
Two parties of warriors were overwhelmed by a pyroclastic eruption while crossing the desert. Only one party of three survived the eruption. The footprints were attributed by early geologist Thomas Jaggar to those warriors who were killed in this event.
Keōua would be killed later in 1791 at Kawaihae.
The Ancient Hawaiians kept elaborate oral histories, but did not accurately count years from the Christian era.
One important event in the oral history was "Ke one helelei" which means "the falling sand" in the Hawaiian Language.
This corresponded to an eruption witnessed in 1790 by British sailor John Young.
It probably was given the specific name because it was an unusual kind of eruption for Hawaiian volcanoes.
Surveyor Frederick S. Lyman used the 1790 date to estimate people's birthdates during his 1857 tax assessment.
New research.
More recent research indicates that some or all of the footprints may in fact be attributable to everyday activities, and not to the war parties.
Extensive surveys were done in 1998 and 2000 including radiocarbon dating the few samples of charcoal that could be found. A large number of habitation sites and trails were counted, indicating the area was in use for hundreds of years during the eruption cycle of 1500 to 1790.
Modern forensic techniques applied in 2008 determined that many of the footprints were made by women and children, not warriors.
They were probably already in the area chipping off sharp chunks of glass to use as tools, and left the footprints while escaping during a lull in the eruption.
Keōua's groups, however, were at the summit, and some were killed instantly by the following blast of poison gas, not by the actual falling of the ash.
Although sometimes called "fossilized", the imprints are not old enough to be true fossils. The fine ash was probably made into thick mud by a rain triggered in the eruption, which then quickly solidified in the tropical sun and was preserved in the arid desert.
Recognition.
The footprints were found accidentally by geologist Ruy H. Finch in the hardened ash of the Kaʻū Desert. 
He was trying to investigate a 1919 eruption that produced "Mauna Iki" (small mountain).
Although the National Park had been formed by then, these lands were owned by the Territory of Hawaii.
In 1938 the area was proposed as a bombing practice range, resulting in protest from conservation groups.
On June 20, 1938 the Federal Government bought the land to add to the park, with the bombing range limited to four and a half square miles. The Army never used the land, but the Navy caused some injuries to fishermen in 1945. In June 1950 the bombing range was returned to the park after being cleared of unexploded ordnance.
In 1941 the Civilian Conservation Corps built a trail and shelter.
It is Hawaii state archaeological site number 10-61-5505,
and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on August 7, 1974 as site number 74000351.
To access the area, park southwest of the park headquarters on the Hawaii Belt Road, State Highway 11. From this trailhead (coordinates ) the "Footprints Trail" leads about a mile southeast to the area. For a longer hike, start at the "Kaū Desert" trailhead on "Crater Rim Drive" at coordinates . and hike for about five miles (8 km) through the area. These trails or roads might be closed during high levels of volcanic activity; check conditions in advance.

Urë Vajgurore

Urë Vajgurore is a town in Berat District, Berat County, central Albania. Ura Vajgurore is a town in the District of Berat in Albania.
History.
Ruins of feet built bridge Gorica style of that found as a witness to the existence of early inhabitants of the first foundation of the later town. The city today has originated from displacement of residents of villages around almost 100 years ago. Building bridges in different periods of history on the banks of the river has been the continuity of city life, known by various names, such as "Bridge of Hasan Bey" etc., but the name comes from an existing cement iron bridge, which believed to be built by the Italians that the tubes used for transfer of oil from Kucova go to Vlore, residents call the Old Bridge. Today is a small provincial town, with his normal life, transition joints between Berat and Kucova.
Geography.
The town is situated near the mountains bases and Osum river.
Demographics.
The population is composed of a mix between locals who are on the other side of town, with mostly adjectives Orthodox and the rest of origin, immigrants of the 1960s onwards, come from villages above Portland, and from nearby villages as Fief, Kutalli, Konizbalte, etc.. Primarily a middle-aged population decrease, which stand out very young. Like all societies in transition here, in recent years seen increased immigration external and internal, and immigration of people from mountainous villages of Berat. The economy is recognized early for surface mining of stone, recently for processing granulated stone, lime, etc.. The main activities are trade, transport, etc..
Culture.
Being a provincial area does not differ to any maximum level of cultural activities, however there are a considerable number of educated residents with higher education in relation to the population. There are few familiar characters that originate from this city, like Lazarus Fype writer - cannot leave without mention the group spun poly of this city.
Politics.
Tend to be left primarily to the economic needs of people left a force must have priority, but no elected as mayor or deputy, did almost nothing to improve infrastructure or economic situation of citizens. For both at central and local level prevails nepotism, corruption, selfishness of the people remains the only hope that one day transition will be just the thing of the past.

Ruins (Australian band)

Ruins is an Australian black metal band, based in Hobart, Tasmania. The band was formed somewhere between 2000 and 2002 by Alex Pope, (formerly of the Sea Scouts,) and Dave Haley (The Amenta, Blood Duster and Psycroptic).
Recording.
Ruins began as a recording project, featuring Pope supplying vocals, guitar and bass, with Haley on drums. It has been incorrectly reported that Haley is merely a session player in the band, and he has publicly dismissed such views as nonsense. The band consists of two core-members used on recordings, with extra live members added for shows, similar to Norwegian black metal band, Satyricon. Initial recordings were intended for demo purposes only, but were decided later to be of sufficient quality for public use. Their first recording, "Atom and Time", was released in 2004 by Blacktalon Media.
Their debut full length album "Spun Forth as Dark Nets" was engineered by Joe Haley, Dave's brother and member of the live Ruins line-up. From the response to their recordings, Ruins decided to recruit session musicians to play live.
Live.
Joe Haley and Kai Summers joined Ruins as live session members on guitar and bass respectively. When Summers has been unavailable for shows, Tom Void has filled in. However, Summers remains the full-time live member. Ruins have toured extensively across Australia and New Zealand, supporting many well-known overseas bands including Satyricon, Celtic Frost, Immortal, Pig Destroyer and Wolves in the Throne Room. 
Current.
Their third release, "Cauldron" (2008), was repressed on limited edition vinyl by Debemur Morti Productions. "Front the Final Foes", which was released in late 2009, showcased a heavier production style, and less introspective songwriting. 
Pope contributed vocals to fellow Tasmanian Moribund Records label mates, Thrall's album, "Away from the Haunts of Men."

Gustav Wallis

Gustav Wallis (1 May 1830 – 20 June 1878) was a German plant collector, who introduced over 1,000 plant species to Europe, many of which were named after him.
Early life.
Wallis was born in Lüneburg, in Lower Saxony, Germany, where his father was an advocate. Wallis was deaf and mute until six years of age, and it was not until 1836 that he was able to talk. As a consequence, he suffered from a speech defect during his entire life. 
In about 1836 his father died, leaving his mother a widow with six children. With no means of support, she found it necessary to leave Lüneburg and move to Detmold, her native town. It was here that Wallis attended school and, in the surrounding mountains and forests, developed the love of nature and botany which later gave him the desire to travel abroad and visit the tropics. As a youth, Wallis had great energy and an indomitable will, and despite his speech impediment he acquired considerable proficiency in foreign languages, an accomplishment which stood him in good stead during the course of his career. 
At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to a goldsmith but, disliking the work, he quit and took an apprenticeship with a gardener at Detmold. At the end of his apprenticeship, he obtained employment in Munich, from where he often visited the Alps to collect and study plants.
In 1856, Wallis went to southern Brazil, where he set up a horticultural establishment for a German firm but, following the bankruptcy of the parent company, the branch was forced to close and Wallis was left practically penniless.
Jean Linden.
In 1858, he was engaged as a plant-collector by Jean Linden’s orchid company, "L’Horticulture Internationale", of Brussels. Wallis then began a hazardous journey, crossing the continent of South America, starting at the mouth of the River Amazon and traversing the total length to its source, exploring the river and many of its more important tributaries. 
In 1866, Wallis was exploring the low-lying areas where the Rio Negro meets the Amazon, when he came across an unknown "Cattleya" species growing among the branches of macucus trees. Wallis was able to send a large shipment to Linden, who named the new species "Cattleya eldorado", and the following year had more than 700 plants of the new species in bloom on display in Paris.
James Veitch & Sons.
In 1870, he was engaged by James Veitch & Sons, of Chelsea, London who sent him to the Philippines to search for orchids of the "Phalaenopsis" species which were indigenous to those islands. Although he was able to make sufficient finds to send a shipment back to England, including "Paphiopedilum argus", "P. haynaldianum", "Dendrobium amethystoglossum" and "Lilium philippinense", the mission proved too expensive to be considered a success and Wallis had to be recalled. 
In December 1872, he was sent to Colombia, where he had explored previously, returning in 1874 with many finds, including two giant-leaved "Anthuriums", "A. veitchii" and "A. warocqueanum", as well as several interesting and valuable orchids, including various species of "Masdevallia".
Later career and death.
His contract with Veitch was terminated in 1874, but he continued to collect plants in South America at his own expense, commencing his last journey at the end of the summer of 1875, when he left to explore the northern and central regions of the continent. Whilst in Colombia, he discovered "Zamia wallisii" but his samples were lost; it was only in the 1980s that the plant was re-located.
He was next heard of in Panama, dangerously ill with yellow fever and malaria. He recovered from his illness and was able to re-commence work, but his second attack, combined with dysentery, proved fatal. His last letter was dated Cuenca, Ecuador, 24 March 1878, where, according to the collector Edward Klaboch, Wallis died in hospital on 20 June.
Honours.
Amongst the plants named after Wallis are:

Rodney Orpheus

Rodney Orpheus is a Northern Irish musician, record producer, writer, lecturer, and a leading member of the Thelemic organization Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). He is known for his work with the musical group The Cassandra Complex and for his book on the magick of Aleister Crowley, "Abrahadabra".
Early life.
Rodney Orpheus was born William Rodney Campbell on 8 July 1960 in Moneymore, Northern Ireland, and attended Rainey Endowed School on a scholarship. He became interested in music during the punk rock movement of the late 70s and led one of Ireland's first experimental punk bands, The Spare Mentals. In 1980 he migrated to Leeds, England where he formed The Cassandra Complex with Paul Dillon in 1984. The two, who met when Orpheus gatecrashed Dillon's 21st birthday party, originally financed the band by working at The Sorcerer's Apprentice occult store.
After the release of The Cassandra Complex's first records Orpheus spent several years touring Europe, and while living in Aachen, Germany he joined Ordo Templi Orientis. Orpheus had studied the works of Aleister Crowley and other occult writers since his teenage years, and had previously founded and edited the UK occult newspaper "Pagan News" along with writer Phil Hine.
While in Aachen he began work on the book "Abrahadabra", published by Looking Glass Press in Sweden and later republished by Weiser Books. The "Ashe Journal" described the book as "a significant contribution to the field of Thelemic, or Crowleyan if you will, magick," and the "Tree of Light" journal said it was "one of the very few competent and readable introductory texts to Thelemic magick."
Hamburg.
Orpheus moved to Hamburg, Germany in 1990 where he formed the Makhashanah Oasis (later Lodge) of O.T.O. During this period he also formed the band Sun God, based on Santería initiation he had received from Baba Raul Canizares on a visit to New York and inspired by the work of Vodou artist Sallie Ann Glassman. He set up a recording studio where The Cassandra Complex recorded their next albums, as well as producing and remixing several records for other German alternative artists, including Die Krupps and Girls Under Glass. Orpheus had a role in the German vampire movie "Kiss My Blood", and toured with The Sisters of Mercy. He was described as a "technopagan" in Mark Dery's 1996 overview of cyberculture "Escape Velocity":
To Rodney Orpheus the ease with which such metaphors are turned upside down underscores his belief that there's nothing oxymoronic about the term "technopagan" in end-of-the-century cyberculture. "People say 'pagans sit in the forest worshipping nature; what are you doing drinking diet coke on front of a Macintosh?' " says Orpheus, who in addition to being a card-carrying Crowleyite is a hacker and a mind machine aficionado. "But when you use a computer, you're using your imagination to manipulate the computer's reality. Well, that's "exactly" what sorcery is all about - changing the plastic quality of nature on a nuts-and-bolts level. And that's why magickal techniques dating back hundreds of years are totally valid in a cyberpunk age."
Los Angeles.
Orpheus had used Steinberg's computer music software in the studio for some time, and soon after moving to Hamburg he joined the company to pioneer their Internet Services division. He became a well-known figure presenting the company's software at trade shows, and in 1999 relocated to Los Angeles, California, to design one of the first Web 2.0 community sites, Cubase.net. While based in L.A., Orpheus served as a member of the US Grand Lodge O.T.O. Supreme Grand Council. He was still writing literature as well as music during this period: his horror short story "Gothic Blood Dream" and his poem "Poison Butterflies" would be published in the "Gothic II" anthology in 2002.
Return to the UK.
In Los Angeles Orpheus spent time working within the movie sound industry and became a strong supporter of surround sound. This led to him moving to Henley-on-Thames and becoming Business Development Manager for the DTS Entertainment surround record label in 2004. During this period he produced the surround albums "Planet Earth" for LTJ Bukem and "A Gigantic Globular Burst of Anti-Static" for The Future Sound of London.
In 2007 he reformed the original line-up of The Cassandra Complex.
Orpheus has always been fascinated by games, and has written supplements for the tabletop game "Car Wars" from Steve Jackson Games. During a long period of recuperation after an operation in 2001 he started designing modules for the computer game "Neverwinter Nights", eventually running an online server called "The Hidden Tradition" and winning a Neverwinter Vault Hall of Fame award. This led him to spend time lecturing in games design at South Gloucestershire and Stroud College in Gloucestershire from 2008–2010.
Current work.
Rodney Orpheus was appointed Deputy National Grand Master General for UK Grand Lodge of O.T.O.. at the Spring equinox 2009, and appeared on the O.T.O. podcast "Thelema NOW!" in September of that year; where he would make a second appearance in the August 2011 edition.
He appeared with Nick Margerrison on Kerrang Radio representing O.T.O. in May 2009:
We're chatting to a bloke, Rodney Orpheus, who is part of the religion which Crowley left behind after he died, it's called O.T.O. I'm asking him what would happen if we were to play out Crowley's magical spell ritual designed to call out demons. He tells me probably nothing, "if demons were to come out of the radio I'd be very surprised, if they're going to come out of anywhere, they'll come out of people's heads". Awesome. Great bit of radio. Hit play on the song. Two minutes in the station has a major technical glitch. The consoles in all three studios stop working. The mic won't turn on and then won't turn off. We play three songs in a row as we try to sort it out. Chaos as broadcast assistants and producers run about like headless chickens trying to sort it out. Technical response team on the phone. Finally we're back on air. Not the most impressive bit of radio ever. An example of Crowley's curse?
His most recent book on magick, "Grimoire of Aleister Crowley", was published by Abrahadabra Press in August 2011. It has been described as "a truly exceptional modern grimoire" by magical scholar and editor Colin Campbell.

Allendale Columbia School

Allendale Columbia School is an independent, nonsectarian, college preparatory school for students in nursery through twelfth grade. The Columbia School for girls, established in 1890 by Caroline Milliman and Alida Lattimore, and the Allendale School for boys, established in 1926 by a group of Rochester businessmen, merged in 1972 to form the current coeducational school. Allendale Columbia serves Rochester, New York and the surrounding areas.
Faculty.
Allendale Columbia has fifty-four teachers. Thirty-nine of the faculty hold advanced degrees with an average teaching experience of 18 years.
Campus.
Allendale Columbia School is located on in Pittsford, NY. The school is separated into three divisions: Lower School, Middle School, and Upper School. While these divisions each have their own area on campus, they share many areas including a 500 seat performance center, library, dining commons, athletic, music, and arts facilities. The students change buildings for various classes and utilize the entire campus throughout their day.
The main buildings house 41 classrooms; five science labs; nine computer labs (three classroom and six mobile); three music classrooms; two art studios, a darkroom, and a digital photography lab; a foreign language lab; a library; a performance center; two gymnasiums; and a science wing.
In 2012, the school opened a residence for international students. The home, located southeast of the campus on Allens Creek Road, accommodates up to 10 students and a full-time Dean of International Programs.
Athletics.
Allendale Columbia School is merged with The Harley School for the purpose of interscholastic sports competition in grades 7 through 12. The two schools began coordinating their athletic programs during the 1972-1973 school year. The joint program is referred to as Harley Allendale Columbia (HAC) and originally competed as the Harley Allendale-Columbia Braves. In 1997, students of both schools voted to change the team name from the Braves to the Wolves. Team supporters are known as the Wolfpack. Their tennis team is the strongest part of their sports program—it received seventh place at the national high school tournament in California despite the small size of their schools.
The HAC enforces a “no-cut” Athletic Program, and Varsity spots are guaranteed at any committed seniors.
The Harley/Allendale Columbia coordination exists to enhance the interscholastic athletic program of both schools by combining student bodies, resources, as well as faculty for coaching purposes.
The school has had success in the Finger-Lakes West Division, including recent sectional titles in Boys and Girls Tennis, Boys and Girls Soccer, and Boys and Girls Basketball.

<doc id="20040670" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20040670" title="Reinald Oudinot">
Reinald Oudinot

Reinald Oudinot (1747 – 11 February 1807) was born in Serpignes, near Verdun, France in 1747, and became a military Engineer in the French Army, rising to the rank of Brigadier. 
For some years there had been considerable cooperation between France and Portugal and in he arrived in Northern Portugal, where he was commissioned to design or assist in the repair and restoration of a number of architectural and engineering projects.
Evidence shows that he married Dª Vicencia do Carmo (Oudinot) and had a family in Portugal, as the name still exists today, and that his daughter (or one of his daughters ) married a Portuguese Military Engineer whose name was Luís Gomes de Carvalho (1771–1826). 
He alone, and then with his son in law, worked mainly in the Porto and Aveiro area and they are credited with a number of important works.
Together, their most important works were the improvements to the entry of the harbour at Leixões where Oudinot worked from 1789 to 1802 and Gomes de Carvalho continued until 1826, and the linking of the Vouga River directly to the sea at Aveiro which began in 1802.
These were extensive engineering concerns carried out during the golden age of canal building in Northern Europe. 
The objective of the work at Leixões was to provide a safer harbour than that offered by the hazardous mouth of the River Douro, in an effort to help export Port wine and other products from the Douro Valley. The foreign community in Porto involved in trade was already strong enough to have a substantial presence and need of such an infrastructure.
Incredibly, this project was only really finished at the beginning of the 1900s, (by French contractors) and indeed the Port of Leixões continues even today to be subject to improvements and alterations.
One is not sure if Oudinot and his son in law were the first to be asked to tackle this matter, or whether they are just part of a chain of professionals who worked on the project.
Together with his son in law, Oudinot was asked by the Marquês do Pombal to resolve the problem of flooding in the city of Aveiro where a storm in 1575 had blocked the original exit of the Vouga River to the sea, causing the city to be semi-flooded much of the year. They developed a project for a canal which was not fully built when Oudinot left Aveiro, and it was his son in law who finished the works.
In addition to these works, Oudinot is also credited with the design of a number of buildings in the Porto Area. These include military barracks at São Ouvido, the gateway to the castle of São João Baptista da Foz, and a building for Casa Pia, in Porto and the town hall in Póvoa de Varzim. These are all dated between 1790 and 1792.
However, on the Aveiro project it would appear that Oudinot and his son in law fell out, presumably for professional reasons, and they stopped working together. Gomes de Carvalho is thus mainly credited as the final author of the project for the drainage of the city, finished in 1808 although he was to be expelled from the city later on.
On 9 October 1803, there were severe storms on the island of Madeira which caused severe flash floods to rush down the valleys that traverse the City of Funchal (and other towns and villages on the island), causing massive destruction and the loss of between 600 and 1000 lives. 
Oudinot was sent to Funchal by the Portuguese government on 19 February 1804 to make sure it didn't happen again. He was also sent to improve the port of Funchal which at that time still had no link to the “loo rock”.
He it was who apparently designed the massive walls that side the 4 or 5 streams and rivers that flow through the centre of Funchal and split the city into several distinct sections. It maybe that similar works in Ribeira Grande and other towns and villages in Madeira were either designed by him, or copied from his work in Funchal. 
He also set up the structure for a full survey, firstly of Funchal and its bay which he sent to the Visconde de Anadia in 1805, and subsequently of all Madeira which later completed by Paulo Dias de Almeida.
However his stay in Madeira was brief as died there on 11 February 1807. This is almost coincidental with the second British occupation of Madeira at the end of 1807, at the outbreak of the Peninsular War. Had he lived longer, his French nationality could well have been embarrassing on the island. His widow, Dª Vicencia stayed on in Madeira.
Despite this, his work must have had a great impact on the island, because although he was only there for only three years, one of the main streets, institutions and several buildings bear his name throughout Funchal. He is also remembered in street, canal and park names in Aveiro.

You're Not Sorry

"You're Not Sorry" is a country pop song performed by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was solely written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift's aid. It was released on October 28, 2008 by Big Machine Records as a promotional single from Swift's second studio album, "Fearless" on iTunes, though it is no longer available. A remix version for the television episode of "" that Swift made an appearance in was later released. Swift wrote "You're Not Sorry", inspired by an ex-boyfriend who was revealed to be opposite of what he appeared to be. The song is a power ballad with country and rock music influences.
Contemporary critics gave "You're Not Sorry" average to favorable reviews. In North America, the song achieved commercial success. It peaked at number 11 on Canadian Hot 100. In the United States, "You're Not Sorry" also peaked at number 11 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and was certified gold by the RIAA. Swift performed the song in several venues, including on her first headlining tour, the 2009 and 2010 Fearless Tour. During the tour, Swift performed a mashup of a cover version of Justin Timberlake's "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around" and "You're Not Sorry".
Background.
"You're Not Sorry" was written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. It was inspired by an ex-boyfriend who was later revealed to be opposite of what Swift had originally thought. Swift recalled that, at first, "He came across as prince charming." As the relationship continued, Swift was informed of numerous secrets about her boyfriend she was not aware of. "And one by one, I would figure them out. I would find out who he really was," she said. She wrote "You're Not Sorry" in an emotional state, which she described as "the breaking point", where she thought to herself, "'You know what? Don’t even think that you can keep on hurting me.'" The circumstances reached a point where she felt she had to walk away. "You're Not Sorry" was first released as a promotional single from "Fearless" on October 28, 2008 as part of Countdown to "Fearless", an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store. The song was reissued on March 5, 2009, as remix, the same day she made her guest appearance on the television series "" in the episode "Turn, Turn, Turn". The remix was featured in the episode.
Composition.
"You're Not Sorry" is a country pop song with a length lasting four minutes and 21 seconds. Todd Martens of "The Los Angeles Times" felt the track was an old-fashioned power ballad, rather than country. Jordan Levin of "The Miami Herald" agreed and described its genre as a "rebellious rock tune." The song is set in common time and has a slow tempo of 67.5 beats per minute. It is written in the key of E♭ minor and Swift's vocals span two octaves, from G♭3 to C♭5. The musical arrangement contains a prominent hook during its chorus, according to Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine. "You're Not Sorry" commences with piano and, mid-song, progresses toward backing electric guitars, which eventually reach a solo. Martens believed Swift's vocals were not the strongest because the existence of the electric guitar solo was meant to prevent too many high notes. It follows the chord progression E♭m–C♭–G♭–D♭. Rob Sheffield of "Blender" magazine noted the lyrics to "You're Not Sorry" had many "tingling pheromones".
Critical reception.
Contemporary critics reviewed "You're Not Sorry" in a majority of favorable tones. Rob Sheffield of "Blender" magazine received "You're Not Sorry" negatively and used the word "drippy" to describe it. Sheffield added that, in the song, by comparison, "she reminds you what a smart job she normally does of keeping the tempo jumping." Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine believed "You're Not Sorry" was one of the songs on "Fearless" that expanded on the success of Swift's eponymous debut album, "Taylor Swift" (2006), because of how prominently its hook stands out. Craig Rosen of "The Hollywood Reporter" said "You're Not Sorry" was ostentatious in regards to Swift's crossover potential. Nick Catucci of "New York" magazine read an article posted in "The New York Times", which stated Swift "quickly established herself as the most remarkable country music breakthrough artist of the decade", and opted his own opinion, based on the song. Catucci said, "And indeed, we think we got a little fairy dust in our eyes listening to 'You're Not Sorry' [... It] isn't the stuff of redneck women but earnest suburban princesses," despite that he had listened to better songs in the past decade. Scott Mervis of "The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" compared "You're Not Sorry" to a "chanteuse a la Tori Amos".
Chart performance.
As it was not released as a double-single, "You're Not Sorry" did not receive airplay, thus its chart appearances consisted mainly of digital downloads. The song entered "Billboard"'s Hot Digital Songs Chart at number two, which led to an appearance on the "Billboard" Hot 100 on the week ending November 15, 2008. "You're Not Sorry" debuted and peaked at number 11 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming the week's top debut and narrowly missing Swift's top ten debut of 2008. In the succeeding week, the song descended to number 35 and then fell off the chart. Upon the release of the CSI remix, it re-entered the "Billboard" Hot 100 at number 67. "You're Not Sorry" is one of 13 songs from "Fearless" charted within the top 40 of the "Billboard" Hot 100, breaking the record for the most top 40 entries from a single album. "You're Not Sorry" spent a total of five weeks on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Also in the United States, "You're Not Sorry" peaked at number 21 on the now-defunct Pop 100 Chart. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for the shipment of 500,000 units. The song debuted and peaked at number 11 on the Canadian Hot 100. As of December 2011, "You're Not Sorry" has sold 653,000 copies in the USA.
Live performances.
Swift performed "You're Not Sorry" on all venues of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which extended from April 2009 to June 2010. During each performance, Swift donned a black cocktail dress with sparkly ornaments along the stomach. She begun the performance by sitting on a bench, playing black grand piano. Midway through "You're Not Sorry", Swift ceases playing the piano and commences to sing a cover version of Justin Timberlake's "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around" while whipping her hair, maintaining on the bench. Throughout the remainder of the performance, she intermingled between the two songs as smoke swirled and lightning was projected on the stage. Jon Pareles of "The New York Times" referred to the performance as one of the night's highlights at the August 27, 2009, concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Reed Fischer of "Miami New Times" attended the March 7, 2010, concert at BankAtlantic Center in Sunrise, Florida and, of the cover of "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around", said, "That, and some extended beating on an oil drum sculpture, made for the only unsavory moments of the night." Alice Fisher of the United Kingdom magazine "The Observer" believed the performance at the May 7, 2009, concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London, England "was undermined by the way Swift writhed on her stool and awkwardly thumped the piano lid in one of the most unconvincing displays of passion I've seen since "Footballers' Wives" finished." Swift also performed the song at an exclusive performance, hosted by 95.8 Capital FM, the 2009 Academy of Country Music Awards, and the 2009 CMA Music Festival. During her Speak Now World Tour, she used elements of "You're Not Sorry" and "Apologize" while performing "Back To December". She also performed the song twice on the Red Tour.

Development and design.
The Type 4 rocket mortar was developed in the final stages of World War II by the Imperial Japanese Army Technical Bureau, as a relatively low-cost, easy to produce weapon, which had an advantage of greater accuracy over conventional mortars in that it fired a spin-stabilized projectile. The first units were deployed in 1943, and were used in limited numbers in combat during the Battle of Iwo Jima and Battle of Okinawa. Due to its ease of construction, it was produced in limited numbers and distributed to hidden arsenals for use as last-ditch weapons during the projected Allied invasion of the Japanese home islands.
Unlike the Type 4 20 cm Rocket, which could be launched from an ordinary pipe or culvert with sufficient diameter, wooden rails, or even directly from a slope in the ground, the Type 4 40cm rocket required specially designed launch rails.

Enterprise (1855)

The Enterprise was an early steamboat operating on the Willamette River in Oregon and also one of the first to operate on the Fraser River in British Columbia. This vessel should not be confused with the many other vessels, some of similar design, also named "Enterprise". In earlier times, this vessel was sometimes called "Tom Wright's Enterprise" after one of her captains, the famous Tom Wright.
Construction.
"Enterprise" was built at Canemah, Oregon in the fall of 1855 by Capt. Archibald Jamieson, Captain A.S. Murray, Amory Holbrook and John Torrence, in the fall of 1855, for the upper Willamette trade. Her officers on the first trip upriver to Corvallis (then known as Marysville) were: Jamieson, captain ; Chandler, purser; and Torrence, engineer. George A. Pease was afterward employed as pilot, and John Marshall, engineer.
Operations on the Willamette River.
From 1855 to 1858 "Enterprise" was operated on the Willamette River, running between Oregon City, Canemah, and Corvallis. At that time Corvallis was considered to be the head of navigation on the Willamette. Merchants above Corvallis tried to get Captain Jamieson to bring "Enterprise", which he then commanded, above Corvallis, but he would not go farther than Orleans, then a small settlement on the east side of the river across from Corvallis.
Transfer to British Columbia.
In July 1858, Jamieson sold "Enterprise" to Capt. Thomas A. Wright. Jamieson used the money from the sale of "Enterprise" to build the steamer "Onward". Tom Wright became one of the most famous steamboat captains in the Pacific Northwest. Like Jamieson, Wright was one of a family in the steamboat business. His father was Capt. John T. Wright, who was the owner of other steamboats, such as "Sea Bird" and "Commodore". The other two sons, also steamboat captains, were George S. Wright and John T. Wright, Jr.
Tom Wright's plan for "Enterprise" was to take the vessel into British waters to serve the Fraser River Gold Rush. The first part of the journey began by moving "Enterprise" from the upper to the lower Willamette River by lining the vessel over Willamette Falls. These falls could not be navigated by steamboats, and indeed Captain Jamieson was later killed when a vessel under his command was accidentally swept over them and destroyed. "Lining" was procedure where a heavy cable was attached to the vessel, and then to a well-anchored windlass on shore. Little by little the cable would be let out to allow the vessel to gradually pass over the falls to the lower river. 
Wright then took "Enterprise" down the lower Willamette and Columbia rivers to Astoria, Oregon. Once there, Wright arranged for an ocean-going steamship to tow "Enterprise" to Victoria, British Columbia. Victoria, then the largest settlement on the Pacific Coast of North America north of San Francisco. "Enterprise" left Astoria under tow, but the strong waves on the Columbia Bar caused "Enterprise" to be so terribly racked that the vessel began leaking, and it was only by luck that they got "Enterprise" back into shallow water at Astoria before she sank. She was raised and repaired, and started again in August for Victoria, again under tow.
Operations in British Columbia.
"Enterprise" arrived in Victoria in the middle of August 1858. 'Other steamboats that arrived at Victoria at almost the same time that summer were "Wilson G. Hunt", "Martin White", and "Maria". 
"Enterprise" with other American steamboats obtained a license from the governor of British Columbia to operate in British territory. "Enterprise" was the second steam-powered vessel to operate on the Fraser River, and had been brought up to Victoria in July 1858. The first vessel was another American steamer, the "Umatilla" ex "Fashion" from the Columbia River. "Enterprise" was very successful on the Fraser River, earning $25,000 in one trip up to Murderer's Bar, near Fort Hope, BC. 25,000 miners went into the Fraser diggings in the summer of 1858, but by the winter only 3,000 remained.
With the drop in the population of miners, by the fall of 1858, "Enterprise" was one of only two steamboats operating on the Fraser River, the other being "Maria", under Capt. William A. Lubbock. For a time at least, the two boats divided the traffic between them, with "Maria" running upriver from Fort Langley to Fort Hope and other points, and "Enterprise" running between Fort Langley and Victoria, on Vancouver Island. With a monopoly on transport, the two boats were able to raise freight rates from $4 to $7 per ton in the summer to $60 a ton. Beans that cost 3 cents a pound in Victoria cost 75 cents in Lytton, British Columbia. 
On December 9, 1858, "Enterprise" was caught in the ice on the Fraser River between Fort Hope and Fort Langley. The vessel was short on food and accommodations, and so 114 of the passengers decided to leave the steamer and walk the remaining distance to Fort Langley. In the cold weather, this proved a mistake, as they had inadequate clothing and insufficient clothing and camping provisions to make the journey. After three days in the ice, Captain Wright was able to hack the "Enterprise" free. He then cruised up and down the river, eventually rescuing all of the passengers, many of whom were suffering from frostbite.
"Enterprise" built for the Willamette River was not strong enough to regularly cross the often stormy Strait of Georgia, which was the body of water that separated Vancouver Island from the mouth of the Fraser River on the mainland. The Wrights however had no choice in the matter if they were to remain in business, because the vessel they had been running on the route, the "Sea Bird" was destroyed by fire in the Strait of Georgia on September 7, 1858 while en route from Victoria to Fort Langley. By the spring of 1859, Capt. John T. Wright was able to replace "Sea Bird" by purchasing an interest in the sidewheeler "Eliza Anderson", and arranging to have the "Anderson" brought from Portland, Oregon where she had been recently built, to Victoria, BC, where she arrived in late March, 1859. This allowed the Wrights to run the heavier more durable Anderson across the Straits to Fort Langley, while returning "Enterprise" to the 'Fraser River to make the run up from Fort Langley.
On March 30, 1859, with Captain Tom Wright in command, "Enterprise" set out upriver from Fort Langley (after meeting the "Anderson"). The river was rising high with the rapidly melting snowfall, and with a new boiler installed in the "Enterprise" Captain Wright hoped to take the vessel all the way to Fort Yale. Only one other steamboat had ever made it to Fort Yale, the "Umatilla" which by then was no longer on the Fraser River. This time, Captain Wright was unable to go further up than Fort Hope. "Enterprise" was not powerful enough to beat the strong currents forming whirlpools in the river. Another constant hazard were logs caught in the river bottom, forming "snags" which could damage or destroy a steam vessel.
Failed transfer to Chehalis River.
To command a steamboat at a time when there were neither roads nor railroads in the Pacific Northwest was to be in a spectacular opportunity to earn money. Tom Wright never became rich because he could never settle down to running a vessel on a particular route for a sustained period of time. As soon as he mastered one route, he would be looking for another one. In June 1859 Captain Wright was ready to make another change. Hearing of homesteading activity beginning in the valley of the Chehalis River, in the western part of what is now Washington, Wright determined to take "Enterprise" to the Chehalis. This would require the lightly built "Enterprise" to be towed, in this case by the "Eliza Anderson" west through the Strait of Juan de Fuca and then south down the coast line of the Pacific Ocean to Grays Harbor. 
The Chehalis River flows into Grays Harbor on its eastern shore, near where the modern cities of Aberdeen and Hoquiam, Washington are now located. Wright begin this journey from Victoria on July 8, 1859 with "Eliza Anderson" towing "Enterprise". In the Strait of Juan de Fuca "Enterprise" broke a shaft on her sternwheel, and the entire expedition was forced to turn back to Esquimalt, where "Enterprise" had to wait for a replacement shaft to be brought in from San Francisco.
Run to San Juan Islands.
"Enterprise" was repaired by the end of July 1859, and by that time there was a demand for steamers to carry troops to the San Juan Islands. At that time the boundary between the United States and British Columbia was in dispute, with both countries claiming the San Juan Islands. British and American garrisons were established on San Juan Island. At one point a soldier shot a pig belonging to a partisan of the opposing country, and as a result the otherwise bloodless standoff became known as the Pig War. Steamboats in the area received contracts from both countries to move troops and supplies to the islands in connection with the dispute. Once "Enterprise" was repaired, Tom Wright postponed his plans to move the vessel to the Chehalis to take advantage of the increase in business, making a run on August 1, 1859 from Victoria to San Juan Island carrying passengers.
Completed transfer to Chehalis River.
Following the San Juan Island trip, Tom Wright was finally able to get "Enterprise" around Cape Flattery and south to Grays Harbor and the Chehalis River. Wright's plan had been to earn huge freight rates and passenger fares from what he had thought would be the booming population in the Chehalis valley, Wright worked "Enterprise" to the head of navigation on the Chehalis, sinking three times on the way. When he finally arrived at the headwaters, Wright found not a booming population ready to pay lots of money for steamboat service, but only five farmers who offered to sell Wright a few eggs, butter and vegetables for fifty dollars. Disgusted with the situation, Wright tied up the "Enterprise" and returned to Puget Sound.
By the spring of 1860, Wright was able to arrange a government contract to transport troops down the Chehalis River to Grays Harbor, and so was able to recoup some of his losses. Once the government contract work expired, there was no further business in the Grays Harbor area. Unable to move the lightly built vessel again on the open ocean, Wright dismantled "Enterprise" at Grays Harbor, with the machinery being shipped to China.

Tractatus de Purgatorio Sancti Patricii

Tractatus de Purgatorio Sancti Patricii ("Treatise on Saint Patrick's Purgatory") is a Latin text authored in c. 1180-84 by a monk who identifies himself as H. of Saltrey. The author is traditionally known as Henry, and was a Cistercian in Huntingdonshire.
Date and provenance.
The "Tractatus" relates the journey of an Irish knight, Owein (a version of the Irish name "Eoghan"), to St Patrick's Purgatory in Loch Derg where he journeys through Purgatory and the Earthly Paradise. Owein's journey is dated by Henry of Saltrey to the reign of King Stephen of England between 1135 and 1154. Henry states that his source was Gilbert, a monk in Lincoln who visited Ireland in 1148 to found a monastery at Baltinglass. Since Gilbert spoke no Irish he was introduced to the knight Owein who became his interpreter during his two year stay in Ireland.
The Text.
The "Tractatus" is dedicated to Abbot Hugh of Sartris. The introductory section is composed of six parts, a theological survey of the otherworld, an account of Irish scepticism of Saint Patrick's teaching, an example given by Gilbert of the savagery of the Irish, how Christ revealed Saint Patrick's Purgatory to Patrick, an account of a saintly former prior at the Purgatory, and the rituals practiced by the pilgrims who came there. 
The narrative of Owein's visit begins with an account of how the knight was moved to make reparation for his sins after attending confession. On entering the cave he made his way to a great field in which was a hall which resembled a cloister. There he was greeted by fifteen men who appeared to be monks and were dressed entirely in white. Their prior gave Owein advice on how he should complete his journey safely, by calling on the name of Jesus Christ if ever he found himself in difficulty. Shortly after the men had departed Owein heard a great roar and a vast number of demons rushed towards him. These demons bind Owein and throw him into a fire, but he is delivered when he calls on Christ. 
Owein journeys across a series of plains where the souls in purgatory undergo tortures at the hand of demons. The sufferings of the souls in purgatory are described in detailed and vivid terms. The demons repeatedly try to torture Owein, but he escapes each time he utters Christ's name. Finally he comes to a great, fiery river which emits a great stench and is filled with demons. The demons reveal that beneath this river is the entrance to Hell. A narrow and slippery bridge provides the only means of traversing this river safely. When Owein calls upon the name of Jesus the bridge widens enough for him to cross comfortably. 
The account of purgatory is followed by a homily comparing the severity of purgatorial pains with the sufferings of the present world and exhorting the reader to pray for the dead. 
On the other side of the bridge lies the Earthly Paradise. Two archbishops greet Owein and take him through a land filled with flowers, singing, sweet smells and joy. Owein is told that this is a place of rest for souls who have been purified in purgatory before their entry into heaven. The archbishops take the knight to the top of a high mountain from where he can make out the gates of the celestial heaven. 
A second homily is inserted here asking the reader to always remember the happiness of the saints and the pain of the sinful. 
Owein receives some of the manna-like heavenly food which the inhabitants of both the celestial and earthly paradises enjoy. He is then told he must return to the world to live out the rest of his life. He returns by the way he came and this time the devils flee from him in terror. 
Henry concludes by relating how Gilbert met Owein and recounted his tale to Henry himself. Gilbert's also gives the testimony of a monk who was abducted by devils one night as further proof of the authenticity of Owein's story. Henry adds an account of his own researches into the story. He interviewed two Irish abbots about the purgatory and bishop Florentianus, who gives an account of a hermit living near Lough Derg who is visited by demons.
Influence.
The "Tractatus" was arguably the most popular vision of Purgatory throughout the Middle Ages and survives in over 30 versions in almost every European vernacular. More than 150 manuscripts of the Latin text are extant. It was read and adapted long after several ideas feature prominently in it fell out of mainstream belief (e.g. the idea of the earthly paradise as an afterlife location where souls would spend time between their period in purgatory and their entry into heaven). 
Among the most famous versions of the "Tractatus" is the Anglo-Norman translation the "Legend of the Purgatory of St. Patrick" by Marie de France. The Auchinleck manuscript preserves a version in Middle English verse. The story was almost certainly known to Dante. 
In its themes, Irish background, and breadth of influence, it is comparable to the Visio Tnugdali. The two texts are nearly contemporary and frequently appear in the same manuscripts. Like the Visio Tnugdali, the "Tractatus" was instrumental in shaping popular ideas of the Otherworld.

IRSA

IRSA (Institute for Art Historical Research) primarily operates as a publishing house in the field of scholarly art historical texts. It is the publisher of the international periodical "Artibus et Historiae"; however, it also publishes important volumes by eminent scholars through its Bibliotheca Artibus et Historiae. Among its publications are exhibition catalogues, artists’ biographies and autobiographies, and even a book of poetry. 
In addition to publishing scholarly texts, IRSA organizes research work and exhibitions of historical and contemporary art, to which it supplements catalogues. 
Within the framework of its activities, IRSA collaborates with both universities and museums worldwide.
History.
Established in 1979 by the Polish art historian Józef Grabski, the Institute was initially based in Venice (1979–1982) and hence the acronym IRSA, "Istituto per le Ricerche di Storia dell’Arte". From there it moved to Florence and Vienna, and finally in 1996 to Cracow, Poland.
Dr. Grabski’s initiative to create a new art periodical as the main activity of the institute was the result of what was observed as a lack of an independent and, significantly, interdisciplinary journal dedicated to art history. His idea came to fruition with a group of art historians gathered after the International Congress of the History of Art (CIHA) in Bologna in 1979 and IRSA as an Institute and as a publisher came into being. That same year (but already dated 1980) the first issue of "Artibus et Historiae" appeared. Since that time the periodical has appeared in uninterrupted sequence on a semi-annual basis.

Norwegian Support Committee for Chechnya

The Norwegian Support Committee for Chechnya () is a Norwegian advocacy group.
Organization.
Non-partisan, its purpose is to "work for immediate, total and unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces Chechnya and for the right of the Chechen people to autonomy". In addition it works to spread information about the situation in Chechnya, to help organize developmental support within Chechnya, and to assist Chechen refugees in Norway and other countries.
Its board of directors are chaired by Hilde Jørgensen. Members of the board include former national legislator Ingvald Godal and the Norwegian PEN chairman Kjell Olaf Jensen.
Attention.
The committee has played a somewhat controversial role in Norwegian politics. Following the Moscow theater hostage crisis in October 2002, Ingvald Godal said of the terrorists that "I understand their action, even though I do not defend it". He later claimed that he failedly attempted to enlist Norway as a negotiator during the crisis. In November the same year, ahead of a state visit by Vladimir Putin in Norway, Ingvald Godal filed a prosecution request to the Police of Norway. He also suggested that the Prime Minister of Norway take initiative to an international criminal tribunal for Chechnya. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that a police prosecution of a foreign head of state is not possible, and rebuffed the latter proposal. During Putin's visit, the committee held a demonstration together with Amnesty International, the Norwegian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and Norwegian Church Aid. The committee has engaged in other peaceful protests, such as a 2007 memorial of Anna Politkovskaya in cooperation with the Helsinki Committee, the Norwegian PEN, the Human Rights House, the Norwegian Union of Journalists and Nobel Peace Center.
In 2004 the committee and the Socialist Left Party of Norway invited Ahmed Zakayev, an accused terrorist exiled in the United Kingdom, to visit Norway. The Norwegian ambassador to Russia Øyvind Nordsletten received a letter from the Solicitor General of Russia, who called the visit "blasphemous" and demanded extradition. Another visit to Norway by Zakayev followed in December 2004. As a result, counsellor Paul G. Larsen at the Embassy of Norway in Moscow was summoned to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in what journalist Carsten Thomassen described as a "forceful diplomatic reaction".

Best Dressed Chicken in Town

Best Dressed Chicken in Town is the debut album by Jamaican deejay Dr. Alimantado. It was first released in 1978, and collects many of his self-produced singles from 1972 to 1977, employing the engineering talents of Lee "Scratch" Perry, King Tubby, and Scientist. It was the first album released by Greensleeves Records, and found favour with followers of both reggae and punk rock in the United Kingdom. The album employed several major hits as the basis for the tracks, including Horace Andy's versions of "Ain't No Sunshine" (on the title track) and "A Quiet Place" ("Poison Flour" and "I Shall Fear No Evil"), John Holt's "Ali Baba" ("I Killed the Barber"), and Gregory Isaacs' "Thief a Man" (on "Gimmie Mi Gun") and "My Religion" ("Unitone Skank"). The album was described by "The Independent" as "one of the finest albums from reggae's golden age".
Release history.
The album was originally issued in 1978 on Greensleeves and on the Barclay label. The album was reissued on Alimantado's own "Keyman" label on vinyl and CD in 1987, with extra tracks from that era, and reissued in 2001 by Greensleeves as part of their reissue programme of classic albums. In 2007 the album was reissued again to mark Greensleeves' 30th anniversary.

Solomon and Marcolf

Solomon and Marcolf is a medieval tale, or romance, describing the adventures and conversations of Solomon and Marcolf, or Marolf. The adventures have some connection with those of Ashmedai, while the conversations consist chiefly of riddles similar to those put to Solomon by the Queen of Sheba. The exact extent of its indebtedness to the Haggadah is somewhat doubtful, though it is practically certain that the various versions are derived from an Eastern original.
The earliest known versions of the tale are the Old English versions commonly referred to as Solomon and Saturn, first published by J. N. Kemble in 1848, for the Ælfric Society. Latin versions of it were often appended to the "Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum". Both Hans Folz and Hans Sachs made use of the legend. A French version was made by Pierre Mauclerc, Count of Brittany, in the thirteenth century.
In Italian, Julio Cæsare Croce adopted it in his "Bertholdo", another name for Marcolf. This was developed into a book at Bologna in 1736. Other versions occur in the Bolognese and Venetian dialects, and in Dutch, Greek, Polish, Icelandic, and Welsh. There are two editions in English, one published by Gerard Leeu (Antwerp, 1492), and another, "Sayings or Proverbes of King Solomon, with the Answers of Marcolfus", printed by Richard Pynson in 1530, a version of the French "Dictionnaire de Salomon".

The Popular Arab Bloc (, "HaGush Ha'Amami HaAravi") was an electoral list that contested the 1949 Israeli Constituent Assembly election. The list was launched by Mapam, just three weeks before the election, in order to mobilize Israeli Arab votes. As Mapam did not allow Arabs to be members of the party, it preferred to set up a separate list for Arabs. The election campaigning was done under the supervision of the Mapam Arab Affairs Department, led by Aharon Cohen. The list obtained 2,812 votes, failing to cross the 1% electoral threshold (4,347 votes) required to win a seat.
By the time of the next elections in 1951, Mapam had allowed Arabs to gain membership, with Rostam Bastuni being elected on the party's list.

LNWR Renown Class

The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Renown Class was a class of 4-4-0 steam locomotives. They were rebuilds of F.W. Webb's 4-cylinder compounds of the Jubilee and Alfred the Great classes into 2-cylinder simple engines by George Whale, later continued by Charles Bowen-Cooke.
The first to be rebuilt was number 1918 "Renown" in 1908.
The rebuilds retained their original numbers. Unusually for the LNWR, the parent classes also had logical number series. Thus the Renowns were all numbered in the 1901–1940 series for ex-Jubilee Class and 1941–1980 for ex-Benbow class. In 1920, locomotive 1914 "Invincible" was renumbered 1257, and the number 1914 was then taken by the Claughton Class war memorial engine 1914 "Patriot".
The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) acquired 56 Renowns in 1923. The LMS allocated these numbers in the 5131–5186 series, listed according to date of rebuilding, though not all numbers were applied before withdrawals started in 1928. Meanwhile, the LMS renumbered the existing compounds into the 5110–5129 series (though some were withdrawn before numbers could be allocated, and others were allocated numbers but not applied), and converted another 14 of these, which retained their numbers, thus taking the total for the class up to 70. All were gone by 1931 and none was preserved.

Shanagolden (or 'Seanghualainn', which in Gaelic means 'Old Shoulder') is a small village located in County Limerick, Ireland. The village located on the R521 regional road between Foynes and Newcastlewest. It is situated west of the 'Golden Vale', an area of fertile agricultural land in the province of Munster. The 2006 Irish census placed the population at 292 people.
History.
The area is mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters. In 968 the King of Munster, Mahon, defeated the Norsemen of Limerick and Waterford at Sengualainn in a "red slaughter". In 1124, Turlogh O'Connor gathered a fleet together to cross the River Shannon and plundered the lands of the Uí Conaill at Foynes Island. After the defeat of the Munster Geraldines by the English, Shanagolden village was laid out during the 1580s as a plantation village.
Places of interest.
The ruins of Shanid Castle, an important Anglo-Norman stronghold, is located a short distance away from the village. The castle was possibly constructed in 1230 on land associated with the FitzGerald family which settled in the area after 1169 and was a fortress of the Knights of Glin before being burned in 1641. Known as the "Old Abbey", St. Katherine's Abbey, Monisternagalliaghduff (Manisternagalliaghduff) is a former Augustinian nunnery founded in 1298 and dissolved in 1541. One of the earliest recorded nunneries in Ireland, it is located in a valley about 2 miles east of Shanagolden. The town's history has been chronicled in a local book, written by students of the local primary school, and was published and distributed to many local shops.

Roxette (song)

"Roxette" is a song by the band Dr. Feelgood. Recorded in 1974, it was Dr. Feelgood's debut single, and appeared on their debut album, "Down by the Jetty".
"Roxette" was issued as a single in the UK in November 1974. It failed to reach the UK Singles Chart. It was written by Wilko Johnson and produced by Vic Maile. The b-side of the record was a cover of "(Get Your Kicks On) Route 66".
Later, in September 1976, a live recording of the song was issued by the band as a single, with a live recording of "Keep It Out Of Sight" on the b-side. The live recording of the track also appeared on Dr. Feelgood's 1976 live album, "Stupidity".
"Roxette" was also later included in Dr. Feelgood's 1997's compilation album, "Twenty Five Years of Dr. Feelgood".
Johnson re-recorded the song with Norman Watt-Roy for his 2013 album, "Faith and Grace", performing it live on a few occasions on Watt-Roy's tour in October 2013.

Welfreighter

The Welfreighter was a Second World War British midget submarine developed by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) for the purpose of landing and supplying agents behind enemy lines. It only saw action once and was not particularly successful.
Design.
After the success of the X class midget submarines, an attempt was made by SOE's technical division, Inter Services Research Bureau (ISRB) under the command of Lt. Colonel John Dolphin to design a submersible craft for covert missions. These would include the landing and supplying agents behind enemy lines, intelligence gathering work off hostile coastlines, and delivering explosive depth charges to enemy shipping routes. This design became the Welfreighter. It was intended that the Welfreighter could travel surfaced by night towards an enemy-held coastline, submerging as and when necessary to avoid detection. The special agents would then be disembarked and go ashore along with their equipment, stored in the special containers. The Welfreighter would then sail out to sea and submerge itself to wait until the next night. At a pre-arranged time, or upon receiving a sound signal from the landing party (made by a mechanical device) it would surface again and pick up the agents, before heading out to sea either to rendezvous with a larger surface vessel or return to base under its own power.
The initial concept was a true miniature submarine which could from a distance be mistaken for a conventional motor boat and which could hold two agents along with its crew of two men, and which could also carry up to one ton of supplies in sealed containers. The designed range was to be up to on the surface, with a range of at speeds of up to . While submerged it was to be capable of diving to a depth of and travelling up to underwater.
Design work began towards the end of 1942 with the building of a 1/4 scale model which was used for tests in an experimental tank at Vickers' plant at St. Albans. By February 1943 the tests had produced several alterations to the original design including modifications to the hull form to make it stable under tow at speeds of - .
Prototypes.
Following the model tests, permission was granted for the construction of a full size prototype at the SOE establishment known as "The Frythe" near Welwyn Garden City.
The first prototype had little resemblance to the later versions. When launched at Staines in May 1943 it permitted further tests but showed flaws in that it was not stable under tow at speeds over and lacked freeboard. A second prototype was begun in June and was tested throughout the autumn and winter.
A third prototype was begun in September 1943. Its surface range - - exceeded the specification, but at the expense of reducing the storage capacity by . Its speed was less than the specification, at maximum while surfaced, with a mere submerged. It did however perform satisfactorily when pressure tested to a depth of .
Production.
In early 1944 a specification for a final Mk III version was proposed by SOE, which eventually entered series production. The range was now specified as , with an additional using disposable tanks (which however meant a loss of the diving capability). A further could be added if part of the storage capacity was used. The accommodation had also been enlarged; as well as the two crewmen, 4 passengers could be carried on short voyages, or 3 for longer trips. The cargo capacity had also been enhanced to enable between 1.5 and 2 tons to be carried. Underwater endurance had also been augmented, the craft now being capable of supporting 6 persons for up to 40 hours submerged. Finally, surface speed had been increased to cruising speed, or maximum. Even the electric propulsion was upgraded: it could deliver 2-3 knots.
By now it was apparent that it was unlikely that the Welfreighter would be needed in Europe, therefore consideration was given to its use in the Far East. 
Due to the urgency of production it was not possible to create a dedicated factory. As had happened with the Welman submarine the year before, production was contracted out to specialised engineering firms already engaged in production of war material. In the spring of 1944 the Letchworth company of Shelvoke and Drewry Ltd. was awarded a contract to produce Welfreighters. By early September an order for up to 34 Welfreighters was placed for delivery as soon as possible after October 1. The company had no experience of ship construction, and was from the sea. Security surrounding the production of the Welfreighter was tight, and few non-vetted employees knew the truth until after the end of the war. 
Completed craft were transported at night under canvas covers to Station IX at Welwyn, where they were fitted out, the compass and periscope and secret equipment fitted. The craft were then balanced, trimmed, and pressure tested in the establishment's water tank. They were then transported onwards to Fishguard in Wales, for sea trials.
Appearance.
The Welfreighter outwardly resembled a conventional motor boat. While surfaced it was propelled by a Gardner 4LW diesel omnibus engine driving a 4-bladed propeller, while underwater propulsion was provided by two electric motors, driving a pair of small propellers. Two "masts" on the craft's foredeck housed a Barr and Stroude periscope and a magnetic compass. A dummy mast and sail could be attached to these masts to help disguise the craft as a fishing smack. The foredeck was raised up to give some headroom inside the craft, and was fitted with small square viewports.
To the rear of the main structure was a raised deck, beneath which were housed 6 high pressure air cylinders. To the rear of this area was a cargo well, fitted at the stern with a drop-down tailgate. This could house seven cylindrical drums of cargo. Carefully loaded so as to give a slight positive buoyancy, these drums could hold equipment for use by agents or saboteurs and could be floated out through the tailgate and towed ashore by agents, either swimming or using an inflatable boat.
Each Welfreighter was manned by a Sub Lieutenant RNVR as Commander, and a Naval Engine Room Artificer (ERA) or Army mechanic (REME). Up to four special agents could travel as passengers, although two would be more usual. These would commonly be Army personnel, who would be expected to assist with handling the craft while on the surface.
Service.
Europe.
Before the Welfreighter became properly operational the secret war in Europe was nearly over. In late 1944 plans were discussed to deploy the craft to the Adriatic, to assist operations in the Balkans, where SOE was involved in supporting partisans in northern Greece, Albania, and Yugoslavia.
It was also suggested that Welfreighters could be used to plant mines in the entrances to German ports, but this was dropped when it was demonstrated that a suitable charge would have to weigh over , which would be too much for the craft's buoyancy and trim.
Trained Welfreighter crews were ready for operations through the autumn of 1944, but neither Combined Operations HQ or SOE ever required anything of them.
Far East.
Two Welfreighters were shipped to Fremantle, Australia, in late 1944, to become part of the clandestine Services Reconnaissance Department (commonly known as Z Special Unit). Extensive trials were conducted, including towing trials and exercises using high powered motor launches and Motor Torpedo Boats.

Berezin integral

In mathematical physics, a Berezin integral, named after Felix Berezin, (or Grassmann integral, after Hermann Grassmann) is a way to define integration of elements of the exterior algebra (Hermann Grassmann 1844). It is called integral because it is used in physics as a sum over histories for fermions, an extension of the path integral.
Integration on an exterior algebra.
Let formula_1 be the exterior algebra of polynomials in anticommuting elements formula_2 over the field of complex numbers. (The ordering of the generators formula_3 is fixed and defines the orientation of the exterior algebra.) The Berezin integral on formula_4 is the linear functional formula_5 with the following properties:
for any formula_8 where formula_9 means the left or the right partial derivative. These properties define the integral uniquely. The formula
expresses the Fubini law. On the right-hand side, the interior integral of a monomial formula_11 is set to be formula_12 where formula_13; the integral of formula_14 vanishes. The integral with respect to formula_15 is calculated in the similar way and so on.
Change of Grassmann variables.
Let formula_16 be odd polynomials in some antisymmetric variables formula_17. The Jacobian is the matrix
where the left and the right derivatives coincide and are even polynomials. The formula for the coordinate change reads
Berezin integral.
Consider now the algebra formula_20 of functions of real commuting variables formula_21 and of anticommuting variables formula_22 (which is called the free superalgebra of dimension formula_23). This means that an element formula_24 is a function of the argument formula_25 that varies in an open set formula_26 with values in the algebra formula_27 Suppose that this function is continuousformula_28and vanishes in the complement of a compact set formula_29 The Berezin integral is the number
Change of even and odd variables.
Let a coordinate transformation be given by formula_31, where formula_32 are even and formula_33 are odd polynomials of formula_34 depending on even variables formula_35 The Jacobian matrix of this transformation has the block form:
where each even derivative formula_37 commutes with all elements of the algebra formula_20; the odd derivatives commute with even elements and anticommute with odd elements. The entries of the diagonal blocks formula_39 and formula_40 are even and the entries of the offdiagonal blocks formula_41 are odd functions, where formula_42 mean right derivatives. The Berezinian (or the superdeterminant) of the matrix formula_43 is the even function
defined when the function formula_45 is invertible in formula_46 Suppose that the real functions formula_47 define a smooth invertible map formula_48 of open sets formula_49 in formula_50 and the linear part of the map formula_51 is invertible for each formula_52 The general transformation law for the Berezin integral reads
where formula_55 is the sign of the orientation of the map formula_56 The superposition formula_57 is defined in the obvious way, if the functions formula_58 do not depend on formula_59 In the general case, we write formula_60 where formula_61 are even nilpotent elements of formula_20 and set
where the Taylor series is finite.
History.
The mathematical theory of the integral with commuting and anticommuting variables was invented and developed by Felix Berezin. Some important earlier insights were made by David John Candlin. Other authors contributed to these developments, including the physicists Khalatnikov (although his paper contains mistakes), Matthews and Salam [4, and Martin .

John Slagg

John Slagg (junior) (1841 - 7 May 1889) was a British businessman and Liberal politician.
He was the eldest son of John Slagg, a justice of the peace at Manchester, and his wife Jane née Crighton. John Slagg senior was a commission agent and merchant in the city. His friend, Anti Corn Law campaigner Richard Cobden was his son's godfather.
Slagg followed his father into business, and became president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. In 1885 he was appointed as a director of the Suez Canal Company. He made his home at Hopefield, Pendleton.
In 1880 he was elected as one of Manchester's three members of parliament. The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 divided the Manchester constituency into six divisions, and Slagg stood as the Liberal candidate at Manchester North West, but was defeated. He returned to the Commons at a bi-election in 1887 at Burnley.
In 1866 he married Katherine German of Sevenoaks, Kent.
John Slagg died at his Mayfair, London home in May 1889, aged 47.

Chandelor v Lopus

Chandelor v Lopus (1603) 79 ER 3 is a famous case in the common law of England. It stands for the distinction between warranties and mere affirmations and announced the rule of "caveat emptor" (buyer beware).
Facts.
A man paid £100 for what he thought was a bezoar stone. This is a stone that forms in animals' intestinal systems, and was believed to have magical healing properties. The seller said he thought it was a bezoar stone, but he also made clear that he could not be totally certain that it was. The buyer sued for the return of the £100 purchase price.
How the claimant discovered that the bezoar did not work is not discussed in the report.
Judgment.
The Exchequer Court held the buyer had no right to his money back, saying "the bare affirmation that it was a bezoar stone, without warranting it to be so, is no cause of action."
Significance.
Though scepticism over the alleged magical powers of bezoars may well have been justified, "Chandelor" long stood as an impediment to any common law development of consumer protection remedies. Only in the nineteenth century did the law begin to evolve a doctrine of implied warranty.

The 1971 Australian Grand Prix was a race held at Warwick Farm Raceway on 21 November 1971.
It was the thirty sixth running of the Australian Grand Prix. Frank Matich won his second straight AGP and like 1970, started the race on pole and also drove the fastest race lap. The race was the debut for Matich's self designed and built Matich A50 which was powered by a Repco Holden V8 engine. He won the race by 58.7 seconds from Kevin Bartlett driving a McLaren M10B-Chevrolet, with Alan Hamilton only 1.1 seconds behind Bartlett in third place. Hamilton also drove a McLaren M10B-Chevrolet.
Other than two New Zealanders, the only international driver in the event was Formula One World Drivers' Champion John Surtees. The Englishman started 9th in his Surtees TS8-Chevrolet, and after a race long duel with Bartlett, Hamilton, and until his retirement, Colin Bond in Frank Matich's McLaren M10B in which Matich had won the 1970 AGP, Surtees retired from second place with a puncture with only 6 laps remaining.

Milwaukee Chiefs (AFL)

The Milwaukee Chiefs were a professional American football team that competed in the third American Football League in 1940 and in 1941. The team played its home games in the Dairy Bowl in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Originally formed as an expansion team for the minor league formerly known as the American Professional Football Association for the 1940 season, the new team joined fellow AFL members Cincinnati Bengals and Columbus Bullies in becoming charter members of a new major-league AFL (the triple defection triggered the demise of the minor league, allowing the new major league to adopt the AFL name). The team president was George M. Harris.
In the two seasons of the league’s existence, the Chiefs fielded a competitive team. In 1940, the team scored the most points and gave up the fewest over the course of the season, but lost to Columbus in the final game to give the league championship to the Bullies. The following year, the Chiefs and the Bullies were joined by the New York Americans in a three-way race for the championship, with the Chiefs' continuing inability to defeat the Bullies (losing in Columbus and tying in Milwaukee) led to Columbus repeating as AFL champions and Milwaukee finishing third.
For the two years of the league’s existence, the Chiefs were a popular draw as they played in Wisconsin’s largest stadium. The AFL had accepted the 1941 entrance of a new Detroit team and deferred it until 1942, but the Pearl Harbor attack and the subsequent U.S. entry into World War II put all plans for football to a halt. In September 1942, league president William B. Cox announced the suspension of league activities until after the war, but the league – and the Chiefs – never returned.

Big Rig (film)

Big Rig (2008) is a documentary film by Doug Pray about long-haul truck drivers. The film consists of a series of interviews with different drivers, focusing on both their personal life stories and also the life and culture of truck drivers in the United States.
Production.
The film was shot with a crew of three people: director and cameraman Doug Pray, producer Brad Blondheim, and lighting, sound, and general production assistant Jim Dziura.
Filming took place over four different two-week roadtrips. The crew of three did not schedule interviews with truckers: they would drive into a truck stop in their RV and approach the truckers for interviews. If the driver agreed, Pray would ride as the passenger and interview the driver for the day, while Blondheim followed in the RV. Most of the interviewees were very skeptical of the crew at first, and the crew was repeatedly thrown out of truck stops for soliciting interviews, which is typically not allowed.
Director Pray and producer Blondheim became interested in a trucker documentary after a series of road trips to various concerts during the filming of Pray's "Scratch". In 2001, Pray and Blondheim shot and edited a 10-minute film as a proof of concept for the film's production process.
For the film's music, producer Blondheim was inspired by the roots music featured in the film "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?". One of the music producers from "Scratch" interested them in the music of Buck 65. The final cut of the film uses several contributions from Buck 65; about one third of this was composed specifically for the film.
The film was shot on a Panasonic Varicam and edited by the director using Final Cut Pro.
In July 2012 it was announced by several in the truck driving community and by a source inside Ocule Films that there will be a sequel to the film, No time frame for when filming or production will begin on the sequel.
Reception.
The film was an official selection of the Seattle International Film Festival and AFI Fest, and was featured at a handful of other small film festivals. It was released on DVD in late 2008.
The film was and remains a big hit with the trucking community and truck drivers.

Joe Lonnett

Joseph Paul Lonnett (February 7, 1927 – December 5, 2011) was a catcher and coach in Major League Baseball. As a player, he threw and batted right-handed, stood 5'10½" (179 cm) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg).
Biography.
Playing career.
Lonnett signed with the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent in 1948, and spent much of his career with the Phillies as a minor league catcher and manager, and Major League catcher and scout. 
He missed two seasons while serving in the United States Navy in World War II and the Korean War. He spent four seasons as a catcher in MLB with the Phillies, as a second-string receiver, appearing in 143 games, and batting .166 with six home runs and 27 runs batted in — never once cracking the .200 level for a season.
Coaching career.
He returned to the Major Leagues as the third-base coach on Chuck Tanner's staff with the Chicago White Sox from 1971–1975, and the Oakland Athletics in 1976. Tanner, also a native of Western Pennsylvania and a former Major League outfielder, had promised that if he ever became a big league manager, Lonnett would be one of his coaches. Tanner honored his word, and Lonnett worked with him with the White Sox and A's.
When Tanner was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Manny Sanguillén — only the second trade in MLB history to involve a manager — Lonnett followed him to Pittsburgh. He wore Sanguillen's No. 35 jersey until the Pirates traded for Sanguillen a year later. He then wore No. 32 and would eventually serve as the third-base coach on the Pirates' 1979 world championship team.
Later life.
Lonnett battled Alzheimer's disease and was cared for by his wife of 56 years, Alvida. He attended the 25th anniversary celebration of the World Series champions in 2004 at PNC Park. Lonnett died in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania on December 5, 2011. He was 84.

Landssamanslutninga av Vasskraftkommunar

Landssamanslutninga av Vasskraftkommunar (LVK) is a Norwegian interest group. It groups municipalities that are involved in hydropower production.
Established in 1978, in 2004 it had a membership of 150 municipalities, accounting for 60% of the area of Norway, but only 16% of the population. Among the member municipalities, all counties are represented except for Oslo, Akershus and Vestfold. While Oslo is not a member of LVK, its headquarters are nonetheless located there.
The national leader is Børre Rønningen, mayor of Vinje. Ingvald Godal, a former mayor of Vinje, chaired LVK from 1977 to 1985.
It maintains good ties with the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities (KS). It has faced the employers' organisation Norwegian Electricity Industry Association (EBL) as an opponent on many occasions, despite the fact that many of the companies that comprise the Electricity Industry Association are owned by LVK member municipalities.
It publishes the magazine "LVK-nytt".

Overpopulation

Overpopulation occurs when a population of a species exceeds the carrying capacity of its ecological niche. Overpopulation is a function of the number of individuals compared to the relevant resources, such as the water and essential nutrients they need to survive. It can result from an increase in births, a decline in mortality rates, an increase in immigration, or an unsustainable biome and depletion of resources. 
Introduction.
Every person in the world can fit in the Los Angeles county.
In the wilderness, the problems of overpopulation in species is often solved by growth in the population of predators. Predators tend to look for signs of weakness in their prey, and therefore usually first eat the old or sick animals. This has the side effects of controlling the prey population and ensuring its evolution in favor of genetic characteristics that enhance escape from predation (and the predator may co-evolve, in response).
In the absence of predators, species are bound by the resources they can find in their environment, but this does not necessarily control overpopulation, at least in the short term. In fact, an abundant supply of resources can produce a "population boom" that ends up with more individuals than the environment can support. In this case, starvation, thirst and sometimes violent competition for scarce resources may effect a sharp reduction in population in a very short lapse (a "population crash"). Lemmings, as well as other less popular species of rodents, are known to have such cycles of rapid population growth and subsequent decrease.
Some species seem to have a measure of self-control, by which individuals refrain from mating when they find themselves in a crowded environment. This voluntary abstinence may be induced by stress or by pheromones.
In an ideal setting, when animal populations grow, so do the number of predators that feed on that particular animal. Animals that have birth defects or weak genes (such as the runt of the litter) are unable to compete over food with stronger, healthier animals.
In reality, an animal that is not native to an environment may have advantages over the native ones, such being unsuitable for the local predators. If left uncontrolled, such an animal can quickly overpopulate and ultimately destroy its environment.
Examples.
Examples of overpopulation caused by introduction of a foreign species abound: 
Examples of overpopulation caused by natural cyclic variations include: 
Human overpopulation.
The human population has been growing continuously since the end of the Black Death, around the year 1400, although the most significant increase has been in the last 50 years, mainly due to medical advancements, increases in agricultural productivity and the historically-unique availability of abundant cheap energy. The rate of population growth has been declining since the 1980s. Most contemporary estimates for the carrying capacity of the Earth under existing conditions are between 4 billion and 16 billion. Depending on which estimate is used, human overpopulation may or may not have already occurred. 
The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth, circa 1994, has stated that many environmental problems, such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, global warming, and pollution, are aggravated by the population expansion. Other problems associated with overpopulation include the increased demand for resources such as fresh water and food, starvation and malnutrition, consumption of natural resources (such as fossil fuels) faster than the rate of regeneration, and a deterioration in living conditions. However, some believe that waste and over-consumption, especially by wealthy nations, is putting more strain on the environment than overpopulation.
Overpopulation in domestic animals.
Ethical issues of humaneness arise also from the unintended population growth of dogs, cats, and other domestic animals. Outcomes include euthanization of former pets and release of former pets to the wild. These issues are of considerable poignance to many persons.

Anguilla national cricket team

The Anguilla national cricket team is the representative cricket team of Anguilla.
The team takes part in inter-regional cricket competitions in the Caribbean, but has only appeared in major cricket twice, in the two Stanford 20/20 tournaments. For domestic first-class and List A purposes, Anguilla is subsumed into the Leeward Islands cricket team. The first Anguillan to play Test cricket for West Indies was Omari Banks in 2003. 
History.
Representative cricket has been played by Anguilla since the late 1970s. Early games were played as part of the three-day (but not first-class) Heineken Challenge Trophy (the sponsored Leeward Islands Tournament), although at first the team was not a full participant and played only two games each year in the 1977, 1978 and 1979 tournaments.
The team suffered a run of heavy defeats in their early years; Anguilla's first win in the competition came against Montserrat in the 1980 tournament.
Anguilla's only games of major cricket have come in Twenty20, as part of the Stanford 20/20 competitions in 2006 and 2007-08. Their debut at this level was against Barbados at the Stanford Cricket Ground in Coolidge, Antigua on 18 July 2006; Barbados won the match by 38 runs.
On 3 February 2008, they played Grenada, who won by 16 runs despite a 39-ball unbeaten 75 from Anguilla's Montcin Hodge.

Artibus et Historiae

Artibus et Historiae is a semi-annual publication of art historical research published by IRSA (Institute for Art Historical Research) since 1980. It is a scholarly peer review journal embracing a broad range of topics within the field of art history; however, it aims to address interdisciplinary connections at the peripheries of art and other humanistic fields, such as psychology, sociology, philosophy, or literature.
It appears twice a year, in hardback. The articles are in one of four languages: English, Italian, German, or French
"Artibus et Historiae" is indexed in the Bibliography of the History of Art (BHA) and its articles are deposited in electronic form accessible through JSTOR.
Title and Logo.
"Artibus et Historiae" takes its title from the private experiences of its founder and editor-in-chief, Polish art historian Dr. Józef Grabski. “Artibus” is an inscription on the fronton of an old and very prestigious art exhibition hall, "Zachęta" (Society for Encouragement of Fine Arts, founded in 1860), in his native Warsaw. The second part of the title, “Historiae”, is a tribute paid to the Countess Karolina Lanckorońska, professor of art history and editor of Polish historical sources in her own "Institutum Historicum Polonicum" in Rome, Italy.
The logo of IRSA and Artibus et Historiae - a symbolic representation of a winged putto standing firmly on a balance, held in his own hands - comes from a Renaissance painting by Lorenzo Lotto ("Portrait of a Man Aged Thirty-Seven". c. 1542 Collection Doria Pamphili, Rome) and symbolizes the Platonic idea of internal equilibrium between the spiritual and the physical aspects of the activities and existence of man.
History.
Artibus et Historiae is the primary publication issued by IRSA. The idea of publishing a new art journal was conceived by Dr. Grabski in the late 1970s and realized after the International Congress of Art History (CIHA) in Bologna (1979). Thus IRSA Publishing House was brought into being and the first number of Artibus et Historiae appeared in 1980. It has since continued to feature groundbreaking articles at the forefront of art historical research. In 2009 the periodical will celebrate thirty years of international readership.
Journal Profile.
Artibus et Historiae presents scholarly contributions to the field of art history addressing a wide-ranging spectrum of topics. Although art history remains the main focus of the journal, many articles address interdisciplinary aspects at the frontiers of art and other humanistic fields, such as psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature. Likewise, articles are not limited to particular media or form and many address topics in photography or film as well as the theory and reception of art.
Certain works, which due to their length, could not have been published in periodical form, have appeared as volumes in the series from Bibliotheca Artibus et Historiae.

Conformation (dog)

Conformation in dogs refers solely to the externally visible details of a dog's structure and appearance, as defined in detail by each dog breed's written breed standard. A dog that "conforms" to most of the items of description in its individual breed standard is said to have "good conformation". Unlike equine conformation, there are no fixed rules for dog conformation, as dogs are the most variable in appearance of any animals ("Phenotypic variation among dog breeds, whether it be in size, shape, or behavior, is greater than for any other animal"). Instead, conformation in dogs is based on the dog type from which the breed developed, along with many details that have been added to the breed standard for purposes of differentiation from other breeds, for working reasons, or for enhancing the beauty of the animals from the viewpoint of the fanciers who wrote the breed standards.
Breed standards.
The breed standard for each breed of dog details desirable and undesirable attributes of "appearance" and "temperament" for an individual breed. Due to the great variability in dogs, there is no one standard of good conformation. What is good conformation for a lapdog will not be good conformation for a guard dog; good leg structure for a dog that must travel long distances will not be the same as good leg structure for dogs whose conformation requires short bursts of speed.
Breed standards are designed solely to describe the breed's history and purpose, temperament, and appearance. The breed standard is "not" a checkbox list of requirements, but rather a description, giving a detailed "word picture" of an "idealized" dog of that breed. Requirements for documentation, genetic testing, health testing, testing for particular styles of work or fitness for particular dog sports or requirements for training are beyond the scope of a breed standard, and are instead developed as breeder guidelines by breed clubs, kennel clubs, or even by national agricultural department rules. "Conformation" refers solely to the externally visible details of a dog's structure and appearance, along with the dog's expected temperament, which varies for each breed or type of dog.
For details about contents of a breed's "breed standard" and what is considered "good conformation" for a particular breed, see the article about that specific breed of dog.

H square

In mathematics and control theory, H2, or "H-square" is a Hardy space with square norm. It is a subspace of "L"2 space, and is thus a Hilbert space. In particular, it is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.
On the unit circle.
In general, elements of "L"2 on the unit circle are given by 
whereas elements of "H"2 are given by 
The projection from "L"2 to "H"2 (by setting "a""n" = 0 when "n" < 0) is orthogonal.
On the half-plane.
The Laplace transform formula_3 given by 
can be understood as a linear operator 
where formula_6 is the set of square-integrable functions on the positive real number line, and formula_7 is the right half of the complex plane. It is more; it is an isomorphism, in that it is invertible, and it isometric, in that it satisfies
The Laplace transform is "half" of a Fourier transform; from the decomposition
one then obtains an orthogonal decomposition of formula_10 into two Hardy spaces
This is essentially the Paley-Wiener theorem.

St. Edmund's Chapel, Lyng

The ruins of St. Edmund's Chapel are located in a field to the east of the village of Lyng, Norfolk, England.
The chapel was formerly part of a Benedictine nunnery. It is unknown when the chapel was built, but the nuns moved away to Thetford in 1176. However we know that chapel was not abandoned. 
There is a glimpse of the chapel preserved in the Bodleian MS 240.This dates from the 1370s, when in the space of five years there were seven miracles connected with the chapel. These mostly involved accidents in the surrounding villages, such as Bylaugh, Scarning and Sparham, but one involved a man from Kent whose wife was cured of paralysis. The ruins of the chapel which remain are not extensive but obviously date from after the removal of the nuns to Thetford; the window arches incorporate brick work which is probably fifteenth century. It is possible that it remained in use until the reformation. It was probably a chapel of ease for the hamlet of Lyng Eastaugh, in which it lies.
A newspaper article records a tradition concerning the chapel. It was said that it was founded for the nuns to pray for the souls of those killed in a battle between the Danes and king Edmund’s Anglo-Saxons. It stands next to a wood whose name appears in a nineteenth century tithe map as King’s Grove. The wood contains a boulder – an erratic of conglomerate stone, left in the moraine of a retreating glacier. The stone is about 2 metres long by 1 metre wide, and is named St Edmund’s Stone on the map which accompanies the newspaper article.
 When the nuns left Lyng in the twelfth century they retained the income derved from holding the annual fair on 20 November (St Edmund’s day). This fair long outlived the nunnery; it survived into the last quarter of the nineteenth century and is mentioned in Parson Woodforde’s diary. There was also a guild of St Edmund in the village.

San Francisco Police Department Park Station bombing

The San Francisco Police Department Park Station bombing occurred on February 16, 1970, when a pipe bomb filled with shrapnel detonated on the ledge of a window at the San Francisco Police Department's Golden Gate Park station.
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, "Investigators in the early '70s said the bombing likely was the work of the Weather Underground, and not the Black Liberation Army" 
An investigation was reopened in 1999. A San Francisco grand jury looked into the incident, but no indictments followed. 
In early 2009 conservative advocacy group America's Survival Inc. advocated for a murder charge against Bill Ayers of the Weather Underground. In connection with a press release, the group released a letter from the San Francisco Police Officers Association endorsing an earlier allegation by Larry Grathwohl, a former FBI informant within the Weather Underground, that "there are 'irrefutable and compelling reasons' that establish that Ayers and his wife, Bernadine Dohrn, are responsible for the bombing."
The case has yet to be solved and remains an active case.

Real Estate Council of Ontario

Established in 1997, the Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) is a not-for-profit corporation that regulates the trade of real estate in Ontario in the public interest. On behalf of the Ontario government, RECO administers and enforces the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, 2002 (REBBA 2002) and its regulations.
As the regulator, RECO makes sure real estate professionals follow rules designed to uphold the integrity of the industry and protect consumers. In Ontario, any individual or business trading in real estate must be registered with RECO. As of March 2013, there were about 66,000 real estate registrants (salespersons, brokers and brokerages) in the province.
Mission.
RECO’s Mission Statement is: “Excellence in the delivery of regulatory services that protect the public interest and enhance consumer confidence in the real estate profession.”
RECO’s Vision is: “Public trust and confidence in Ontario’s real estate profession.”
RECO aims to accomplish this by enforcing requirements for pre-registration and continuing education, enforcing standards required to obtain and maintain registration, addressing complaints about the conduct of real estate professionals and serving as an independent source of information for consumers about Ontario’s real estate industry.
Governance.
RECO is governed by a 12-member Board of Directors composed of nine registered real estate professionals elected by their peers and three non-registrants appointed by the Minister of Consumer Services to represent consumers, business and government. Board members serve a three-year term. The Chair is Glenda Brindle. The Vice-Chair is Jody Lavoie.
The day-to-day management of RECO is led by Tom Wright, President and CEO.
The duties of enforcing REBBA 2002 are the responsibility of the Registrar, Joseph Richer.
Complaints.
Anyone with concerns about the service provided by a real estate professional can submit a complaint to RECO. Complaint forms are available on RECO’s website (www.reco.on.ca). Once a complaint is received, RECO will conduct an investigation as required. The Registrar will determine an appropriate response.
RECO does not have authority to resolve financial or contractual disputes or provide any form of compensation to a complainant.
Registrant Search Feature.
Only RECO provides information about every individual who is registered to trade in real estate in Ontario. The “Registrant Search” feature on RECO’s website is a tool that allows consumers to confirm whether they are dealing with someone who is legally registered to trade in real estate in Ontario and whether that person has been the subject of any discipline activity.
Resource.
RECO reaches out to both consumers and real estate professionals by publishing newsletters, posting videos, attending trade shows as well as through social media (Twitter: @RECOhelps).
Beginning in October 2012, Registrar Joseph Richer answers common questions from home buyers and sellers in a weekly “Ask Joe” column appearing in the Saturday edition of the Toronto Star.

Matt Williams (American football)

Matt Williams (born in Weatherford, Texas) is a former walk-on place kicker for the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team. Williams was offered the position, two other players having failed to succeed for the team at that point, after winning a year's worth of free rent in a place-kicking contest at one of the Red Raiders games.
Early years.
Williams attended Weatherford High School in Weatherford, Texas, where he played soccer and football. In football, he played both wide receiver and kicker. His signature moment as a kicker occurred when he kicked a 49-yard field goal through the uprights to defeat rival Mineral Wells High School in overtime. He graduated from Weatherford in 2006.
College career.
Tarleton State.
Williams walked on at Tarleton State University as a football player, though was only on the team for a month and never played a game.
Texas Tech.
After two years at Tarleton State, Williams transferred to Texas Tech. During halftime of Tech's September 20, 2008, football game against the University of Massachusetts, Williams entered a promotional contest in which he made a 30-yard field goal. He caught the attention of head coach Mike Leach, who liked the fundamentals he used on the kick. Leach wanted him on the team, and although it was initially thought he would not be immediately eligible, the NCAA granted a one-time exception based on the specific circumstances. He was allowed to play immediately as he had not been recruited by Tarleton State and also because he was never a scholarship player. However, the season he played on Tarleton State's squad counted toward his eligibility, making him a sophomore during his first year at Tech. He also had to reject the free rent he won in the contest in order to remain eligible.
Williams made his debut in a 63–21 win over Kansas where he was a perfect 9 for 9 on PATs. Following the game, Williams was recognized as the AT&T ESPN All-America Player of the Week.
The following week, in Texas Tech's 39–33 victory over Texas, Williams was also asked to kick field goals, making two and having one blocked.

William Henry Lang

William Henry Lang FRS (12 May 1874–29 August 1960) was a British botanist. The son of Thomas Lang, a medical practitioner, Lang was educated at Dennistoun public school in Glasgow before being accepted into the University of Glasgow, where he graduated with a Bsc (Hons) in botany and zoology in 1894. He qualified for medicine in 1895 but never became a practicing doctor; thanks to his own enthusiasm and the encouragement of his teacher Frederick Orpen Bower he instead became a professional botanist. His first research was on the structure of ferns, something Bower was apparently an authority on, and Lang soon followed him in that regard. He moved to study at the Jodrell Laboratory on a Robert Donaldson scholarship in 1895, where he focused on the apomixis of ferns, and discovered a sporangium on the prothallus of a fern at a time when biologists were exploring alternate means of reproduction in plants.
In 1899 he travelled to Sri Lanka and Malaya to study tropical cryptogams and collect samples, returning to Britain in 1902, when became a lecturer at the University of Glasgow; while there he worked closely with D. T. Gwynne-Vaughan] and Bower, with the three of them being known as the "triumvirate". After Gwynne-Vaughan's death in 1915 he studied preserved plant remnants in Aberdeen, making great insights into the nature of "Psilophyton", which until then had been neglected. In 1900 he was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by the University of Glasgow, and when the Barker chair of cryptogamic botany was created at the University of Manchester Lang was the first choice. He took up his duties in 1909 and married his cousin, Elsa Valentine, the following year.
In 1911 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and was awarded a Royal Medal in 1931 for 'his work on the anatomy and morphology of the fern-like fossils of the Old Red Sandstone.' In 1932 he received an LLD from the University of Glasgow, followed by a similar award from Manchester in 1942. He was also a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. After his retirement he moved to Westfield due to his wife's ill health' she died in 1959, and he followed barely a year later on 29 August 1960.

Theresia

, known in Japan as Theresia: Dear Emile, is a psychological horror visual novel adventure game developed by WorkJam and published by Aksys Games, released exclusively for the Nintendo DS. It is one of the few DS games to received an ESRB rating of M for "Mature" and a CERO rating of C or "ages 15 and older". The game was released on September 11, 2008 in Japan and on October 30, 2008 in North America.
The game is a part of the mobile phone game series of the same name.
Premise.
"Theresia" is a psychological horror visual novel adventure game from a first-person perspective, consisting of two stories, each sharing a common background: an unnamed country, presumably under strict martial law by the time the game takes place, is engaged in a fierce and bloody war with an unspecified opposing nation. No further details are provided: the player is then thrust directly into the role of Leanne, protagonist of the first half of the story.
Upon completion, a shorter second chapter with an unnamed protagonist is unlocked, providing a deeper insight into the overarching background narrative.
Throughout the course of the game, both characters have to explore their confinements, trying to escape and learn the details of their past, avoiding traps and coming face to face with personal demons and other psychological dilemmas along the way. The game made use of the Nintendo DS touch screen capabilities.
Plot.
Dear Emile - Leanne, a teenage girl wakes up in a small, barely lit room. She has no memories, and the only tangible clue is the word "Theresia" scribbled upon a piece of paper. The first areas of the game are used to instruct the player on the controls, set the atmosphere and introduce the survival aspect: in fact, the building reveals itself to not only be merely the sub-basement of a larger complex, but also to be riddled with traps, each hidden in even the most unexpected places. Only careful observation or usage of a 2x4 can reveal them to the character (as a gameplay mechanic, the wooden piece will shatter upon use). Most of the doors are locked, barricaded, or lead to places blocked by environmental hazards created by the state of disrepair permeating the structure. Proceeding, Leanne discovers that the place is an underground facility containing a prison, stretching over several underground stories and including waterworks, storage and torture rooms, even some unknown crypts; the decrepitude of the place is evident by a suddenly flooding level, fallen sustain braces and short-circuited equipment, as well as strange red beads crawling all over the walls - later discovered to be called Theresia.
By reaching the upper levels, more of the setting and personal background of Leanne are revealed: The country is losing the war, and the prison is part of a military installation (now decimated) which includes a testing laboratory, run by a woman named Maylee, who Leanne has seen in flashbacks. She also has flashbacks of a young man named Sacha and a silver-haired woman, who was drenched in and smelled of blood.
Evidence reveals that the testing revolves around a bioweapon of the enemy, known to cause uncontrollable hemorrhaging, high fever, madness, amnesia, and ultimately death as the body gradually swells and turns purple. After the death of someone infected, it becomes a highly contagious airborne virus, making the corpses highly contagious. In order to stop the virus, known was Epicari, from spreading, the bodies would be burned. As Leanne finally reaches the surface, she visits the above-ground portion of the installation, built under a church (thus explaining the crypts and other religious features, such as an angel statue), until finally reaching the commander's office.
Journal entries and notes Leanne has discovered along the way cause her to have flashbacks and gain back bits and pieces of her memory. She remembers that, as an infant, she was the sole survivor of a village destroyed in the war. The silver-haired woman who haunted her memories was Emile-a torturer for one country's military,-who found her. She took the girl in as her daughter, giving her the name "Leanne".
Leanne grew up mostly at the church, watched over by the priest who ran it. She caught the eye of a young boy named Sacha and longed to talk to him, but had not due to her mother making her promise never to talk to anyone but her. Emile would often visit her, but she recalled her mother as cold and frightening, and she wonders if the woman cared for her at all.
Sacha and Leanne began exchanging letters in secret. When Emile discovered Sacha embracing Leanne, the woman ran at him with a knife. One of the other church members got in the way and was killed. Emile was restrained and taken to the underground part of the facility. She was no longer allowed to visit Leanne.
Epicari had begun to surface, and many people were dying. Maylee showed up with a bunch of scientists and was able to create a cure from Emile's blood. This was called "Theresia", which was her last name. She reminded Maylee of someone, whose blood also was used to create a cure in the past. Leanne also made her think of this person, as the girl would pray for the infected without fear as their corpses were burned.
As the virus continued to spread, the military decided to move everyone underground, to the large area they had been using as a base. Though Sacha tried to convince Leanne to run away with him, as the two had fallen in love with each other, Leanne couldn't forget Emile. She asked Maylee to take her to see her mother. The minute Emile saw Leanne, she took her to one of the prison cells, put her in chains, and locked her up. Leanne did not mind this, though, as she was happy to be her mother's alone and enjoyed being visited by her.
Eventually, the military ordered the deaths of everyone not on their staff, hoping to finally stop the virus from spreading. Sacha came to release a reluctant Leanne, but was discovered by Emile. He pointed a gun at her, but she calmed him down and hugged him by singing him a lullaby she often used to sing an infant Leanne. She took the gun from him and shot him in the head, killing him. Then, she tried to escape with Leanne and was assisted by Maylee, who had come to care for the two of them. Emile murdered many of her own comrades in an effort to protect her daughter, and it is the memory of this which makes Leanne realize that her mother really did love her.
At some point, Leanne herself had become infected with Epicari. She was given the vaccine Theresia made from her mother's blood by Maylee, but a side-effect of both the virus and the vaccine was amnesia, thus why she couldn't remember anything upon waking up. The one who left her journal entries was likely Emile, who wanted her to remember. Emile is also the one who set up the traps, out of a twisted sense of love. She was keeping Leanne safe by preventing people from getting to her, as well as preventing her from leaving.
In the commander's office, Leanne finds what seems to be the body of her mother and mourns her death. She leaves some red flowers that also held a strong place in her memory, as she often spent time with both her mother and Maylee among them. She takes the final key needed for her escape, with her mother had seemingly been protecting. Casting aside everything on her person, along with the pendant her mother had given her, Leanne escapes the destructing facility.
Outside, she finds an abandoned infant, which she resolves to take in. After the credits, the camera zooms in on Leanne kneeling outside with the baby, Emile standing behind her. There is a strange noise, and the camera falls over. It is unclear what this means, though popular theories are that the body Leanne found was not Emile's, and that the woman was still alive and had attacked her in order to stop her from escaping or that this was symbolic of Leanne still being in her mother's clutches, as she starts to follow the same path as her-taking in an orphaned child and passing on a twisted sense of love.
Dear Martel - The second chapter more directly focuses on the war and its effects on the populace through the struggle of an unnamed character. Like Leanne, he wakes up in a rundown location-in the case, a mansion-with no memories. Also like her, he encounters many traps and slowly regains his memories through flashbacks prompted by journal entries and notes he finds. He also comes across many hateful and cryptic messages scrawled on the walls.
The protagonist is eventually revealed to be a doctor. Martel was the name of his sister, who had a different father than him. After the death of their mother soon after she was born, he sent her to an orphanage ran by their grandfather. He was adopted and continued his studies. Years later, he returns to the orphanage to be a doctor and to do research. He is reunited with Martel, who has grown into a kind, beautiful young woman. The two seem to get along well. He also becomes friends with two other doctors there Franz and Maylee. The doctor becomes very happy with his new family.
Unfortunately, the doctors unknowingly create the Epicari virus and infect the children. As the virus spreads, they request help from the government. Soldiers come, but only to forcibly take samples from the children. The orphanage is then quarantined. As more and more children die, the doctor, Franz, and Maylee struggle to find a cure. Martel buries the dead children without fear of being infected herself, and the fact that she doesn't eventually leads to the creation of the vaccine Theresia from her blood(it's theorized Martel and Emile share the same father, since the blood of both could be used to make the vaccine, meaning they shared DNA).
By this time, Franz was unknowingly infected with Epicari. He had suddenly started hiding his face, claiming he hated how he looked. One of the symptoms of the virus was the exacerbation of personal issues, but because they falsely believed the virus only affected children, they didn't realize this until it was too late. Eventually he went mad and attacked people with an axe. When his mask fell off, he killed himself by ramming his face into the axe embedded in the wall.
Maylee was also infected and suffering from the symptoms of the virus, during which she became intimate with the protagonist. She was cured of the infection by the vaccine her and the doctor would create.
Though they finally managed to create the vaccine, the place was stormed by soldiers. The staff tried to tell them that they now had a cure, the soldiers were relentless and used flamethrowers to massacre all the children and many of the staff. The doctor managed to hide with Martel, but was separated from Maylee. She ultimately survived, going on to try and create more of the vaccine as shown in Dear Emile's story.
When everything was over, the doctor and Martel left their hiding places. A disheveled and slightly-bloody Martel stepped on and killed an insect without realizing it. The doctor, who was unknowingly suffering from Epicari himself, snaps from this sight and strangles her. He buries her amongst the red flowers she had grown outside the orphanage. Knowing he will soon forget, the doctor leaves the notes and journal entries to remind him what he has done. He also sets up the traps and writes the messages on the wall, as a way to punish himself for what he has done.
After getting the vaccine and remembering everything, the doctor desperately tries to dig up Martel's body but cannot find it. He is happened upon by Maylee, who talks with him. She tells him about another side-effect of the vaccine, which is unknown to the player, which makes him smile bitterly. The two then walk off together.

Anne Anastasi

Anne Anastasi (December 19, 1908 – May 4, 2001) was an American psychologist best known for her pioneering development of psychometrics. Her seminal work, "Psychological Testing", remains a classic text in which she drew attention to the individual being tested and therefore to the responsibilities of the testers. She called for them to go beyond test scores, to search the assessed individuals’ history to help them to better understand their own results and themselves.
Known as the “test guru,” Anastasi focused on what she believed to be the appropriate use of psychometric tests. As stated in an obituary, “She made major conceptual contributions to the understanding of the manner in which psychological development is influenced by environmental and experiential factors. Her writings have provided incisive commentary on test construction and the proper application of psychological tests.”. According to Anastasi, such tests only revealed what the test-taker knows at the time; they did not explain test scores. In addition, any psychometric measurement must take into account that aptitude is context-dependent. Anastasi stressed the importance of the role of the tester to correctly select, conduct, and evaluate tests.
She was president of the American Psychological Association in 1965 (to 1967), the third ever woman to be elected. In 1987, she was awarded the National Medal of Science.
Problems Researcher Addressed.
Anastasi’s (1983) essay “What Do Intelligence Tests Measure?” aimed to correct misinterpretations regarding the understanding and use of aptitude and personality tests. Anastasi pointed out that the “testing boom” of the 1920s caused the term IQ to be adopted and misused by the general public. According to Anastasi, the misappropriation of the term created connotations that intelligence is heritable, stable throughout one’s lifespan, and resistant to change.
In contrast, Anastasi emphasized that psychometric scores convey an individual’s present status of what he or she knows. She cautioned against interpreting such tests as serving a strong predictive function, as scores only indicated to what degree a person acquired the knowledge and skills for the criterion of a given test. They evaluate for what is in high demand within a specific context; what an individual can achieve in the future depends not only on his or her present intellectual status as determined by the test, but also on subsequent experiences. Therefore, Anastasi advocated against psychometric tests definitively labelling a person, as they assess for specific types of knowledge and do not account for how intelligence can change over time.
Important to Anastasi was an understanding of the cultural frames of reference within which a test is developed. She stated that “No intelligence test can be culture free, because human intelligence is not culture free”. Therefore, according to Anastasi, the first step in developing an intelligence test within a given culture was formulating a task analysis in order to determine how well individuals gain knowledge valued within that culture.
Methods.
Anastasi mostly applied existing methods to individual and group ability testing, as well as self-report inventories and measuring interests and attitudes. She followed the methodological principles of norms, reliability, validity, and item analysis. The essay “Psychological Testing: Basic Concepts and Common Misconceptions,” encapsulates Anastasi’s methodological positions. Anastasi stressed that, in order to evaluate any psychometric test, the tester must be knowledgeable of the main features of the tests, particularly as they apply to norms, validity, and reliability. Her approach to standard scores and standard deviation was one in which she believed that understanding statistical concepts was essential to understanding the meaning of statistical computation.
In regards to criterion-referenced tests, Anastasi diverged from educational psychologist Robert Glaser, who first introduced the concept in 1963. Instead of approaching such tests as fundamentally different from norm-referenced tests, Anastasi maintained that the two could be combined to give a more comprehensive evaluation of the individual's test performance. An example is the Stanford Diagnostic Test in reading and mathematics, which assesses specific subject mastery by combining both interpretations.
Anastasi recognized that there are many types of test reliability. However, when dealing with standardized testing, much of the variance in reliability can be minimized by controlling such conditions as the testing environment, rapport, instructions, and time limits.
In contrast with the belief that there are three kinds of validity - content validity, criterion validity, and construct validity - Anastasi espoused to the then-growing belief of the mid-1980s that many more procedures could be used to build validity into a test. Defining the constructs to be assessed initiates the validation process. It culminates with “validating and cross-validating various scores through statistical analyses against external, real-life criteria”.
Interpretation of Test Scores.
In "Psychological Testing: Basic Concepts and Common Misconceptions," Anastasi clarified differences between types of tests. Two differences between aptitude tests and achievement tests are test use and the degree of experiential specificity forming the foundation of the tests’ construction. Achievement tests are used to assess current status; aptitude tests can predict future performance as defined by their specific criteria. Experiential specificity is narrowly defined for achievement tests, such as SAT Subject Tests. In contrast, the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales aptitude tests are based on broad knowledge of American culture beginning in the twentieth century.
Theoretical Stance.
Anastasi’s theoretical framework that ability or intelligence change with experience and that their cultural context dictates their parameters informed her methodological approach to psychometric testing. Tests should be selected and used while bearing in mind their contextual appropriateness and limitations. She emphasized that tests serve specific functions in Western society, such as school/occupational placement or to assess for mental disabilities.
Criticism.
The 1955 first edition of Psychological Testing was criticized for attributing test results only to individual differences, instead of recognizing that “‘occasional differences’ are also measured by means of tests". In the latest edition of the book, Anastasi and her co-author Susana Urbina suggested that more accurate results can be obtained by combining information from several fairly homogeneous tests. Each one would cover a single trait, or different aspect of the criterion.

Charles Francis Massey Swynnerton

Charles Francis Massy Swynnerton CMG (3 December 1877 Folkestone Kent - 8 June 1938 Mjari, Tanzania), was an English-born naturalist noted for his contributions to tsetse fly research.
His father was a senior chaplain in the Indian Army, and his mother the daughter of Major W. H. Massy, of Grantstown Hall, Tipperary. Swynnerton spent his early years in India, returning to England to start his schooling at Lancing College in Sussex. In 1897 he was accepted at Oxford University, but emigrated to Africa instead.
In Natal he met the renowned entomologist and authority on Curculionidae, Guy Anstruther Knox Marshall (1871–1959), who owned some farms in Southern Rhodesia and persuaded Swynnerton to manage one of these in the Melsetter district. In 1900 he became manager of Gungunyana Farm close to the Chirinda Forest in the Chipinga District - this farm was also bought by Guy Marshall in 1902. For the following 19 years Swynnerton used the farm as a base and worked on comprehensive collections of plants, birds and insects, the plants being written up later in 1911 in "J. Linn. Soc. (Bot.)" 40:1-245 as "Flora of Gazaland". The British Museum was a regular recipient of his plant and insect specimens which were lauded for displaying ""a precision in localisation and notes on economic uses which made this collection a model one"". He was elected a Fellow of the Linnaean Society in 1907. From the farm he made a number of collecting trips to the nearby Chimanimani Mountains. During this period Guy Marshall became chief editor of the "Bulletin of Entomological Research" and remained a close friend and mentor to Swynnerton.
The Rhodesian government appointed him in 1918 to research the tsetse fly problem, later that year extending his brief to also cover Moçambique. In 1919 he was appointed as the first game warden of Tanganyika, again with a brief to investigate the tsetse situation, and becoming Director of Tsetse Research at Shinyanga ten years later.
In 1937 he was awarded the CMG and died in a de Havilland Leopard Moth plane crash the following year on his way to receiving the award. His obituary in "Nature" was penned by Sir Guy Marshall. Swynnerton is commemorated by the genus "Swynnertonia" (Swynnerton's Robin) and in some 40 specific plant names, as well as bird and insect names.

<doc id="20041810" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20041810" title="Speed of light (cellular automaton)">
Speed of light (cellular automaton)

In Conway's Game of Life (and related cellular automata), the speed of light is a propagation rate across the grid of exactly one step (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally) per generation. In a single generation, a cell can only influence its nearest neighbours, and so the speed of light (by analogy with the speed of light in physics) is the maximum rate at which information can propagate. It is therefore an upper bound to the speed at which any pattern can move.
Notation.
As in physics, the speed of light is represented with the letter formula_1. This in turn is used as a reference for describing the average propagation speed of spaceships. For example, a glider is said to have a speed of formula_2, as it takes four generations for a given state to be translated by one cell. Similarly, the "lightweight spaceship" is said to have a speed of formula_3, as it takes four generations for a given state to be translated by two cells.
Lightspeed propagation.
While formula_1 is an absolute upper bound to propagation speed, the maximum speed of a spaceship in Conway's Game of Life is in fact formula_3. This is because it is impossible to build a spaceship that can move every generation. (This is not true for Life, though, for cellular automata in general; for instance many light-speed spaceships exist in Seeds.) It is, however, possible for objects to travel at the speed of light if they move through a medium other than empty space. Such media include trails of hives, and alternating stripes of live and dead cells.
Faster than light propagation.
Certain patterns can appear to move at a speed greater than one cell per generation, but like faster than light phenomena in physics this is illusory.
An example is the "Star Gate", an arrangement of three converging gliders that will mutually annihilate on collision. If a lightweight spaceship (LWSS) hits the colliding gliders, it will appear to move forwards by 11 cells in only 6 generations, and thus travel faster than light. This illusion happens because the glider annihilation reaction proceeds by the creation and soon-after destruction of another LWSS. When the incoming LWSS hits the colliding gliders, it isn't transported, but instead modifies the reaction so that the newly created LWSS can survive. The only signal being transmitted is that determining whether the outgoing LWSS should survive or not. This does not need to reach its destination until after the LWSS has been "transported", and so no information needs to travel faster than light.
Information moves at 2C in kind of a quantum way, in how it moves left and right simultaneously, so a middleman can cause 2 listeners far apart to know what the other has received from the middleman at speed 2C from their perspective, after the 1C time has passed for them both to know the world is set up that way. Consider what could be built with chains of these middlemen crossing eachothers paths.
