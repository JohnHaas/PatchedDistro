Bhopal School of Social Sciences

The Bhopal School of Social Science (popularly known, among the Bhopal crowd as BSSS) is located in the city of lakes, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. BSSS was established in 1972 by the founding chairman of the college, then Archbishop of Bhopal, Dr. Eugene D'souza, in response to the felt need of the time for a broad based, job oriented curriculum with focus on social service and entrepreneurship. Over the course of the past 39 years BSSS has evolved into one of the premier educational institutes of Madhya Pradesh shaping the educational landscape of the state. 
Initially known for its Social Sciences and Management courses, which are indeed its novelty but it grew and diversified to meet the changing needs of time and education, with the introduction of courses in B. Com (Economics, Computers, Foreign Trade, Tourism and Taxation), B.C.A., B.A. and many others. The Undergraduate programmes were further developed with the addition of Post Graduate courses in social work, English literature, Commerce and Business Administration. The college offers an International MBA through collaboration with Assumption University, Bangkok in keeping with our sensitivity to global needs. This is a twinning programme where students do part of their studies at BSSS and go on to complete the programme at The Assumption University. In the present academic year 2008 - 2009 the college has introduced two vocational programmes namely M P Ed and B Ed whereas LLB is in the final stage of approval.
Courses.
Additional Courses.
Bhopal School of Social Sciences has ties with Assumption University, Bangkok for twinning programs in:
Many students have taken advantage of this programme and after doing 6 months of training at BSSS they have attended Assumption University, Bangkok, where they completed their programme. The management and faculty of AU, Bangkok has rated the performance of BSSS students as Good in academics, inter-personal relations, public speaking and extracurricular activities. An effort to consolidate the ties between BSSS and Assumption University was made by sending Dr. Sr. Johnsy, Head Of Department (Commerce) and Dr. Vinay Mishra, Head Of Department (Humanities). The college also hosted guests from Assumption University in the college.
Library.
College has a library with a vast collection of books, journals, periodicals etc. The College library is housed in a separate hall which is spacious, and has a user convenient design. This year, in addition to course related books, the college also took the initiative to add 100 latest bestsellers with a view to enhance learner awareness about contemporary issues, success stories of successful new entrepreneurs and leading business enterprises, thought provoking and motivational books as well as award winning writings in the fiction and non fiction categories. Besides, the audio visual section of the library was enriched with the addition of 42 DVDs on Economics, Management and Commerce related topics including the ALL India Management Association - AIMA - lecture series.
Location.
BSSS is situated on the fringe of the BHEL Township, half a kilometer from the Habibganj Railway station. The strategic location makes it easily accessible from the BHEL Township, Bhopal City as well as the University. It has a spacious campus of , which provides an ideal atmosphere for teaching and learning.

Martin Mahoney

Martin Vincent Mahoney (February 22, 1915 - August 22, 1969) was a Scott County, Minnesota justice of the peace who presided over the initial trial in the case of "First National Bank of Montgomery v. Jerome Daly", Dec. 9, 1968 (Justice Court, Township of Credit River, Scott County, Minnesota), also known as the "Credit River" case. This case has been cited by various conspiracy theorists and anti-Federal Reserve System protesters as authority for the proposition that foreclosure is illegal. According to a statement published at the Minnesota State Law Library web site, the "Credit River" decision is not legal precedent, since it was undertaken by a justice of the peace (see also Subject-matter jurisdiction), and was eventually overruled by other court decisions. The defendant, Jerome Daly, was a longtime tax protester and attorney who was later disbarred by a decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court.
Mahoney died soon after the court case, as reported on page 4 of Vol. III, No.5 of "The Libertarian Forum" in the article "Jerome Daly Once More" published June, 1971, and accessible at http://mises.org/journals/lf/1971/1971_06.pdf.

Kurdybań Warkowicki

Before the 1939 Nazi German and Soviet invasions of Poland Kurdybań Warkowicki or Kurdyban–Warkowicki was a village in Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939) near the town of Warkowicze () in Dubno County, in the eastern part of the Second Polish Republic (now Ukraine).
The village was a site of an OUN-UPA ethnic cleansing operation against the Polish civilians by the Ukrainian Military Group No. 02 called the "Bohun" during the wave of massacres of Poles in Volhynia between 1942 and 1945. The Polish self-defence unit managed to hold its position there until the arrival of the Red Army in 1944. The witnesses consider such survival remarkable with no German outposts and no Polish partisans in its vicinity.
Most Polish self-defence units across the province fell — unable to defend the population against the genocide. Kurdybań Warkowicki was one of the only a handful of surviving units, among them: Młynów, Lubomirka, Klewań, Rokitno, Budki Snowidowickie and Osty.

<doc id="19926373" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19926373" title="Bx-tree">
Bx-tree

In computer science, the Bx tree is a query and update efficient B+ tree-based index structure for moving objects.
Index structure.
The base structure of the Bx-tree is a B+ tree in which the internal nodes serve as a directory, each containing a pointer to its right sibling. In the earlier version of the Bx-tree, the leaf nodes contained the moving-object locations being indexed and corresponding index time. In the optimized version, each leaf node entry contains the id, velocity, single-dimensional mapping value and the latest update time of the object. The fanout is increased by not storing the locations of moving objects, as these can be derived from the mapping values.
Utilize the B+ tree for moving objects.
As for many other moving objects indexes, a 2-dimensional moving object is modeled as a linear function as O = ((x, y), (vx, vy), t ), where (x, y) and (vx, vy) are location and velocity of the object at a given time instance t, i.e., the time of last update. The B+ tree is a structure for indexing single dimensional data. In order to adopt the B+ tree as a moving object index, the Bx-tree uses a linearization technique which helps to integrate objects' location at time t into single dimensional value. Specifically, objects are first partitioned according to their update time. For objects within the same partition, the Bx-tree stores their locations at a given time which are estimated by linear interpolation. By doing so, the Bx-tree keeps a consistent view of all objects within the same partition without storing the update time of an objects. 
Secondly, the space is partitioned by a grid and the location of an object is linearized within the partitions according to a space-filling curve, e.g., the Peano or Hilbert curves. 
Finally, with the combination of the partition number (time information) and the linear order (location information), an object is indexed in Bx-tree with a one dimensional index key Bxvalue:
Here index-partition is an index partition determined by the update time and xrep is the space-filling curve value of the object position at the indexed time, formula_2 denotes the binary value of x, and “+” means concatenation. 
Given an object O ((7, 2), (-0.1,0.05), 10), tmu = 120, the Bxvalue for O can be computed as follows. 
Insertion, Update and Deletion.
Given a new object, its index key is computed and then the object is inserted into the Bx-tree as in the B+ tree. An update consists of a deletion followed by an insertion. An auxiliary structure is employed to keep the latest key of each index so that an object can be deleted by searching for the key. The indexing key is computed before affecting the tree. In this way, the Bx-tree directly inherits the good properties of the B+ tree, and achieves efficient update performance.
Queries.
Range query.
A range query retrieves all objects whose location falls within the rectangular range formula_3 at time formula_4 not prior to the current time.
The Bx-tree uses query-window enlargement technique to answer queries. Since the Bx-tree stores an object's location as of sometime after its update time, the enlargement involves two cases: a location must either be brought back to an earlier time or forward to a later time. The main idea is to enlarge the query window so that it encloses all objects whose positions are not within query window at its label timestamp but will enter the query window at the query timestamp. 
After the enlargement, the partitions of the Bx-tree need to be traversed to find objects falling in the enlarged query window. In each partition, the use of a space-filling curve means that a range query in the native, two-dimensional space becomes a set of range queries in the transformed, one-dimensional space.
To avoid excessively large query region after expansion in skewed datasets, an optimization of the query algorithm exists, which improves the query efficiency by avoiding unnecessary query enlargement. 
K nearest neighbor query.
K nearest neighbor query is computed by iteratively performing range queries with an incrementally enlarged search region until k answers are obtained. Another possibility is to employ similar querying ideas in The iDistance Technique.
Other queries.
The range query and K Nearest Neighbor query algorithms can be easily extended to support interval queries, continuous queries, etc. 
Adapting relational database engines to accommodate moving objects.
Since the Bx-tree is an index built on top of a B+ tree index, all operations in the Bx-tree, including the insertion, deletion and search, are the same as those in the B+ tree. There is no need to change the implementations of these operations. The only difference is to implement the procedure of deriving the indexing key as a stored procedure in an existing DBMS. Therefore the Bx-tree can be easily integrated into existing DBMS without touching the kernel. 
SpADE is moving object management system built on top of a popular relational database system MySQL, which uses the Bx-tree for indexing the objects. In the implementation, moving object data is transformed and stored directly on MySQL, and queries are transformed into standard SQL statements which are efficiently processed in the relational engine. Most importantly, all these are achieved neatly and independently without infiltrating into the MySQL core.
Performance tuning.
Potential problem with data skew.
The Bx tree uses a grid for space partitioning while mapping two-dimensional location into one-dimensional key. This may introduce performance degradation to both query and update operations while dealing with skewed data. If grid cell is oversize, many objects are contained in a cell. Since objects in a cell are indistinguishable to the index, there will be some overflow nodes in the underlying B+ tree. The existing of overflow pages not only destroys the balancing of the tree but also increases the update cost. As for the queries, for the given query region, large cell incurs more false positives and increases the processing time. On the other hand, if the space is partitioned with finer grid, i.e. smaller cells, each cell contains few objects. There is hardly overflow pages so that the update cost is minimized. Fewer false positives are retrieved in a query. However, more cells are needed to be searched. The increase in the number of cells searched also increases the workload of a query. 
Index tuning.
The ST2B-tree introduces a self-tuning framework for tuning the performance of the Bx-tree while dealing with data skew in space and data change with time. In order to deal with data skew in space, the ST2B-tree splits the entire space into regions of different object density using a set of reference points. Each region uses an individual grid whose cell size is determined by the object density inside of it. 
The Bx-tree have multiple partitions regarding different time intervals. As time elapsed, each partition grows and shrinks alternately. The ST2B-tree utilizes this feature to tune the index online in order to adjust the space partitioning to make itself accommodate to the data changes with time. In particular, as a partition shrinks to empty and starts growing, it chooses a new set of reference points and new grid for each reference point according to the latest data density. The tuning is based on the latest statistics collected during a given period of time, so that the way of space partitioning is supposed to fit the latest data distribution best. By this means, the ST2B-tree is expected to minimize the effect caused by data skew in space and data changes with time.

Ixtlán de Juárez

Ixtlán de Juárez is a town and municipality in the Mexican state of Oaxaca about 65 km north of the city of Oaxaca on Federal Highway 175 towards Veracruz.
It is part of the Ixtlán District in the Sierra Norte de Oaxaca region.
Administrative areas.
Municipality of Ixtlán.
The municipality of Ixtlán de Juárez includes the town, and in addition the settlements of San Juan Yagila, Santa Cruz Yagavila, Santa María Yahuiche, Santa María Zoogochi, Santiago Teotlasco, Santo Domingo Cacalotepec, San Gaspar Yagalaxi, San Miguel Tiltepec, Santa María Josaa, La Luz, La Josefina and La Palma. The population of the town in the 2005 census was 2,479, and of the entire municipality, 7,188. Other than the town of Ixtlán, none of the settlements have as many as a thousand inhabitants.
Rincón de Ixtlán.
The Rincón de Ixtlán is an area largely within the municipality of Ixtlán de Juárez. It comprises nine communities, eight of them within the municipality of Ixtlán (the ninth, San Pedro Yaneri, is a small independent municipality). The Rincón does not include the town of Ixtlán or other communities on the main road. This remote and culturally homogeneous area is one of the most intensely indigenous in the whole of Mexico, and has therefore been the subject of considerable sociological study 
History.
The town of Ixtlán existed before the Spanish Conquest of Mexico. It is thought to have been founded in the latter half of the 15th century, by Zapotec people from the region around Tarabundi and San Pedro Laduu (though there are also neolithic remains in the area). The first settlers were probably warriors establishing a defensive outpost against Aztec invaders. In 1859 Ixtlán was the site of a battle during the Reform War between liberal and conservative forces. Some of the other communities in the municipality are probably several centuries older than the town of Ixtlán 
San Pablo Guelatao, the birthplace of Benito Juárez, lies 4 km from the town of Ixtlán and at the time of his birth fell within its jurisdiction, so Juárez was baptised in the church of St Thomas in Ixtlán; hence his name has been added to that of the town (in 1824, however, Guelatao declared itself independent of Ixtlán, and it remains an independent municipality). The addition of Juárez's name serves the additional purpose of distinguishing the town from the many other Ixtláns in Mexico: the name is usually claimed to come from Aztec words meaning "land of the maguey", and use of the maguey (otherwise known as the century plant) was widespread in pre-Columbian Mexico. An alternative proposed derivation is from Mixtec words meaning "place of obsidian", and the town uses a logo that depicts an object made of obsidian.
Economy.
Ixtlán is now a centre for eco-tourism. Its location, surrounded by cloud forest and pine and oak woodlands (which are forested sustainably) gives it great natural landscape beauty, and the forests of the Sierra Juárez mountains are claimed to be home to around 500 bird species and 6000 plant species. 
Tours are operated from the village, and accommodation is available. 
Hiking trails link it to neighbouring towns and villages in the Sierra Norte. It is accessible by the bus service that connects Oaxaca and Veracruz along Federal Highway 175. The land is held in common, but for a time in the late 20th century, a Mexican national paper manufacturer held a concession to harvest its forests. However when the concession expired, the local communities denied the company any extensions and the forests are now managed communally in order to ensure that they are sustainable.
Principal agricultural crops in the municipality of Ixtlán are maize and coffee, with a small amount of land given over to sugarcane and other crops. Fair trade marketing has made a substantial difference to the coffee growers in this area.
Higher education.
As a rural mountainous region, higher education had previously not been readily available to the populace. In April 2005 the government of the state of Oaxaca established the Universidad de la Sierra Juárez to help further the development and education of citizens in the Sierra Norte region. Currently the university offers degrees in the fields of natural sciences, sociology and humanities. UNSIJ also encourages four core academic activities among its students, including: teaching, research, cultural enrichment, and promotion of regional development.

List of Royal Air Force air chief marshals

The following is a list of Royal Air Force air chief marshals. The rank of air chief marshal is a four-star officer rank and currently the highest rank to which RAF officers may be promoted to in a professional capacity. Throughout the history of the RAF there have been 140 RAF officers promoted to air chief marshal and at present two RAF officers hold the rank in an active capacity, namely the Chief of the Air Staff (the only dedicated RAF 4-star post) and the Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff (the only tri-service 4-star post currently occupied by an air chief marshal).
The rank was first used in 1922 when Sir Hugh Trenchard the then Chief of the Air Staff was promoted. Up until the mid-1930s there was usually only one RAF officer in the rank of air chief marshal. During World War II, with the great expansion of the RAF, the number of air chief marshals active at any one time rose to six by the end of the War. This number of air chief marshals was to remain approximately constant throughout the Cold War but after the British defence cuts of the mid-1990s there were only two dedicated 4-star RAF posts, namely the AOC-in-C, Strike Command and the Chief of the Air Staff. In 2007 with the reduction to a single command (Air Command) the RAF initially retained two air chief marshal posts (the AOC-in-C, Air Command and the Chief of the Air Staff) but in 2012 the post of AOC-in-C, Air Command was subsumed within the responsibilities of the Chief of the Air Staff leaving only a single dedicated RAF air chief marshal post.

The Main Event Mafia

The Main Event Mafia (occasionally abbreviated to MEM) was a stable in the professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Starting in 2008, the group included leader Kurt Angle, Sting (who had temporarily led the Main Event Mafia before being ousted), Kevin Nash (with winner Jenna Morasca), Booker T (with his real-life wife Sharmell), Scott Steiner, Samoa Joe, and Traci Brooks. All the male members of the stable were multiple time world heavyweight champions of multiple companies, TNA included, with extensive experience in main event matches. The MEM at one time held all the male titles TNA had to offer, with unsuccessful aspirations to acquire TNA's women's championships as well.
The group formed in late 2008 and had since been largely successful, with Sting and Kurt Angle being TNA World Heavyweight Champions, Booker T introducing a new championship into TNA called the TNA Legends Championship and declaring himself the first official champion with Kevin Nash going on to win the belt as well and Booker T and Scott Steiner holding the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The group's formation was the result of TNA introducing a new storyline in which the veterans began a rivalry with younger talent within the company who called themselves The TNA Front Line; with the MEM being the villains of the storyline as the veterans modelling themselves after the mafia, portrayed as being upset at the disrespect being shown by the younger wrestlers.
In June 2013, Sting announced the return of the Main Event Mafia, now as a heroic stable, in response to a year-long war between the TNA roster and the Aces & Eights. The group includes past members of the original Mafia (Sting, Kurt Angle, and Samoa Joe) and new members Magnus and Quinton "Rampage" Jackson.
History.
Background.
In the summer of 2008 at TNA's July pay-per-view Victory Road during a bout between the fan favorite Samoa Joe and villainous Booker T for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, Joe went on a storyline rampage and attacked referees, security, and Booker T without on-screen mercy. Sting, who was also a fan favorite, then entered the arena and stopped Joe's assault, however, Joe gave Sting the middle finger and continued his assault on Booker T. This angered Sting to a point in which he grabbed Joe and hit him with a baseball bat, which he held in his hand thus, turning Heel in the process. Following the event, Sting did not appear on TNA's primary television program TNA Impact! in a wrestling role or to explain his actions at the event, instead he was only seen standing in the rafters on each episode. As a result of Sting's actions at the event, a storyline within the company began that saw a possible alliance between Booker T and Sting.
It began on the July 31 episode of "Impact!", while Joe was brawling with Booker T, a baseball bat fell from the ceiling hanging by a wire; Booker T grabbed it and smashed Joe over the back with it. At TNA's August pay-per-view Hard Justice, Sting attacked A.J. Styles, an on-screen ally of Joe's, after Styles had just attacked Kurt Angle following their encounter. The reasons Sting's actions were eventually revealed on the August 14 episode of "Impact!", in which he stated that he attacked Joe and Styles because they were not showing respect for veterans such as Angle and Booker T by doing what they did at the events. Sting being a veteran of the sport himself went on to say when he was Styles' and Joe's age, if he had a match with a veteran, he pinned and walked away, not adding insult to injury by trying to end their careers, like Styles and Joe were trying to do. This sparked a rivalry between the three, which later involved Angle and Booker T.
At TNA's September pay-per-view No Surrender, Sting announced that at TNA's October pay-per-view Bound for Glory IV, he would challenge Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship; later in the event during a match between Christian Cage, Angle, and Joe, Jeff Jarrett made his on-screen return to the promotion after not being seen in TNA since late May 2007, by siding with and helping Joe retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Jarrett went on to Bound for Glory to defeat Angle in a standard match with Mick Foley as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer. Also at Bound for Glory, Sting defeated Joe after Kevin Nash struck Joe with a baseball bat while the referee wasn't looking to allow Sting to take the advantage and pin Joe after a Scorpion Death Drop. Nash's actions were explained on the October 16 episode of "Impact!", when he said that Joe disrespected him and his long-time real-life friend Scott Hall in late 2007 when Joe insulted Hall for not showing up at TNA's December pay-per-view Turning Point.
Feud with TNA Frontline (2008 – 2009).
The group officially joined together on the October 23 episode of "Impact!", in a segment between Nash, Booker T, Angle, Sting, and Jeremy Borash, where Angle announced that the four had joined together to form a group of legends called The Main Event Mafia. The goal of the group was to start a "war" against the younger talent to take what they deserved: respect. The following week, they added Scott Steiner to the Mafia as he made his return from an injury and attacked Joe, Styles, and their allies. Steiner notably spared using his lead pipe on his protégé, Petey Williams, who backed off as soon as he saw him.
At Turning Point, Booker T successfully defeated Christian Cage to retain the Legends Championship. As per the stipulation, Cage was forced to join the MEM, however, the MEM attacked Cage and kicked him out of the group because they believed he was leaving TNA (later proven to be true). MEM proceeded to go on a rampage, assaulting Brother Ray, Samoa Joe, Petey Williams (Steiner doing the deed, finally severing the ties between the two), B.G. James, Rhino, Jeff Jarrett and A.J. Styles, injuring all in their "hits." At Genesis, Kevin Nash could not make it to the event due to a legitimate staph infection in his left elbow. When it came time for his tag team match, Booker T announced that they had found a suitable replacement in Kip James. Kip was not intended to be a long-term addition to the team, as he quickly disappeared from the main event scene as the original five members of the Main Event Mafia resumed their positions. At Destination X, Booker T lost the Legends Championship to A.J. Styles while Sting retained the TNA World title against Angle with Jeff Jarrett as the special guest referee and Mick Foley was the Special Guest enforcer. At Lockdown, Sting lost the TNA World Heavyweight title to Mick Foley and the rest of the Main Event Mafia (Nash, Steiner, Booker T and Angle) lost to Team Jarrett, which consisted of Jeff Jarrett, Samoa Joe, A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels. At Sacrifice, Sting pinned Angle in an Ultimate Sacrifice match also involving Mick Foley and Jeff Jarrett to become the new Godfather of the Main Event Mafia. Sting immediately made his new leadership felt, as on the May 28, 2009, edition of "Impact!", he dismissed Sharmell, Jenna Morasca and Angle's security men Big Rocco and Sally Boy from the alliance as part of his new leadership. Rocco and Sally promptly signed on to be Mick Foley's security the following week.
Heading into Slammiversary, Matt Morgan expressed his wishes to join the Mafia. This would lead to Angle facing Morgan in a singles match on "Impact!" which Angle would win. After the match Angle shook Morgan's hand showing that he would want him in the Mafia. On the following weeks "Impact!" during a King of the Mountain qualification match between Angle and Sting, Morgan interfered helping Angle win. After the match Angle gave out to Morgan for helping him win. Morgan would go on and ask Sting to let him become a member of the Mafia. Sting agreed to a match at Slammiversary between Morgan where if Morgan won he could join the group. Sting went on to defeat Morgan at the pay-per-view. In the final match of the pay-per-view, Angle won the King of the Mountain match to win the World Title after Samoa Joe helped him, thus rendering Joe a heel and the newest member of the Mafia, also betraying the TNA Front Line. On the June 25 edition of "Impact!", it was explained that Joe was invested into and paid by the Mafia to join them due to being unable to defeat him. The Mafia as well as Morgan attacked Sting in disapproval of his leadership, with Angle claiming to once again become the leader of the Mafia. The following week, Sting saved A.J. Styles from a beatdown from his former stable mates, attacking each member of the Mafia with his baseball bat and stealing Angle's TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The following week, Sting confronted Samoa Joe, claiming to unveil Joe's mystery adviser before Victory Road, where he would be facing Samoa Joe. Later on in the show, Sting disguised himself as Joe and nearly dragged out Joe's adviser from his car, before Joe stopped him, choking him out with the Coquina Clutch and his signature tribal knife. Joe then took back the World Championship, returning it to Angle during the beatdown on Mick Foley at the end of the show. At Victory Road, The Mafia gained all power in TNA as Nash won the Legends Championship from A.J. Styles to bring the title back to the Mafia. At the same event, Booker and Steiner defeated Beer Money, Inc. for the World Tag Team Championship, Angle defeated Foley to retain the World Heavyweight Title and Taz was also revealed to be Joe's adviser; Taz would later state that he was just an ally of the MEM. On the July 30 episode of Impact! Kevin Nash lost the Legends Championship to Mick Foley in a tag team match with Kurt Angle against Bobby Lashley and Mick Foley.
World Elite and dissolution (2009).
On the August 6 episode of Impact! it was revealed the Main Event Mafia (M.E.M.) would join forces with World Elite, a stable consisting of Eric Young, Sheik Abdul Bashir, Kiyoshi, Brutus Magnus, Doug Williams and Rob Terry to form a super faction. At Hard Justice the Main Event Mafia further solidified their dominance with Kevin Nash regaining the Legends Championship, Samoa Joe winning the X Division Championship, and Booker T, Scott Steiner, and Kurt Angle retaining the World Tag Team and World Heavyweight Championships. By Hard Justice 2009, the Main Event Mafia controlled every male championship in TNA. At No Surrender Angle lost the World Heavyweight Championship to A.J. Styles. On the October 1 edition of "Impact!" the alliance between Main Event Mafia and World Elite came to an end in an all out brawl between the two factions. The following week Joe lost the X Division Championship to Amazing Red after Bobby Lashley interfered in the match. Main Event Mafia's Championship match losing streak continued at Bound for Glory where Nash lost the Legends title to World Elite leader Eric Young and Booker and Steiner lost the TNA World Tag Team titles to Doug Williams and Brutus Magnus, also of the World Elite. At the same PPV Angle narrowly defeated long-time foe Matt Morgan and afterwards shook his hand. On the following edition of "Impact!" the stable's future was thrown into question, when Booker was announced as having left the company and Angle admitted that he had been wrong all along about the younger talent of the company and praised the likes of A.J. Styles and Matt Morgan, thus becoming a face. However, Scott Steiner still wore the Main Event Mafia clothing and said that the group was still alive as long as he was involved and that he did not take orders from Kurt Angle. He still maintained that the young talent did not show respect to the veterans of the professional wrestling business. However, in February 2010, Steiner left TNA, effectively ending the Main Event Mafia.
Abandoned return (2011).
In January 2011 TNA started a storyline aiming to bring back the Main Event Mafia as a face group on the February 3, 2011, edition of "Impact!" to feud with Immortal. Scott Steiner returned to the promotion on the January 27 edition of "Impact!" and aligned himself with Kurt Angle, but on January 30, Booker T and Kevin Nash instead made surprise returns to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) to compete at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, forcing TNA to change their plans and abandon the storyline.
New Main Event Mafia (2013).
On the June 13, 2013 episode of "Impact Wrestling", Sting announced the return of a new "Main Event Mafia" to face the Aces & Eights after the beat down of Slammiversary XI. On June 20, 2013 the first member of the "New Main Event Mafia" was revealed to be Kurt Angle. On the tapings of the June 27th episode of Impact Wrestling, Samoa Joe was revealed as the next member as he aided after Sting and Angle attacked Aces & Eights to help Samoa Joe defeat Mr. Anderson in a submission victory in his second Bound For Glory Series bout. On the July 4 episode of "Impact", Magnus was revealed to be the fourth member, as nominated by Samoa Joe because as of the time of the announcement, Magnus was leading the Bound for Glory series, but also the fact that they had fought alongside and against each other many times. In the main event between Chris Sabin, Austin Aries, and Manik the Main Event Mafia was stationed at ringside to prevent Aces & Eights from getting involved. After Chris Sabin won the match the Mafia congratulated Sabin on the win and appeared to back him up. On July 11 episode of Impact Wrestling, Quinton "Rampage" Jackson was announced as the fifth member. On August 22 episode of "Impact", due to Kurt Angle taking a hiatus on August 2 to go into rehab for (legit) alcohol use, A.J. Styles took his place as the fifth member of the team and helped pin Devon in the 5-on-5 tag match, making Devon leave TNA. On "No Surrender" on September 12, Hulk Hogan announced that Bellator MMA had pulled Rampage Jackson and Tito Ortiz from TNA programming due to their upcoming PPV fight, thus removing Jackson from MEM. In the main event of the night, Magnus lost the BFG Series finals to A.J. Styles. During his match, EGO interfered. Due to this, Magnus started a feud with EGO. After losing to EGO, MEM trio of Sting, Magnus and Joe engaged in different storylines. At BFG, Magnus defeated Sting. On October 31 edition of "Impact Wrestling" Magnus won a gauntlet match by eliminating Sting to be in the TNA World Title Tournament. On the following edition of "Impact Wrestling", MEM announced that their mission was accomplished and they parted ways with Sting saying he was going to teach the wrestlers who think that the business owes them something a lesson and Joe, Magnus, and Angle wanting to become TNA World Heavyweight Champion.

Costero

The costero ("Sotalia guianensis") is a dolphin found in the coastal waters to the north and east of South America, and east of Central America. The common name "costero" has been suggested by Caballero and colleagues due to the species' affinity for coastal habitats. It is also known as the Guyana dolphin. The costero is a member of the oceanic dolphin family (Delphinidae). Physically, it resembles the bottlenose dolphin. However, it and its close freshwater relative the tucuxi differ sufficiently from the bottlenose dolphin to be placed in a separate genus, "Sotalia". 
Description.
The costero is frequently described as looking similar to the bottlenose dolphin. However, it is typically smaller, at only up to 2.1 m (6.9 ft) in length. The dolphin is colored light to bluish grey on its back and sides. The ventral region is light gray. The dorsal fin is typically slightly hooked. The beak is well-defined and of moderate length.
Researchers have recently shown that the costero has an electroreceptive sense, and speculate this may also be the case for other toothed whales.
Taxonomy.
Although described as species distinct from the tucuxi "Sotalia fluviatilis" by Pierre-Joseph van Bénéden in 1864, the costero "Sotalia guianensis" has subsequently been synonymized with "Sotalia fluviatilis" with the two species being treated as subspecies, or marine and freshwater varieties. The first to reassert differences between these two species was a three-dimensional morphometric study of Monteiro-Filho and colleagues. Subsequently a molecular analysis by Cunha and colleagues unambiguously demonstrated that "Sotalia guianensis" was genetically differentiated from "Sotalia fluviatilis". This finding was reiterated by Caballero and colleagues with a larger number of genes. The existence of two species has been generally accepted by the scientific community; however, the IUCN still treats both as a single species, "Sotalia fluviatilis".
Distribution.
The costero is found close to estuaries, inlets and other protected shallow-water areas around the eastern and northern South American coast. It has been reported as far south as southern Brazil and north as far as Nicaragua. One report exists of an animal reaching Honduras.
Behavior.
This species forms small groups of about 10-15 individuals, occasionally up to 30, and swim in tight-knit groups, suggesting a highly developed social structure. They are quite active and may jump clear of the water (a behavior known as breaching), somersault, spy-hop or tail-splash. They are unlikely, however, to approach boats. They feed on a wide variety of fish. Studies of growth layers suggest the species can live up to 30 years.
In December 2006, researchers from the Southern University of Chile and the Rural Federal University of Rio de Janeiro witnessed attempted infanticide by a group of costero dolphins in Sepetiba Bay, Brazil. A group of six adults separated a mother from her calf, four then keeping her at bay by ramming her and hitting her with their flukes. The other two adults rammed the calf, held it under water, then threw it into the air and held it under water again. The mother was seen again in a few days, but not her calf. Since females become sexually receptive within a few days of losing a calf, and the group of attacking males was sexually interested in the female, it is possible that the infanticide occurred for this reason. Infanticide has been reported twice before in bottlenose dolphins, but is thought to be generally uncommon among cetaceans.
Conservation.
The costero appears to be relatively common; however, it gets frequently entangled in nets of the coastal fishing fleets. An estimated at least 2,000 animals are killed by entanglement per year in the Amazon River delta region. Many of these animals are used as shark fishing bait, and their organs are sold as fetishes. Another major problem in some areas is collisions with boats. Possible natural predators are the orca and the bull shark.
The Guiana dolphin is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

Louis, Prince of Anhalt-Pless

Louis of Anhalt-Pless (16 July 1783 in Pless – 5 November 1841 in Pless), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Pless.
He was the sixth (but fifth surviving) son of Frederick Erdmann, Prince of Anhalt-Pless, by his wife Louise Ferdinande, daughter of Henry Ernest, Count of Stolberg-Wernigerode.
Life.
As the youngest child in his family, Louis had little prospect of ever taking part the government of Pless; but when the main line of the Anhalt-Köthen branch of the House of Ascania became extinct in 1818, his older brother Frederick Ferdinand assumed the title duke of Anhalt-Köthen and left the government of Pless in the hands of the next oldest brother, Henry.
In 1830, Frederick Ferdinand died childless and Henry succeeded him as duke. Shortly after, he left the government of Pless in the hands of Louis. Because Henry was also childless, Louis became heir presumptive to the duchy of Anhalt-Köthen until his death, unmarried and also childless. After Louis's death, Henry reassumed his government over Pless until his own death.

WRIV

WRIV (1390 AM) is a radio station licensed to Riverhead, New York and serves eastern Long Island. It broadcasts an Adult Standards format.
The station, which has been owned since 1987 by Crystal Coast Communications, has daytime power of 1,000 Watts and 64 Watts at night.
History.
The station went on the air on June 20, 1955 as a sister station to WALK and WALK-FM radio in Patchogue, New York. Its studio at 29 East Main Street burned within six months in what is listed by the Riverhead Fire Department as one of the worst fires in the town's history.
In 1963 it was sold to Island Broadcasting System with its sister stations, WALK AM & FM. Island Broadcasting was owned in part by NBC News anchorman Chet Huntley. In 1967, WRIV applied for a television license for Channel 55. WRIV-TV, which likely would have gone to air as the NBC affiliate for eastern Long Island, held a commercial permit for the station until the early 1970s. The Channel 55 allocation was dormant until WLIG-TV went on the air in 1985; today Channel 55 is known as WLNY-TV and is owned by CBS.
WRIV was sold again in 1981 to East End Communications and was sister station to now defunct WGLI/1290 in Babylon before being sold to its current owners.
WRIV is the only commercial AM radio station in the five east end towns of Long Island. It maintains an Adult Standards/Information format and has local personalities. The station is an affiliate of the ABC Information Network.
Other personalities on the station over the years include Ted Brown (following the demise of WNEW), well-known voice over talent Ed Marshall and former WALK morning personality Bob Klein.

Phengaris

Phengaris is a genus of gossamer-winged butterflies in the subfamily Polyommatinae. Commonly, these butterflies are called large blues, which if referring to a particular species is "P. arion", a species resident in Europe and some parts of Asia.
"Phengaris" nowadays includes the genus Maculinea. The type species of the latter was the Alcon Blue (""M." alcon"), which is less closely related to most of the other supposed members of "Maculinea" than the old "Phengaris" species are, and hence the two genera are merged to form a monophyletic group. Alternatively, "Maculinea" could be restricted to the one or two species of "alcon" blues, and the rest of it be separated as a new genus. But this would mean to maintain two very small genera, which is generally avoided by modern taxonomists. As "Phengaris" is the older name, it thus replaces "Maculinea".
"Maculinea" was alternatively considered to be a subgenus of "Glaucopsyche". But while "Glaucopsyche" and "Phengaris" (including "Maculinea") are certainly close relatives, they are unlikely to be that close.
The most recently discovered species in the genus is "P. xiushani", first reported in 2010 and found in undisturbed forested mountains, unlike all the other members which live in grasslands over their entire range of distribution.
Species.
The species, listed in the presumed phylogenetic sequence from the most ancestral to the most apomorphic, are:
Basal group ("Maculinea sensu stricto")
Phengaris sensu stricto
Other ""Maculinea""

Paul Bannon

Paul Anthony Bannon (born 15 November 1956) is an Irish former professional footballer who played most of his career as a centre forward, moving to centre half for his last few years in the League of Ireland. Bannon played in England, Wales, the Netherlands, Greece and Ireland, making over 200 career appearances.
Career.
Bannon was born in Dublin, the son of Tipperary senior inter-county hurler, three-time All-Ireland title winner, Séamus Bannon. Bannon played for Nottingham Forest, Bridgend Town, Carlisle United, Darlington, Bristol Rovers, Cardiff City, Plymouth Argyle, NAC Breda, PAOK, Larissa, Cork City and Cobh Ramblers.
Bannon spent the 1987–88 Alpha Ethniki season with PAOK F.C. He played 20 matches and scored nine league goals, which made him the club's joint top scorer. At the end of the season, he moved on to Greek champions Larissa. Their first foray into the European Cup was soon over. In the first round of the 1988–89 European Cup, they were drawn against Neuchâtel Xamax of Switzerland. They overcame the Swiss 2–1 in the first leg, but fell to the same scoreline away. The match went to penalties, and Larissa lost 3–0 with Bannon missing the second kick. Bannon finished the league season with three goals from 11 appearances, and then returned home to Ireland.
He made his League of Ireland debut for Cork City on 3 September 1989, the opening day of the 1989–90 season, against Drogheda United. Signed as a centre forward, Bannon went back to centre half because of Cork's injury problems, and he was playing in that position when he scored his first league goal, against Dundalk at Oriel Park on 5 November 1989. Former Cork player and manager Dave Barry included Bannon as a defender in his all-time Cork City eleven, selected in 2004.
Bannon played in Cork's first ever European game, against Torpedo Moscow in the 1989–90 European Cup Winners' Cup. Despite suffering from a virus, he played as the lone striker, and had Cork's only two chances – one header over the bar, one saved – as they lost 5–0 in Moscow. Bannon also played twice against Bayern Munich in the 1991–92 UEFA Cup. Overall he made four appearances for Cork in Europe.
Bannon scored the only goal of the semi-final, against St Patrick's Athletic, to put Cork through to the 1992 FAI Cup Final. They lost 1–0 to Bohemians. In his last game for Cork, he scored the winning goal to win the 1992–93 League of Ireland title at the RDS Arena.
He finished his playing career with Cobh Ramblers, and then assisted Mick Conroy with the running of a youth academy in Cork. Successful graduates include Ireland internationals Colin Healy, Damien Delaney and Liam Miller.

Fred Forbát

Alfréd "Fred" Forbát (31 March 1897 – 22 May 1972) was a Hungarian-born architect with significant work in Germany and Sweden.
He was born to Jewish parents in Pécs, former Austria-Hungary (today part of the Republic of Hungary). He studied architecture and art history at the University of Budapest and the Technical University of Munich. From 1920–22 Forbát worked with Walter Gropius and was a lecturer at the Bauhaus in its first incarnation, in Weimar. (According to Willett, at least, Forbát and his wife had been deported by the Bavarian government.) Forbát was the one who encouraged and recommended the school to his fellow Hungarian Marcel Breuer. After a short time in independent practice, he served from 1925–28 as chief architect of Berlin's contractor and promoter Adolf Sommerfeld. In 1926 he joined The Ring . 
In 1929-1931 he was the co-designer, with Walter Gropius, Otto Bartning, Hugo Haring and Paul Rudolf Henning, of the Ringsiedlung Siemensstadt Housing Project, Berlin-Charlottenburg-Nord, Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. (His contributions are Goebelstrasse 2-10, and Geisserpfad 11-19.) In 1930 he designed the Mommsenstadion in Berlin-Charlottenburg. In 1928 Forbát received a commission from the Russian government to build communal housing for foreign civil engineers. This was never built, but the commission led to Forbát's move to the U.S.S.R. in 1933 where he joined the so-called May Brigade, associated with Ernst May a group of Social Democratic architects exiled from Germany and promised vast amounts of urban-planning work for the emerging Soviet Union, work that never quite materialized. By some accounts Forbát contributed to May's ill-fated super-plan for Magnitogorsk. 
In 1938 he briefly returned to Hungary as a free-lance architect, and was responsible for a number of tenements and free-standing houses there. Later that same year he traveled to Stockholm, where he began a long term association. He worked for the Urban Ministry, then became a member of the Stadtplanungskommitee "Eglers Stadsplanebyrå". He was partly responsible for master plans for Skövde (1949), Landskrona (1951), Kullabygden (1959), Linköping (1967) and Kristinehamn. In 1952 Forbát was co-organizer of the 1952 special (non-congress) meeting of CIAM in Sigtuna (Sweden), and also helped organize the 1957 Interbau project in Berlin. His papers are held by the Swedish Museum of Architecture in Stockholm. He died in Vällingby, Sweden in 1972, aged 75.

Pycnophallium

Pycnophallium is a genus-level name in the butterfly family Lycaenidae. The genus name was erected by the Dutch Lepidopterist Toxopeus in 1929. He included two Oriental species under this name: "roxus" and "elna" . These species had previously been treated as species in the genera "Lycaena" or "Castalius" until Fruhstorfer erected "Caleta" in 1922. Although "Caleta" in the wide sense has not been fully revised since Fruhstorfer erected it, , 1992 [http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110004789037/en], made an authoritative classification of Oriental Polyommatine genera. Hirowatari did not recognise "Pycnophallium" as a valid genus, but retained 9 species, including "roxus" and "elna" in "Caleta".

Rapala (butterfly)

Rapala is a genus of butterfly in the tribe Deudorigini of the subfamily Theclinae of the family Lycaenidae. They are found throughout the Oriental Region, with a few species extending to Australia and into the Eastern Palaearctic Region.
Males of "Rapala" are differentiated from other genera in the Deudorigini by the genitalia, with the conjoined valvae tapering evenly to rounded apices. The male secondary sexual characters also differ. In every species there is a brand above the origin of vein 7 and lying wholly within space 7, clothed with very small scent scales, and nearly always there is an associated erectile hair tuft on the forewing dorsum beneath.
Almost all species exhibit sexual dimorphism in the colour of the upperside; normally the male is red, reddish brown or deep blue, while the female is dark brown or pale purple blue.

Altogether (album)

Altogether is a greatest hits album released by pop group, The Nolans in 1982.
Following a successful run in the UK Charts, lasting between 1979 and 1982, "Altogether" was the first hits compilation released by The Nolans. It featured their seven consecutive top 20 hits and followed four top 20 albums by the group. The album was released at the beginning of the group's decline in the UK, and the lead single, "Dragonfly" failed to chart. This song was a departure for the group, with it not being produced by either of their regular producers, Ben Findon or Nicky Graham, but by Tim Friese-Greene, who was responsible for the recent success of Tight Fit. The album itself also fared less well than expected when it peaked at No.52. It was also at this time that the group were back to being a five-piece, with the return of former member, Anne Nolan.
This was the last Nolans album released by Epic Records, and their final single with them came the following year. The follow-up album, "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun", was released in 1984 on another label and restored the group to a slightly higher level as it reached No.39, but this proved to be The Nolans' last gasp in the UK.

Spindasis

Spindasis is a genus of butterfly in the family Lycaenidae, which Eliot, 1973, places in the tribe Aphnaeini of the Sub-Family Lycaeninae. The butterflies are easily recognised by the silvery markings on the underside and the two hindwing tails, of which the one at vein 1b is longer.
Spindasis was synonymised with the older genus Cigaritis Donzel, by Heath "et al", 2002, and this synonymy is followed in Williams Afrotropical Lycaenidae. Hence, this page is redundant and a more complete species list is included under "Cigaritis".

Thereus

__NOTOC__
Thereus is a genus of gossamer-winged butterflies (family Lycaenidae). Among these, it belongs belong to the tribe Eumaeini of the subfamily Theclinae. These small butterflies occur essentially all over the Neotropics.
Classification.
Though this genus was first proposed long ago, for much of the time "Thereus" was included in the "wastebin genus" "Thecla". However, the two genera are not particularly close relatives among their subfamily. In recent times, it has been proposed to remove several species from "Thereus" to smaller or even monotypic genera. While this might be warranted in some cases, it is not followed here pending more thorough study.
The junior synonyms of "Thereus" are thus:
Species.
The following named species are placed in "Thereus" at present:
In addition, a number of as yet undescribed butterflies are suspected to belong here too:

<doc id="19927106" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19927106" title="Theritas">
Theritas

Theritas is a genus of gossamer-winged butterflies (family Lycaenidae) found in the Neotropics. Among the tribe Eumaeini of its subfamily Theclinae, it is usually placed in the group around the genus "Atlides". In particular, it seems most closely related to "Arcas".
Description.
"Theritas" species are large among the Eumaeini but altogether still smallish butterflies. They typically have a pennant-like hindwing "tail" which projects outwards at an approximate right angle from the squared-off edge of the tapered tornal area. A smaller tail is located slightly more forward on the hindwing. The upperwings of these butterflies are largely or entirely colored brilliant blue. But these traits – as opposed to the androconia pouches discussed below – are also found in several other Eumaeini, which have been included in this genus but do not really appear to belong here.
Like "Arcas", they have androconia (scent scales) on the hindwing upperside near the base of the cubital vein; these are autapomorphically tucked away in a flat deep pouch in space 1b between the wing veins. Some species also have androconia on the forewings, but it needs to be clarified whether these are indeed "Theritas sensu stricto". The hindwing underside is brownish in these butterflies, with a subbasal line running between the subcosta and the anal vein branch of the cubital vein. This genus has some sexual dichromatism in that the males show green iridescence of the blue upperwing color. By comparison, "Arcas" has golden-green hindwing undersides dusted with black, with a black band running roughly parallel to the distal wing margin, longer tails, and lacks sexual dichromatism. The female genitals have a long, straight and tubular genital duct with a plain anal end in the type species "T. mavors", but variation within the genus is insufficiently studied.
Species.
There have been 2 major competing taxonomic schemes for this genus in the late 20th century. The traditional view delimits the genus loosely, with about 30 species. A more recent proposal restricts the genus to 6-8 valid species, which all possess the typical apomorphies and can be divided into three species-groups or superspecies:
"mavors" group
"paupera" group
"triquetra" group
Provisionally placed here.
A number of species are usually placed in "Theritas", but apparently will have to be split off if the genus is to be a monophyletic group. ""T." anna" for example might be closer to "Brangas" and "Evenus" or even belong in the latter, while ""T." deniva" and some allies could just as well be closer to "Micandra" and "Penaincisalia" than to "Theritas" proper. All in all, it is not unlikely that some of the genera nowadays considered junior synonyms of "Theritas" turn out to be valid. Several of the proposed genera are monotypic, and thus perhaps least likely to be valid. One of these has been argued to be "nomen nudum" per Article 13.1 of the ICZN Code, because an appropriate genus description was not given; the matter has been submitted to the ICZN for discussion. That all nonwithstanding, species provisionally placed in "Theritas" are:
In addition, there are at least three more undescribed species placed here: one from Santa Catarina state in Brazil and two from the Andes of Peru. It is unknown whether they are indeed "Theritas" "sensu stricto". "T. drucei" and "T. triquetra" as well as some species of the disputed assemblage are known from Santa Catarina or its surroundings, while the rest of the "paupera" group but also many other related Lycaenidae are found in the Andes.

Tourism in Bangkok

Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, is one of the world's top tourist destination cities. MasterCard ranked Bangkok as the global top destination city by international visitor arrivals in its Global Destination Cities Index, with 15.98 million projected visitors in 2013. The city is ranked fourth in cross-border spending, with 14.3 billion dollars projected for 2013, after New York, London and Paris. Euromonitor International ranked Bangkok sixth in its Top City Destinations Ranking for 2011. Bangkok has also been named "World's Best City" by "Travel + Leisure" magazine's survey of its readers for three consecutive years since 2010.
As the main gateway through which visitors arrive in Thailand, Bangkok is visited by the majority of international tourists to the country. Domestic tourism is also prominent. The Department of Tourism recorded 26,861,095 Thai and 11,361,808 foreign visitors to Bangkok in 2010. Lodgings were made by 15,031,244 guests, who occupied 49.9 percent of the city's 86,687 hotel rooms. Chinese visitors spend a lot of money and most goes to retailers in Bangkok. Chinese visitors stayed average of one week in Thailand with spend total of $1,000 to $1,300 each or $167 per day each.
Bangkok's multi-faceted sights, attractions and city life appeal to diverse groups of tourists. Royal palaces and temples as well as several museums constitute its major historical and cultural tourist attractions. Shopping and dining experiences offer a wide range of choices and prices. The city is also famous for its dynamic nightlife. Although Bangkok's sex tourism scene is well-known, this aspect is usually downplayed by the government.
Palaces and wats.
Bangkok, the centre of the Bangkok Metropolitan Area, has been the capital of Thailand since 1782, when the seat of government was moved across the Chao Phraya River from the Thonburi (west bank) side of the river. There are many palaces in the city, some still used by the Thai royal family, while others are now open to the public. A number also have become government buildings or university campuses, whilst several are museums.
The king's official residence is the Grand Palace, which has housed Thailand's monarchs for over 200 years. Before the 1932 Revolution ended the absolute monarchy, the complex was the home of Thai government: it included royal courts, administrative branches, similar to the earlier capital at Ayutthaya. It houses the Chakri Mahaprasat Hall and Wat Phra Kaew, which contains the Emerald Buddha and is considered the most important temple in Thailand. However, the more modern Chitralada Palace is the actual Bangkok residence of the reigning monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), and his Queen Sirikit.
Of the hundreds of Buddhist temples (or wats) located in Bangkok, only a few are of much interest to tourists. When King Taksin led his troops out of Ayutthaya and into Thonburi in 1767 CE, they took refuge in Wat Arun. The most prominent feature is a tall chedi built in the 1820s that stands. It was tallest structure in Bangkok until the modern skyscrapers were built a few decades ago.
Wat Pho'," also known as the Temple of the Reclining Buddha or Wat Phra Chetuphon, is south of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and the Grand Palace. It is Bangkok's largest temple and contains a huge reclining Buddha figure that is long and is covered with gold leaf. The feet alone are in size.
Wat Suthat is one of the oldest temples and the site of the Giant Swing, formerly used in an annual Brahman ceremony. A huge teak arch from which the swing was hung still stands in front of the temple.
Wat Saket, or the Golden Mount ("Phu Khao Thong" in Thai), houses relics of the Buddha in a 58-metre-high chedi surmounted by a golden cupola. Built by King Rama I just outside the new city's walls, the temple served as the main crematorium. In the century after its construction, some 60,000 plague victims were either cremated there or placed outside for the vultures to devour.
Museums.
The National Gallery Museum (พิพิธภัณฑสถานแห่งชาติ หอศิลป) is the former location of the Royal Thai Mint and exhibits collections of both traditional Thai and contemporary art famous by painters and sculptors of Thailand. A number of oil paintings made by His Majesty the King in his earlier years are exhibited here.
The National Museum (พิพิธภัณฑสถานแห่งชาติ พระนคร) is housed in former palace of the Wang Na or second king – Kromphraratchawangbowon Mahasurasinghanat – the designated heir to the throne in former years. Built simultaneously with the Grand Palace for Rama I's brother, the complex contains several major throne halls: the Phra Thinang Siwamok Phiman, the Phra Thinang Phutthaisawan, the and Phra Thinang Itsara Winitchai.
Suan Pakkad Palace (วังสวนผักกาด) is a complex of five Thai-style houses was once the residence of one of Thailand’s leading art collectors, Prince Chumbhot of Nagara Svarga. It contains an extensive collection of Asian art and antiques, including items from the prehistoric Ban Chiang civilisation, and an impressive collection of rare seashells. The Khon (classical Thai masked dance) Museum and the Traditional Thai Music Museum are also located here.
The Vimanmek Mansion Museum (พระที่นั่งวิมานเมฆ) is the world’s largest golden teak. It was built on Koh Chang island by King Rama V, but was moved to the compound of the Dusit Palace on Ratchawithi Road when 19th century French imperialists threatened the original location. The three-story royal mansion has 81 rooms, halls and ante-chambers, all containing royal memorabilia from the fifth reign. Royally-sponsored Thai art masterpieces are also on display near Vimanmek at the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall (พระที่นั่งอนันตสมาคม) as part of the 'Arts of the Kingdom' exhibition.
The Siriraj Medical Museum, located in the Siriraj Hospital on the west bank of the Chao Praya, is a large six-section medical museum with diverse exhibits on medicine in general, forensic medicine, and the history and present state of medical profession in Thailand. Often overlooked by tourists, the exhibits are a valuable resource for both medical professionals and interested laymen.
The Museum of Siam, located at Chanamchai road, focuses on the national identity of the people in Thailand which lets visitors learn about history of people in Thailand with a focus on people in Bangkok.
Public Parks.
Queen Sirikit Park(สวนสมเด็จพระนางเจ้าสิริกิติ์): It was built to commemorate the 60th birthday anniversary of HM Queen Sirikit. A big pool in the park contains three fountains and a fine collection of both Thai and foreign lotuses.
Lumphini Park (สวนลุมพินี): This was a huge open space once belonging to King Rama VI, who issued a royal command to turn the area into a public park as a gift to Bangkok residents.
Princess Mother Memorial Park (อุทยานเฉลิมพระเกียรติสมเด็จพระศรีนครินทราบรมราชชนนี): It was built near the Wat Anongkharam community where Somdej Phra Srinagarindra Boromarajajonani, HRH the Princess Mother had resided during her childhood. The park comprises a full scale model of the Princess Mother’s house and the old buildings renovated as exhibition halls displaying the life story of Her Royal Highness the Princess Mother as well as the history of the Wat Anongkharam community.
Shopping Areas/Markets.
Shopping in Bangkok is not limited to one or two major streets. There are many areas throughout Bangkok affording ample choices and easy access. The following is just a selection of some of the principal shopping areas.
Phloen Chit-Ratchaprasong (เพลินจิต-ราชประสงค์): Top department stores and luxury shopping malls are concentrated in the area, namely Gaysorn Plaza, Isetan, Erawan Bangkok, Peninsula Plaza, all of which together make the largest shopping promenade in Bangkok. Furthermore, Central World Plaza and Narayana Phand Pavilion, host the official handicraft centre selling items from all parts of the country. Ratchaprasong intersection is the gateway to several shopping areas such as Phloen Chit-Sukhumvit, Siam Square-Mahboonkrong, Silom and Pratunam-Phetchaburi.
Silom-Surawong-Patpong (สีลม-สุรวงศ์-พัฒพงษ์): Silom Road is the main artery of Bangkok’s commercial heart and is paralleled by Surawong Road, while Patpong runs crosswise between the two. In addition to housing dozens of specialist shops and boutiques representing all the major buys, this area also boasts many branches of well-known retailers and several shopping plazas. Street stalls also abound, most notably at Patpong’s famous night market.
Pratunam-Phetchaburi (ประตูน้ำ-เพชรบุรี): A highlight in the district is Pratunam market, one of Bangkok’s biggest centres for ready-to-wear clothing.
Cruise.
The Chao Phraya River & Bangkok’s Canals (Khlongs): Nineteenth-century Bangkok was laced with canals, giving the capital the designation ‘Venice of the East’. Surviving canals, and the Chao Phraya River provide memorable vignettes of traditional waterborne way-of-life that has remained essentially unchanged over the centuries. The river and canals may be conveniently explored by chartered boat or cruise.
Dinner Cruise: Riverine Bangkok offers some of the capital’s most arresting sights, particularly at night when the weather is cooler and light reflections bestow the Chao Phraya River with flickering lights.
Cultural Performances.
Jim Thompson Museum (พิพิธภัณฑ์จิม ทอมป์สัน) was constructed by American expatriate Jim Thompson from several traditional Thai-style houses, dismantled and assembled into one dwelling. Thompson helped restore and promote the Thai homemade silk industry after World War II. Following his mysterious disappearance in Malaysia in 1967, his home was turned into a museum to display his priceless collection of Asian art.
Theatres.
Chaloem Krung Royal Theatre (เฉลิมกรุงรอยัลเธียเตอร์) is located on Charoen Krung Road (New Road) near the Old Siam Plaza. Thai dramas and plays are held, while Khon or Thai musical dance drama are occasionally performed here.
The Traditional Thai Puppet Theatre (นาฏยศาลา หุ่นละครเล็ก) hosts the Hun Lakhon Lek puppet show. It was inspired by the intention of Master Sakhon Yangkhieosot (also known as Joe Louis), named a National Artist in 1996. Hun Lakhon Lek usually performs episodes of the Ramakian, the Thai version of the Ramayana epic. Sakhon Nattasin is currently the only performing troupe of Hun Lakhon Lek in Thailand, and in 2000 received a Thailand Tourism Award in Recreational Attraction from the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).
Patravadi Theatre (ภัทราวดีเธียเตอร์) Renowned for its lavish productions, this outdoor theatre has gained popularity through its modern adaptations of classical Asian literature, with each play demonstrating an ingenious blend of various theatrical techniques.
Siam Niramit (สยามนิรมิต) has state-of-the-art cultural performances which have achieved international standards. It uses special techniques integrated with drama to depict the history of each region of Thailand including depictions about hells, the forest of Himmaphan, heavens and lands beyond imagination from Thai literature. There is also a spectacular performance of Thailand’s arts and cultural heritage. The show is staged by more than 150 performers in a luxurious theatre with a capacity of more than 2,000 seats.
Hotels.
A number of deluxe hotels can be found in Bangkok, such as the Peninsula Bangkok, which recently made the top 10 in Travel and Leisure magazine's top 100 hotels list, coming in at #4, while the Oriental Hotel claimed the ninth spot. Sukhumvit Road hosts a series of international chains such as JW Marriott, The Landmark, InterContinental, Sheraton, and many boutique hotels such as Tenface Bangkok, The Davis, Unico Grande Sukhumvit. The Banyan Tree on Sathon, one of Bangkok's tallest hotels, featured the tallest bar and restaurant in the city, Vertigo, up until the launch of Sirocco Restaurant on top of State Tower, up from the bustling street set of Bang Rak.
Bangkok also offers a number of smaller boutique hotels for discerning travelers seeking uniquely designed lodgings and personalized service. There are large numbers of inexpensive hotels scattered throughout the city such as Yaowarat Road, most notably in the backpackers' paradise of Khao San Road. Unlike Western cities, motels are uncommon in Bangkok. However, a fast and growing business is bed and breakfasts adapted to suit the Asian lifestyle. A variety of these small houses can be found in Phloen Chit, Watthana and Khlong Toei.
Shopping.
Thailand has a variety of shopping experiences from street markets to world class luxury malls. Tourists have historically always preferred markets and bazaars to the other forms of shopping. The Chatuchak weekend market is one of the largest shopping destinations in Bangkok.

<doc id="19927457" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19927457" title="Baltimore bank riot">
Baltimore bank riot

The Baltimore bank riot of 1835 was a violent reaction to the failure of the Bank of Maryland in 1834. The riot, which lasted from 6-9 August, was aimed at the homes and property of a number of former directors of the bank, who had been accused of financial misconduct and fraud. The Baltimore bank riot was one of the most violent and destructive events in any American city prior to the Civil War. Rioters destroyed many of the homes of the city's wealthiest and most prominent citizens, and much valuable property was smashed or burned. The authorities were unable to control the violence and effectively surrendered the city to the mob, which was actively or passively supported by numerous bystanders.
Background.
The closure of the Bank of Maryland in the spring of 1834, combined with the failure of other financial institutions, resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in deposits held by the public. The bank's creditors awaited a financial settlement, but after 17 months without a result, many had lost patience and would soon turn to violence.
Riot.
On Thursday, August 6, 1835, a small crowd approached bank director and U.S. Senator Reverdy Johnson's (1796-1876) home (previously mansion/townhouse of James Buchanan, built 1799 opposite old Courthouse Square and site of first brick house built in Baltimore Town in 1741 for Edward Fortrell) on Battle Monument Square on the northwest corner of North Calvert and East Fayette Streets in Baltimore, broke his windows and left. Anticipating further violence, Mayor of Baltimore Jesse Hunt and other citizens began to guard Johnson's home. A hostile crowd returned on Friday evening, August 7th and broke more windows, despite the mayor's presence. Mayor Hunt addressed the mob and managed to persuade them to disperse.
Anticipating further violence, Mayor Jesse Hunt summoned thirty armed horsemen who formed a cordon across the entrance to Battle Monument Square. The next evening, a large crowd gathered in Baltimore Street and marched north on Calvert toward the mayor and his guard. Unable to break through, the crowd moved to the home of Judge John Glenn, another bank director, where they smashed windows, broke through a barricaded front door, threw furniture into the street, and tore down the entire front wall. Police arrived and fired into the mob, but the rioters refused to disperse.
On Sunday, August 9, the mob returned to the Johnson home, this time overpowering the guard there and causing further destruction, making a bonfire in the street out of Johnson's valuable law library. Having taken full control of the town, the mob continued its destruction against the homes of bank director John B. Morris, Mayor Hunt, Evan T. Ellicott, a Captain Bentzinger, and one "Captain Willy", whose guilt was merely that he had protested the mob's activities.
In an effort to resolve the situation, a mass meeting was held at the massive domed "Merchants' Exchange" building, (designed by famed architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe which housed various Federal offices, courts, post office and maritime businesses) on South Gay between Water and East Lombard Streets. Mayor Hunt, having lost the confidence of the citizens of Baltimore, resigned. In his place the 83-year old General Sam Smith (1752-1839), former senator and mayor, hero of the Revolution at Fort Mifflin and of Baltimore's defenses during the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812, took over the government of the city. 
Smith organized volunteers to march with him to Howard's Park (and Woods) at the estate of "Belvedere" of recently deceased Col. John Eager Howard (1752-1827), commander of the famed "Maryland Line" regiment of the Continental Army in the Revolution, north of the town where the Washington Monument had recently been completed. A great crowd responded and received instructions to arm themselves and assemble at old City Hall, then located on Holliday Street between East Saratoga and Lexington Streets in the former old Peale Museum. At 3,000 in number, Smith's army of volunteers humbled the mob. A call for help had already gone out to Annapolis and Washington for federal troops, though by the time they arrived, the Baltimore mob had dispersed and the city was quiet.
Aftermath.
The leaders of the mob were identified, brought to trial, fined, and imprisoned. Those whose property was destroyed filed suit against the State of Maryland for its failure to protect them. They won their cases and received a total of $100,000 in compensation.
Legacy.
The Baltimore bank riot riot foreshadowed the later Panic of 1837, a national financial crisis which damaged the reputation of the administration of President Andrew Jackson and his successor Martin van Buren.

The railway was originally planned as a section of a projected railway connection from the Mürztal to Mariazell, and was opened 1893. The line brought an economic upswing to the region because of the availability of goods traffic, and the iron industry particularly profited from the introduction of rail transport. Passenger traffic never achieved great importance, since the larger places were convenient off the distance such as Aflenz or Turnau and also the proposed connection to Mariazell was never realised.
Passenger traffic was stopped on March 15, 1959, and the section from Seebach-Turnau to Au-Seewiesen was closed and removed in 1964. However goods traffic from the iron industry in Thörl continued to develop positively. In the 1960s the railway changed over to diesel traction, modern wagons were procured, and the track upgraded to cope with the increased loads. Lastly at the beginning of the 1990s modern workshops were built at Kapfenberger.
The section from Aflenz to Seebach-Turnau, which only saw sporadic traffic in timber products, was closed at the end of 1990. The Thörlerbahn Association, which was established to protect this section from demolition, in 1991 proposed a tourist operation with borrowed vehicles. This offer was accepted, so in the following years a promising museum course project was developed: passenger vehicles were built based on historical designs on goods wagons chassis and the last original steam engine, No. 6 THÖRL, the last existing locomotive of class Z, was rented from Club 760 and re-activated.
A bank failure in 1995 led to the local iron industry going bankrupt, so after the loss of the largest (and practically only) freight customer, the National Railways felt compelled to close the railway. The Thörlerbahn Association was able to operate over the entire length of the railway until the end of the 1997 season, however for financial reasons were not able to take control of the entire 20 km length. There was a lack of support of the railway in the region, local preferences were to convert the railway into a bicycle track and to widen the federal highway. The Thörlerbahn Association announced bankruptcy after loss of the season 1998, and the vehicles were sold or returned to their owners. On 31 October 1999 a hand trolley was driven on the Thörlerbahn for the last time.
The railway was dismantled in 2003 and 2004.

Politics.
In her book "When I'm Sixty-Four: The Plot against Pensions and the Plan to Save Them", Ghilarducci proposed mandatory participation in a government-run savings plan to which each worker and his employer would supplement his Social Security pension by contributing 2.5 percent each of her or his salary. The plan would be administered by the Social Security Administration, but would be separate from Social Security records. In turn, a refundable tax credit of $600 would go to each participant, regardless of his contributions. The account would have a guaranteed interest rate equal to the government's official inflation rate plus three percent.
Videos of lectures given by her and interviews with her can be found on YouTube.
Criticism.
In response to her book, "When I'm Sixty-Four: The Plot against Pensions and the Plan to Save Them", James Pethokoukis of "U.S. News & World Report" in jest called her ""the Most Dangerous Woman in America"". Ghilarducci reported to Princeton University Press that she was surprised to discover that the label was being applied to her.

Back to Now

Back to Now is the seventh and latest studio album by American R&B female group Labelle, released on October 21, 2008. The album is the group's first in over thirty years though they had sung on songs together on occasion. 
In terms of the title, Labelle member Nona Hendrx explained to noted R&B writer Pete Lewis of 'Blues & Soul' "It basically stemmed from two of the songs on this album being songs I'd specifically written for what would have been the next Labelle album back in 1977. So the title 'Back To Now" is really signifiying that this record represents us really getting back to where we were. It's basically a continuation from where we stopped off."
The first single is "Roll Out", which features and is produced by Wyclef Jean which had the three Labelle members Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash singing in autotune. 
The album is also notable for the modest R&B charted ballad, "Superlover". Except for "The Truth Will Set You Free", originally recorded by Mother's Finest, in which Hendryx sings the lead over Lenny Kravitz's guitar and LaBelle's ad-libs in soprano and "System", which LaBelle, Hendryx and Dash each take a prominent lead vocal, the album is led as always by LaBelle, who gives a powerful vocal in the socially conscious "Tears for the World", a Hendryx composition.
The album is also notable for their tribute to civil rights activist Rosa Parks with "Dear Rosa" and also includes their 1971 rendition of the Cole Porter standard, "Miss Otis Regrets", which was originally recorded for sessions of their Warner debut, "Labelle", but was cut from the album's final selection of tracks.
An iTunes edition of the album features the group's cover of Sylvester's disco hit, "You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)".
Charts.
"Back to Now" debuted at number 45 on "Billboard"'s album chart in the issue dated November 8, 2008. It also charted on R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, debuting at number 9. "Back to Now" is Labelle's seventh overall, and third highest-ranked album to chart in the United States.

Inflation hedge

Inflation hedge is an investment with intrinsic value such as oil, natural gas, gold, farmland, and to a lesser degree commercial real estate. Typically most hard assets are an excellent inflation hedge. In general, commodities/hard assets are negatively correlated to both stocks and bonds. In other words, when stocks and bonds decline, commodities tend to appreciate. In addition, during periods of high inflation/negative real interest rates equities and bonds do poorly (see 20% total return over 11 years from 1970 to 1981 for the S&P 500 v. 1,100% increase in oil prices and 550% increase in western Canada farmland prices during same period) while commodities and other hard assets appreciate in value.

First Circuit nomination under Bush.
Smith was nominated on December 6, 2007 by President George W. Bush to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated by Judge Bruce Marshall Selya, who took senior status on December 31, 2006. Rhode Island's two Democratic senators, Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, both of whom had been cut out of Smith's selection by the White House, issued a lukewarm joint response to the nomination: "Before giving someone a lifetime appointment to the federal bench we need to carefully review their record. We will be sure to give Judge Smith’s nomination thorough and independent review." Previously, Whitehouse had suggested in September 2007 that the Senate should not consider any Bush appointment for the First Circuit that late in the president’s term. Smith's nomination was not confirmed.

Der lustige Krieg ("The Merry War") is the name of a three-act operetta composed by Johann Strauss II. The work was first performed on 25 November 1881 at the Theater an der Wien. Its libretto was by F Zell (Camillo Walzel) and Richard Genée. The operetta was well received at its premiere, and was performed 69 times during its first run.
Synopsis.
It concerns a dispute between two states. The 'war' between them is played out as a game of love between Colonel Umberto Spinola, the commander-in-chief of the Genoese army, and the widowed Countess Violetta. Despite the name of the operetta, there is no fighting or bloodshed in the 'war'.

Chameleon (Labelle album)

Chameleon is the sixth album by American singing trio Labelle. Though Patti LaBelle's autobiography "Don't Block The Blessings" revealed that LaBelle planned a follow-up to "Chameleon" entitled "Shaman", the album never materialized. The trio would not release another new recording until 2008's "Back to Now". The final album was moderately successful peaking at #94 at the Pop charts and #21 on the R&B charts. Only two singles made the charts which were "Get You Somebody New" which peaked at #50 on the Pop charts and their memorable song "Isn't It A Shame" which debuted at #18 on the R&B charts. "Isn't It A Shame" was later sampled by Nelly on his 2004 hit, "My Place", which featured Jaheim.

After the Ball (song)

After the Ball is a popular song written in 1891 by Charles K. Harris. The song is a classic waltz in 3/4 time. In the song, an older man tells his niece why he has never married. He saw his sweetheart kissing another man at a ball, and he refused to listen to her explanation. Many years later, after the woman had died, he discovered that the man was her brother. 
"After the Ball" became the most successful song of its era, which at that time was gauged by the sales of sheet music. In 1892 it sold over two million copies of sheet music. Its total sheet music sales exceed five million copies, making it the best seller in Tin Pan Alley's history.
History.
The song was first interpolated into the musical "A Trip to Chinatown", sung by J. Aldrich Libbey, and was later famously used in the musical "Show Boat" to exemplify the 1890s style of music. There it was performed by Norma Terris. In the 1936 film version of the musical, it was performed by Irene Dunne, and in the 1951 film version, by Kathryn Grayson. Only the first verse and chorus were sung in "Show Boat".
It was also sung by Alice Faye in the 1940 biographical musical film, "Lillian Russell". The song is also heard in the 1936 movie, "San Francisco".
Lyrics.
<poem>
A little maiden climbed an old man's knee,
Begged for a story – "Do, Uncle, please.
Why are you single; why live alone?
Have you no babies; have you no home?"
"I had a sweetheart years, years ago;
Where she is now pet, you will soon know.
List to the story, I'll tell it all,
I believed her faithless after the ball."
After the ball is over,
After the break of morn –
After the dancers' leaving;
After the stars are gone;
Many a heart is aching,
If you could read them all;
Many the hopes that have vanished
After the ball.
Bright lights were flashing in the grand ballroom,
Softly the music playing sweet tunes.
There came my sweetheart, my love, my own –
"I wish some water; leave me alone."
When I returned dear there stood a man,
Kissing my sweetheart as lovers can.
Down fell the glass pet, broken, that's all,
Just as my heart was after the ball.
Long years have passed child, I've never wed.
True to my lost love though she is dead.
She tried to tell me, tried to explain;
I would not listen, pleadings were vain.
One day a letter came from that man,
He was her brother – the letter ran.
That's why I'm lonely, no home at all;
I broke her heart pet, after the ball.
</poem>
Parody.
The popularity of the song made it a natural for contemporary parody. A common version was:
<poem>
After the ball was over, after the break of morn,
After the dancers' leaving, after the stars are gone;
Many a heart is aching, if you could read them all;
Many the hopes that have vanished, after the ball.
After the ball was over, Bonnie took out her glass eye,
Put her false teeth in the water, hung up her wig to dry;
Placed her false arm on the table, laid her false leg on the chair;
After the party was over, Bonnie was only half there!
</poem>
Trivia.
In the movie "Driving Miss Daisy", Miss Daisy (played by Jessica Tandy) sings the refrain of "After the Ball" at the beginning of the movie.
In the Canadian television series "Wind at My Back", Grace Bailey (played by Kathryn Greenwood) also sings the refrain of the song in the episode "The Foolish Heart" when preparing for a Valentine Follies play.

Valle dei Templi

The Valle dei Templi (English: Valley of the Temples, Sicilian: Vaddi di li Tempri) is an archaeological site in Agrigento (ancient Greek "Akragas"), Sicily, southern Italy. It is one of the most outstanding examples of Greater Greece art and architecture, and is one of the main attractions of Sicily as well as a national monument of Italy. The area was included in the UNESCO Heritage Site list in 1997. Much of the excavation and restoration of the temples was due to the efforts of archaeologist Domenico Antonio Lo Faso Pietrasanta (1783–1863), who was the Duke of Serradifalco from 1809 through 1812.
The term "valley" is a misnomer, the site being located on a ridge outside the town of Agrigento.
Overview.
The Valley includes remains of seven temples, all in Doric style. The ascription of the names, apart from that of the "Olympeion", are a mere tradition established in Renaissance times. The temples are:
The Valley is also home to the so-called Tomb of Theron, a large tuff monument of pyramidal shape; scholars suppose it was built to commemorate the Romans killed in the Second Punic War.
Temple of Juno Lacinia.
This temple was constructed on a mostly artificial spur. It dates to c. 450 BC, measuring 38.15 x 16.90 m: it is in Doric style, peripteros 6 columns wide by 13 long, preceded by a pronaos and opisthodomos. The basement has four steps.
Current remains (including anastylosis from the 18th Century onwards) consist of the front colonnade with parts of the architrave and of the frieze. Only fragments of the other three sides survive, with few elements of the cella. The building was damaged in the fire of 406 BC and restored in Roman times, with the substitution of clay marble roof tiles with ones and the addition of a steep rise in the area where today can be seen the remains of the altar.
Nearby are arcosolia and other sepultures from Byzantine times, belonging to the late 6th century AD renovation of the Temple of Concordia into a Christian church.
Temple of Concordia.
Due to its good state of preservation, the Temple of Concordia is ranked amongst the most notable edifices of the Greek civilization existing today. It has a peristatis of 6 x 13 columns built over a basement of 39.44 x 16.91 m; each Doric column has twenty grooves and a slight entasis, and is surmounted by an architrave with triglyphs and metopes; also perfectly preserved are the tympani. The cella, preceded by a pronaos, is accessed by a single step; also existing are the pylons with the stairs which allowed to reach the roof and, over the cella's walls and in the blocks of the peristasis entablature, the holes for the wooden beam of the ceiling. The exterior and the interior of the temple were covered by polychrome stucco. The upper frame had gutters with lion-like protomes, while the roof was covered by marble tiles.
When the temple was turned into a church the entrance was moved to the rear, and the rear wall of the cella was destroyed. The spaces between the columns were closed, while 12 arched openings were created in the cella, in order to obtain a structure with one nave and two aisles. The pagan altar was destroyed and sacristies were carved out in the eastern corners. The sepultures visible inside and outside the temple date to the High Middle Age.
Temple of Asclepius.
The temple of Asclepius is located in the middle of the San Gregorio plain. Its identification is based on a mention by Polybius (I, 18, 2), who states that the temple was "in front of the city", one mile away. However, as the actual distance does not correspond and the size of the building is relatively small, scholars remains dubious about this attribution. 
The small temple, probably dating to the late 5th century BC and measuring 21.7 x 10.7 m, rises over a basement with three steps. Its peculiarity is the fake opysthodomus with two semi-columns in the external side of the rear cella. Also extant are parts of the entablature, with lion-like protomes, a frieze and a "geison" pediment.
The sanctuary housed a bronze statue of Apollo by Myron, a gift to the city by Scipio, which was stolen by Verres.
Temple of Heracles.
The traditional name of this temple comes from another mention by Cicero about a temple dedicated to the classical hero "not far from the forum"; however, it has never been proven the latter (the "agora" of the Greek city) was located in this point.
Stylistically, the temple belongs to the last years of the 6th century BC. It has been also suggested that this temple was one of first built under Theron. Also the entablature, of which parts have been found, would date it to the 470-460s or the middle 5th century BC (though the more recent remains could be a replacement of the older ones). One hypothesis is that the temple was begun before the Battle of Himera, to be completed only in the following decades. Polyaenus mentions a temple of Athena being built under Theron outside the city, which could be identified with that of "Hercules", though also with a new one in the inner acropolis.
The building, with 20th-century anastylosis, measures 67 x 25.34 m, with a peristais of 6 x 15  Doric columns and a cella with pronaos and opysthodomus, is located over a three-step basement. It is the first example (later become common in the Agrigento temples) of pylons inserted between the pronaos and cella, housing the stair which allowed inspections of the roof. The columns are rather high and have wide capitals. On the eastern side are remains of the large altar.
"Olympeion" field.
On the other side of the road running through the Golden Gate of the ancient city, is a plain commanded by the huge "Olympeion" field. This includes a "platea" with a large temple to Olympian Zeus, plus other areas still under investigation. These include a sanctuary, with remains of a paved square, a complex "sacellum" ("holy enclosure") and a "tholos". This, after another gate, is followed by a sanctuary of chthonic deities, an archaic sanctuary, the so-called "colimbetra" (where was a still unknown gate) and the tip of the spur where the sanctuary is located, with the temple of Vulcan.
The Olympeion complex's main attraction is the huge temple of Olympian Zeus, which was described with enthusiastic words by Diodorus Siculus and mentioned by Polybius. Today it is reduced to ruins due to destruction begun in antiquity and continued through the 18th century, when the temple was used as a quarry for the port of Porto Empedocle. 
Near the south-western corner of the temples is a small edifice (12,45 x 5,90 m) with two naves and a deep "pronaos", a double entrance and what has been identified as an altar. Its dating is controversial, though scholars have assigned it to the archaic era, due to the discovery of numerous 6th century BC vases. Also archaic is another "sacellum", which later was replaced by a classical edifice. These are followed by the scant remains of a temple (called "Tempio L") dating to the mid-5th century BC, measuring 41.8 x 20.20 meters, to which, in the 3rd century BC, a Hellenistic entablature was added.
Temple of the Dioscuri.
North to the Tempio L are the corner of "Temple of Castor and Pollux", which is in a fact a modern reconstruction from the early 19th century, created using pieces from various other temples. It includes four columns and an entablature mounted over the foundings of an originary temple 31 x 13.39 m, and which would have been a Doric perypteros with 6 x 13 columns, and which dated to about the mid-5th century BC.
Temple of Vulcan.
On the other side of the valley is the last spur of the hill, commanded by the remains of the Temple of Vulcan. It is a Doric-style building from the 5th century BC, with an archaic "sacellumm" enclosed into a Classic-era cella. The "sacellum" measures 13.25 x 6.50 meters; its decoration, dating to c. 560-550 BC, has been recently reconstructed. The classic temple, a Doric perypteros, measured 43 x 20.85 meters, rising mounted on a four-step "krepidoma" and having 6 x 13 columns; it dates to around 430 BC.
Other remains.
On the western side of the city are the remains of Gates VI and VII, the first probably lying on the road to Heracles, the second having two towers and two external bastions (one having 15-metre thick walls); northwards are the remains of Gates VIII and IX, now surrounded by illegal buildings. 
At the western tip of the area in which the Temple of Concordia lies, are parts of a late-ancient or early-medieval necropolis, constructed on existing cisterns. Other tombs and catacombs are visible in the so-called "Grotte Fragapane", dating to the 4th century AD. 
These late-Roman and Byzantine necropolises lie in an area used for tombs since ancient times. One of these, the so-called Tomb of Theron, is a "naiskos" sepulchre with square plan. Gate IV is located near the tomb of Theron: probably one of the most important in the city, as it led to the sea.
West of the "Olympeion", are remains of two insulae (residences) 38 m wide, connected by a square to the ancient Gate V. It is likely that they were built re-using structures belonging to the sacred area of the "Olympeion". Nearby is a sanctuary with an L-shaped portico from the early 5th century BC, which is annexed to Gate V. In the area are also two archaic (mid-6th century BC) temples.
On the northern side of Gate V is a large stone square leading to the "Sanctuary of the Chthonic Gods".
The so-called "Oratory of Phalaris" is in fact a Roman temple, measuring 12.40 x 8.85 m.

Portuguese East India Company

The Portuguese East India Company () was a short-lived ill-fated attempt by the Philip II, King of the Iberian Union to create a national chartered company to look after interests in Portuguese India in the face on encroachment by the Dutch and English following the union of the Portuguese and Spanish Kingdoms.
Background.
Portuguese trade with India had been a crown monopoly since the Portuguese captain Vasco da Gama opened the sea route to India in 1497-99. The monopoly had been managed by the Casa da Índia, the royal trading house founded around 1500. The Casa was responsible for the yearly India armadas. However, by 1560, the Casa's finances were in dire straits and in 1570, King Sebastian of Portugal issued a decree opening up trade to India to any private Portuguese national. As few took up the offer, the free trade decree was replaced in 1578 by a new system of annual monopolies, where the Casa sold India trading contracts to a private Portuguese merchant consortium, granting them a monopoly for one year. This annual contract system was abandoned in 1597, and the royal monopoly resumed.
The Iberian Union of 1580, which gave King Philip II of Spain the crown of Portugal, changed little at first. But the vigorous Dutch VOC and English EIC encroachments on the Portuguese empire and trade in Asia after 1598 forced the king to experiment with different arrangements to defend the Portuguese positions. In 1605, he created the "Conselho da Índia", to bring affairs in Portuguese India under closer supervision of the Hapsburg crown. But this conflicted with older lines of Portuguese authority, and the council was eventually dissolved in 1614.
Proposal.
It was around this time (1614) that the idea for a chartered private Portuguese East Indies company, organized along the lines of Dutch and English companies, was first broached. This was promoted by Portuguese New Christian merchant and Mercantilist pamphleteer Duarte Gomes Solis who lived in Madrid, most notably in his Spanish language tract "Discursos sobre los Comercios de las Indias" (published 1622, although circulated earlier). Solis argued that a private joint stock company could raise more capital, revive the Asian trade and compete more efficiently with the Anglo-Dutch in the Indian Ocean.
King Philip III of Portugal (IV of Spain) put the idea in motion in 1624 and appointed D. Jorge Mascarenhas, mayor of Lisbon and member of the Council of State, to head a committee to implement Solis proposal. Despite being supported by Olivares, the proposal faced much skepticism and opposition, particularly by the Duke of Villahermosa (head of the Council of Portugal), and Mascarenhas had considerable trouble securing investment commitments.
The Company.
The "Companhia do commércio da Índia" (or "Companhia da Índia Oriental") finally came into existence in August 1628, when it was granted a charter by King Philip III (IV of Spain). The Companhia was to be governed by a "Câmara de Administração Geral", composed of a president (Jorge Mascarenhas) and six administrators, elected by the investors, with full powers, although is judicial acts, administrative practices and finances were subject to review by an advisory "Conselho do Comércio" (Board of Trade) in the king's court in Madrid. The charter envisaged a two-year transition period, during which the royal "Conselho da Fazenda" would continue to supervise the India fleets, the Casa da Índia and the Armazém da Índia, before passing them all over to the Companhia's administration. The Companhia would be in charge of running & collecting the customs dues payable at the Casa. 
The Companhia was established with a joint-stock block of six years, renewable for another six with a minimum subscription of 100 "cruzados". The Companhia was granted a monopoly on trade in coral, pepper, cinnamon, ebony and cowrie shells, and could be extended to other items upon request. It had full administrative & juridical privileges, including the right to keep all spoils from seizures of Dutch and English ships (after deducting the royal fifth). 
The crown was the largest investor, committing 1,500,000 cruzados for the first three years. Although some municipalities (esp. Lisbon) also invested, private individuals were less interested. To make it attractive, subscribers were guaranteed an annual return of 4% plus dividends and the subscriptions were laced with various privileges (e.g. title in king's household, protection from debt seizure, even the capital of New Christians convicted by the Holy Inquisition, had a measure of protection). Although there were provisions against allowing any other East Indies company to be formed in Hapsburg territories, investment in the Companhia was open to all subjects of Philip III (IV of Spain) and his allies (thus Spaniards, Italians, Flemings, etc.) Nonetheless, none of this was enough to garner much enthusiasm from private individuals. The company was launched with only around half the capital it originally sought to raise.
The end.
The Companhia proved unsuccessful. Investors remained skeptical, overseas Portuguese merchants rejected the new Companhia's authority, and the Anglo-Dutch breach of the old Portuguese empire in Asia had become irreparable, squeezing margins on the spice trade. The Companhia proved unprofitable, and soon ceased operating and was liquidated in April, 1633. The Casa da Índia and the India trade was brought back under the supervision of the "Conselho da Fazenda" (royal finance council).

Salah Aboud Mahmoud

Salah Aboud Mahmoud (born 1950; Arabic: صلاح عبود محمود) is a former Iraqi Army general, best known for his role in Battle of Khafji and 73 Easting, during the Persian Gulf War.
Career.
On January 29, 1991, Salah took part in battle with coalition forces to take control of the Saudi Arabian city of Khafji. Mahmoud also took part in the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988, along with the tank battle of 73 Easting.
Salah was appointed commander of the Iraqi Third Corps in the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war, a regular process in the Iraqi military to ensure that former high-ranking officers did not pose a threat to the Ba'athist Iraqi government. He was later governor of Dhi Qar Province, a Shia province which had briefly been taken by the 1991 Iraqi insurgency before it was brutally suppressed.
1990s.
In December 1994, Major-General Wafiq Al-Samarrai defected to Jordan and called on officers to revolt against Saddam Hussein's regime. Salah was one of them he called on. He did not, and despite his connections to many of the purged officers he was never executed. Rather, he was gradually forced out of his government roles. President Hussein divided Iraq into four administrative regions in 1998. Many expected Salah would be recalled to the military and appointed to the Central Euphrates governorship as governor Mizban had been dismissed. However this did not come to pass and Mizban was reinstated.
Invasion of Iraq.
After the Invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Salah disappeared and his current whereabouts are unknown.

Rodney D. Bagley, PhD, is an engineer and co-inventor of the catalytic converter.
Rodney Bagley was born in Ogden, Utah, on 2 October 1934. He earned a B.S. in geological engineering in 1960, and a PhD in ceramic engineering in 1964, both from the University of Utah. He worked for Corning Incorporated from 1963 until his retirement in 1994, researching unique ceramic materials. Bagley is a Corning Research fellow, an American Ceramic Society fellow, and recipient of the Geijsbeck Award (1985) and the International Ceramics Prize (1996). He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2002.
The Clean Air Act (1970) set new standards for automotive emissions. Bagley, as part of a Corning team that also included Irwin Lachman and geologist Ronald Lewis, invented the core, or substrate, used in modern catalytic converters. They developed the extrusion die along with a process that made a thin-walled, honeycomb cellular ceramic substrate. Thousands of cellular channels through the structure allowed for a large surface area. The inside surface area was then coated with a catalyst that reacted with pollutants, converting 95% of exhaust pollutants into harmless emissions, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor. A restriction of the ceramic substrate was that due to its sensitivity, only lead-free gasoline could be used. Ceramic substrate technology is now used by every automotive manufacturer in the world and is credited with reducing automotive pollutants by more than three billion tons worldwide.

Cemesto

Cemesto is a sturdy, light-weight, waterproof and fire-resistant composite building material made from a core of sugar cane fiber insulating board surfaced on both sides with asbestos and cement. Its name is a portmanteau word combining "cem" from "cement" and "esto" from "asbestos." 
Cemesto was introduced by the Celotex Company in 1937. It was manufactured in the form of boards and panels that were wide, about thick, and to long. Each by panel weighs just . Cemesto was used primarily for interior and exterior walls.
The John B. Pierce Foundation and Celotex collaborated to develop a prefabrication system for building low-cost housing using cemesto panels, in which single cemesto panels were slid horizontally into light wooden frames to create walls. A prototype cemesto house was displayed at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City. The Pierce system was first used in 1941 for building employee housing at the Glenn L. Martin Aircraft Company near Baltimore, Maryland. For this development, named Aero Acres, the architecture firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed gable-roofed Cape Cod houses with dimensions of by , featuring large commercial-style windows in their principal rooms. In 1941 a total of 600 homes were built at Aero Acres using this design.
During World War II, when other building materials were in short supply, cemesto was used extensively in the United States. Cemesto was used to build temporary office buildings in Washington, D.C. Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill adapted the Pierce system and used cemesto panels for the designs of some 2,500 pre-fabricated homes, known by the nickname "cemestos," erected in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to house Manhattan Project workers and their families. In 1942 the U.S. Farm Security Administration built 400 cemesto homes in Maryland at a site alongside Aero Acres.
During the 1940s, the manufacturer of cemesto touted it as a material that would in the future make it possible to mass-produce housing at a low cost. One use of the material during the post-war era was in the late 1940s in Circle Pines, Minnesota, where cemesto panels were used in building the first homes in what was envisioned to be a cooperative housing community for people of color. The use of cemesto in Circle Pines came to be regarded as substandard construction, as the builders failed to adequately seal the joints between cemesto panels.
Several prominent architects embraced cemesto as a modern material and used it in their designs. For the Bousquet-Wightman House in Houston, Texas, built in 1941, architect Donald Barthelme used cemesto panels for exterior sheathing. In 1949 Edward Durell Stone called for cemesto panels in the design of a home to be built in Armonk, New York. That same year, Charles Eames designed his Eames House, Case Study House #8, to use brightly painted and unfinished Cemesto panels in a prefabricated steel frame. Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Raymond Carlson House in Phoenix, Arizona, built in 1950, to use a structural system of wood posts and cemesto boards. In the Arthur Pieper House in Paradise Valley, Arizona, built in 1952 from concrete block, Wright used cemesto for the ceilings.
In addition to houses and office buildings, cemesto was used to build gasoline stations and factories.

Colin Lindsay, 3rd Earl of Balcarres

Colin Lindsay, 3rd Earl of Balcarres (1652–1722) was a Scottish aristocrat and politician, one of the most important supporters of James II of England.
Biography.
Early life.
Colin Lindsay was baptized at Kilconquhar on 23 August 1652, the second surviving son of Alexander Lindsay, first Earl of Balcarres by his wife, Lady Anna Mackenzie, daughter and coheiress of Colin Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Seaforth. 
He succeeded to the earldom, while still a child, on the death at the age of twelve, of his brother Charles, second earl, 15 Oct. 1662. In 1670 at the age of sixteen, he was presented at court by his cousin the Duke of Lauderdale, when Charles II, partly because he conceived a liking for him personally, and partly in recognition of his father's services, gave him command of a select cavalry troop manned by gentlemen in reduced circumstances. Not long afterwards he was married to Mademoiselle Mauritiade Nassau, sister of Lady Arlington and the Countess of Nassau, and daughter of Louis de Nassau, count of Beverwaert and Auverquerque in Holland; but at the ceremony he, by mistake, placed a mourning instead of a wedding ring on the finger of the bride, who took the evil omen so much to heart that she died within a year. After her death he went to sea with the Duke of York (the future James II of England), under whom he distinguished himself at the battle of Solebay, 28 May 1672.
Second marriage and public offices.
In 1673 he married Lady Jean Carnegie, eldest daughter of David Carnegie, 2nd Earl of Northesk, and thereby incurring the king's displeasure, was forbidden to appear at court. Retiring to the country he occupied his leisure in study. On the death of his wife, six years afterwards, he was permitted to return to court, and on 3 June 1680 was made a privy-councillor and in 1682 sheriff of Fife. 
Along with Claverhouse he took active measures against the covenanters in Fife, and in January 1686 obtained a commission to hold with him a justiciary court for their trial.
Reign of James II and after.
After the accession of James II Balcarres was, on 3 September 1686, appointed a commissioner of the treasury, and in 1688 was made lord-lieutenant of Fife. So much was he trusted by the king, that when the scheme for the descent of the Prince of Orange became known, the chancellor, Lord Perth, was ordered to rely on his advice and that of the Earl of Cromarty in the measures to be adopted for the defence of Scotland. Lord Melfort, secretary of state, however, who was jealous of Balcarres's influence, rejected his suggested plan of defence as too expensive, and it was determined instead to send the forces then available in Scotland southwards. Balcarres, meanwhile, was sent by the Scottish privy council to England to receive further instructions, and succeeded in reaching London. 
After the king's return from Faversham, Balcarres, along with Dundee, waited on him on the morning of 17 Nov. in his bedroom at Whitehall. At the request of the king they accompanied him on a walk in the Mall, when, having expressed his final determination to leave the country, he stated that on his arrival in France he would send Balcarres a commission to manage his civil affairs, and Dundee one to command the troops in Scotland. 
After the flight of the king Balcarres waited on the Prince of Orange, to whom he was previously known through his first wife, the prince's cousin. While expressing his respect for the prince, Balcarres declined to act against the king, whereupon the prince warned him of the danger he ran if he transgressed the law. Along with Dundee, Balcarres was permitted to return to Scotland, and they arrived in Edinburgh about the end of February 1689. 
The Duke of Gordon was already negotiating the surrender of the castle, when Balcarres and Dundee waited on him, and persuaded him to hold out till he saw what the Convention of Estates intended to do. On the capture of a messenger from Ireland with letters to Balcarres from the king, Balcarres was seized and confined in his own lodging. His request for permission to live in England was refused, and on account of further compromising letters sent to him by Melfort, he was confined for four months in the common gaol of Edinburgh. Soon after his release he became connected with the Montgomery plot for James's restoration, and on its discovery in 1690 he left the country.
In exile.
He landed at Hamburg, and while journeying to Holland, through Flanders, was seized by a party of banditti, who, however, agreed to free him on payment of a hundred pistoles, which he succeeded in obtaining from the jesuits at the Catholic college of Douay. He proceeded to St. Germains, where he was well received by James, to whom he presented his "Memoirs touching the Revolution". On account of the misrepresentations of Melfort and others, he, however, found it necessary, after six months at St. Germains, to leave the court, and went to the south of France. Thence he sent an expostulatory letter to James. Ultimately the exiled king invited him to return; but he deemed acceptance of the invitation injudicious while the old favourites were in power, and after a year's sojourn in France finally settled with his family at Utrecht. Here he made the acquaintance of Pierre Bayle, Leclerc, and other learned men.
Return to Scotland.
Ultimately, through the interposition of William Carstares and the Duke of Queensberry, who wrote of him pityingly, as an 'instance of the folly of Jacobitism', he was permitted towards the close of 1700 to return to Scotland. 
He was now in greatly impoverished circumstances, and although the Duke of Marlborough, an old friend and companion, obtained for him a rent-charge of £500 a year for ten years upon the crown lands of Orkney, he was compelled by his necessities, before the ten years expired, to sell his rights there. 
In his extremity he wrote to Queen Anne, asking for the restoration of his pension of £1000 a year, of which he had been deprived at the revolution, and in all probability some allowance was made him. 
He was appointed a privy councillor in April 1706, and supported the union with England in 1707. But in 1715 he was unable to resist the invitation to join the Jacobite prince's standard, and he was one of the most zealous of his supporters. On the collapse of the rebellion, it was arranged, owing to the friendly interposition of Argyll and Marlborough, that on his surrendering he should be sent to his own house at Balcarres. He remained a prisoner there under the charge of one dragoon till the indemnity. 
He spent in retirement there the remainder of his life. finding a solace for his misfortunes in his love of art and letters. He had latterly so recovered his pecuniary position as to be able to purchase several good pictures by the Dutch masters and others, to add considerably to his library, and also to found the village which he named after himself Colinsburgh. He died at Balcarres in 1722, and was buried there in the private chapel of the family.
Character.
John Macky describes him in 1700 as 'a gentleman of very good natural parts,' with 'abundance of application, handsome in his person, very fair, and towards fifty years old.' Circumstances were adverse to the useful employment of his undoubted abilities, but had the folly and infatuation of James II been less, he might have been successful with Dundee in retrieving the Jacobite cause. His 'Memoirs touching the Revolution in Scotland,' published originally in 1714, reprinted 1754, and again, more correctly by the Bannatyne Club, in 1841, are invaluable as a narrative of the proceedings and negotiations of the supporters of the king in 1688-90.
Issue and succession.
By his second wife, Lady Jean Carnegie, Balcarres had a daughter Anne, married to Alexander, Earl of Kellie, and afterwards to James Seton, 3rd Viscount of Kingston.
By his third wife, Lady Jean Ker, only daughter of The Earl of Roxburghe, he had a son Colin, Lord Cumberland, master of Balcarres, who died unmarried in 1708, and a daughter Margaret, who married John, Earl of Wigton.
By his fourth wife, Lady Margaret, eldest daughter of James Campbell, 2nd Earl of Loudoun, he had seven children, of whom four survived him - two sons, Alexander, and James, and two daughters, Eleanor, married to the Hon. James Fraser of Lonmay, Aberdeenshire, third son of William Fraser, 12th Lord Saltoun, and Elizabeth, who died unmarried.

Wyoming Army National Guard Cavalry Stable

The Wyoming Army National Guard Cavalry Stable in Newcastle, Wyoming was built between 1933 and 1936 for the Wyoming National Guard's horses. It is the last National Guard cavalry stable in Wyoming. It has been used as the Anna Miller Museum by the Weston County Historical Society since 1966.
Anna Miller Museum.
The Anna Miller Museums is a museum of local history, with exhibits about the area's pioneers, Native Americans and prehistoric history. 
Stable history.
Funding for the stables was provided by the Depression-era Civil Works Administration and Works Progress Administration. The Newcastle National Guard unit was formed in 1899 as Company A, Second Regiment, Wyoming National Guard, becoming Company A of the Third Wyoming Infantry Regiment in 1905. In 1921 the Third Infantry Regiment was reorganized as the First Cavalry, finally becoming in 1942 Troop F, 115th Horse Mechanized Cavalry. Similar units with similar facilities existed in Sheridan, Douglas, Casper and Torrington.
The original plans for the stables included a by riding hall adjacent to the stables, using the same materials. Footings were started, but due to the onset of World War II the hall was never completed. Stone intended for the hall was appropriated for other local construction projects. Of the Wyoming units, only Torrington had a completed riding hall.
The one story building measures wide by long, with a rock-faced sandstone exterior. The walls are solid stone thick, with the stone obtained from a quarry on Salt Creek. Stonework was by the Sundstrom Brothers, who also worked on the Weston County Courthouse.
The building was built with stables and a caretaker's residence within. Much of the interior has an open ceiling with the roof structure visible above. The roof structure is heavy timber trusses on centers.
The Wyoming Army National Guard Cavalry Stable was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

Pressure Cookin'

Pressure Cookin' is the third album by American singing trio Labelle, released in August 1973. This release was their first and only for RCA Records, and was critically raved due to the songs that songwriter and member Nona Hendryx composed. The album is also notable for being the first album released following lead singer Patti LaBelle giving birth to her only child, son Zuri Edwards (she recorded the album while still pregnant with Zuri). 
Among notable songs were "Something in the Air"/"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised", in which all three bandmates: Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash each shared a rap, the biographical "(Can I Speak to You Before You Go to) Hollywood", which was inspired by the events following former member Cindy Birdsong ditching the group during its Blue Belles tenure to join The Supremes and which featured all three members having notable lead vocal parts, mainly from Dash, while Hendryx sung in the beginning and Patti LaBelle sang the following verses, the soulful ballad "Last Dance" and the bossa nova-inspired "Let Me See You in the Light".
Despite RCA releasing the Stevie Wonder composition, "Open Your Heart", the album failed to become a success. In spite of its initial failure, the album has gone on to become a cult classic and is considered a revolutionary album because few female groups talked so openly about social issues and other topics.

Effect of climate change on plant biodiversity

Environmental conditions play a key role in defining the function and distribution of plants, in combination with other factors. Changes in long term environmental conditions that can be collectively coined climate change are known to have had enormous impacts on plant diversity patterns in the past and are seen as having significant current impacts. It is predicted that climate change will remain one of the major drivers of biodiversity patterns in the future.
Palaeo context.
The Earth has experienced a constantly changing climate in the time since plants first evolved. In comparison to the present day, this history has seen Earth as cooler, warmer, drier and wetter, and CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations have been both higher and lower. These changes have been reflected by constantly shifting vegetation, for example forest communities dominating most areas in interglacial periods, and herbaceous communities dominating during glacial periods. It has been shown that past climatic change has been a major driver of the processes of speciation and extinction. The best known example of this is the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse which occurred 350 million years ago. This event decimated amphibian populations and spurred on the evolution of reptiles.
Modern Context.
There is significant current interest and research focus on the phenomenon of recent anthropogenic climate changes, or global warming. Focus is on identifying the current impacts of climate change on biodiversity, and predicting these effects into the future.
Changing climatic variables relevant to the function and distribution of plants include increasing CO2 concentrations, increasing global temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and changes in the pattern of ‘extreme’ weather events such as cyclones, fires or storms.
Because individual plants and therefore species can only function physiologically, and successfully complete their life cycles under specific environmental conditions (ideally within a subset of these), changes to climate are likely to have significant impacts on plants from the level of the individual right through to the level of the ecosystem or biome.
Effects of CO2.
Increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration for affect how plants photosynthesise, resulting in increases in plant water use efficiency, enhanced photosynthetic capacity and increased growth. Increased CO2 has been implicated in ‘vegetation thickening’ which affects plant community structure and function. Depending on environment, there are differential responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 between major ‘functional types’ of plant, such as C3 plant and C4 carbon fixation plants, or more or less woody species; which has the potential among other things to alter competition between these groups. Increased CO2 can also lead to increased Carbon : Nitrogen ratios in the leaves of plants or in other aspects of leaf chemistry, possibly changing herbivore nutrition.
Effects of temperature.
Increases in temperature raise the rate of many physiological processes such as photosynthesis in plants, to an upper limit. Extreme temperatures can be harmful when beyond the physiological limits of a plant.
Effects of water.
As water supply is critical for plant growth, it plays a key role in determining the distribution of plants. Changes in precipitation are predicted to be less consistent than for temperature and more variable between regions, with predictions for some areas to become much wetter, and some much drier.
General effects.
Environmental variables will not act in isolation, but also in combination with one other, and with other pressures such as habitat degradation and loss or the introduction of exotic species. It is suggested that that these other drivers of biodiversity change will act in synergy with climate change to increase the pressure on species to survive.
Direct impacts of climate change.
Changes in distributions.
If climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation change in a region beyond the tolerance of a species phenotypic plasticity, then distribution changes of the species may be inevitable. There is already evidence that plant species are shifting their ranges in altitude and latitude as a response to changing regional climates. Yet it is difficult to predict how species ranges will change in response to climate and separate these changes from all the other man-made environmental changes such as eutrophication, acid rain and habitat destruction.
When compared to the reported past migration rates of plant species, the rapid pace of current change has the potential to not only alter species distributions, but also render many species as unable to follow the climate to which they are adapted. The environmental conditions required by some species, such as those in alpine regions may disappear altogether. The result of these changes is likely to be a rapid increase in extinction risk. Adaptation to new conditions may also be of great importance in the response of plants.
Predicting the extinction risk of plant species is not easy however. Estimations from particular periods of rapid climatic change in the past have shown relatively little species extinction in some regions, for example. Knowledge of how species may adapt or persist in the face of rapid change is still relatively limited.
Changes in the suitability of a habitat for a species drive distributional changes by not only changing the area that a species can physiologically tolerate, but how effectively it can compete with other plants within this area. Changes in community composition are therefore also an expected product of climate change.
Changes in life-cycles (phenology).
The timing of phenological events such as flowering are often related to environmental variables such as temperature. Changing environments are therefore expected to lead to changes in life cycle events, and these have been recorded for many species of plants. These changes have the potential to lead to the asynchrony between species, or to change competition between plants. Flowering times in British plants for example have changed, leading to annual plants flowering earlier than perennials, and insect pollinated plants flowering earlier than wind pollinated plants; with potential ecological consequences. A recently published study has used data recorded by the writer and naturalist Henry David Thoreau to confirm effects of climate change on the phenology of some species in the area of Concord, Massachusetts.
Indirect impacts of climate change.
All species are likely to be not only directly impacted by the changes in environmental conditions discussed above, but also indirectly through their interactions with other species. While direct impacts may be easier to predict and conceptualise, it is likely that indirect impacts are be equally important in determining the response of plants to climate change.
A species whose distribution changes as a direct result of climate change may ‘invade’ the range of another species for example, introducing a new competitive relationship.
The range of a symbiotic fungi associated with plant roots may directly change as a result of altered climate, resulting in a change in the plants distribution.
A new grass may spread into a region, altering the fire regime and greatly changing the species composition.
A pathogen or parasite may change its interactions with a plant, such as a pathogenic fungus becoming more common in an area where rainfall increases.
Increased temperatures may allow herbivores to expand further into alpine regions, significant impacting the composition of alpine herbfields.
There are innumerable examples of how climate change could indirectly affect plant species, most of which will be extremely difficult to predict.
Higher level changes.
Species respond in very different ways to climate change. Variation in the distribution, phenology and abundance of species will lead to inevitable changes in the relative abundance of species and their interactions. These changes will flow on to affect the structure and function of ecosystems.
Challenges of modelling future impacts.
Accurate predictions of the future impacts of climate change on plant diversity are critical to the development of conservation strategies. These predictions have come largely from bioinformatic strategies, involving modelling individual species, groups of species such as ‘functional types’, communities, ecosystems or biomes. They can also involve modelling species observed environmental niches, or observed physiological processes.
Although useful, modelling has many limitations. Firstly, there is uncertainty about the future levels of greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change and considerable uncertainty in modelling how this will affect other aspects of climate such as local rainfall or temperatures. For most species the importance of specific climatic variables in defining distribution (e.g. minimum rainfall or maximum temperature) is unknown. It is also difficult to know which aspects of a particular climatic variable are most biologically relevant, such as average vs. maximum or minimum temperatures. Ecological processes such as interactions between species and dispersal rates and distances are also inherently complex, further complicating predictions.
Improvement of models is an active area of research, with new models attempting to take factors such as life-history traits of species or processes such as migration into account when predicting distribution changes; though possible trade-offs between regional accuracy and generality are recognised.
Climate change is also predicted to interact with other drivers of biodiversity change such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, or the introduction of foreign species. These threats may possibly act in synergy to increase extinction risk from that seen in periods of rapid climate change in the past.

Parting of the Ways (Wyoming)

The Parting of the Ways is an historic site in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, USA, where the Oregon and California Trails fork from the original route to Fort Bridger to an alternative route, the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff, across the Little Colorado Desert. Many wagon trains parted company, some preferring the shorter cutoff route, which involved fifty waterless miles, to the longer but better-watered main route.
The junction is marked by a small sandstone boulder about high, placed by L.C. Bishop and Paul Henderson and inscribed with a left-pointing arrow with "F. Bridger" and aright-pointing arrow with "S. Cut Off." The route was not established by Sublette, but rather a mountain man named Greenwood. The error in attribution arose when Joseph E. Ware's "Emigrant's Guide to California" (1849) listed the alternate path as the "Sublette Cutoff."

Prince Luís of Orléans-Braganza (1878–1920)

Prince Luís of Orléans-Braganza (January 26, 1878 – March 26, 1920), was an heir to the throne of the Empire of Brazil.
He was born in Brazil, the second son of Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, and Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil.
He was exiled along with his family as the result of the 1889 coup d'état that resulted in the formation of the republic. In 1908, the year he was married, his older brother Pedro resigned his claim to the imperial throne leaving Luís heir apparent. In this role he worked with monarchists in Brazil in several attempts to restore the monarchy.
At the outbreak of World War I he enlisted as an officer with the British Armed Forces and saw action in Flanders where he contracted a virulent form of rheumatism that caused his death at the age of 42. His efforts on behalf of the Allies of World War I saw him decorated by Belgium, France and Great Britain.
Childhood.
Luís was born at Petrópolis on January 26, 1878, to Prince Gaston d'Orléans, Count of Eu, and Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil. His paternal grandparents were Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours, and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, while his maternal grandparents were Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil, and Princess Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies. He was named after his paternal grandfather. His name in full was Luís Maria Filipe Pedro de Alcântara Gastão Miguel Rafael Gonzaga. As the second oldest son of the heiress to the imperial throne of Brazil, he was not expected to one day ascend to the throne.
From a young age he demonstrated a strong and determined personality. While on a trip to Europe with his family, an earthquake occurred on February 23, 1887, and while his older brother Pedro appeared very nervous and cried, Luís simply stood calm and showed no emotions. The differences between him and his oldest brother were well-known. His father wrote in a letter dated February 1889 that Pedro was "so incapable and careless in this" pool with Pedro II "as in everything else." Although Pedro was gentle and likeable, he did not like to study and was often clumsy, while Luís had a strong will, was active and apparently intelligent. Gaston affirmed in another letter, written in March 1890, that "Baby Pedro always notable for laziness and ineptness," while "Luís does the identical course work all by himself with admirable distinction and capacity." The prince very early showed the interest in literature that would result in his authorship of several books about his travels around the world, such as: "Dans les Alps", "Tour d´Afrique", "Where four empires meet" and "Under the Southern Cross".
Luís was always impelled to action thanks to his restless spirit that would take him in his childhood to sports and as an adult to politics. At the height of the campaign for the abolition of slavery in Brazil, he and his brothers published a newspaper in favor of abolitionism in the palace of Petrópolis. When the coup that replaced the monarchy with the republic occurred on November 15, 1889, Isabel preferred to send her children to Petrópolis, where later Luís would remember that "locked up in the palace, they had left us during two long days in the most complete ignorance of what was happening out there" until they were sent back to their parents and then left for forced exile. As they had not been able to take anything with them, except for a few personal objects that they could carry with their hands, the imperial family saw itself in a poor financial situation that was only made worse by Pedro II's refusal to accept the five thousand contos of Réis offered initially by the new republican government. In December 1889, the government stopped the family's income from Brazil. They had no alternative but to accept help from their few friends and from Gaston's father.
In 1890, when Pedro was fifteen years old, Luís thirteen years old and the younger brother Antônio, nicknamed "Totó", their parents and the three boys moved to the outskirts of Versailles. After the death of Pedro II in 1891 the monarchists made various efforts to restore the monarchy in Brazil. However, none of the imperial family provided any kind of aid or even words of explicit support. Luís's older brother, Pedro, reached the age of majority in 1893, but he had no capacity and much less desire to assume the monarchist cause. In the same year he left for Vienna, capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to study in the military school at Wiener Neustadt. According to his own mother it was "clear that he must do something and a military career seems to us the only one he should follow". Luís and his brother Antônio followed their older brother at the same military school.
Adulthood.
By 1896, Pedro was in love with Austro-Hungarian noblewoman Elisabeth "Elsi" Dobržensky. Meanwhile, Luís was ambitious and active, eager to make his mark on the world. He was a mountaineer, and climbed Mont Blanc in September 1896. He traveled to southern Africa,central Asia and India, and later wrote and published travelogues of his experiences. Luís was seen by his parents as the only member of the Imperial family capable of helping the monarchist movement in Brazil.
After he returned to France in 1907 he planned an ambitious project to defy the decree banishing the imperial family from Brazil by travelling to Rio de Janeiro. His sudden arrival created an uproar in the old imperial capital having been widely notified in newspapers. It also caused difficulties for Brazilian politicians by placing the imperial family at the center of attention and many Brazilians went to welcome him. However, Luís was prevented from disembarking and was not allowed to set foot on his native land by the republican government. Nonetheless, he sent his mother a telegram saying: "Hindered of disembarking by the Government, I greet the Redeemer of Slaves on the bay of Guanabara in the eve of May 13." Some time later he wrote about his experiences on this trip in the book "Under the Southern Cross" ("Sob o cruzeiro do sul") published in 1913.
Luís became engaged to his cousin Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a granddaughter of a brother of Luís's maternal grandmother, Teresa Cristina. Meanwhile, his brother Pedro, then the heir to Isabel, desired to marry Elizabeth Dobržensky. His mother disapproved of the marriage because Elizabeth was part of the minor nobility rather than royalty. Isabel agreed to accept the marriage with the condition that Pedro would renounce his position as heir. Pedro had no interest in becoming emperor and so he renounced his rights to the succession on October 30, 1908.
I Prince Pedro de Alcântara Luís Filipe Maria Gastão Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga of Orléans and Braganza, having maturely reflected, have resolved to renounce the right that, by the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, promulgated on March 25, 1824, accords to me the Crown of that nation. I declare, therefore, that by my free and spontaneous will I hereby renounce, in my own name, as well as for any and all of my descendants, to all and any rights that the aforesaid Constitution confers upon us to the Brazilian Crown and Throne, which shall pass to the lines which follow mine, conforming to the order of succssion as established by article 117. Before God I promise, for myself and my descendants, to hold to the present declaration.
Cannes October 30, 1908 signed: Pedro de Alcântara of Orléans-Braganza
This renunciation was followed by a letter from Isabel to royalists in Brazil:
November 9, 1908, of Eu
Most Excellent Gentlemen Members of the Monarchist Directory,
With all my heart I thank you for the congratulations upon the marriages of my dear children Pedro and Luís. Luís' took place in Cannes on day 4 with the brilliance that is desired for so solemn an act in the life of my successor to the Throne of Brazil. I was very pleased. Pedro's shall take place next on day 14. Before the marriage of Luís he signed his resignation to the crown of Brazil, and here I send it to you, while keeping here an identical copy. I believe that this news must be published as soon as possible (you gentlemen shall do it in the way that you judge to be more satisfactory) in order to prevent the formation of parties that would be a great evil for our country. Pedro will continue to love his homeland, and will give all possible support to his brother. Thank God they are very united. Luís will engage actively in everything with respect to the monarchy and any good for our land. However, without giving up my rights I want that he be up to date on everything so that he may prepare himself for the position which with all my heart I desire that one day he will hold. You may write to him as many times as you may want to so that he shall be informed of everything. My strength is not the same as it once was, but my heart is still the same to love my homeland and all those who are so dedicated to us. I give you all my friendship and confidence,
The marriage of Luís and Maria Pia was celebrated on November 4 at Cannes, and that of Pedro and Elizabeth ten days later at Versailles. From the union of Luís and Maria Pia three children were born: Pedro Henrique, who became the direct successor to Princess Isabel and Head of the Imperial House of Brazil after her death in 1921; Luís Gastão, and Pia Maria. Isabel did not take long to reveal her opinion about her grandchildren and wrote in a letter in 1914: "I am sending enclosed a photograph of myself with my grandchildren by Luís. Pedro Henrique is growing continually and is a very intelligent child. His grandparents have a particular love for their darling little grandchildren."
Political activity.
With the renunciation of the throne by his brother, Luís could finally collaborate effectively with the Brazilian monarchic movement, assuming clearly his position as heir to the throne (after his mother) and trying to assume the leadership of the restoration campaign. His efforts to reverse the damage caused by the imperial family's inertia was valued by their supporters, and in 1909 he presented a political manifest to the Brazilian monarchists with the intent to restart the stalled campaign. He had some success as he was able to congregate coreligionists in several states of Brazil. Some of the letters from the prince reveal his plans to restore the monarchy, such as the one written for Martim Francisco de Andrada III:
[..."it costs me so much to be here with crossed arms, when I think that a handful of determined men would be enough to pull out our Fatherland from the claws of the adventurers who explore it".
"I still do not know what will be your attitude in the matter of the candidacies. As for me, I judge both the candidates 'undesirable'; but as we have to choose, I would pick Rui "", whose partisans represent the element more reasonable and with bigger prestige in the country. It seems to me that we could use to advantage of the moment for an agreement with the members of this group in order to obtain a common effort for the restoration just after the presidential elections. What are your thoughts on it?"
The prince was active from 1907 through to his death in 1920, and argued in favor of federalism, obligatory military service and an improvement in the quality of life for laborers. In the first case, he was in favor of a greater degree of decentralization and economical and political freedom for the Brazilian states. In the second, he refuted the old custom of enlistment to the armed forces based on individuals coming only from particular sectors of society in favor of a truly professional military force formed by elements of all parts of society. The third, and more important case, was his proposal for a monarchy supported by social legislation that could make better conditions for Brazilian laborers possible.
Luís defended ideas that were well ahead of his time and the necessity to guarantee worthy conditions of subsistence for the Brazilian workers would only be observed thirty years later during the dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas. At the beginning of the twentieth century, neither the government nor Brazilian politicians admitted even the possibility of such basic rights as vacations, right to strike, and weekly maximum hours of work, amongst others. He said that "we monarchists must convince the laborers that the truth is that in the case of a restoration their situation could only improve". The progressive vision of Luís made him a target for accusations of being a "socialist" and a "radical" when, in reality, his intent was to hinder the work force from adhering to socialism, communism, or even anarchism.
World War I and final years.
The start of World War I in August 1914 and the invasion of France by Germany made it possible for Luís to once more prove his idealism and activism as, in his own words, he was a "soldier heart and soul". He and his brother Antônio wanted to defend the homeland of their ancestors. As it was forbidden by law for them to serve in the French armed forces they both enlisted in the British armed forces as officers. Luís went to the army while Antônio served as a pilot in the air force.
While fighting in the trenches of Flanders in 1915 Luís contracted an aggressive type of bone rheumatism that left him very weak and incapable of walking. The prince was invalided out of active service seriously ill and taken to safety in order to be able to recover from the disease. As a consequence of his actions in the conflict and for his bravery, Luís received several decorations: Military medal of the Yser, from King Albert I of Belgium; Legion of Honour, in the degree of knight, and the Cross of War from the French government; the British War Medal, the Victory Medal and Star from the Great Britain. The serious illness contracted in the trenches proved resistant to all treatments and his health gradually deteriorated until he died on March 26, 1920. As his mother lived until 1921, her successor in pretense to the throne of Brazil was her grandson, Pedro Henrique, Luís's son.
Children.

Charlotte–Genesee Lighthouse

The Charlotte–Genesee Lighthouse is an 1822 stone octagonal lighthouse in the Charlotte neighborhood in northern Rochester, New York, United States. The 40 ft tower is located on Lake Ontario at the mouth of the Genesee River. It originally had 10 whale oil Argand lamps, which were replaced with a Fresnel lens in 1853
On February 28, 1881, the lighthouse was turned off. After nearby piers changed the mouth of the river, it was far from the water. The light was then moved to a pier in 1884.
In 1965, Charlotte High School students started a letter writing campaign to save the lighthouse from impending destruction. It was declared surplus in 1981 by the government. It is now owned by Monroe County and managed as a museum by the Charlotte Genesee Lightouse Historical Society, a nonprofit volunteer organization. 
It is part of the Seaway Trail, a National Scenic Byway. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also a City of Rochester Landmark. It is open to the public.

Mangifera indica

Mangifera indica is a species of mango in the Anacardiaceae family. It is found in the wild in India and cultivated varieties have been introduced to other warm regions of the world. It is the largest fruit-tree in the world, capable of a height of one-hundred feet and an average circumference of twelve to fourteen feet, sometimes reaching twenty.
The species appears to have been domesticated about 4,000 years ago. The species was brought to East Asia around 400-500 BCE from India; next, in the 15th century to the Philippines; and then, in the 16th century to Africa and Brazil by the Portuguese. The species was described for science by Linnaeus in 1753.
Mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines. It finds mention in the songs of 4th century CE Sanskrit poet Kalidasa. Prior to that, it is believed to have been tasted by Alexander (3rd century BCE) and Chinese pilgrim Hieun Tsang (7th century CE). Later in 16th century Mughal Emperor, Akbar planted 100,000 mango trees in Darbhanga, Bihar at a place now known as "Lakhi Bagh".
Chemical constituents.
Mangiferin (a pharmacologically active flavonoid, a natural xanthone C-glycoside) is extracted from Mango at high concentrations from the young leaves (172 g/kg), bark (107 g/kg), and from old leaves (94 g/kg). Allergenic urushiols are present in the fruit peel and can trigger contact dermatitis in sensitised individuals. This reaction is more likely to occur in people who have been exposed to other plants from the Anacardiaceae family, such as poison oak and poison ivy, which are widespread in the United States. 
Traditional medicine.
In ayurveda, it is used in a Rasayana formula (q.v.), clearing digestion and acidity due to pitta (heat), sometimes with other mild sours and shatavari (Asparagus racemosus) and guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia). In this oriental system of traditional medicines, varied medicinal properties are attributed to different parts of the mango tree, both as food and medicine. It is anti-diuretic, anti-diarrheal, anti-emetic and cardiac herb.

List of Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Opening Day starting pitchers

The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in Anaheim, California. They play in the American League West division. The franchise has also gone by the names "Los Angeles Angels", "California Angels" and "Anaheim Angels" at various points in its history. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Angels have used 25 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 51 seasons. The 25 starters have a combined Opening Day record of 26 wins, 18 losses and 7 no decisions. No decisions are awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game. It can also result if a starting pitcher does not pitch five full innings, even if his team retains the lead and wins.
Mike Witt has the most Opening Day starts for the Angels, with five. He has a record of one win and three losses, with one no decision in those starts. Frank Tanana, Mark Langston and Chuck Finley have all made four Opening Day starts for the Angels. Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan, Bartolo Colón and Jered Weaver have each made three such starts for the Angels.
Nolan Ryan has the Angels record for most wins in Opening Day starts with three. He also has the best win–loss record in Opening Day starts for the Angels, which is 3–0. The other Angels pitchers with multiple wins in Opening Day starts without a loss are Ken McBride and Andy Messersmith. Mike Witt has the record for most losses in Opening Day starts for the Angels with three. Frank Tanana and Chuck Finley each had two such losses.
The Angels have played in three home ball parks. They played their first season in Wrigley Field, which was designed to look like Wrigley Field in Chicago, but never played an Opening Day home game there. In 1962, they moved to Dodger Stadium, but only stayed there through 1965. They played two Opening Day games at Dodger Stadium, winning once and losing once. The Angels finally moved to Angel Stadium of Anaheim in 1966, which was first called Anaheim Stadium, then subsequently renamed Edison International Field of Anaheim later. They have played 29 Opening Day games there, and their starting pitchers have 15 wins and 12 losses with 2 no decisions. This makes their record at home in Opening Day games 15 wins and 13 losses with 2 no decisions. In Opening Day games on the road, their starting pitchers have a record of 10 wins and 5 losses with 5 no decisions.
The Angels have played in one World Series championship in their history, which they won in 2002. Jarrod Washburn was the Angels Opening Day starting pitcher that season. The Angels lost that Opening Day game to the Cleveland Indians. The winning pitcher for the Indians in that game was Bartolo Colón, who would make three Opening Day starts for the Angels later in his career.

In the Flesh (1977 Pink Floyd 'Animals' tour)

The In the Flesh Tour, also known as "Animals Tour", was a concert tour by the English rock band Pink Floyd in support of their album "Animals". It was divided in two legs, one in Europe and another in North America. The tour featured large inflatable puppets, as well as a pyrotechnic "waterfall", and one of the biggest and most elaborate stages to date, including umbrella-like canopies that would raise from the stage to protect the band from the elements.
History.
Pink Floyd's market strategy for the In the Flesh Tour was very aggressive, filling pages of "The New York Times" and "Billboard" magazine. To promote their four-night run at Madison Square Garden in New York City, there was a Pink Floyd parade on 6th Avenue featuring pigs and sheep.
This was the first tour since their 1973 tour that Pink Floyd didn't use female backing singers. The musicians that augmented the band for the tour was sax player Dick Parry (who occasionally played keyboards out of view of the audience) and guitarist Snowy White, who also played bass on "Sheep" and "Pigs (Three Different Ones)" while Waters played acoustic guitar.
In the first half of the show, the band played all of the "Animals" album in a slightly different sequence to the album, starting with "Sheep" then "Pigs on the Wing (Part I)", "Dogs", "Pigs on the Wing (Part II)" and "Pigs (Three Different Ones)". During "Pigs (Three Different Ones)", Waters would shout the number of the concert on the tour (such as "1-5!" for the fifteenth show) so recordings of the shows would be easy to distinguish from each other. The second half of the show comprised the "Wish You Were Here" album in its exact running order ("Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I–V)", "Welcome to the Machine", "Have a Cigar", "Wish You Were Here" and "Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI–IX)"). The encores were "Money" and often "Us and Them" from "The Dark Side of the Moon". At the Oakland, California show on 9 May they played "Careful with That Axe, Eugene" as a third encore, the first time it had been played since 1974 and the last time it was ever performed. The final night of the tour on 6 July at Montreal's Olympic Stadium had a third encore of "More Blues" which saw David Gilmour sit out the final encore as he was unhappy with the band's performance that night. Snowy White played a bluesy guitar solo with the rest of Pink Floyd in Gilmour's place.
During the tour Waters began to exhibit increasingly aggressive behaviour, and would often yell abusively at disruptive audiences who wouldn't stop yelling and screaming during the quieter numbers. In the New York shows they had to use local workers as lighting technicians due to union problems with their own crew. They had several difficulties with the workers; for example, Waters once had to beckon one of the spotlights to move higher when it only illuminated his lower legs and feet while he was singing.
The Montreal show, 6 July 1977, the final performance of the tour, ended with Pink Floyd performing a blues jam as the roadies dismantled the instruments in front of the insatiable audience who refused to let the band leave the stadium. A small riot at the front of the stage followed the band's eventual exit. Earlier that night, Waters spat in the face of a disruptive fan; "The Wall" grew out of Waters' thoughts about this incident, particularly his growing awareness that stardom had alienated him from his audience.
Although the "Animals" album had not been as commercially successful as the previous two, the band managed to sell out arenas and stadiums in America and Europe, setting scale and attendance records. In Chicago, the band played to an estimated audience of 95,000; in Cleveland and Montreal, they set attendance records for those venues by playing to over 80,000 people.

Songs (Fra Lippo Lippi album)

Songs is the third studio album by Norwegian pop rock group Fra Lippo Lippi. Originally released in 1985 by the band's own label, Easter Productions, "Songs" received favorable reviews and sold around 5,000 copies without any means of promotion.
Later that year, Virgin Records signed the band to a worldwide contract. The album was reissued and released internationally in 1986 with some songs re-recorded or remixed and the addition of the song "Everytime I See You". "Shouldn't Have to Be Like That", "Everytime I See You" and "Come Summer" were released as singles in Europe, while "Everytime I See You" and "The Distance Between Us" became popular hits in the Philippines. This version of the album also sold 20,000 copies in Norway.
The sleeve photography by Reinhard Wolf shows the medieval alcazar of Molina de Aragon in Spain.
Positive response from critics and sales performance of "Songs" prompted Virgin Records to have the band work on a follow-up album. Unfortunately, by the time "Light and Shade" was released in 1988, Virgin Records dropped the band.
In 2005, the album was reissued by band founder Rune Kristoffersen's label Rune Arkiv. It features the original 1985 Easter Productions recordings (as the 1986 release is still property of Virgin Records) plus the live album "Crash of Light", which was previously released only in the Philippines.

UXU Ranch

The UXU Ranch is a historic dude ranch in Shoshone National Forest near Wapiti, Wyoming. The ranch began as a sawmill, as early as 1898. In 1929 Bronson Case "Bob" Rumsey obtained a permit from the U.S. Forest Service to operate a dude ranch on the property, using the sawmill headquarters building, a lodge, and tent cabins. Most of the current structures were built in the 1920s and 1030s from lumber milled on the site.
Initial accommodations were tent cabins, with permanent cabins built in the 1930s from local lumber sawn on site. For much of the ranch's history the only access to the lodge and cabins from the road was across a footbridge. A camelback truss bridge was relocated to the site in 1969 to provide vehicular access. The ranch has changed hands a number of times since the Bronson's tenure, but remains one of the most authentic examples of a working dude ranch in Wyoming.
The main lodge dates to the late 1920s. The irregular one story log building stands on a concrete and stone foundation. The lodge borrows details from the Old Faithful Inn for the entrance porch and deck. The interior features peeled log finishes. Guest cabins are typically log cabins on stone foundations. Other buildings from the period of significance include an outhouse and a root cellar.
The ranch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. It continues to operate as a guest ranch.

Calvin Newton

Calvin Newton, born in 1929, is a Gospel music singer and pioneering Contemporary Christian music personality from West Frankfort, Illinois.
Youth.
Newton was a boy soprano who took up amateur boxing because he was tired of being bullied. Newton won a Kentucky Golden Gloves championship, retiring one opponent in just 23 seconds.
Music career.
In his late teens Newton was recruited to join the Blackwood Brothers, then a prominent gospel quartet. From 1953 until 1956 Newton sang lead for the Oak Ridge Boys, and later he was a co-founder of the Sons of Song, one of the first pioneering acts in what would become the CCM industry. (Please note that the correct name between 1953 and 1956 was the Oak Ridge Quartet.)
Criminal career.
According to biographer Russ Cheatham, Newton was "super-handsome, athletic, and charged with sexual charisma...Audacious, Newton never turned down a dare... -- reckless driving, heavy romancing, and addictive pill popping." Later Newton would spend decades involved in crime: serving time in state and federal prisons for a variety of crimes including theft, counterfeiting, and drug offenses.
Redemption.
In his seventh decade, under the discipleship of gospel legend Jake Hess, who he described as the one who "stood by him when most gospel singers abandoned him," Newton would end his estrangement from the gospel community, eventually reconciling with dozens of former colleagues and appearing in a Bill Gaither-produced gospel performance video titled "All Day Singing and Dinner on the Grounds" and touring with Gaither's traveling gospel music show.

Passers-by removed her from the car prior to the other car bursting into flames. Ambulance officers transported her to Inverell District Hospital for treatment. Robertson said that she had no memory of the accident, nor of the two weeks after the incident, but praised medical staff for her treatment.
She is currently the chair of the Standing Committee on Law and Justice. The committee delivered a report on court proceedings involving children criminal defendants. The committee recommended that the names of children who commit crimes should continue to be suppressed so the "stigma of being associated with a crime” would not get in the way of the child’s future rehabilitation 
In 2008, Robertson came out in support of besieged Federal politician Belinda Neal signing an open letter with eight other female politicians condemning the media over their treatment of Neal.
On the first day of the new Rees Government, she asked a Dorothy Dixer question but addressed it to the wrong Government Minister.

Ariaeus

Ariaeus (fl. 401-394 BC) was a Persian general who fought alongside Cyrus the Younger at the Battle of Cunaxa and later was involved in the assassination of Tissaphernes.
Life.
Ariaeus appears in historic records in 401 BC, in Xenophon's description of the events leading up to the Battle of Cunaxa. Xenophon noted that he was a friend of Cyrus and was said to be fond of young boys, which was why he was an intimate of the young Thessalian general Menon. 
At the Battle of Cunaxa he was Cyrus' second in command and commanded the left. According to Ctesias, he was alongside Cyrus, when Cyrus succeeded in wounding Artaxerxes, but this is unlikely. This would put him on the right alongside Cyrus, and Xenophon and Diodorus both agree he was on the left, which would have been some distance away. 
As soon as Ariaeus discovered that Cyrus was slain in battle, he retreated with the surviving Persian troops. After the battle he offered to wait and return with the surviving Greek soldiers. Clearchus, speaking on behalf of the Greek soldiers, who considered themselves the victors in the battle, sent him a message to offer him the throne of Persia, but he declined. The Greeks then met up with Ariaeus and his Persian troops and they both agreed not to betray each other, and Ariaeus promised to lead them safely out of Persia. 
Subsequently, Tissaphernes, promising Artaxerxes he would destroy the Greek troops entirely, persuaded the king to come to terms with Ariaeus, if Ariaeus would help betray the Greeks. Tissaphernes met with Ariaeus and persuaded him to join him, and Tissaphernes and Ariaeus led the Greeks to believe that they and Artaxerxes were willing to make peace with them and lead them to safety. Clearchus, Menon and three other generals (Agis of Arcadia, Socrates of Achaea and Proxenus of Boetia) along with 20 officers and some 200 troops later met with Tissaphernes on apparently cordial terms. 
At a given signal, the officers and as many of the troops as could be caught were killed and all the generals were captured. They were then taken to Artaxerxes and killed. Some of the surviving soldiers found their way to the Greek encampment and, in response to their news, the remaining Greeks started preparing to attack the Persians. Ariaeus was immediately sent to assuage the Greeks. Ariaeus told the Greeks that only Clearchus has been killed, for reason of treachery, and tried to persuade them to lay down their arms, which the Greeks were reluctant to do. The surviving Greeks eventually decided to leave the camp and find their way out of Persia and return to Greece. Ariaeus joined Tissaphernes in an unsuccessful pursuit of the Greeks.
Ariaeus is next recorded in 395 BC when he was involved in the assassination of Tissaphernes. Diodours refers to him as a satrap, which is probably a mistake, since he appeared to be reporting to Tissaphernes, who was the satrap of Sardis at that time. Artaxerxes grew angry with Tissaphernes' incompetence in his battles with the Greeks, perhaps even suspecting him of betrayal, and ordered his vizier Tithraustes to kill him. Ariaeus was ordered to assist. So Ariaeus invited Tissaphernes to visit him at his residence in Colossae in Phrygia to discuss important business. Tissaphernes was unsuspicious, leaving behind his bodyguard. When he arrived he set aside his sword and went into a bath. Ariaeus' men seized him there and sent him to Tithraustes by covered carriage, where he was soon after beheaded.
Tithraustes was given Tissaphernes' former satrapy of Sardis and when Tithraustes' left to visit Artaxerxes in the late summer of 395 BC, he left Ariaeus and Passiphernes as generals in charge of Sardis. In the winter of 395-394 BC Ariaeus was visited there by Spithridates, who may have been trying to interest him in joining in rebellion against the king. Xenophon says that Spithridates put his trust in Ariaeus because he had already revolted against the king, which could have been a reference to Ariaeus' involvement in Cyrus the Younger's rebellion against Artaxerxes in 401 BC or perhaps may have suggested that Ariaeus was again in open rebellion.

Jules Henri de Sibour

Jules Gabriel Henri de Sibour (December 23, 1872–November 4, 1938) was a French architect who worked in Washington, DC.
Life.
Born in Paris, France, to Vicomte Gabriel de Sibour and Mary Louisa Johnson of Belfast, Maine, he came to the United States as a child and attended St. Paul's School in New Hampshire. He received a degree from Yale University in 1896, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He then worked with Ernest Flagg and Bruce Price in New York before returning to Paris to study at the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1898, he married Margaret Marie Clagett, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William H. Clagett, of Washington, DC and had three sons: Henri Louis, Jacques Blaise, and Jean Raymond.
Career.
After Bruce Price died in May 1903, de Sibour inherited the practice and continued to work under the name of Bruce Price & de Sibour. From 1908 to 1911, de Sibour maintained offices in both New York and Washington, D.C.; then, a year after moving to the District of Columbia in 1910, de Sibour closed his New York office. From 1908 through 1922, de Sibour maintained an office in the Hibbs Building, then moved to the Edmonds Building in 1923.
Although de Sibour’s most prominent works are grand dwellings and embassy buildings, such as the Embassy of Uzbekistan at 1746 Massachusetts Avenue, he also designed dozens of office buildings, apartment buildings, and a diverse range of structures. In 1910, de Sibour designed The Investment Building, a nine-story bank and office, constructed by J. L. Marshall at 15th Street and K Street NW. The same year he designed the McLachlen Building at 1001 G St., NW. In 1911, be designed a nine-story office building at 1512 H Street NW and in 1912, a four-story apartment building at 1409 15th Street NW and a five-story apartment building at 1785 Massachusetts Avenue NW. In 1922, de Sibour designed an apartment building, remarkably similar to his design for the 1922 Hamilton Hotel, at 1200 16th Street NW that was later converted to become the Jefferson Hotel. In 1923, J.H. deSibour also designed the Lee House, an eight-story hotel at the northwest corner of 15th Street and L Street NW, for the Kenwood Corporation.
Working in the Beaux-Arts style throughout his career, de Sibour’s buildings are characterized by their extensive applied decoration and the French influence in their design. Additional notable buildings include the Chevy Chase Club, the University Club, the Chase's Theater and Riggs Building, W. B. Hibbs and Company Building and the Federal-American National Bank . He also designed the French Embassy at 2221 Kalorama Road NW, the Wilkins Residence serving as the Peruvian Chancery at 1700 Massachusetts Avenue NW, the Moore Residence serving as the Uzbekistan Chancery at 1746 Massachusetts Avenue NW, and the Stewart Residence serving as the Embassy of Luxembourg at 2200 Massachusetts Avenue NW.

TA Ranch Historic District

The TA Ranch was the site of the principal events of the Johnson County Range War in 1892. The TA was established in 1882 as one of the first ranches in Johnson County, Wyoming. The TA is the only intact site associated with the range war, with trenches used by both sides still visible and scars on the nearby buildings. The ranch also documents the expansion and development of cattle ranching in Wyoming. 
Description.
The ranch is located near the North Branch of Crazy Woman Creek south of Buffalo, Wyoming, with the Big Horn Mountains to the west. The property is significant for both its role as the scene of a three-day siege in the Johnson County Range War and as an example of an intact ranching operation.
Significant buildings include:
Other contributing structures include a granary, a garage, outhouses and a hen house.
Of particular note are the bunkers or breastworks built during the 1892 siege. The cattlemen's hired guns dug trenches on an elevated location to the west of the barn that commanded a view of the surrounding country. The local ranchers, homesteaders and townspeople who surrounded them built their own breastworks around the ranch. At least ten breastworks were built and three remain.
History.
The ranch was established in 1882 by Dr. William Harris of Laramie, who had purchased the brand and herd of Tom Alsop, also of Laramie. Harris moved the herd to Johnson County to set up the TA Ranch, remaining in Laramie to continue his medical practice, with Charles Ford as ranch manager. As such, Harris was an absentee landowner and was politically aligned with the larger cattle barons. In 1892 a party of hired guns paid by the Wyoming Stockmen's Association embarked on a raid to hunt down "rustlers" who were supposedly stealing cattle from the stockmen. However, the mercenary company was resented by the smaller landowners prevalent in northern Wyoming and were confronted by a large group of local settlers and cowboys. The gunmen (frequently referred to as "invaders") retreated to the TA Ranch, which they proceeded to fortify. Soon, about fifty invaders were surrounded by almost four hundred locals. The invaders were rescued by U.S. Cavalry from Fort McKinney on the third day of the siege.
Harris traded the ranch to J.P. Gammon for another property in 1904, and Gammon used the TA to raise Percheron draft horses. In the 1920s Gammon started to raise Hereford cattle and expanded the ranch to raise hogs. The ranch changed hands to the Long Brothers in 1979, followed by several other changes of ownership.
The ranch is presently operated as a guest ranch and conference center.

Jacksonia scoparia

Jacksonia scoparia, commonly known as dogwood (from its strong odour when burning), is a native species of a pea-flowered, greyish, leafless, broom-like shrub or small tree that occurs in the south east of Queensland, Australia and eastern New South Wales. It is often seen growing on high exposed ridges in and around the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park on the Northern Tablelands (New South Wales). The yellow 'pea'-type flowers appear in October and November in racemes from the upper branches. 
During droughts, dogwood has provided a useful fodder that is relished by cattle. Propagation is relatively easy from seed following pre-treatment with boiling water (similar to other members of the pea family). Cuttings also strike reasonably readily.

Following the success of the 1985 album "Songs", Virgin Records had the band work on a follow-up album with the US as its intended target market. The first single "Angel" received moderate airplay on a radio station in Los Angeles. However, during this time, the US arm of Virgin Records dropped several artists off their roster — Fra Lippo Lippi being one of them. Frustrated by the album's failure to capture the US market, the band parted ways with Virgin Records in 1988.

Gregory, Western Australia

Gregory is a small town and fishing port in the Mid West region of Western Australia. At the 2006 census, Gregory had a population of 46.
Port Gregory, located close to the mouth of the Hutt River, was established in 1849 and named after brothers Augustus and Frank Gregory, two of Western Australia's most active explorers. In May 1853 sixty convicts and Pensioner Guards arrived from England via Fremantle in the ships "Leander" and "GoldDigger". A townsite was gazetted in 1854 as Pakington near the shore with Lynton gazetted as the convict depot and townsite for the Guards inland on the Hutt River inland. The convicts were utilised for Government works and in establishing a road to the Murchison River and the Geraldine lead mine operated by Cornish miners during the 1850s. Ticket-of-leave men from the depot were hired out for work at the port and on nearby farms and stations. 
A major employer was Captain H.A Sanford who as Magistrate for the region and the Superintendent of Convicts built an impressive homestead alongside Lynton. He resigned in 1854 and took up pastoral and whaling pursuits, establishing a whaling facility just north of the Pakington townsite. John Bateman and others also established whaling facilities nearby. The name Pakington was rarely used however and the name Port Gregory which is the harbour located next to the town, was more generally accepted. Initially the port was used by whalers and pastoralists and to ship Lead from the mines (notably the Geraldine mine operated by miners who were part of the Cornish diaspora in the 19th century) in the Murchison region during the 1850s. Salt from nearby Hutt Lagoon was shipped until the depression when the port and both the 'towns' became deserted. In being unwilling to bombard the nearby port of Geraldton due to a large number of aircraft visible from his submarine, the Captain of IJN "I 165" bombarded Port Gregory in January 1943 in the mistaken belief it was still occupied. The bombardment was one example of German and Japanese attacks on Australia during World War II. There are many ship wrecks in the vicinity most caused by the unsuitability of the port for large vessels. These include trading and whaling vessels and an iron ship, the SS Xantho which sank after being overloaded with lead ore from the Geraldine mine. 
The townsite changed its name to Gregory in 1967.

Air Force Global Strike Command

Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) is a Major Command (MAJCOM) of the United States Air Force, headquartered at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. AFGSC provides combat-ready forces to conduct strategic nuclear deterrence and global strike operations in support of combatant commanders.
Air Force Global Strike Command is the direct descendant unit of the Cold War-era Strategic Air Command. It holds the lineage, history and honors of SAC.
Overview.
AFGSC was established for the improvement of the management of the United States' nuclear arsenal. It assumed responsibility for the nuclear-capable assets of Air Force Space Command on 1 December 2009 and the nuclear-capable assets of Air Combat Command on 1 February 2010. Its creation was outlined in the recommendations of the investigation following the 2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident. The command was activated 7 August 2009, at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana,
The mission of Air Force Global Strike Command is to "Develop and provide combat-ready forces for nuclear deterrence and global strike operations --Safe --Secure --Effective to support the President of the United States and combatant commanders."
AFGSC consists of approximately 23,000 personnel assigned to six wings, two geographically-separated squadrons and one detachment in the continental United States and deployed to locations around the globe.
Units.
The Command has an area of responsibility (AOR) which includes Barksdale, Malmstrom, Minot, FE Warren, and Whiteman Air Force Bases.
Eighth Air Force.
Headquarters, Eighth Air Force – Barksdale AFB, Louisiana
Eighth Air Force is designated as U.S. Strategic Command's Task Force 204, providing on-alert, combat-ready forces to the president. The mission of "The Mighty Eighth" is to safeguard America's interests through strategic deterrence and global combat power. Eighth Air Force controls long-range nuclear-capable bomber assets throughout the United States and overseas locations. Its flexible, conventional and nuclear deterrence mission provides the capability to deploy forces and engage enemy threats from home station or forward positioned, anywhere, any time. The 8th Air Force motto is "Deterrence through strength, global strike on demand."
The B-2 Spirit is a long-range nuclear and conventional stealthy bomber. The bomber can fly at high subsonic speeds at altitudes that can reach 50,000 feet. Its unrefueled range is at least 6,000 nautical miles. The B-2 brings massive firepower, in a short time, anywhere on the globe through the most challenging defenses.
The B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range, nuclear and conventional heavy bomber that can perform a variety of missions. The bomber can fly at high subsonic speeds at altitudes reaching 50,000 feet. It has an unrefueled combat range in excess of 8,800 miles. It can carry precision-guided ordnance with worldwide precision navigation.
Twentieth Air Force.
Headquarters, Twentieth Air Force – Francis E. Warren AFB, Wyoming
Twentieth Air Force is responsible for maintaining and operating the Air Force's ICBM force. Designated as STRATCOM's Task Force 214, 20th Air Force provides on-alert, combat-ready ICBMs to the president.
The ICBMs are on 24-hour/365-day alert and are ready to launch on any given day.
AFGSC's 20th Air Force is the Air Force's lead command for and largest operator of UH-1N Huey helicopters. The UH-1N supports ICBM operations in missile fields controlled by F.E. Warren AFB, Malmstrom AFB and Minot AFB.
History.
Following the 2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident and the 2008 incident in which four MK-12 forward-section reentry vehicle assemblies were mistakenly shipped to Taiwan, former Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger led an investigation into the status of U.S. Air Force nuclear surety. Secretary Schlesinger's recommendation was the creation of a single command under which all Air Force nuclear assets should be placed for better accountability. On 24 October 2008, the Secretary of the United States Air Force, Michael Donley, announced the creation of the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) as a new Air Force major command (MAJCOM). Along with Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) at Peterson AFB, Colorado, AFGSC is one of two Air Force component commands reporting to United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) at Offutt AFB, Nebraska.
The new command began operations in August 2009, combining the nuclear-capable strategic bomber force previously operated by Air Combat Command (ACC) and the land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force previously operated by Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).
The USAF currently has 20 B-2 Spirit and 57 B-52 Stratofortress bombers and three missile wings of Minuteman III ICBMs that are designated as nuclear-capable. When needed for conventional missions, the B-2 and B-52 bombers will be reassigned to regional commands. Although formerly assigned a nuclear mission, the B-1 Lancer bomber force transitioned to a strictly conventional mission force and was retained in Air Combat Command.
In November 2008, the USAF announced plans to start a fourth B-52 squadron at Minot Air Force Base to support Air Force Global Strike Command, The USAF added that, "all the nuclear-capable bombers of what is now Eighth Air Force, and of all ICBMs of what is now in Twentieth Air Force, will report to this single new command.". This action was accomplished on 3 September 2009, when the 69th Bomb Squadron (69 BS) reactivated at Minot Air Force Base.
The command's 55-member preliminary team, commanded by Major General James Kowalski, began operations at Bolling Air Force Base on 12 January 2009. The team was charged with finding a location for the new headquarters and transitioning the assigned units into the new command.
In April 2009, the preliminary team selected Barksdale AFB as the headquarters for the new command. Donley stated that the factors which contributed to the selection of Barksdale over the other candidate bases were its connection to the 8th Air Force, a "slightly larger operations center", and the base's hosting of the 11th Bomb Squadron (11 BS), which trains B-52 aircrews and will be adding special emphasis on nuclear training.
On 16 April 2009, United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that Air Force Lieutenant General Frank G. Klotz was nominated to be the first commander of the Global Strike Command. Prior to his assignment to AFGSC, Lt Gen Klotz was the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff and Director of the Air Force Staff.
On 18 June, after an environmental assessment finding of 'No Significant Impact', Barksdale Air Force Base was announced as the permanent location for AFGSC.
On 7 August 2009, the command officially became active with Lt Gen Klotz assuming command of the organization. The headquarters staff includes 900 people, and reached full operational capability by 30 September 2010.
The Twentieth Air Force (20 AF), the service’s missile organization, came under the new command on 1 December 2009, and the Eighth Air Force (8 AF), the bomber component, came under the command on 1 February 2010.

Dreams (Fra Lippo Lippi album)

Dreams is the sixth studio album by Norwegian pop rock group Fra Lippo Lippi.
When their 1989 album "The Colour Album" generated mediocre sales (even in the Philippines, which holds a lion's share of the band's popularity), the band parted ways with their Swedish label The Record Station and were considering breaking up. Instead, they decided to write songs for a new album. In 1991, the band recorded the songs in founder Rune Kristoffersen's basement before sending the tapes to Stockholm, Sweden, for record producer Kaj Erixon (who worked on the band's 1985 album "Songs") to mix them. The album was released by Sonet Records in Norway, Polystar Records in Japan and OctoArts International (now EMI Records Philippines) in the Philippines.
"Dreams" was a moderate hit in the Philippines, with the song "Stitches and Burns" receiving constant airplay on radio. It would be Kristoffersen's final studio album with the band, and the band's last original recording for over a decade. Stitches and Burns Became a Top Hit in the Philippines after 5 months of constant airplay, topping the charts for at least 4 weeks.

Eleanor Vere Boyle

Eleanor Vere Gordon Boyle (1 May 1825 – 29 July 1916) was an English artist and author of the Victorian era. She has been considered the most important female illustrator of the 1860s.
She was born in Scotland, the youngest daughter of Alexander Gordon of Ellon Castle, Aberdeenshire. In 1845 she married Richard Cavendish Boyle (1812–86), a younger son of the 8th Earl of Cork; R. C. Boyle served as the rector of Marston Bigot in Somerset (1836–75) and later as Queen Victoria's chaplain. Because of her social position, she rarely exhibited or sold her artwork — actions that would have been "déclassé" in the standards of her time and place. She did allow a rare exhibition of her art at Leighton House c. 1902. Consistently, in both her visual art and her books, she employed her initials, E. V. B., to mask her identity.
Boyle applied her skill as a watercolorist to illustrate children's books. In 1852, a small volume titled "Child's Play" matched Boyle pictures with traditional nursery rhymes like "Little Boy Blue." She illustrated a wide range of similar books, including Tennyson's "The May Queen" (1860) — she was a friend of the poet — and the fairy tale "Beauty and the Beast" (1875) — she depicted the Beast as a sabre-toothed panther. In 1868 she illustrated Sarah Austen's translation of Friedrich Wilhelm Carové's "The Story Without an End;" and in 1872 she became one of the first British artists to illustrate the stories of Hans Christian Andersen, and set a new standard of quality for Andersen illustration.
Boyle was familiar with many of the Pre-Raphaelites; Dante Gabriel Rossetti called her "great in design." She was a cousin of Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford, another woman artist of her era.
In 1893 Boyle published "A Book of the Heavenly Birthdays", a small aid to meditation that combined her watercolors with poetry by William Morris, Christina Rossetti, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Walter Savage Landor and others. The book provides an example of "the eschatological thrust of much of her work..."
Boyle was interested in garden design; she re-created the Evelyn garden at Huntercombe Manor in Burnham, Buckinghamshire from 1872 on. She wrote books on gardening, like her "Days and Hours in a Garden" (1884), "A Garden of Pleasure" (1895), and "Seven Gardens and a Palace" (1900). Her "The Peacock's Pleasaunce" (1908) is a collection of belle-lettrist essays.
Three of her children, two sons and a daughter, pre-deceased her. She was survived by a son and daughter.

La Chanson de Craonne

La Chanson de Craonne (English: The Song of Craonne) is an anti-military song of World War I written in 1917. The song was written to the tune of "Bonsoir M'Amour" (Charles Sablon), sung by Emma Liebel. It is sometimes known by the first line of the chorus, Adieu la vie (Goodbye to life).
History.
This song was sung by the French soldiers who mutinied (in sixty eight of the one hundred and ten divisions of the French Army) after the costly and militarily disastrous offensive of General Robert Nivelle at the Chemin des Dames, spring 1917.
The song was prohibited in France until 1974. Even though an award of 1 million francs and the immediate honorable release from the army were offered for revealing the maker, the original author of the song remained unknown.
These revolts brought about severe reprimands, notably by General Philippe Pétain, who was named on 17 May as the replacement for General Nivelle. He was directly tasked with the mission of rebuilding the sagging morale of the war-weary French Army. He went about this with the punishment of the leaders of the mutiny, condemning 554 to death, though only 49 were actually executed. He also improved conditions of the soldiers with better food, better cantonments, better organization for military leaves, and suspended the deadly offensives to limit the casualties.
Origin of the Song.
This song was anonymously created, though surely by many authors. The song constantly evolved during the course of the war due to the changing role of those engaged in combat. The song first appeared under the name "La Chanson de Lorette" evoking the Battle of Lorette à Ablain-St. Nazaire that occurred between the twelve months of October 1914 and October 1915. The song was modified in order to sing about the Second Battle of Champagne. In 1916, the song was sung during the ghastly Battle of Verdun, with the refrain:
"Adieu la vie, adieu l'amour, 
Adieu toutes les femmes
C'est pas fini, c'est pour toujours
De cette guerre infâme
C'est à Verdun, au fort de Vaux
Qu'on a risqué sa peau"
La Chanson de Craonne
The final version, "The Song of Craonne" was written in 1917 during the French Army's Mutinies. The village of Craonne on the plateau of Californie was the site of bloody fighting on 16 April 1917 during Nivelle's failed Offensives. It was these bloody offensives that pushed the French Army over the edge.
Verses
English
After the war this song was not allowed at all on French airwaves. The writer Paul Vaillant-Couturier, who was also a World War I veteran, preserved the song, and later had them published.
In film.
The song's chorus is sung in Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), and several versions can be seen or heard on Youtube.

Shortnose gar

The shortnose gar (Lepisosteus platostomus) is a primitive freshwater fish of the family Lepisosteidae. It is native to the United States.
Shortnose gar have a prehistoric-looking appearance. Like many other "lie-in-wait" predators, they have an elongated, torpedo-like body with an elongated head containing one row of sharp, conical teeth. Similar to many Paleozoic and Mesozoic actinopterygians, their bodies are covered in rows of interlocking, rhomboidal ganoid scales that create an exceptionally protective, yet flexible armor around the fish. The dorsal fin is located posterior nearly directly above the anal fin and very near the large caudal fin. Shortnose gar vary in color, changing from brown/olive green on the dorsal surface to yellow on the sides and white on the underbelly. Shortnose gar can be discerned from other gar species in that they lack the upper jaw of the alligator gar, the long snout of the longnose gar, and the markings of the spotted gar. The shortnose gar reaches up to , but a more common length is .
Habitat.
Shortnose gar generally inhabit calm waters in large rivers and their backwaters, as well as oxbow lakes and large, quiet pools, typically around vegetation or downed logs. Gar have the ability to survive in environments with very little oxygen and especially turbid conditions because of their specialized gas bladder. Gar gas bladders have the ability to function like a lung to extract and use oxygen from swallowed air in addition to regulating buoyancy.
Reproduction and life cycle.
Shortnose gar typically spawn in the spring during April, May and June, when water temperatures are between . Often accompanied by more than one male, females scatter large, yellowish-green eggs in quiet, shallow water among submerged vegetation or other underwater structures. A sticky adhesive holds the eggs together in clumps where they hatch after eight to 9 days. The eggs are poisonous to birds and mammals, including humans. The young remain in the yolk sac for another week, where they feed on insect larvae and small crustaceans. Young gar typically lead solitary lives and sexual maturity is achieved around three years of age when the gar reaches about in length.
Diet and habits.
Shortnose gar are efficient, fierce, ambush predators. They feed mainly on fish, but they are very opportunistic and will also eat crayfish, insects, and other invertebrates. Despite feeding mainly on whatever fish are available, shortnose gar eat more invertebrates than any other gar and have even been found to exhibit territorial defense behaviors around favorable pools while foraging on high numbers of periodical cicadas.
Distribution.
Shortnose gar today are only located in North America. Located mainly in the central United States, they occupy much of the Mississippi and Missouri River basins ranging from Montana (in the west) to the Ohio River (in the east) in the north and the Gulf Coast from Louisiana and Alabama to parts of Texas in the south.
Importance to humans.
Shortnose gar help maintain ecosystem equilibrium by feeding on minnows that are destructive to game fish and other fish populations. They are popular aquarium fish, and are frequently found in public aquariums across the country.
Conservation status.
With very few natural predators able to cope with a gar's thick ganoid scale armor, shortnose gar are generally plentiful. One exception is in Montana, where they are considered a fish of special concern due to restricted distribution and limited population sizes.
In Ohio, they are an endangered species because of limited range (primarily the Ohio River and lower Scioto and Great Miami Rivers).
Etymology of name.
In Greek, "Lepisosteus" translates to "bony scale", and "platostomus" translates to "broad mouth".

In a Brilliant White

In a Brilliant White is the seventh studio album by Norwegian group Fra Lippo Lippi; this time, with vocalist Per Øystein Sørensen as the sole member (as bassist/founder Rune Kristoffersen retired to manage his record label). The band's first studio album in more than a decade, which contains mostly Sorensen's works and was initially produced and released only in the Philippines by EMI Music Philippines in 2002.
"Later" became a hit in the Philippines even before the album was released, receiving massive airplay on radio and rejuvenated the band's popularity in the Philippines. Hence, EMI Music Philippines (now Polyeast Records) decided to produce a full-length album with it. "Wish We Were Two" was released as a second single, a collaboration between Sorensen and Philippines' R&B Artist Kyla. However, this single did not receive as much local airplay and never charted.
This album was also released in Norway eventually, following releases over other countries in Asia. Carrying the Fra Lippo Lippi name, Sorensen visited the country once again to play sold-out concerts and appearing on MYX TV and other variety shows such as "ASAP".

August Gailit

August Gailit (January 9, 1891 – November 5, 1960) was an Estonian writer. 
Life.
Georg August Gailit was born in Kuiksilla (near Sangaste Castle), Sangaste Parish, Valgamaa, Estonia, the son of a carpenter and grew up on a farm in Laatre (currently Tolle). From 1899 he attended schools in the parish and the town of Valga from 1905, then from 1907 a municipal school in Tartu. From 1911 until 1914 he worked as a journalist in today's Latvia and Estonia in 1916 until 1918. In the Estonian War of Independence he participated as a war correspondent. 
From 1922 until 1924 August Gailit lived in Germany, France and Italy. After that he worked as a freelance writer in Tartu and from 1934 in Tallinn. From 1932 until 1934 he was the director of the Theater Vanemuine in Tartu. 
In 1932 August Gailit married to actress Elvi Vaher-Nander (1898–1981) and his daughter Aili-Viktooria was born in 1933. 
With the Soviet occupation of Estonia, Gailit fled with his family in September 1944 to Sweden, where he worked as a writer. His new was the Ormesta Manor near Örebro. He died there on 5 November 1960 and was buried at the Örebro northern cemetery.
Literary career.
In 1917 August Gailit along with some other writers and poets, founded a literary group called "Siuru" with which their erotic poems caused some scandal. The early prose of Gailit also contained erotic content and satire. Until the middle of the 1920s Gailit was strongly influenced by neo-romanticism. Oswald Spengler and Knut Hamsun also exerted great influence in his work. 
His famous novel "Toomas Nipernaadi" (which was made into a movie in 1983) describes the romantic and adventurous life of a vagabond. 
Some of his novels covered political issues such as the novel "Isade maa" (1935) which addressed the subject of the Estonian 1918-20 war of independence. Gailit's novel "Üle rahutu vee" (published in 1951 in Gothenburg, Sweden) concerns the tragic event of having to leave ones homeland.

<doc id="19928928" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19928928" title="Northern River Street Historic District">
Northern River Street Historic District

The Northern River Street Historic District is located along River Street (southbound US 4 at that point) north of Federal Street, one block east of the Green Island Bridge, in Troy, New York, United States. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, as the Northern River Street District, to distinguish it from Troy's previously existing River Street Historic District, which had been one of five superseded by the Central Troy Historic District to the south two years earlier.
Its two acres (8,000 m²) include 13 brick industrial and commercial buildings erected from the mid-19th to early 20th centuries. They were cut off from the rest of downtown due to the construction of the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad, and as a result became a production center for the city's major industries, primarily textiles. When those industries declined in the mid-20th century, they were further isolated from the city's center by expansion of Federal Street to provide access to the bridge, and various urban renewal efforts. As a result they have not seen much redevelopment and remain mostly intact.
Geography.
The district is defined by building addresses: 403-429 River Street on the west side, and 420-430 River Street on the east. The resulting district is irregularly shaped, taking in all of the west side between Federal and Jacob streets but only the northern half on the east side.
Buildings.
The west side is dominated by 409-415 River Street, a four-story six-bay former warehouse that dates to the 1840s, making it the oldest building in the district. The brownstone pilasters on the storefronts attest to the lingering influence of Greek Revival architecture at the time it was built. Nest door, 417-419 River Street is as tall but only three bays wide, built a decade later with similar design. Next to it is 421-423 River Street, the 1885 Cleminshaw Building of the H.C. Curtis Collar Co. At six bays and five stories, it is the largest building in the district. It boasts an ornate pressed metal cornice with a pediment reading "1868 REBUILT 1884".
At the north end of this row is 425 River Street, a narrower 1892 five-story building showing later influences, with a corbeled brick cornice and molded pediment. The top floor windows are arched; a brick pilaster comes up from beneath to create a rounded arcade. A decorative brick course as well as molded string runs around the building. To its north are two smaller buildings, dating to around 1910, the newest buildings in the district.
To the south of the large warehouses are smaller buildings. At 403 River Street is a three-story building dating to the same period as the warehouses, but 405-407, originally built as the Gaiety Theatre in 1888 and rebuilt with Dutch Colonial Revival stepped gables after a fire twenty years later. 
The west side is dominated by three large three-story brick warehouses all built around 1885. To their north, at 428-430 River Street, is a two-story brick building from ten years later.
History.
The neighborhood was isolated from downtown by the construction of the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad in the 1830s, which ran into Troy on a route paralleling Federal Street from a now-demolished bridge. This, and the river's nearby water power, made it a more desirable location for the commercial detachable-collar factories and warehouses that were opening up as what had been a local cottage industry became the mainstay of the local economy and the product that gave the city an enduring nickname.
Space in the area was limited, and later expansions and additions to the industry found even better facilities available in the city's long northern extension. The railroad tracks were eventually removed when that industry declined along with the collar factories in the 20th century, but the road was expanded to include their right of way. Some of the properties were expanded for different purposes in the 1950s. Local urban renewal efforts in the next two decades also further isolated the area from downtown, but left the remaining River Street buildings intact, preserving them as a transitional block between commercial Troy to the south and industrial Troy to the north.
Today it is not only on the Register, but included as part of the city's Riverfront Historic District. Special zoning ordinances are in place to protect its historic character. It has been redeveloped with small retail outlets and restaurants, such as the River Street Café, upstairs in 429 River Street overlooking the river.

Chana Orloff

Chana Orloff (1888–1968) was a Ukraine-born Israeli figurative sculptor.
Biography.
Chana Orloff was born in Ukraine. She immigrated to Ottoman Palestine in 1905 and settled in Jaffa, where she found a job as a cutter and seamstress. Zvi Nishri (Orloff), the pioneer in physical education in Israel, was her brother. 
She joined Hapoel Hatzair workers movement. After five years in the country, she was offered a teaching position in cutting and dressmaking at Gymnasia Herzliya. She went to Paris to study fashion but chose art instead, enrolled in sculpture classes at the Académie Russe in Montparnasse. In 1916, she married Ary Justman, a Warsaw-born writer and poet. The couple had a son, but Ary died of influenza in the epidemic of 1919. When the Nazis invaded Paris, Orloff fled to Switzerland with her son and the Jewish painter Georges Kars. In February 1945, Kars committed suicide in Geneva, after which Orloff returned to Paris with her son, to find that her house had been ransacked and the sculptures in her studio destroyed.
Orloff died in Israel on December 16, 1968.
Artistic career.
In Paris, Orloff became friendly with other young Jewish artists, among them Marc Chagall, Jacques Lipchitz, Amedeo Modigliani, Pascin, Chaim Soutine, and Ossip Zadkine. In 1913, she exhibited in the Salon d'Automne. After the establishment of the State of Israel, Orloff began spending an increasing amount of time there. The Tel Aviv Museum of Art held an exhibition of 37 of her sculptures in 1949. She remained in Israel for about a year in order to complete a sculpture of David Ben-Gurion, "The Hero Monument" to the defenders of Ein Gev and "The Motherhood Monument" in memory of Chana Tuckman who died during the Israeli War of Independence. In addition to monuments, Orloff sculpted portraits of Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and future Prime Minister Levi Eshkol; the architects Pierre Chareau, and Auguste Perret; painters Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, and Per Krohg; and the poets Hayyim Nahman Bialik, and Pierre Mac Orlan.

Bahía del Carnero (Spanish: Bay of the Sheep) is a cove with little shelter on the coast of the Arauco Province, Bío Bío Region, Chile to the south of the Punta de Lavapié and north of Lebu at 37° 25' S. At its northern end it contains the mouth of Caleta Yani (Yani Creek) and at the southern end, the Caleta Ranquil where it is protected by the promontory of Millonhue. Its coast is low and little forested, and drains the Quiapo River.
It was given its name by the crew of the ship of the expedition of Francisco de Camargo, that visited it in March 1540, and obtained from the Indians there a "sheep", the name they gave to the "chillihueque" or domesticated guanaco. The Mapudungun name of this cove was "Alauquén", from "av", "end", and "lauquen", "the sea".

Murder of Stephanie Kuhen

The murder of Stephanie Kuhen in 1995 in Los Angeles, California, created significant media attention in the United States and led to crackdowns on Los Angeles street gangs.
Incident.
Around 1:45 AM on September 17, 1995, along Isabel Street in the Cypress Park neighborhood, a street nicknamed "Avenida . . . assecinos," an incorrectly spelled Spanish phrase meaning "Street of Killers" or "Avenue of the Assassins," members of The Avenues gang shot at a vehicle containing a family returning from a cookout; according to the prosecution the vehicle made a wrong turn into an alley. A 3-year-old girl named Stephanie Kuhen died, and Kuhen's stepfather and younger brother sustained injuries. The perpetrators were arrested and convicted.
Legal action.
On August 1, 1997, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Edward Ferns sentenced 28-year-old Anthony Gabriel Rodriguez, 22-year-old Manuel Rosales, Jr., and 18-year-old Hugo David Gomez to 54 years and eight months to life in state prison. At that point 17-year-old Augustin Lizama was to be retried. During the sentencing of the three convicted murderers, Margaret Fregoso, Rodriguez's grandmother, defended him and said that people outside of the court speculated that the Kuhen automobile traveled through the neighborhood so one or more occupants could purchase recreational drugs. Robynn Kuhen, the mother of Stephanie Kuhen, said that her family was trying to find a shortcut home and said that Fregoso's statements were not true. The defense in the trial suggested that the Kuhen family knew the layout of the area and would not have found themselves lost in their car. On Friday, August 29, 1997, Lizama agreed to a plea bargain in which he received a conviction for assault.
Rodriguez, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) #K65397, was booked into the CDCR system on September 2, 1997. As of 2010 he is incarcerated at California State Prison, Centinela. Rosales, CDCR#K65037, was booked on August 29, 1997. As of 2013 he is incarcerated at CSP-Los Angeles County. Gomez, CDCR#K65384, was booked on September 2, 1997. As of 2010 he is incarcerated at the California State Prison, Corcoran.
Aftermath.
Several days after the incident, President of the United States Bill Clinton condemned the killing and said that the United States Federal Government would give money to anti-gang efforts. After the Kuhen incident, Mayor of Los Angeles Richard Riordan asked the Criminal Justice Planning Office (CJPO) to create recommendations regarding gang crime. Several months after the Kuhen incident, the task force's suggestions lead to the creation of the Los Angeles City/County Community Law Enforcement and Recovery (CLEAR) program.
Kuhen was buried in a private ceremony on Monday September 25, 1995. About 100 people attended the ceremony.
Analysis.
George Ramos of the "Los Angeles Times" reported that many Cypress Park residents were angered by the negative portrayal of their community in the media; the perceived lack of attention to gang issues from the municipal government and their council member, Mike Hernandez; and the "Los Angeles Times" for posting large images of Stephanie Kuhen and her brother on the front page of the newspaper, stating that the media does not do this with ethnic minority children. Ramos said that the editor of the newspaper had asked for the images of the children to be posted before learning that they were white. Ramos also stated that many Cypress Park residents believed that if one is not from Cypress Park, one should be concerned with crime in his or her own neighborhood rather than in Cypress Park.
Allan Parachini of the American Civil Liberties Union said that the media focused attention on the Kuhen case because the victim was white. George Cotliar, a "Los Angeles Times" managing editor, said that race was not the reason why the media focused attention on the case. Bill Lord, a director at NBC affiliate KNBC, also stated that race was not a factor in why the media covered the Kuhen case. Laurence Elder, a politically conservative African-American talk show host, stated that law enforcement ignored the gangs in Cypress Park since most of the residents were Hispanic and Black.

Edward Robert Harrison

Edward R. "Ted" Harrison (8 January 1919 – 29 January 2007)
was a British astronomer and cosmologist, who spent much of his career at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and University of Arizona, USA. He is noted for his work about the increase of fluctuations in the expanding universe, for his explanation of Olber's Paradox, and for his books on cosmology for lay readers.
Life.
Harrison's education at Sir John Cass Technical Institute was interrupted by World War II (WWII), during which he served for six years with the British Army in various military campaigns, eventually serving as Radar Adviser to the Northern Area of the (British) Egyptian Army.
Following World War II, Harrison became a British civil servant, first with the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, and later at the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory. During this time he attained the equivalent of university degrees, becoming a graduate, then an Associate, and finally a Fellow of the Institute of Physics. He also became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, the American Physical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
In 1965 Ted Harrison went to the USA as a NAS-NRC Senior Research Associate at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, in Maryland. In 1966 he became one of the three founders of the Astronomy Program within the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Over the next 30 years he influenced the revival of the Five College Astronomy Department, linking UMass to Amherst College, Hampshire College, Smith College, and Mount Holyoke College. He also played a key role in the rise to international prominence of the Five College graduate course in astronomy. At his death, he was emeritus Distinguished University Professor of Physics and Astronomy at UMass, and an adjunct professor at the Steward Observatory of the University of Arizona.
Work.
Ted Harrison had broad interests, and he published more than 200 papers, primarily in astrophysics and cosmology, but also in space sciences, high energy physics, plasma physics and physical chemistry. He was an elegant writer with a passion for the history of ideas. His books (cf. especially his text "Cosmology") illustrated points of physics or cosmology with many literary, philosophical, and historical references.
The work of Harrison and of Soviet physicist Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich on structure formation from primordial density perturbations in the cosmic plasma has led to the general use of the term Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum for primordial random fluctuations characterised by a scale-invariant power spectrum.
Harrison was fascinated with Olber's Paradox (the night sky is dark despite the vast number of stars in the universe). In 1964 he published detailed calculations that solved the paradox by concluding that stars do not generate enough energy to illuminate the entire sky. In 1987 he published a book, "Darkness at Night", mulling over the Paradox and its rich history. This book clarified that the lack of energy is not primarily because the universe is expanding, but rather because the stars and galaxies have had only about 15 billion years to radiate, and do not have sufficient energy to keep radiating for much longer. "Darkness at Night" lays out how Harrison discovered that Edgar Allan Poe's essay "" anticipated this conclusion, and that Lord Kelvin had reached a very similar conclusion in a 1901 article ignored for 80 years until Harrison drew attention to it.
Harrison's text "Cosmology: The Science of the Universe" describes the problem of the cosmic edge of the universe by quoting 5th century BC soldier-philosopher Archytas, who questioned what occurs as a spear is hurled across the outer boundary of the universe.
His final book, "Masks of the Universe" (2nd ed., 2003), questions current perceptions of reality, asking whether present cosmology, with ordinary matter, dark matter, plus dark energy, is yet only another "mask" obscuring a Universe which will remain perforce forever unknown to humans.

Oh Me Oh My (I'm a Fool for You Baby)

"Oh Me Oh My (I'm a Fool for You Baby)" is a Top 30 hit for Lulu which charted in 1969–70; the song has been most notably remade by Aretha Franklin and Tina Arena.
Lulu version.
"Oh Me Oh My..." was written by Jim Doris who – as Jimmy Doris – had been vocalist-guitarist for the Stoics, a band which formed in Lulu's native Glasgow in the late 1960s and whose membership had included Frankie Miller. Doris contributed another song to "Oh Me Oh My..."'s parent album "New Routes", entitled "After All (I Live My Life)", and his composition "Take Good Care of Yourself" was featured on the follow-up album "Melody Fair". Reportedly Doris subsequently went into A&R work before being sidelined by mental instability which factored into his being killed when run over by a bus in London in the late 1980s or early 1990s.
The advance single from Lulu's Atco Records debut album "New Routes", "Oh Me Oh My...", was released in October 1969. A radical change of direction for Lulu, who was coming off her best ever UK chart placing at #2 with the Eurovision winner "Boom Bang-a-Bang", the move to a more mature sound with "Oh Me Oh My..." was unappreciated in the UK where the track barely reached the Top 50. In the US, "Oh Me Oh My..." ranked as high as #4 in Birmingham, Alabama in November 1969 but nationally charted only as a moderate Easy Listening hit at #36. Several performances by Lulu on US television helped break "Oh Me Oh My..." into the "Billboard" Hot 100 in December 1969 and then buoy the track as it gradually gained momentum to become Lulu's first Top 30 hit since "To Sir With Love" at the end of February 1970: "Oh Me Oh My..." would peak at #22 that March ("Cash Box" ranked the track with a #18 peak).
In Australia the "Go-Set" Top 40 chart ranked "Oh Me Oh My..." with a #33 peak in January 1970. The "RPM" 100 chart for Canada ranked "Oh Me Oh My..." as high as #16 in March 1970.[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-130-e.html]; that same month the "New Zealand Listener" Pop-o-meter chart ranked "Oh Me Oh My..." as high as #12.1
Lulu recorded a translated version of "Oh Me Oh My..." for release in Italy, entitled "Povera Me"; the track was released in June 1970 to no apparent attention despite a promotional junket by Lulu that July.
Aretha Franklin version.
Aretha Franklin cut a version of "Oh Me Oh My (I'm a Fool For You Baby)" for her 1972 "Young, Gifted and Black" album which like Lulu's "New Routes" was produced by Arif Mardin, Jerry Wexler and Tom Dowd. Franklin's first studio album of new material since "Spirit in the Dark" in 1970, "Young, Gifted and Black" demonstrated Franklin's increasing penchant for covering pop songs and besides Lulu's "Oh Me Oh My..." Franklin gave R&B readings to songs made famous by Dusty Springfield and Dionne Warwick, specifically "A Brand New Me" and "April Fools". "Oh Me Oh My..." was used as the B-side for the album's lead single "Rock Steady", eventually receiving enough focus to reach #9 on the R&B charts crossing over to #73 Pop.
Tina Arena version.
"Oh Me, Oh My" was remade in 2008 by Tina Arena for her "Songs of Love & Loss 2" album recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Hall in London accompanied by conductor Simon Hale and the London Studio Orchestra in July 2008. Arena's version – entitled "Oh Me, Oh My" without the subtitle in parentheses – was issued as the album's single in digital format on November 8, 2008 by EMI Australia.
Other versions.
"Oh Me Oh My (I'm a Fool For You Baby)" has also been recorded by Oleta Adams, Barbara Mason, Bill Medley, Buster Poindexter, Joe Tex, Irma Thomas and – as "Oh Me Oh My" – by Ann Austin, Lloyd Charmers, Renee Geyer, Rod McKuen, Benny Mardones for his 1981 album "Too Much to Lose", The Raes, B.J. Thomas and Lisa Hartman; the last named performed an abbreviated version of the song in the 1981 miniseries "Jacqueline Susann's Valley of the Dolls".

Apega of Nabis

The Apega of Nabis, also known as the Iron Apega, was described by Polybius as an ancient torture device similar to the iron maiden. It was invented by Nabis, a king who ruled Sparta as a tyrant from 207 to 192 BC. 
Device description.
The mechanical Apega, according to Polybius, was a machine, a well-executed replica or duplicate of the real wife of Nabis, and was used by Nabis to collect money from unwilling Spartan citizens. Those who didn't give money were sent to deal with his wife. This was the replica, dressed in expensive clothing, with arms outstretched. When the drunken visitors hugged her, this triggered the arms to close. The device's arms, hands, and breasts were covered with iron nails, and the arms were capable of crushing the body of its victim. Nabis would control the machine through hidden switches and devices, until the victim agreed to pay a tribute or to the point of death.
The automaton, Apega, was one of the advancements in technology of the ancient Greco-Roman world used as implements of torture, along with other torture devices such as the cross, the wheel, and the brazen bull of Phalaris.
Origins.
Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, reportedly created the device in the image of his own wife, Apega (; also known as Ἀγαπήνα or Ἀπία), a tyrant herself who helped in furthering her husband's ambitions. The Greek historian, Polybius (203-120 BC, author of "The Histories"), further described the real Queen Apega as a female ruler who ruled Sparta like a Hellenistic queen, similar to Cleopatra and Arsinoe, because she "received men at court alongside her husband." Polybius also mentioned that she was a woman who knew how to dishonor men by humiliating women belonging to the families of male citizens. Both Nabis and Apega brought suffering and violence to their subjects by stealing their wealth and valuables. 
The historical Apega was described as a Spartan woman who had exceeded her husband's viciousness and wielded power to satisfy her own greed. The Iron Apega was further described as the personification of the evilness and deceitfulness of the real Apega, and was said to be equal to Pandora, the first woman in Greek mythology.

Keitt (mango)

The 'Keitt' mango is a late-season mango cultivar which originated in south Florida.
History.
'Keitt' was reportedly a seedling of the Mulgoba cultivar that was planted on the property of Mrs. J.N. Keitt in Homestead, Florida
in 1939. However, recent genetic analysis suggests 'Keitt' was actually a seedling of Brooks, which would help explain its late-season ripening and large fruit size. The cultivar was selected and named in 1945, after which it quickly gained commercial nursery acceptance for its flavor, lack of fiber, and productivity. The fruit lacked color, however, and was much larger than most varieties, limiting it from becoming a widespread commercial staple. It did gain popularity among Florida home growers and remains one of the more widely planted trees in the state today.
'Keitt' trees are planted in the collections of the USDA's germplasm repository in Miami, Florida, the University of Florida's Tropical Research and Education Center in Homestead, and the Miami-Dade Fruit and Spice Park, also in Homestead.
Description.
The trees are a vigorous growers, but tends not to reach heights much over 20 feet. It has a low spreading habit that is not as compact as most other mango trees, and develops an open canopy. Fruit production is relatively heavy and consistent.
The fruit is comparatively large, some reaching up to several pounds in weight. They are of ovoid shape with a rounded apex lacking a beak. The skin color is typically green with some light red blush. The flesh is fiberless, tangy and sweet, with a monoembryonic seed. The fruit generally has good disease resistance, and typically ripens from August until September in Florida, often into October as well, making it one of the more valued late-season varieties.

The St. Lawrence Centre is a shopping mall in Massena, New York, United States. It includes a few stores, a post office, and an ice rink.
History.
The mall was built in 1990 by the Heritage Company. The cost of construction was $50 million. In 1995 it was sold to AP Massena Partners. During this, time the mall went through serious financial troubles, falling to just a 75% occupying rate. In September 2003, it was sold for $3.6 million to the Carlyle Development Group, who hired General Growth Properties to manage it beginning in February 2004.
Anchor stores include The Bon-Ton, J.C. Penney, and Sears. One anchor, originally occupied by Hills until 1998, Ames until 2002 and Steve & Barry's from 2007 to 2008, is vacant. Before Steve & Barry's opened, the town of Massena had attempted to use eminent domain to replace the Hills/Ames with a Wal-Mart in 2006. In 2009, the mall owners circulated a petition to replace the former Hills/Ames/Steve & Barry's building with a Target.
Several tenants moved out of the mall in 2011 and 2012, including original anchor store TJ Maxx.

The class incorporates two subclasses: the first four ships are referred to specifically as the first series of the "Lerici" class, while eight more ships produced to a slightly modified design are known as "second series "Lerici"s" or as the "Gaeta" class.
The class design has also been used as the basis for ships of the Royal Malaysian Navy (as the "Mahamiru" class), the Nigerian Navy, the United States Navy (as the "Osprey" class), the Royal Australian Navy (as the "Huon" class), and the Royal Thai Navy (as the "Lat Ya" class). Three updated vessels are under construction for the Finnish Navy (the "Katanpää" class). The Republic of Korea Navy operates an unlicensed derivative, known as the "Ganggyeong" class.
Design and service history.
Twelve ships were constructed by Intermarine SpA between 1985 and 1996. The first four, referred to as the "Lerici" subclass) were ordered on 7 January 1978. Six more ships of an improved design (known as the "Gaeta" subclass) were ordered on 30 April 1988, with two more "Gaeta"s ordered in 1991.
"Lerici" class.
The four "Lerici" class ships were launched from September 1982 through to April 1985, and were all commissioned into the Marina Militarie during 1985.
"Lerici" class ships have a displacement of 620 tons full load, long, wide, and a draught of . The ships have a maximum speed of , provided by a single diesel engine with a variable-pitch propellor. This speed is reduced to for mine-warfare operations; three active rudders (small propellors or waterjets mounted in a unit which can rotate through 360 degrees) are used to keep the minehunters on station. The ships have a range of at operational speed.
Each ship has a standard complement of 47, made up of 4 officers, 7 clearance divers, and 36 ratings. They are equipped with a hyperbaric chamber, "Pluto" remote-operated submersibles for mine investigation and clearance, and VDS FIAR SQQ-14 (IT) sonar. The ships are armed with a single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon.
The four ships, with their pennant numbers in brackets are:
"Lerici" and "Sapri" have been placed in reserve.
"Gaeta" class.
The eight ships of the Second Series "Lerici" class, more commonly known as the "Gaeta" class, were all launched in the early 1990s, and were commissioned by May 1996. The "Gaeta" class is almost identical to the "Lerici" class: the main structural differences between the ships are that displacement of the latter is 77 tons greater, the hull is longer, and the communications mast was moved from above the bridge to just forward of the exhaust funnel. The "Gaeta"s also used an improved version of the VDS FIAR SQQ-14 (IT) sonar, which was fitted in 1991 to the four "Lerici" class ships, and are armed with two Oerlikons instead of one.
Depending on the source, the "Gaeta" class ships are considered to be either a "Lerici" subclass, or a separate class of ships.
The eight ships, with their pennant numbers in brackets are:
Derivatives.
The "Lerici" class design has been successfully exported to Malaysia, Nigeria, the United States, and Australia. However, an inflexible export policy and demands by Intermarine that all ships be built in Italy are believed to have prevented wider sales. These restrictions were lessened in the leadup to the deals with the United States and Australia.
"Mahamiru" class.
The Royal Malaysian Navy operates four ships based on the "Lerici" class design: KDs "Mahamiru" (11), "Jerai" (12), "Ledang" (13), and "Kinabalu" (14). The four ships were ordered from Intermarine on 20 February 1981, commissioned into the Royal Malaysian Navy on 11 December 1985, and arrived in Malaysia on 26 March 1986. Referred to as "Malaysian "Lerici"s" or as "Mahamiru" class ships, two each are based in Lumut and Labuan.
"Mahamiru" class ships vary in design from the "Lerici" class. Most significant of these is that "Mahamiru"s are equipped with two diesel engines with dedicated propellor shafts instead of a single engine and propellor, giving them a maximum speed of and a minehunting speed of . The Malaysian ships are also equipped with Thomson Sintra TSM 2022 sonar, Thomson-CSF radar, and two PAP-104 remote-operated submersibles, and are longer than the Italian vessels they were based on. Instead of the 20 mm Oerlikon, the ships are armed with a single Bofors 40 mm L/70 gun. The standard crew complement is 42, 5 of whom are officers.
"Mahamiru" and "Ledang" were modernised by Thales as part of the Royal Malaysian Navy's Service Life Extension Program. The TSM 2022 sonars were upgraded to the Mark III version, and the ships were reconditioned to meet a minimum of ten more years active service.
Nigerian "Lerici".
In the late 1980s, the Nigerian Navy acquired two "Lerici" class ships. "Ohue" (M 371) was ordered in April 1983, laid down on 23 July 1984, launched on 22 November 1985, and commissioned on 28 May 1987. "Marabai" (M 372) was laid down on 11 March 1985, launched on 6 June 1986, and commissioned on 25 February 1988.
The Nigerian "Lerici"s are based on the "Mahamiru" class, but use the "Pluto" submersible, a Racal Decca 1226 radar, and are slightly slower with a maximum speed of . The Nigerian ships are armed with two 30 mm cannons, and have a crew complement of 50, including 5 officers.
Because of a lack of funding and maintenance, "Ohue" and "Marabai" were among several ships of the Nigerian Navy that were non-operational by 1996. However as at 2013, both of these vessels are currently undergoing refurbishment prior to rejoining the Nigerian Naval fleet.
"Osprey" class.
In August 1986, following the cancellation of a 17-strong mine warfare ship class after the prototype failed shock testing, the United States Navy placed an order for a mine warfare ship based on the "Lerici" class. In order to keep construction of the twelve ships, referred to as the "Osprey" class, under the control of Intermarine, the company established Intermarine USA by acquiring the Sayler Marine Corporation. Initially, the twelve ships were to be built by Intermarine USA in Savannah, Georgia, but in October 1989, construction for four ships was contracted out to Avondale Industries. The ships were launched between March 1991 and June 1997, and were commissioned between November 1993 and December 1998.
The "Osprey" class ships are larger than the other "Lerici" designs: they displace 918 tons fully loaded, are long, wide, and with a draught of . The ships are fitted with two diesel motors driving two Voith Schneider Propellers; these cycloidal propellers eliminate the need for the aft two active rudders. The ships use a Raytheon/Thomson Sintra SQQ-32 VDS sonar for minehunting, and Alliant SLQ-48 remote vehicles for mine disposal. The ships normally carry a crew of 51, including four officers, and are armed with two machine guns.
Upon entering service, the twelve ships were assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet, with the intention that they remain in service for approximately twelve months before being transferred to the United States Navy Reserve. However, all of the ships remained in service until decommissioning in 2006 and 2007. The class was replaced in service by the "Avenger" class mine countermeasures ships, and as of 2008, eight "Osprey"s had either been transferred to or marked for transfer to other navies: two each to the Hellenic Navy, Lithuanian Navy, Turkish Navy, and Republic of China (Taiwan) Navy.
"Huon" class.
In 1991, a force structure review saw the need to replace the "Bay" class inshore minehunters. The operating capabilities of the "Bay" class were found to be severely lacking, with four of the six ships cancelled before construction started. In 1994, a contract was awarded to Australian Defense Industries (ADI) to construct six minehunters based on the "Gaeta" subclass. The construction was to be a joint venture with Intermarine.
The hull of the first ship, was constructed by the Intermarine shipyard in Sarzana, Italy, then was sent to Australia in 1995 for fitting out at ADI's shipyard in Newcastle, New South Wales. ADI constructed the other five ships in the class, which were all named after Australian rivers.
The Australian ships, which are referred to as the "Huon" class, have a slightly greater displacement and draft than the "Gaeta"s. The ships use a GEC-Marconi Type 2093 sonar, two SUTEC Double Eagle remote mine disposal vehicles, and are armed with a 30 mm DC30B gun. The ships have a crew of 36 (including 6 officers), with further accommodation for 13 more, including 6 divers. The class entered service between 1998 and 2002 and is based at HMAS "Waterhen" in Sydney.
"Lat Ya" class.
Eight minehunters based on the "Gaeta" class were ordered by the Royal Thai Navy on 19 September 1996, after Intermarine won the tendering process initiated in April that year. Built at Intermarine's Sarzana shipyard, the first two ships of this class (HTM Ships "Lat Ya" and "Tha Din Daeng" were laid down in 1998 and launched in 1999. The other six ships were cancelled before they were laid down.
In comparison to the "Gaeta"s, "Lat Ya" class ships have a slightly greater displacement of 680 tons, with a corresponding increase in draught to . They use Atlas Elektronik radar and sonar, Pluto ROVs, and are fitted with a MSI cannon. Each ship carries 8 officers, and 42 other crew.
"Katanpää" class.
In 2004, the Finnish Navy began to look at replacements for the Kuha class minesweepers, which had been in service since 1974. On 23 November 2006, a contract was signed with Intermarine to build three mine countermeasures vessels (initially referred to as the MCMV 2010 class, then as the MITO class).
The MITOs are based on the "Huon" class design, but with a redesigned superstructure. The first two ships, laid down in 2008, are to be constructed at the Sarzana shipyard, while the third will be built at Sarzana, but transferred to Aker Finnyards in Rauma, Finland for fitting out. All three ships will be commissioned by 2012, and are expected to be in full service by 2015.
Unlicensed designs.
"Ganggyeong" class.
The six "Ganggyeong" ("Swallow") class ships of the Republic of Korea Navy are an unlicensed derivative of the "Lerici" class. Constructed by the Kangnam Shipbuilding Corporation, the class was commissioned into service between 1986 and 1994. The ships are smaller and less capable than the other "Lerici" designs.

Tlgadintsi

Tlgadintsi or Tlkatintsi ("Hovhannes Harutiunian", 1860, Tlkatin village, Kharpert, Western Armenia -1915) was an Armenian writer and teacher noted for his leading role in rural literature. He is credited with giving the first authoritative response to a call from Constantinople's Armenian intelligentsia, issued in the early 1890s, for writing firmly rooted in the village life of historic Western Armenia. His unique realist works range from probing the darkest corners of village life to revisiting cherished moments of childhood. Through his esteem as a mentor and his power as a writer he opened the way for a new generation of important writers such as Rupen Zartarian, Peniamin Noorigian, Vahé Haig, Vahan Totovents, Hamasdegh, and others. 
Early life and education.
He was born in 1860 in the village of Tlgadin (present-day Kuyulu) ten miles south of Kharpert. His father was a farmer who died when Tlgandintsi was quite young, leaving him and his mother in poverty. Despite their misfortune his mother persevered and enrolled him in the parish school to begin his education. On finishing the parish school he continued his education at the Smpadian School in Kharpert, where his courses included classical Armenian, grammar, geography, and mathematics.
Career and outlook.
By 1878 he had completed his studies at the Smpadian School and embarked on his dual career as village schoolmaster and journalist, this in the immediate aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 which had left the Armenian populace in widespread misery. He found his first teaching position in the village of Chunkoush (Çüngüş), and he established himself as a writer with the reports he sent to the Constantinople newspapers "Arevelk" and "Masis" through the 1880s. In 1893, responding to the call of Constantinople's Armenian literati, he emerged as a distinctive new voice in fiction with the publication in the newspaper "Hairenik" of "Emily", a satirical sketch about an American missionary and her activities in an Armenian village. This work, the first he signed with the name "Tlgadintsi", was welcomed by the critics and enthusiastically received by the readers.
Tlgadintsi spent his whole life in the immediate environs of Kharpert. His stories focus exclusively on the psychology, values and interpersonal relationships of completely ordinary villagers. In an era when thousands of his compatriots were abandoning their homeland for America, he stood staunchly opposed to the wave of emigration. He also took a dim view of the famed revolutionary parties of his day and was never affiliated with any of them. At the same time, he was seriously concerned with the inroads that missionary Protestantism was making among Armenians, an issue at the core of "Just One Glass". 
In 1884 Tlgadintsi was appointed director of his alma mater and left his teaching duties to settle in Kharpert. In 1887 he founded the Central National School in Kharpert and in 1888 became its director, a post which he held continuously, with one exception below, until his death in 1915 . The school stood in Kharpert's Upper Quarter next to St. Hagop church and was commonly known as the Central School or "Red College" because its exterior was painted red. It was also simply designated with Tlgadintsi's name. Its advanced level included courses in Armenian secular and church history, classical and modern Armenian, grammar and composition, English, English literature, French, French literature, Turkish and Turkish composition, mathematics, music, and physics.
In 1895, at the height of the Hamidian massacres, the school was attacked by an anti-Armenian mob and totally burned to the ground. With the return of normalcy, Tlgadintsi and some colleagues managed to open a few classes in a building in the Lower Quarter of Kharpert, while work to rebuild the Central School at its original site was undertaken with the financial help of Kharpert educational associations in the United States. The move back to the original location took place in 1900. The rebuilt school continued to be called the "Red College" even though it was no longer painted red. 
In 1903, in the course of a crackdown on Armenian militants, Tlgadintsi was arrested and thrown in jail for nine months as a supposed subversive, along with his leading disciple, Rupen Zartarian. Upon his release he was allowed to resume his post as director of the Central School.
Last moments.
When Turkish forces arrived in Kharpert in 1915 to destroy its Armenian community, Tlgadintsi found temporary hiding in the house of a childhood Muslim friend of his to whom he entrusted his large collection of unpublished works for safekeeping. Quite notably, the collection included his accounts of the infamous massacres of 1895. One day he was completely devastated to learn that in a moment of panic his friend had set fire to the entire collection and reduced it to ash. Shortly afterward, he was found out and thrown into a jail crowded with other Armenian notables. At this point he learned that his wife, six daughters, and son had already been sent to their deaths on the deportation routes. Nevertheless, under those grim circumstances he still managed to show a few flashes of his characteristic wit to lift the spirits of his fellow prisoners. 
On June 20th 1915, he was murdered in a gorge near his birthplace in the course of the Armenian Genocide.

Oakley Hall III

Oakley "Tad" Hall III (May 26, 1950 – February 13, 2011) was an American playwright, director, and author. The eldest child of novelist Oakley Hall and photographer Barbara E. Hall, Oakley attended University of California Irvine and Boston University. By age 28, he was a rising star in the New York theatre scene. In the mid-1970s, his play "Mike Fink" was optioned by Joseph Papp of the Public Theater. Oakley founded and was the artistic director of the Lexington Conservatory Theatre in upstate New York, where his plays "Grinder's Stand" and "Beatrice (Cenci) and the Old Man", and his stage adaptation of "Frankenstein", enjoyed their première productions.
In 1978, Hall suffered massive head injuries in a fall from a bridge. He eventually returned to California to live in Nevada City near his family; there his play "Grinder's Stand", which he had been writing at the time of his accident, was produced by The Foothill Theatre Company, directed by Philip Sneed. The story of this production, entwined with Oakley's fall and the slow process of creating a new life, are movingly told in Bill Rose's award-winning documentary, "The Loss of Nameless Things".
Oakley made a lifelong study of the pre-surrealist playwright Alfred Jarry, and over the years translated several of Jarry's plays from the original French. In 2008, Hall moved to Albany, New York to live with Hadiya Wilborn, who fostered a collaboration with acclaimed puppeteer Ed Atkeson. This resulted in a production of one of Jarry's translated plays, Ubu Rex, performed by the Firlefanz Puppets at Steamer No. 10 Theatre in Albany, New York, directed by Oakley, with Steven Patterson in the title role. In the fall of 2010, Moving Finger Press published Oakley's novel, "Jarry and Me," in which Oakley intertwines a memoir of his own life with a sly "autobiography" of Jarry. One of the last sentences of the book is, "Jarry dies with a grin on his face." 
On February 13, 2011, Hall died of a heart attack at his Albany home. He is survived by his two children, Oakley and Elizabeth.
Some of Hall's writings are available online at www.absintheurpress.com, in a collection which is continually being supplemented.
The Highlander Theater Company of Chase Collegiate School in Waterbury, CT performed Oakley Hall III's Frankenstein in March 2012. This was the first production of this play in three decades. http://www.chasecollegiate.org/page.cfm?p=136

As was the case for the 2009 SuperLiga, the top four overall finishers in MLS in 2009 that hadn't already qualified for the Champions League qualified for SuperLiga. This year's competition was contested by the Houston Dynamo, the Chicago Fire, Chivas USA, and the New England Revolution from MLS. The four Mexican teams were Pachuca, Morelia, Puebla, and UNAM.
New England, Houston, Morelia and Puebla advanced from their groups, with the Revolution beating Puebla on penalties in one semifinal, and Morelia defeating Houston in the other. Morelia defeated New England 2–1 in the final at Gillette Stadium on September 1.
Domestic competitions.
Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.
The top six overall teams from the 2009 MLS season (Columbus, Los Angeles, Houston, Seattle, Chicago, and Chivas USA) received automatic berths into the Third round of the 2010 U.S. Open Cup, while the eight remaining U.S.-based MLS teams and the expansion Philadelphia Union competed in a single-elimination qualification tournament to determine the MLS's final two official entrants into the competition. Teams were seeded one through nine, with the seventh-place MLS team from 2009 earning the first seed (and would play the winner of the eight v. nine play-in game), while each following team would receive its respective seed. The New York Red Bulls and D.C. United earned the final two MLS spots in the Third round.
For the first time since 2006, the semifinals were contested exclusively by MLS teams, with Seattle beating Chivas USA and Columbus defeating DC United. The final was played October 5 at Qwest Field in Seattle with the defending cup holders, the Sounders, defeating the Crew 2–1. The Sounders became the first MLS team ever to successfully defend the U.S. Open Cup, and the first team from any league to do so since New York Pancyprian-Freedoms in 1983.
Canadian championship.
Toronto FC, as a Canadian-based MLS team, is not eligible to compete in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, and instead contested the Canadian Championship with the two Canadian-based teams in the Division-2 Pro League, Vancouver Whitecaps and Montreal Impact. Toronto FC won the tournament, claiming the Voyageurs Cup and Canada's entry into the Preliminary Round of the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League.

Bumpnose trevally

The bumpnose trevally, "Carangoides hedlandensis" (also known as the bumpnose kingfish and onion kingfish) is a species of relatively small inshore marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The bumpnose trevally is fairly common in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-west Pacific region, ranging from South Africa in the west to Japan and Samoa in the east. It is a small species by carangid standards, reaching a maximum known length of 32 cm, and can be distinguished from the similarly shaped "Carangoides armatus" by a distinct 'bump' on the snout, which gives the fish its common name. The species inhabits coastal waters, often living along bays and beaches where it takes shrimps, small crabs and juvenile fish as prey. The bumpnose trevally is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line, trawls and seine nets. It is also of minor importance to anglers, taken by baits from beaches and piers, and is considered a modest table fish.
Taxonomy and naming.
The bumpnose trevally is classified within the genus "Carangoides", a group of fish commonly called jacks and trevallies. "Carangoides" falls into the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, itself part the order Perciformes, in the suborder Percoidei.
The species, as it is currently accepted, was first described and classified by the Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley in 1934 based upon a sample taken from Port Hedland in Western Australia, which was designated to be the holotype. Whitley named the species "Olistus hedlandensis", placing the fish in what was at the time a valid genus of jacks. When "Olistus" was synonymised with "Carangoides", the fish was placed either in "Caranx" or "Carangoides", and is currently accepted as belonging in the latter. The specific epithet refers to the type location of the species, Port Hedland. This was not the first time the fish had been described though, with Georges Cuvier applying the name "Olistus malabaricus" to the species in 1833, which would give it priority over Whitley's name. However, when "Olistus" was merged into "Carangoides", a taxonomic homonym was created with "Carangoides malabaricus" and thus Whitley's name has been accepted to overcome this problem. The bumpnose trevally is very similar to "Carangoides armatus", and appears to have been misidentified as such many times, with 1980 review of the two species finding many misidentified fish in museum collections.
Description.
The bumpnose trevally is one of the smaller members of the genus "Carangoides", growing to a known maximum of 32 cm in length. It is quite similar in appearance to a number of co-occurring trevallies, especially "Carangoides armatus" and "Atropus atropos", with the simplest identifying feature being the distinct break in the contour ('bump') of the interorbital region, which becomes more pronounced with increasing size. The body is compressed and deep, with the head profile very steep in adults, leading to a more dorsal profile in comparison to the ventral profile. The dorsal fin is in two sections, the first consisting of 8 spines while the second has 1 spine and between 20 and 22 soft rays. The anal fin has two anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 16 to 18 soft rays, while the pelvic fin has 1 spine and 18 soft rays. The lobes of the second dorsal and anal fins are elongate and filamentous, being longer than the head. In males, a number of the central soft rays are also produced into filaments of varying lengths. The lateral line has a moderate anterior arch, which contains 63 to 70 scales, while the straight section has 8 to 14 scales and 21 to 27 scutes. The curved and straight sections intersect below the tenth to twelfth soft rays of the second dorsal fin. The breast is devoid of scales, with the scaleless area extending to the origin of the pelvic fins and up to the base of the pectoral fins. Both jaws have bands of villiform teeth, which are widest anteriorly. There are a total of 20 to 27 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae.
The body of the bumpnose trevally is a silvery green-blue above, becoming more silvery white below, with a dark blotch present on the operculum. The spinous dorsal fin and the soft dorsal fin rays are black, while the anal fin is brownish, with the filaments and lobe often blackish. The caudal fin has black trailing and leading edges, and the pelvic fin is dusky to black. Juveniles often have 5 to 7 vertical crossbars on their sides.
Distribution and habitat.
The bumpnose trevally is widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Indian and west Pacific Oceans. In the Indian Ocean, the species ranges from South Africa, Madagascar and the Seychelles north along east Africa to Mozambique, but has no records further north until India and Sri Lanka. Its distribution extends into South East Asia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and northern Australia, with the species extending as far north as Japan and as far east as Samoa in the Pacific.
The bumpnose trevally is an inshore fish, rarely venturing to depths greater than 50 m. It inhabits sandy bays and beaches, and appears to be quite tolerant of turbid waters, often living in the dirty waters near river mouths. Despite this, it appears to have a fairly low tolerance to reduced salinities and is not found in estuaries themselves. 
Biology and fishery.
The bumpnose trevally is usually founds in small groups of two or more, swimming along beaches where they take prey which consists of shrimps, small crabs and fish. Studies on the North West Shelf of Australia have found the species often aggregates with other carangids, particularly "Carangoides humerosus", "Ulua aurochs" and "Selaroides leptolepis", and together these make up a large proportion of the resident fish fauna. Reproduction in the species is very poorly known, with young fish often showing up in South Africa during summer.
The bumpnose trevally is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range, caught using hook and line, bottom trawls, beach seines and various fish traps. In some areas, such as Fiji, it is of more importance, but there are no catch statistics available for the species. It is also of minor importance to anglers, often taken from beaches and piers using baits, and is considered marginal table fare.

Vote for Change? 2004

Vote for Change? 2004 is a 2008 documentary film produced and directed by Rick Charnoski and Coan Nichols. It follows the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam on the 2004 Vote for Change tour.
Plot.
The film follows Pearl Jam on the 2004 Vote for Change tour, a politically motivated American popular music concert tour that took place in October 2004. The live performance footage of Pearl Jam is intercut with interviews with the members of the band, its fans, and people on the street about voting and politics. The film's timespan runs from just prior to the start of the tour to Election Day 2004.
Production.
In April 2004, independent filmmakers Rick Charnoski and Coan Nichols met Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament. Ament had been a fan of the filmmakers' skateboarding films ("Fruit of the Vine", "Northwest", "Tent City", etc.). He asked them if they would be interested in working with Pearl Jam, and mentioned that the band would be going out on the Vote for Change tour prior to the 2004 presidential election.
The filmmakers began shooting in October 2004 in Seattle, Washington at Pearl Jam's rehearsal sessions. They traveled with Pearl Jam through Reading, Pennsylvania, Toledo, Ohio, Grand Rapids, Michigan, St. Louis, Missouri, Asheville, North Carolina and Kissimmee, Florida. The film was shot entirely in Super-8. The soundtrack was recorded and mixed by Pearl Jam's sound engineer, Brett Eliason.
Release.
After the tour, Charnoski and Nichols edited the film, but held off on releasing it due to the outcome of the 2004 election. Charnoski and Nichols said that they decided to release the film before the 2008 presidential election to "remind people why it is so important to vote." The film was released digitally and for free through Pearl Jam's official website in the days prior to Election Day 2008. Pearl Jam's official website offered a contest for Pearl Jam fans to host their own movie premieres on November 3, 2008. Among the prizes for the 50 winners were DVDs of the film.

Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) is an executive department of the government of Florida.
The Commissioner of Agriculture (directly elected by voters statewide for a four-year term, and a member of the Florida Cabinet) is the head of the department. The current commissioner is Adam Putnam.
History.
The Florida Constitution of 1868 provided for the creation of the Office of Commissioner of Immigration, whose duties consisted of attracting settlers to engage in agriculture. The Florida Constitution was amended in 1871 to consolidate the offices of Surveyor General and Commissioner of Immigration as the new Commissioner of Lands and Immigration. In 1885, the Constitution was revised and the Commissioner of Lands and Immigration post was renamed Commissioner of Agriculture. The duties of the Commissioner of Agriculture were revised to include supervision of the state prisons. (A Division of Corrections was created in 1957 and state prisons were removed from the list of Commissioner of Agriculture responsibilities). 
The Agricultural Services Reorganization Act (ASRA) was passed in 1959 and became effective January 15, 1961. This state law abolished some independent boards and bureaus, which were assigned to the Department of Agriculture's divisions. These included: Administration, Animal Industry, Dairy Industry, Fruit and Vegetable Inspection, Marketing, Plant Industry, Inspection and Standards. The State Chemist, a position that existed since 1891, was moved to the new Division of Chemistry.
The Legislature created the Office of Consumer Services in 1967. The Executive Reorganization Act of 1969 renamed the Office of Consumer Services the Division of Consumer Services and the Board of Forestry the Division of Forestry. The Department of Agriculture was renamed the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS).
The 1992 Legislature passed Chapter 92-291 of the Laws of Florida, which formally organized the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services into the following divisions: Administration, Agricultural Environmental Services (AES), Animal Industry, Plant Industry, Marketing and Development, Dairy Industry, Food Safety, Fruit and Vegetables, Consumer Services, Forestry, Standards, Aquaculture, and Licensing.
In addition to the above divisions, the FDACS includes separate offices for Agricultural Law Enforcement, Agricultural Water Policy, Agricultural Emergency Preparedness, the Inspector General, as well as for the Commissioner of Agriculture.
Organization.
The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is headed by the Commissioner, who is elected statewide to a four-year term. The Commissioner is assisted in managing the Department by a Chief of Staff, three Deputy Commissioners and one Assistant Deputy Commissioner. The Department is organizated into twelve programatic Divisions and one support Division, each headed by a Division Director. Each Division is subdivided into Bureaus, with each headed by a Bureau Chief. The Bureaus are further subdivided into Sections.

<doc id="19929636" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19929636" title="Golgi tendon reflex">
Golgi tendon reflex

The Golgi tendon reflex is a normal component of the reflex arc of the peripheral nervous system. In a Golgi tendon reflex, skeletal muscle contraction causes the agonist muscle to simultaneously lengthen and relax. This reflex is also called the inverse myotatic reflex, because it is the inverse of the stretch reflex. Though muscle tension is increasing during the contraction, alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord supplying the muscle are inhibited. However, antagonistic muscles are activated.
Function.
The Golgi tendon reflex operates as a protective feedback mechanism to control the tension of an active muscle by causing relaxation before the tendon tension becomes high enough to cause damage. First, as a load is placed on the muscle, the afferent neuron from the Golgi tendon organ fires into the central nervous system. Second, the motor neuron from the spinal cord is inhibited via an IPSP and muscle relaxes.
Contrast to stretch reflex.
The stretch reflex operates as a feedback mechanism to control muscle length by causing muscle contraction. In contrast, the tendon reflex operates as a feedback mechanism to control muscle tension by causing muscle relaxation before muscle force becomes so great that tendons might be torn. Although the tendon reflex is less sensitive than the stretch reflex, it can override the stretch reflex when tension is great, making you drop a very heavy weight, for example. Like the stretch reflex, the tendon reflex is ipsilateral. The sensory receptors for this reflex are called tendon Golgi receptors, which lie within a tendon near its junction with a muscle. In contrast to muscle spindles, which are sensitive to changes in muscle length, tendon organs detect and respond to changes in muscle tension that are caused by muscular contraction, but not passive stretch.
Steps.
A tendon reflex operates as follows:
Pathology.
The clasp-knife response is a stretch reflex with a rapid decrease in resistance when attempting to flex a joint. However, it is actually thought to be caused by the tendon reflex of the antagonistic muscle of that joint, which gets extended. It is one of the characteristic responses of an upper motor neuron lesion.

Sue Barton

Sue Barton is the central character in a series of seven novels for adolescent girls written by Helen Dore Boylston between 1936 and 1952. The series was published by Little, Brown & Co. and saw a number of reprints following its initial publication. At present the series is in reprint by Image Cascade Publishing.
The series follows Sue Barton through her nurse's training and her work life. In "Sue Barton: Student Nurse", Sue begins training as a student nurse. She meets her friends Kit and Connie in this book and also her husband-to-be, Dr Bill Barry. Sue manages to have a number of adventures as she trains, including falling down a laundry shaft and saving a feverish patient from jumping out of a window while recovering from appendix surgery. In "Sue Barton: Senior Nurse", Sue finishes her training, which includes psychiatric nursing and obstetrics. She also becomes engaged to Bill at the end of this book. In publisher's note in a 1967 British edition of the book, Boylston stated that all the nursing incidents in the first two books were based on real events.  The Kit, Connie and Bill characters were also based on real individuals and used their real names, while others used pseudonyms.  She denied that Barton herself was an autobiographical portrait, saying "I made her up, lock, stock and barrel. She is the kind of person and the kind of nurse I wished I were, and I had a lot of fun creating her."
"Sue Barton: Visiting Nurse" follows Sue and her friend Kit as they venture to New York City to join the Henry Street Settlement Nurses, created by Lillian Wald. Connie gets married in this book and Bill pressures Sue to marry him. Sue refuses, wanting a chance to repay the training she received from the Settlement Houses. At one point, Sue helps an elderly patient fulfill her dream of travel by using the money for her wedding clothes.
"Sue Barton: Rural Nurse" follows Sue as she ultimately leaves the Visiting Nurses and returns home, only to find that a tragic accident has left Bill with the care of a disabled brother. He cannot marry Sue until things are settled. Sue sets herself up as a visiting rural nurse in the town of Springfield, New Hampshire and winds up in the middle of a typhoid outbreak. Sue finally marries Bill at the start of "Sue Barton: Superintendent Nurse" and then works as the head of the nursing school at the new hospital in Springfield. However, her marriage to Bill is not plain sailing and Sue questions her ability to provide a proper nursing training for her students. In "Sue Barton: Neighborhood Nurse" Sue suffers regrets about leaving her nursing career while she cares for her three children, each of whom has particular needs. She also helps a young teenager, Cal, to be more sociable and Cal's mother, the artist Mona Stuart, to be kinder. Sue realises that her role in her family and the wider neighborhood is also important. In "Sue Barton: Staff Nurse" (the final installment in the series), Sue returns to work to support her four children while her husband is in a sanatorium suffering from tuberculosis. He eventually recovers and the family is reunited once more, with the implication that Sue will return to her position as wife and mother.

Florida Department of Law Enforcement

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) is a Florida government agency. The department formally coordinates eight boards, councils, and commissions. FDLE's duties, responsibilities and procedures are mandated through Chapter 943, Florida Statutes, and Chapter 11, Florida Administrative Code.
FDLE is headed by a commissioner (executive director) who reports to Florida Cabinet which is composed of the Governor, the Attorney General, the Chief Financial Officer and the Commissioner of Agriculture. The Commissioner is appointed to his position by the Governor and Cabinet and confirmed by the Florida Senate. 
The department is headquartered in Tallahassee, the state capital, and has close to 2,000 employees statewide. The department maintains seven regional operations centers, 15 field offices and seven crime laboratories.
Overview.
FDLE's "four fundamental values" are "service, integrity, respect, and quality."
FDLE's five "program areas" are:
FDLE is one of the few state law enforcement agencies in the United States to have earned triple accreditation. FDLE is accredited by the following organizations:
History.
In 1967, the Florida Legislature merged the duties and responsibilities of several state criminal justice organizations to create the Bureau of Law Enforcement. Bringing together the resources of the Florida Sheriffs Bureau, the State Narcotics Bureau, and the law enforcement activities of the Anti-Bookie Squad of the Attorney General's Office, the original Bureau of Law Enforcement had 94 positions and a $1.5 million budget for its first year of operation. The bureau was headed by a commissioner who reported to a board composed of the Governor of Florida, specified members of the Cabinet, two sheriffs, and one chief of police. The agency had five divisions: Administration, Intelligence and Investigation, Technical Services, Administrative Intelligence, and Planning and Research.
As a result of Florida governmental restructuring in July 1969, the bureau became the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, or FDLE. As a department of the executive branch of government, FDLE was headed by the Governor and Cabinet. The FDLE commissioner was appointed by the Governor with the approval of three members of the Cabinet and subject to confirmation by the Florida Senate. At the time, the department consisted of four divisions – Operations, Administrative Intelligence, Criminal Identification and Information, and Training and Inspection.
The agency permanently decentralized many services offered previously only through Headquarters, and rolling them out to the newly defined ROCs. They assumed responsibility for human resource and business functions and began to offer information systems support, training, and increased analytical assistance directly to the surrounding region. The restructuring placed authority at the regional level, with members of the ROCs reporting to a regional director (special agent in charge) instead of the Tallahassee headquarters. The traditional investigative role of the ROCs expanded significantly, allowing them to offer more specialized assistance.
In July 1990, FDLE was the first state law enforcement agency in the nation to be accredited by CALEA. The agency successfully attained CALEA reaccreditation status in 1995, 2000, 2003 and 2006. In October 1996, FDLE was the first statewide law enforcement agency to be accredited by CFA. The agency was jointly reaccredited in 2000, 2003 and 2006 by both CALEA and CFA. FDLE also received initial accreditation by ASCLD/LAB in 1990 and has achieved reaccreditation during each subsequent five-year reaccreditation period.
In the late 1990s, FDLE's Executive Policy Board was formally organized. Composed of program directors, regional special agents in charge, and other headquarters leadership, the EPB provides a frequent forum for the review of department-wide issues and policy-level decision making.
In 2000, the Legislature transferred the Division of Public Assistance Fraud from the Auditor General to FDLE. The following year, the Department of Community Affairs' Office of Criminal Justice Grants was legislatively transferred to FDLE. Following the events of September 11, 2001, FDLE assumed responsibility as the state's domestic security coordinator and partnering with Florida Sheriffs to lead the state's seven Regional Domestic Security Task Forces. The Florida Capitol Police, with its responsibility for providing law enforcement and security services to the state Capitol, was legislatively transferred to FDLE in 2002.

If We Dream Too Long

If We Dream Too Long is a novel written by Singaporean writer Goh Poh Seng. This debut novel was completed in 1968 though it was first published in 1972 by Singapore's Island Press, a press formed by Goh to self-publish his first novel. The book won the National Book Development Council of Singapore's Fiction Book Award in 1976. It is often hailed as the first true Singaporean novel.
Plot summary.
The book follows the life of Kwang Meng, a young 18-year-old who has just graduated from secondary school. He currently works as a clerk, a job which he hates and finds monotonous. Two of his secondary school friends, Hock Lai and Nadarajah (the latter nicknamed Portia), follow different career paths in their diverging lives. Hock Lai becomes a white-collared worker, determined to climb the corporate ladder, while Portia intends to further his studies in the UK. Kwang Meng meets and strikes up a relationship with a local bar girl, Lucy, at Paradise Bar. Unfortunately, owing to their very different social backgrounds, the couple break up (initiated by Lucy).
Hock Lai tries to matchmake Kwang Meng with one of his female acquaintances Anne. Kwang Meng meets Boon Teik and Mei-I, neighbours who are both teachers, and whom Kwang Meng finds an ideal couple. Hock Lai himself gets married with Cecilia, whose father is one of the richest tycoons of Singapore. Throughout all this, Kwang Meng comes across as a rather passive figure, preferring merely to observe and seek solace through activities like swimming in the sea, smoking and drinking in bars. At the novel's end, Kwang Meng's father suffers a stroke, which destined him to take up the burden of supporting his family.
Reception.
"If We Dream Too Long" encountered a lukewarm reception on its publication in 1972. In Goh's own words, "the local press was unenthusiastic and the university was not supportive". "The Straits Times"'s reviewer Cheah Boon Kheng complained that "the style is loose and inelegant, the prose putrid and flat, the jokes puerile and the dialogue chitty chitty bang bang." Elsewhere "Dream" received a more cordial reception – it was translated into Russian in 1975 and into Tagalog thereafter. In time it came to be appreciated by academics and younger readers who responded enthusiastically when Goh revisited Singapore to discuss the novel.

Beth Nolan

Beth Nolan (born August 21, 1951 in New York City) is a vice president and general counsel of 
the George Washington University. She was Bill Clinton's final White House Counsel. She served in other White House and United States Department of Justice positions, taught law, and was in private practice.
Personal.
Nolan was born in New York City, and educated at Scripps College (B.A., 1973) and Georgetown University Law Center (J.D., magna cum laude, 1980). She was Editor in Chief of the Georgetown Law Journal. She was admitted to the bar of the District of Columbia in 1981.
Other.
She testified on March 5, 2001 before the House Government Reform Committee that Bill Clinton's pardon of 
Marc Rich did not advance President Clinton's financial interests, but that she had personally opposed it.
President Clinton nominated her in 1997 to be Assistant Attorney General of the United States for the Office of Legal Counsel, but the United States Senate did not confirm her. Along with 
Webster Hubbell and Vince Foster, she had helped Ira Magaziner prepare an affidavit explaining why he 
was not required to reveal who had participated in the formulation of the failed 1993 Clinton health care plan. 
United States District Court judge Royce Lamberth called the affidavit a lie, although an appellate court 
held Magaziner had acted in good faith - after her nomination had failed.
Her appointment on August 10, 1999 as White House Counsel did not require Senate confirmation, and she began in September.
During its investigations of the 1996 United States campaign finance controversy, Monica Lewinsky scandal, White House FBI files controversy, and White House travel office controversy the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform subpoenaed White House email traffic. In March 2000 White House contractors testified that the email previously produced in response to these subpoenas had omitted probably thousands of responsive emails. Technical employees had discovered in June 1998 that the automated records management system had incorrectly scanned and logged the emails, possibly since 1994. The testified further that White House staff had cautioned them against disclosing this problem to anyone, on pain of dismissal or even prosecution. White House Counsel Nolan testified (March 2000) before the committee and a skeptical chairman Dan Burton that it would take Northrop Grumman contract personal 6 months to restore the data. She also said that to the best of her knowledge she knew of no evidence that anyone in the White House had attempted to conceal this noncompliance, nor that she or her office had been told of allegations of threats.
After working in the White House, Nolan became a partner with the law firm Crowell & Moring in the firm's white collar and securities litigation group. She had a broad-based federal and international practice focuses on strategic counseling, congressional investigations, internal investigations and compliance, government and legal ethics, federal election law, constitutional and public policy issues, international claims, and other matters.
In February 2006 she published a letter to members of the United States Congress, signed jointly with several legal scholars former government officials arguing that an NSA electronic surveillance program was unlawful.
Nolan argued in March 2007 that the Bush administration's assertions of executive privilege were excessive in the matter of the Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, both in a "Washington Post" op-ed piece and before Linda Sánchez and the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law during their Hearing on “Ensuring 
Executive Branch Accountability”. She said the administration might lose such a claim. At the GWU law school she had taught constitutional law.
In 2007 she represented, along with a great many others, Blackwater Worldwide a private military company. 
Following the Blackwater Baghdad shootings, Henry Waxman's House Oversight Committee subpoenaed its Chief Executive Officer Erik Prince to testify. The climate of opinion among politicians and the public at large jeopardized its contracts to 
provide security for State Department personnel in Iraq.
During the 2008 presidential election she contributed the maximum allowed to the Hillary Clinton campaign. She has also been a contributor to Wesley Clark, Emily's List and John Kerry.

X-Infernus

X-Infernus is a four-issue comic book mini-series that started December 2008. Written by C. B. Cebulski, with art by Giuseppe Camuncoli, it was a sequel to Inferno. It sees the return of the character Magik searching Limbo for her soul.
Plot summary.
Chapter One: Soul Survivors.
Colossus is wondering why the X-Men are doing nothing to save Illyana from Limbo. Scott says they've tried and will keep trying but Limbo is still currently sealed off. Amanda Sefton has been unable to break the seal, Doctor Strange is nowhere to be found and Warren has scientists looking into it, but this is magic and there is nothing more they can do. Colossus says he doesn't accept it.
While in Limbo, Magik attacks various other demons looking for her Soulsword and the original Bloodstone amulet. This does not go unnoticed by Mephisto, Blackheart, Satannish, Dormammu and Hela. Belasco's daughter, Witchfire appears during the meeting and reveals she is now the current owner of the original amulet and vows to take her father's place as ruler of Limbo and kill Magik. 
Back at the X-Men's base in San Francisco, Mercury and Rockslide are watching Kurt and Pixie train. Kurt brings up her Soul Dagger in conversation, which Megan is not pleased to hear. Kurt points out that people have noticed that when she uses it, her personality changes. Pixie begins to cry and summons her Soul Dagger; her personality changes and she stabs Kurt in the chest, knocking him out. Mercury and Rockslide, who are watching the session, rush in and pull her away from Kurt. Beast enters and is shocked at what he finds. Pixie's Soul Dagger is stuck in Kurt's chest and when she removes it, she accidentally discovers where Magik's Soulsword is hidden, inside Nightcrawler. Sensing the Soulsword, Magik teleports into the X-Men's base to reclaim it.
Chapter Two: This Mortal Coil.
Magik stands before Pixie, Mercury, Rockslide and Beast, demanding Pixie hand over her Soulsword. She takes out Mercury, Rockslide and Beast, and engages Pixie in combat. Pixie refuses to hand over the sword, but Magik overpowers her and regains her sword. As soon as she gets a hold of it, her appearance changes and she becomes more human than demon. At that moment, Colossus, Armor, Karma, Wolverine, Cyclops, and Emma Frost enter. Magik strikes Colossus when he calls her 'Snowflake' but senses something is wrong when she doesn't feel anything. She teleports back to Limbo, telling her brother he can't save her; she has to save herself. The X-Men gather the wounded and Pixie attempts to go after Magik but Kurt stops her. Pixie breaks into tears and apologizes for stabbing him.
In Limbo, Witchfire learns that Magik has left Limbo and assumes control. She stabs S'ym through the chest, seriously wounding him. Magik teleports in to find him chained to the throne. She asks what happened and he informs her that Belasco's daughter, Witchfire, has taken control in her absence. Illyana is shocked to hear Belasco had a daughter, and Witchfire steps out of the shadows and attacks Magik.
Peter says he is going after Illyana. The other X-Men have a way to get to Limbo (through Pixie). Scott agrees with him and puts together a team consisting of Colossus, Pixie, Wolverine, Mercury and Rockslide, with Kurt in charge due to Pixie and Pete's personal stake in the mission. Pixie then teleports them into Limbo only to find they are surrounded by many hostile demons.
Chapter Three: What You Wish For.
Magik confronts Witchfire at her castle. Witchfire claims everything Belasco ever owned, including Magik's soul, and after a quick battle, Magik is taken down by Witchfire, who claims the second Bloodstone amulet. Witchfire stabs Magik through the chest, injuring her and knocking her out. Witchfire takes Pixie's Bloodstone and adds it to the original amulet, giving her four Bloodstones and a more demonic appearance.
Elsewhere in Limbo, Kurt, Mercury, Colossus, Rockslide, Pixie and Wolverine are fighting their way through many demons. Pixie, Mercury, and Rockslide are horrified at how brutal the older X-Men are towards the demons. An octopus-type creature attacks Kurt until Pixie jumps in and kills it with her soul dagger. Colossus shatters Rockslide, who reforms from Limbo rock, and Wolverine gets stabbed through the chest with a sword that sends him into a berserker rage where he kills all the demons that stand in their way. After Colossus removes the sword from Wolverine, they stumble upon Belasco's castle. After trying to decide how to get there, Pixie senses the darkness within her suddenly growing and she teleports off to the castle by herself.
After arriving in the castle, Pixie happens upon a mirror that shows herself transformed into a demon. Pixie freaks out and runs into the throne room where she finds Magik chained up and Witchfire. Witchfire grabs Pixie by the throat and forces her to become her new apprentice and begins forging a new Bloodstone from Pixie's soul.
Hearing the screams from the castle, Kurt teleports the X-Men into the throne room. Once there, Witchfire turns Colossus and Wolverine against Mercury and Rockslide. Kurt notices Illyana chained to a pillar, and she asks him to stab her with the Pixie's soul dagger, as it is the only way to free her and he is the only one to do it because he is attuned to magic. She apologizes and he stabs her. At that moment, Colossus punches Kurt and Witchfire finished making her fifth and final Bloodstone from a partially demonic Pixie.
Chapter Four: Soul's End.
Kurt, discovering that Colossus' punch is far from lethal, slips past him and Wolverine to remove the Soul Dagger from Illyana, retrieving her Soulsword and using them both to free his teammates from their enchantment. He then sees Witchfire finish making the fifth Bloodstone out of Pixie's soul and slices off Witchfire's hand. But she brushes him away with a magic blast and re-grows a demonic 3-fingered hand while Kurt consoles Pixie and tells her to use the dagger to free Illyana because of their mutual connection. Witchfire uses the Bloodstones to summon the Elder Gods to her aid, but Illyana and her friends interrupt her summoning. While the X-Men battle the Elder Gods, Illyana fights Witchfire, who blasts her. But Illyana is sheathed inside Mercury's magic-resistant skin, and they slash Witchfire and strip her of the amulet containing the Bloodstones. Illyana and Pixie use their blades to smash the amulet, but Witchfire escapes the crumbling castle with four Bloodstones into the Elder Gods' dimension. Pixie is despondent over losing more of her soul and tries to attack Magik with her Soul Dagger, but the glowing stone in its blade indicates that the stolen piece of her soul is inside it. Pixie flies away in tears.
Illyana is upset that she hadn't recovered her soul and fears for her humanity. Kurt consoles her by telling her of his half-demonic parentage and how he has decided he has a soul regardless of that. Peter also tries to console his sister, but when he sees the horns still on her head, she fearfully teleports all of them back to the X-Men's compound and then tries to leave. Peter, her old friends from the New Mutants, and Cyclops finally convince her to stay.

The film directed by Bappaditya Bandopadhyay stars Ram Kapur, Suman Ranganathan, Arvin Tucker and Perizaad Zorabian.The film was premiered at the Osian Cinefan Asian Film Festival in July 2005. Since then it has traveled to 11 International Film Festival amidst much critical accolades and has been touted as a 'must watch for every woman'. Nominated for the best feature film at Sao Paulo International Film Festival, Brazil, Ashville International Film Festival,NC, Global Knight International Film Festival, Malta, and Golden Gate International Film Festival,SF, it won the award in Asheville. Officially released in 6 January 2006, this small film has been doing the rounds in the video stores for some time.
The plot is derived from a real life incident where a tribal woman named Devakibai was sold in an open auction in Pandhana, a sub-division of Khandwa district in Madhya Pradesh, in January 2003. The auction was organized by the Maha Panchayat Panchaganga and legitimized by the presence of Hiralal Silawat, Minister of Fisheries, who inaugurated the function. This atrocity was uncovered by journalist Deepak Tiwari and became the cover story of the magazine, The Week.
Plot.
The film Devaki takes a look at the parallel lives of two young women, belonging to strikingly different backgrounds, who were both betrayed by their fathers and lovers.
Devaki (Suman Ranganathan) is a village girl who is forced into marriage to a 70-year-old man. On the night of the marriage, she is raped by the brother of the impotent old man in order to establish the age-old practice of physical dominance of the male over the female. She develops a relation with a low caste runaway boy but the villagers catch them in the act of love-making and they are brought before the Panchayat. Devaki is made to stand holding a heavy stone on her head, the severity of the punishment aimed at setting an example to other women. The villagers and the Panchayat decide to auction Devaki to the highest bidder and pay the money to the 70-year-old husband. Once again, another old man buys her.
The live of Nandini (Perizaad Zorabian) is more complicated. In protest against the feudal practices in Devaki's village Nandini, an urban girl who has come to the village to work as an NGO activist trying to empower the village women through literacy and awareness, quits her job and goes back to the city. Soon, she finds out that in some respects urban life is no different to village life. Economically betrayed and physically used by her lover Rahul (Ram Kapur), she feels herself losing self-respect and betrayed and disillusioned by Rahul’s treatment of his pregnant wife, Sumana, and the lies he has been telling both women. She forces herself to end the illicit relationship and joins an advertising agency. But she is shocked to find out that her selfish father (George Baker), who had deserted the family many years ago, owns the agency. He doesn’t seem to remember the fact that he left behind a wife who is now in a mental asylum, still awaiting his return, and a daughter who he doesn’t recognize though she works for him. The ultimate betrayal comes when her father/boss advises her to satisfy his client sexually to clinch a deal and offers her 2% of the profit as a reward. She decides to sell herself to this lecherous old man, avenging her father’s betrayal by sacrificing herself. Her vindication comes in the form of his shock when she eventually tells him the truth!

Connie Blair

Connie Blair is the central character in a series of 12 mystery novels for adolescent girls written by Betty Cavanna under the pseudonym Betsy Allen. Cavanna wrote volumes 1 through 11. The author of volume 12 remains unknown. The series was published by Grosset & Dunlap between 1948 and 1958. Book titles were distinguished with a color in the title such as "The Clue in Blue" and "The Riddle in Red".
The series was initially published with dust jackets. When the first four titles were republished in the early 1960s, however, costs were cut by dispensing with the dust jackets in favor of full color cover illustrations. All twelve titles were published as paperbacks in the 1960s. In 1978, three titles were republished in paperback editions with entirely new cover illustrations.
In the beginning, teenager Connie Blair models clothes at an exclusive department store in Philadelphia. She then becomes a secretary at an advertising firm, and works her way to a more important position. Her various jobs are the backdrops for the mysteries she encounters and solves.
Criticism.
The Connie Blair series has been criticized for its sexism. As critic Bobbie Ann Mason writes, "he series stresses appearance, popularity, and femininity as I.D. card for entry into the business world" Mason cites several moments from the series in which Connie uses sex appeal, rather than brains, to achieve her goals: 
She put a hand on his arm and looked at him in a way that would have melted a stronger man.
She tried to look especially appealing and demure, because she wanted to get her information in a hurry.

Wilson Inlet

Wilson Inlet is an inlet located in the Great Southern region of Western Australia.
The inlet receives water from the two main rivers: the Denmark River and the Hay River and some smaller rivers and streams such as the Sleeman River, Little River and Cuppup Creek. It is located South East of the town of Denmark.
The inlet is a wave dominated estuary with an opening mouth that has a width of with a bar blocking it from late January to August. The inlet is separated into two basins, the Eastern and Western basin. 
The estuary is situated on a narrow coastal plain between granite hills to the north and the west and the coastal dunes to the south. The area of the inlet is and has an average depth of and its deepest point is . The inlet is long from East to West and has a width of 
The inlet has a total catchment area of covering parts of the Shire of Plantagenet, the Shire of Denmark and the City of Albany. 
The low lying land adjacent to the inlet consists of swamps with lakes to the East. The silt beds in the area indicate that it was of recent estuarine origin.
The majority of the catchment is contained within the Albany-Fraser geological province with the original granite overlaid with sands and laterite deposited in the Quaternary period.
History.
The inlet was formed 6000–8000 years ago when rising sea levels lead to an ancient river valley being flooded. 
The original human inhabitants of the inlet and surrounds were Indigenous Australian people, the Noongar. Many Aboriginal artefacts have been found in the area including fish traps, corroboree sites, ochre excavation site and campsites. 
The Noongar name for the Inlet is "Koorabup" which means "Place of the Black Swan". 
The area was discovered by Dr Thomas Wilson in his 1829 expedition from King George Sound (now Albany). The inlet was named after Wilson by Governor Stirling. 
The first Europeans to settle in the catchment area were Randall and Young families in the 1890s followed by timber mills constructed in 1895. Land clearing began in the 1920s and by 1982 46% of the catchment was privately owned.
In total 44% of the cathment has been cleared and 38% remains as forest and national parks.
Flora.
The inlet is fringed with "Juncus kraussi" a rush which forms a single species near the mouth of the inlet. 
"Melaleuca cuticularis", a salt tolerant paperbark also fringes the inlet and follows the channels and is present in the tidal parts of the rivers.
The salt marsh is predominantly made up of "Juncus kraussi", "Sarcocornia quinqueflora", and "Samolus repens".
Fauna.
The inlet is home to a mussel and oyster farm that as established in 2002. The farm operates on a lease on the South side of the inlet and completed their first harvest in 2005/2006. Blue mussels are produced using the longline cultivation technique and Belon Oysters are also cultivated using a similar technique.
An earlier operation had attempted to commercially produce blue mussels in he 1970s, but the small scale raft culture was destroyed by Cyclone Alby just prior to harvest.
Wilson Inlet is a key nursery for many juvenile fish species especially Pink Snapper which migrate from the Inlet to mature in the greater oceanic breeding stock. As a result of this the size of Pink Snapper that could be removed from the inlet was raised from to in July 2007.
Recreational fishing is popular within the inlet, that many species of fish inhabit including Cobbler, King George Whiting, Tailor, Mullet, Salmon Trout and Flathead. Other fish found in the estuary include Sandy Sprat, Yellow Eye Mullet, Sea Mullet and Blue Mackerel.
Many waterbird species inhabit the inlet and its surrounds including the Silver Gull, Australian Pelican, Black Swan, Little Black Cormorant, Grey Teal, Blue-billed Duck, Red-necked Avocet and the Australasian Shoveler.

Kuga Katsunan

Biography.
Kuga was born in Hirosaki, Mutsu Province (present day Aomori prefecture) to the official doctor of the Nambu daimyō of Hirosaki Domain. He attended Miyagi Normal School in Miyagi prefecture, but was forced to quit due to abusive behavior by its principal, a native of Satsuma Province. This marked the start of Kuga’s lifelong opposition to the "hanbatsu" system and domination of the Meiji government by natives of the former Satsuma and Chōshū domains. After leaving Miyagi, he enrolled in the Law School of the Ministry of Justice. However, he again failed to graduate, having been expelled together with Hara Takashi for a student protest against the school’s room and board policy. 
After a short period in Hokkaidō, Kuga returned to Tokyo to study the French language. In 1883, he started working at the Documentation Bureau of the Grand Council "(Dajōkan)" and there became acquainted with Inoue Kaoru. After the foundation of the cabinet system in 1885, he became an editing section chief at the Cabinet Gazette Bureau. In 1885, Kuga translated into Japanese some of the works of French conservative political philosopher Joseph de Maistre. During this period, Kuga’s own political philosophy tended towards opposition to the government’s Europeanization program as epitomized by the Rokumeikan, rejecting the current trend toward blind adulation of all things western, and rejection of Japanese history and Japanese moral values. He resigned from his government post in 1888. 
In April 1888, Kuga decided to publish a newspaper called , but due to reader confusion with the similarly named commercial newspaper , he changed the name in 1889 to simply . The newspaper was a platform for Kuga’s blend of idealistic Japanese nationalism and liberalism, which has been labelled "Nihon-shugi". Kuga wrote:
If a nation wishes to stand among the great powers and preserve its national independence, it must strive always to foster nationalism ("kokuminshugi")...If the culture of one country is so influenced by another that its completely loses its own unique character, that country will surely lose its independent footing.
Kuga used his newspaper to attack both political conservatives and entrenched bureaucracy in the government. As a result, it was a lightning rod drawing the wrath of government censors, but it also gained a wide readership. Between 1889 and 1896, government censors shut down Kuga's newspaper thirty times for a total of 260 days. Kuga's editorials on political morals influenced Tokyo Imperial University law professor Tatsukichi Minobe in the development of his controversial political theory, wherein he postulated that Emperor of Japan was an "organ" of government, existing for the welfare of the people and not with absolute arbitrary political power.
Kuga continued to serve as the president and main writer of the newspaper until he fell ill in 1906 of tuberculosis.
Kuga relocated from Tokyo to Kamakura, but his health failed to recover, and he died in 1907.
