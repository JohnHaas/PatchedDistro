Marquis of Angeja

Count of Vila Verde (in Portuguese "Conde de Vila Verde") was a Portuguese title of nobility created by a royal decree, dated from December 10, 1654, by King John IV of Portugal, and granted to "Dom" António de Noronha, 12th Lord of Vila Verde.
António de Noronha descended from Pedro de Noronha, Archbishop of Lisbon and a grandson of King Fernando I of Portugal (through his mother Infanta Isabel) and of King Henry II of Castile (through his father Alfonso, Count of Noroña y Gigon).
In the 18th century this family received new honours: a royal decree of King John V of Portugal, issued on January 21, 1714, created the title of Marquis of Angeja (in Portuguese "Marquês de Angeja") and granted it to Dom Pedro António de Noronha, 2nd Count of Vila Verde.
In 1833, these two titles were inherited by a collateral branch of the family: the Noronhas, Counts of Peniche.
Family Name.
The family name associated with these titles was "Noronha" – their ancestor Alfonso Enriquez (a natural son of King Henry II of Castile), was Count of Noroña, in Castile.
Due to different heritages and marriages some other family names were added (such as, Camões, Albuquerque Moniz e Sousa, Azevedo Coutinho) but the original "Noronha" was always kept.
Genealogical Summary.
António de Noronha, 1st Count of Vila Verde, was a 6th grandson of Pedro de Noronha, Archbishop of Lisbon, who lived in the late 14th/earlier 15th centuries. The Archbishop had royal ancestry both through his mother (Isabel of Portugal, a natural daughter of King Ferdinand I of Portugal) and through his father (Alfonso, Count of Noroña y Gigón, a natural son of King Henry II of Castile).

Phonic FM

Phonic FM is a community radio station in Exeter, Devon, England. The station was set up in 2008 and started broadcasting on 15th Feb 2008. Phonic FM was originally called Vibraphonic FM and broadcast as part of a one month Music Festival in the City of Exeter called The Vibraphonic Music Festival.
Initially the station was broadcasting using a Restricted Service Licence. This meant the station could only broadcast for one month a year during the festival but Phonic FM now has a five-year full-time broadcasting licence.
Shows include The Edge of Jazz, Music To Bake Cakes To, Scatman's Rockin' Radio Show, The Future Sound of Exeter Show, Revolutionary Radio, The On any Given Sunday Show, Ja-Fu-Re, A Head of the Curve a broadcast and podcast in-depth discussion show, and a differently presented breakfast show each day. The station pursues a "No Playlists" and "No Adverts" policy, and plays a wide range of other music including, "funk, soul, hip hop, blues, rock" and "alternative". From the end of 2008 it has also broadcast a classical music programme, an arts review programme, "blah blah blah" and a book review programme "The Mighty Book". From early 2009 it also has the capacity to record live and "as live" sessions from local musicians and bands in the adjacent 'Sound Gallery Studios'
In the June 2008 'Radio World International Edition' (Volume 36 #2) the station was described thus, "There is nothing quite like it on the U.K. dial. It is the perfect antidote for complaints about high rotation playlists, or that all stations these days sound much the same. This one certainly does not. Phonic.fm is a genuinely refreshing,genuine alternative, from which the best is yet to come"
More recently the Station was reviewed by the Times Online website ( Times Online Phonic FM review ) they said:
Trying to find a decent alternative music radio station in the UK has always proved tricky ... Now, however, a community radio station called Phonic in Exeter, Devon, is ticking all the right boxes and is providing some of the most inspiring broadcasting in the country.
<br><br>
Billed as Exeter’s "sound alternative" Phonic is funded by a grant from the local council, manned by volunteer staff, and has a remit to promote the culture of the city ... you always know some unexpected musical delight is not far away ... there is nothing quite like it in the UK.
In December 2009, Christian Brook writing in an article published in Times on Line said, "It's almost an alternative alternative station; it's not run of the mill singles and famous tracks that you'll hear (though there are a smattering of them) it's the obscure, seldom played album and session tracks that get an airing".
In November 2012 the regulator, OFCOM, offered a five year extension to the licence which will keep the station on air until February 2018.

Symphony No. 7 (Henze)

The Seventh Symphony by the German composer Hans Werner Henze was written in 1983-84. It was commissioned by the Berliner Philharmoniker as part of the orchestra's centenary celebrations in 1982.
Unlike its immediate predecessors, Henze has stated that this work is very much a 'German' symphony, in the Beethovenian tradition. Accordingly, it is cast in four movements and is broadly analogous to the 'classical' form: Introduction, slow movement, Scherzo and Finale. However Henze uses even more traditional German motifs across the movements: an "allemande" (a German dance) in the first and "Liedform" in the second. For the two final movements he focuses on the eighteenth-century poet Friedrich Hölderlin, incarcerated at Tübingen where he was subjected to what amounted to torture in the name of medical intervention. The final movement is a deeply lyrical orchestral setting of Hölderlin's late poem "Hälfte des Lebens" ("Half of Life").
Performances.
The premiere was given by the Berliner Philharmoniker under Gianluigi Gelmetti in 1984. In that performance the work took 46 minutes. Sir Simon Rattle's 1992 recording takes 38 minutes, and Marek Janowski's 2007 recording slightly under 35.

When the town was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1857, he was elected as one of the corporation's first aldermen. In 1864 he was chosen as mayor of the borough, and held the office for three years in succession. As mayor he laid the foundation stone of the Victoria Market Hall in 1868.
In 1868 Stalybridge was enfranchised as a parliamentary borough, returning one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons. Sidebottom was nominated as the Conservative candidate, and was elected as the town's first MP.
He became ill in 1870, and died at his residence "Acre Banks", Stalybridge, in February 1871, aged 47.

Ray Griggs is a director, writer and producer in Hollywood, California, and owner of RG Entertainment, Ltd. His 2009 project, "Super Capers", a family comedy about an ordinary person joining a host of low-key superheroes, stars Tom Sizemore, Doug Jones and Christine Lakin.
Griggs is also known for creating an 8-minute film short "Lucifer" about the Biblical account of the fallen angel and subsequent war in heaven. The award-winning short starred Jason Lewis as Lucifer and Bru Muller as the archangel Michael.
In 2010, Griggs filmed a conservative documentary about socialism and the role of government in society entitled "I Want Your Money". The film, slated to be released October 15 nationwide, features interviews with economists, conservative personalities and government officials.
Griggs' latest project is a film adaptation of Wind in the Willows. The film will include special effects by Weta Workshop and is scheduled to begin filming in New Zealand in fall 2010.
Controversy.
On Nov. 12, 2009, it was reported that Apple rejected Griggs' iPhone application which enabled the user to contact every US Congressman or Senator based on GPS coordinates. The application also featured animated bobble head caricatures of each representative. A caricature of US Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi was deemed "objectionable" and among the reasons for rejection. On Nov. 14, amid rising controversy, Apple reversed its decision and approved the application for its online store.
On Dec. 7, 2009, the Rachel Maddow show commented on an ad made by Griggs against the health care bills in Congress, in which many white people and one black man say, "I guess I'm a racist," in response to Jesse Jackson's statement of Nov. 18, 2009, "You can't vote against healthcare and call yourself a black man."

In Your House 3

In Your House 3: Triple Header was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), which took place on September 24, 1995 at the Saginaw Civic Center in Saginaw, Michigan. Seven matches aired on the broadcast.
Background.
In Your House 3 featured professional wrestling matches involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that were played out on "Monday Night Raw" — the World Wrestling Federation's television programs. Wrestlers portrayed a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches.
Event.
In the main event, three championships were on the line: Diesel's WWF Championship, Shawn Michaels' WWF Intercontinental Championship, and Yokozuna and Owen Hart's WWF Tag Team Championship. If Diesel had been pinned, he would have lost the WWF Championship and if Michaels had been pinned he would have lost the Intercontinental Championship. The British Bulldog replaced Hart in the match, as Hart with his wife at the hospital, as she was giving birth to their second child. In the match, Diesel pinned Hart, who had come down to ringside during the match, after a Jacknife powerbomb. As Hart was not legally in the match, the title change was disallowed.

Christopher Hope

Christopher Hope, FRSL (born 26 February 1944) is a South African novelist and poet who is known for his controversial works dealing with racism and politics in South Africa.
Life.
Christopher Hope was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to Dudley Mitford and Kathleen Margaret Hope. As a White South African, Hope questioned the special treatment of Caucasians in that country. These feelings would eventually work their way into Hope's most famous writings. Hope was educated at the University of Witwatersrand and the University of Natal. He served in the South African Navy beginning in 1962. Hope married Eleanor Marilyn Margaret Klein 18 February 1967. The couple would eventually divorce. Hope worked briefly as a journalist before leaving on a "self-imposed" exile to London, England. His autobiographical piece, "White Boy Running", chronicles this time of Hope's life.
Career.
Hope's poetry was first published in "Whitewashes", a poetry book that was released in 1971. In 1974, his poetry was published as "Cape Drives", a collection of original prose. Hope's first novel, "A Separate Development", was published in 1981. The novel was banned in South Africa for its overt criticisms of the Apartheid government.
Hope's second novel,"Kruger's Alp," was considered a stark contrast to his first work. "Kruger's Alp" was described by the "New York Times Book Review" as "a novel in the form of a dream allegory". Despite its departure from Hope's earlier writings, "Kruger's Alp" was greeted with critical acclaim.
Hope's other novels include "The Hottentot Room", "Darkest England", and "My Mother's Lovers". Hope has also penned a memoir entitled "White Boy Running", several plays, and two pieces of juvenile fiction.
Awards.
Over the course of his career, Hope has earned a number of prestigious writing awards. "Cape Drives" won Hope the Thomas Pringle Prize and a Cholmondeley Award. "A Separate Development" was the recipient of the David Higham Memorial Prize. Hope won the Whitbread Prize in 1984 for "Kruger's Alp". Hope has also been awarded the Professor Alexander Petrie Award, the Silver Pen Award, and in 1992 short listed for the Man Booker Prize with "Serenity House".

Pigs in the City

Pigs in the City is a public art initiative coordinated by Uptown Lexington, Inc., a non-profit organization created to revitalize the downtown (or locally called "uptown") area of Lexington. It includes an annual event held in the fall in the uptown business district of Lexington, North Carolina U.S., the self-proclaimed "Barbecue Capital of the World". It is part of a larger downtown revitalization effort which has gained significant media attention due its unusual artistic display of full-size ornamental pigs and draws visitors from all over North Carolina. The event is free to the public.
History.
During the 2004 “North Carolina Main Street” 24th Annual Awards Banquet, Pigs in the City won "Best Downtown Special Event" for their first event in 2003. The event drew over 40,000 visitors from all over the state in its first year. It became an annual event after 2006. The cost to "sponsor" one of the 20 pigs on display was $1,000 during the first exhibition, which paid for the initiative. There was some controversy as the "Root for the Troops" pig was stolen from its perch in front of the Army & Navy Store on Main Street.
The fourth annual "Pigs in the City" event was held from May 23 through October 23, 2008, and was called "Power of the Pig." The pigs were also on display during the 25th Anniversary Lexington Barbecue Festival and during the "Official Food Festival of the Piedmont Triad Region of the State of North Carolina," a one-day event that usually draws up to 150,000 visitors from all over the nation to Lexington, a town of about 20,000 residents.
Some of the themes for Pigs in the City 4 include "Pigahontas", "Tanya "Cabbage Patch" Burcham", "This Little Piggy went to Market", "Mr. Porkwrench", "Huckleberry Pig" and "Girl Snout".
Display.
A number of artistic pigs are on display throughout the walkway of uptown Lexington, around the entire city square. The pigs are primarily made of fiberglass, and decorated and painted by local artists, each with their own theme. While some pigs are displayed for more than one year, new pigs are created for each year's display.
Gallery.
Some of these are past entries that are now on permanent display throughout Lexington, or at Uptown Lexington, Inc. main office.

Arthur Hildersham

Arthur Hildersham (1563–1632) was an English clergyman, a Puritan and nonconforming preacher.
Life.
Arthur Hildersham was born at Stetchworth, and brought up as a Roman Catholic. He was educated in Saffron Walden and at Christ's College, Cambridge. Through the patronage of Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, he became vicar of St Helen's Church, Ashby-de-la-Zouch. According to Benjamin Brook, the Leicestershire connection was through the good offices of John Ireton, who became vicar of Kegworth, and who offered help to Hildersham when his family objected to his conversion to Protestantism. He was literary executor, with John Dod, to Thomas Cartwright, who died in 1603.
He was one of the promoters of the Millenary Petition, with Stephen Egerton. It was presented to James I in 1603; but he was excluded from the subsequent Hampton Court Conference, where four moderate voices represented the Puritan trend. He was deprived of his living in 1605, and then relied on lecturing positions. William Lilly (born 1602) was educated in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and described the "silenced" Hildersham in his "History of His Life and Times". Lilly's teacher was John Brinsley the elder, one of Hildersham's circle.
One place he was a lecturer was at Burton-on-Trent. With Peter Eccleshall he had been conducting a 'common exercise' in Burton by 1596. Related to this religious activity was the case of Thomas Darling, who became celebrated as a result of efforts at exorcism. Hildersham supported the exorcist John Darrell. Also he had connections with the heresy case of Edward Wightman, burned in 1612.
Around 1615 he encountered Francis Higginson, who in 1629 settled in Salem, Massachusetts. Under Hildersham's influence he became a nonconformist, setting off the train of events leading to Higginson's emigration.
Family.
He had royal blood, being a great-grandson of Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury, the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. This accounts for the story that Elizabeth I called him “cousin Hildersham”.
Samuel Hildersham (1594?–1674), Westminster Divine and minister ejected in 1662, was his son.

This duckweed is one of Britain's most common small water plants, which forms familiar green mats covering stagnant water bodies. It has a simple plant body, known as a thallus, which floats on the surface of the water and measures up to five millimetres in diameter. A single root hangs down into the water. Found in a wide range of still or slow-flowing water bodies, common duckweed can also occur on mud or damp rocks.
Widespread throughout Britain, but is absent from much of Scotland and Shetland. Elsewhere the species has a very wide global distribution, absent only from polar areas and the tropics.
Distribution information for this species can be accessed via the Charms of Duckweed (worldwide) and National Biodiversity Network Gateway (Britain only).
This species spreads mainly through vegetative reproduction, but flowers are occasionally produced in shallow water exposed to the full sun. When covering the entire surface of a pond, it can make the water appear solid, and in parts of the north-west of England children were scared away from such ponds by the myth of Jenny Green-teeth, a pond elf or monster whose presence was indicated by duckweed; she was said to lure children into ponds and drown them.

PvP Battles.
In Fragoria there are special PvP-locations on which battles between characters are resolved. Basically, it is locations for characters above 15 levels.
For convenience of battles between characters there are some PvP -modes:
On some locations there is special PvP a zone - Arena. It is presented by the round closed arena on which there is not enough place for movings. On arena two characters having a difference on levels. Having exposed the character on duel and having waited the opponent, you need to make preliminary rates on an outcome of duel. To generate prize-winning fund which is received by the winner. On arena the opportunity to make the rate on "death" of fights also is given to spectators of fights.
"Many guilds from different servers fights with each other on special lands and on special boss events. At the same time there are many PVP games like "Capture the flag", "King of the hill", "Last man standing" where players can enjoy the game and get the reward with a short time."
Pets.
Characters can have pets. Pet is a character’s companion, able to help in a difficult situation, to protect in fight, to strengthen the character or to weaken the opponent. Companions serve as true assistants in fight, both against monsters and against other characters.

Adalbert of Pomerania

Adalbert of Pomerania (, ) (born before 1124; died 1162) was the first bishop of the 12th century Pomeranian bishopric, with its see in Wolin (also Jumne, Julin). He was a monk of the Michaelsberg Abbey, Bamberg and former chaplain to Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland, whence he knew the Pomeranian language of the temporarily Polish-subjugated West Slavic population, whereas the Joms Vikings and other Germanic inhabitants of the Pomeranian coast understood his old German language.
The territory was put under the jurisdiction of the archbishopric of Magdeburg by Holy Roman emperor Otto I, King of Germany. In 1133 the Magdeburg archbishop Saint Norbert received verification by the pope of his jurisdiction over a number of dioceses, including those in Pomerania. However, bishop Otto of Bamberg had actually baptized the Pomeranians and therefore thought to add it to his southern Bamberg archdiocese and in order to avoid conflicts, pope Innocent II exempted the Pomeranian bishopric(s). When Wolin was destroyed several times by Danes, the diocese was moved to Cammin (also Kammin, now Kamien Pomorskie); this bishopric became known as the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kammin.
The priest Adalbert participated in the conversion of the pagan inhabitants of Pomerania (Lutici and Slavic Pomeranians) during the missionary expeditions of Otto of Bamberg in 1124 and 1128, when he aided Otto as his assistant and interpreter. Adalbert is assumed to be of Polish origin.
In 1139 Otto of Bamberg died and was followed by Egilbert of Bamberg, who received the jurisdiction over the Pomeranian diocese. In 1140 Adalbert went to Rome, where he was invested as bishop of Pomerania in Wolin from 1140 to 1162.

1993 FA Charity Shield

The 1993 FA Charity Shield was the 71st FA Charity Shield, an annual football match played between the winners of the previous season's Premier League and FA Cup competitions. It was held at Wembley Stadium on 7 August 1993. The match was played between Manchester United, champions of the 1992–93 Premier League and Arsenal, who beat Sheffield Wednesday to win the 1993 FA Cup Final. Watched by a crowd of 66,519, Manchester United won the Shield 5–4 on penalties, after the match had finished at 1–1 after 90 minutes.
This was Manchester United's 17th Charity Shield appearance and Arsenal's 12th. The 1993 staging of the event was the first to feature players wearing permanent squad numbers; this became common practise in time for the 1993–94 season. It was scheduled for a 12:30pm kick-off, for the benefit of television. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and Arsenal manager George Graham revealed their intention to win the Shield before the match, in spite of it treated as a friendly.
Roy Keane made his debut for Manchester United in the match; he partnered Paul Ince in midfield. United began the match the brighter of the two teams and scored after eight minutes of play, through Mark Hughes. Striker Eric Cantona spurned two chances to extend United's lead, by which point Arsenal's midfield started to assert themselves. Five minutes before the interval, Ian Wright capitalised on an mistake by Ryan Giggs to score the equaliser. Arsenal started the second half as the better side, which prompted Ferguson to tweak his formation and bring on Bryan Robson in place of Giggs. Eddie McGoldrick came on for his Arsenal debut in the 74th minute, and two minutes later, United were denied a penalty after Ince was brought down by John Jensen.
As there were no further goals, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Wright and Denis Irwin missed their penalties; the decisive penalty, taken by Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman, was saved by his opposite number, Peter Schmeichel. The Charity Shield was presented to Manchester United captain Steve Bruce by former footballer Billy Wright. Graham admitted he did not know the match was to be decided on penalties, and thought it was unfortunate Seaman missed. Ferguson was delighted with the win and his team's start to the game, but suggested it should not have been settled by a shoot-out.
Background.
The FA Charity Shield was founded in 1908 as a contest between the top professional and amateur teams of each season. It was played between the Football League champions and FA Cup winners for the first time in 1921; the formation of a new top-tier division, the Premier League, in 1992 meant it displaced the Football League spot. Wembley Stadium acted as the home venue of the Shield. Players in the 1993 staging of the Charity Shield were the first in the competition to wear permanent squad numbers and names on the back of their shirts. The Premier League intended to introduce this at the start of the 1992–93 season, but Manchester United vetoed plans "because their laundry room was too small to handle all the extra shirts".
Manchester United qualified for the 1993 FA Charity Shield as winners of the inaugural Premier League season. It was their first league title in 26 years and goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel felt the signing of striker Eric Cantona was a factor in the team's success: "He has added an element of surprise, imagination, inventiveness." The other Charity Shield place went to Arsenal, who defeated Sheffield Wednesday in a replay match of the 1993 FA Cup Final. Arsenal completed a domestic cup double; they beat Sheffield Wednesday 2–1 in the 1993 Football League Cup Final.
This was Manchester United's first appearance in the Charity Shield in three years; prior to this event they won 10 Shields outright (1908, 1911, 1952, 1956, 1957, 1983), shared four (1965, 1967, 1977, 1990) and lost three (1948, 1963, 1985). By contrast, Arsenal won seven previous Shields (1930, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1938, 1948, 1953), shared one with Tottenham Hotspur in 1991 and lost four (1935, 1936, 1979, 1989).
Pre-match.
Both managers approached the match with a view to win, in spite of the game traditionally taken as a friendly. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said "Winning means keeping your job, and it can be a delicate situation. But I tell myself I'm not going to fail in this game;" his opponent, George Graham opined "Winning is a good habit, so why not start early?" The Arsenal manager lambasted those who found his team's playing style tedious: "The criticism that we don't pass the ball and we don't have flair is overdone. We won two championships and in the second lost one game out of 38." Ferguson spoke in glowing terms of new signing Roy Keane, a midfielder who gave United "unbelievable options, a real edge to the squad".
The match was scheduled for a 12:30pm kick-off given Sky Sports televised the match in Scotland and England; they were unable to pick an afternoon slot because of the television blackout, which aimed to protect Scottish attendances. UEFA warned The Football Association in the lead-up to the Charity Shield that a 3pm kick-off would result in a minimum fine of £5 million. Deryk Brown of "The Sunday Times" wrote of the decision: "So, at least, the season is beginning as it will go on, at the mercy of television." Tickets for the game were advertised at a cost of between £10 and £30.
Match.
Team selection.
Ferguson deployed a 4–2–4 formation, with Paul Ince partnering debutant Keane in the midfield two. Andrei Kanchelskis was preferred to Lee Sharpe on the left wing. Arsenal lined up in a 4–4–2 formation; Eddie McGoldrick started his first game for the team, while Kevin Campbell partnered Ian Wright upfront.
Summary.
Manchester United began the first half the better of the two teams and led from the eighth minute. Denis Irwin's cross into Arsenal's penalty area found Eric Cantona on the right side; he lobbed the ball in Mark Hughes' direction, who was surrounded by the Arsenal defenders. Hughes instinctively made a connection with the ball with an overhead shot that beat goalkeeper David Seaman at the near post. United fashioned another chance to score moments after; Keane fed the ball to Cantona whose shot was blocked by Seaman. Kanchelskis created a further chance for Cantona; the Frenchman's effort once more was denied, this time by an Arsenal defender. "These proved costly misses", opined Patrick Barclay, given United's tempo weakened, and Arsenal's John Jensen and Paul Davis started to impose themselves in midfield. United captain Steve Bruce coped well against Campbell and Wright, but the latter striker equalised for Arsenal in the 40th minute. A loose pass from Ryan Giggs was headed-on by Davis and the ball fell to Wright. He, "some 20 yards out", hit the ball first time, which dipped past the underside of the crossbar.
A tackle by Ince on Lee Dixon left the Arsenal defender with a damaged ankle; he came off at half time and was replaced by Martin Keown. Arsenal's performance improved after Wright's goal; Paul Merson, a quiet figure in the first half, influenced their play in the second. Ferguson responded to Arsenal's new-found impetus by substituting Giggs for Bryan Robson. This tweaked United's formation to 4–3–3; in spite of Ince's well-rounded performance, his partner Keane started to tire as the game went on and United's game therefore suffered. Keane was shifted onto the right to accommodate Robson, who brought control to United's play. Nigel Winterburn prevented Cantona from scoring, after good play by Kanchelskis. Arsenal's service to Wright and Campbell was "sporadic" by contrast, but both players tested Schmeichel in goal. Eddie McGoldrick came on for his Arsenal debut in the 74th minute, a versatile player, able to "sweep, score from midfield or play wide". Two minutes later, Seaman denied Keane from scoring with a one-handed save. United continued to attack and a move was broken down after Jensen's tackle brought Ince down in the Arsenal's penalty area. Gerald Ashby refused to award a penalty; "the referee's decision otherwise was not supported by television replays".
No further goals meant the game was decided on a penalty shoot-out. The first four penalties were scored – Ince and Bruce for United and Winterburn and Jensen for Arsenal, before Seaman saved Irwin's effort. Wright missed his penalty, prompting jeers from the United supporters. The shoot-out proceeded to sudden death; Robson scored and Seaman "saw his gentle penalty saved by his opposite number" to give United a 5–4 win and thereby the Shield.
Post-match.
The shield was presented to Bruce by former Arsenal manager Billy Wright. Wright died barely a year later, aged 70. Graham assumed both clubs would share the trophy, so when it came to a penalty shoot-out he entrusted his players to decide their order. He described Wright's goal as "brilliant" and felt it was "unfortunate" that Seaman missed: "For a goalkeeper, he normally takes great penalties. He normally hits them hard but he decided to try and place this one and it didn't work." Wright was unashamed of his penalty miss, "…just as long as I don't do it when it is important".
Ferguson remarked the Shield should not have been settled on penalties; to him it was a "celebration of success", though ultimately was delighted his team won. He was pleased with United's start – "I thought in the first 25 minutes we were really good and could have tied the match up then" – and considered lining the team up in a 4–3–3 formation to begin with, though wanted to see "how Keane played with Ince, what the balance was like". Ince believed he should have been awarded a penalty after Jensen fouled him: "I was past their last man and there was no way I would have dived from there."

The band was formed by Jamie Eichler of the Violet Burning, Dean Tapia, Andrew Prickett of The Prayer Chain, and husband Brian Eichler.
For a time the band was a worship band for Vineyard Church, and this was reflected in their music in many ways. Their music was said to have an "acoustic slant" and a strong emotional pull, helped along by female vocalist Jamie Eichler. Overall their sound was similar to that of Over the Rhine or Innocence Mission.
In early 1996 they toured with the Lost Dogs.

Other bands brought to Toronto included The Byrds and Pentangle.
Film.
Ken became involved in the film industry in Toronto, Ontario in the early 1970s. He produced the ultra-low budget Dream On The Run in 1973 and was production manager on another no-budget Canadian feature Point of No Return. In 1977, he produced the low-budget sci-fi film Starship Invasions, which was distributed by Warner Bros. and in 1979, The High Country for Crown International. He continued to production manage and/or line produce other low-budget films and television shows, Deadly Eyes, Loose Screws, Recruits, Busted Up, Mr. Nice Guy, The Housekeeper, The Edison Twins and The Brain, through the 1980s.
In 1986, he was co-producer on Criminal Law (film), the first feature directed by Martin Campbell, starring Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon. The movie was produced for Hemdale Film Corporation and distributed by Warner Bros.
In 1988, he was the Canadian Executive in Charge of Production on the mini-series Day One, for CBS and Aaron Spelling Productions, which won an Emmy in 1989 for Best Drama Special.
In 1991 and 1992, Ken produced two seasons of the CBS late-night crime show Sweating Bullets (aka Tropical Heat) in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and Eilat, Israel.
Which led him to what he was perhaps best known for, as the producer of the hit syndicated series which filmed six seasons through the 1990s. Mr. Gord was brought in at the beginning of season 2 and stayed as the creative producer until the last episode was filmed in Paris in 1998. The series was nominated for a Canadian Gemini Award as Best Dramatic Series in 1992.
Since then, he produced other syndicated series, such as the Paris episodes of "Relic Hunter" and a season of "Queen of Swords", shot in Almeria, Spain at Texas Hollywood.

These included CBS's "Daughter of Darkness", which starred Anthony Perkins and Model By Day, starring Famke Janssen. In 2006, he produced Eight Days to Live, which was the most successful in-house television movie ever broadcast on CTV, and also broke records on the Lifetime Network. It was nominated for a Canadian Gemini Award as Best Television Movie in 2007.
In 2007, Ken produced Stuck (2007 film), directed by Stuart Gordon and starring Mena Suvari and Stephen Rea to high critical acclaim. The New York Times called it a "...grim, expert little thriller..."

Temple Kol Ami (Thornhill, Ontario)

Temple Kol Ami is a Reform Jewish congregation in Thornhill, Ontario, Canada.
The congregation was founded in 1988 by a small group of families. Their vision was to establish a Reform synagogue that was inclusive and welcoming, where prayer was joyous, personal, and meaningful; and so Kol Ami began. The first services were held in members' homes, and later at the Dufferin Clark Community Centre.
In 1990, Rabbi Nancy Wechsler joined the congregation as its first rabbi. Services and Religious School were being held within the Leo Baeck Day School, first on Kenton Avenue in North York, and later at Leo Baeck’s new campus on Atkinson Avenue in Thornhill. Cantorial Soloist Dawn Bernstein added her vocal talents in 1994. 
Daniel Gottlieb became the congregation's rabbi in 1996 and continued to 2011. During his tenure the Kol Ami community grew exponentially, truly becoming a presence in York Region. Throughout this time the congregation pursued its dream of establishing a permanent home. Several options were explored, including building an independent facility or joining the community campus on Bathurst Street.
Finally, the seeds were planted of what can best be described as a “There’s no place like home” movement. Rather than build a separate facility, the decision was taken to create a permanent partnership with the Leo Baeck Day School. Extensive renovations and beautification of the school's sanctuary and lobby, as well as the construction of offices, a chapel, and youth lounge, yielded a space that could serve as home to both institutions. Finally, Kol Ami had come home... for good.
With the appointment of Rabbi Micah Streiffer in the summer of 2011 and the redesign and renovation of sacred spaces within Leo Baeck now completed, Kol Ami finds itself spiritually and physically at home, nestled comfortably in the heart of Jewish York Region. The congregation continues to grow and thrive.

<doc id="20069528" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20069528" title="POET">
POET

POET LLC is a U.S. biofuel company that specializes in the creation of bioethanol. The privately held corporation, which was originally called Broin Companies, is headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. In 2007, the Renewable Fuels Association named POET the largest U.S. ethanol producer, creating of fuel per year. Currently, POET produces 1.7 billion gallons of ethanol per year.
POET operates 27 ethanol plants spread across Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Minnesota, and South Dakota. In 2007, the company received a US$80 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy for the creation of a cellulosic ethanol production facility in Emmetsburg, Iowa. This facility is currently under construction and is expected to begin full operations in 2013. It is expected to produce 25 million gallons of ethanol per year from corncobs, leaves and husks provided by farmers in and around the area.
POET has also collaborated with other companies, including Deere & Co. and Vermeer Company, to develop manufacturing equipment for harvesting corn cobs used in ethanol production. Among its products in the process are Distillers grains branded Dakota Gold, and Voila.
History.
The company traces its history to the family farm in Wanamingo, Minnesota where the Lowell and Jeff Broins began producing ethanol in 1983. In 1986 it became commercial launching its flagship plant in Scotland, South Dakota in foreclosed ethanol plant under the corporate name Broin Farms which became Broin Companies.
In 2007, it was renamed POET. Then company president Jeff Broin said the new name is not an acronym. He said, “We wanted a name that would represent, rather than describe, who we are and what we do...As a poet takes everyday words and turns them into something valuable and beautiful; we use creativity that comes from common sense to leave things better than we found them.”
The reorganization changes the following company names:
Its plants have been visited by George W. Bush in Wentworth, South Dakota in April 2002 and by Barack Obama in Macon, Missouri in April 2010.
In April 2012 Jeff Broin moved from CEO to Executive Chairman of the Board, and Jeff Lautt became President and CEO. Lautt had been president since 2011.
Cellulosic ethanol.
Poet has constructed an $8 million pilot plant to produce cellulosic ethanol made from corn cobs and other crop residue. This project was undertaken as a joint venture with Royal DSM under the name POET-DSM Advanced Biofuels, LLC. A federal loan guarantee was obtained in July, 2011 for a commercial-scale plant to be built in Emmetsburg, Iowa. This loan guarantee was later declined when the joint venture with Royal DSM was announced.

List of National Cadet Special Activities

This is a list of National Cadet Special Activities conducted by Civil Air Patrol as a part of its congressional missions (Emergency Services, Aerospace Education, and Cadet Programs). Below is a partial list of activities offered nationally during 2008:
Air Force Careers.
As the official auxiliary of the United States Air Force, CAP has access to USAF facilities and personnel. The Air Force sponsors several schools, each of which focuses on a different area of Air Force culture.
Air Force Pararescue Orientation Course.
In this physically demanding activity, Cadets work with actual Pararescuemen learning land navigation, wilderness survival, climbing and rappelling and other Pararescue-related skills. This course is often abbreviated PJOC.
Air Force Space Command Familiarization Courses.
Designed for Cadets with an interest in space-related careers, this course provides an in-depth look at the capabilities and responsibilities of Air Force Space Command. Cadets learn about missile operations, space command and control, and orbital mechanics.
Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training Familiarization Courses.
A glimpse of the training that makes an Air Force pilot, this school includes heavy academics, flight facilities tours and simulator time. This course was previously known as the Air Education and Training Command Familiarization Course.
Aviation Careers.
Aircraft Maintenance & Manufacturing Orientation Course.
Co-sponsored by Cessna, this activity shows aircraft construction and maintenance techniques. Students receive tours of the Cessna Aircraft factory.
Airline Careers Exploration.
A hands on activity where cadets learn about careers within the airline industry. Students work with pilots, air traffic controllers, mechanics and flight attendants to better understand how Airlines operate.
National Blue Beret Activity.
Participants help conduct EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the world's largest airshow. This is a 'working vacation' and duties include aircraft marshaling, crowd control and ELT deactivation.
National Flight Academy (Powered & Glider).
Cadets who are at least 14 years old for glider and 16 for powered are eligible for the week-long National Flight Academy (NFA). Here, cadets go through high intensity instructive training both on the ground and in the air. Academies for powered flight (operating CAP Cessna 172 models) and glider flight (operating CAP LET L-13 Blaník models) are separate, so students may choose to apply to and attend either or both.
Cadets are paired with instructors and take daily flight lessons based on lessons learned in daily ground school sessions, as well as nightly homework readings. In addition, students are required to be prepared for any emergency that may threaten the aircraft or crew.
The purpose of NFA is to guarantee 10 hours of quality flight instruction to the students. However, due to the high intensity training, most students, pending their instructors permission, will be given the opportunity to solo, or pre-solo in the case of gliders, the aircraft. Depending on the academy, anywhere from 50-80% of student will graduate with their solo rating.
EAA Air Academy.
In addition to orientation flight time, Cadets study the flight, weather, navigation and aircraft construction.
Space Camp.
Cadets participate in United States Space Camp, conducted at the United States Space & Rocket Center, this course focuses on space exploration, and features flight simulation, physiology, crew equipment and more.
Aviation Challenge.
CAP sponsors cadets to participate in the Aviation Challenge. This activity is not exclusive to CAP members.
Leadership Careers.
Cadet Officer School.
Based on the Air Force's Squadron Officer's School, Cadet Officer School is CAP's keystone leadership school. Open to cadet officers, it is held at the Air University at Maxwell AFB and teaches critical thinking, active decision making, operational and strategic leadership, and air power theories, as well as relating the principles learned at the school into real life situations.
Civic Leadership Academy.
Held in Washington, D.C., this course explores the functions of American government and political processes.

<doc id="20069574" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20069574" title="Li Su">
Li Su

Li Su (李愬) (773–821), courtesy name Yuanzhi (元直), formally Duke Wu of Liang (涼武公), was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty. He was most well—known for his surprise attack on Cai Prefecture (蔡州, in modern Zhumadian, Henan), then held by the warlord Wu Yuanji, successfully capturing Wu.
Background.
Li Su was born in 773, during the reign of Emperor Daizong. His father was Li Sheng, who would later rise to prominence as a major general during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong. When Li Su was young, on account of his father's accomplishments, he was first made "Xielü Lang" (協律郎), a low-level official in charge of music at the ministry of worship (太常寺, "Taichang Si"), and later the deputy minister of army supplies (衛尉少卿, "Weiwei Shaoqing"). His birth mother died early, so he was raised by another concubine of Li Sheng's, Lady Wang, who was created the Lady of Jin. When Lady Wang died, Li Sheng, because she was not his wife, did not have Li Su observe the mourning rites for a mother, but Li Su tearfully requested to be allow to observe those rituals, and Li Sheng agreed.
After Li Sheng died in 793, Li Su and his brother Li Xian (李憲) built a tent next to Li Sheng's tomb, intending to observe the mourning period there. Emperor Dezong, believing the conditions were too harsh, ordered them to return to their own mansion, but after they went home for one night, the next day they were at the tomb again, and Emperor Dezong allowed them to continue to observe the mourning period there. After the mourning period was over, Li Su was made a member of the staff of Li Song the Crown Prince. He later served successively as the prefect of Fang (坊州, in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi) and then Jin (晉州, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) Prefectures, and was given the honorary title "Jinzi Guanglu Daifu" (金紫光祿大夫) on account of his virtues. He later was recalled to again serve on the Crown Prince's staff, and later served as the head of the Crown Prince's household.
During Emperor Xianzong's reign.
During the campaign against Wu Yuanji.
It was said that Li Su was full of strategies and capable in horsemanship and archery. In 816, during the reign of Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong, imperial troops were conducting a campaign against the warlord Wu Yuanji, who controlled Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan)) without imperial approval, two successive imperial generals put in command of nearby Tangsuideng Circuit (唐隨鄧, headquartered in modern Zhumadian) — Gao Xiayu (高霞寓) and Yuan Zi — had suffered defeats by Zhangyi troops. Li Su volunteered to serve in the campaign, and the chancellor Li Fengji also knew of Li Su's abilities, and therefore recommended him. Emperor Xianzong thus made Li Su the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Tangsuideng Circuit, as well as the prefect of its capital Tang Prefecture (唐州), replacing Yuan.
When Li Su reached the front in spring 817, it was said that the Tangsuideng soldiers, having suffered many defeats, were fearful of war. Li Su first comforted them by stating that his intentions were not to engage in battles immediately, and further personally attended to the wounded, to try to raise the morale. He also acted as if he was not taking military discipline seriously and not taking precautions toward Zhangyi troops, in order to get Zhangyi's guards down toward him. With Li Su not being well-known and the Zhangyi troops having just defeated Gao and Yuan, Zhangyi did not take particular precautions toward Li Su.
Li Su, meanwhile, requested and received reinforcements from several circuits. He then began to carry out military actions in which he targeted Zhangyi officers, captured them, and then treated them well and incorporated them into his command structure, using their familiarity with Zhangyi's defenses against Zhangyi. Such Zhangyi officers he thus captured included Ding Shiliang (丁士良), Chen Guangqia (陳光洽), Wu Xiulin (吳秀琳), Li Xian (李憲, whose name Li Su changed to Li Zhongyi (李忠義)), and Li You. His soldiers were particularly displeased at his endearment of Li You, pointing out that Li You had killed many imperial soldiers, and further accused Li You of being an agent of Wu. Li Su, in order to calm the soldiers, delivered Li You to Chang'an, ostensibly for Emperor Xianzong to execute him — and instead sent a secret petition to Emperor Xianzong, stating that he could not succeed if Li You were executed. Emperor Xianzong thereafter pardoned Li You and delivered him back to Li Su. Li Su further abolished the former orders that those who took in Zhangyi spies would be executed — instead ordering his people that if Zhangyi spies arrived, they were to be treated with kindness. As a result, the Zhangyi spies were turned toward Li Su and informed him about the status of Zhangyi troops.
By summer 817, Li Su was formulating the strategy of making a surprise attack on Zhangyi's capital Cai Prefecture with Li You and Li Zhongyi, and he set apart 3,000 elite soldiers, calling them the "Tujiang" (突將), and trained them for this purpose. After a battle in which he failed in capturing Langshan (朗山, in modern Zhumadian), the Tangsuideng troops were depressed, but Li Su stated happily, "This fits within my plans." However, he could not launch his attack on Cai Prefecture at that time, with heavy rains drenching the land at that time.
In fall 817, in a battle where Li Su attacked Wufang (吳房, in modern Zhumadian), Li Su launched the attack on a day considered to be "wangwang" (往亡, i.e., a particular inopportune day for military action) on the Chinese calendar, against his officers' reservations, he caught the Wufang defenders unaware and quickly captured the outer city, forcing them to withdraw within the inner city. Li Su then withdrew to try to draw them out. Their commander Sun Xianzhong (孫獻忠) thereafter attacked Li Su's rear. When Li Su's own soldiers panicked, Li Su got off his horse and sat on a chair, stating, "Anyone who dares to retreat further will be beheaded." His soldiers thereafter fought back and killed Sun. When they then suggested that he attack Wufang's inner city and capture it, he responded, "That is not within my plan." He then withdrew back to his own camp.
Meanwhile, with another imperial general, Li Guangyan the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (忠武, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), frequently prevailing over Zhangyi forces, the most elite Zhangyi troops were stationed at Huiqu (洄曲, in modern Luohe, Henan), to defend against a possible Li Guangyan advancement. Li You thus suggested to Li Su that the defenses of Cai Prefecture would be particularly weakened and that the opportunity was right for an attack. Li Su reported his plan to the chancellor Pei Du, who had by this point been put in charge of the operations against Zhangyi, and Pei approved.
On November 27, 817, at dusk, Li Su launched the attack, from his then-base of Wencheng Fence (文成柵, in modern Zhumadian), without informing anyone other than Li You and Li Zhongyi what the intended target was. He had Li You and Li Zhongyi command the 3,000 "Tujiang" soldiers as first stage troops, with himself and the eunuch monitor of the army commanding 3,000 soldiers as the second stage troops and the officer Li Jincheng (李進誠) commanding 3,000 soldiers as the third stage troops. He attacked the village Zhangchai (張柴) and killed the Zhangyi soldiers stationed there, and then, with 500 soldiers requisitioned from Yicheng Circuit (義成, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) remaining there to block off potential aid troops from Langshan and Ding commanding 500 soldiers to destroy bridges between Cai Prefecture and Huiqu, he continued to advance. After the soldiers had dinner, he announced that the target was Cai Prefecture itself — drawing much alarm from the officers and causing the eunuch monitor to cry bitterly, "We have fallen into Li You's trap!" At that time, there was a heavy snowstorm, such that Li Su's banner was torn, and some of his soldiers and horses were freezing to death, but he ordered continuing march forward.
Just before dawn on November 28, Li Su's forces reached the walls of Cai Prefecture. Li You and Li Zhongyi led their soldiers in climbing up the walls, catching the wall defenders in their sleep and killing them. Li You and Li Zhongyi then entered the city and opened the gates to allow the rest of Li Su's forces in. Li Su took over Wu's headquarters and had the inner city, his mansion, where he was, surrounded. Believing that Wu's only hope was if the key Zhangyi commander Dong Chongzhi (董重質), who was in command of the forces at Huiqu, quickly advanced back to save him, he visited Dong's household and comforted Dong's family, sending Dong's son Dong Chuandao (董傳道) to Huiqu to summon him back. Dong Chongzhi immediately abandoned his troops and returned to Cai Prefecture to surrender to Li Su. Li Su had Li Jincheng attack the inner city, and by this point, the residents of Cai Prefecture were assisting Li Su's attack. On November 29, Wu surrendered, and Li Su arrested him and delivered him to Chang'an.
Several days later, Pei arrived with the Zhangyi soldiers at Huiqu, who surrendered after Wu's capture. Li Su waited by the road to be ready to pay proper respect to Pei by military ceremony. Pei initially, in humility, wanted to avoid having Li Su bow to him, but Li Su pointed out that it was proper for them to demonstrate the proper etiquette for the imperial army before the surrendered soldiers and people of Cai Prefecture. Pei thus agreed.
Li Su then returned to Wencheng Fence. His officers asked him the reasons why he was not displeased about the failure to capture Langshan, the decision not to capture Wufang, and the decision to march forward in the snowstorm. Li Su responded:
After the campaign against Wu Yuanji.
In the aftermaths of the campaign, Li Su's Tangsuideng Circuit was merged back into the circuit that it was split from — Shannan East Circuit (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) — and he was made the military governor of Shannan East. He was also created the Duke of Liang. At his urging, Emperor Xianzong, who had initially wanted to execute Dong Chongzhi, spared Dong but still exiled Dong to Chun Prefecture (春州, in modern Yangjiang, Guangdong) to serve as its census officer. When Li Su subsequently submitted a list of 150 officers who contributed to the victory, requesting that Emperor Xianzong promote them, Emperor Xianzong was displeased by the lengthy list, stating to Pei, "While Li Su accomplished an uncommonly great achievement, he recommended too many people. Based on this, then, imagine how many people Li Sheng and Hun Zhen could have recommended!" Emperor Xianzong thus did not act on Li Su's recommendations.
Soon thereafter, with Emperor Xianzong considering a campaign on the western border against Tufan, in summer 818, he made Li Su the military governor of Fengxiang (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and Longyou (隴右, then also headquartered in modern Baoji) Circuits. Before Li Su could head to Fengxiang, however, Wu Yuanji's ally Li Shidao the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), who had, in fear after Wu's defeat, initially offered to surrender three of Pinglu's 12 prectures to imperial control, reneged on his offer. Emperor Xianzong, in anger, announced a campaign against Pinglu. Li Su was thereafter swapped in his posting with his brother Li Yuan (李愿) the military governor of Wuning Circuit (武寧, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), which bordered Pinglu to the south, as well as the prefect of Wuning's capital Xu Prefecture (徐州). Once Li Su got to Xu Prefecture, he reorganized the troops into greater efficiency. At Li Su's request, Emperor Xianzong pardoned Dong and recalled him, and Li Su subsequently made Dong a commander in his army. Li Su subsequently engaged in 11 battles with Pinglu forces, prevailing each time. Around the new year 819, he captured the key Pinglu city of Jinxiang (金鄉, in modern Jining, Shandong), and thereafter continued to capture Pinglu cities. Li Shidao was thereafter killed by his own subordinate Liu Wu, who submitted to imperial authority.
While Li Su was still at Wuning, one of his subordinates recommended the physician Zheng Zhu to him, as he was often ill. Li Su's conditions improved after taking Zheng's medication, and he became closely associated with Zheng, such that Zheng became powerful over his staff members and were often interfering with governance. When the eunuch monitor Wang Shoucheng found the situation to be inappropriate and asked Li Su to remove Zheng from his staff, Li Su told him, "While Zheng Zhu is frivolous, he is talented. You should try to meet with him. If you really find him to be useless, I will remove him." Wang initially did not want to meet Zheng, but eventually agreed. After he did so, he was also pleased by Zheng's amusing speech, and therefore also became closely associated with Zheng. Zheng, not wanting others to know about how he first became associated with Li Su and Wang, subsequently falsely accused the officer who had initially recommended him, and Li Su executed the officer.
During Emperor Muzong's reign.
In spring 820, Emperor Xianzong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Muzong. Soon thereafter, Li Su was given the honorary chancellor title of "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事). Further, in anticipation of potential further actions against two other circuits governed "de facto" independently — Chengde (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) and Lulong (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing) — Emperor Muzong made Li Su the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi). Later that year, when Wang Chengzong the military governor of Chengde died, his brother Wang Chengyuan offered to return control of the circuit to the imperial government. Emperor Muzong, in response, moved Tian Hongzheng the military governor of Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) — itself having previously been semi-independent from imperial rule but which had submitted to imperial command during Tian Hongzheng's governance — to Chengde, Wang Chengyuan to Yicheng, Liu Wu from Yicheng to Zhaoyi, Li Su from Zhaoyi to Weibo, and Tian Hongzheng's son Tian Bu to Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Luoyang, Henan).
The Chengde soldiers, however, had long resented Tian Hongzheng, as during Emperor Xianzong's reign Chengde and Weibo forces had often battled each other. Initially, with Weibo soldiers accompanying Tian Hongzheng to Chengde and protecting him, they did not act, but as soon as Weibo soldiers returned to Weibo in summer 821, the Chengde officer Wang Tingcou rose in mutiny and killed Tian Hongzheng. Upon hearing of Tian Hongzheng's death, Li Su changed into mourning clothes, and he stated to his soldiers:
The soldiers all wept in sadness. Meanwhile, Niu Yuanyi (牛元翼) the prefect of Shen Prefecture (深州, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), was not willing to follow Wang. Li Su, hearing this, sent his sword and jade belt to Niu, sending a message to him: "My father had used this sword to accomplish great things. I have also used this sword to capture Cai Prefecture. Now I give it to you, Lord, and you should use it to destroy Wang Tingcou." Niu was touched, and showed the sword and belt to his soldiers and stated, "I am willing to die for the empire." Li Su was then preparing an attack against Wang in conjunction with Niu, but suddenly fell ill again. Emperor Muzong thus made Tian Bu the military governor of Weibo to succeed him. Li Su was given the title of advisor to the Crown Prince, and allowed to return to the eastern capital Luoyang to try to recover from illness. However, he died there in winter 821. He was buried with great honors.

Stephen Menheniott

Stephen Richard Menheniott (4 June 1957 – January 1976) was an 18-year-old English man with learning difficulties who was murdered by his father on the Isles of Scilly in 1976. This case was significant as not only was it a rare example of a murder on the islands, but it also called into question the way Stephen was dealt with by social services and led to questions in Parliament and an inquiry.
Family.
William Thomas (Tom) Menheniott was born in Cornwall on 26 February 1924. His mother died when he was three months old and his father was apparently blind, so he and his brother George, who was three years older, were brought up in a children's home administered by the Public Assistance Committee. The regime was harsh and corporal punishment was often employed. At the age of fourteen, George ran away and, after working on a farm for a while, enlisted in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry.
When he reached the age of fourteen, Tom also ran away and joined the Army, where he qualified as a motor mechanic. In the 1940s he got married and had two children. A girl was born on 18 January 1948 and was taken into care by Cornwall County Council in infancy after Tom had been convicted of neglect, for which he was sent to prison. She was never reunited with her parents and was later fostered and attended a special school for children with learning difficulties. A boy was born on 7 February 1949. He too was taken into care and died from muscular dystrophy at the age of seventeen.
In about 1950, Tom separated from his wife and moved in with a woman called Elizabeth. She used the surname Menheniott, although they were never married. They had six children together (the last of which died in infancy), although Elizabeth appears to have already had six children. A boy was born on 23 September 1950 and a girl on 14 July 1952. Both were taken into care by Cornwall County Council in 1953 and both Tom and Elizabeth were convicted and imprisoned for neglect. After their release they began to travel around the country. A second son was born in Kent on 7 January 1955 and was soon afterwards taken into care by Kent County Council due to the family having no suitable accommodation. Tom assaulted the NSPCC inspector who dealt with the case. A second daughter was born on 27 May 1956.
Birth and early years, 1957–1959.
Stephen was born in Redhill County Hospital, Surrey on 4 June 1957. His parents were at that time living in a caravan. The following year they became homeless, and on 13 January 1958 Stephen and his sister were taken into care by Surrey County Council and placed in a residential nursery at Epsom. At the end of January, the Menheniotts found alternative accommodation and their daughter was returned to them, but Stephen was not healthy and was kept in care. He was allowed home in August. His parents soon moved to Hailsham in East Sussex and four months later Stephen was admitted to hospital in Eastbourne in an undernourished condition. An NSPCC inspector described the conditions in which the Menheniotts lived as "deplorable". On 29 January 1959, the 19-month-old Stephen was taken into care direct from hospital by East Sussex County Council and placed in a residential nursery. Soon afterwards the Council assumed parental rights under Section 2 of the Children Act 1948, to the age of eighteen or until the resolution was rescinded.
In care, 1959–1968.
In December 1959, at the age of 2½, Stephen was fostered by a young couple and seemed to be happy and doing well. However, in January 1961 his foster mother became pregnant with her first child, and Stephen's behaviour became highly disturbed. On 18 December 1961 he was readmitted to the residential nursery and it was decided that, due to his behaviour and his now obvious learning difficulties ("retardation" as it was then described), all contact with his foster parents should be severed. In February 1964 he was transferred to a children's home. From January 1962, he often visited and was visited by two local ladies who had offered to "befriend" a child as "aunties", and they became very fond of each other. In 1964, Stephen began attending a special school, but it was determined that he was too intelligent for this school (his IQ was assessed at 89), and in January 1966 he was transferred to the remedial class of the local primary school. He remained at this school and living in the children's home until July 1968, when he was eleven. In 1966, he began to visit his older brother, who was living with a foster family in Kent, but these visits were difficult as the brother (in common with many other people) found him somewhat irritating.
The Isles of Scilly.
In 1962, Tom and Elizabeth Menheniott moved to a tied cottage (i.e. a cottage that comes with a job) in East Sussex and their youngest daughter was returned to them from the foster home in Hastings where she had spent the last eighteen months. In 1965, the family moved to the Isles of Scilly.
The Isles of Scilly are very isolated and had a population at that time of about 2,400. The islands had no social services, although there was a Social Services Committee. By informal arrangement, Cornwall County Council provided any services that the islands could not provide for themselves.
Tom obtained employment with a daffodil farmer, and a small tied cottage went with the job. It was situated in the lonely hamlet of Holy Vale, at the far side of the main island of St Mary's and rarely visited by locals. The hamlet consisted of only three cottages, one of which was empty and one let to holidaymakers in season, and a farm. Tom was not particularly popular on the island, but he became something of a local 'character' and was seen as useful because of his mechanical skills (which he sometimes practised without charge). An unkempt, powerfully built man, he was known for his temper and bad language, but was also capable of acts of kindness. He was good at his job, got on well with his employer, and had apparently stopped drinking (he had previously been known as a heavy drinker).
Return to family, 1968–1969.
Tom Menheniott had been asking for news of his children since 1966 and Stephen appeared to want to see his father (although he rarely mentioned his mother); and in 1967 the children's officer for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly wrote to East Sussex County Council suggesting that, as the family now seemed to be settled, a visit could be arranged. On 15 August 1967, Stephen and his social worker set off for the Isles of Scilly, where the social worker reported that Tom was "brusque", "belligerent" and "intimidating". Stephen stayed with his family for twelve days, then returned to East Sussex. He began to regularly correspond with them and visited again at Christmas 1967 and Easter 1968. The two children in the care of Cornwall and the brother in care in Kent (who had run away from his foster parents in February 1968 and made his own way to the Isles of Scilly) were now living with their parents under "home on trial" arrangements. No signs of ill-treatment were seen, and after he had stayed with his family over the 1968 summer holidays, Stephen was allowed to stay permanently. He went to the local school with his brother and sister, and at first he seemed happy. The children were apparently always well-dressed and well-fed.
In care again, 1969–1972.
However, things began to deteriorate. In April 1969, Stephen and his brother were caught stealing. In July 1969, the child care officer recorded that Stephen appeared to be frightened of his father and siblings. In September 1969, it was suggested that Elizabeth wished to leave her common law husband. In November 1969, Stephen confessed to the child care officer that he had probably been happier in care. He was also apparently being bullied by other children at school.
Things came to a head in November 1969, when the youngest daughter (who was thirteen) became pregnant and Tom was charged with incest. On 24 November 1969, all the children were removed and returned to the mainland. Tom was acquitted, but the pregnant daughter was still taken into care by the Isles of Scilly Council. The 15-year-old brother was found to have a fractured humerus and said that he had no wish to return to his family; he was returned to his foster home in Kent. Several of the children later admitted that they had had arms broken by Tom at one time or another, but were too frightened to report it at the time. Tom's relations with the other islanders deteriorated, as most of them seem to have believed that he was wrongly acquitted. Cornwall County Council proposed placing Stephen in a residential special school, but the educational psychologist who assessed him considered that this would be inappropriate as, although he was currently functioning at below average ability, he was of near average intelligence. Stephen himself expressed a desire to return to East Sussex and on 22 December 1969 his wishes were granted.
However, Stephen then expressed a desire to return to his family. He was living in an assessment centre and was isolated, finding it difficult to make friends and being bullied, although he was popular with adults. He was likeable and polite, although he had occasional aggressive outbursts, usually directed at inanimate objects. For some reason, his two "aunties" were not informed of his return to the county. He was transferred to the centre's long stay unit, but did not attend school. He continued to correspond regularly with his family and began to ask to visit. His mother, however, was now living on the mainland (and was never to return to Tom) and only the oldest sister had returned to live with her father. She and Tom expressed a desire for Stephen's return. The children's officer for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly disagreed, describing Tom as "an aggressive psychopath and a morally corrupt man". However, social workers in East Sussex decided that Stephen needed his family and he was allowed to visit between 24 December 1971 and 5 January 1972.
On 7 August 1972 he once again travelled to the Isles of Scilly, supposedly for a three-week visit. It was, however, obvious at this stage that he would not be expected to return to East Sussex. When the children's officer in Cornwall heard about this, she wrote to the director of social services of East Sussex expressing her deep disapproval and stating that it would be impossible for Cornwall Social Services to arrange any supervision due to the isolation of the location and the aggressive attitude of Tom Menheniott. East Sussex Social Services replied that they did not share her concern. Stephen was allowed to stay with his father and nobody from East Sussex Social Services ever visited him, despite the fact that East Sussex County Council had assumed parental rights until his eighteenth birthday. East Sussex closed their case file on Stephen. The family now consisted of Tom, his 20-year-old oldest daughter, her oldest child (she had two more children in the next two years), and the 17-year-old Stephen.
Last years in the Isles of Scilly, 1972–1976.
Stephen obtained employment as a shelf-stacker in a local supermarket, but was dismissed after about six months due to his poor personal hygiene. Shortly before this, the Council of the Isles reported to the children's officer that there seemed to be no problems. However, in April 1973 the youngest daughter and her boyfriend visited Holy Vale and Tom beat her up. Stephen was given employment by a flower farmer, but was reluctantly dismissed after it became obvious that he would never be able to work on his own. He may have later worked casually on the same farm as his father. Few people visited the increasingly squalid cottage and, apart from Tom, the Menheniotts were rarely seen around the island. When the community nurse visited to check up on the young children, she described Stephen as "looking like a frightened rabbit", but did not see any signs of physical injury. However, in October 1975 Stephen visited the island's dentist, a Mr Fairest, where it was found that three of his front teeth were broken beyond repair.
In 1976, Stephen disappeared. His family claimed that he had gone to the mainland to visit a girlfriend. However, the dentist, Mr Fairest, had been troubled by the injuries he had witnessed, and reported his concerns to the police. Some time later, Stephen's body was discovered buried in a shallow grave in California Field, near the cottage, with logs piled on top of it. It is likely that he died during the first week of 1976.
The trial.
Thomas Menheniott was charged with murder, four counts of grievous bodily harm, and preventing an inquest by burying the body. He admitted the last charge, but denied the other five, and was committed for trial at Bodmin Crown Court. The trial began before Mr Justice Willis on 6 December 1977.
The prosecutor, David Owen-Thomas QC, alleged that Tom beat his son over a period of years with high tension cables, scaffolding, a shovel, a broomstick, a fence post, and a potato tray. He also threw a knife and hot tea at him and punched him. He was tethered outside the cottage and not allowed to leave. He had five fractures on four ribs, one of which was fractured twice within days of his death. When he died his father put his body in his car and took him to California Field, before putting it in a wheelbarrow, covering it with a tarpaulin, and taking it to the grave he had already dug.
On 16 December 1977, the jury of ten men and two women took almost four hours to return a guilty verdict on the murder charge, but were discharged from returning verdicts on the GBH charges. Tom was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, plus five years to run concurrently for concealing the body. The judge criticised the people of the Isles of Scilly (with the notable exception of Mr Fairest, whom he praised) for failing to help Stephen, and also Cornwall and East Sussex County Councils for their lack of supervision, although it was accepted by the later inquiry that Cornwall had no legal obligation to provide services to the Isles of Scilly.
Inquiries.
On 20 December 1977, an internal inquiry in East Sussex County Council found that the council failed to properly supervise Stephen once he had gone to live with his father.
In January 1978, David Ennals, the Secretary of State for Social Services, instituted a departmental inquiry by Claris Jayne, Joan Acton and Jim Wheatley. This inquiry reported in September 1978. It met Elizabeth Menheniott, her other children, and Stephen's uncle, George Menheniott, now a chauffeur and gardener living in Hampshire, as well as members and employees of Cornwall and East Sussex County Councils and the Council of the Isles of Scilly, employees of the health authorities involved, and officers of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary.
The inquiry found that:

Bulgarian-Romanian relations are foreign relations between Bulgaria and Romania. Bulgaria has an embassy in Bucharest. Romania has an embassy in Sofia and 2 honorary consulates (in Burgas and Silistra). There are between 8,000 and 30,000 Bulgarians who are living in Romania and around 11,000 Romanians who are living in Bulgaria.
Both countries are full members of NATO and of the European Union. Both countries share 608 km of common borders, mostly along the Danube.
Bulgarian relations with Romania featured regular official visits by the two presidents. Romanian-Bulgarian relations are developing "very intensively" because of EU accession, since Romania and Bulgaria both joined the European Union in 2007. Romania and Bulgaria have never had any serious conflicts, other than a territorial dispute over the Dobruja region in 1913-1940, ended with the Craiova Treaty and now largely forgotten. There are close relations between Ruse and Giurgiu which have one of the two bridges on the Danube in the section shared by the two countries.

Sts Simon and Jude Catholic Church, Streatham Hill

Sts Simon and Jude serves the parish of Streatham Hill
History.
The Catholic Community of Streatham Hill was founded in 1904 when Frances Elizabeth Ellis of Clapham Park gave Bishop Peter Amigo, fourth Bishop of Southwark, funds to build 12 churches in honour of the 12 apostles. Miss Ellis and her sister had bought the land from the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company. As in all the Ellis foundations, at Sts Simon and Jude there is a monthly Mass 'For all who have ever worshipped in this church'.
The church, designed by Clement Jackson, was opened in 1905 as the Tulse Hill Mission and Father (later Canon) Rory Fletcher, a former surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital, was appointed as the first Mission Priest.
The site of the Church was a cattle pond fed by a stream, which still runs underneath the church. Almost immediately, this stream was the cause of structural weakness, which has continued to give subsidence problems over the years. In the entrance hall to the sacristy, you can see plans for additions to the church which were never built for this reason.
By 1985, the whole property was suffering from subsidence, and daylight could be seen through many of the cracks in the walls of the church and house. An extensive and expensive programme of underpinning and repair to the whole structure had to be undertaken as a matter of urgency. At the same time, it was decided to start decorating the interior. The sanctuary was raised up one metre and a new altar of Ancaster stone backed by an oak dossal and damask hangings was installed. Cheshire sandstone was used for the Tabernacle pillar and the pulpit base. The great Cross and two hand-carved angels which came originally from Poland were gilded. A new Ahlborn electric organ was installed at the side of the sanctuary: it has an extra computer which reads and stores what the organist is playing, which means that it can play itself when the organist is not present, a great help when there are multiple Masses on one day.  A programme to fill the windows with stained glass was undertaken by the artist Andrew Taylor of Devizes in a mediaeval style with the most recent addition of a central widow on the front of the Church with the image of the Divine Mercy. This is lit in the evening from inside the Church for the benefit of the local people. This window was designed and manufactured by Mrs Susan Ashworth of Blackheath, London. It was installed in 2004 to celebrate the Centenary of the building of the Church.

Tuhin Sinha

Tuhin A. Sinha is an Indian author. He is known for the novels "The Edge Of Power", "The Edge Of Desire", "Of Love and Politics", "That Thing Called Love" and "22 Yards".
Early life.
Tuhin was born and brought up in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. He completed his schooling at Loyola School, and obtained a BCom (H) from the Hindu College, University of Delhi and post-graduate diploma in advertising and communications management from the National Institute of Advertising, New Delhi. 
Career.
Tuhin's latest novel, "The Edge Of Power", a sequel to his previous bestseller, "The Edge of Desire", has being published by Hachette India and is receiving a tremendous positive response from readers across the country. In addition to enthusiastic participation at his book launches, The Edge Of Power has received positive reviews and feedback from a number of book bloggers. Activities done through online and social media presences continue to generate excitement among readers.
Prior to The Edge Of Power, Tuhin has written the following four bestsellers:
Tuhin's first novel, "That Thing Called Love", was released on 25 September 2006. It is set against the backdrop of Mumbai monsoons and explores relationships in the contemporary urban set up of the city, in the phase of changing moralities. The book has sold over 1,00,000 (100,000) copies.
"The Captain" was his second novel and is a chronicle of a fictitious Indian cricket team captain's journey through the fickleness of life and the cricket world. The novel was originally published as "22 Yards" in August 2008 by Westland. Later Rupa Publishers re-published it in 2011 with a new name.
Both "That Thing Called Love" and "The Captain" have been brought out in the Hindi and Bengali languages as well. Regional language versions were published by Diamond Books, Delhi. The Marathi version of "That Thing Called Love" is being published by Mehta Publishing House, Pune.
Tuhin's third English novel, "Of Love and Politics", published by Hachette India, was released on 2 July 2010 at IHC, New Delhi, by renowned politician Ravi Shankar Prasad and TV journalist Bhupendra Chaubey. The Delhi event was followed by high-profile events in Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Pune. The book is known for its peculiar interplay between personal relationships and political alliances which are present throughout the book.
Tuhin's fourth novel, "The Edge of Desire" was published by Hachette India in May 2012. Loosely inspired by the "Mahabharat", the book narrates the fight back of a rape victim who goes on to become a top political leader of the country. The lead characters of the book, Shruti Ranjan and Sharad Malviya became immensely popular and the book made it to various best-sellers' lists in the first few months after its release. The book's massive success prompted Tuhin to attempt its sequel. 
Apart from writing novels, Tuhin has contributed guest columns to India's leading print media publications. They include "The Times of India", "DNA" and "Grazia".
Tuhin has also scripted several popular TV shows. He has co-written one of the most popular soaps on Star Plus, "Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai" between November, 2011 and April 2012. Some of the other serials on which he has worked include "Pyar Ki Kashti Mein" (Star One, 2004-5), "Koi Dil Mein hai" (Sony, 2004-5), "Dekho Magar Pyar se" (Star, 2005) and "Waqt Batayega Kaun Apna Kaun Paraya" (Sony, 2008) and "Afsar Bitiya " (Zee, 2012). A TV film, "Phir Se", based on a story written by Tuhin and premiered on Sahara One, won the RAPA Award for the best telefilm in 2005.
In addition to these, Tuhin has acted in a couple of series in the early stages of his career. He has also played the part of the protagonist, Mayank in the promo and music video shot around his first novel, "That Thing Called Love". This promo was directed by S. Manasvi and featured famous TV actor, Akshay Anand.
Personal style.
Tuhin is among the most prolific young Indian writers today. While "That Thing Called Love" was a story about the dark side of relationships, set in a Mumbai monsoon, "22 Yards" can aptly be called a “cricket thriller”, written in first person by a fictitious Indian captain.
With "Of Love and Politics", Tuhin has attempted an unusual story of relationships involving three Indian politicians, subscribing to different ideologies.

Keep Up the Great work! – Aruna Shankar
It's powerful and it's engrossing – Samarpita
An extraordinarily glowingly delved into and finely written paperback – Kalyan Panja
The Edge Of Desire
Shruti Ranjan is an apt representation of today's Indian woman, living on the cusp of modernity and tradition and dealing with the multitude of problems which come with this...In many ways, Shruti represents the formidable modern day Draupadi - The Asian Age
The Edge of Desire is worth a read to understand the quirks of fate, the machinations of politics and what a combustible combination the two can make. - The Hindu
The book's immensely pacy - mirroring exactly the frenetic developments in Indian politics where a split second can transform people's lives. Sinha's made good use of real-life events as markers in Shruti's political and personal life. The Mahabharata metaphor is thought-provoking and Sinha's also done a fair job of showing the different, often clashing sides of his characters' personalities - ibnlive.com
The book has an interesting plot, considering the immensely political times we live in…Sinha covers a wide swathe, keeping his narrative interesting while portraying Shruti's 'it's complicated' status, be it her rocky personal or professional life - rediff.com
Of Love And Politics
Indeed, in today's age of monosyllabic phrases and grammatically horrifying SMS-lingo, it is commendable to have a writer like Sinha who can so adeptly weave Shakespearean phrases like 'phlegmatic propensities' and 'puerile denials' with Shashi Tharoor-esque aplomb in his work - The Hindu
The book throws up well-researched and lesser-known trivia about Indian political history that is very illuminating. Tuhin represents a breed of young Indian authors who are conscious of their roots and who keep an eye on their political surroundings. - Deccan Herald
One of the most critical areas which the books delves into and which I liked very much is the connect between one's personal beliefs and his/her political ideology..the book celebrates democracy - Ravi Shankar Prasad, Senior Politician
...very interesting characters and some brilliant passages - Rimi Chatterjee, Author
The best part about the book is that it provides a distinct perspective on almost every important political event of the last century - Piyush Jha, Filmmaker
Politics makes strange bed-fellows and this book aptly proves it - Abhijit Bhaduri, Author
Thought provoking, easy flowing yet deep. Not only does it raise questions about the flaws in our multi-party democracy but also makes an attempt at offering solutions - Gul Panag, Actress
That Thing Called Love
Set at a good pace, debutant novelist and scriptwriter Tuhin A. Sinha weaves a contemporary story of a bunch of well-etched out characters' exploring expectations, disillusionments and fragility in relationships." - Indiantelevision.com
"… an urban metropolitan reader may easily be able to relate to the dynamics governing the rising complexities in relationships."- Shaaditimes.com
"..the book touches several social issues and deals with them in a manner that has hitherto not been dealt with before." - Screen
"A subject, currently explored in films, coupled with flowing language and generous use of the first person, makes this book an exciting read." - Afternoon Dispatch and Courier, Mumbai
"A journey of discovery through disparate spectrums, Tuhin waxes eloquent on the choices that lie before the typical urban Indian male and in an odd way strikes a chord that is unmistakable."- The Sunday Indian
The Captain (formerly 22 Yards)
"Setting the cats among the pigeons, 22 Yards steers dangerously close to uncomfortable facts surrounding cricket today" - Financial Express
"The book is the first of its kind- it embarks on a course that is based on some real life incidents in Indian cricket." - The Hindu
"The plot is extremely interesting and would find favour with all cricket lovers. The writing is swift and lucid." - The Statesman
"A breezy non-stop read with some excellent passages which bring out the issues that confront modern day cricket." - Charu Sharma, cricket analyst
"All the passion and pain of cricket, all the glory and gloom; the need to be a loner and share a field with twenty-one other loners; the swing and spin of success, greed and lust..The Captain is alive with that feeling, that comprehension." - Tom Alter, actor and cricket expert
"Of Management and Politics" talk series.
With a view to educate the youth and understand their viewpoint on contemporary national and social issues, Tuhin has initiated a talk series called "Of Management and Politics". The first two sessions took place at XLRI, Jamsedpur and the Symbiosis Institute of Management and Human Resource Management, Hinjewadi, Pune. The driving objective of the initiative is to bring a significant change in the common perceptions towards politics and to encourage the youth to participate more in the political system of India. In the next few years, Tuhin intends to take this series to every part of the country.
"Love Thy Leader" series.
In March–April 2010, Tuhin wrote a controversial four-part series of columns called "Love Thy Leader" for Times Life of "The Times of India". Each column dwelt upon a romance, involving a key political figure. The column disputed existing notions and sought to provide a differential perspective about facts that have often remained clouded in history. While the first column delved into the power play in the Sarkozy-Bruni romance, the second questioned the veracity of the Akbar-Jodha hyphenation, the third probed the possible political implications of the Nehru-Edwina romance, while the last one dwelt upon the bond between Hitler and Eva Braun, which still remains shrouded in mystery.
Personal life.
Tuhin lives in Mumbai with his wife Ramyani and one year old son, Neev.

Doxmart

Doxmart (previously Scriptor) was a UK based, international document sharing portal with its HQ based in Leicester, England. It also had offices in Italy and Germany. The company was formed in 2007 and was founded by two people: Clive Mendes and Vito Fortunato . 
History.
The idea of a document sharing website was initially conceived by Clive Mendes, after he lent his friend Vito Fortunato a negotiations template that he perfected over 20 years in business. Mendes decided to try to market his template. He devised the concept of Doxmart and took the idea back to Fortunato, who had a background in telecommunications and consumer electronics. 
Initial research had shown that while document sharing sites already existed, there was no centralized location for these types of sites. Existing sites were also generally limited to pure text-based content. Doxmart decided to also implement audio and video features in addition to plain text.
The company is no longer trading.
Service.
Doxmart was developed as a two tier web application. It allows the user to both buy and sell documents in a system similar to eBay's. It uses a commission-based system with a one time hosting payment for sellers. Sellers must pay a small fee to upload their document so the company can recoup the cost of keeping quality high. T

Jean Hindmarsh

Jean Hindmarsh (born 1932) is a retired English singer and actress. She is best known as a principal soprano with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in the 1950s and 1960s.
Biography.
HIndmarsh was born in Leeds and educated at Lawnswood High School. There, she was prominent in the school's musical and theatrical productions, including "Merrie England" in 1950, in which she played Sir Walter Raleigh. Hindmarsh gained her teaching diploma (ARMCM) from the Royal College of Music in Manchester and then continued to study opera for an additional 18 months. She played the lead in two college productions and sang in concerts and oratorios. Hindmarsh was the runner-up in the first Kathleen Ferrier Competition in 1955 and won the Blackpool heat against 97 competitors. A representative from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company heard her performance and invited her to audition. 
Hindmarsh was engaged by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in March 1956 as principal soprano. Over the next four years, she played the title role in "Princess Ida", Mabel in "The Pirates of Penzance", Elsie Maynard in "The Yeomen of the Guard", Gianetta in "The Gondoliers" and Josephine in "HMS Pinafore", soon adding the small role of Lady Ella in "Patience". In 1959, she began instead to play the title role in "Patience". Hindmarsh married in 1960 and left the D'Oyly Carte organisation when she was expecting her first child. She rejoined the Company as a guest artist in her old roles for seasons in 1961–62, 1962–63, in the spring of 1963, 1963–64, and in the spring of 1969. These included two London seasons, one provincial tour and one American tour. In reviewing "Princess Ida" in 1961, "The Times" wrote that, in the title role, "Hindmarsh charms, amuses and... moves the audience". That paper commented on a 1962 performance of "The Gondoliers": "Outstanding among last night's cast was Miss Jean Hindmarsh, a winning Giannetta both in appearance and voice."
Hindmarsh sings the lead soprano roles on four D'Oyly Carte recordings: Yum-Yum in "The Mikado" (1957), Mabel in "Pirates" (1957), Josephine in "Pinafore" (1960), and Rose Maybud in "Ruddigore" (1962), even though she never played Yum-Yum or Rose with the company. Of the 1957 "Pirates", reviewer Mel Moratti wrote, "The highlights must be the pairing of Thomas Round and Jean Hindmarsh as Frederic and Mabel. Their solos and duets are most delightful". "The Rough Guide to Opera" comments that she "is a uniquely charming Josephine" in "Pinafore".
In recent years, Hindmarsh has performed and given talks at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival. At the Festival, in 1999, Hindmarsh and baritone Michael Rayner gave the world premiere performance of "Reflect, my child", a song cut from "H.M.S. Pinafore" before the opera opened in 1878 and reconstructed in 1998.

Rona Kenan

Rona (Aharona) Rachel Kenan (, born 26 July 1979) is an Israeli singer/songwriter.
Biography.
Kenan was born on 26 July 1979. Her father is the late Amos Kenan and her mother is the scholar Nurith Gertz. She was attracted to music at a young age and learned to play the guitar. She graduated from the theater program at Thelma Yellin High School of the Arts, but preferred a musical career. At the age of eighteen she was considered a "discovery". She has cited the Beatles (particularly the song Blackbird), Leah Goldberg, The Pixies, Pina Bausch and Thelma Yellin as early influences.
In 1997 she participated in a song festival called Next, organized by musician Eran Tzur, in which she recomposed and performed songs by poetess Yona Wallach. She also performed in an evening commemorating Inbal Perlmutter, a young poets' event, and an evening of Leah Goldberg's poetry. She played with several Israeli musicians, including Tal Gordon, Dana Berger and Asi Levi. In 1999 she and Gordon became a duo and recorded an album titled "I Didn't Want It to End: Tal Gordon Hosting Rona Kenan". Kenan co-composed four of the album's songs. The album tour went on until late 2000. In 2001 she started touring solo with a show which included two instrument players beside her. She sang and promoted four songs that came out as a single. She sang mostly in English.
In 2002, she kept collecting material for her debut album and started working hard with Izhar Ashdot as producer. In 2003, she began appearing with her trio in Tel Aviv, along with multi-instrumentalist Adam Scheflan and drummer Omri Hanegbi. She released three songs from the album: "Transparent Love", "To Live Right" and "Flood". In 2004, she released her debut, "Breathing Down to Zero". The album included eleven original tracks in both Hebrew and English, a cover version of a Yaakov Orland song, and an instrumental track titled "Thirst and Hunger". The album featured guest appearances by Maya Dunietz, Shlomi Shaban and Berry Sakharof. She said it was a challenge to write in her native language. After the album's release, she entered a state of deep depression. Her health deteriorated and she had to cancel shows. Taking Ashdot's advice, she moved back with her parents to recover. They decided not to share what she was going through with almost anyone.
She wrote the music for several of Israeli films and television series, including "The Cemetery Club", a documentary film directed by Tali Shemesh. In 2006 she released the first single from her second album, the title song "Through Foreign Eyes", and in early 2007 the second single from that album "The Last Time", came out. The album came out in February. She wrote all ten songs on the album, including a duet with Gidi Gov, "Strange Dance of the Heart". In 2008 she and Yoni Rechter performed renditions of two poems by author David Grossman - "End", for which Kenan wrote the music, and "At a Coffee Shop", which Rechter composed - at an afternoon honoring Grossman's latest novel at Holon's Mediatech Center. She also performed in London on a boat on the Thames, re-enactment of a Maapilim boat circa 1946, during the British Mandate of Palestine. In 2009 she released her third album, "Shirim Leyoel" ("Songs for Yoel"), a concept album inspired by her father's life story. In January 2014 three singles from an album named "Af Al Pil" were released, Kenan participating in two of them. In "Ha'Parpar Ve'Ha'Zahal" she sings a duet with Omer Klein whilst in "Ani Ve'Atsmi" she's a solo vocalist. The album was composed by Shahar Barbash and translated to Hebrew from Yiddish by Benny Mer.
In 2005 she became a "chosen artist" of the Israel Cultural Excellence Foundation. She is openly gay and is considered an icon in the gay and lesbian community in Israel. In 2007 she was photographed for the Israeli fashion company Comme Il Faut.

P. Cameron DeVore

P. Cameron DeVore (April 25, 1932 – October 26, 2008) was an American attorney who was an expert in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution who specialized in representing news companies in cases that involved issues of freedom of the press.
DeVore was born in Great Falls, Montana on April 25, 1932. His father was a newspaperman who was the editor of the "Great Falls Tribune" and the "Montana Farmer". He grew up in Spokane, Washington. DeVore studied at Yale University, University of Cambridge and Harvard Law School, where he received his law degree in 1961. After graduating from law school, he moved to Seattle, Washington and joined the firm of Wright, Simon, Todd & Schmechel (now known as Davis Wright Tremaine) where he developed a practice focusing on First Amendment issues.
Together with Robert D. Sack, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, he coauthored the 1998 book "Advertising and Commercial Speech: A First Amendment Guide".
First Amendment cases in which he was involved included "Auvil v. CBS 60 Minutes", in which Washington State apple growers claimed that a February 26, 1989 broadcast of the investigative television newsmagazine "60 Minutes" had exaggerated the potential dangers of the pesticide Daminozide and its health risks, especially in children. He also participated in "Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association v. United States", which challenged restrictions on casino advertising and challenged the extent to which the government can regulate the media. His brief in "Cable News Network v. Berger", which involved media participation in ride-alongs, argued that "media access to many vital law enforcement activities will cease" if the court found against the practice.
"The Seattle Times" was a client for 30 years. DeVore worked with the paper to vet news articles for the paper, helping it to find ways to publish articles that might have exposed the newspaper to legal action. Former managing editor Alex MacLeod credited DeVore with helping in three of the Pulitzer Prizes won by the paper, noting that "we published stories that were above reproach" even though "there was considerable risk to the paper in terms of our reputation or just plain legal jeopardy" in all of these articles.
DeVore died at age 76 on October 26, 2008 at his computer in his home on Lopez Island in Washington. A cause of death had not been determined, though it was apparently of a heart attack. In a self-written obituary, DeVore described his love of fly fishing and claimed in advance to have died of "a surfeit of pâté de foie gras ice cream smothered in huckleberries."

S'bu Ndebele

Sibusiso Joel "S'bu" Ndebele (born 17 October 1948, Rorke's Drift, KwaZulu-Natal), is the Minister of Correctional Services in the Cabinet of South Africa. He has been on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the African National Congress (ANC) since 1997, and was the Provincial Chair of the ANC from 1998 to 2008.
From 1994 to 2004 he was the MEC for Transport in the government of KwaZulu-Natal province. From 2004 to 2009 he was the Premier of the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal. From 2009 to 2012 he was the national Minister of Transport.
Studies.
He attended primary school at Makhaseneni, near Melmoth, and matriculated from Eshowe Teachers’ Training and High School in Eshowe.
He obtained a degree in library science from the University of Zululand in 1972, a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Politics and African Politics from the University of South Africa in 1983, and an honours degree in Development Administration and Politics in 1985.
Early politics.
He was publicity secretary of the South African Students Organisation at the University of Zululand (1972). Shortly thereafter, in 1974, he joined the African National Congress underground and went into exile in Swaziland. He was arrested for ANC activities in May 1976 and was sentenced to ten years on Robben Island in June 1977.
Criticism.
Recently he has been heavily criticised for offering 16 500 hectares of land to the Dubai-based company Ruwaad Holdngs to build a massive themepark named 'Zulu World'. This will result in the forced eviction of around 10 000 families from the eMacambini clan. The affected community has vowed to resist the evictions and has accused Ndebele of "selling" them to "a new kind of colonialism." On the 4th of December 2008, the eMacambini community blockaded the N2 and R102 freeways to protest S'bu Ndebele's non-reply to their memorandum handed over in a previous march. 
On 16 May 2009, shortly after accepting the position of Minister of Transport, Ndebele received a R1,1-million Mercedes Benz S500 from the Vukuzakhe group of 'emerging contractors', who had received contracts worth more than R400-million in the department. Opposition parties have claimed that the gift could be a conflict of interest and that the Mercedes should be returned. Ndebele explained that he received the gift unannounced, long after he had ceased being MEC for transport, and denies any conflict of interest.
Toll Roads.
There is not enough money available to fix roads, so more toll gates will probably have to be built on national roads, Transport Minister Sbu Ndebele said in a report on Thursday. More than 4 100 km of roads - or 32 percent of the national road network - are in such a bad state that they only have a "structural life span" of five years left.
It would cost more than R35-billion to fix these roads before 2014, Ndebele said in Parliament, according to Beeld newspaper.
But his department has only R16,8-billion available to do this.
Departmental Corruption Allegations.
The North West government said on Wednesday it had been hit by a multimillion-rand scandal related to road projects that might have been improperly and fraudulently awarded.
"I can confirm that a number of contracts issued by the department for several road projects in the province may have been improperly and fraudulently awarded," said Transport MEC Mahlakeng Mahlakeng in a statement.
He said it was estimated that more than R1.5 billion allocated for road capital projects over the next three years - the medium term expenditure framework - had already been committed.
Within three months of the current financial year, 2009/10, the roads directorate had already spent its entire capital project budget, he said. Its budget allocation for the year was R525 million.
He said the information had emerged from an audit by PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The government was committed to getting the money back.
Further details would be released once the government had cleared the legal implications of doing so.
Millions of rands' worth of contracts had been issued by the department "without following procedure as stipulated by the Public Finance Management Act (PMFA)".
The government would give the audit report to the police's Hawks and the Asset Forfeiture Unit to investigate. - credit Sapa

<doc id="20069858" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20069858" title="Roots of Empathy">
Roots of Empathy

Roots of Empathy is a classroom program that claims to have dramatic effect in reducing levels of aggression among schoolchildren by raising social/emotional competence and increasing empathy. The program reaches elementary schoolchildren from Kindergarten to Grade 8. In Canada, the program is delivered in English and French and reaches rural, urban, and remote communities including Aboriginal communities. Roots of Empathy is also delivered in New Zealand, the United States and the Isle of Man.
Origins.
The Roots of Empathy began in 1996 when Mary Gordon, child advocate and parenting expert, started the program with 150 kids in Toronto, Canada. Her goal was to help create a society where people were kind to one another and thought it would be best to start with children who are just developing their social skills. Since 1996, the Roots of Empathy program has surpassed many milestones and affected over 500,000 children directly and countless children indirectly.
Mission and goals.
The mission of the website according to its website:
“…to build caring, peaceful, and civil societies through the development of empathy in children and adults.”
Method.
The idea of Roots of Empathy is very basic. Children will learn based on observation and interaction with their classmates and a “teacher.” The “teacher” is an infant, ranging from two months to four months at the beginning of the school year. The infant visits a classroom of elementary school children accompanied by a Roots of Empathy facilitator and the infant’s mother. Through the course of the school year, the children are able to witness the baby grow and change. Further, the students are able to observe several different emotions conveyed by the baby that they might not recognize as easily in children their own age. For example, the baby may start crying and the facilitator will ask the children for a reason as to why the baby is crying. From this observation, the students will understand what type of different actions upset the baby and may then relate these actions to future situations when they see that someone else is upset. In short, it develops their skills to recognize and investigate emotions; it makes them more aware of others around them and their emotions. Another tactic that helps the children learn is that they watch the loving relationship between the parent and the baby (said to be the “ideal model of empathy”). The students witness how the parent meets the baby’s needs.
These visits take place an average of nine times a year per classroom. In addition to the parent-infant visits, the facilitator will stop by the classroom before or after each visit to reinforce the newly observed concepts. In the 2009–2010 school year, there were 1,867 classrooms participating in the program.
Concepts taught.
Emotional literacy.
The idea of emotional literacy involves allowing the students to watch the infant and draw conclusions on the baby’s emotions. The students are guided through the exercise by the facilitator asking a variety of questions regarding reasons why the baby may be reacting the way it is. These exercises are believed to help students better understand one another and in turn cause them to be kinder to one another.
Perspective-taking.
The perspective-taking section teaches students to listen to one another’s opinions. This leads to students being more accepting of one another because they are able to better understand someone by listening to the person’s opinion.
Neuroscience.
The neuroscience concept is a small section that leads into the section of the development of an infant. In general, this simply helps the children understand that for brains to develop, they need to be cared for with attention and love.
Temperament.
When learning about temperament, students see what type of temperament their classroom baby has. The facilitator emphasizes that each baby is different and unique. This is then related to how each student is also unique; hence, each student is taught to respect and understand one another’s differences.
Attachment.
The concept of attachment is meant to show students the most long-lasting bond that exists; that of a parent and a child. The children are able to watch the development of the relationship between the parent and the baby throughout the year during the nine visits. This idea demonstrates the importance of loving relationships.
Inclusion.
Along with temperament, the concept of inclusion aids students in appreciating one another’s uniqueness, beliefs, opinions and contributions. This idea is taught through open discussion among the students. The students are further shown the unfairness of exclusion. They become sympathetic and begin to advocate for one another, thus reducing bullying.
Violence prevention.
Violence prevention is taught hand in hand with a few of the other aforementioned topics. By teaching students to be kind to each other and to stand up for one another, violence will be reduced. Therefore, with the help of the facilitator, students learn about how to stop violence through discussions.
Participatory democracy.
Participatory democracy is taught in the classroom by encouraging students to ask questions and to listen to one another. This teaches them that everyone’s opinion is important and to make sure one always voices his/her opinion in an appropriate manner.
Teen pregnancy prevention.
Life skills such as teen pregnancy prevention are taught by demonstrating the needs an infant requires. One exercise involves students recording their sleep habits for a week and then coming back to class and comparing it with the parent’s sleeping pattern. The children then discuss these demands in class.
Infant safety and development.
Infant safety and development is taught to help students understand how fragile babies are and how much care must be taken around them. They are made aware of SIDS, Shaken Baby Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder as well as first- and second-hand smoke. These dangers are emphasized when children learn about how fragile and important infant development is.
Research and evaluation.
The Roots of Empathy program effectiveness has been evaluated nine different times by third-party independent reviewers. Overall, the results were positive. The results showed that participating students demonstrated several qualities including an increase in social knowledge, a decrease in aggression, an increase in sharing/inclusive/helping behaviour, and an increase in emotional perception. These effects appeared to be lasting. As previously mentioned, there had also been a decrease in bullying among the students who have participated in the program. 
Growth.
As a result of the positive evaluations, the Roots of Empathy program began to gain both momentum and recognition throughout Canada. The program began to spread from the Canadian province of Ontario to Alberta and New Brunswick. As a result of the expansion, the program was translated into French to correspond to Canada’s French provinces. Currently, six out of the ten Canadian provinces participate in the Roots of Empathy program. The program was so successful in Canada it spread to the United States in Seattle, Washington, and to the country of New Zealand in 2007. It continued to spread to Northern Ireland, Ireland, and Scotland. Germany is also currently working on launching the program.
Recognition.
In 2008, the Canadian Assembly of First Nations passed a resolution to endorse the Roots of Empathy program. This resolution further helped the program expand to reach Aboriginal tribes in Canada as well as other indigenous people around the world.
Founder.
Mary Gordon is the President and Founder of Roots of Empathy. She has received several recognitions including being appointed a Canadian Ashoka Fellow and conversed with the Dalai Lama in person on two separate occasions. She is also recognized as a best author for her book "Roots of Empathy: Changing the World Child by Child", which made a Top 100 books list and has been published in both the United States and South Korea.

MAN SL202

The MAN SL202 was a single-decker bus chassis built by MAN Nutzfahrzeuge from the mid-1980s, through to 1995, mainly used in Australia, Germany and New Zealand. Much of the design was used in the American version of the SL202, the MAN Americana SL40-102.
The SL202 came with a wide choice of transmissions, from three- and four-speed Renk Doromat automatic transmissions, to three- and four-speed Voith DIWA transmissions, to four- and five-speed ZF Ecomat 4HP500 or 5HP500 transmissions. One to date has been retro-fitted with an Allison World Series B300R4 transmission, creating a largely noticeable increase in performance against similar examples with the three-speed Voith DIWA transmission.
The internal combustion engines used in the SL202 were replaced around 1990, from older, smaller, 2566 series engines to newer, larger, 2866 series engines. The majority of pre-1990 SL202s have a D2566UH engine, developing about of torque at 1,400 rpm. These D2566 engines have a capacity of and max out at 2,200 rpm. This same engine was used for the SL200 and is similar in design to that of the OM407h engine used in the Mercedes-Benz O305.
Post-1990 SL202s have the D2866 engine, with higher power and torque figures. These engines have a capacity of and maximum output at 2,200 rpm, the design is similar to the OM447h engine of the Mercedes-Benz O405.
The SL202 was replaced by the MAN NL202.

Henry F. Dimock

Henry F. Dimock (March 28, 1842 – April 10, 1911) was a lawyer in New York City who was closely associated with the Whitney family business interests.
Dimock was born in South Coventry, Connecticut, the son of Timothy and Laura F. (Booth) Dimock. The family were descended from Thomas Dimock, who came from England to Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1637, and later settled in Barnstable, Massachusetts. Henry Dimock was a distant cousin of Ira Dimock (1827-1917), silk manufacturer, and Dr. Susan Dimock (1847-1875), early female physician who perished in the wreck of the "SS Schiller" in the Scilly Islands.
He was graduated from Yale University in 1863, where he was a member of Skull and Bones, and from Harvard Law School in 1865. In the latter year he commenced the practice of law in New York City. 
He married Susan Collins Whitney, whose siblings included Henry Melville Whitney, industrialist; William Collins Whitney, financier and Secretary of the Navy: and Lucy Collins "Lily" Whitney, wife of banker Charles T. Barney. They resided in New York City at 25 60th Street, corner of Madison Avenue, and also had a summer home at Bar Harbor, Maine. Henry and Susan Dimock were the parents of a daughter, Susan M. Dimock, whose marriage to Cary Talcott Hutchinson was solemnized at the Dimock residence on April 30, 1901. 
From 1875 until 1881 he was dock commissioner for the Port of New York. In 1875 Governor Samuel J. Tilden appointed Dimock to a committee to devise plans for the improvement of city government in the state. It was in this capacity that he took part in a debate on municipal finance reform in October 1877. In May 1881 he declined reappointment as dock commissioner by Mayor William R. Grace.
Dimock became interested in the Metropolitan Steamship Company, serving as the line's New York agent. He was also a director and a large shareholder, and in 1884 the company honored him by naming its new 2,625-ton steamer "H.F. Dimock".
In 1890 Dimock joined William C. Whitney, Charles T. Barney, W.E.D. Stokes, Francis W. Jenks, and others in forming the New York Loan and Improvement Company. He served on the board of directors of this concern, which was responsible for the development of the Washington Heights section of New York City. 
While on her customary voyage from New York to Boston when on July 24, 1892, in the Vinyard Sound the "H.F. Dimock" collided with William K. Vanderbilt's yacht, the "Alva", sinking her. Captain Morrison of the "Alva" filed suit against the "H.F. Dimock", but both the United States District Court for Massachusetts and the United States Supreme Court ruled against him.
Dimock joined Henry Melville Whitney in establishing the Dominion Coal Company Ltd. in 1893 and the Dominion Iron and Steel Company Ltd. in 1899 to exploit the mineral resources of the Sydney district of Cape Breton Island. Dimock served on the boards of both companies.
He was also a director of the McCall Ferry Power Company, Boston & Maine Railroad, Knickerbocker Trust Company, and the Metropolitan Steamship Company. Dimock was a member of the Society of Mayflower Descendants and of the University, Manhattan, Metropolitan, Down Town, Barnard, Lawyers, and Democratic clubs of New York City. He was also holder of box 19 at the Metropolitan Opera.
Dimock was elected a director of the Yale Corporation, the governing body of Yale University, in 1899 and reelected in 1905. His name had already been placed in nomination for another term when he suffered a heart attack on March 4, 1911. He suffered a paralytic stroke that affected his right side on April 1. After two days in a coma, he died at his residence on April 10, 1911.
Some five years after his death, the site of his home at Madison Avenue and 60th Street was leased to the Guaranty Trust Company for the construction of a new office building.

Special relativity (alternative formulations)

As formulated by Albert Einstein in 1905, the theory of special relativity was based on two main postulates:
There have been various alternative formulations of special relativity over the years. Some of these formulations are equivalent to the original formulation whereas others result in modifications.
"Single postulate" approaches.
"Equivalent to the original ? Yes."
According to some references, the theory of special relativity can be derived from a single postulate: the principle of relativity. This claim can be misleading because actually these formulations rely on various unsaid assumptions such as isotropy and homogeneity of space. The question here is not about the exact number of postulates. The phrase "single postulate" is just used in comparison with the original "two postulate" formulation. The real question here is whether universal lightspeed can be deduced rather than assumed.
The Lorentz transformations, up to a nonnegative free parameter, can be derived without first postulating the universal lightspeed. Experiment rules out the validity of the Galilean transformations and this means the parameter in the Lorentz transformations is nonzero hence there is a finite maximum speed before anything has been said about light. Combining this with Maxwell's equations shows that light travels at this maximum speed. The numerical value of the parameter in these transformations is determined by experiment, just as the numerical values of the parameter pair c and the permittivity of free space are left to be determined by experiment even when using Einstein's original postulates. When the numerical values in both Einstein's and these other approaches have been found then these different approaches result in the same theory. So the end result of the interlocking trio of theory+Maxwell+experiment is the same either way. This is the sense in which universal lightspeed can be deduced rather than postulated.
For some historical information, see: History of special relativity#Spacetime physics and the section "Lorentz transformation without second postulate" for the approaches of Ignatowski and Frank/Rothe. However, according to Pauli (1921), Resnick (1967), and Miller (1981), those models were insufficient. But the constancy of the speed of light is contained in Maxwell's equations. That section includes the phrase "Ignatowski was forced to recourse to electrodynamics to include the speed of light.". So, the trio of "principle of relativity+Maxwell+numerical values from experiment" gives special relativity and this should be compared with "principle of relativity+second postulate+Maxwell+numerical values from experiment". Since Einstein's 1905 paper is all about electrodynamics he is assuming Maxwell's equations, and the theory isn't practically applicable without numerical values. When compared like with like, from the point of view of asking what is knowable, the second postulate can be deduced. If you restrict your attention to just the standalone theory of relativity then yes you need the postulate. But given all the available knowledge we don't need to postulate it. In other words different domains of knowledge are overlapping and thus taken together have more information than necessary.
This can be summarized as follows:
There are references which discuss in more detail the principle of relativity
Lorentz ether theory.
"Equivalent to the original ? Yes."
Hendrik Lorentz and Henri Poincaré developed their version of special relativity in a series of papers from about 1900 to 1905. They used Maxwell's equations and the principle of relativity to deduce a theory that is mathematically equivalent to the theory later developed by Einstein.
Minkowski spacetime.
"Equivalent to the original ? Yes."
Minkowski space (or Minkowski spacetime) is a mathematical setting in which special relativity is conveniently formulated. Minkowski space is named for the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski, who around 1907 realized that the theory of special relativity (previously developed by Poincaré and Einstein) could be elegantly described using a four-dimensional spacetime, which combines the dimension of time with the three dimensions of space.
Mathematically there are a number of ways in which the four-dimensions of Minkowski spacetime are commonly represented: as a four-vector with 4 real coordinates, as a four-vector with 3 real and one complex coordinate, or using tensors.
Test theories of special relativity.
"Equivalent to the original ? No."
Test theories of special relativity are flat space-time theories which differ from special relativity by having a different postulate about light concerning one-way speed of light vs two-way speed of light. Different postulates on light result in different notions of time simultaneity. There is Robertson's test theory (1949) which predicts different experimental results from Einstein's special relativity, and then there is Edward's theory (1963) which cannot be called a test theory because it is physically equivalent to special relativity, and then there is the Mansouri-Sexl theory (1977) which is equivalent to Robertson's theory.
Curvilinear coordinates and non-inertial frames.
"Equivalent to the original ? Curvilinear is a generalization, but the original SR can be applied locally."
There can be misunderstandings over the sense in which SR can be applied to accelerating frames.
Special relativity cannot be used to describe a global frame for non-inertial i.e. accelerating frames. However general relativity implies that special relativity "can" be applied locally where the observer is confined to making local measurements. For example an analysis of Bremsstrahlung does not require general relativity, SR is sufficient. For examples see Can Special Relativity handle accelerations?, Differential aging from acceleration, an explicit formula and SR treatment of arbitrarily accelerated motion. 
The key point is that you can use special relativity to describe all kinds of accelerated phenomena, and also to predict the measurements made by an accelerated observer who's confined to making measurements at one specific location only. If you try to build a complete frame for such an observer, one that is meant to cover all of spacetime, you'll run into difficulties (there'll be a horizon, for one).
The problem is that you cannot derive from the postulates of special relativity that an acceleration will not have a non-trivial effect. E.g. in case of the twin paradox, we know that you can compute the correct answer of the age difference of the twins simply by integrating the formula for time dilation along the trajectory of the travelling twin. This means that one assumes that at any instant, the twin on its trajectory can be replaced by an inertial observer that is moving at the same velocity of the twin. This gives the correct answer, as long as we are computing effects that are local to the travelling twin. The fact that the acceleration that distinguishes the local inertial rest frame of the twin and the true frame of the twin does not have any additional effect follows from general relativity (it has, of course, been verified experimentally).
In 1943, Moller obtained a transform between an inertial frame and a frame moving with constant acceleration, based on Einstein's vacuum eq and a certain postulated time-independent metric tensor, although this transform is of limited applicability as it does not reduce to the Lorentz transform when a=0. 
Throughout the 20th century efforts were made in order to generalize the Lorentz transformations to a set of transformations linking inertial frames to non-inertial frames with uniform acceleration. So far, these efforts failed to produce satisfactory results that are both consistent with 4-dimensional symmetry and to reduce in the limit a=0 to the Lorentz transformations. Hsu and Hsu claim that they have finally come up with suitable transformations for constant linear acceleration (uniform acceleration). They call these transformations: Generalized Moller-Wu-Lee Transformations. They also say: "But such a generalization turns out not to be unique from a theoretical viewpoint and there are infinitely many generalizations. So far, no established theoretical principle leads to a simple and unique generalization."
de Sitter relativity.
"Equivalent to the original ? No."
According to and the references therein, if you take Minkowski's ideas to their logical conclusion then not only are boosts non-commutative but translations are also non-commutative. This means that the symmetry group of space time is a de Sitter group rather than the Poincaré group. This results in spacetime being slightly curved even in the absence of matter or energy. This residual curvature is caused by a cosmological constant to be determined by observation. Due to the small magnitude of the constant, then special relativity with the Poincaré group is more than accurate 
enough for all practical purposes, although near the big bang and inflation de Sitter relativity may be more useful due to the cosmological constant being larger back then. Note this is not the same thing as solving Einstein's field equations for general relativity to get a de Sitter Universe, rather de Sitter relativity is about getting a de Sitter Group for special relativity which neglects gravity.
Taiji relativity.
"Equivalent to the original ? Yes."
This section is based on the work of Jong-Ping Hsu and Leonardo Hsu. They decided to use the word "Taiji" which is a Chinese word meaning the ultimate principles that existed before the creation of the world. In SI units, time is measured in seconds, but taiji time is measured in units of metres — the same units used to measure space. Their arguments about choosing what units to measure time in, lead them to say that they can develop a theory of relativity which is experimentally indistinguishable from special relativity, but without using the second postulate in their derivation. Their claims have been disputed. There is a discussion of taiji relativity in the book. 
The transformations that they derive involve the factor formula_2 where β is the velocity measured in metres per metre (a dimensionless quantity). This looks the same as (but should NOT be conceptually confused with) the velocity as a fraction of light v/c that appears in some expressions for the Lorentz transformations. Expressing time in metres has previously been done by other authors: Taylor and Wheeler in "Spacetime Physics" and Moore in "Six Ideas that Shaped Physics".
The transformations are derived using just the principle of relativity and have a maximal speed of 1, which is quite unlike "single postulate" derivations of the Lorentz transformations in which you end up with a parameter that may be zero. So this is not the same as other "single postulate" derivations. However the relationship of taiji time "w" to standard time "t" must still be found, otherwise it would not be clear how an observer would measure taiji time. The taiji transformations are then combined with Maxwell's equations to show that the speed of light is independent of the observer and has the value 1 in taiji speed (i.e. it has the maximal speed). This can be thought of as saying: a time of 1 metre is the time it takes for light to travel 1 metre. Since we can measure the speed of light by experiment in m/s to get the value c, we can use this as a conversion factor. i.e. we have now found an operational definition of taiji time: w=ct.
So we have: w metres = (c m/s) * t seconds
But it is not just due to the choice of units that there is a maximum speed. It is the principle of relativity, that Hsu&Hsu say, when applied to 4d spacetime, implies the invariance of the 4d-spacetime interval formula_3 and this leads to the coordinate transformations involving the factor formula_4 where beta is the magnitude of the velocity between two inertial frames. The difference between this and the spacetime interval formula_5 in Minkowski space is that formula_3 is invariant purely by the principle of relativity whereas formula_5 requires both postulates.
The "principle of relativity" in spacetime is taken to mean invariance of laws under 4-dimensional transformations.
Hsu&Hsu then explore other relationships between w and t such as w=bt where b is a function. They show that there are versions of relativity which are consistent with experiment but have a definition of time where the "speed" of light is not constant. They develop one such version called "common relativity" which is more convenient for performing calculations for "relativistic many body problems" than using special relativity.
Euclidean relativity.
"Equivalent to the original ? No, the velocity addition formula is different."
Euclidean relativity uses a Euclidean (++++) metric as opposed to the traditional Minkowski (+---) or (-+++) metric which is derived from the Minkowski metric by rewriting formula_8 into the equivalent formula_9.
The roles of time t and proper time formula_10 have switched so that proper time formula_10 takes the role of the coordinate for the 4th spatial dimension. A universal velocity formula_12 for all objects in 4D space-time appears from the regular time derivative formula_13.
The approach differs from the so-called Wick rotation or "complex" Euclidean relativity. In Wick rotation, time formula_14 is replaced by formula_15, which also leads to a positive definite metric but it maintains proper time formula_10 as the Lorentz invariant value whereas in Euclidean relativity formula_10 becomes a coordinate. Because formula_13 implies that photons travel at the speed of light in the subspace {x, y, z} and baryonic matter that is at rest in {x, y, z} travels normal to photons along formula_19, a paradox arises on how photons can be propagated in a space-time. The possible existence of parallel space-times or parallel worlds shifted and co-moving along formula_10 is the approach of Giorgio Fontana. 
The Euclidean geometry is consistent with classical, Minkowski based relativity in two reference frames. The hyperbolic Minkowski geometry turns into a rotation in 4D circular geometry where length contraction and time dilation result from the geometric projection of 4D properties to 3D space. In three reference frames an inconsistency appears in the velocity addition formula, also affecting other formulas that depend on the velocity addition formula. The inconsistency does so far not imply known contradictions with experimental data but compared to the classical formula it predicts small deviations (<formula_21 m/s) in the addition result when both input speeds are very high (>10 km/s) and have similar magnitude.
Very special relativity.
"Equivalent to the original ? No"
Ignoring gravity, experimental bounds seem to suggest that special relativity with its Lorentz symmetry and Poincaré symmetry describes spacetime. Surprisingly, Cohen and Glashow 
have demonstrated that a small subgroup of the Lorentz group is sufficient to explain all the current bounds.
The minimal subgroup in question can be described as follows: The stabilizer of a null vector is the special Euclidean group SE(2), which contains T(2) as the subgroup of parabolic transformations. This T(2), when extended to include either parity or time reversal (i.e. subgroups of the orthochronous and time-reversal respectively), is sufficient to give us all the standard predictions. Their new symmetry is called Very Special Relativity (VSR).
Doubly special relativity.
"Equivalent to the original ? No."
Doubly special relativity (DSR) is a modified theory of special relativity in which there is not only an observer-independent maximum velocity (the speed of light), but an observer-independent minimum length (the Planck length).
The motivation to these proposals is mainly theoretical, based on the following observation: The Planck length is expected to play a fundamental role in a theory of Quantum Gravity, setting the scale at which Quantum Gravity effects cannot be neglected and "new" phenomena are observed. If Special Relativity is to hold up exactly to this scale, different observers would observe Quantum Gravity effects at different scales, due to the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction, in contradiction to the principle that all inertial observers should be able to describe phenomena by the same physical laws. 
A drawback of the usual doubly special relativity models is that they are valid only at the energy scales where ordinary special relativity is supposed to break down, giving rise to a patchwork relativity. On the other hand, de Sitter relativity is found to be invariant under a simultaneous re-scaling of mass, energy and momentum, and is consequently valid at all energy scales.

Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz

The Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz ( "") was a political union established after the Kingdom of Hejaz had been conquered by the Sultanate of Nejd under Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud in 1925.
History.
On 8 January 1926, Ibn Saud, the Sultan of Nejd, was crowned King of the Hejaz in the Masjid al-Haram in Makkah, and he elevated Nejd to the status of a kingdom on 27 January 1927. At the Treaty of Jeddah on 20 May 1927, Ibn Saud's realm was recognised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and was addressed as the Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz.
For the next five years, Ibn Saud administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units. On 23 September 1932, the main Saudi dominions of Al-Hasa, Qatif, Nejd and the Hejaz were unified as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Foreign policy.
The Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz could pursue its expansionist policy by British arms supplies because of its close relations with the United Kingdom. Under Ibn Saud, the Hejaz withdrew from the League of Nations.
In 1926, the Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz was recognised by the United Soviet Socialist Republics, followed by the United States of America in 1931. By 1932, the United Kingdom, the USSR, Turkey, the Imperial State of Iran and The Netherlands maintained legations in Jeddah; The French Third Republic, the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Egypt maintained unofficial consular representatives.

Dickinson Electronic Archives

The "Dickinson Electronic Archives" (DEA) is a website devoted to the study of Emily Dickinson, her writing practices, writings directly influencing her work, and critical and creative writings generated by her work. The DEA is produced by the Dickinson Editing Collective, with an executive editor, a general editor, two associate editors, a project manager, and a technical editor working collaboratively with one another and with numerous coeditors, staff, and users.
History.
The "Dickinson Electronic Archives" was begun in 1994 by Emily Dickinson scholar and University of Maryland, College Park professor Martha Nell Smith. It was the first online digital repository of its kind and featured a limited number of Dickinson manuscripts and correspondences.
In 2000, the "DEA" received its first major overhaul. This overhaul included the additions of more manuscripts and correspondences, as well as "Titanic Operas" – a section highlighting the responses of contemporary poets to Emily Dickinson – and a section of the "DEA" dedicated to helping teachers utilize digital resources in classroom instruction.
Current.
Although originally created to showcase the writings of and scholarship concerning American poet Emily Dickinson, the "Dickinson Electronic Archives" projects have since expanded to include as well the writings of Emily Dickinson's correspondents, many of whom were family members such as Susan Dickinson and nephew Edward (Ned) Dickinson. The "DEA" has also grown to feature numerous images of Dickinson’s manuscripts – both poetic manuscripts and letters – as well as detailed scholastic analysis by executive editor Martha Nell Smith and other leading Dickinson scholars.
One of the primary missions of the "Dickinson Electronic Archives" is to enhance knowledge surrounding Emily Dickinson, one of the United States' most admired and popular poets and beloved nineteenth-century figures, through the contextual clues of her creative process as discovered in her manuscripts. While casual biographies of Dickinson are likely to describe the poet as isolated, morbid, crazy, humorless, and a writer of "little poems," her written records suggest otherwise. Dickinson’s manuscripts and correspondences, as showcased in the "Dickinson Electronic Archives", show that Emily Dickinson sometimes collaborated with another writer, that she sometimes reveled in a bawdy sense of humor, and that letter writing became an artistic form for her, one she exploited for poetic experimentation.
Citations and References.
As a leader in Digital Humanities and one of the first digital literature projects, the Dickinson Electronic Archives have been at the center of critical discussion for over ten years, appearing at the center of critical discussion in hundreds of scholarly articles, journals, and books.

John Levett (author)

John Levett was of the author of a ground-breaking early study of the habits of bees, with close observation of their behaviour and suggestions on how to manage their hives, published in London in 1634. The tome was one of the first agricultural textbooks, with a preface in rhyme by the author Samuel Purchas. It is among the earliest examples of what later became a flood of literature treating the English love of gardening and horticulture.
John's Levett's identity is unclear. The author of "The Ordering of Bees: Or, The True History of Managing Them" is thought to have been a clergyman, and possibly the nephew of English explorer Capt. Christopher Levett, one of the earliest explorers of New England.
His book was considered groundbreaking because it combined close observation of bees with field experience in managing beehives. Levett explored the debate over bee gender, and over their means of reproducing. Levett's work quickly became the favoured book on the subject. Robert Child, the foremost agriculture writer of his day, said of Levett: "Hee is the best that ever write of this subject."
At least part of Levett's appeal, aside from his careful study of his subjects, was his somewhat sly sense of humor. The drones, Levett warned, were "necessary and helpfull to the Bees, so long as they exceed not a due proportion (much like to Our lawyers), but let their number grow to(o) great (as it often doth) and they will indeed devoure the substance of the Bees (as the Lawyers of the Commonwealth) and bring it to destruction."
In his discourse on bees, Levett drew many parallels to human society. The Master Bee, Levett wrote, had regal authority, "correcting the lazie, sloathfull, and disobedient, and giving honour and incouragement to those which are painfull, laborious and diligent." The Master Bees, Levett wrote, "are absolute in their authorities and commands," and were essential, Levett believed, in the organizing the hierarchy of and ensuring the ultimate success of the hive.
The preface to Levett's book was written by "S. Purcas" in rhyme, who was undoubtedly English author and travel writer Samuel Purchas. "Thy selfe, thy self enough, enough thy Booke, Thy book commands, and I, my Levett, leave it, Here in small Bees, God's greatnesse first I looke, And thee thy selfe though dead to live yet."
Nor were the results of apian labours limited to simple honey. Bee products, Levett told his readers, could be used in domestic hygiene, physick and surgery. Levett was not troubled by the thought that the bee was placed on earth to serve man. In the sort of thinking that stamped the age of exploration and colonization, Levett consigned the bee to his role as supporting player. "Hath not God given all creatures unto us for our benefit, and to be used accordingly as may seem good unto us for our good?," Levett wrote. "We see that many creatures of greater account are daily killed in infinite numbers for our sustenance and often for our pleasure, and is it not lawful for us, to use these silly creatures in such sort as they may be most for our benefit, which I take to be the right use of them and the very end of their creation?" 
In Levett's worldview, nature was there to serve her master. It fell to man the task of "orderinge" the bees. Rather than simply observing, the beekeeper's job was to take the honey and kill the bees afterwards so the colony didn't raid honey from other unharvested colonies nearby. Levett dismissed the concerns of those who said it was "a pity to kill the bees that have so laboured for us," calling such talk "a foolish and fond conceit."
Eventually, advances in the study of bees and in agricultural theory would change the conception of the role of the beekeeper, who would eventually come to be seen as a manager of resources, rather than one set out to tame wild nature and bend it to man's purposes. The beekeeper would be turned into part of 'husbandry,' and a mainstay of the rural economy. But in Levett's worldview, what one scholar calls his "aggressively patriarchal" style, the bees should be driven and made to perform. "Bees might be superior to all other insects," writes Bee Wilson, "but they were still of a different estate from men."
English beekeeping remained largely unchanged for centuries, until the late nineteenth century when moveable-frame hives were invented. By that time, the new hives and improved artificial wax foundations, new smokers, even new breeds of bees meant that the beekeepers of John Levett's day became the more dignified 'apiarists'. In today's world of collapsing bee populations, the Levett model of 'bee domination,' a mirror of its epoch of exploration and colonization, seems particularly dated.

Eduardus Halim

Eduardus Halim is an Indonesian-American pianist.
Born in Bandung, Indonesia of Chinese parents, Halim made his public debut at the age of 11 playing Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3. A student of Sascha Gorodnitzki and Rudolf Firkušný at the Juilliard School where he attended on full scholarship, Halim later studied with Vladimir Horowitz, to whom he was recommended by Harold C. Schonberg and David Dubal. His experience working with the late maestro is documented in Schonberg's book, "Horowitz: His Life and Music". He won 4th prize at the 1985 Sydney International Piano Competition, and 3rd prize at the 1988 competition. Halim began his international concert career in 1989 after winning the Young Concert Artists International Auditions.
He is the inaugural holder of the Sascha Gorodnitzki Chair in Piano Studies and a member of the Artist Faculty at New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development.
Recordings.
Halim’s first recording, “Presenting Eduardus Halim: A Program of Piano Transcriptions,” was released on the Arabesque label to wide critical acclaim. Fanfare Magazine wrote: “Winged by an effortless technique, Halim is relaxed, spontaneous, almost casual in this superhumanly demanding fare…Enthusiastically recommended!”
His second CD release, a Chopin disc for Reservoir Studio Productions, was also well received. Stephen Wigler writes, “who misses Vladimir Horowitz would be wise to investigate this all-Chopin recital by Eduardus Halim, the last of the master’s students; he is a born Chopinist…Rather than call him his master’s disciple, it would be better to call him his successor.” This disc was named one of the top classical instrumental CDs of 2000 by Amazon.com. Halim’s latest recording for Reservoir Studio Productions features music of Enrique Granados—the piano suite Goyescas, and the seven Valses Poéticos. The American Record Guide notes, “[how good is Eduardus Halim? In the Goyescas and Valses Poeticos, absolutely magnificent!…Halim continues to amaze by the rightness of his inflections and the subtlety of his rich sound palette….This deserves a standing ovation.”

<doc id="20070084" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20070084" title="Caribbean theater of the American Revolutionary War">
Caribbean theater of the American Revolutionary War

The Caribbean theater of the American Revolutionary War was the scene of numerous naval and amphibious engagements, principally involving the forces of Great Britain and France between 1778 and 1782.
Background.
Britain's numerous island colonies in the West Indies were politically divided with respect to the issues that eventually drove the Thirteen Colonies in North America to revolution. Some colonial assemblies expressed sympathy for the rebel movement, but the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in April 1775 did not result in similar mobilizations in the Caribbean. British military authorities, in fact, drew resources from there to support their activities against the rebel colonies in the early years of the war.
The main impact on the British West Indies in those early years was economic. The islands were dependent on North America for a number of resources, including lumber for construction and food to feed the large slave population that worked on plantations producing sugar cane for export. This trade fell substantially after the Royal Navy began blockading major ports in North America. Some trade continued, but the Americans, desperate for supplies (particularly military supplies, like gunpowder) from Europe, engaged in trade with French and Dutch possessions in the Caribbean. The Dutch island of Sint Eustatius in particular became a major supply point where Dutch merchants and officially sanctioned French traders did business with American merchants.
The situation changed following the entry of France into the war as an American ally in early 1778.
1778-1779.
News of France's entry into the war reached the French governor at Martinique, the marquis de Bouillé, in August 1778. He immediately planned and executed the Invasion of Dominica, successfully taking the island on September 7.
The French Admiral the comte d'Estaing, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Newport, Rhode Island, sailed from Boston for the West Indies on November 4. On the same day, Commodore William Hotham was dispatched from New York to reinforce the British fleet in the West Indies. Admiral Samuel Barrington, the British admiral in the Leeward Islands, retaliated against the capture of Dominica by seizing Saint Lucia on December 13–14, after the arrival of Hotham from North America. D'Estaing, who followed Hotham closely, was beaten off in two feeble attacks on Barrington at the Cul-de-Sac of Santa Lucia on December 15.
On January 6, 1779, Admiral Jack Byron reached the West Indies. During the early part of this year the naval forces in the West Indies were mainly employed in watching one another and building in strength. But in June, while Byron went to Antigua to guard the trade convoy on its way home, d'Estaing first captured St Vincent, and then Grenada. Admiral Byron sailed in hopes of saving first one and then the other, arrived off Grenada shortly after it fell. An indecisive action was fought off Grenada on July 6, 1779 in which Byron's fleet was significantly damaged. The war died down in the West Indies, with Byron repairing his fleet, and d'Estaing failing to capitalize on French naval superiority. Byron returned home in August. D'Estaing was ordered back to France in August, but instead answered appeals from the Americans for assistance in retaking Savannah, Georgia, which had fallen to British forces in December 1778. After the unsuccessful Siege of Savannah d'Estaing sailed for France.
Spain entered the war in 1779 as a French ally, further widening the war. Spanish colonial forces on the Yucatan peninsula captured the principal British settlement in present-day Belize at Saint George's Caye in September, and British forces from Jamaica briefly occupied the fortress of San Fernando de Omoa in present-day Honduras. Spain's entry into the war stretched British resources even further, since the combined Spanish and French naval forces exceeded theirs.
1780-1781.
The 1780 campaign season was comparatively quiet. A French fleet under the comte de Guichen sparred with that of George Brydges Rodney in the inconclusive Battle of Martinique, but neither side was able to maneuver away from the other for substantive operations against the other's possessions. British authorities launched a major expedition from Jamaica, initially led by the young Horatio Nelson, to gain control of Spanish Nicaragua. The San Juan Expedition was a disastrous failure, and one of the most expensive British ventures in the war.
In late 1780 the Dutch Republic was formally brought into the war, and the British government was compelled to withdraw part of its fleet from other purposes to protect the North Sea trade.
In the West Indies, Rodney, having received news of the breach with the Netherlands early in the year, took the island of Sint Eustatius, which had been a great depot of contraband of war, on February 3, 1781. He also authorized privateering against other Dutch targets, which resulted in the capture of three Dutch colonial outposts in South America. Rodney was accused of applying himself so entirely to seizing and selling the booty taken at Sint Eustatius that he would not allow his second in command, Sir Samuel Hood, who had recently joined him, to take proper measures to impede the arrival of French forces known to be on their way to Martinique. The French admiral, the comte de Grasse, reached the island with reinforcements in April, driving Hood away in the process. De Grasse then embarked on a diversionary attack on St. Lucia that masked the detachment of some of his fleet to capture Tobago. De Grasse and Rodney then engaged in a series of skilful but ultimately fruitless operations in which the former sought advantage to attack British holdings and otherwise avoid battle.
In one of the most significant miscalculations of the war, Admiral Rodney, in ill health, decided to return half his fleet to Europe at the start of 1781 hurricane season, leaving Admiral Hood with the other half to follow de Grasse. De Grasse, however, decided to undertake the risky proposition of taking almost all of his fleet to North America, leaving the French merchant fleet with only minimal Spanish protection. When de Grasse sailed north in August, this resulted in a significant imbalance of naval power in favor of the French in North American waters.
On the coast of North America, the war came to its climax. When Hood arrived off Chesapeake Bay in late August, de Grasse had not yet arrived, since he had deliberately taken a longer route to avoid notice. Hood proceeded on to New York, bringing news of de Grasse's approach (although ignorant of his strength) to Arbuthnot's successor, Admiral Thomas Graves. Word that de Barras had sailed from Newport with the entire French fleet led Graves to lead the combined fleet south to the Chesapeake, where de Grasse had in the meantime arrived. In the pivotal Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5, de Grasse got the better of the British, who ended up retreating back to New York while de Barras slipped into the Chesapeake carrying the French siege train. The naval blockade completed the encirclement of the British army of Charles Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia, where he was compelled to surrender on October 19. Cornwallis' surrender spelled the end of significant military operations in North America, and led to the start of peace negotiations. While they went on, the war continued in other theaters.
1782.
Following the surrender of Lord Cornwallis there was a tacit armistice on continental North America between Britain and the United States during the winter of 1781–1782. A large convoy and reinforcements for the Antilles were being prepared in France, with the aim of putting de Grasse's fleet in a state of readiness to support the struggle against Rodney's force.
De Grasse returned to the West Indies in November 1781, where he was followed by Hood, and resumed attacks on the British islands. In January and February 1782, de Grasse conquered St. Christopher, while a smaller French fleet under Kersaint retook the Dutch South American colonies, and de Barras took Sint Eustatius from Britain. De Grasse's action at St. Christopher was vigorously opposed by Hood, who with a much inferior force first drove de Grasse from his anchorage at Basseterre and then repulsed his repeated attacks. Hood's action was insufficient, however, to prevent the French from successfully gaining control of the island.
Battle of the Saintes.
The next objective of the French was to join with a Spanish fleet for an attack on Jamaica. Admiral Rodney, having returned to his command with reinforcements, countered this plan with a series of operations which culminated in the Battle of the Saintes on April 12, 1782.
The large convoy that had left France escorted by admiral de Guichen was scattered by a storm. The British regrouped all their naval forces in the Caribbean, and the comte de Grasse, despite his fleet's inferiority, set sail to convey the troops of M. de Bouillé which had had to regroup, at Saint-Domingue, with those commanded by the Spanish general don Galvez for the assault on Jamaica. Admiral Rodney gave chase, manoeuvring to cut the French fleet off from its convoy, but was only able to reach the vessel "Zélé", the slowest ship in the rearguard, on April 9. The comte de Grasse decided to save this ship and committed his vanguard under the command of M. de Vaudreuil.
Although the French prevailed in this initial encounter, Admiral Rodney followed them and, having got the weather gage, engaged the entire French fleet on 12 April. The French admiral's flagship "Ville de Paris" and six others were immobilised and captured in the face of resistance. The comte de Grasse was captured and only gained his freedom the following year, when the war ended. His vessel's bridge had been completely razed by British bullets and the admiral and two officers were the only two people standing not to have been wounded when the ship finally surrendered, and Admiral Rodney could not hold onto any of the four vessels he had captured since they were too badly damaged. The "César" also caught fire and sank with around 400 British sailors who had taken possession of her.
Although there were a number of minor engagements in the aftermath of the Battle of the Saintes, no further major actions took place in the West Indies.
Peace proposal.
When news of the Saintes reached the United States, the Continental Congress considered whether to receive General Carleton, who had replaced Sir Henry Clinton as supreme commander of the British land forces in America, and his proposition from the British government to fully recognise the United States' independence in return for America renouncing its alliance with France. The Congress did not let itself be influenced by news of the French disaster in the West Indies and showed only indignation at it, refusing to admit the negotiator who was responsible for this suggestion. The States unanimously declared any proposition for a separate peace as high treason. These overtures, as well as the armistice demanded at the same time by the commander of Charleston and refused by General Nathanael Greene, were sufficient proof that (despite their success in the West Indies) the British were about to give up forcing their former colonies to submit. The Americans certainly desired peace, but showed their loyalty to their French allies and appreciation of their help by making new sacrifices to gain a peace that was as honourable for their allies as for themselves.
On their part, the French government only stopped sending help to the Americans when the poor state of their national finances left them no option but to do so. Two frigates, the "Gloire" and "Aigle", were sent from Brest on 19 May 1782 under the command of M. de la Touche Tréville. These ships were however intercepted and defeated by the British in the Delaware river on 15 September 1782 and La Touche was made prisoner. This left marquis de Vaudreuil who took over from the captured comte de Grasse as commander of the fleet and received the order to sail into Boston to repair and refit his squadron.

1985 FA Charity Shield

The 1985 FA Charity Shield was the 63rd FA Charity Shield, an annual football match played between the winners of the previous season's First Division and FA Cup competitions. The match was played on 10 August 1985 at Wembley Stadium and contested by Everton, who had won the 1984–85 First Division, and Manchester United, who had won the 1984–85 FA Cup. Everton won 2–0 with goals from Trevor Steven and Adrian Heath. Trevor Steven put Everton into the lead when he swept home from six yards after a cross from the left in the first half. The second goal came in the second half when Manchester United goalkeeper Gary Bailey dropped a cross from the left to allow Adrian Heath to tip the ball past him into the left corner of the net.
The Charity Shield was the first competitive game that new striker Gary Lineker played for Everton, and although he failed to get on the scoresheet in the game he made up for it by scoring 40 goals in all competitions that season. He took the place in the team previously occupied by Andy Gray. Kevin Moran of Manchester United had been sent off in the final and he was suspended for this game, with his place in the side being taken by understudy Graeme Hogg. These were the only two differences between the first XI of this game and the FA Cup final earlier in May 1985.

No Exit (1962 film)

No Exit, also known as Sinners Go to Hell, is a 1962 film adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre's play "No Exit" directed by Tad Danielewski. The film stars Morgan Sterne (1926-2011), Viveca Lindfors, and Rita Gam.
Plot.
The Valet (Manuel Rosón) enters a hotel room with Joseph Garcin (Morgan Sterne) in tow. The windowless room has a single entrance and no mirrors. Two women, Inès Serrano (Viveca Lindfors) and Estelle Rigault (Rita Gam), are then led in; afterwards, the Valet leaves and locks the door. Realizing that they are in hell, the trio expects to be tortured; however, no torturer is forthcoming. While waiting, they strike up a conversation and discuss each other's sins, desires, and unpleasant memories; they slowly realized that such probing is the form of torture they are meant to receive.
It later becomes apparent that Joseph, once a journalist, was executed for cowardice and the betrayal of the French Resistance. Estelle, who has a voracious sexual appetite, was a gold digger and seductress who killed a man. Meanwhile, the lesbian Inès abused her partner's love for her and eventually killed them both in a murder-suicide. As the story progresses, Garcin becomes increasingly annoyed by Inès' considering him a coward, while Estelle makes unreciprocated advances on him; Inès is tempted by Estelle, but crazed by Estelle's heterosexuality.
The three at first continue to see events happening on Earth, but eventually, as the living move on, they are left with only their own thoughts and the company of the other two. Towards the end of the film, Garcin demands he be let out; in response, the door opens. However, none leave. They resign themselves to their fate.
Production.
Sartre did not know about the film while it was in production. Viveca Lindfors, at the time married to screenwriter George Tabori, was chosen to play Inès.
Style.
The film uses dialogue-free flashbacks when the main characters talk about their lives. Alison Darren in the "Lesbian Film Guide" notes that Inès is a "typical screen lesbian" of the early 1960s, both physically attractive and inherently evil.
Release and reception.
After being screened at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival in June 1962, where Rita Gam and Viveca Lindfors shared the Silver Bear for Best Actress award, "No Exit" received its American release on December 5.
Bosley Crowther, writing for the "New York Times", found the film "antiseptic", with emotionless acting and stagy directing; he summarized that the film "provethat "No Exit" is inappropriate material for a full-length [film". Darren calls the film an "excellent psychological drama" with a "surprisingly overt" depiction of lesbianism.

Lovegety

Lovegety was a proximity matchmaking device available in Japan, which allowed users to find potential dates that match their personal preferences in the vicinity. Over 1,300,000 of these units were sold in Japan at an approximate price of $21.
It was the first such device, and "the first commercial attempt to move introduction systems away from the desktop and into reality".
There were three modes users could pre-select on the Lovegety device which reflected the mood they were currently in and hence what kind of partner they were looking for. These included “let’s just chat”, “let’s go sing some karaoke” and “get2” or "looking for love" modes. The devices could be set to interact with each other when a potential mate was within close proximity (15 feet) or to simply notify a user of others who are currently set to the same mood. 
Howard Rheingold reflects on technologies such as the Lovegety in his work and urges that as consumers we think carefully about the social implications of these technologies. Rheingold states that ‘loss of privacy is perhaps the most obvious shadow side of technological cooperation systems’

U-10-class submarine

The "U-10" class was a class of five submarines or U-boats of the Austro-Hungarian Navy () during World War I. The class was similar to the German Type UB I submarine of the German Imperial Navy (); the first two boats delivered to Austria-Hungary had previously been commissioned in Kaiserliche Marine.
The "U-10" class as a whole did not have much wartime success, with three of the boats sinking either one or no ships. Only one boat, sank more than of enemy ships. Of the five submarines of the class, only was sunk during the war; the remaining four were delivered as war reparations and broken up by 1920.
Background.
The Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet at the beginning of World War I consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were not operational. The Navy did have five s under construction in Germany, but a perceived inability to sail the completed submarines past Gibraltar to Pola led to a hasty decision to sell them to Germany, a severe setback for Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet.
In order to bolster their fleet, which had already been boosted by the recovery and commissioning of the French submarine "Curie" as "U-14" in 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Navy purchased five German UB-type coastal submarines, which had the advantages of short construction time and the ability to be shipped by rail—which avoided the perceived pitfalls of sea delivery. The first contract in February 1915 secured the purchase of and , initially commissioned as the German Type UB I U-boats "UB-1" and "UB-15", respectively. A further contract on 1 April 1915, purchased three more boats, , , and .
Design and construction.
The "U-10"-class boats were small coastal submarines that displaced surfaced and submerged. For propulsion, they featured a single shaft, a single diesel engine for surface running, and a single electric motor for submerged travel. The boats were capable of while surfaced and while submerged at a diving depth of up to . All five had slightly different conning tower configurations, but were all designed for a crew of 17 officers and men.
The lead boat of the class, "U-10", was built by Germaniawerft of Kiel, while the other four were constructed by AG Weser of Bremen. All five were transported by rail in sections to Pola, where they only needed riveting together to be complete, a process that typically took about two weeks.
"U-10" was the first ship of the class launched, as the German "UB-1" on 22 January 1915. The other four boats were launched by April. "UB-1" and "UB-15" were initially commissioned into the "Kaiserliche Marine" in January and April, respectively, each with German commanders and crew, but with an Austro-Hungarian Navy officer for piloting and training purposes, but both were commissioned into the "K.u.K. Kriegsmarine" with Austro-Hungarian crews by July. The other three ships were never manned by German crews and had all been commissioned by early October when each is listed in sources with a commanding officer.
Armament.
The "U-10" class boats were equipped with two torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes. The German Type UB I submarines were additionally equipped with a machine gun, but it is not clear from sources if "U-10" and "U-11", the former German boats, were either equipped with them or, if so, retained them in Austro-Hungarian service. In October 1916, all the boats except "U-11" received 37 mm/23 (1.5 in) quick-firing (QF) guns. "U-11" received a 66 mm/18 (2.6 in) gun originally planned for "U-14" (which received a larger gun instead). In November 1917, the 37 mm guns were replaced by 47 mm/23 (1.9 in) QF guns.
War activities.
All five boats of the "U-10" class took part in the war, but, as a class, had limited success. Although "UB-1" and "UB-15" had each had sunk a single ship while commissioned in the German Imperial Navy during 1915, neither boat sank any ships in Austro-Hungarian service. "U-17" torpedoed a single ship, the Italian destroyer "Impetuoso", which sank on 10 July 1916. "U-16" sank two small sailing ships in late 1915 and torpedoed and sank the Italian destroyer "Nembo" on 16 October 1916. "U-15" was the most successful of the class, sinking six ships for a total of . On a single day, 25 June 1916, "U-15" sank the Italian auxiliary cruiser and the French destroyer "Fourche" in the Strait of Otranto, accounting for almost half of her wartime successes.
Of the five boats, only "U-16" was sunk during the war, shortly after sinking "Nembo". The only other casualty among the class involved "U-10", which hit a mine near Caorle and was beached with heavy damage. Although she was looted by Austro-Hungarian Army troops, she was later towed to Trieste for repairs which remained incomplete at the war's end. After the end of fighting in November 1918, the four surviving class members—"U-10", "U-11", "U-15", and "U-17"—were all turned over to Italy as war reparations and scrapped at Pola by 1920.
Class members.
SM "U-10".
SM "U-10" was the lead boat of the "U-10" class of submarines for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but was originally named "UB-1" as a part of the German Imperial Navy. She was laid down on 1 November 1914 in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 22 January 1915. Commissioned one week later as SM "UB-1", she sank one Italian torpedo boat in her German service. In July, she was handed over to the Austro-Hungarian Navy and commissioned as SM "U-10". She was the target of an unsuccessful torpedo attack by a British submarine in May 1917. In July 1918, "U-10" hit a mine and was beached with heavy damage. She was towed to Trieste for repairs which remained unfinished at the war's end. She was handed over to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.

In her only wartime success, she sank an Italian submarine in German service in early June. Shortly thereafter, she was delivered to the Austro-Hungarian Navy and commissioned as SM "U-11" on 14 June. In early 1916, "U-11" made a torpedo attack on a British submarine but missed. She was delivered to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.
SM "U-15".
SM "U-15" was constructed in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched in September 1915 and commissioned on 6 October. "U-15" was the most successful boat of the "U-10" class, sinking six ships totaling more than . She survived the war and was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.
SM "U-16".
SM "U-16" was constructed in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 26 April 1915 and commissioned on 6 October. "U-16" sank one ship in November 1915 and seized another in December. While operating in the Adriatic off the coast of Albania in mid-October 1916, "U-16" sank an Italian destroyer acting as a convoy escort. "U-16" was sunk in the ensuing action, but sources are not clear on the exact cause of her sinking.
SM "U-17".
SM "U-17" was constructed in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 21 April 1915 and commissioned on 6 October. "U-17" sank an Italian destroyer in July 1916 as part of an effort to disrupt the Otranto Barrage but sank no other ships during the war. The boat survived the war and was delivered to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.

Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon, duc de Mahon

Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon (22 February 1717 – 5 April 1796) was the 4th Duke of Crillon and 1st Duke of Mahon. He became a soldier at the age of 16 and served with distinction in the French army before transferring to the army of Spain, which was allied with France for much of the 18th century. By the end of his life he had risen to the highest military rank in Spain and it was said that he had served in 68 engagements. His most famous achievement was the successful invasion of Minorca in 1781, in which he defeated a British garrison and returned the island to Spain, although his efforts the following year to recapture Gibraltar from the British were a notable failure.
Early life and career.
Born in Avignon on 22 February 1717, Crillon was a member of a distinguished family that had originated in Chieri, Piedmont. His branch of the family had a long history of military service to the French crown. A descendant of the famous 16th-century general Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon ("the brave Crillon"), he was the son of the 3rd Duke of Crillon, François Félix de Berton des Balbes, and Marie-Thérèse de Fabry de Moncault. Louis was the first-born of the couple's six children (four boys and two girls).
Crillon joined the "Régiment du Roi" (King's Regiment) in 1734, aged 16, as a "lieutenant en second" and participated in France's Italian campaign during the War of the Polish Succession. He was soon promoted to "lieutenant en premier" and took part in a number of notable actions, including the Battle of San Pietro, under the command of the Marshal de Villars. He remained with the regiment until 1738 when he was promoted to the rank of colonel in the "Régiment de Bretagne" (Regiment of Brittany).
Service in the War of the Austrian Succession.
In 1742, he served with distinction in Bavaria under the command of the duc d'Harcourt during the War of the Austrian Succession. Crillon won particular renown for his tenacious defence of Landau an der Isar against a 10,000–strong attacking force led by the Grand Duke of Tuscany. When he was asked to surrender, Crillon told the enemy general that he could not as he had a name and a personal reputation to defend. The general is said to have replied, "Sir, we know and believe since the beginning of the campaign; but give up, brave Crillon, you will be taken." He was captured after a thirteen-hour battle but was released eight days later in a prisoner exchange.
Crillon served again under d'Harcourt in 1744 when the latter commanded the Army of the Moselle during its campaigns along the Rhine. He participated in the siege of Fribourg and spent the winter in Swabia under the command of Marshal Coigny as colonel of an infantry regiment. In May 1745, he fought in the major Battle of Fontenoy near Tournai in modern-day Belgium and captured nearly 50 pieces of artillery from the Dutch, British, and Hanoverian alliance opposing the French. The following month he was appointed brigadier. On 10 July, he fought in what the French termed the battle of the Mésle at Dendermonde near Ghent, leading 8,000 men to victory against a British, Austrian and Dutch force. He then took part in the captures of Ghent, Ostend and Nieuwpoort.
In 1746 Crillon transferred to the command of the duc de Boufflers to serve in the headquarters of the Army of Flanders during the Siege of Mons and rejoined the royal army following the city's capture. He brought the king news of the capture of the town and castle of Namur in October of that year, and was appointed to the rank of maréchal de camp, the junior of the two officer general ranks of the French Army. He took part in the 1747 campaign against the Republic of Genoa, serving in the Army of Italy under the Marshal de Belle-Isle, and was present during the captures of Nice, Villefranche, Montalbán and Ventimiglia.
Service in the Seven Years' War.
After a decade of peace that ended with the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, Crillon resumed active service with the Army of Germany in 1757, when he first served in a separate corps commanded by the Prince of Soubise on the frontiers of Saxony and then joined the French Grand Army. He defended the city of Weißenfels in October 1757, commanding four imperial battalions and 17 companies of French grenadiers. He was able to execute a well-organised retreat, but on 5 November he was injured when he had his horse shot out from under him. 
Transferred to the command of the Marshal de Richelieu, he served for a while in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. He fought at Lutzenburg in October 1758, where he took 400 prisoners, and moved on to take the strategic castle of Spangenberg. Although it was heavily fortified he took the garrison by surprise on 9 November. Finding that the drawbridge was down, his troops took the garrison prisoner and seized their armoury, including 18 cannon, 307 guns and 44 barrels of powder. He returned to Flanders in May 1759 and was appointed to command French forces in Picardy in 1760.
Service with Spain.
In 1762 Crillon moved to Spain, where he served as a lieutenant-general – the highest rank in the Bourbon armies – and was made a Knight of the Order of Charles III in 1780. During the American War of Independence, when Spain and France allied with the Americans to fight Britain, he was given command of a Spanish army tasked with capturing Minorca from the British. The army landed on the island in August 1781 and laid siege to the British garrison in Fort St. Philip at Mahon. The siege was concluded successfully in February 1782 when the British surrendered, for which Crillon was made a grandee of Spain and took the title of Duke of Crillon-Mahon. He was subsequently put in charge of the joint French and Spanish force that had been besieging Gibraltar since 1779. Despite his efforts, Gibraltar proved impregnable and peace was restored in 1783.
Crillon's service with Spain was further rewarded in 1783 with the title of Knight of the Golden Fleece. He was appointed captain-general of the kingdoms of Valencia and Murcia. He remained in Spain during the years of the French Revolutionary Wars, writing his memoirs ("Memoires militaires de Louis de Berton des Balbes de Quiers"), published in 1791.) He took no part in the War of the Pyrenees (1793–95) between Spain and revolutionary France, but played a significant role in agreeing the peace that terminated the conflict. He died in Madrid in 1796.
Reputation and family life.
The courtesy and chivalry of Crillon attracted much admiration during his lifetime and afterwards. As the English anecdotist William Seward put it in 1798, "Courtesy, no less than courage, was always the appenage of the family of Crillon". During the siege of Gibraltar, he sent his English opponent General George Eliott a gift of fruits, vegetables and game, along with some ice, which he presumed "will not be disagreeable in the excessive heat of this climate at this season of the year." He expressed his "pleasure to which I look forward of becoming your friend, after I shall have learned to render myself worthy of the honour, by facing you as an enemy." Five years later, when his old adversary Eliott was promoted to the peerage and became Lord Heathfield, Crillon wrote to his "dear and respectable enemy", whom he now considered a friend, to offer his congratulations.
Crillon married three times and had four children. His first wife, whom he married on 1 February 1742, was Françoise-Marie-Elizabeth Couvay, with whom he had two children: Louis-Alexandre-Nolasque-Félix de Balbe Berton, who became the 5th Duke of Crillon on his father's death and had a distinguished military career in his own right; and François-Félix Dorothée. His second wife, whom he married on 2 August 1764, was Florence-Radagonde-Louise-Eléonore-Julie Bruneau de la Rabatelière, who died without issue. His third wife, Josephe-Anathase-Roman-Garmon Spinosa de Los-Monteras, bore him two more children: Louis-Antoine-François de Paule, who became the 2nd Duke of Mahon, and Marie-Thérèse-Virginie-Françoise de Paul. He died on 5 April 1796 in Madrid.

William Jay Bolton

William Jay Bolton (31 August 1816 – 1884) was the first artist in the United States to design and manufacture figural stained glass windows.
Biography.
Bolton was born in Bath, Somerset, England and was the second son of a wealthy merchant, Robert Bolton, of Savannah, Georgia, who later became an ordained minister and the founder of Christ Church in Pelham, New York. Robert Bolton married Anne Jay in 1810. She was the daughter of the Evangelical minister William Jay. When Bolton was growing up he often went with his grandfather on summer trips through the countryside making pencil drawings of the stained glass windows of the churches they visited. Bolton probably learned his early appreciation of art due to the guidance by his grandfather, William Jay. Jay was a mason's apprentice during the construction of Fonthill Abbey. He often went with his aunt Arabella Jay to King's College Chapel in Cambridge. Here he saw early sixteenth-century stained glass windows of the church. 
Bolton attended an Evangelical school in Mill Hill near London until he was 16. He then attended Cambridge University. He also briefly joined an engineering firm in Bath where he began painting in earnest. He first painted portraits of his family and friends. Bolton's parents and grandparents knew many famous artists including William Etty. Etty made two chalk drawings of baby Bolton. He also painted other Bolton family portraits. 
In 1836 the family moved to Westchester County, New York, to the town of Pelham. In Pelham Washington Irving, a neighbour and family friend, introduced Bolton to Samuel F. B. Morse. Around 1839 Bolton became a student of Morse at the National Academy of Design. In 1840 Bolton received first prize for his drawing of the Venus de' Medici from the Academy. 
In 1841 Bolton went to Europe where he saw masterpieces of art, mostly in Italy. Here he did many drawings and sketches of these and bought art for the family home. In 1842 Bolton returned to Pelham where he earnestly began his work in stained glass. Here he had a small shop at the rear of a house near the "Pelham Priory," the Gothic Revival family home in Pelham. The equipment he had to work with was sparse. He had a muffle kiln, which was used for firing his work after he painted details on the coloured glass. Bolton's younger brother John (1818–1898) assisted him in making and designing stained glass.
Bolton's first attempts at stained glass were windows for "The Priory", the family home. His first major window, a large "Adoration of the Magi", was for the family church where his father was rector, Christ Church at Pelham. It was completed by the time of its consecration on 15 September 1843 and represents the first figural stained glass window made in the United States. It is similar in design to a subject in a sixteenth-century window at St. Martin's Church in Liege, Belgium, which Bolton most likely had seen in his travels some two years earlier. This work lead up to his finest work, at the Holy Trinity Church in Brooklyn, New York.
Bolton went to England around 1845 and opened a glass staining studio in Cambridge. After the death of his first wife, he ceased his stained glass work and became an ordained minister in an Anglican church around 1853. He was vicar of Stratford East church in London from 1866 to 1881. He was also associated with St. James Church in Bath from 1881 to 1884. He died in Bath in 1884.

<doc id="20070228" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20070228" title="Pittsburgh Bankers">
Pittsburgh Bankers

The Pittsburgh Bankers were one of the earliest professional ice hockey clubs. The club was based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and was a member of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, the first league to openly hire hockey players, from 1900–1904 and 1907-1909. The team played all of its games at the Duquesne Gardens, and was involved, in the first known trade of professional hockey players.
History.
First title: 1902.
In 1902, the Bankers signed Hod Stuart to a professional contract; this was disputed between the Bankers and the Pittsburgh Victorias, who also claimed him. Eventually the Bankers won the dispute and kept Stuart, who was considered, in certain hockey circles, to be the “greatest hockey player in the world." Hod was offered a salary of US$15–20 per week, plus steady income from a day job in Pittsburgh. Stuart scored seven goals and had eight assists and was named the best cover-point in the league in 1903. The Bankers claimed their first WPHL title that season and faced off against the Portage Lakes Hockey Club, located in Houghton, Michigan for the title of top professional team in the United States. The winner of that series is unclear since Portage Lakes would win two of the four games and tie a third and the Bankers claimed the edge in total goals, 11-6. Another of the era's stars, Charlie Liffiton, joined the Bankers in 1902 to help the club win its first title. Over his two seasons with the club, Liffiton reportedly scored three goals in four playoff matches.
Consolidated into the IPHL.
The following season, the Bankers saw their star player, Hod Stuart, leave the team to join the Portage Lakes Hockey Club. In fact as Portage Lakes continued to play professional exhibition games, the team raided all of the WPHL teams for their key players. The Bankers', Charlie Liffiton, was offered 1350 to play for the Portage Lakes club for the remainder of the season, making him the era's highest paid player. The WPHL and the Bankers disappeared for the following season so that the WPHL could consolidate into the Pittsburgh Professionals and begin playing in the International Professional Hockey League. The idea for the new league was the idea of James R. Dee, a Houghton businessman, who came up with the idea after watching the Bankers and Portage Lakes play in 1904. Several Bankers' players, such as Lorne Campbell and Hod Stuart played for the Pittsburgh Professionals. Meanwhile other Bankers players, like Charlie Liffiton, played for Portage Lakes.
Revived and quick demise.
The WPHL, along with the Pittsburgh Bankers was revived in for the 1907-08 season, once the IPHL folded. On January 28, 1908, the Bankers might have been the first team to trade professional hockey players. According to the deal, the Pittsburgh Pirates sent Jim MacKay, Edgar Dey and Dunc Taylor to the Bankers for Josephy Donnelly, Cliff Bennest and a player named "McGuire". The Bankers would go on to win their second league title in 1907-08. The Bankers then played a "World's Series" with the Montreal Wanderers. The Wanderers won the series two games to one.
The following season saw future Stanley Cup winner Skene Ronan made his professional hockey debut with the Bankers, however Ronan would later break his contract to leave the team and play with the Toronto Professionals. Meanwhile future Hall of Famer, Alf Smith returned to the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League and played for the Bankers and the Pittsburgh Duquesne before he was suspended from the two teams for rough play.
However the defection of star Bankers players such as Ronan, Tommy Smith, Harry Smith and Edgar Dey were now common in the WPHL. The newly revived league, could no longer rely on salaries as novelty to attract Canadian talent, since professionalism had spread into Canada. Many players signed up, particular since the WPHL played on the Duquesne Gardens' artificial ice and was not dependent on cold weather to provide a naturally frozen surface, however as winter began and Canadian rinks became available, the players would just flock north to teams closer to home. This jumping effected all of the league's teams. Once the Pittsburgh Lyceum team folded on December 23, it was decided to discontinue the WPHL after the season. The Bankers ended their final season, by winning the final WPHL championship title and typing the Pittsburgh Athletic Club for the most titles won at 3 each.
Prominent players.
The following members of the Bankers became enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame:

Adélaïde Moundélé-Ngollo

Yvonne Adélaïde Moundélé-Ngollo (born 1944) is a Congolese politician who has served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises since 2007. She was previously Director-General of "Hydro-Congo" from 1998 to 1999 and Minister of Trade from 2002 to 2007.
Political career.
Moundélé-Ngollo was born in Brazzaville. She is a daughter of Édouard Mougany, who was a member of the National Assembly and an ally of President Fulbert Youlou. Her first husband was Ange Diawara, a military officer and early leader of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT) who was executed in 1973 for his role in a coup plot. She later married another politician, Benoît Moundélé-Ngollo, who served as a government minister, as Mayor of Brazzaville, and as Prefect of Brazzaville.
After holding high-level posts at "Hydro-Congo", the national oil exploration and exploitation company (including the post of Director of the Department of Studies and Planning from 1986 to 1994), Moundélé-Ngollo was an Adviser to the Minister of Hydrocarbons from 1994 to 1998. She also attended the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women as a delegate from Congo-Brazzaville in September 1995. Moundélé-Ngollo was the Director-General of "Hydro-Congo" from December 1998 to December 1999. She later became a member of the National Executive Bureau of Club 2002, which supports President Denis Sassou Nguesso and is led by his nephew, Willy Sassou Nguesso.
After the May–June 2002 parliamentary election, Moundélé-Ngollo was appointed as Minister of Trade, Consumption, and Supplies on 18 August 2002, and she succeeded Pierre-Damien Boussoukou Boumba in that position on 21 August. In late 2002 and early 2003, she played a key role in peace initiatives regarding the Ninja rebellion, led by Pasteur Ntoumi; a peace agreement was signed on 17 March 2003, and she became a member of the Monitoring Committee of the Convention for Peace and National Reconstruction.
In the June–August 2007 parliamentary election, Moundélé-Ngollo was elected to the National Assembly as the Club 2002 candidate in the first constituency of Mindouli, located in the Pool Region. After placing second with 42.10% of the vote in the first round, she faced Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI) candidate Jean-Claude Massoba in the second round and won the seat. After the election, she was moved from her position as Minister of Trade, Consumption, and Supplies to that of Minister of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, in charge of the Craft Industry, on 30 December 2007. Her alternate, Auguste Mpassi-Mouba, took up her seat in the National Assembly.
Mpassi-Mouba died on 16 October 2009, thereby leaving the seat for Mindouli 1 vacant. To resume her seat in the National Assembly, it would have been necessary for Moundélé-Ngollo to resign from the government, and she apparently did not want to do so; consequently, a by-election was called for July 2010 to replace Mpassi-Mouba. Constitutionally, the matter was considered somewhat unclear, as the by-election was being called to replace an alternate while the titular deputy was still alive. Moundélé-Ngollo stood again as a candidate in the by-election; because it was understood that she would remain in the government, her alternate was effectively the real candidate.

Robert Alexander Cameron

Robert Alexander Cameron (February 22, 1828 – March 15, 1894) was an American soldier and newspaper publisher. He served as a Union general during the American Civil War. During the war he was made a brigadier general and after the war was appointed a brevet major general. After the war he was heavily involved in developing farms in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Early life and career.
Cameron was born in Brooklyn, New York. He moved with his parents to Valparaiso, Indiana in the early 1842, where he attended the local public schools. Cameron graduated from Indiana Medical College in 1849, and also attended Rush Medical College in Chicago, however he soon gave up his medical studies. 
In 1857, Cameron bought and began publishing the Valparaiso "Republican", a local newspaper. He also served as a Republican delegate to their 1860 convention in Chicago, supporting the campaign of Abraham Lincoln for U.S. President.
Civil War service.
When the American Civil War began, Cameron was a doctor in practice at Valparaiso and a member of the Indiana House of Representatives. He enlisted in the 9th Indiana, a three month regiment, and was elected captain on April 23, 1861. With the 9th, Cameron saw service in the Western Virginia Campaigns. After those three months were up, Cameron re-enlisted for the duration of hostilities and was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 19th Indiana Infantry on July 29. 
In September 1861, Cameron and the 19th Indiana fought in a skirmish at Chain Bridge, one of the bridges over the Potomac River leading into Washington, D.C. After the action Col. Solomon Meredith, Cameron's brigade commander, thought highly of his performance, stating that he "rode the lines giving orders and maintaining a calmness that was not even shattered when the concussion of a shell brought his horse to its knees." Despite this praise, Cameron was not able to get along with Meredith, and asked Indiana governor Oliver Morton to be removed from the 19th and assigned elsewhere. His request would be granted early in the following year.
On February 3, 1862, Cameron was transferred to the 34th Indiana, and Cameron and the 34th fought in Missouri at the action near New Madrid and the following Battle of Island Number Ten that February to April. He also participated in the capture of Memphis, Tennessee, on June 6. Cameron was then promoted to colonel and given command of the 34th, both on June 15. 
With his regiment Cameron participated in the 1863 Vicksburg Campaign, where he was slightly wounded in his eyes during the Battle of Port Gibson on May 1. Cameron was promoted to brigadier general in the Union Army on August 11, 1863. After several stints of brigade command in late 1863 and 1864, he led a division of the XIII Corps during the 1864 Red River Campaign. During the Battle of Mansfield in Louisiana on April 8, Cameron's men attempted to reinforce the crumbling Union line around 5 p.m., but were forced back when it finally broke near 6 p.m.
Cameron finished the war in district command in the Department of the Gulf at Thibodaux, Louisiana. On March 13, 1865, he was appointed a brevet major general in the Union Army, and he resigned his commission soon after on June 22.
Postbellum.
Following the war, Cameron headed to the Western United States and was active in establishing farm colonies in Colorado, and was also prominent in the politics and the economic development of the former territory. In 1870 Cameron was influential in founding of Greeley, and was elected president of Greeley’s board of trustees in 1871. He was lured away by William Jackson Palmer to become superintendent of a new colony, which later would grow into the city of Colorado Springs. Cameron also took part in an attempt to establish Fort Collins. 
Cameron then moved to San Francisco, California, where he stayed there for few years before returning to Colorado to serve as a postal clerk in Denver. From 1885–87, he served as warden of Colorado State Penitentiary. In the spring of 1894 Cameron died on his farm near Cañon City, Colorado, and is buried there.
Legacy.
Camerons Cone is located in Pike National Forest, about from Colorado Springs, Colorado, and was named for Robert Alexander Cameron. When originally dedicated, the summit was called Cameron's Cone.

Trade Union Act 1871

Trade Union Act 1871 (34 & 35 Vict c 31) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which legalised trade unions for the first time in the United Kingdom. This was one of the founding pieces of legislation in UK labour law, though it has today been superseded by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.
Background.
The Conservative Prime Minister, the Earl of Derby, set up a "Royal Commission on Trade Unions" in 1867. One worker representatives was on the commission, a Mr Frederic Harrison, who prepared union witnesses. Robert Applegarth from the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners who was a union observer of the proceedings.
The majority report of the Commission was hostile to the idea of decriminalising trade unions. Frederic Harrison, Thomas Hughes and the Earl of Lichfield produced their own minority report, recommending the following changes in the law.
When William Ewart Gladstone's new government came to power, the Trade Union Congress campaigned for the minority report, made under the leadership of Sir William Erle, to be adopted. It was successful.
In its passage through Parliament, Mr Bruce introduced the First Reading of the Bill, quoting the Minority Report.
Amendments and repeal.
However the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871 was passed at the same time, which made picketing illegal. This was not repealed until the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875.
The Act was fully repealed by the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974.

Charles de Bernard de Marigny

Charles-René-Louis, vicomte de Bernard de Marigny (1 February 1740, Sées - 25 July 1816, Brest) was a French vice admiral, grand-cross of the ordre de Saint-Louis and commander of the Brest fleet.
Biography.
Born the fourth boy of an eight-child old but poor family from Normandy, Marigny was destined to an ecclesiastic career, and was soon sent to Sées seminary. However, his temperament did inclined- him more to adventure, and at age 14, he escaped the seminary to find refuge by his older brother who served with the "gardes de la marine" in Rochefort.
Marigny broke relations with his father and studied to enter the "gardes de la marine" as well. He was admitted in 1754 and was appointed to the frigate "Valeur" the next year for a 14-month campaign. He suffered from acute sea sickness, but eventually managed to overcome this issue.
Promoted to ensign in 1757, Marigny was appointed to the corvette "Zéphir", and later to the 74-gun "Actif", taking part in a campaign to India.
After 40 months, Marigny returned to France on "Zodiaque", and served successively on "Glorieux", "Minotaure", "Union", the frigate " Légère" and the fluyt "Garonne". He cruised off Santo Domingo, off Africa, Portugal and India. In 1767, he was promoted to lieutenant and sent in a survey mission on the costs of India. After an eight-month journey, he returned to France with a mémoire for the Ministry of the Navy.
In 1770, Marigny was given command of the scow "Dorade", ferrying ammunition from Bayonne to Rochefort. After "Dorade" was decommissioned, Marigny was appointed to the harbour of Brest.
In 1775, Marigny was awarded the Order of Saint Louis, and given command of the corvette "Serin" and of the station of Windward Islands.
Poisonned by sleeping on his freshly repainted ship, Marigny fell ill for one year and had to resign his command. Once cured, he was given command of the corvette "Étourdie", cruising in the Channel for 6 months.
In late 1777, he was appointed to the frigate "Belle Poule" and tasked with ferrying Benjamin Franklin to the Americas. Frankly was returning from a trip to France in which he had requested French support on behalf of the Congress.
On 7 January 1778, "Belle Poulle" was intercepted by HMS "Hector" and HMS "Courageux" at 45° 46 N 8° W. The ships manoeuvered as to take "Belle Poule" in a crossfire and demanded that Marigny put a boat to sea, which he refused. A British ship then sent a boat and asked ""Who are you, where do you come from, where are you sailing?"", to which Marigny replied:
After some negotiation, the British officers stated that he had confused "Belle Poule" for a ship of the revolted colonies masquerading as a French ship.
As freemason, Charles de Bernard de Marigny has been worshipful master of his lodge, l'Heureuse rencontre, in Brest

Chuck Drulis

Charles John Drulis (March 8, 1918 – August 23, 1972) was an American football player and coach born in Girardville, Pennsylvania. He attended Temple University and played seven seasons in the National Football League. [http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DrulCh20.htm] Drulis, along with his brothers Joe and Albert, who also played in the NFL, was elected into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame.
Drulis made his professional debut in the NFL in 1942 with the Chicago Bears but spent the next two-and-a-half seasons in military service during World War II. He returned to the Bears in 1945 and played there until 1949. Drulis spent his final season with the Green Bay Packers. [http://www.nfl.com/players/chuckdrulis/profile?id=DRU276861]
Drulis went on to spend many years as a defensive assistant. During his tenure as secondary coach of the St. Louis Cardinals, Drulis devised a play that called for one of the safeties to take part in a blitz, code-named "Wildcat." He believed this would result in severe pressure on the quarterback, since a blitz by a defensive back is not usually anticipated. However, at first he didn't think he had a player with the athleticism to run the play. That changed during training camp in , when the Cardinals signed a cornerback from Utah named Larry Wilson. Drulis believed he'd found the player he needed for his scheme, and persuaded the Cardinals to convert Wilson to free safety. Largely due to the play, Wilson blossomed into one of the greatest defensive players in NFL history, and became so identified with it that "Wildcat" became his nickname.
After Pop Ivy resigned late in the 1961 season, Drulis shared head coaching duties with fellow assistant coaches Ray Prochaska and Ray Willsey. Under the trio's guidance, the team won its last two games. [http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/DrulCh0.htm]

Urraca of Zamora

Urraca (1033/4 – 1101) was a Leónese "infanta", one of the five children of Ferdinand I the Great, who received the city of Zamora as her inheritance and exercised palatine authority in it. Her story was romanticized in the "cantar de gesta" called the "Cantar de Mio Cid", and Robert Southey's "Chronicle of the Cid".
Life.
Before his death in 1065, Ferdinand divided his widespread conquests in central Spain between his five children, charging them to live at peace with one another. Ferdinand's oldest son Sancho II of Castile (the Strong) received Castile and the tribute from Zaragoza; Alfonso VI (the Brave) received León and the tribute from Toledo; and García received Galicia. His daughters, Elvira and Urraca, received Toro and Zamora respectively.
Sancho however resolved to rule over his father's entire kingdom and made war on his siblings. By 1072, Sancho had overthrown his youngest brother Garcia, and forced his other brother Alfonso to flee to his Moorish vassal city of Toledo. Toro, the city of Sancho's sister Elvira, fell easily. But in a siege of Urraca's better-defended city of Zamora, King Sancho was stalled, and was then mysteriously assassinated on 7 October 1072. It was widely suspected that the assassination was a result of a pact between Alfonso and Urraca. The Chronicle of the Cid, purportedly written by one of the Cid's followers, states that the assassin was a nobleman of Zamora, who then received sanctuary in the city. The chronicle is careful not to place any direct blame on Alfonso or Urraca, just as it takes pains to stress that the participation of the Cid at the siege of Zamora was involuntary and supposedly forced on him by King Sancho.
The Castilian nobility, however, were highly suspicious of both Urraca and Alfonso, and maintained the siege of Zamora for a period after Sancho's death. In the absence of Sancho, however, their siege was pointless. According to the chronicle, the guilt of Zamora was decided by a trial by combat, which proved inconclusive. Urraca sent summonses to the nobles of Sancho's dominions, calling on them to gather, and Alfonso was grudgingly acknowledged as heir to all of the Castilian realm as well as León. Suspicion, however, remained and, led by the Cid and a dozen "oath-helpers," the nobles forced Alfonso to swear to his innocence publicly in front of St. Gadea's Church in Burgos. From this incident dated Alfonso's later antagonism to the Cid.
The Chronicle of the Cid states that in his early years as King, Alfonso followed Urraca's advice in all respects. There were even rumors of an incestuous relationship between the pair. Urraca maintained her rule over Zamora following Alfonso's succession to the Castilian throne. In her later years she gradually gave up her governing duties, finally retiring to a monastery in Leon, where she died in 1101. She is interred in the Chapel of the Kings at the Basílica of San Isidoro of León.
Following the death of his son, Sancho, fighting Muslim forces, Alfonso VI was eventually succeeded by his daughter, Queen Urraca of León.
Death and burial.
At the end of her life, she retired to a monastery where Leon remained until her death in 1101, one being buried in The Royal Pantheon in Basilica of San Isidoro where lie her parents and two siblings, King García of Galicia and Infanta Elvira of Toro.
In the tomb stone in which were deposited the remains of the infanta was carved the following epitaph Latino:
H. R. DOMNA URRACA REGINA DE ZAMORA, FILIA REGIS MAGNI FERDINANDI. HAEC AMPLIFICAVIT ECCLESIAM ISTAM, ET MULTIS MUNERIBUS DITAVIT. ET QUIA BEATUM ISIDORUM SUPER OMNIA DILIGEBAT. EJUS SERVITIO SUBJUGAVIT. OBIIT ERA MCXXXVIIII...NOBILIS URRACA JACET HOC TUMULO TUMULATA HESPERIAEQUE DECUS HEU TENET HIC LOCULUS HAEC FUIT OPTANDI PROLES REGIS FREDENANDI. AST REGINA FUIT SANCTIA QUAE GENUIT CENTIES UNDECIES SOL VOLVERAT ET SEMEL ANNUM CARNE QUOD OBTECTUS SPONTE.
Literature and film.
In the poetic legend, Dona Urraca is the wronged "infanta", watching Sancho and the Cid despoil her lands from the battlements of her castle shortly before Sancho is murdered. Her brother Alfonso is her loyal and chivalrous defender.
The Hollywood film "El Cid" largely follows the narrative of the Chronicle and the poetic epics, adding to the character of the Infanta a spurned woman role scheming against the Cid, once she seems rejected by him; however it omits the story that Urraca and Rodrigo grew up as close companions in Zamora and maybe more is behind omitted. And it stretches the psychological card that as older and provoking sister she plays between her brothers Alfonso and Sancho's quarrels for her city and herself. Later in the film, after the death of the haughty older brother Sancho, she focuses her favours to extract from Alfonso compensation to her own grudges with Ruy Diaz. For some reason the film wrongly makes Urraca the ruler of Calahorra, rather than Zamora. Urraca is portrayed by the French actress Geneviève Page.

Ukrani

The Ukrani (, ) were a West Slavic Polabian tribe in the Uckermark ("terra U(c)kera", "Uckerland") from the 6th–12th centuries. Their settlement area was centered around the lakes Oberuckersee and Unteruckersee at the spring of the Uecker River. In this region, burghs with a proto-town suburbium were set up at "Drense" and on an isle in Lake Oberuckersee (near modern Prenzlau).
In 954, Margrave Gero of the Saxon Eastern March (the marca Geronis), aided by Holy Roman Emperor Otto I's son-in-law, Conrad of Lorraine, launched a successful campaign to subdue the Ukrani, who had come in reach of the Holy Roman Empire's Northern March after the 929 Battle of Lenzen. After the 983 revolt of the Obodrites and Lutici, the area became independent again, yet remained under permanent military pressure, especially from Poland and the Holy Roman Empire.

Justin Marler (born July 29, 1972, in Chico, California) is an American musician and author. He is known for being a founding member of the seminal doom metal band Sleep, and for leaving a burgeoning career in music to become a monk in an Eastern Orthodox monastery. In 1990 Justin joined the members of a little-known band called Asbestos Death (Al Cisneros, Chris Hakius and Matt Pike) and they renamed the band Sleep. Soon after recording their first full length record, Volume One, Justin Marler vanished, while Sleep went on to become metal icons. 
Marler turned up at St. Herman of Alaska Monastery in northern California and later was transferred to a monastery on a nearly deserted island in Alaska. During his seven-year stint as a monk he founded the widely distributed Zine titled Death To The World. The zine had a considerable impact on youth counterculture during the mid to late 1990s, which caught the attention of mainstream press, and quickly led to the release of his first book, "Youth of the Apocalypse", (co-authored with a fellow monastic). In 1999, Justin Marler left his reclusive life in the monastery and returned to California where he restarted his music career, with former Sleep bandmate Chris Hakius, as the lead singer for the alternative band "The Sabians". Marler moved to Austin, Texas in 2005, and is a musician and publishing author. Marler is active in the Austin music scene with current band "Shiny Empire".

New Jersey, Indiana and Illinois Railroad

Overview.
The NJI&I was originally created by the Singer Sewing Machine Company in order to transport their products from South Bend, IN, to a connection with the Wabash Railroad in Pine, Indiana. The line began service in 1905 and officially operated on only 11.4 miles of track. The line ran between South Bend and Pine, Indiana, where it met the Wabash Railroad. 
Up until and through World War I the line offered two passenger trains round trip daily to Detroit. In the 1930s passenger service was discontinued. The Wabash had purchased the line in 1926 but continued to operate it as a separate railroad. 
The major customers included Singer Manufacturing and The Studebaker Company. The NJI&I continued in service until 1982 when the Norfork Southern absorbed the line. Despite both manufacturers going out of business in the early 1960s and early 1970s, the line continued to operate for several other smaller customers. 
The name is derived from the three states Singer had plants in at the time of charter. The railroad was eventually taken over by the Wabash and operated through the Norfolk and Western takeover. The line continued to service several customers until the NS-Conrail takeover allowed NS to access their customers via the former New York Central Chicago line. The line was abandoned and removed in the late 1990s.
Rolling stock.
NJI&I was a steam railroad until the late 1940s. The line was dieselized with an Alco S1 and a competing EMD switcher. Currently operations are handled by standard Norfolk Southern EMD geeps typical to Class I local power system-wide.
Buildings and structures.
NJI&I is unique in having most of the main line torn up but many significant structures remaining. The headquarters at 1508 W. Western Avenue in South Bend still stands and is used as a daycare. The two stall roundhouse remains on Olive Street and is easily accessible for pictures, although trespassing is discouraged. The former Singer plant is no longer connected by rail but is still standing as a senior citizen's home on Western Avenue. This plant was the main reason for creation of NJI&I.
Current operations.
NS operates locals to customers along the former NYC Kankakee Belt Line and NJI&I from the office along the Kankakee Belt beneath the overpass at Sample and Olive Streets in South Bend. Customers include Steel Warehouse (steel coils) and an Ethanol plant (corn) as well as a scrap yard. Were the former PRR Vandalia line to be active still (tracks remain) this local would service those customers too. The PRR Vandalia line is remaining from a connection with NJI&I down to Eckman Street, site of former Sibley Foundry. The spur to Sibley is no longer.

Mennonites in France

The Mennonites in France are religious descendents of the Anabaptist movement. Anabaptists first appeared in the east of France during the early years of the Protestant Reformation. Strasbourg was a haven for all kinds of religious dissidents during this period. From 1528 to 1532, Pilgram Marpeck lived in Strasbourg, serving for two years as a timber supervisor and engineer, before he was expelled from the city because of his Anabaptist activity. After opposition from reformers such as Martin Bucer, all known Anabaptists were expelled from the city (Edict of 16 February 1534). But 20 years later they were again active in Strasbourg. By 1556 there was an Anabaptist congregation of about one hundred in the city. Strasbourg become a favourite location for conferences of Anabaptist ministers, with gatherings being held in 1554, 1555, 1557, 1568, 1592, and 1607. The 1554 conference was reputed to have been attended by 600 Anabaptists. As persecution continued, they tended more and more to live in the country, where there was a greater chance to live out their principles undisturbed. Their numbers were sharply reduced by emigration to America. Repeated attempts were made to expel them from Alsace.
In the 20th century, the French Mennonite churches, which are autonomous, all identify themselves with the evangelical wing of Protestantism. They have formed their own association, the "Association des Églises Évangéliques Mennonites de France (AEEMF)", which is in dialogue with the main Protestant groupings in France. The AEEMF lists 30 assemblies, mostly in Eastern France, the biggest concentration being in Alsace (Department 68, Haut-Rhin). Only seven of these assemblies have salaried pastors. Latest estimates put the number of French Mennonites at 2000-2400. The Mennonite World Conference has a seat in Strasbourg.

Pittsburgh Pirates (WPHL)

The Pittsburgh Pirates were an early professional ice hockey club based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and were members of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League for the 1908 WPHL season. The team, and the league, played all of their games at the Duquesne Gardens. The Pirates are best known for being involved in the first known trade of professional hockey players.
History.
When the WPHL was revived in 1907, the only two original teams to return to the league after operations were suspended after the 1903-04 season were the Pittsburgh Athletic Club and the Pittsburgh Bankers. Two new teams were needed to get the league back to its original number of four teams. One of the teams to enter the league in 1907 was the Pittsburgh Lyceum, and the other was the Pirates. The Pirates entered the league loaded with professional players like Dunc Taylor, Ed Robitaille, Ray Robinson, Harry McRobie, Edgar Dey, Charlie Mason and goaltender Jim MacKay.
After the 1902 season, the WPHL became the first league to openly hire hockey players. Many of the athletes in the WPHL were Canadians who were drawn to Pittsburgh because of the Duquesne Gardens, which was one of the few arenas in North America that had an artificial ice rink. To their credit, the Pirates might have been the first team to trade professional hockey players. According to the deal, the Pittsburgh Pirates sent Jim MacKay, Edgar Dey and Dunc Taylor to the Pittsburgh Bankers for Josephy Donnelly, Cliff Bennest and a player named "McGuire" on January 28, 1908. The Pirates played only one year in the WPHL. They ended their only season with a record of 5 wins, 10 losses, and 2 ties.

Fresh Talent Initiative

The Fresh Talent Initiative is a Scottish Government policy framework to encourage people to settle in Scotland. The initiative was launched in February 2004 by then First Minister, Jack McConnell as a way of countering the 'biggest challenge facing Scotland' of its falling population. 
Since immigration is a matter reserved to the UK parliament in the legislation that established the Scottish parliament in 1999 (the Scotland Act 1998), agreement had to be obtained from the Home Office for a key part of the initiative: to allow overseas graduates from Scottish universities, who express the intention of living and working in Scotland, to stay on for two years following graduation to seek employment. The Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme was up and running by summer 2005, applying to those who graduated that year.
Opposition towards the scheme was voiced by some English universities which felt that the scheme gave Scottish universities a competitive advantage in terms of attracting students from overseas.
The Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme was subsumed into the UK immigration system on 29th June, 2008 when the UK government brought in a new points based immigration scheme.

1936–37 Montreal Canadiens season

The 1936–37 Montreal Canadiens season was the team's 28th season of play. After coach Cecil Hart and Howie Morenz returned to the club, the Canadiens placed first in the Canadian Division and qualified for the playoffs. Montreal met and lost to eventual Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings in the semi-finals.
Regular season.
The Montreal Canadiens had hit the bottom in 1935–36, and Babe Siebert was obtained to shore up the defence. Cecil Hart was rehired as coach. Hart placed a condition on his returning to the club, that former star Howie Morenz would return to the club. After being traded to Chicago and from there to New York, Morenz had struggled and the Rangers were willing trade partners for Morenz. Goalie George Hainsworth also returned to the Canadiens, signed as a free agent.
The Canadiens went from last to first in the Canadian Division. Morenz was just hitting his stride in January 1937, when tragedy struck. On one of his hurtling rushes, he was being checked by Earl Seibert of Chicago when his left skate got caught in the dasher of the end boards, and Morenz suffered a badly fractured leg. After suffering a nervous breakdown worrying about if he'd be able to come back, more bad luck occurred. On March 8, 1937, X-rays revealed that Howie had blood clots in his healing leg. An operation was scheduled for the next day, but when Howie ate a light supper and told the nurse he wanted to rest, in falling asleep his pallor suddenly changed and the nurse knew something was wrong. A blood clot had stopped his heart, and attempts to revive Howie failed. News of Morenz's death shocked the hockey world, and thousands filed past his bier, many in tears, to pay their last respects.
Playoffs.
As champions of the Canadian division, the Canadiens proceeded directly to the semi-final against the Detroit Red Wings. Montreal lost the best-of-five series 3–2.

Henry Melville Whitney

Henry Melville Whitney (October 22, 1839 - January 25, 1923) was an American industrialist, the founder of the West End Street Railway Company of Boston, Massachusetts, and later the Dominion Coal Company Ltd. and the Dominion Iron and Steel Company Ltd. of Sydney, Nova Scotia. He was also president of the Metropolitan Steamship Company, long an important transportation link between Boston and New York City.
Early life.
Henry Whitney was born at Conway, Massachusetts, of Puritan stock. The family were descended from John Whitney of London, who settled in 1635 at Watertown, Massachusetts. Henry Whitney's father was Brigadier General James Scollay Whitney; his mother, Laurinda Collins, was a descendant of William Bradford. Henry had a well known younger brother, the financier William Collins Whitney, who served as Secretary of the Navy in the first administration (1885–89) of President Grover Cleveland. His sister Lucy Collins "Lily" Whitney married Charles T. Barney, who became the president of the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Another sister, Susan Collins Whitney, married Henry F. Dimock. 
Educated at Williston Seminary, East Hampton, Massachusetts, Whitney was a personally pleasant and genial man who had hearing difficulties from childhood. He began his business career as a clerk in a bank in Conway in 1856. In 1859 he went to Boston, where he was a clerk in the Bank of Mutual Redemption. He then worked as a clerk in the office of the navy agent at the Boston Custom House in 1860-61. Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Whitney went to New York City and engaged in the shipping business.
In 1866 Whitney returned to Boston and was appointed agent of the Metropolitan Steamship Company, of which his father was president. This concern operated steamships on the "outside line" between Boston and New York around Cape Cod. 
On October 3, 1878, Whitney married Margaret F. Green of Brookline, Massachusetts. Residing in Brookline, the couple were the parents of one son and four daughters.
Shipping and industral interests.
Upon his father's death on October 24, 1878, Whitney was elected his successor as president of the Metropolitan Steamship Company, retaining the position of agent at Boston.
Whitney established the West End Street Railway Company with himself as president in 1886 as a combination of the five street railways of the Boston area. He introduced the use of electricity as the road's motive power in 1888, replacing its 10,000 horses, and by 1900 it comprised a rapid transit system second to none.
In 1889 Whitney and Frederick Stark Pearson, chief engineer of the West End Street Railway Company, formed the Whitney coal syndicate with Benjamin Franklin Pearson of the People's Heat and Light Company of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The group purchased one coal mine and obtained options on others south of Sydney in eastern Cape Breton Island. Premier William Stevens Fielding and the Liberal provincial administration favored Whitney's entry into the coal business because his steamships and street-railway electric generators consumed large quantities of coal. The Whitney syndicate was offered an unprecedented 99-year lease at a fixed royalty; the group exercised its options, acquiring most of the existing bituminous coal mines of eastern Cape Breton Island and co-opting such local figures as John Stewart McLennan and David MacKeen. This process took some months, and Whitney was not ready to consolidate operations at Sydney until early 1893.
Meanwhile, in June 1890 the Metropolitan Steamship Company placed the new iron steamer "H.M. Whitney" in service between Boston and New York. The 2,706-ton, 288-foot vessel was built by William Cramp and Sons at Philadelphia. The "H.M. Whitney" was flagship of the Metropolitan fleet until she was run down and sunk by the steamer "Ottoman" in Boston harbor on September 28, 1892. No lives were lost, and the "H.M. Whitney" was later refloated and, after reconditioning, returned to service.
On February 1, 1893, the Dominion Coal Company Ltd. (DOMCO) was incorporated with Whitney as president, B.F. Pearson as secretary and F.S. Pearson as chief engineer. Early investors in this enterprise included Whitney's younger brother, William C. Whitney; his brothers-in-law, Henry F. Dimock and Charles T. Barney; and Almeric H. Paget, who later married William's daughter Pauline. 
The new company quickly effected numerous efficiencies and improvements, and production was quadrupled within a decade. There were, however, costly mistakes, prominent among them the tendency to become locked into low-price contracts (such as to Whitney's companies), thus missing a large market at higher prices. By 1901 some 90 per cent of its output was committed to such low-price contracts. The company made a large public offering of stock, which tumbled in price when Whitney failed to get the American import duty on coal removed or at least reduced.
Similar problems were encountered by People's Heat and Light after it was incorporated in 1893 with Whitney as president and B.F. Pearson as secretary. Although People's Heat and Light had the advantage of low-cost coal, it was plagued by substandard materials, limited technical experience, and stock-market speculations, with the result that the company, in the words of Kyle Jolliffe, "collapsed under the heavy weight of its own debts" in 1902. 
Back in Boston, Whitney established the New England Gas and Coke Company for the purpose of manufacturing and distributing illuminating gas and railroad-grade coke. In January 1896 Whitney announced the organization of the Massachusetts Pipe Line Gas Company. The new concern would purchase gas from New England Gas and Coke, which in turn purchased its raw material from DOMCO. A new contract between DOMCO and New England Gas and Coke was signed on September 30, 1897, and by mid-1899 a new gas plant was in operation in Everett, Massachusetts. The arrangement led to the unfortunate public perception that the contract had been intended to enhance the value of the companies' stock.
Whitney expanded operations at Sydney with the organization in March 1899 of the Dominion Iron and Steel Company Ltd. (DISCO), which had financial backing in both Canada and the United States. Whitney was joined in the new enterprise by his long-time business friends - F.S. Pearson, B.F. Pearson, W.C. Whitney, C.T. Barney, H.F. Dimock, A.H. Paget and J.S. McLennan. The promise of federal bounties, together with concessions from the Liberal provincial administration of Premier George Henry Murray, enabled DISCO to begin work in June 1899 on the largest integrated steel mill in the British Empire. Located on the south side of Sydney Harbour, which Whitney said offered more advantages than anywhere else in the world, the mill was completed in 1901. Iron ore was mined by DISCO on Bell Island in Newfoundland and shipped to Sydney. 
Competitors in Britain, France, Germany and the United States were initially concerned. However, continuing problems of management and cost control led to Whatney's early withdrawal from the project. Later in 1901, Whitney and his associates sold majority control of DOMCO to James Ross of Montreal and their minority share of DISCO to Ross and several other Canadian interests. Whitney resigned as president of DISCO in 1902 and as a member of the DOMCO board in December 1903. Although he remained on the DISCO board until 1909, his focus was redirected to New England. James H. Plummer of Toronto gained control of DISCO in 1903 and DOMCO in 1910, placing them under the Dominion Steel Corporation in 1910.
Later life.
In 1904 Whitney was elected president of the Boston Chamber of Commerce. He also became interested in politics, promoting tariff reform and reciprocal trade agreements between Canada and the United States.
Charles W. Morse acquired control of the Metropolitan Steamship Company in 1906, placing it under the control of the Consolidated Steamship Company in January 1907. Morse crashed in the Panic of 1907, however. In 1911 the Metropolitan Steamship Company and the Maine Steamship Company (a New York City-Portland, Maine, operator) merged with the Eastern Steamship Company to form the Eastern Steamship Corporation. The line went into receivership in 1914 but emerged in 1917 as Eastern Steamship Lines. Service on Eastern's Metropolitan Line was maintained until 1941.
In the general election of November 5, 1907, Whitney was the Democratic candidate for governor of Massachusetts, but failed in his bid to unseat the Republican incumbent, Curtis Guild, Jr. Eleven days later, he represented the family at the funeral in New York City of his brother-in-law, Charles T. Barney, who had shot himself following the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust Company in the Panic of 1907.
Retiring from the boards of DISCO and the Metropolitan Steamship Company in 1909, Whitney lived in retirement at Brookline, where he died on January 25, 1923, at the age of 84. Largely because of the easy success of his younger brother, Whitney was generally supposed to be wealthy, but he had suffered losses from poor investments over a period of years. When the estate of "the supposed multi-millionaire", as "The New York Times" put it, was probated, it was found to be worth only $1,221.

Red Line (St. Louis MetroLink)

The Red Line of the St. Louis MetroLink is a light rail service operating between 28 stations in Greater St. Louis. It is the oldest and longest line in the system.
Route description.
The Red Line MetroLink alignment begins at Lambert St. Louis International Airport, making stops at the main and east terminal stations. It then proceeds through Kinloch before making a stop in North Hanley near Bel-Ridge. It makes 2 stops (UMSL North & South stations) at the University of Missouri St. Louis located in Normandy. After departing UMSL-North Station, the trains divert south onto the former Wabash/Norfolk & Western Railroad's Union Depot (U.D.) line that once brough passenger trains from Ferguson to Union Station. It further follows into 2 stops in Pagedale on St. Charles Rock Road and Wellston on Plymouth St., before crossing the St. Louis City/County boundary line at Skinker Boulevard; and making a stop at Delmar Boulevard, serving the popular Delmar Loop and located just below the original Wabash Railroad's Delmar Station building. The Red Line meets up with the Blue Line at the Forest Park-DeBaliviere station. From this station to the Fairview Heights station in Illinois, it creates the Shared Alignment track with the Blue Line. It terminates in Shiloh next to the Scott Air Force Base and close to the Mid-America Airport in Mascoutah.
Future extensions.
Some of these extensions will make the Red Line one of the longest light rail lines in the United States.
St. Clair County Extension.
St. Clair County Extension Phase 3 - Shiloh-Scott to MidAmerica Airport: the St. Clair County Extension Phase III will extend to MidAmerica Airport. Although design work for the extension has been completed, funding for construction hasn't been secured. It was originally part of the St. Clair County Extension Phase II project that extended to Shiloh-Scott, but was separated into its own project by the Federal Transit Administration due to projections of low ridership. If this extension had been built, it would have on this route alone.
Madison County Corridors.
Madison County Corridors - East St. Louis to Alton/Edwardsville: A study in 2005 was performed to investigate the potential costs, ridership, and impacts of extending Metrolink into Madison County, Illinois. According to the East-West Gateway Council of Governments, there are two recommended alignments for Madison County. Both of the alignments will start from the 5th & Missouri station out of East St Louis in St. Clair County to Granite City, Collinsville, Glen Carbon, Edwardsville, East Alton, Wood River, and Alton in Madison County, Illinois away. The alignments will junction off in Madison, Illinois into two alignments. In order to plan out the two alignments, Metro will have to collaborate with Madison County Transit.
St. Charles Corridor.
St. Charles Corridor - Lambert Airport to St. Charles County: Possible plans to expand MetroLink from Lambert Airport northwestward to St. Charles County were abandoned after St. Charles County voters rejected a sales tax in 1996 to fund an extension; subsequently, all MetroBus service was ended. If the extension was funded, the route would have used the Old St. Charles Bridge (now demolished) as a crossing over the Missouri River to the City of St. Charles, St. Peters, and O'Fallon. In the near future, it may be considered a potential alignment to study.

The Blue Line of the St. Louis MetroLink is a light rail service operating between 24 stations in Greater St. Louis. It is the newest line in the system.
Route description.
The Blue Line branch starts in Shrewsbury just west of River des Peres. It crosses over Interstate 44 and the continues north to the next two stations located in Maplewood; one at the Sunnen Industrial Complex, the other over at Manchester Road. The line then continues further north to the Brentwood I-64 station located in Brentwood just south of Interstate 64. It then proceeds in a tunnel just underneath Interstate 64, continuing to the Richmond Heights station in Richmond Heights. This station serves the popular St. Louis Galleria shopping center. The line then proceeds on a sharp turn east to Clayton Central station in the median of Forest Park Parkway in Clayton where it serves the Central Business District of St. Louis County. It heads further east into a tunnel opening where there is a station underneath Forsyth Boulevard and Big Bend Boulevard in University City where it serves Washington University . After crossing the St. Louis City/County boundary, the branch makes its last stop right under Skinker Boulevard in St. Louis City. The Blue Line now joins with the Red Line at Forest Park-DeBaliviere station as the Shared Alignment. The Blue Line terminates at Fairview Heights station in Fairview Heights.
Much of the southern half of the Blue Line follows a former TRRA/Rock Island railroad right of way that ran from BNSF's junction with the Cuba and River Subdivisons (known as Southeastern junction) to what is now I-170 Business Center in St. John. The current stretch of line from Forest Park to Clayton Stations was known as the Forsyth branch until Rock Island abandoned it in 1931. The Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis (TRRA) used the portion from Clayton Station onward, as well as the rest of the portion from St. John to Clayton until 1987 when the portion from Big BEnd to Olive Boulevard was severed to the lack of customers on that stretch. This was known as TRRA's Central Belt. The rest of the track was removed in 2002 just prior to construction on the Blue Line. All that remains of the original Central Belt is the portion north from Rock Island Junction near Overland, MO (where the Central Belt crossed the junction between TRRA's West Belt and the Missouri Central (now Central Midland) Railway, to just a fifth of a mile past Page Avenue where less than 10 industries still use TRRA.
Future extensions.
The Blue Line is part of the Cross County Corridor. These following extensions will include up to of track, but for in order to plan, design, and construct these separate extensions, they will need anticipated local and federal funding.

Headquarters Mobile Support Unit

The Headquarters Mobile Support Unit (HMSU) was a special unit of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
Background.
The Headquarters Mobile Support Unit (HMSU) was a uniformed elite unit established by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), intended to be the RUC equivalent of the Special Air Service (SAS). Members of the HMSU were enrolled into RUC Special Branch and were trained by the SAS to on how to confront Irish Republican Army (IRA) members and other terrorist suspects with "firepower, speed and aggression".
The unit had its prototype in the Bessbrook Support Unit (BSU) set up in 1977 as part of the scaling-up of the RUC's numbers and capabilities under Chief Constable Kenneth Newman to "Ulsterise" as far as possible the maintenance of security. The intensively trained and highly armed BSU were intended to take over from the SAS the role of deployment along the South Armagh border to intercept IRA active service units. The BSU were in 1979 replaced with a Special Patrol Group (SPG), which was in turn replaced in 1981 by the Special Support Unit (SSU). The SSU was subsequently renamed the Headquarters Mobile Support Unit (HMSU) as the initials SSU were considered too similar to SAS, suggesting a military-style unit.
"Shoot to kill".
The SSU were infamously involved in the alleged "shoot-to-kill" incidents of November and December 1982, when six suspected terrorists were shot dead in three separate incidents, all of whom turned out to be unarmed. These incidents, and evidence which came out in court of organised falsification of the details of the encounters, led to the setting up of the 1984–86 Stalker Inquiry.
In this period, according to evidence given in court at the time by RUC deputy chief constable Michael McAtamney, officers selected for the unit underwent an immensely tough two-week assessment of fitness, mental ability and endurance under pressure, followed by a four-week course including seven days devoted exclusively to weapons training; with the focus being to "eliminate the threat" posed to officers.
In addition to standard RUC weaponry, the unit additionally used Israeli-made Uzi sub-machine guns; Remington pump-action shotguns and Browning semi-automatic shotguns; the Ruger mini-light automatic rifle; and 14-shot, 54 Smith and Wesson magnums, carried as personal sidearms. According to one subsequent report, at the time of the 1982 shootings, the HMSU that had been active in the RUC southern region comprised two dozen men, working in field teams of six, travelling in pairs of specially armoured unmarked Ford Cortinas, the front passenger with a Sterling submachine gun, the rear passenger a Ruger rifle, and all three including the driver were armed with pistols.
The unit was based at RUC Lisnasharrah, East Belfast, and worked closely with the RUC plain-clothes intelligence gathering unit E4A. Many were English, and ex-soldiers. According to reports, as uncovered by the Stalker Inquiry, the units operated almost as a law unto themselves, taking orders only from a small group at Gough Barracks in Armagh that was in charge of tasking and co-ordination, who in turn answered only to Special Branch at RUC headquarters at Knock, with members not generally recognising the authority of more senior officers not in the unit, a constable on one occasion telling a CID detective to leave the site and come back after he had had a meal.
According to American writer J. Bowyer Bell there were two such units in all at the time, of 24 members each; though a 1985 newspaper article claimed at least 12 such squads were active. The same article tried to put the units in context: "The circumstances of the shootings have to be put into the context of Northern Ireland. In the same period two RUC officers who approached a car parked outside a County Down post office were shot dead by IRA men about to stage a robbery. Unionists were not slow to claim that if anyone was shooting to kill, it was the Republican paramilitaries."
Post 1982.
Following the 1982 shootings, the role of the HMSU was reined back. Subsequently the RUC would play a supporting role in such operations, but the active role in intelligence-led covert ambushes was returned to the British Army, in particular the SAS and similarly-trained army units, though under ultimate police operational control. 
Tasking of counter-terrorist operations was put into the hands of a joint committee that included army intelligence, MI5 and MI6 as well as senior police officers, rather than the original exclusive tight control by a close-knit small group of RUC officers reporting to HQ-level Special Branch. Some measures were also taken to make the Special Branch less of a force within a force, with regional RUC assistant chief constable having to be informed of Special Branch operations in their areas, and a single senior assistant chief constable position created, with oversight responsibility for both CID and Special Branch.House of Commons debates, 17 February 1988, 3:30 pm via They Work For You</ref> The HMSU continued to take part in "rapid reaction" duties, including raids on suspected terrorist properties, and spearheading riot control.
The HMSU continued in being throughout the 1980s and 1990s as an operational sub-department of Special Branch department E4. In this time the unit traced and arrested several IRA members in Northern Ireland.
Now with the level of threat posed by terrorism in Northern Ireland is not as high as in previous years the unit currently responsd to high risk police duties such as drug raids, armed response, etc. whilst monitoring the Real IRA and other dissident groups, ready to respond to any terrorist activity in Northern Ireland. HMSU is now located within the PSNI's C4 Special Operations Branch.
Divisional Mobile Support Units (DMSUs), attached to each police division, have also existed. The DMSUs have now been renamed Tactical Support Groups (TSGs).

Aspiran (grape)

Aspiran (or Aspiran noir) is a red French wine grape variety planted primarily in the Languedoc where it permitted under "Appellation d'origine contrôlée" (AOC) regulations in the red and "rosé" wines of the Minervois AOC. Aspiran is a very old variety with a long history of producing light bodied and perfumed wines. 
History.
Before the phylloxera epidemic, Aspiran was common in Languedoc, in particular in Hérault, where it once represented one quarter of the plantations in this department. The grape variety is probably named after the town Aspiran in Hérault. The severe frost in 1956 killed off much of the then existing Aspiran plantations. In 1988, only remained, and the variety is usually not being replanted.
Other grape varieties.
There are also several other grape varieties where Aspiran forms part of their name, including Aspiran blanc and Aspiran gris, but only Aspiran noir is simply called "Aspiran". Aspiran should not be confused with the Greek white grape variety Aspirant.

Tell Uqair

Tell Uqair (Tell Uquair, Tell Aqair) is a tell or settlement mound northeast of Babylon and about south of Baghdad in modern Babil Governorate, Iraq.
History of archaeological research.
The site of Tell Uqair was excavated during World War II, in 1941 and 1942, by an Iraqi Directorate General of Antiquities team led by Seton Lloyd, with Taha Baqir and Fuad Safar. The buildings and artifacts discovered were primarily from the Ubaid period, Uruk period, and the Jemdet Nasr period and included four proto-cuneiform tablets. 
Tell Uqair and its environment.
Tell Uqair is a small mound just north of Tell Ibrahim, the large mound marking the site of ancient Kutha. The topography consists of two sub-mounds separated by what is apparently the bed of an ancient canal. At maximum the hills are above the terrain line.
Occupation history.
The site of Tell Uqair first had significant occupation during the Ubaid period, and grew to its greatest extent during the Jemdet Nasr and Uruk periods. Some Early Dynastic graves and a scattering of Akkadian and Babylonian artifacts indicate the location continued in limited use up through time of Nebuchadnezzar. Because of clay tablets found at the site, it is believed to be the ancient town of Urum. The toponym for Urum is written in cuneiform as ÚR×Ú.KI, URUM4 = ÚR×ḪA, besides ÚR×A.ḪA.KI, from earlier (pre-Ur III) ÚR.A.ḪA.
The most prominent discovery at Tell Uquair was the "Painted Temple", a large complex similar in design to the "White Temple" found at Uruk. Some of the original frescos were still visible at the time of the excavation and were copied. Several frescos were recovered intact and sent to the Baghdad Museum. The temple is believed to date to the Uruk or early Jemdet Nasr period. A small adjacent Jemdet Nasr temple was of somewhat later construction and contained large amounts of pottery from that period.

Scottish New Zealander

Scottish New Zealanders are New Zealanders who are of Scottish ancestry. 
Scottish migration to New Zealand dates back to the earliest period of European colonisation, with a large proportion of Pākehā New Zealanders being of Scottish descent. However, identification as "British" or "European" New Zealanders can sometimes obscure their origin. Many Scottish New Zealanders have Māori or other non-European ancestry. 
The majority of Scottish immigrants settled in the South Island. All over New Zealand, the Scots developed different means to bridge the old homeland and the new. Many Caledonian societies were formed, well over 100 by the early twentieth century, who helped maintain Scottish culture and traditions. From the 1860s, these societies organised annual Caledonian Games throughout New Zealand. The Games were sports meets that brought together Scottish settlers and the wider New Zealand public. In so doing, the Games gave Scots a path to cultural integration as Scottish New Zealanders.
Numbers.
In 2006, the number of New Zealanders "born in Scotland" was recorded as 29,016, making it the eighth most common place of birth. In 1956, the figure was 46,401, making Scotland the second most common place of birth.
However, these figures only include people born in Scotland, not those New Zealanders who claim a Scottish identity through their parents, grandparents, or even further back. In addition, many New Zealanders come from mixed origins, with Scottish New Zealanders co-identifying as Māori or another ethnic group.
In 2006, 15,039 self-identified as Scottish.
Scottish culture in New Zealand.
The "Te Ara Encyclopedia" notes that in many cases, the distinctive features of Scottish settlers were often wiped out in a generation or two, and replaced with a British identity which consisted mostly of English culture:
Today, if there can be said to be a "stronghold" of Scottish culture in New Zealand, it would be in the regions of Southland and Otago, although many of the place names around the Waikato Region also bear links with Scotland (notably the city of Hamilton and town of Huntly).
Some of the following aspects of Scottish culture can still be found in some parts of New Zealand.
The Scottish Gaelic language and culture did not fare well. Turakina in Wanganui was originally settled by Gaelic speakers, but there is not much trace other than annual Highland games.
In the past, Scottish army regiments have been raised from New Zealand, and their successor units still exist in the New Zealand Army. According to "Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland":
The Otago and Southland Regiment is still linked to the Highlanders in the British Army.
Otago and Southland Province.
The Otago Settlement, sponsored by the Free Church of Scotland, materialised in March 1848 with the arrival of the first two immigrant ships from Greenock on the Firth of Clyde – the "John Wickliffe" and the "Philip Laing". Captain William Cargill, a veteran of the Peninsular War, served as the colony's first leader: Otago citizens subsequently elected him to the office of Superintendent.
Provincial government in New Zealand ceased in 1876, and the national limelight gradually shifted northwards. The colony divided itself into counties in 1876, two in Otago being named after the Scottish independence heroes Wallace and Bruce.
Originally part of Otago Province, Southland Province (a small part of the present Region, centred on Invercargill) was one of the provinces of New Zealand from 1861 until 1870. It rejoined Otago Province due to financial difficulties, and the provinces were abolished entirely in 1876.
In 1856, a petition was put forward to Thomas Gore Browne, the Governor of New Zealand, for a port at Bluff. Browne agreed to the petition and gave the name Invercargill to the settlement north of the port. "Inver" comes from the Scots Gaelic word "inbhir" meaning "a river's mouth" and "Cargill" is in honour of Captain William Cargill, who was at the time the Superintendent of Otago, of which Southland was then a part.
Dunedin.
The Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland founded Dunedin at the head of Otago Harbour in 1848 as the principal town of its Scottish settlement. The name comes from "Dùn Èideann", the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh, the Scottish capital. Charles Kettle the city's surveyor, instructed to emulate the characteristics of Edinburgh, produced a striking, 'Romantic' design. The result was both grand and quirky streets as the builders struggled and sometimes failed to construct his bold vision across the challenging landscape. Captain William Cargill, a veteran of the war against Napoleon, was the secular leader. The Reverend Thomas Burns, a nephew of the poet Robert Burns, was the spiritual guide.
The Octagon was first laid out during Charles Kettle's surveying of the city in 1846. His plans for the centre of Dunedin included a large Octagonal area (Moray Place) enclosing a smaller octagonal shape, originally designated as a reserve. Despite the reserve status, the Church of England sought to build in the centre of the Octagon, applying directly to Governor Sir George Grey. It was not until building was about to commence that the local (predominantly Scottish and Presbyterian) community became aware of what was happening. This resulted in a major furore within the city. Otago Superintendent William Cargill was put in charge of the dispute, resulting in the Anglicans being forced to withdraw their plans for The Octagon (The Anglican St. Paul's Cathedral stands today at the northern edge of The Octagon).
Many of the suburbs of Dunedin are named after their Edinburgh equivalents.
Otago Highlanders.
Dunedin's main rugby team are called The Highlanders. The name "Highlanders" was chosen after the early Scottish settlers in the lower South Island. These Scottish settlers were the founders of Dunedin—known as the "Edinburgh of the South", and the city where the Highlanders are based. According to the Highlanders official website: " The name and image of the Highlander conjures up visions of fierce independence, pride in one's roots, loyalty, strength, kinship, honesty, and hard work." The colours of the Highlanders encompasses the provincial colours of North Otago, Otago, and Southland; yellow, blue and maroon. Blue is also the predominant colour of the Flag of Scotland, and is used by many sports teams in that country.
University of Otago.
Dunedin founders Thomas Burns and James Macandrew urged the Otago Provincial Council during the 1860s to set aside a land endowment for an institute of higher education. An ordinance of the council established the university in 1869, giving it of land, and the power to grant degrees in Arts, Medicine, Law and Music. Burns was named Chancellor, but he did not live to see the university open on 5 July 1871. The university issued just one degree before becoming an affiliate college of the federal University of New Zealand in 1874. With the dissolving of the University of New Zealand in 1961 and passage of the University of Otago Amendment Act 1961, the university regained authority to confer degrees.
The University's coat of arms was granted by the Lord Lyon King of Arms on 21 January 1948, and features a yellow saltire, on blue.

Prime Ministers.
Many of the prime ministers of New Zealand have been of Scottish descent. They include:
"Kilted Kiwis".
"Kilted Kiwi" is a nickname given to New Zealanders who would go on to play in the Scotland national rugby union team. They have had a mixed reception, but have included some notable players. The original "kilted Kiwi" was Sean Lineen. However one of the first New Zealand born Scotland players was Andrew Alexander Bonar Lindsay, who played 2 tests in 1910-11. To qualify, they either have to have at least one Scottish parent or grandparent.
Other so-called "kilted Kiwis" apart from Sean Lineen have included:
However, this has not always been a one way trade. At least one All Black was born in Scotland – Angus Stuart.
Scottish placenames.
There are Scottish placenames all over New Zealand, but they tend to be concentrated in the southern part of South Island. Notable Scottish placenames in New Zealand include:
Many of the artificial lakes that have been formed as part of the Waitaki River hydroelectric scheme have also been given Scottish names, among them Lake Benmore and Lake Aviemore.
The South Island also contains the Strath-Taieri and the Ben Ohau Range of mountains, both combining Scots Gaelic and Maori origins. Invercargill has the appearance of a Scottish name, since it combines the Scottish prefix "Inver" ("Inbhir"), meaning a river's mouth, with "Cargill", the name of a Scottish official. (Many of Invercargill's main streets are named after Scottish rivers: Dee, Tay, Spey, Esk, Don, Doon, Clyde, etc.). Inchbonnie is a hybrid of Lowland Scots and Scottish Gaelic.

Orthodox Christianity in Uganda

Uganda is the first country to the south of the Sahara where an Orthodox Christian community began to form.
Present day.
Currently there are four Eparchies which are united into a Metropolia headed by Metropolitan Jonah Lwanga. The Metropolia is in Namungona, a suburb of the capital Kampala. The clergy consists of 55 priests and 7 deacons. It has 100 communities, many of which have no priests and are run by catechists. There are 41 brick churches, 17 medical clinics, and Holy Cross Mission Hospital. Many of the parishioners are orphaned children and total 30,000 enrolled. Many temples have parish boarding schools where children not only study, but live and eat at the expense of the parish. They also get professional education from the 13 secondary schools. There are 600 teachers, sometimes teachers from other confessions are hired, some convert to Orthodoxy in this way. At Monde there is the largest Orthodox village, "Fos Christou" (The Light of Christ). Father Antonios Mutyaba is the priest of that parish. At Monde there are 5 orphanages, a dining house, schools, a hospital, a church of Saint Anthony the Great, and the first monastery in Uganda with 2 nuns. The eldest of the nuns, Anastasia, is the first Orthodox nun in Uganda's history. In 1995 a seminary was opened within the Metropolia which is attended by 15 people. Study is 3 years long, and admission is once every two years. The most pressing problem for the church is the poverty of the African people and to keep those educated from leaving.
The Russian Orthodox Church also has a Mission Parish, The Annunciation Orthodox Church on Bukasa Island in Lake Victoria. The parish was founded in 1983, and now is under the spiritual Omophore of Metropolitan Hilarion of ROCOR. Father Christopher Walusimbi is the Parish Priest. He has taken care of orphans and operates an ambulance service and was instrumental in the establishment of a school and a medical clinic. Both the school and clinic were dedicated to St. Panteleimon, but the Ugandan government took them over and they are now secular. The clinic which was started by Father Gerasimos in 1983 was abandoned after his explusion from Uganda in 1988, however the use of aid from the Government of Japan finished the clinic. Father Christopher planned and built the stone Church which is topped by a multi-colored Russian Dome.
History.
The founders of Orthodoxy in Uganda were four men, one of them Obadia Basajjakitalo. His grandson is Jonah, present Metropolitan of Kampala and of all Uganda.
Metropolitan Jonah said: "Some of the Africans were thinking people. They read books on the history of Christianity and found out that Catholics and Protestants are in opposition to each other in the way unsuitable for true Christians. They began to study thoroughly the Bible hoping to find answers to their questions. Once, one of them, an Anglican follower Rebuen Mukasa, encountered in a dictionary the word 'Orthodoxy' and became interested in its meaning. It was called a 'true Church, Mother Church' there. He showed this to his friends and began to seek for further information on Orthodoxy".
This went on in the year 1919. They began to send letters all over the world with the questions on Orthodoxy. One came to a US citizen of African ancestry named George Alexander McGuire. He sent them some literature on his non-canonical ""African Orthodox Church"." Rebuen Mukasa and his friends then were finally convinced in setting up this religion in Africa. McGuire directed them to a Black Bishop named Daniel William Alexander who lived in South Africa. He came to Uganda and ordained them. Rebuen Mukasa became Father Spartas. But the bishop turned to be an Uniate. This was disclosed later by a Greek businessman.
The friends didn't stop their quest here. Father Spartas and his supporters found a priest from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople who traveled through Africa and baptized and chrismated (anointed) Greek children. He came to Uganda and stayed for about 18 months teaching Father Spartas, Irenaeus Magimbi, Theodoros Nankyama and his friends in Orthodox Faith. It was in the beginning of the 1930s. He advised them to place themselves under the Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria in order to be in Canonical Communion. They sent many letters to Alexandria, but there was no answer. In the meantime they baptized people and opened many parishes moving mainly by foot or by bicycles. They gained many followers, but without outside help Father Spartas, and the God loving Orthodox Christians with him, could not manage alone. Eventually they voyaged by foot, by river, by sea, by land until they arrived in the Alexandrian Patriarchate, where they spent several years being taught what Holy Orthodoxy was, ultimately being ordained and sent back to Uganda.
Canonical Orthodoxy.
But later in the year 1946 Orthodox communities of Uganda and Kenya were accepted to join the Patriarchal Throne in full canonical contact. In 1959 in Uganda was sent Bishop Nicolas, Metropolitan of Kampala and the entire East Africa. From 1959 the Patriarch of Alexandria began to assume spiritual direction for the Orthodox Churches of Africa.
By 1958 for better ruling of Orthodox communities in Eastern Africa the Irinopolis Metropolia was founded with the center in the Tanzania capital Dar es Salaam], which means "city of peace", in Greek, Irinopolis. The Bishop again ordained Father Spartas and his friends with the accordance to canons of the mother church.
Father Spartas and his friends began to create their church. First four of them converted their relatives to Orthodoxy, and spreading of the faith went further. Spartas understood that the Church is in need of educated people. He began teaching English language in the school founded by him which was officially private and belonged to the Church. The colonial authorities (Uganda received independence only in 1969), trying to secure its monopoly on education, issued a law directing to teach English only in state schools. That didn't stop Spartas and he was then sent to prison for 5 years. 
From 1958, some young Ugandans were sent to Greece and other Orthodox countries, but few of them returned to the motherland. That became one of the problems. those who returned often conflicted with elder priests.
In 1959 Father Spartas visited Greece. He made speeches to Christians and called for Greeks to come to Africa for catechization and founding of a mission. It resulted in creation of several groups, mostly youth, of prayer and material support.
One of the priests in 1965, while being in the USA, addressed to 75 Greek parishes asking for help. Missionaries in Greece and the USA started to help African Orthodox followers, and still are helping them.
The first of the missionaries was Hieromonk Chrysostom Papasarantopulos, who came to Uganda in 1960. He served in Africa till his death in December 1972. One of the most prominent missionaries was Stavrica Vachariu, an American woman of Greek ancestry who arrived in East Africa in 1971. She painted icons and taught Africans the basics of housekeeping.
The help of Greek missionaries was useful, but the principal affairs on apostolic sermon were held by native Africans themselves.
In 1972 in Alexandria for the first time in history three native Ugandans were consecrated Orthodox bishops. One of them was the enlightener of Uganda Spartas Rebuen Mukasa, named the bishop Christophor Nilopolian. He died in 1982 as the prelate of this church.
By this time they joined the Alexandria Patriarchy there were more than 10 thousand followers of Makasa and Basadjikitalo in Uganda. There is no statistics on this, and exact numbers can hardly be known. Some sources state that in the beginning of 90s there were more than 200 thousand, and in 2004 there were about 1.5 million of Orthodox Christians in Africa.
Starting from 1995, the first African became Metropolitan — the Metropolitan of Kampala and the entire Uganda Theodoros Nankyama. From 1997, he was followed by Jonah, grandson of Obadia Basadjikitalo.

Miriam Christine

Miriam Christine Borg is a Maltese pop and rhythm and blues singer best known for representing Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest 1996.
Early life.
Born in Santo Antônio do Descoberto, Goiás, Brazil but raised on the Mediterranean island of Gozo, Miriam Christine was destined to hit the big time. At the age of 6, she was introduced to singing and piano lessons. She took to listening to soul music but was also disposed to listening to various other styles- from Beethoven, Mozart, and such jazz greats as Marian McPartland, Oscar Peterson, Fats Waller and of course jazz singers like Billie Holiday and Nina Simone. Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Diana Ross were also big inspirations as were latter day talents like Mary J. Blige, Toni Braxton, and Alicia Keys. She took all of those different genres of music and rolled them all into one, to create a style all her own.
The road to success wasn't an easy one. Raised in the small island of Gozo, she had an idyllic upbringing but then this was in total contrast to the rhythm and blues ambiance of New York or Detroit or even San Francisco. On the other hand, it helped Miriam Christine to project a different approach to rhythm and blues. She took to singing and took part in various festivals before eventually winning the "Song for Europe Festival" and representing Malta in the 1996 Eurovision Song Contest with the song "In A Woman’s Heart".
The Eurovision Success.
In 1996 the Eurovision Song Contest was held in Oslo. Malta had high hopes on Miriam Christine. In fact, more than 100 Maltese fans were in the Spectrum Theater for the big night. The video clip of the song "In a Woman's Heart", written by Paul Abela and Alfred Sant, was fresh and modern. On the night of the contest the young singer was also modern and fresh, wearing a Benetton outfit and accompanied on stage by 3 backing vocalists-one of whom was Georgina Abela, the wife of the composer and actually a former contestant herself.
In the beginning of the voting Malta was among the top 5 with great chances of victory. However, the Maltese entry did not get so many points as the night went by, eventually ranking 10th place with 68 points.
Recent Projects.
In 1998 her debut album was in the stores. It was entitled "Smile and Shine" and it was full of rhythm and blues and African American influences. She also furthered her studies in music and found a job with "Education 22", the state education channel. She continued to produce albums and she is considered to be Malta's one and only r'n'b singer. She is also the composer of most of her songs.
In 2008 she made one of her biggest dreams come true, by forming "The Gozo Children’s Choir". She also gave big concerts during the Malta Gay Pride and she was the winner of the popular television contest "Malta Hit Song Contest", which is aired on OneTv. Her entry was entitled "Alone Today" and nowadays the singer along with her team is working on a video clip which will accompany the official release of the single to the local market.

Jimmi Clay

Dr. Jimmi Clay is a fictional character in the BBC soap opera "Doctors", played by Adrian Lewis Morgan. He made his first appearance on 5 September 2005. He is currently the longest serving character since the departure of Julia Parsons.
Storylines.
Background.
Jimmi's mother was killed in a car accident when he was eight. He was raised by his father and elder sister. His father ruled with an iron fist and locked Jimmi in the cupboard under the stairs whenever he misbehaved. As a result, Jimmi suffers from claustrophobia and OCD.
2005—.
Jimmi had a romance with receptionist Sarah Finch and they became engaged, but it didn't last long as she left The Mill to emigrate. In 2007-2008, Jimmi was romantically involved with DI Eva Moore. But this romance ended in October 2008, because Eva had to go into witness protection and leave Letherbridge. In April 2009, he helped colleague Karen Hollins try to lose weight at her request. However she was seen sneaking in chocolate and crisps and, not surprisingly, Jimmi started to get fed up with her. Daniel Granger and Lily Hassan also accused Jimmi of creating a smell in reception, but this was discovered to be caused by the cabbage soup Jimmi had encouraged Karen to try as part of her diet. Jimmi had his own show on Radio Letherbridge and won "The Golden Microphone" Award for the show. On December 17, 2009, Jimmi carried out a house call in the countryside. It was dark and there was no answer at the house; walking back to his car assuming no one was home, he was nearly hit by another car which suddenly sped up the drive. The next day the Mill had its Christmas party and Julia wondered why he was not present. Simon said he had probably gone on holiday early, but at the end of the episode Jimmi was seen drugged and unconscious, tied to a radiator.
In January 2010, it became clear to the viewer that Jimmi had been kidnapped by Sissy and Ivor Juggins. Julia was worried about Jimmi and asked Rob (Karen's husband) to look for him as it was unlike him to leave so suddenly. Sissy, a big fan of Dr. Jimmi, had told him that she wanted a baby with him. Jimmi obviously did not feel the same way and attempted to resist her at every opportunity, despite being heavily drugged for much of the time. Ivor agreed to keep Jimmi hostage, because he also had romantic feelings for him - Sissy was unaware of this. She was also unaware that Ivor disliked having to look after her and sharing their home, resulting in many sibling arguments which Jimmi quickly learnt to exploit with his multiple (failed) escape attempts. Jimmi finally managed to escape by himself on January 21, 2010, after Ivor and Sissy had a visit from Rob, who was looking into Jimmi's disappearance. Ivor decided they had to get rid of the doctor by putting him in the shed. Sissy gave Jimmi the keys to his feet chains, as he convinced her they would run away together, but Jimmi escaped after beating Ivor off with a house brick. Sissy dropped the knife she had picked up and let him get away. When Jimmi was recovering in hospital, Julia was shocked at the effect the kidnapping had had on him; but he was quick to make clear to reporters that Sissy and Ivor had mental health problems and needed treatment not punishment. When Jimmi visited a young patient, he suffered a panic attack when the patient and her mother appeared to be his fans. However his symptoms worsened when their actions became similar to those of Sissy and Ivor. He nearly deserted them when he felt that he couldn't cope, but decided to change his mind when the patient's mother reassured him that they wouldn't harm him.

Alexander Gordon (antiquary)

Alexander Gordon (1692?-1755) was a Scottish antiquary and singer. His survey of Roman sites, the "Itinerarium", was considered an essential reference by all Roman antiquaries of his time.
Early life and education.
Gordon was born at Aberdeen, Scotland, not later than 1692. After earning an M.A. at the university of Aberdeen, where he distinguished himself by his classical attainments, he resided for a time in the city, eking out a living as a teacher of languages and music. He also painted portraits in oil. He afterwards visited the continent, at first probably as a tutor, and returned home an excellent French and Italian scholar, and with a good knowledge of art and antiquities. He told Stukeley that when at Capua with Sir George Byng (afterwards Viscount Torrington) "they sav'd the fine amphitheatre there, the 3rd in the world, which the Germans were going to pull down to repair the fortifications, by speaking to the governor & viceroy at Naples." He studied music in Italy, and when in London he occasionally sang in opera, and among his countrymen was known as "Singing Sandie." At one time he appears to have been an itinerant teacher of music, more especially while collecting the materials for his "Itinerarium", some time before 1720.
Survey of Roman ruins.
In 1720 Stukeley, in his "Account of a Roman Temple Oon and other antiquities near Graham's Dike in Scotland", expressed his wonder that no Scotsman had hitherto investigated the Roman antiquities of the country. "This," says Gordon, "was sufficient excitement for me to proceed still more vigorously in collecting what I had begun." During three successive years he visited different parts of Scotland and Northumberland, exploring, drawing, and measuring ancient remains, at much cost and
some hardship. Liberal patrons, however, were not wanting, such as the Duke of Queensberry, to whom the work was subsequently dedicated, the Earl of Pembroke, the Earl of Findlater, the Earl of Hertford, and Viscount Bateman, whose cabinet of curiosities he was often enabled to enrich during his travels at home and abroad, Edward Chandler, then bishop of Lichfield, and Duncan Forbes of Culloden, at that time lord advocate. His great patron was Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, Edinburghshire. He was a frequent guest at Old Penicuik House, where he had access to a splendid museum of antiquities, and was accompanied by Clerk in his Northumbrian explorations, as well as in others nearer home. The work, which had been largely subscribed for, appeared as "Itinerarium Septentrionale; or, a Journey thro' most of the Counties of Scotland, and those in the North of England. . . . Part 1. Containing an Account of all the Monuments of Roman Antiquity. . . . Part 2. An Account of the Danish Invasions on Scotland . . . With sixty-six copperplates" an appendix. In this laborious work Gordon proved himself an honest, painstaking antiquary. Though his theories have long since been exploded, he has preserved records of earthworks, inscriptions, and relics of various kinds, of which but for him all knowledge would have been lost. The appendix derived its chief
value from a learned correspondence concerning ancient sepulchral rites in Britain between Sir John Clerk and Roger Gale which Gordon here made public, greatly to their annoyance. He apologises for the inelegant illustrations of his "Itinerarium". On page 188 of the "Itinerarium" Gordon announced his intention of issuing in a few days proposals for engraving by subscription "A Compleat View of the Roman Walls in Britain". It is much to be regretted that for want of the necessary funds this survey, with drawings of all the inscriptions and altars discovered, should not have appeared.
Later life in Scotland and England.
Gordon now attempted to give practical effect to a project for cutting a navigable canal between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The scheme, however, was not new to the government, who considered that the profits would not answer the charge. Gordon's circumstances, always narrow, were not improved by the prosecution of projects which never repaid him. According to John Whiston, the London bookseller, he was for some time in partnership with John Wilcox, a bookseller in the Strand, "but his education, temper, and manners did not suit him for a trade. . . .Poverty tempted him to dishonesty," or perhaps want of business habits may have rendered him careless in regard to money transactions. His next publication was "The Lives of Pope Alexander VI and his son Cæsar Borgia; comprehending the Wars in the Reigns of Charles VIII and Lewis XII, Kings of France, and the chief Transactions and Revolutions in Italy from . . . 1492 to ... 1506. With an Appendix of original Pieces referred to in the book". The volume contains portraits of Alexander VI and of Cæsar Borgia, the former probably etched by the author. In 1751 a French version appeared at Amsterdam. A solitary dramatic attempt, "Lupone, or the Inquisitor: a comedy," was deemed by the managers to be too classical for representation. He was more successful with a translation of the "De Amphitheatro" of Francesco Scipione, marchese di Maffei, published as "A Compleat History of the Ancient Amphitheatres, more peculiarly regarding the Architecture of these Buildings, and in particular that of Verona. . . . Adorned with Sculptures plates; also, some Account of this learned Work". In 1731-1732 Gordon had made some additions to his "Itinerarium Septentrionale", of which a Latin edition was being prepared in Holland. This never appeared, but Gordon printed the supplement he had prepared for it in a separate form, entitled "Additions and Corrections by way of Supplement to the Itinerarium Septentrionale, containing several dissertations on, and descriptions of, Roman Antiquities discovered in Scotland since the publishing the said Itinerary. Together with Observations on other Ancient Monuments found in the North of England. Never before publish'd". In 1736 Gordon was appointed secretary to the Society for the Encouragement of Learning, with an annual salary of £50. In the same year he succeeded Stukeley as secretary to the Society of Antiquaries, of which he had been elected a fellow on 17 February 1725. It was probably through Stukeley's influence that he also obtained the secretaryship of the Egyptian Society, of which Stukeley was one of the founders, and thus had a new bent given to his researches. Gordon published two very learned treatises wherein he undertook to solve the mysteries of hieroglyphics and to illustrate "all the Egyptian mummies in England." Their titles are "An Essay towards explaining the Hieroglyphical Figures on the Coffin of the Ancient Mummy belonging to Capt. William Lethieullier. (An Essay towards explaining the antient Hieroglyphical Figures on the Egyptian Mummy in the Museum of Doctor Mead)". The letterpress is explanatory of three only of the twenty-five plates, and the remainder never appeared. The manuscript, along with the drawings, was apparently in the sale of Sir Charles Frederick's library in July 1786. In the second essay the author mentions another work, as "nearly ready," "An Essay towards illustrating the History, Chronology, and Mythology of the Ancient Egyptians, from the earliest ages on record, till the Dissolution of their Empire, near the Times of Alexander". It was not, however, completed until 6 July 1741. By that time Gordon had resigned his secretaryships. He was married, and no doubt found his income insufficient. Whiston says that Gordon having been found deficient in his accounts was dismissed from the Society for the Encouragement of Learning, and his effects seized on.
Life in South Carolina.
Gordon sailed for South Carolina in August 1741, as secretary to James Glen, F.S.A., the newly appointed governor of that province. There he eventually prospered. From the recorded copy of a deed still extant at Charleston it appears that one Hamerton, the registrar of the province, farmed out his office to Gordon, and by this deed appointed him his attorney to transact all the business and receive all the fees of the office. There is also among the recorded conveyances one of a large lot of land in Charleston to him, dated 28 March 1746; and in his will he devised to his son and daughter a lot of land in Ansonborough, South Carolina, and all the houses erected thereon. He still kept up a desultory correspondence with Sir John Clerk, to whom he confessed himself "vastly weary" of colonial life. To the Royal Society he sent an elaborate description of the natural history of South Carolina, which was not read until 25 May 1758. Nor was it printed in the "Philosophical Transactions". On 22 August 1754 Gordon, "being sick and weak of body," made his will at Charleston. To his son, Alexander, an attorney of Charleston, he bequeathed his own portrait, painted by himself, together with other of his paintings. He also strictly enjoined him to publish his manuscript "Essay towards illustrating the History of ... the Ancient Egyptians". The essay was never printed, and is preserved in the British Museum, having been purchased in March 1831. Gordon's wife is not mentioned in his will. He died before 23 July 1755, when the devisees under his will executed a conveyance of land in South Carolina. His daughter, Frances Charlotte Gordon, appears to have been married, on 30 May 1763 to John Troup, a Charleston attorney. None of his descendants are now known to survive in South Carolina. The traditions of the Penicuick family represent Gordon as a grave man, of formal habits, tall, lean, and usually taciturn. Beaupré Bell made a bust of him after an original given by Gordon to Sir Andrew Fountaine's niece.
The "Itinerarium", the essential handbook of all Roman antiquaries of that day, was a favourite with Sir Walter Scott, who has immortalised it in "The Antiquary" as that prized folio which Jonathan Oldbuck undid from its brown paper wrapper in the Hawes fly or Queensferry diligence.

VanFleet Hotel

The VanFleet Hotel in Farmington, Utah was built during the 1860s for Thomas and Electra Hunt. Originally a residence, it became a hotel in the 1870s as a result of its proximity to a Wells Fargo stage coach stop. It was purchased by Hyrum Van Fleet in 1908, but suffered a devastating fire in 1913. The subsequent reconstruction doubled its size. As it was next to the courthouse, it became known as the "honeymoon hotel" as a result of the many newlyweds who stayed there. The Van Fleet family operated the hotel until 1953, when it was converted to apartments. It currently houses dental offices after a 1995 renovation. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 19, 1991.

The Master of the Iron Hand is a fictional martial artist and sensei in comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Staz Johnson and Chuck Dixon and first appeared in "Robin" #49 (1998).
Fictional character biography.
In "Robin" #49, Robin (Tim Drake) journeys to France seeking martial arts instruction whereupon he joins the dojo of the Master of the Iron Hand. The Iron Master teaches both Robin and a young female student named Dava, who had come to him because she wished to learn his most feared technique, "The Whispering Hand". Dava, small but fast, had realized years earlier that she would need to end fights quickly if she was to be effective and had become a master of "single blow techniques", attacks that could end a fight with a single move. Dava's mastery of these techniques had drawn the attention of Lady Shiva (earlier Dava had used her skills to kill the crew of a ship carrying weapons intended to kill the people of her homeland). Shiva, in her guise as the "Tengu", arrives at the Iron Master's dojo seeking Dava. Dava, however, had left upon learning the Whispering Hand technique, and the Iron Master refuses to give away his student's identity or location. Robin, realizing that there was nothing he could do against Shiva, agrees to the Iron Master's request that he face Shiva alone. The Iron Master reveals that the Armless Master, who had been killed by Shiva, is his brother. Shiva recognizes this, stating that the brothers had been legends in the Thai fighting circuits. It is revealed that the Iron Master has no legs and had once been known as the Legless Master, just as his brother had been known as the Armless Master. The Iron Master does battle with Shiva, but is defeated and killed, never revealing Dava's identity or location.

Sherman Harrill

Sherman Jordan "Tank" "Sherminator" "Harru" Harrill (May 11, 1941–November 4, 2002) was an American Isshinryu Karate teacher.
Early years.
Born in Lebanon, Missouri Harrill was one of four children of Ernie Eldorse and Etna Estle (Churchill) Harrill. While he was still young, his family relocated to Carson, Iowa where he finished High School. After graduating High School, at the age of 17, Harrill enlisted in The United States Marines Corps on July 21, 1958. After finishing boot camp and supplemental training Harrill was assigned to the Third Marine Division and stationed at Camp Courtney on Okinawa, Japan beginning on March 6, 1959. There he was bunkmates with Charlie Connors, Gary Baker and John De Santis, who introduced him to Isshinryu Karate founder Tatsuo Shimabuku.
Isshinryu Karate.
Harrill began studying in 1959 under Tatsuo Shimabuku at his karate dojo in Agena, Okinawa, where he studied for approximately 14 months. He was awarded his first degree black belt (shodan) in 1960. Prior to leaving Okinawa, in mid-May 1960, Tatsuo Shimabuku called a meeting with Harrill and John De Santis. At that meeting he asked them if they planned to teach karate upon returning to the United States. When Harrill and DeSantis said yes, they received the rank of sixth degree black belt (rokudan) to be assumed at a later date after they had years of training and fulfilled the requirements.
Harrill was one of the founding members of the Okinawan Karate Union, an organization that was dedicated to the promulagation and preservation of Isshinryu Karate in the United States and abroad. He was recognized by "Who's Who in Isshinryu Karate" and was inducted into the Isshinryu Karate Hall of Fame in 2001.
Return to the United States.
Harrill returned to the United States and took a job as a mechanic at Sayer's Volkswagen in Council Bluffs, Iowa and later moved to Storm Lake, Iowa where he took a job at Import Motors. On September 11, 1964, he married Linda Marie Nelson at the Storm Lake United Methodist Church. Together, the couple had two daughters Leslie Marie and Courtney Ann. The family relocated to Carson, Iowa where Harrill worked at Tim O'Neill Auto center as a salesmen and eventually as their service manager.
While residing in Carson, Harrill began teaching Isshinryu Karate to his two daughters, Greg Eggers, and Eggers' daughter Angela.
In 1983, Harrill's daughters were killed, along with Angela Eggers, when the vehicle they were riding in was struck by a drunk driver. Harrill then took a job as a school bus driver with the Macedonia School District and later opened Harrill's School of Isshinryu Karate. During this period Harrill also began traveling throughout the United States teaching Isshinryu Karate, he also traveled to South Africa to teach karate. Harrill's seminars focused on basics (kihion), forms (kata) and self defense fighting (kumite) techniques.
In 2002, Harrill was diagnosed with esophogeal and stomach cancer. He died on November 4, 2002, as a result of complications of cancer surgery. He was buried with full military honors provided by a Color Guard provided by The United States Marine Corps Engineer Co.

It reaffirmed the importance of continuing the mediation efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group in the light of the Madrid document dated 29 November 2007, and subsequent discussions.
The parties reached an agreement that "reach a peaceful settlement that must be accompanied by a legally binding international guarantees all its aspects and stages".
According to the Russian co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group, Yuri Merzlyakov, the main value of the declaration is that it was the first since 1994, agreed to in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict, and concluded "directly between the two conflicting parties".

Hoop Jr.

Hoop Jr. (foaled in Kentucky in 1942), was an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning Kentucky Derby in 1945.
Background.
Hoop Jr. was a bay horse sired by the French-bred stallion Sir Gallahad, a full brother to Bull Dog, who sired Bull Lea). He was out of the American stakes winning mare One Hour, a daughter of the French bred Snob, who had been purchased for the third highest amount ever paid for a horse imported into the United States for racing purposes.
Hoop Jr. was the first Thoroughbred horse Fred W. Hooper, an Alabama and Florida building contractor, ever bought. He named him after his youngest son, Fred Jr. He paid $10,000 for the colt at the Keeneland Sales. Hooper was quoted many years later saying, "I liked the way he looked, the way he walked, everything, and I said, I'm going to own you."
Racing career.
At the age of two, Hoop Jr. started in five modest stakes events; he won twice, placed three times (the Bowie Kindergarten Stakes, the Pimlico Nursery Stakes, and the Aberdeen Stakes), and then developed osselets, a condition that afflicts mostly young horses. Hooper had his "ankles fired" (heat applied), then turned him out at his Alabama Farm to save him for the following year's Kentucky Derby. Most considered this ambition overly optimistic. But Hooper, who raced Susan's Girl, Precisionist, and Copelan, said, "He was the best racehorse I ever owned. He could run as far as races are laid out and as fast as anybody."
Trained by Ivan Parke, in his three-year-old debut, Hoop Jr. came in fourth, the only time in his career when more than one rival finished before him. He was beaten by the great filly Gallorette as well. In 1945, the Wood Memorial was run in two divisions. In the first, Gallorette came in second to Jeep. In the second division, Hoop Jr. won, running faster than both Gallorette and Jeep in their division.
In the 1945 Kentucky Derby, Eddie Arcaro rode Hoop Jr. over a muddy track against a field of 15. He took the lead going past the grandstand the first time and kept increasing it until he easily won by six lengths against Pot o' Luck and Darby Dieppe. Fred Hooper had won the Kentucky Derby with his first race horse. He said, "I never thought I'd make it this quick.".
Two weeks later, Hoop, Jr. ran in the Preakness Stakes. Running in a comfortable third place (although for a time he was pinched in along the rail), he then made his move only to suddenly give way. The race was won by Polynesian, although Hoop Jr. managed to come in second with a bowed tendon.
Stud record.
His racing career over, he entered stud in 1946. He died and was buried at Hooper Farm in Ocala, Florida in 1964. Fred Hooper lived until he was 102 years old.

The Connecticut River Museum is a U.S. educational and cultural institution based at Steamboat Dock in Essex, Connecticut that focuses on the marine environment and maritime heritage of the Connecticut River Valley.
The three-story Connecticut River Museum is located in a restored 1878 steamboat warehouse. The museum opened to the public in 1975, with Connecticut Governor Ella Grasso as its first paid member and "ex officio" patron. The core of its collection came from the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, which provided the museum with a loan of nautical artwork, navigation equipment and maritime-related artifacts.
The museum's main and third levels offer changing exhibits, while its second level is home to a permanent exhibition on shipbuilding, which includes historical maps and models of steamboats and exhibits on the piscine species in the Connecticut River.
The museum's collection also includes a full-scale replica of "Turtle", the first American submarine, which was constructed in Essex in 1776 for use against the British in the American Revolution. The museum property also includes a boathouse and a research library. In December 1995, the museum was given a triangular waterfront property, valued at US$910,000, in the neighboring village of Old Saybrook, Connecticut, by Bill and Victoria Winterer, who were among the museums co-founders. The property is used as a waterfront park managed by the museum.
In 2011 the museum caught fire. They had to rebuild part of it.

Scouts (Baden-Powell Scouts' Association)

As with Scouts in The Scout Association, the Scout section of the BPSA is the direct descendant of the original Scout Patrols which formed in the United Kingdom in 1908. The section is open to both boys and girls between the ages of 10–15 years, and are now formed into local Scout Troops.
Scout Troops form part of a Scout Group. The Scout section follows on from the Wolf Cub Pack (8-10 year olds) and Scouts move onto the Senior Scout section at the age of 15.
A general Scouting programme is adopted by Scout Troops, but it is possible for specialist troops to be formed. Sea Scouts and Air Scouts are example of specialist programme troops.
Organisation.
The Scout Troop forms the core section of most Scout Groups. The Troop is the longest running section within the organisation, although it was originally termed the Scout Patrol when the movement started in 1907.
Most Groups will have one Troop, while some others may, rarely, be able to support two more, depending on the numbers of Scouts and adult leaders within the Group.
Scout Troops have an adult leadership team consisting of a warranted Scout Master and one or two Assistant Scout Masters. They can also be supported by adult helpers and Senior or Rover Scout Instructors.
The Scouts within the Troop are divided into Patrols, ideally of 6-8 members, with a Patrol Leader and an Assistant Patrol Leader. The Patrol Leader is appointed by the adult leaders, with the Assistant Patrol Leader being chosen by the Patrol Leader. Some Troops may also hold a position for a Senior Patrol Leader.
Within the Troop, the Patrol Leaders hold a regular council and are able to plan and run activities and deal with matters of discipline under the guidance of the Scout Master.
Training Scheme.
The B-P Scouts follow a development of the original Training Scheme laid down by Baden-Powell:
Proficiency Awards.
The Scouts are also able to complete a range of proficiency awards. All Scouting activities are properly supervised by qualified instructors for that activity.

Pont sur la Laye

The Pont sur la Laye or Pont roman de Mane () is an old stone arch bridge across the stream Laye in the French Provence close to the town Mane.
__NOTOC__
Construction.
The 40 m long and 3.2 m wide bridge features three segmental arches with a span to rise ratio of up to c. 3:1. Its spans are 2.80 m, 7.90 m and 11.40; the thickness of the two larger arch ribs is between one and two Roman feet, making the structure one of the few Roman bridges whose ratio for rib thickness to span is lower than the commonly applied ancient standard of 1:20. 
The bridge was built of local limestone whose shape varies according to its function: the arches consist of voussoirs, the spandrel walls of irregular stonework. The main pier is protected both upstream and downstream by large triangular cutwaters out of rectangular blocks of stone. The paved roadway rises sharply from the left bank to the main arch, and then drops in a gentler gradient to the higher bank on the other side. The parapet, which has been reported as partly removed by O’Connor in 1993, has been apparently repaired in the meantime.
Dating.
According to the Italian bridge builder Gazzola, the Pont sur la Laye dates from the end of the 1st or beginning of the 2nd century AD, thus belonging to a round dozen known Roman segmental arch bridges. Structurae, though, ascribes an early Romanesque origin to the structure (11th century). Following the Mane homepage, the two side arches, along with their breakwaters, were added as late as the 17th century, which means that the segmental arches are of a relatively late date.

Matrix differential equation

A differential equation is a mathematical equation for an unknown function of one or several variables that relates the values of the function itself and of its derivatives of various orders. A matrix differential equation contains more than one function stacked into vector form with a matrix relating the functions to their derivatives.
For example, a simple matrix ordinary differential equation is
where formula_2 is an "n"×1 vector of functions of an underlying variable , formula_3 is the vector of first derivatives of these functions, and formula_4 is an "n"×"n" matrix, of which all elements are constants. 
Note that by using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and Vandermonde-type matrices, a solution may be given in a simple form. Below the solution is displayed in terms of Putzer's algorithm.
This differential equation has the following general solution:
where formula_6, formula_7, ... and formula_8 are the eigenvalues of formula_4; formula_10, formula_11, ... and formula_12 are the respective eigenvectors of formula_4 and formula_14, formula_15, ... and formula_16 are constants.
Stability and steady state of the matrix system.
The matrix equation formula_17 with "n"×1 parameter vector b is stable if and only if all eigenvalues of the matrix A have a negative real part. The steady state x* to which it converges if stable is found by setting formula_18, yielding formula_19, assuming A is invertible. Thus the original equation can be written in homogeneous form in terms of deviations from the steady state: formula_20.
A different way of expressing this (closer to regular usage) is that x* is a particular solution to the in-homogeneous equation, and all solutions are in the form formula_21, with formula_22 a solution to the homogeneous equation (b=0).
Solution in matrix form.
Matrix exponentials can be used to express the solution of formula_20 
Putzer Algorithm for computing.
Given a matrix formula_4 with eigenvalues formula_26 then
Where
The equations for formula_34 are simple first order nonhomogeneous ODEs.
Notice the algorithm does not require that the matrix formula_4 is diagonalizable and avoids the complexity of using Jordan canonical form when it is not needed.
Deconstructed example of a matrix ordinary differential equation.
A first-order homogeneous matrix ordinary differential equation in two functions "x(t)" and "y(t)", when taken out of matrix form, has the following form:
where "formula_37" and "formula_38" may be any arbitrary scalars.
Higher order matrix ODE's may possess a much more complicated form.
Solving deconstructed matrix ordinary differential equations.
The process of solving the above equations and finding the required functions, of this particular order and form, consists of 3 main steps. Brief descriptions of each of these steps are listed below:
The final, third, step in solving these sorts of ordinary differential equations is usually done by means of plugging in the values, calculated in the two previous steps into a specialized general form equation, mentioned later in this article.
Solved example of a matrix ODE.
To solve the matrix ODE's according to the three steps above, using simple matrices in the process, let us find, say, function formula_39 and function formula_40, both in terms of the single underlying variable "t", in the following linear differential equation of the first order:
To solve this particular ordinary differential equation, at some point of the solving process, we need an initial value, a starting point. In this case, we use "formula_42"
First step.
The first step, that has already been mentioned above, is finding the eigenvalues. The process of finding the eigenvalues is not a very difficult process. Both eigenvalues and eigenvectors are useful in numerous branches of mathematics, including higher engineering mathematics/calculations(i.e. Applied Mathematics), mechanics, physical mathematics, mathematical economics, and linear algebra. 
Therefore, the process consists of the following:
The derivative notation "x' " etc. seen in one of the vectors above is known as Lagrange's notation, first introduced by Joseph Louis Lagrange. It is equivalent to the derivative notation "dx/dt" used in the previous equation, known as Leibniz's notation, honouring the name of Gottfried Leibniz.
Once the coefficients of the two variables have been written in the matrix form shown above, we may start the process of evaluating the eigenvalues. To do that we are going to have to find the determinant of the matrix that is formed when an identity matrix, formula_45, multiplied by some constant lambda, symbol λ, is subtracted from our coefficient matrix in the following way:
Applying further simplification and basic rules of matrix addition we come up with the following:
Applying the rules of finding the determinant of a single 2×2 matrix, we obtain the following elementary quadratic equation:
which may be reduced further to get a simpler version of the above:
Now finding the two roots, formula_51 and formula_52 of the given quadratic equation by applying the factorization method we get the following:
The values, formula_57 and formula_58, that we have calculated above are the required eigenvalues. Once we find these two values, we proceed to the second step of the solution. We'll use the calculated eigenvalues later in the final solution.
In some cases, say other matrix ODE's, the eigenvalues may be complex, in which case the following step of the solving process, as well as the final form and the solution, dramatically change.
Second step.
As it was already mentioned above, in a simple description, this step involves finding the eigenvectors by means of using the information originally given to us.
For each of the eigenvalues calculated we are going to have an individual eigenvector. For our first eigenvalue, which is formula_59, we have the following:
Simplifying the above expression by applying basic matrix multiplication rules we have:
All of these calculations have been done only to obtain the last expression, which in our case is formula_63. Now taking some arbitrary value, presumably a small insignificant value, which is much easier to work with, for either formula_64 or formula_65 (in most cases it does not really matter), we substitute it into formula_63. Doing so produces a very simple vector, which is the required eigenvector for this particular eigenvalue. In our case, we pick formula_67, which, in turn determines that formula_68 and, using the standard vector notation, our vector looks like this:
Performing the same operation using the second eigenvalue we calculated, which is formula_70, we obtain our second eigenvector. The process of working out this vector is not shown, but the final result is as follows:
Once we've found both needed vectors, we start the third and last step. Don't forget that we'll substitute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors determined above into a specialized equation (shown shortly).
Third (final) step.
This final step actually finds the required functions that are 'hidden' behind the derivatives given to us originally. There are two functions because our differential equations deal with two variables.
The equation, which involves all the pieces of information that we have previously found has the following form:
Substituting the values of eigenvalues and eigenvectors we get the following expression:
Applying further simplification rules we have:
Simplifying further and writing the equations for functions formula_75 and formula_76 separately:
The above equations are in fact the functions that we needed to find, but they are in their general form and if we want to actually find their exact forms and solutions, now is the time to look back at the information given to us, the so-called initial value problem. At some point during solving these equations we have come across formula_79, which plays the role of starting point for our ordinary differential equation. Now is the time to apply this condition, which lets us find the constants, A and B. As we see from the formula_79 condition, when formula_81, the overall equation is equal to 1. Thus we may construct the following system of linear equations:
Solving these equations we find that both constants A and B are equal to 1/3. Therefore if we substitute these values into the general form of these two functions we have their exact forms:
which is our final form of the two functions we were required to find.

Drive-thru voting

Drive-Thru Voting describes the method of voting in an election whereby completed ballot papers submitted by placing them in a drop-box. Drive-thru voting is an alternative to having voters go in person to a polling station, vote electronically via an electronic voting system, and postal voting. Despite the title "Drive-Thru Voting", the act can be accomplished on foot, but is most commonly practiced from a vehicle. 
The drive-thru method is supported for its convenience compared to traditional voting methods. It can also be used to offer expanded hours for voting as a box can be made available 24 hours a day. This method of voting is available to voters on a limited basis including in El Dorado County, California, for the 2008 election year where more than 500 voters have utilized the drop boxes.
Drawbacks.
Concerns about voting in a box and postal voting have been raised. The system has less protection to ensure a secret ballot, in that people cast their vote outside the security of a polling station. In addition the boxes could be tampered with or vandalized, if left unmonitored.
Drive-Thru voting can be a way to prevent manipulation of an election through get out the vote efforts, for instance, in state conventions of a society, in which supporters of a cause or candidate bus in their supporters to vote and then bus them back.

Soul City Records is an American record label founded by singer Johnny Rivers in 1966. The most notable acts on Soul City were The 5th Dimension, Al Wilson, and Rivers himself. The label was distributed by Liberty Records. With the help of David Geffen, Rivers sold the label (but not rights to the name) to Bell Records in 1970. Rivers' 1976 hit "Swayin to the Music (Slow Dancin')" on Big Tree Records bore the Soul City logo. Rivers reactivated the label in 1988 to issue his own recordings, hence making Soul City a private label. To date, the Soul City label has Rivers as its only recording artist.

<doc id="20071574" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20071574" title="Andricus lignicola">
Andricus lignicola

Cola-nut galls develop as a chemically induced distortion of leaf axillary or terminal buds on Pedunculate Oak ("Quercus robur") or Sessile Oak ("Quercus petraea") trees, caused by the agamic gall wasp Andricus lignicola (Hartig, 1840) which lays single eggs within leaf buds using their ovipositor. A previous name or synonym for the species "A. lignicola" is "A. lignicolus" and "A. venheurni".
The physical appearance of the galls.
The galls are found in small groups, which however do not coalesce, helping to prevent mis-identification with the Oak marble gall (Andricus kollari), in addition the shape is ovoid rather than spherical and it is scaly rather than smooth. It grows up to about 10 x 8 mm and is at first green, rapidly changing to grey-brown, with light red patches where the original bud scales have separated. It is hard and firm, but does not always persist on the tree for very long. Once the imago has emerged a small circular hole is apparent.
Distribution.
It is well known in continental Europe, occurring from Holland to Asia Minor. 
Life-cycle.
The imago of the agamic phase emerges in early summer following the gall's inception. The bisexual generation gall is very similar to that of "A. kollari," effecting the live bud of "Quercus" species and has only been seen under culture conditions (1975).
Gall-forming insects.
Some herbivorous insects therefore create their own micro-habitats by forming usually highly distinctive plant structures called galls, made up of plant tissue but controlled by the insect. Galls act as both the habitat, and food sources for the maker of the gall. The artichoke gall is formed from entirely from the bud, composed of nutritious starch and other tissues. Some galls act as "physiologic sinks", concentrating resources in the gall from the surrounding plant parts. Galls may also provide the insect with physical protection from predators.
Predators, inquilines and parasitoids.
Since its arrival in Britain "Andricus quercuscalicis" has acquired a guild of inquilines and parasitoids. 
Infestations of cola-nut galls.
Removing and destroying cola-nut galls before they dry and the wasps emerge may help to reduce the infestation. While fairly large, and sometimes present in quite large numbers on scrub specimens, they cause no measurable harm.

<doc id="20071586" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20071586" title="Pittsburgh Athletic Club">
Pittsburgh Athletic Club

The Pittsburgh Athletic Club or Pittsburgh PAC was one the earliest professional ice hockey teams. It was based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from around 1895 until 1904 and again from 1907 to 1909. The team was a member of the Pittsburgh Hockey League, which was formed in 1896 and became known as the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League by 1900.
History.
Origins.
In 1895, Pittsburgh officials, constructed the Schenley Park Casino which featured the first artificial ice-making plant in North America. The 1895-96 winter season also saw the first introduction of hockey in the city. On December 30, 1895, the "Pittsburgh Press" made mention of a “great international hockey and polo tournament” opening game at the Casino. The newspaper reported that a team consisting of ten players from Queen's University played against a group of local players from Western University (today the University of Pittsburgh) and Pittsburgh Catholic College of the Holy Ghost (today Duquesne University) and a half hour of exhibition of hockey was played before the polo match. The paper noted that 2,500 to 3,000 fans showed up to watch the game, despite claims of bad weather. No score or records were reportedly kept but the paper did note that the team from Queen's University outplayed the Pittsburghers, who had never played the game before.
After seeing the excitement and fan appeal of the hockey game, the Casino's management decided to organize a senior league at the rink. The league was strictly amateur and was named the Western Pennsylvania League. The league played its first season in 1896–97 at the Casino, with four teams, the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, the Duquesne Country & Athletic Club (or Pittsburgh Duquesne), Western University of Pennsylvania (the University of Pittsburgh today) and a team known as Pittsburgh, or the 'Casino' team. The Pittsburgh Athletic Club team was managed by Charles S. Miller, who became the league's president.
Championship era: 1899-1901.
The team and the league were revived by the construction of an artificial ice rink at the Duquesne Gardens. The league's second season began on January 24, 1899, when the Gardens hosted its first hockey game in a match between the Pittsburgh Athletic Club and Western University of Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Athletic Club would then go on to claim the league’s first championship. The team then won th next two titles, which resulted in being awarded the $500 Trophy, in 1900 and again in 1901
The 1901-02 season is considered the first season whereby the league and its teams were recognized as professional. The first professional ice hockey league. To fill their team the Pittsburgh Athletic Club lured players from Canada with promises of high-paid employment and small cash incentives, which was around $30 a week. Two of the players signed by the Pittsburgh Athletic Club were George Lamb and Bill Hamilton. In 1904, the Pittsburgh Athletic Club was captained by Alf Smith, a future Hall of Famer, who won four straight Stanley Cup titles as a player and coach with the Ottawa Silver Seven from 1903 to 1906.
The WPHL and its teams lasted until the end of the 1903-04 season, when the league pulled their best players to field one Pittsburgh team, the Pittsburgh Professionals, to play in the International Professional Hockey League.
Revive and quick demise.
The WPHL, along with the Pittsburgh Athletic Club team was revived in for the 1907-08 season. The team now featured several of Canada's top talent such as Albert Kerr, Ken Mallen, Garnet Sixsmith and Cyclone Taylor. However the WPHL, could no longer rely on salaries as novelty to attract Canadian talent, since professionalism had spread into Canda. Many players signed up, particular since the WPHL played on the Duquesne Gardens' artificial ice and was not dependent on cold weather to provide a naturally frozen surface, however as winter began and Canadian rinks became available, the players would just flock north to teams closer to home. This jumping effected all of the league's teams. The Pittsburgh Athletic Club itself saw the mid-season defections of stars like Cyclone Taylor and Con Corbeau to Canada. Finally, after the 1908-09 season the WPHL and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club team disbanded.

Swishing

Swishing refers to swapping an item or items of clothing or shoes or an accessory with friends or acquaintances. Parties must willingly give an item to participate in the transaction, once they have given an item they are free to choose something of interest from what others have offered. Value does not come into the equation, swappers do not necessarily get an item of equal value and are free to choose anything that the other person if offering (without having to pay). Swishing is now being more widely practiced throughout the world, and has evolved to include other items such as books and furniture. Not only do people hold 'swishing parties' either as a charity event or simply for the enjoyment of it (while recycling and saving money at the same time) but, there are several websites that have online swishes taking place.
History.
Swishing (deriving from the dictionary definition of 'to rustle, as silk' - which in the eyes of the Swishing team means 'to rustle from friends') began in 2000 when Lucy Shea, founder of green PR firm Futerra and her work colleagues wanted to come up with a way to combine a love of retail shopping without contributing to increased consumption. It has since been imbursed by fashion model Twiggy in Twiggy's frock exchange, and as a result has become one of the most popular ways of swapping clothes.

Penang Botanic Gardens

The Penang Botanic Gardens, (Malay: "Taman Kebun Bunga") also known as the "Waterfall Gardens" because of the cascading waterfall nearby, is a public park situated on Jalan Air Terjun (Waterfall Road) in George Town on Penang Island, Malaysia. The original gardens were established in 1884 from an old quarry site, under the supervision of Charles Curtis, who was the first superintendent.
History.
Prior to the establishment of the present gardens, there were two previous botanic gardens on Penang Island.
The spice gardens (1794–1806).
George Town was established on Penang Island in August 1786; the settlement enabled the East India Company to establish a strategic base to challenge the Dutch spice trade and maritime supremacy in the Straits of Malacca.
In 1794, the Company appointed Christopher Smith as Botanist to Penang to establish the spice gardens on Penang Island. Smith, who had originally trained at Kew Gardens, planted a small garden of ""20 orlongs"" ha in 1794 in the middle Ayer Itam valley and a larger garden, of ""300 orlongs"" ha, at Sungai Keluang. The exact location of both gardens is unclear.
In 1796, Smith was sent to the Moluccas, to serve as Superintendent of their Botanic Gardens and to collect specimens of nutmeg and clove for planting in the Penang Gardens. By 1800 there were some 1,300 plants in the two Penang gardens, with Sungai Keluang now predominantly growing pepper plants. That year, a delivery of a further 15,000 clove and 1,500 nutmeg trees together with Canary Nuts and Sugar Palms arrived from Ambon Island. The size of this delivery led to the enlargement of the Ayer Itam gardens and Residency grounds; as a result, Smith was instructed by Lieutenant Governor Leith to return to supervise this enterprise and cease collecting further specimens in the region. By 1802 Smith reported that there were 19,000 nutmeg and 6,250 clove trees under his supervision. In the 1804–05 financial year, the Gardens supported 80 "coolies" and an operational budget of $11,909.
Captain James Low (writing in 1836) described the Gardens during this period as: ""... embracing one hundred and thirty acres of land, lying on the slopes which skirt the base of the hill near Amie's Mills, a romantic spot and well watered by a running stream now called Ayer Putih. This plantation, in some respects a mere nursery, contained in the above year the number of 19,628 nutmeg plants, varying from one up to four years old, 3,460 being four years of age. There were also 6,259 clove trees, of which 669 were above six, and under seven years old.""
Following further collecting trips, Smith returned to George Town in 1805, accompanied by 71,266 nutmeg and 55,263 clove plants together with additional Canary Nut and Sugar Palm specimens. On his return, Smith was appointed Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens, but died unexpectedly in George Town soon afterwards. By now, George Town had been elevated to the status of India's fourth Presidency, and Lieutenant Governor Leith had been succeeded in 1803 by Colonel Robert T. Farquhar. Farquhar sold the Gardens' contents at 12 days' notice for $9,656. Most of the specimens were removed and replanted elsewhere by various purchasers.
The kitchen gardens (1822–1834).
In 1822, the then Governor of Penang, William Edward Phillips, established the second gardens, following the urging of Sir Stamford Raffles, the superintendent of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Raffles' friend, the Danish naturalist Dr. Nathaniel Wallich, recommended the appointment of Penang Free School headmaster and amateur botanist, George Porter, on a salary of $100, to manage these gardens. Porter, formerly a member of the Calcutta Gardens staff, had accompanied Wallich to Singapore in 1822. Wallich had named a dwarf "Dracaena", "Dracaena porteri", after Porter. While Porter accepted the position of superintendent he was nominally in charge under a local judge, a Mr. Leycester, who was appointed Curator. These gardens were also sited in the Ayer Itam valley; possibly on the same government land reserve as the previous gardens.
The Gardens were tended until 1834, when the then Governor Kenneth Murchison, "who took no interest in gardens or agriculture", sold them for 1250 rupees "because his wife could not get enough vegetables from the gardens to diminish her cook's bills", although the reason may also have been due to Straits Settlements cost-cutting measures executed by the Governor General Lord George Bentinck. Following the sale, Porter apparently returned to his former position as headmaster.
The present gardens.
Foundation to 1903.
In 1884 Nathaniel Cantley, Superintendent of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, established the present Botanic Gardens and appointed Charles Curtis as the Assistant Superintendent. At its inception, the Botanic Gardens Department was administered by the Gardens and Forests Department of the Straits Settlement. It was engaged mainly in the cultivation of commercial plants, inspecting crops and advising the planting community. When the work connected with economic crops and forestry were taken over by the Agriculture and Forestry Departments, Curtis made himself responsible for the layout of the Botanic Gardens and their transformation from an old granite quarry site.
Under Curtis three "Experimental Gardens" were established, including the "Waterfall Nursery Gardens" (580 m) that was developed into the present Botanic Gardens, the "Top Hill Nursery" (777 m) later renamed the "Government Bungalow Garden", and the "Plains Nursery" later comprising the Government Residency. Located at 579 m, with an average annual rainfall in the 1890s of 381 cm, the site of the Botanic Gardens embraces over 29 ha, comprising a significant middle portion, of the Waterfall River valley below the Waterfall which cascades from a height of over 120 m. The heavy rainfall often resulted in management problems, and land slips in the "steepest part of the grounds". The third Botanic Gardens were eventually sited in the Waterfall River valley on land acquired by the colonial government in 1884–85 for this purpose. Curtis records that much of this land was owned by a Mr Hogan.
On his appointment as the first superintendent of the Botanic Garden, Curtis was presented with a tropical valley, including a nutmeg plantation with associated structures, and a prominent location on the trail to and at the foot of the "Great Waterfall". While an avid and acknowledged botanist and plant collector, he proved himself to be a creative landscape designer in crafting the design and development of the Gardens.
On accepting the position, Curtis proposed a long term strategy as to the development of the gardens and its potential role as a botanical repository and clearing house. Curtis' immediate actions were to develop a plant nursery and undertake a programme of works to create a pleasurable recreational and botanical garden in the valley. This vision was spelt out in detail in his 1885 annual report to Cantley as part of the Department's Annual Report. This included proposals to extend and develop the existing "Waterfall Gardens", the construction of road circuits, the erection of plant-houses for the propagation and cultivation of various species, and the provision of recreational venues.
His immediate steps in 1885–86 were focused upon increasing the area of the Gardens in the valley together with improving road and pedestrian access. In his 1885 report, Curtis commented on ""the poor gravelly soil in the valley"" which required that considerable attention should be given to the preparation of the ground for tree planting. However, the ""natural advantages of the surroundings, from a landscape gardening point of view ... in a great measure compensate for this defect.""
From the outset, Curtis introduced aesthetic considerations into the design of the Gardens, through the strategic placement of trees and the clearance of jungle. The circular road circuits he had constructed carefully weave through the valley opening up views, framing vantage points, and providing surprises to the visitor. Curtis' design was motivated by his objective to take advantage of and exploit the natural landscape in the first instance, and then locate plantings in functional or species family associations. A later supervisor, Frederick Sydney Banfield, observed of the planting design structure established by Curtis that: ""There is little systematic arrangement even in the botanical sections, the principal aim having been to arrange the plants in such a way as to enhance the natural beauty of the Gardens"."
Curtis suffered from ill-health during his time as superintendent of the gardens, which he attributed to the quality and location of the accommodation made available to him. In March 1903, health problems caused him to take early long service leave and he formally retired on 7 December 1903, to be replaced by Walter Fox.
Since 1903.
In 1910, the Gardens were threatened by a proposal to turn the valley in which they were located into a reservoir. The Gardens were handed over to the Municipality for this purpose, but the plan was abandoned and the gardens were returned to the Government in 1912. Only a small reservoir was eventually built, at the foot of the Waterfall.
During the period 1912 to 1921, much of the efforts of Curtis and his succeeding Superintendents was left to deteriorate. However, the herbarium collection increased and more time was directed to horticulture and botanical work. In subsequent years the garden matured and took on the visual aesthetic envisaged by Curtis. Several new structures and offices were added to the gardens but its overall structure, path and road configurations, the position and form of older plant houses, and the spatial layout of much of the plantings was little changed from Curtis’ original design.
Frederick Flippance, who was appointed Assistant Supervisor in 1921, was faced with the formidable task of relaying the gardens, in addition to his advisory role on roadside trees and other planting work in the municipal area. The work of the Gardens Department began to extend to ornamental planting of Georgetown, the Governor's Residence as well as the gardens themselves. A fine formal garden was established in 1936 in the Waterfall Gardens. Flippance remained Assistant Supervisor until 1937.
The Second World War took its toll on the Gardens. Although some of the Malay staff remained with the Gardens during the Japanese occupation, lack of funds and direction, together with the accumulation of war debris, left the Gardens in a very bad state. The Japanese excavated tunnels near the lily ponds and turned them into ammunition works and storage facilities, and a torpedo assembly station.
Upon British reoccupation in 1945, much restoration and cleaning up had to be done. As part of the post war reorganisation, the Penang Botanic Gardens was separated from its parent establishment in Singapore and, in 1946, the Gardens administration passed from Singapore to the Federation of Malay States. Whilst under the direction of Frederick Sydney Banfield, the Botanic Gardens were restored to their original splendour. In 1956, the first Malaysian — Cheang Kok Choy — was appointed as Curator of Gardens, where he had previously worked as a trainee gardener. He continued to carry out the policy laid down by his predecessors until his retirement in 1976.
Today, the administration of the Gardens is the responsibility of the Penang State Government under the Pejabat Kebun Bunga (Penang Botanic Gardens Department).
The gardens today.
After the handover to the Penang State Government, the Gardens gradually eroded their role in research and botanical activities. Consequently, most of the herbarium collections of Curtis and successive superintendents were transferred to the Singapore Botanic Gardens, since when the Penang Botanic Gardens function more as a park than as botanic gardens. The Gardens' main objectives include "conservation programmes, provision of a clean, safe and conducive public recreation environment, education and raising of public awareness in the appreciation of nature and gardening". The Gardens continue some research, collaborating with other Botanic Gardens in the development and implementation of botanical and ecological research programmes both nationally and internationally.
The Penang Botanic Gardens Department aims to provide visitors with programmes that focus on the historical and cultural heritage of the gardens, the plant collections, natural landscape and rich diversity of flora and fauna. It also aims to provide professional advice related to botany, taxonomy, horticulture and landscaping.
The gardens occupy a 29 ha. site in a valley described as "an amphitheatre of hills" covered with lush tropical rain-forests. Its lush greenery and tranquil setting makes it a favourite park and a popular tourist destination. It is Penang's unique natural heritage, being the only garden of its kind in Malaysia. As well as being a repository of flora and fauna, unique to the country and to the region, it serves as a "green lung" for metropolitan Penang. As such, the garden is a popular recreational spot; some of the recreational activities include jogging, walking, jungle trekking and aerobics.
Amongst the flora in the gardens, most conspicuous are the Cannon Ball Tree ("Couroupita guianensis") and the large buttress roots of the Sengkuang Tree ("Dracontomelon dao"). There is also the Pinang Palm ("Areca catechu") that lent its name to the island of Penang, and the Black Lily ("Tacca integrifolia") with its unique purplish-black coloured flowers. The Candle Tree ("Parmentiera cereifera"), the endemic Slipper Orchid ("Paphiopedilum barbatum") and the ginger, "Geoctachys penangensis", can also be found in the gardens.
There are also collections of rare plant species housed in the Fern House, Palm Collection, Aroid Walkway, Orchidarium, Perdana Conservatory, Cactus House, Bromeliad and Begonia House, Herb Garden, Fern Rockery, Sun Rockery, and the Formal Garden.
The garden fauna include long-tailed Macaques, Dusky Leaf Monkeys, Black Giant Squirrels as well as many insects and butterflies.
The path around the Lily Pond offers access to tropical rain-forest, a short distance from the Botanic Gardens gate. The walk from the Lower Circular Road passes two prominent groups of palms and bamboo clusters along the Waterfall River. Two orchid houses provide comparison between cultivated hybrids and wild orchid species. The best time to admire the flowering trees is during the dry season, from February to April, when the Thai Bungor ("Lagerstroemia loudonii"), the Javanese Cassia ("Cassia javanica") and the Rosy Trumpet ("Tabebuia rosea") are in full flower.
From the Lily Pond path there is a climb to the site of Charles Curtis' former house, although only a few bricks can still be seen. Various hiking paths lead from the Botanic Gardens, to Penang Hill and to Mount Olivia at the north. Mount Olivia was the site of the Raffles' home and was named after Raffles' wife, Olivia.
Waterfall.
The waterfall and reservoir are private property although they can be visited by arrangement with the Penang Water Authority ("Perbadanan Bekalan Air Pulau Pinang"). The Friends of the Penang Botanic Gardens, a non-governmental organisation, organises monthly visits to the waterfall. The Penang waterfall was closed off to the public as a safety measure during the confrontation between the newly independent Malaysia and Indonesia in the 1960s.
Early visitors to Penang Island described it as one of the key attractions of the island, including Ibrahim Munshi, son of Munshi Abdullah, who described it in his journal, the ""Kisah Pelayaran"". The waterfall was an important source of water for ships calling at Penang port in the early part of the 19th century. In 1804, the first water treatment plant in Malaysia was set up here, to supply the needs of 10,000 people in Penang. In 1805, an aqueduct was constructed to channel water from the fall via Pulau Tikus to a reservoir near the port. The quality of the water, filtered through the aged rocks of Penang Hill, was very high, and was described by the early sailors as "sweet".
The oval-shaped reservoir of the Penang Waterfall was constructed in the gardens in 1892 by British engineer James MacRitchie, who was also responsible for the MacRitchie Reservoir in Singapore, built in 1894. The Penang reservoir was reconstructed in 1950.
Today, only a small proportion of the Penang water supply comes from the waterfall reservoir — approximately 10–15% of the population obtain their water from here, while most of the island's water supply comes from Sungai Muda, on the border of Penang and Kedah.

Percy Jones (rugby player)

Percy Jones (23 March 1887 – 31 March 1969) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Pontypool and Newport. He was awarded eight caps for Wales and faced the touring with South Africans. Jones was one of the 'Terrible Eight' who clashed with the Irish forwards during the 1914 Five Nations Championship.
Rugby career.
Jones played for several rugby clubs but was selected for Welsh international duty while with Newport and Pontypool. His first cap was against the 1912 touring South Africans and although Wales lost the game, he was reselected a few months later to face England in the 1913 Five Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Tommy Vile, Wales lost on home soil for the first time against England since 1895. The selectors kept faith with Jones, and played in two of the next three games of the tournament, which saw wins for Wales and Jones against Scotland and France.
In 1914, Jones was selected to play in all four matches of that year's Championship. Wales only lost one game, narrowly against eventually Grand Slam champions England. Jones was best known during this campaign for the build up to the match against Ireland. The match was to be played at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on 14 March, and the Welsh team had travelled out to Ireland the day before. Jones and fellow Newport team mate Harry Uzzell decided to visit a local theatre in the night before the match. There they were met by some of the Irish players, where they were approached by Ireland's William Tyrell, later to become Air Vice Marshall Sir William Tyrell Surgeon to George VI, who challenged Jones to a physical contest on the pitch the next day. What appeared to start as good natured banter turned into a full-blooded contest during the match. Jones took several early knocks, not just from Tyrell but from other members of the Irish pack. At half time Uzzell decided to pay the Irish back and the game descended into running fist fights and the match is remembered as being one of the most violent in international rugby. The Welsh forwards were dubbed the 'Terrible Eight' by the press after the event.

Cheadle railway station

Cheadle railway station served the English town of Cheadle, Staffordshire. It was the terminus of a branch line from Cresswell and opened in 1901.
Facilities.
The initial station buildings were of a temporary nature and a permanent structure was built in 1910. Later that year, the goods yard was expanded and the goods shed was extended. A new loading dock was also built and a crane was later provided. Cheadle station had a loop but no turntable and so most trains left Cheadle with the locomotive running "bunker first".
Later years.
Passenger services were withdrawn in 1963 as a result of the Beeching Axe. Local sand traffic from nearby quarries continued and a new road-rail loading dock replaced the goods shed in the late 1960s. Approximately 1,200 tons per day was being moved by this time but in the 1970s the amount of traffic reduced and on 6 March 1978 public freight working was withdrawn. A small amount of traffic for railway civil engineering use continued until 1986.
Charter trains were proposed in 1985 with a test train running from London Euston - Cheadle to bring passenger to Alton Tower, however they didn't take off and it was a open off.
The site today.
The only trace of the station that remains today is the station master's house; the remains of the station were demolished in 1994 to make way for a new housing development.

I Met a Whore in the Park

"I Met a Whore in the Park" (aka "Yo-Ho") is a traditional rugby song that is sung at drink ups after rugby games, or just at gatherings of different rugby teams or players. In traditional rugby songs, one line of the song is sung by an individual person, and then the rest of the people involved in the song repeat that line. The individual person usually changes throughout the group of people singing along with each verse.
This rugby song stays in tune with the standard of one person singing and a chorus following in after. Sometimes one individual will sing the original lines in all the verses instead of changing after each verse. Someone starts singing the song by saying, "I met a whore in the park one day!", then the other individuals say, "Ya ho, ya ho."

Chakacha is a traditional music and dance style (a "ngoma") of the Swahili people of coastal Kenya and Tanzania, originally associated to weddings and performed and watched by women. In the late 20th century, musical groups such as Mombasa Roots, Safari Sound Band and Them Mushrooms have adapted this style to afropop music. Basically, the women are dressed in very light transparent clothing and have a belt around their waists for ease of movement. Tanzanian ladies, especially around the coastal areas are very good at this dance. 
It is also somewhat associated with Taarab, another type of music style adapted in the coast and mainly performed by women. 
The hip-swaying dance movements of Chakacha are bear some resemblance with both Congolese soukous dances and Middle Eastern belly dances.

Life.
Clutsam was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. His career began as a pianist, at which he had little formal training. After establishing himself in Australia and New Zealand, he moved to London in 1889, where he continued as an accompanist to various artists including his fellow Australian Nellie Melba in 1893. From 1895 he increasingly moved to arrangement and composition of orchestral works and light opera.
In 1908, Clutsam married Minnie Fischer, a successful singer, also Australian. Between 1908 and 1918 he wrote music criticism for "The Observer" and "The Musical Times", while continuing to compose and arrange. In 1912, he wrote a biography of Franz Schubert. As well as the many stage works, he wrote numerous songs, including the popular (but now politically incorrect) "Ma Curly-Headed Babby". Later he became Vice-Chairman of the Performing Right Society. He also wrote music for the silent cinema, and subsequently also composed for the "talkies". 
Clutsam published under a number of pseudonyms, namely Paul Aubry, Robert Harrington, H.S. Iseledon, Georges Latour and Ch.G. Mustal.
He died in London in 1951 at the age of 85.

Los Ronisch

Los Ronisch are a Bolivian cumbia band. They originate from Cochabamba and are one of the most popular cumbia bands in South America. The press have called this band "the box-office record breakers" due to its vast popularity among people in Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Ecuador and other countries.
History.
The band is composed of six brothers:
The live concerts include an animator, German Zambrana being one of them during the late 90s.
Los Ronisch, named after the family's old German Rönisch piano, started playing in the late 80's, focusing more in a type of Rock that is similar to New Wave, with influences from disco, electronic music, and pop. One of their first hits, Isabel, remains a classic of pop music in Bolivia. This type of music regarded as "Disco" in Bolivia was also practiced by another popular Bolivian band called Maroyu. 
Towards the end of the 90's the band remained highly popular; however, it shifted the focus of its music towards Cumbia (Los Ronisch played Cumbia and Huayño regularly since their start in the late 80's). This shift to a more electronic sound, relying more heavily on the keyboards and the sampler as a backbone, made some people in Peru relate the band's style to Tecnocumbia. This shift can be heard in the "Regresa" album of 1999. The popularity of the band exponentially increased with the release of "Regresa" and the singles "Amigos Traigan Cerveza" and "Prefiero Estar Lejos", making the band play numerous cities throughout South America, USA and Europe (Spain).
Music Style.
Cumbia, Huayño, Technocumbia or Tecnocumbia, Chicha, Rock & Pop, Disco.

Preventive repression is political repression of political opponents before they actually carry out any activities that would threaten the current political system. The term was used to describe the political methods of the Paraguay "caudillo" Stroessner, whose methods of "nipping in the bud" the possibilities of any real or imagined unrest were reported at a 1972 Inter-American Defense Board meeting of US and Latin American military. 
Herbert Marcuse, in his work "Counterrevolution and Revolt" operates with the term "preventive counterrevolution".

Girondin constitutional project

The Girondin constitutional project, presented to the French National Convention on February 15 and 16, 1793, by Nicolas de Caritat, formerly the Marquis de Condorcet, is composed of three parts:
The work was signed by the eight members of the Convention's Constitution Committee: Condorcet, Gensonné, Barrère, Barbaroux, Paine, Pétion, Vergniaud and Sieyès.
Principles and motives.
In the exposition of the principles and motives behind the constitutional scheme that he reads before the National Convention, Condorcet begins, as a true mathematician, by a description of the "problem to solve":
"To give to a territory of twenty-seven thousand square leagues, inhabited by twenty-five million individuals, a constitution which, being founded solely on the principles of reason and justice, insures to citizens the fullest enjoyment of their rights; to combine the parts of this constitution, so that the necessity of obedience to the laws, the submission of individual wills to the general will, allow the subsistence in all their extent, of the sovereignty of the people, equality among citizens, and the exercise of natural liberty, such is the problem that we had to solve."
Are subsequently exposed, in this order:
Declaration of rights.
The first article declares the natural, civil, and political rights of men which are liberty, equality, safety, property, social security, and resistance to oppression.
Articles 2 to 9 treat of liberty and equality and define these two terms.
Articles 10 to 22 treat of safety and property.
Article 23 declares a right to elementary instruction.
Article 24 treat of public relief.
Articles 25 to 30 treat of social security.
Articles 31 and 32 treat of resistance to oppression.
Article 33, the last one, declares the right of the people to review, reform and modify the constitution.
Constitution.
Territory.
The territory of the French Republic keeps the preexisting 85 departments. The departments themselves are divided into large communes, which are in turn divided into municipal sections and primary assemblies.
Citizenship.
The quality of citizen is granted to men 21 year old and older, following an uninterrupted residence of one year on French soil, counting from the day of their inscription on the civic table of a primary assembly. All public offices are opened to citizens aged 25 year old and older. 
In addition to the right to vote, citizens enjoy the right to petition, and the right to censure acts emanating from their representatives.
Administration.
Each department is managed by an administrative council of 18 members, of which two form the directoire. The communes are led by a municipality administration made up of 12 members and a mayor, who chairs the administration. Communes including more than one section contain agencies subordinated to the municipality. Half of the members of the departments' administrative bodies are renewed every two years, three months after the date of the legislative elections. The mode of the municipal elections is not a constitutional law.
Electoral system.
The citizens exert their right to vote in primary assemblies including between 450 to 900 members. Each primary assembly elect a bureau responsible for the citizenship registry, for summoning primary assemblies when the constitution prescribes it and for examining ballot papers. 
The elections comprise two polls: a first one used to prepare the list of candidates being presented, and a second one used for the election of the candidates on the list drawn up by the first election. 
At the time of the first poll, voters receive from the bureau a ballot paper identified to their name. On it they write (or have someone write for them in case of illiteracy) as many names as there are offices to elect and drop their bulletin at the office. The list of presentation is formed of the names which received the most votes, and their number is triple that of the offices needing to be renewed. Are added an equal number of substitutes taken among those who obtained the most votes after the candidates. The candidates and substitutes have 15 days to desist after which the list, sorted by the number of votes and without the remaining substitutes, becomes final. 
At the time of the second poll, the voters receive a bulletin with two columns, one named "First Column of Election", the another "Additional Column", each one being divided into as many boxes as there are candidates to elect. 
If a candidate receives the majority of the votes on the first column, he is immediately elected. If not, the votes of the two columns are added and those who obtain the majority in this way are elected. The others are elected at the plurality of the votes if the offices are not all filled already.
Executive.
The executive would be made up of a council of eight members: seven ministers and a secretary. Legislation, war, foreign affairs, the navy, and public contributions would each have their own minister. A sixth minister would be responsible for agriculture, trade and manufactures and a seventh for aids, works, public buildings, and the arts. The presidency of the council would pass from one minister to another every fifteen days.
The council would be renewed by half every year and its members were to be elected for two years. Each member of the council was to be elected by a separate poll.
The legislative body would have been able to put the members of the council to trial.
Three commissaries to national treasury were to be elected for three years using the same electoral mode as that used to elect the members of the executive council.
Legislative.
The legislative body was to be unicameral and renewed during elections held on the first Sunday of May of each year. There was to be one representative per fifty thousand souls and substitutes in equal numbers. The representatives who did not sit at the end of one month would be replaced by a substitute. The representatives would have exercised the functions of president and secretaries of the legislative assembly for one month maximum. 
The constitutional law would have provided for a distinction, using several examples, between the legislative acts that would be laws and those that would be decrees, and also describe in detail the law making process.
A bureau of 13 representatives was to be formed each month to report on all bills and decrees. The members of the bureau would only have been allowed to be elected once during the same legislature.
Judicial.
Civil and criminal justice are merged into a uniform code of law for the whole republic. 
There is at least one Justice of the Peace per commune, elected for one year and rendering justice without fees by conciliation of the parties. In each department there is a civil jury composed of a director, a public rapporteur, a national commissary, and juries. The civil juries table of a department is made up twice a year by the election of one jury for each 100 citizens registered on the citizenship tables of the primary assemblies. 
In criminal affairs, capital punishment is abolished for private offences. All citizens have the right to be judged by a court made up of juries. The defendants go up in front of a first jury responsible to declare if there are grounds for lawsuit and if it is so, a second jury made of at least 12 juries declare verdict on the case. 
Judicial censors are elected every two years and are charged to break the rulings rendered by infringement of the law. 
A national jury renders verdict on the crimes of high treason determined by the penal code.
Military.
Citizens in a position to bear arms constitute the military force of the Republic. The executive council appoints generals via commission, for the time of a campaign, and in the event of war only. Citizens of the communes appoint the commanders of the national guard.
Convention.
The constitution is modified by the national convention, convened by the legislative body at every twenty years. Convention can also be proposed by any citizen or the legislative body if the majority of the citizens judges it to be necessary and approves of it by a vote in primary assemblies. The members of the legislature cannot be elected to the convention and this one cannot sit more than one year. The constitution project must be accepted by the people.
Contributions.
The people by themselves or through their representatives consents to public contributions, which are deliberated upon annually by the legislative body and cannot subsist beyond one year without an explicit renewal. The share of the product of industry or work which each citizen needs to subsist is not taxable. Departments and communes can establish particular public contributions only with the authorization of the legislative body. The accounts of the expenditure are made public.
Foreign relations.
The French Republic only makes war by the arms "for the preservation of its liberty, the conservation of its territory and the defence of its allies". War can be only be decreed by the legislative body, with the means of a signed poll, whose moment was fixed three day in advance and after "having heard the Executive Council on the state of the Republic".

Hal Roth

Hal Roth (1927 – October 18, 2008) was an American sailor and author. In 1971 he was awarded the Blue Water Medal of the Cruising Club of America. He died of lung cancer.
Hal Roth was an avid sailor and prolific sailing writer. The success of his first book, about the John Muir Trail in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, prompted him and his wife to try the precarious worlds of adventuring and writing. They quit their jobs, and began a 19 month voyage around the Pacific in a 35 foot sloop. Their vast journey culminated in the publication of his first sailing book, "Two on a Big Ocean."
He and his wife, Margaret, subsequently made a life of sailing and writing about it, including sailing around South America and a circumnavigation via Panama, the Torres Strait, and Suez. He then raced single-handedly around the world in the 1986-87 BOC Challenge, finishing fourth in a class of fourteen.
History description from The Hal Roth Papers of San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park Historic Documents Department:
Hal Roth was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1927. He was an aviator during World War II and the Korean War. During the course of his lifetime, Roth was also an author, sailor, mountaineer, and photographer. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Journalism, and became a free-lance writer and photographer. He studied photography with Edward Weston and Ansel Adams. He worked as a photographer for the American Society of Magazine Photographers based in Sausalito, California and took countless images of life in the surrounding area of California during the late 1950s and into the late 1960s. Roth's free-lance works of note include magazine titles such as Colliers, Fortune, The Saturday Evening Post, and The New York Times. Themes of his work include: California landscapes and wildlife, San Francisco (including Fisherman's Wharf), Winter Olympics, Dr. Suess, and Native American wildland firefighters of the Southwest. 
Hal was also engaged in photographic study of human life as represented by his "Time and Place" album and his Chinatown exhibit. In 1964, the San Francisco Museum of Art exhibited 40 of Roth's black and white photographic images titled "The Faces of Chinatown." Roth's first published book, "Pathway in the Sky" (1965) displays his passion for the John Muir Trail and the Sierra Mountains. The associated images of the John Muir Trail also reflect people enjoying the trail and document its use in the early 1960s.
In 1959, Roth met Margaret Hale-White from Oxford, England who was visiting a friend in San Francisco, California. Margaret was born in Bombay, India and was the daughter of an English engineer. According to Roth, she worked in Paris for six and a half years as a dual language secretary for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Sharing backgrounds in mountaineering and hiking and a love for adventure, they married in 1960. 
Even though neither was a sailor, their friends shared a love of sailing and introduced them to the sport in 1962. The couple chartered a boat in the West Indies where they learned a great deal from the captain. Later, they chartered another boat in Greece, then took sailing lessons in Scotland. After purchasing a home in Sausalito in 1964, they took a trip (1966) north along the west coast and purchased a fiberglass Spencer 35, built in Vancouver, British Columbia and designed by John Brandlmayr in Seattle, Washington. They named her "Whisper", and sailed her home to California. The Roths began sailing on their own in 1966 and completed several voyages in "Whisper". Destinations included Japan, Aleutian Islands, Alaska, Canadian islands, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Cape Horn, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Mediterranean, and Canary Islands. In 1978, they relocated to Maine. 
Roth published hundreds of articles in his lifetime. Although, his book publications appear to be his dominate body of work and document the couple's voyages and growing knowledge of sailing. The 1972 account of their first circumnavigation of the Pacific Basin (1967-8) resulted in the publication "Two on a Big Ocean". The Blue Water Medal of the Cruising Club of America was awarded to the Hal Roth, and Margaret was noted as the sole crew, for this voyage. "After 50,000 Miles" (1977) describes technical aspects of sailing. The 1978 book "Two against Cape Horn" describes their journey from California to Maine via Cape Horn. "Always a Distant Anchorage" (1988) describes their four year (1981–1985) circumnavigation west through the Panama Canal, Torres Strait, the Red Sea, and the Suez Canal. 
The couple sold "Whisper" and purchased the "American Flag" (later renamed "Sebago") and Roth then sailed solo in the Brin's or British Oxygen Company (BOC) Challenge Race of 1986-7. He completed the race 4th in his class, taking 171 days. "Chasing the Long Rainbow" (1990) is his account of this BOC race. In 1990, he tried the race again in the same Santa Cruz 50 now named "Sebago" (his sponsor), but due to capsizing, the voyage took 211 days. "Chasing the Wind" (1994)is his account of the second race. In 1992, they sold "Sebago", purchased a Pretorien 35, named her "Whisper", and the couple spent two years together tracing Odysseus' voyage through the Mediterranean. "We Followed Odysseus", "How to Sail Around the World", and "Handling Storms at Sea" represent books that he wrote based on the couple's final unique voyages.
Roth recorded reminisces and continued to draft manuscripts throughout his life. His last two works, "The Paradise Book" and "Graf Spee" were completed but never published. He worked on these manuscripts during his later years and during his two and half year battle with lung cancer. He died October 18, 2008, while living in Maryland with his wife, Margaret, who survives him.

Ilyushin Il-46

__NOTOC__
The Ilyushin Il-46 was a jet-engined bomber produced in the USSR during 1951-2, as the result of a directive to re-design the Il-42 project (half the drawings had already been completed). The revised specification was for an aircraft with twice the range and one and a half times the bomb load, with a prototype ready to be submitted for state acceptance trials in July 1952. The Ilyushin design bureau set about designing two versions of the same aircraft, straight winged (Il-46) and swept winged (Il-46S), with as much as possible common to both aircraft. To meet the schedule for State acceptance trials Ilyushin only built the straight winged version, fearing that the design, manufacture and flying characteristics of the swept winged aircraft might cause delays.
The airframe, constructed of aluminium alloy with steel used in highly stressed parts, resembled a large Il-28, the long fuselage having swept tail surfaces, and a similar arrangement of cockpits for the crew of pilot, navigator and rear gunner. The wing, which had moderate taper but straight leading edge, copied the layout of the Il-28, being mounted in the shoulder position at the midpoint of the fuselage. The flying controls consisted of the usual ailerons, elevators and rudder, all fitted with trim tabs for reducing loads on the pilots controls during flight in steady states, as well as "reversible" hydraulically powered actuators.
Two Lyul'ka AL-5 engines were fitted in long nacelles forward of the wings, exhausting through long jetpipes at the rear of the nacelles, aft of the wing trailing edge. The engines were mounted in this fashion to make room for the retracted main undercarriage legs, two on each side attached to the engine nacelles under the wings. The paired main undercarriage legs, side by side, retracted in opposite directions, inboard forwards and outboard rearwards, with the single mainwheels rotating 90 degrees to lie flat under the long jetpipes of the AL-5 engines. To boost take-off performance two JATO bottles could be attached to the rear fuselage, performance was also improved when Lyulka AL-5F (forseerovannyy - afterburning) engines were fitted.
Flight tests and State acceptance trials were successful, with the Il-46 meeting all requirements. Production was not ordered because the Tupolev Tu-88 proved to have better performance, and was ordered into production as the Tu-16.
The Il-46S swept winged version was designed concurrently, but construction was not started to ensure that resources were not diverted from the Il-46.

Kill Switch (film)

Kill Switch is a direct-to-video 2008 film that was later released for theatrical distribution starring Steven Seagal and directed by Jeff F. King. Steven Seagal plays Detective Jacob King, a tough cop with a reputation for violent street-justice methods. King investigates murders in Memphis, Tennessee, perpetrated by a serial killer known as Lazerus. The film is also notable for featuring one of the last roles of Isaac Hayes.
Plot.
Steven Seagal stars as a tough cop, Jacob King, whose brutal methods have gained him a legendary reputation among his colleagues. Seemingly indifferent to the fact his twin brother was murdered in front of him as a child, Seagal investigates a series of brutal killings, most involving young, attractive women. The murderer, Lazerus, played by Michael Filipowich, leaves cryptic, astronomical clues at the crime scenes. At the same time, another murderer, Billy Joe Hill (Mark Collie), is killing women. King finds him and kicks him out a window, after which Hill seeks revenge by murdering Celine (Karyn Michelle Baltzer), whom he believes to be King's girlfriend.
King goes on a brutal rampage through the Memphis underworld with the assistance of his partner, Detective Storm Anderson (Chris Thomas King) and the coroner (Isaac Hayes). King meets FBI agent Frankie Miller (Holly Dignard) but dislikes her because she doesn't approve of his methods. Lazerus attempts to frame King for the murder of a blonde barmaid, and Miller believes the frame and begins to pursue King. Meanwhile, King locates Lazerus and fights him, using a ball-peen hammer to break every bone in his body. He then goes after Billy Joe Hill and kills him after finding Celine dead.
King then runs away, leaving Anderson a note explaining he's quitting because no one likes his style of justice. The final scene shows King returning to what appears to be his Russian wife and family.
Theatrical release.
The film later received theatrical distribution exclusively in the UAE in 2009.
