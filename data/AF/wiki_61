Yosef Garfinkel

Yosef Garfinkel (born 1956) is a professor of Prehistoric Archaeology and of Archaeology of the Biblical Period at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Biography.
Yosef (Yossi) Garfinkel was born in 1956 in Haifa, Israel. He is a curator of the museum of Yarmukian Culture at Kibbutz Sha'ar HaGolan. Garfinkel specializes in the Protohistoric era of the Near East, the period of time when the world’s earliest village communities were established and the beginning of agriculture took place. He has excavated numerous Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites, including Gesher, Yiftahel, Neolithic Ashkelon, Sha'ar HaGolan, Tel ‘Ali and Tel Tsaf. Garfinkel is the author of 12 books and over 100 articles on ancient architecture, farming, water sources, pottery, art, religion and dance.
Since 2007 he has been conducting excavations at the fortified city of Khirbet Qeiyafa. This site is dated to the early 10th century BC, the period of the biblical King David. In the 2008 season an inscription was discovered written in ink on a pottery shard in a script which is probably Early Alphabetic/Proto Phoenician. This might be the earliest Hebrew inscription ever found, although the actual language of the inscription is still under debate.

Coutts Lindsay

Sir Coutts Lindsay, 2nd Baronet (2 February 1824-7 May 1913, Kingston upon Thames, England), was a British artist and watercolourist.
Life.
Lindsay was the eldest son of Lieutenant-General Sir James Lindsay, son of the Hon. Robert Lindsay, second son of James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres. His mother was Anne, daughter of Sir Coutts Trotter, 1st Baronet, a principal partner in Coutt's Bank. Robert Loyd-Lindsay, 1st Baron Wantage, was his younger brother. In 1839 he succeeded by special remainder to his maternal grandfather's baronetcy (which became extinct on Lindsay's own death). He then entered the army, commanding the 1st Regiment of the Italian Legion during the Crimean War before retiring from military life to devote himself to art. From 1862 to 1874 he exhibited many pictures, including various successful portraits. In 1879 he and his first wife, Lady Lindsay (of Balcarres), were both elected to membership of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours. His studio at 4-5 Cromwell Place was also used by Archibald Stuart-Wortley.
He and his first wife founded the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877 as an alternative to the Royal Academy. It was devoted to exhibiting works by the Pre-Raphaelites (then held to be too stylistically advanced for the Royal Academy) and becoming the focus of the Aesthetic Movement from then until its closure in 1890. Its inaugural exhibition on 1 May 1877 included James Whistler's "", leading to the famous libel trial between Whistler and John Ruskin. Coutts was important to the careers of Coutts' friends Whistler and George Frederic Watts in providing a sympathetic venue for the display of their work. However, the gallery declined after Lindsay separated from his first wife, and it closed in 1890. In the 30 years before her death she then lived in London and Venice, gathering a circle of friends including Alma Tadema, GF Watts and Robert Browning and collecting a number of fine paintings (some of which she left to the National Gallery). She also published several volumes of poetry, including "From a Venetian Balcony" (1903) and "Poems of Love and Death" (1907).
Marriages.
He first married in 1864 to the distinguished artist and poet Caroline Blanche Elizabeth Fitzroy (born 1844, died 10 August 1912, London), daughter of the Rt. Hon. Henry Fitzroy by his wife Hannah Mayer de Rothschild (daughter of Nathan Meyer Rothschild). Her portrait by Joseph Middleton Jopling is at the National Portrait Gallery, London.
His second marriage, in 1912, was to Kate Harriet Burfield (d. 1937).

Notified Body

A Notified Body, in the European Union, is an organization that has been accredited by a Member State to assess whether a product meets certain preordained standards. Assessment can include inspection and examination of a product, its design and manufacture. For example, a Notified Body may designate that a medical device conforms to the EU Medical Devices Directive, which defines the standards for medical devices. With this Declaration of Conformity, the manufacturer can label the product with the CE Mark, which is required for distribution and sale in the EU.
EU member states will then inform the European Commission whether a product complies with set standards or not, and the names of bodies will be disclosed.
More generally, a Notified Body is a third-party, accredited body which is entitled by an Accreditation Body. Upon definition of standards and regulations, the Accreditation Body may allow a Notified Body to provide verification and certification services. These services are meant to ensure and assess compliance to the previously defined standards and regulations, but also to provide an official certification mark or a declaration of conformity.
For instance, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) formulated a certain number of safety standards in its Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) and accredited TÜV Rheinland to provide certification services to guarantee product compliance to the defined safety regulations.

Guinnevere

"Guinnevere" is a folk song written by David Crosby in 1969. The song appears on Crosby, Stills & Nash's critically acclaimed eponymous debut album. The song is notable for its serene yet pointed melody and its unique lyrics, which compare Queen Guinevere to the object of the singer's affection, referred to as "m'lady". According to a "Rolling Stone" interview with Crosby: "That is a very unusual song, it's in a very strange tuning with strange time signatures. It's about three women that I loved. One of who was Christine Hinton, the girl who got killed who was my girlfriend, and one of who was Joni Mitchell and the other one is somebody that I can't tell. It might be my best song." The song also deals with the importance of freedom. The song seems to be written about Guinevere from the perspective of a man addressing a woman; it has been speculated that Crosby wrote Guinevere from the perspective of Lancelot of ancient Welsh lore.

Sir Charles Kemeys, 3rd Baronet

Sir Charles Kemeys, 3rd Baronet (died 1702) was a Welsh landowner in the late 17th century and early 18th century in south Wales and MP for both Monmouthshire and Monmouth Boroughs.
He was a student at Wadham College, Oxford. His father Sir Charles Kemeys, 2nd Baronet died in 1658.
Sir Charles Kemeys was MP for Monmouthshire between 1685 and 1687, High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1689 and then returned again as MP for Monmouthshire between 1695 and 1698 and MP for Monmouth Borough from 1690 to 1695.
He was also Governor of Cardiff Castle in 1702 and died in the December of that year.
His son, another Charles Kemeys (born 23 November 1688) became the 4th Baronet. He in turn was MP for Monmouthshire 1713-1715 and MP for Glamorgan 1716-1734 but died in 1735 without issue and the baronetcy became extinct.

Willie Davies (footballer)

William "Willie" Davies (10 March 1900 in Troedyrhiw – 1953) was a Welsh professional footballer and Wales international.
Career.
Davies began his career playing for local amateur sides, joining Rhymney where he once scored 61 goals in a single season. He was signed by Swansea Town in 1921, playing in every forward position for the club before settling at outside-right. He made his Wales debut while playing for Swansea but, in 1924 with the club going through financial trouble, he moved to Cardiff City. In his first season at the club he was part of the side that reached the FA Cup Final, including scoring a goal direct from a corner-kick in the quarter-final victory over Leicester City.
Unfortunately he contracted a serious chest illness soon after and missed more than a year for the club, including missing the teams FA Cup victory in 1927. He briefly returned to the side at the start of the 1927–28 season but was sold to Notts County soon after, where he spent two years before moving on to Tottenham Hotspur. He later returned to Wales to finish his league career at Swansea.
International career.
During his career, Davies won a total of 17 caps for Wales, making a goalscoring debut in a 2–0 victory over Scotland on 16 February 1924 in the 1924 British Home Championship. Davies played in the remaining two matches of the championship, scoring his second international goal in a 2–1 victory over England, as Wales won the tournament for the third time. He later also helped Wales win the British Home Championship for a second time in four years in 1928. His last goal for Wales came on 27 October 1928, when he scored twice in a 4–2 defeat to Scotland, before winning his last cap on 1 February 1930 when he played in a 7-0 defeat to Ireland.

Harvard Humanitarian Initiative

The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative (HHI) is an interfaculty Harvard University initiative dedicated to advancing research, practice, and policy in the field of humanitarian assistance. HHI’s mission is “to 
relieve human suffering in war and disaster by advancing the science 
and practice of humanitarian response worldwide.”
History and Beginnings.
In 1999, Harvard University established a program on humanitarian crises and human rights
at the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights in response to growing interest in humanitarian response. 
By 2002, the demand for technical expertise and educational and training opportunities
from NGO partners, professionals, and graduate students overwhelmed the capacity of 
the existing program. In 2005, the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative was established as a 
University-wide academic and research center to address issues of evidence-based humanitarian interest under the leadership of faculty directors Jennifer Leaning, MD, SMH and Michael VanRooyen, MD, MPH.
Affiliations.
The Initiative is supported by Harvard's Office of the Provost, and has faculty participation from the Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School, Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Harvard Business School, Harvard Law School, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard University Committee on Human Rights Studies, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, and major Harvard-affiliated medical centers including Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Children’s Hospital Boston, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
In addition, The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative maintains partnerships with major relief organizations and government agencies to improve the effectiveness of aid delivery worldwide. HHI serves as a source for technical, research, and training assistance to more than 40 humanitarian agencies and international institutions, including: American Red Cross, AmeriCares, CARE, International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC), International Rescue Committee(IRC), Médecins Sans Frontières, Oxfam America, Physicians for Human Rights(PHR), Save the Children USA, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO).
Current projects.
crisis mapping and use of information communication technology in areas of conflict worldwide.
HSI is a rigorous humanitarian response curriculum taught by Harvard University professors and humanitarian experts to train the next generation of humanitarian leaders. The flagship course teaches students skills such as refugee camp management, water sanitation, sexual violence prevention, NGO management, and international humanitarian law.

Irvinebank is a village in the western foothills of the Atherton Tablelands of Far North Queensland, Australia. It is within the local government area of Shire of Mareeba (between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Tablelands Region).
History.
First known as Gibbs Camp, the town was founded in 1884 by John Moffat, who had purchased the mining leases from the original prospectors. He built a dam, a mill, smelters and other infrastructure that attracted settlers and miners to the area.
It became a thriving town with an economy based on mining, milling and smelting. 
In the ten years up to the 1911 census the population had swelled from 619 to 1264, but another 10 years saw it reduced back to only 607 and continued to fall.
At the 2006 census, Irvinebank had a population of 311.

Chinese people in Tanzania

There were Chinese people in Tanzania as early as 1891. However, most of the Chinese in the country trace their roots to three distinct waves of migration: 1930s settlement on Zanzibar, workers sent by the Chinese government in the 1960s and 1970s as part of development assistance to Tanzania, and private entrepreneurs and traders who began doing business there during the 1990s.
History.
Most foreign labour in Tanganyika's history as a German colony came from other parts of Africa; however, there were a few Chinese as well. In 1891, the German East Africa Corporation hired 491 Chinese and Javanese labourers from Singapore to work on plantations in Usambara. Separately, a community of overseas Chinese began to form on the island of Zanzibar, by then a British possession, in the 1930s. The Chinese noodles they produced there became a popular staple food for the local population, especially for the evening "iftar" meal which marks the end of the day's fasting during Ramadan.
In 1969, a few years after Tanganyika and Zanzibar achieved independence from the British Empire and merged to become Tanzania, the People's Republic of China agreed to provide financing and technical assistance for the construction of the TAZARA Railway, intended to give Zambia an alternative to an existing railway route passing through Rhodesia, and allow them to export copper through ports in Tanzania instead. The first thousand Chinese railway workers came to Dar Es Salaam on board the ocean liner "Yao Hao" in August 1969.; they would be followed by twenty to thirty thousand more in the next five years. At any given time, Chinese composed between twenty-five and thirty percent, or 13,000, of the thirty to forty thousand workers on the railway. Most of them returned home after their stint in the country, but due to the emphasis placed on speedy construction, they had little time to train their Tanzanian counterparts to replace them; as a result, teams of Chinese experts continued to work for the railway authority as late as 2004. During these years, China also sent some advisors to Zanzibar for work on other development projects. Finally, roughly 200 doctors from Jiangsu were dispatched all over Tanzania on two-year stints; people's positive experience with these doctors laid the foundations for the later popularity of traditional Chinese medicine, though they themselves were not TCM practitioners.
The population of old overseas Chinese continued to decrease; by 2008, just twenty remained in Dar Es Salaam, including a Meixian Hakka couple from South Africa who ran a Chinese restaurant, and a number of Burmese Chinese who traced their roots to the Taishan and Kaiping counties of Guangdong. However, their numbers were bolstered by the arrival of new expatriate businessmen and entrepreneurs beginning in the 1990s.
Numbers.
There are conflicting statistics on the number of Chinese in Tanzania. In 2000, statistics of Tanzania's Immigration Department showed that they had issued work or residence permits to just 239 Chinese nationals, making them one of the smaller groups of foreigners in the country. However, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported in 2008 that 10,000 Chinese people live in the country.
Business and employment.
The new wave of Chinese expatriates in the 1990s initially came to Tanzania with the intention of working in more typical industries, such as construction, textiles, or food products. However, the World Health Organisation's push for privatisation of health care in Tanzania provided unexpected business opportunities to them; despite the fact that most lacked any medical training, they began setting up traditional Chinese medicine clinics, the first of which was established in 1996. Qualified practitioners came later, but in the early 2000s, the majority were still learning on the job.

<doc id="19999853" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19999853" title="Icelandic language">
Icelandic language

Icelandic () is a North Germanic language, the language of Iceland. It is an Indo-European language belonging to the North Germanic or Nordic branch of the Germanic languages. Historically, it was the westernmost of the Indo-European languages prior to the colonisation of the Americas. Icelandic, Faroese, Norn, and Norwegian formerly constituted "West Nordic"; Danish and Swedish constituted "East Nordic". Norwegian Bokmål later became influenced by the latter two languages, leading to the Nordic languages now being divided into mainland Scandinavian languages and "Insular Nordic" (including Icelandic).
Most Western European languages have greatly reduced levels of inflection, particularly noun declension. In contrast, Icelandic retains a four-case synthetic grammar comparable to, but considerably more conservative and synthetic than German. It is inappropriate to compare the grammar of Icelandic to that of the more conservative Baltic, Slavic, and Indic languages of the Indo-European family, many of which retain six or more cases, except to note that Icelandic utilises a wide assortment of irregular declensions. Icelandic also possesses many instances of oblique cases without any governing word, as does Latin. For example, many of the various Latin ablatives have a corresponding Icelandic dative. The conservatism of the Icelandic language and its resultant near-isomorphism to Old Norse (which is equivalently termed Old Icelandic by linguists) means that modern Icelanders can easily read the Eddas, sagas, and other classic Old Norse literary works created in the tenth through thirteenth centuries.
The vast majority of Icelandic speakers—about 320,000—live in Iceland. There are over 8,000 speakers of Icelandic living in Denmark, of whom approximately 3,000 are students. The language is also spoken by some 5,000 people in the US and by over 1,400 people in Canada, with the largest group living in Manitoba, notably Gimli ("Gimli" being an Old Norse word for 'heaven'). While 97% of the population of Iceland consider Icelandic their mother tongue, the language is in decline in some communities outside Iceland, particularly in Canada. Icelandic speakers outside Iceland represent recent emigration in almost all cases except Gimli, which was settled from the 1880s onwards.
The state-funded Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies serves as a centre for preserving the medieval Icelandic manuscripts and studying the language and its literature. The Icelandic Language Council, comprising representatives of universities, the arts, journalists, teachers, and the Ministry of Culture, Science and Education, advises the authorities on language policy. Since 1995, on November 16 each year, the birthday of 19th-century poet Jónas Hallgrímsson is celebrated as Icelandic Language Day.
History.
The oldest preserved texts in Icelandic were written around 1100 AD. Much of the texts are based on poetry and laws traditionally preserved orally. The most famous of the texts, which were written in Iceland from the 12th century onward, are the Icelandic Sagas. They comprise the historical works and the eddaic poems.
The language of the sagas is Old Icelandic, a western dialect of Old Norse. Danish rule of Iceland from 1380 to 1918 had little effect on the evolution of Icelandic, which remained in daily use among the general population.
Though more archaic than the other living Germanic languages, Icelandic changed markedly in pronunciation from the 12th to the 16th century, especially in vowels (in particular, "á", "æ", "au", and "y/ý").
The modern Icelandic alphabet has developed from a standard established in the 19th century primarily by the Danish linguist Rasmus Rask. It is ultimately based heavily on an orthography laid out in the early 12th century by a mysterious document referred to as "The First Grammatical Treatise" by an anonymous author who has later been referred to as the First Grammarian. The later Rasmus Rask standard was a re-creation of the old treatise, with some changes to fit concurrent Germanic conventions, such as the exclusive use of "k" rather than "c". Various archaic features, as the letter "ð", had not been used much in later centuries. Rask's standard constituted a major change in practice. Later 20th century changes include the use of "é" instead of "je" and the removal of "z" from the alphabet in 1973.
Apart from the addition of new vocabulary, written Icelandic has not changed substantially since the 11th century, when the first texts were committed to vellum. Modern speakers can understand the original sagas and Eddas which were written about eight hundred years ago, though this ability is sometimes overstated. The sagas are usually read with updated modern spelling and footnotes but otherwise intact (as with modern English readers of Shakespeare). With some effort, many Icelanders can also understand the original manuscripts.
Legal status and recognition.
According to an Act adopted by parliament in 2011, Icelandic is "the official language in Iceland". 
Iceland is a member of the Nordic Council, a forum for co-operation between the Nordic countries, which nevertheless uses only Danish, Norwegian and Swedish as its working languages (although the Council does publish material in Icelandic). Under the Nordic Language Convention, Icelandic citizens have since 1987 had the right to use Icelandic when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries, without becoming liable for any interpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers visits to hospitals, job centres, the police and social security offices, but remains inconsequential since it is not very well known and because many Icelanders not proficient in the Scandinavian languages have a sufficient grasp of English to communicate with institutions in that language (although there is evidence that the general English skills of Icelanders have been somewhat overestimated), and prefer to use it in those settings. The Nordic countries have committed themselves to providing services in various languages to each other’s citizens, but this does not amount to any absolute rights being granted, except as regards criminal and court matters.
Phonology.
Icelandic has very minor dialectal differences phonetically. The language has both monophthongs and diphthongs, and consonants can be voiced or unvoiced.
Voice plays a primary role in the differentiation of most consonants including the nasals but excluding the plosives. The plosives "b", "d", and "g" are voiceless and differ from "p", "t" and "k" only by their lack of aspiration. Preaspiration occurs before geminate (long or double consonants) "p", "t" and "k". It does not occur before geminate "b", "d" or "g". Pre-aspirated "tt" is analogous etymologically and phonetically to German and Dutch "cht" (compare Icelandic "nótt", "dóttir" with the German "Nacht", "Tochter" and the Dutch "nacht", "dochter").
Consonants.
The voiced fricatives , , and are not completely constrictive and are often closer to approximants than fricatives.
Grammar.
Icelandic retains many grammatical features of other ancient Germanic languages, and resembles Old Norwegian before much of its fusional inflection was lost. Modern Icelandic is still a heavily inflected language with four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive. Icelandic nouns can have one of three grammatical genders—masculine, feminine or neuter. There are two main declension paradigms for each gender: strong and weak nouns, which are furthermore divided in sub-classes of nouns, based primarily on the "genitive singular" and "nominative plural" ending of a particular noun. For example, within the masculine nouns that have a strong declension, there is a sub-class (class 1) that declines with an -s (Hests) in the genitive singular and -ar (Hestar) in the nominative plural. However there is another sub-class (class 3) of strong masculine nouns that always declines with -ar (Hlutar) in the genitive singular and -ir (Hlutir) in the nominative plural. Additionally, Icelandic permits a quirky subject, which is a phenomenon whereby certain verbs specify that their subjects are to be in a case other than the nominative.
Nouns, adjectives and pronouns are declined in the four cases, and for number in the singular and plural. T-V distinction ("þérun") in modern Icelandic seems on the verge of extinction, yet can still be found, especially in structured official address and traditional phrases.
Verbs are conjugated for tense, mood, person, number and voice. There are three voices: active, passive and middle (or medial); but it may be debated whether the middle voice is a voice or simply an independent class of verbs of its own (because every middle-voice verb has an active ancestor but concomitant are sometimes drastic changes in meaning, and the fact that the middle-voice verbs form a conjugation group of their own). Examples might be "koma" ("come") vs. "komast" ("get there"), "drepa" ("kill") vs. "drepast" ("perish ignominiously") and "taka" ("take") vs. "takast" ("manage to"). In every case mentioned the meaning has been so altered, that one can hardly see them as the same verb in different voices. They have up to ten tenses, but Icelandic, like English, forms most of these with auxiliary verbs. There are three or four main groups of weak verbs in Icelandic, depending on whether one takes a historical or formalistic view.: "-a", "-i", and "-ur", referring to the endings that these verbs take when conjugated in the first person singular present. Some Icelandic infinitives end with the "-ja" suffix, some with "á", two with "u" ("munu", "skulu") one with "o" ("þvo"-"wash") and one with "e" (the Danish borrowing "ske" which is probably withdrawing its presence). For many verbs that require an object, a reflexive pronoun can be used instead. The case of the pronoun depends on the case that the verb governs. As for further classification of verbs, Icelandic behaves much like other Germanic languages, with a main division between weak verbs and strong, and the class of strong verbs, few as they may be (ca. 150-200) is divided into six plus reduplicative verbs. They still make up some of the most frequently used verbs. ("Að vera", "to be" is the example par excellence, possessing two subjunctives and two imperatives in addition to being made up of different stems.) There is also a class of auxiliary verbs, a class called the "-ri" verbs (4-5 depending who is counting) and then the oddity "að valda" ("to cause"), called the only totally irregular verb in Icelandic, although each and every form of it is caused by common and regular sound changes.
The basic word order in Icelandic is subject–verb–object. However, as words are heavily inflected, the word order is fairly flexible and every combination may occur in poetry, i.e. SVO, SOV, VSO, VOS, OSV and OVS are all allowed for metrical purposes. However, as in German the conjugated verb in Icelandic usually appears second in the sentence, preceded by the word or phrase being emphasised. For example:
In the above examples, the conjugated verbs "veit" and "fór" are always the second element in their respective sentences.
Vocabulary.
Early Icelandic vocabulary was largely Old Norse. The introduction of Christianity to Iceland in the 11th century brought with it a need to describe new religious concepts. The majority of new words were taken from other Scandinavian languages; "kirkja" (‘church’) and "biskup" (‘bishop’), for example. Numerous other languages have had their influence on Icelandic: French brought many words related to the court and knightship; words in the semantic field of trade and commerce have been borrowed from Low German because of trade connections. In the late 18th century, language purism began to gain noticeable ground in Iceland and since the early 19th century it has been the linguistic policy of the country (see linguistic purism in Icelandic). Nowadays, it is common practice to coin new compound words from Icelandic derivatives.
Icelandic personal names are patronymic (and sometimes matronymic) in that they reflect the immediate father (or mother) of the child and not the historic family lineage. This system—which was formerly used throughout the Nordic area and beyond— differs from most Western family name systems.
Linguistic purism.
During the 18th century, a movement was started by writers and other educated people of the country to rid the language of foreign words as much as possible and to create a new vocabulary and adapt the Icelandic language to the evolution of new concepts, and thus not having to resort to borrowed neologisms as in many other languages. Many old words that had fallen into disuse were recycled and given new senses in the modern language, and neologisms were created from Old Norse roots. For example, the word "rafmagn" ("electricity"), literally means "amber power" from Greek "elektron" ("amber"); similarly, the word "sími" ("telephone") originally meant "cord" and "tölva" ("computer") is a "portmanteau" of "tala" ("digit; number") and "völva" ("seeress").
Writing system.
The Icelandic alphabet is notable for its retention of two old letters which no longer exist in the English alphabet: Þ,þ (þorn, anglicised as "thorn") and Ð,ð (eð, anglicised as "eth" or "edh"), representing the voiceless and voiced "th" sounds (as in English "thin" and "this"), respectively.
The complete Icelandic alphabet is:
The letters with diacritics, such as "á" and "ö", are for the most part treated as separate letters and not variants of their derivative vowels. The letter "é" officially replaced "je" in 1929, although it had been used in early manuscripts (until the 14th century) and again periodically from the 18th century. The letter "z", which had been a part of the Icelandic alphabet for a long time but was no longer distinguished from "s" in pronunciation, was officially abolished in 1973.
Cognates with English.
As Icelandic shares its ancestry with English, there are many cognate words in both languages; each have the same or a similar meaning and are derived from a common root.
The possessive of a noun is often signified with the ending -s like in English but never for pluralisation. Phonological and orthographical changes in each of the languages will have changed spelling and pronunciation. But a few examples are given below.

Line 1 (Naples Metro)

Line 1 (Italian: "linea uno") is a rapid transit railway line, part of the Naples Metro in Naples, Italy. It connects 17 stations, and is operated by Metronapoli. 
The line is in the process of being upgraded. When the upgrading works are completed, Line 1 will connect 26 stations and form a circular loop, and bring easier access to the city centre for residents of Chiaiano, Piscinola, and Scampia.
The line has been renamed "Metrò dell'Arte" (Metro of Art) because of the contemporary art works installed in its stations. 
History.
Planning for Line 1 began in 1963, when the "Ente Autonomo del Volturno" (EAV) proposed a new funicular line to connect Vomero with the Museum. However the "Commissione Comunale dei Trasporti" (Municipal Transportation Commission) decided to investigate alternative possibilities to a funicular line. After several years of discussions, in 1966 the EAV proposed the construction of a metro system connecting Piazza Matteotti with Piazza Medaglie d'Oro, with provision for further extension to the Hospital in Colli Aminei.
The following year the council approves the EAV's "white paper" for the project. By 1968 a commission had been undertaken to plan and study possible routes and station locations, and they determined that the subway would be about 4.5 km long and have 12 stations, with an average distance between stations of 375 m. On the day the project was due to be approved by the council, the EAV attempted to submit an updated version of the draft asking for concessions for construction and operation but was refused, and the project immediately stalled.
A further year and a half passed with no progress made. By 1971 the Azienda Trasporti Milanesi (Transport Agency of Milan) had become involved, assisting "Azienda Napoletana Mobilità" (Transportation Agency of Naples) in trying to formulate an alternative draft plan. Submissions made in both 1970, and 1971 for further funding towards construction were both refused. A breakthrough was achieved in 1972, with a funding of 42 million lire approved, on the proviso that the line be extended to connect Naples central railway station.
As a result of the breakthrough, in 1972, "Metropolitana di Napoli" was formed with 1,2 million lire of operating capital and a new revised proposal for the project was submitted. However, despite the earlier promises that were made, the Italian government decided to block the funds. By 1974 it was decided that the responsibility for funding the project should fall on the regional government, not the Italian government. A new budget of 10 million lire was made available. On Christmas Eve 1974, the new proposals were finally given approval. Between 1975 and 1977 the project was again delayed as an Interministerial Commission was conducted as part of governmental scrutiny processes. In 1976 the municipal council finally granted the money to implement the project and the foundation stone for Medaglie d'Oro station was laid on 22 December 1976.
In 1978 it was decided that the line could be extended to Scampia and Piscinola, and the funding was provided by the European Community. By 1980, the line had reached Piazza Vanvitelli, but on 23 November of that year, the Irpinia earthquake struck nearby Conza, causing terrible damage and loss of life. It was then advised that plans would have to be adapted to deal with possible future earthquakes. The European Union funded 33% of the total expenditure for this additions to the plans. However in the mid 1990s it emerged that elements of the Camorra had been involved in syphoning millions of lire of this funding. 
In 1983 further funding issues continually blocked and delayed construction work, and in 1984 the council was forced to apply for loans for the continuation of construction.
The following year the contract for the construction of the stretch from Colli Aminei to Piscinola proceeded, with funds allocated by the "Comune di Napoli" council and Campania regional government, and in May 1985 the stretch between Piazza Medaglie d'Oro and Colli Aminei. Between 1986 and 1988 sections of line from Colli Aminei to Vanvitelli, Piscinola and Salvator Rosa all opened.
After thirteen years of work, the first section of Line 1 opened on 23 March 1993. Planning first began in the 1963 and construction commenced in the 1985 between the stations of "Vanvitelli" and "Colli Aminei". On 19 July 1995 it was extended to "Piscinola - Scampia".
A large length of Line 1 runs along the coast of the Bay of Naples, and some is parallel to the ancient city wall. Much of the area through which it has been constructed is archaeologically rich, and many objects have been recovered during its construction. Currently these objects are displayed in Museo station, and it is planned for further such exhibits at Duomo and Municipio (both due to open in late 2013). The Duomo station is also expected to include the remains of an ancient Roman temple.
In 2001, it was extended from "Vanvitelli" to "Museo" (at the National Archaeological Museum) where it connects with "Piazza Cavour" on Line 2 by a long underground walkway. It was extended to "Dante" in the heart of the city centre in 2002. An intermediate station was opened at "Materdei" in 2003. 
Future.
The line is currently being extended to Trenitalia's main Naples station at "Piazza Garibaldi", passing through the port area where it will interconnect with the proposed Line 6 at "Municipio" (Town Hall). This is due to open in 2013. Extension work is also underway between "Piscinola" and "Capodichino" (Naples International Airport). The extensions are planned to incorporate an 8-shaped inclinational loop which will climb up to 250m above the city centre, making it the steepest underground climb in the world.
A proposal exists for completing the circle between "Capodichino" and "Piazza Garibaldi", due to open after 2013. A proposal for a spur line from Piscinola to Giugliano is under development.

André Okombi Salissa

André Okombi Salissa is a Congolese politician. A member of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), he served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville from 1997 to 2012. He is the President-Coordinator of the Action Committee for the Defense of Democracy - Youth Movement (CADD-MJ).
Political career.
Okombi Salissa was born at Lekana, located in the Plateaux Region of Congo-Brazzaville; he is an ethnic Téké. He participated in the June–October 1997 civil war on the side of opposition leader Denis Sassou Nguesso, helping to lead Sassou Nguesso's rebel Cobra militia.
The Cobra militia prevailed in October 1997, capturing Brazzaville and returning Sassou Nguesso to power. As President, Sassou Nguesso appointed Okombi Salissa as Minister of Technical and Vocational Education on 2 November 1997. Okombi Salissa's portfolio was expanded on 12 January 1999, when he was appointed as Minister of Technical and Vocational Education, in charge of the Redeployment of the Youth, Civic Instruction, and Sports. In the 2002 parliamentary election, he was elected to the National Assembly as the PCT candidate in Lekana constituency; he defeated Minister of Public Works Florent Ntsiba in the second round of voting, held in June 2002.
After the 2002 election, Okombi Salissa remained in the government and was moved to the post of Minister of Labour, Employment, and Social Security on 18 August 2002. He was accordingly succeeded by Pierre-Michel Nguimbi at the Ministry of Technical and Vocational Education on 23 August 2002, and he in turn succeeded René-Dambert Ndouane at the Ministry of Labour on 26 August 2002. The newspaper "Le Choc" reported on 20 July 2004 that Okombi Salissa, together with three former ministers, had been barred from leaving the country without Sassou Nguesso's approval due to suspicions that they had misused public funds. This report was denied on the next day by public prosecutor Georges Akiéra.
Okombi Salissa was moved from his post as Minister of Labour, Employment, and Social Security to that of Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation on 7 January 2005, and he succeeded Isidore Mvouba at the head of the Ministry of Transport on 25 January. Two years later, on 3 March 2007, he was instead appointed as Minister of Tourism and the Environment; following that appointment, he was succeeded as Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation by Emile Ouosso on 12 March 2007. As a result of Okombi Salissa's appointment as Minister of Tourism and the Environment, he became President of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) because AMCEN was chaired by Congo-Brazzaville at that time.
In the June–August 2007 parliamentary election, Okombi Salissa was again elected to the National Assembly as the PCT candidate in Lekana; he won the seat in the first round with 91.34% of the vote. Following the election, he remained Minister of Tourism and the Environment in the government appointed on 30 December 2007. He was President of AMCEN until its 12th Session in June 2008, when South Africa assumed the presidency instead.
As of 2007, Okombi Salissa was the President-Coordinator of the Action Committee for the Defense of Democracy - Youth Movement (CADD-MJ), a political association affiliated with the PCT; he also served as the PCT's Permanent Secretary for Youth, Categorical Unions, and Associated Movements. At CADD-MJ's Second Ordinary Congress in December 2007, he was re-elected by acclamation as President-Coordinator of the Central Council of the CADD-MJ.
The CADD-MJ has been critically characterized as a "private militia", and Okombi Salissa described as an occultist. Okombi Salissa owns a number of properties in Brazzaville, including a hotel in the Moungali district called "Les Bourgeois".
At the time of the July 2009 presidential election, Okombi Salissa was Head of the Voter Mobilization Department for Sassou Nguesso's re-election campaign. After Sassou Nguesso won re-election, he moved Okombi Salissa to the post of Minister of Technical and Vocational Education, Skills Training, and Employment on 15 September 2009. At the PCT's Sixth Extraordinary Congress, held in July 2011, Okombi Salissa was elected to the PCT's 51-member Political Bureau.
In the July–August 2012 parliamentary election, Okombi Salissa was again elected to the National Assembly as the PCT candidate in Lekana; he won the seat in the first round of voting. Following the election, Okombi Salissa was dismissed from the government on 25 September 2012 after 15 years of continuous service; he was succeeded by Serge Blaise Zoniaba at the Ministry of Technical and Vocational Education on 27 September 2012.
The CADD-MJ was dissolved in 2013, effectively leaving Okombi Salissa in the political wilderness, although he remained on the PCT Political Bureau and was a Deputy in the National Assembly. Subsequently he purportedly planned to stand as a presidential candidate in the 2016 election, although reaction to his purported plans was generally dismissive. He was indefinitely suspended from the PCT Central Committee in December 2013 for failing to engage in party work and instead working with other organizations.

SB-271,046

SB-271,046 is a drug which is used in scientific research. It was one of the first selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonists to be discovered, and was found through high-throughput screening of the SmithKline Beecham Compound Bank using cloned 5-HT6 receptors as a target, with an initial lead compound being developed into SB-271,046 through a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study. SB-271,046 was found to be potent and selective "in vitro" and had good oral bioavailability "in vivo", but had poor penetration across the blood–brain barrier, so further SAR work was then conducted, which led to improved 5-HT6 antagonists such as SB-357,134 and SB-399,885. 
SB-271,046 was found to increase levels of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters glutamate and aspartate, as well as dopamine and noradrenaline in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats, and 5-HT6 antagonists have been shown to produce nootropic effects in a variety of animal studies. Suggested applications of these drugs include treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.

Schloss Vollrads

Schloss Vollrads is a wine estate in the Rheingau wine-growing region in Germany, that has been making wine for over 800 years.
History.
After the donation of Verona in 983 the archbishopric of Mainz, the new owner, invested in vine growing, although vines had been cultivated there since Roman times. The manor house was named after the Lords of Winkel; Vollradus is a given name. In 1218 a "Vollradus in Winkela" (so-called knight Vollradus), in 1268 a "Conradus dictus Vollradus armiger" is documented. No building originating from this time is traceable.
Today the core building of the estate is a substantial tower house, surrounded by a square moat. Therefore the house is only reachable by bridge. This keep can be traced to the first third of the 14th century and the family of Greiffenclau, the heirs of the Lords of Winkel. The octagon stage tower, flanking the donjon, was erected in 1471; the bay window was added in 1620. Above the doorway the coat of arms of the Greiffenclau family is to be seen.
In 1684 the present two-winged manor house was built by Georg Phillip Greiffenclau von Vollrads near the tower. His son Johann Erwein erected the estate buildings around 1700, as well as boundary walls around the manor garden, and finally equipped the tower with a typical baroque roof.
In 1907/1908 Countess Clara Matuschka-Greiffenclau had the buildings remodelled. She increased the height of the southern wing of the mansion by a third floor, added two towers with an onion dome, and enlarged the terraces and the bay windows at the Donjon.
In 1975 Erwein Matuschka Greiffenclau took charge of the property, which was heavily in debt. Although an important figure in the emergence of a new or rediscovered style of high quality dry Rheingau wine in the 1980s and 1990s, he was not successful in reorganising his estate. When in 1997 the principal bank decided on the declaration of bankruptcy, Erwein, who was then also the chairman of the VDP-Rheingau, took his gun, went to his beloved vineyards, and committed suicide. Since then, the estate has belonged to the Nassauische Sparkasse bank, which runs the manor house as well as the vineyards and a restaurant.
The winery is a member of the Verband Deutscher Prädikats- und Qualitätsweingüter.
Most of the time the manor house is not open to the public. Access is only allowed for special events. In the summer live music acts take place, especially of the Rheingau Musik Festival, and in the harvest season a public bar is opened in the center court.
Geography.
Schloss Vollrads is a vineyard site documented since the Middle Ages in the Rheingau within the boundaries of the collective site ("Großlage") of Honigberg between Johannisberg, Winkel, Mittelheim and Erbach. The estate claims to be the oldest winery of Germany, which is not verifiable for the distinct single vineyard site ("Einzellage") of 58 ha size.
Schloss Vollrads is in fact a vineyard designation ("Einzellage") in its own right (as is Schloss Johannisberg), and one of a handful historic German vineyards which according to the wine law do not have to display a village name, which otherwise would be Winkel, on the label. Thus, the wines are simply labelled as "Schloss Vollrads Riesling", which signifies both the vineyard site, the producer and the grape variety.
The Riesling grape is the only grape variety used in the winery. Nevertheless the whole range of Prädikat designations such as Kabinett, Spätlese, Auslese, Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese up to the Eiswein is vinified. Schloss Vollrads also produces dry wines under the Erstes Gewächs designation. The Vollrads Lage is highly ""terroir"-expressive", meaning that the character of Riesling wines is clearly influenced by the wine's place of origin. In order to avoid "cork taint", the wine is sealed with Vino-Lok glass stoppers.
Visitors.
The estate offers guided tours with tastings, a wine bar, shop, and various special events. It is a regular concert stage for the Rheingau Musik Festival.

Career.
He debuted in the Argentine Open in 1999, taking part every year since then. After losing the Argentine Open finals in 2005 and 2007 in extra-time only, his team Ellerstina was considered a strong rival for the La Dolfina Polo Team and in 2008 met the expectations by beating La Dolfina 13-12 through a golden goal in an extra-chukka, which was made by Gonzalo.
Other teams Gonzalo played for include Audi, Loro Piana, Outback, Ellerston and Black Watch. He has won tournaments in Sotogrande (Spain), Deauville (France) and England.

Final.
The race was delayed five hours to wind gusts of 40 mph (64 km/h), which happened three times in the event alone. Because of the winds, the waters were as choppy as those used for the whitewater course. Australia moved from third to first with 50 meters left only to have the Hungarians surge ahead at the finish to win the race. The winning time was 16 seconds slower than that of the qualifying heats four days earlier thanks to the adverse weather conditions.

Brian Birch

Brian Birch (born 18 November 1931 in Salford, Lancashire; died in South Africa) was an English footballer who played for several English clubs in the late 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s.
Birch joined Manchester United as a 14-year-old in May 1946, before turning professional two years later. He was 17 when he made his debut on 27 August 1949, playing at inside left in a 1–1 home draw with West Bromwich Albion. Birch was always on the fringes of the United first team, but apart from a spell midway through the 1950–51 season in which he scored four goals in nine appearances, he never lived up to his potential and was sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers for £10,000 towards the end of the 1951–52 season. His tenure at Wolves was short, however, and he was transferred to Lincoln City after just nine months in the West Midlands.
In three years with Lincoln, Birch played in more than fifty matches, scoring 15 goals. He then dropped out of league football for a season in 1955, joining Boston United, before moving to Barrow in 1956. He became a first team regular at Barrow, making 60 appearances and scoring 27 goals in just over two seasons there. Exeter City signed him in September 1958, but he was on the move again in January 1960, this time to Oldham Athletic. He moved to Rochdale in March 1961, before going into coaching at the end of the 1961–62 season.
He dipped in and out of playing for the next few years, picking up appearances for Boston United, Mossley and Ellesmere Port, but his coaching experience eventually led him to Blackburn Rovers in 1967, where he became the coach to one of the club's junior teams.
Birch was trainer of Galatasaray from 1970 till 1973. He won three consecutive championships with Galatasaray in Turkish First League and Helsingborgs IF.

2008–09 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings

Two human polls made up the 2008–09 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings, the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll, in addition to various publications' preseason polls.
AP poll.
The Associated Press (AP) preseason poll was released on October 31, 2008. This poll is compiled by sportswriters across the nation. In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play. Generally, all top 25 teams in the poll are invited to the NCAA basketball tournament, also known as "March Madness".
ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.
The Coaches Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. Any team receiving votes after the top 25 are listed after the top 25 by their point totals. However, these are not real rankings: They are not considered #26, #27, etc. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775. The preseason poll was released on October 30, 2008.

Io senza te

"Io senza te" (Me without you) is a song by Peter, Sue and Marc, performed in Italian, that represented Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 1981. 
Peter, Sue & Marc represented Switzerland at the Contest on four separate occasions, each time singing in a different language; in 1971 with "Les illusions de nos vingt ans" in French, in 1976 with "Djambo, Djambo" in English, in 1979 with "Trödler und Co" in German and finally in 1981 with "Io senza te" in Italian, a record in Eurovision history.
The song was written by Peter Reber and Nella Martinetti. It was performed 19th on the night of the contest, following Cyprus' Island with "Monika" and preceding Sweden's Björn Skifs with "Fångad i en dröm". It received 121 points, receiving five 12-points (the most in the contest), placing 4th in a field of 20, the best-placed song by the trio in the contest.
The song was succeeded as Swiss representative at the 1982 contest by Arlette Zola with "Amour on t'aime".

List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients of the Waffen-SS

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German: "Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes") and its variants were the highest award in the military of the Third Reich. During or shortly after World War II, 457 German servicemen of the "Waffen-SS", including volunteers and conscripts from Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Latvia, Netherlands and Norway, received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Of these, 411 presentations were formally made and evidence of the award is still available in the German National Archives. One recipient, Hermann Fegelein, was court-martialed and executed on 29 April 1945. According to German law he was deprived of rank and all awards previously. Fegelein must therefore be considered a de facto but not de jure recipient. A further 46 Knight's Cross, 8 Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and 4 Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords recipients are either lacking the evidence to sustain their listings or received the award under questionable legal terms. However, all of them were accepted by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients ("Ordensgemeinschaft der Ritterkreuzträger des Eisernen Kreuzes e.V.") as legitimate recipients.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four enactments. The first enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573" of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. As the war progressed, some of the recipients distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross ("Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub") was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849" of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613" of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ("Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern") and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds ("Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten"). At the end of 1944, the last and final grade, the Knight's Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds ("Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten"), based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11" of 29 December 1944, concluded the variants of the Knight's Cross.
The "Oberkommando der Wehrmacht" kept separate Knight's Cross lists, one for each of the three military branches, "Heer" (Army), "Kriegsmarine" (Navy), "Luftwaffe" (Air force) and for the "Waffen-SS". Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade.
Recipients.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross is based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573" of 1 September 1939 "Verordnung über die Erneuerung des Eisernen Kreuzes" (Regulation of the renewing of the Iron Cross). The list is initially
sorted alphabetically.

Transport of concentration camp inmates to Tyrol

In late April 1945, close to the end of the Second World War in Europe, the government of Nazi Germany ordered that a number of high-profile prisoners should be moved to "Alpine Fortress", away from the advancing Western Allies. Eventually the inmates were liberated from their SS guards by regular German troops.
Transfer and liberation.
On 17, 24 and 26 April 1945 141 prisoners from Dachau Concentration Camp were transferred to “Arbeitserziehungslager Reichenau”, Innsbruck, Austria. But the camp was not prepared to keep the prisoners. Instead the prisoners were sent to a hotel near Niederdorf/Hochpustertal 70 km northeast of Bozen, Italy, where they arrived on 28 April. 
The transport, which was composed of trucks and old buses, was guarded by several dozen troops from the SS and SD. On board were the camp's most important and prominent prisoners as well as family members of the 20 July plotters. The officers in charge, Obersturmführer Edgar Stiller and Untersturmführer Bader, had orders to kill all the prisoners if in any fear of capture.
Contrary to expectations, the Pragser Wildsee Hotel was unavailable as it was being used by three German Wehrmacht generals. A delegation from the prisoners' committee—that included Colonel Bogislaw von Bonin who had been imprisoned for allowing a retreat on the Eastern Front—made contact with the Wehrmacht HQ in Bozen and made known the identity of the high-status prisoners and the fear that they were to be executed before liberation by US troops. 
A message was sent to Wehrmacht troops at Sexten 17 km east of Niederdorf commanded by Captain Wichard von Alvensleben, who decided to come and protect the prisoners with his soldiers. 
On 30 April against the background of advancing US troops and Alvensleben’s unit, which had now surrounded the village, the SS guards decided to escape.
The freed prisoners were then accommodated at the Pragser Wildsee Hotel until the US Army reached Niederdorf on 4 May, 1945.

18XX games

18XX games are a group of train games which recreate the building of railroad corporations during the 19th century. Other games which use similar mechanics are also included in this category. (Many titles are out-of-print and difficult to find.)
"1800".
Colorado, published 2002 by David Methany in "Rail Gamer" #17, designed by Antonio Leal
"1824".
"1824" was published by Double-O Games in 2005. The game was designed by Lonny Orgler and Helmut Ohley, and is set in Austria-Hungary. It is a smaller and simpler version of Lonny's 1837, and adds some ideas from his later 1854 and Helmut's 1844.
"1825".
Great Britain, released 1995 (Unit 1) by Hartland Trefoil, 2000 (Unit 2) and 2004 (Unit 3) by Tresham Games, designed by Francis Tresham.
"1826".
"1826" was published by Chris Lawson in 2000 and Deep Thought Games in 2004 and set in France and Belgium. As David Hecht's first design, it is the most conventional, and only one to use "traditional" green and brown plain track upgrade tiles. 1826 started out as ""1830" on a different map", but rapidly evolved into a game of capital and technology management: the game's key decisions revolve around when to "grow" a company, and which trains to buy to optimize a company's final position.
"1829 Mainline".
England, released 2005 by Tresham Games, designed by Francis Tresham.
"1829 (South)" and "1829 (North)".
"1829 (South)" was the first game in the 18XX series, published by Hartland Trefoil Ltd (UK) in 1974 from an original design by Francis Tresham. A second version, "1829 (North)" was published in 1981.
"1830".
"1830" was published by Avalon Hill in 1986, and its popularity led to the creation of many other 18XX games.
"1832".
"1832" was published by Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by Bill Dixon and is set in the Southeastern United States. It retains the new rules Bill introduced in 1850 and 1870 for share price protection, stock redeeming, and reiussing, while adding new rules to model the mergers that shaped the South's railroads.
"1835".
"1835" was designed and published by Hans im Glück in 1990 and distributed in the United States by Mayfair Games. The game board covers most of Germany. It was the first 18XX game use the concept of 'minor' companies, which operated like the normal stock companies (with some limitations) but are owned by a single person like a private company.
"1837".
Austria-Hungary, released and designed 1994 by Lonny Orgler
"1837SX".
Saxony, self-published in 2003 by Wolfram Janich
"1838".
Rheinland, self-published in 2001 by Wolfram Janich
"1839".
Netherlands, self-published in 1993 by Paul Stouthard and Rob van Wijngaarden
"1841".
1841 was published by Chris Lawson in 1996. The game was designed by Federico Vellani with assistance from Manlio Manzini and is set in Italy. With its complicated financial rules and very steep train gradient (i.e., the trains get very expensive very quickly), it emphasizes stock manipulation and funding train purchases over route building.
"1842".
Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein, self-published in 1995 by Wolfram Janich
"1844".
"1844" was designed and published by Helmut Ohley in 2003. Peter Minder collected extensive background material and drew the map.
"1846".
"1846" was published by Deep Thought Games in 2005. The game was designed by Thomas Lehmann and is set in the Mid-western United States. It features a linear stock market (like 1829), "n"/"m" trains (which count "n" cities but may run through "m" total cities) and a simplified private company distribution. Another unusual feature is that the number of corporations, private companies, and the bank size all scale with the number of players, and the resulting game is shorter than most 18XX games.
"1847".
Germany-Pfalz, self-published in 1996 by Wolfram Janich
"1849".
Sicily, released 1998 by Chris Lawson, designed by Federico Vellani
"1850".
"1850" was published by Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by Bill Dixon and is set in the upper Midwest United States. It retains the rules Bill introduced in 1870 for share price protection and stock redeeming/reissuing.
"1851".
Tennessee, released 1998 by Chris Lawson, designed by Mark Derrick and Chris Lawson
"1853".
India, released 1989 by Hartland Trefoil, designed by Francis Tresham
"1854".
"1854" was published by both Lonny Orgler in 2002 and Deep Thought Games in 2005. The game was designed by Lonny Orgler and is set in Austria. It features a hexagonal stock market, local railways which operate on a smaller map (which takes place on two hexes of the large map), mail contracts, 150% capitalization, and player share options. There are also tunnels which allow you to build under other track and terrain features, such as avoiding small cities. The local railways eventually grow up to be regional railroads operating on the main map, and the tradeoff between getting good revenues on the local map versus getting locked out of important locations on the main map is an important decision to make.
"1856".
"1856" was published by Mayfair Games. The game is set in Upper Canada, including the upper reaches of the St. Lawrence River, and the Toronto to Detroit area for southern Ontario.
"1860".
Isle of Wight, released 2004 by JKLM Games, designed by Mike Hutton
"1861".
Russia, released by JKLM Games and Lookout Games, designed by Ian D. Wilson
"1862".
"1862" was designed and published by Helmut Ohley in 2002. The game covers the entire width of the United States and parts of Canada.
"1862: Railway Mania in the Eastern Counties".
East Anglia, England; in development (~2011) by Mike Hutton
"1870".
Mississippi Valley, United States, released 1995, designed by Bill Dixon and published by Mayfair Games
"1889".
"1889" was published by both Wild Heaven Productions in 2004 and Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by Yasutaka Ikeda and is set in Shikoku, Japan. The rules for 1889 are essentially the same as "1830", except on a much smaller and terrain-heavy map and different privates. The goal is to make a quick and relatively simple game which explores the history of railroads on Shikoku.
"1890".
Osaka Japan, released 1999 by Nobuhiro Izumi, designed by Shin-ichi Takasaki
"1895".
Namibia, released 2005, designed by Helmut Ohley and Adam Romoth
"1898".
France, self-published in 1999 by Michael Brünker
"1899".
China and Korea, released by Chris Lawson, designed by Dirk Clemens and Ingo Meyer
"18??".
A variant of 1870 played on a somewhat larger fictionalized map, with additional privates and other rules variations. Designed by Allen Sliwinski and self-published by Scott Peterson.
"18AL".
"18AL" was self-published by Mark Derrick in 1999 and later by John David Galt. It is set in Alabama, United States and aims to provide a quicker and simpler introduction to the 18XX series. It is very similar to 18GA.
"18C2C".
"18C2C" (AKA ""Coast to Coast"") was published by Designs in Creative Entertainment in 2003. The game was designed by Mark Frazier and covers the entire United States and Southern Canada. This is an extremely large game that attempts to model the entire history of railroading in the United States, and accordingly takes a long time to play. It consists of a 38"x68" map, 34 public companies, 18 private companies, and 108 trains.
"18EU".
"18EU" was published by Deep Thought Games in 2004. The game was designed by David G.D. Hecht, and is set in the heart of Europe, reaching from Paris and London to Rome, Budapest and Warsaw. 18EU is a compact game, played on four map panels. Unlike most 18XX games, there are no private companies, and before the sale of the first 5 train, share companies may only be started indirectly. When the game starts, fifteen minor companies (similar to the "forerunner" companies in 1835, 1837 and 1824) are auctioned off. These companies represent regional or private-sector rail companies. There are eight possible share companies, and before the first 5 train at least one minor company must be merged into a share company to form it.
"18FL".
"18FL" was published by Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by David G.D. Hecht and is set in Florida, United States. It is very similar to Mark Derrick's 18AL and 18GA in that it is a simple game intended as an introduction to the 18XX game system for new players. Unlike 18AL or 18GA, the "ultimate" train is a 6 (or a 3E) train. This means that 4 trains never become obsolete, and the greatest difficulty in a small game (and the greatest deterrent for new players), a massive "train rush" when permanent trains are first available, is substantially mitigated.
"18GA".
"18GA" was self-published by Mark Derrick in 1998 and later by John David Galt. It is set in Georgia, United States and aims to provide a quicker and simpler introduction to the 18XX series. It is very similar to 18AL.
"18GL".
"18GL" was published by Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by Gary Mroczka and is set in the Great Lakes area, United States. It uses basically the same rules as David G.D. Hecht's 1826 (specifically, H-trains, loans, trainless companies get merged into a government railroad) except that there are no destinations, there is only one merger, and instead of TGV trains there are Diesel trains. The map is quite different, and the private companies have the effect of altering how the map develops depending on the combinations of private companies and corporations particular players get.

"18MEX".
"18MEX" was published by Deep Thought Games in 2005. The game was designed by Mark Derrick and is set in Mexico. It features a government railroad that optionally absorbs only one company (with additional limits on which companies may merge into it), so it can be dangerous to plan on being able to get rid of a trainless company through merger. Like most of Mark's games, dot-towns don't count against trains, so part of the strategy is arranging to pick up as many of them as possible while still getting through important cities. In addition, there are three minor companies which operate under restricted rules in the early game.
18MEX has one of the fiercest train rushes of all the 18xx games, second only to 1841. The action start when the first 4-train is bought. This has several effects to the game. One of it is that it effectively rusts all the 2-trains. Another is the one train per turn limit is lifted, so corporations may buy as many trains as their funds and corporate charters permit on each subsequent operating round. However the real action starts when the second of the two 5-trains is bought. The next set trains is a pair of 6-trains. The first 6-train rusts all the 3-trains in play, while the second 6-train will obsolete all the 4-trains in play. The price of the next set of trains (4D-trains) is set at 700 pesos.
This fierce train rush coupled with the extremely high track building cost (98% of the board is covered in difficult terrain and some track upgrades requires money as well) will see almost half of the corporations in play unable to buy the next train when their trains become rusted at an alarming rate.
Also, there are only 11 permanent trains available but there are 8 corporations. All corporations have a train limit of 2 except for NdM which has a train limit of 3. This means that some corporations will most likely end up without any trains to operate.

"18Scan" was published by Deep Thought Games in 2005. The game is one of the smaller 18XX titles, and was designed by David G.D. Hecht in order to introduce gamers to some of the more "exotic" systems used in other designs. "18Scan" includes "1835"-style minor companies, an "1835"-style merger corporation, "1870"-style destination rules (for the minor companies), "1856"-style company flotation rules, and market-priced incremental capitalization rules as in "1851" and "1826".
"18TN".
"18TN" was published by Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by Mark Derrick originally in 1996, and upon discussions with Chris Lawson it was modified and published by Chris as 1851 in 1998. The two games were sufficiently different to warrant the publication of the original.
"18US".
"18US" was published in 2006 by Deep Thought Games. The game, designed by David G.D. Hecht as an "advanced" 18XX game, is set in the continental United States. Unlike 18C2C or other, similar products, it is a very compact game: the entire "Lower 48" only takes up two map panels.
"18VA".
"18VA" was published by Deep Thought Games in 2005. The game, designed by David G.D. Hecht, is a smaller 18xx game, originally intended to be similar in scope to Mark Derrick's "one-state" games "18AL" and "18GA". Set in Virginia and Maryland, it is slightly more complex than either of the above.
"18West".
"18West" was published in 2007 by Deep Thought Games. The game, designed by David G.D. Hecht, is set in the western United States. Many of the mechanics are quite different from other 18XX games.
"2038".
"2038" has the game mechanics of an 18XX railroad game, but with an asteroid mining theme. Its mechanics are fairly close to those of "1835", including a set of minor companies and a big merger company. Specific features are changes in the values of mines (the equivalent of cities), a small fee for companies which explore asteroïds (the equivalent of laying a tile, but needs a spaceship/train), and two different ways of starting companies (direct start with full monetary assets, or "growth companies", that start quicker but with smaller assets).
"Poseidon".
Aegean Sea, designed by Helmut Ohley and Leonhard "Lonny" Orgler, and drawn by Klemens Franz, and published through Lookout Games and Z-Man Games, is a shorter (two hours) variant 18xx game set in ancient Greece with shipping lines instead of railroads.[http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/76417/poseidon]
"Steam Over Holland".
Netherlands, designed by Bart van Dijk; publisher Vendetta. Based on "18IR".
"Ur 1830BC".
"Ur 1830BC" is loosely adapted from the 18XX series, and features irrigation and kingdom management in ancient Mesopotamia. It was designed by Jeroen Doumen and Joris Wiersinga and published by Splotter Spellen. As with all games in the 18XX series, play centers around ownership of valuable networks. Ur 1830BC replaces the rail networks found in most 18XX games with networks of irrigation canals, shares with parcels of land, companies with kingdoms, trains with irrigation technologies (such as reservoirs and pumps), and company presidents with kings. While typical 18XX games rail networks generate income through the operation of trains; in Ur 1830BC networks of canals and waterworks generate income by irrigating lands within kingdoms.

Interstellar formaldehyde

Interstellar formaldehyde (a topic relevant to astrochemistry) was first discovered in 1969 by L. Snyder "et al.". using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. Formaldehyde (H2CO) was detected by means of the 111 - 110 ground state rotational transition at 4830 MHz.
Initial discovery.
Formaldehyde was first discovered in interstellar space in 1969 by L. Snyder "et al.". using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. H2CO was detected by means of the 111 - 110 ground state rotational transition at 4830 MHz.
Formaldehyde was the first polyatomic organic molecule detected in the interstellar medium and since its initial detection has been observed in many regions of the galaxy. The isotopic ratio of [12C]/[13C] was determined to be about or less than 50% in the galactic disk. Formaldehyde has been used to map out kinematic features of dark clouds located near Gould's Belt of local bright stars. In 2007, the first H2CO 6 cm maser flare was detected. It was a short duration outburst in IRAS 18566 + 0408 that produced a line profile consistent with the superposition of two Gaussian components, which leads to the belief that an event outside the maser gas triggered simultaneous flares at two different locations. Although this was the first maser flare detected, H2 masers have been observed since 1974 by Downes and Wilson in NGC 7538. Unlike OH, H2O, and CH3OH, only five galactic star forming regions have associated formaldehyde maser emission, which has only been observed through the 110 → 111 transition.
According to Araya "et al."., H2CO are different from other masers in that they are weaker than most other masers (such as OH, CH3OH, and H2O) and have only been detected near very young massive stellar objects. Unlike OH, H2O, and CH3OH, only five galactic star forming regions have associated formaldehyde maser emission, which has only been observed through the 110 → 111 transition. Because of the widespread interest in interstellar formaldehyde it has recently been extensively studied, yielding new extragalactic sources, including NGC 253, NGC 520, NGC 660, NGC 891, NGC 2903, NGC 3079, NGC 3628, NGC 6240, NGC 6946, IC 342, IC 860, Arp 55, Arp 220, M82, M83, IRAS 10173+0828, IRAS 15107+0724, and IRAS 17468+1320.
Interstellar reactions.
The gas-phase reaction that produces formaldehyde possesses modest barriers and is too inefficient to produce the abundance of formaldehyde that has been observed. One proposed mechanism for the formation is the hydrogenation of CO ice, shown below.
This is the basic production mechanism leading to H2CO; there are several side reactions that take place with each step of the reaction that are based on the nature of the ice on the grain according to David Woon. The rate constant presented is for the hydrogenation of CO. The rate constant for the hydrogenation of HCO was not provided as it was much larger than that of the hydrogenation of CO, likely because HCO is a radical. Awad "et al.". mention that this is a surface level reaction only and only the monolayer is considered in calculations; this includes the surface within cracks in the ice.
Formaldehyde is relatively inactive in gas phase chemistry in the interstellar medium. Its action is predominantly focused in grain-surface chemistry on dust grains in interstellar clouds. Reactions involving formaldehyde have been observed to produce molecules containing C-H, C-O, O-H, and C-N bonds. While these products are not necessarily well known, Schutte "et al.". believe these to be typical products of formaldehyde reactions at higher temperatures, polyoxymethylene, methanolamine, methanediol, and methoxyethanol for example (see Table 2). Formaldehyde is believed to be the primary precursor for most of the complex organic material in the interstellar medium, including amino acids. Formaldehyde most often reacts with NH3, H2O, CH3OH, CO, and itself, H2CO. The three dominating reactions are shown below.
There is no kinetic data available for these reactions as the entire reaction is not verified nor well understood. These reactions are believed to take place during warm-up of the ice on grains which releases the molecules to react. These reactions begin at temperatures as low as 40K - 80K but may take place at even lower temperatures.
Note that many other reactions are listed on the UMIST RATE06 database.
Importance of observation.
Formaldehyde appears to be a useful probe for astrochemists due to its low reactivity in the gas phase and to the fact that the 110 - 111 and 211 - 212 K-doublet transitions are rather clear. Formaldehyde has been used in many capacities and to investigate many systems including,
Rotational spectrum.
Above is the rotational spectrum at the ground state vibrational level of H2CO at 30 K. This spectrum was simulated using Pgopher and S-Reduction Rotational constants from Muller "et al.". The observed transitions are the 6.2 cm 111 - 110 and 2.1 cm 212 - 211 K-doublet transitions. At right is the rotational energy level diagram. The ortho/para splitting is determined by the parity of Ka, ortho if Ka is odd and para if Ka is even.

Ralph Bathurst

Ralph Bathurst (1620 – June 14, 1704) was an English theologian and physician.
Early life.
He was born in Hothorpe, Northamptonshire in 1620 and educated at King Henry VIII School, Coventry.
He graduated with a B.A. degree from Trinity College, Oxford in 1638, where he had a family connection with the President, Ralph Kettell (1563–1643).
Oxford science and medicine.
He originally intended a career in the Church of England, and was ordained in 1644, but his prospects were disrupted by the English Civil War, and he turned to medicine. He collaborated with Thomas Willis, and worked on rewriting Willis's major publication "Cerebri Anatomi".
Bathurst was active in the intellectual ferment of the time, and very well connected. In the account given by John Wallis of the precursor groups to the Royal Society of London, Bathurst is mentioned as one of the Oxford experimentalists who gathered from 1648–9. Also in that group were Willis, William Petty and Seth Ward. The group expanded in the 1650s when it gathered around John Wilkins of Wadham College, close however to Oliver Cromwell, and then included also Jonathan Goddard, Thomas Millington, Laurence Rooke, and Christopher Wren. Later Robert Boyle joined.
Bathurst belonged also to the overlapping circle of physicians following the tradition of William Harvey, and which included again Willis, George Ent, Walter Charleton, Nathaniel Highmore, and Charles Scarburgh; these were royalists who had attended Charles I of England. In the celebrated case of Anne Greene, who survived a hanging, the physicians intending to dissect the cadaver were Bathurst, Petty, Willis, and Henry Clerke.
He worked in practical medicine under the physician Daniel Whistler (1619–1684). This was during the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1652 to 1654, when Whistler was in charge of wounded naval personnel. He theorised fruitfully in 1654 on respiration, in a dissertation for his higher medical degree, and his ideas were later taken up, by Boyle and John Mayow.
Later life.
On the English Restoration in 1660 he reverted to a career in the church. There is a story that he had acted as archdeacon and deputy to Robert Skinner, Bishop of Oxford, who was imprisoned by the Parliamentarians. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1663, and was made President of Trinity College in 1664, where he initiated building work to designs by Christopher Wren, a personal friend. He also swayed Samuel Parker from Presbyterian views to an Anglican outlook.
In 1670, he was Dean of Wells Cathedral. For three years from 1673, he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, earning a complimentary reference in a John Dryden poem. John Harris, a Trinity College student in the 1680s, wrote about the intellectual and scientific atmosphere of the college under Bathurst.
A biography was written by Thomas Warton.
Family.
He was one of thirteen sons of George Bathurst. This large royalist family suffered greatly in the Civil War, with six of Ralph Bathurst's brothers being killed.
Theodore Bathurst (died 1651), known as a neo-Latin poet, was a nephew. Another nephew was Ralph Bohun (1639–1716), a poet and experimentalist.

Diazenylium

N2H+, known as diazenylium, was one of the first ions to be observed in interstellar clouds. Since then, it has been observed for a variety of purposes in several different types of interstellar environments. It gives astronomers information about the fractional ionization of gas clouds, the chemistry that happens within those clouds, and it is often used as a tracer for molecules that are not as easily detected (such as N2). Its 1-0 rotational transition occurs at 93.174 GHz, a region of the spectrum where Earth's atmosphere is transparent and it has a significant optical depth in both cold and warm clouds so it is relatively easy to observe with ground-based observatories. The results of N2H+ observations can be used not only for determining the chemistry of interstellar clouds, but also for mapping the density and velocity profiles of these clouds.
Astronomical detections.
N2H+ was first observed in 1974 by B.E. Turner. He observed a previously unidentified triplet at 93.174 GHz using the NRAO 11-meter telescope. Immediately after this initial observation, Green et al. identified the triplet as the 1-0 rotational transition of N2H+. This was done using a combination of ab initio molecular calculations and comparison of similar molecules, such as N2, CO, HCN, HNC, and HCO+, which are all isoelectronic to N2H+. Based on these calculations, the observed rotational transition would be expected to have seven hyperfine components, but only three of these were observed, since the telescope's resolution was insufficient to distinguish the peaks caused by the hyperfine splitting of the inner Nitrogen atom. Just a year later, Thaddeus and Turner observed the same transition in the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC-2) using the same telescope, but this time they integrated for 26 hours, which resulted in a resolution that was good enough to distinguish the smaller hyperfine components.
Over the past three decades, N2H+ has been observed quite frequently, and the 1-0 rotational band is almost exclusively the one that astronomers look for. In 1995, the hyperfine structure of this septuplet was observed with an absolute precision of ~7 kHz, which was good enough to determine its molecular constants with an order of magnitude better precision than was possible in the laboratory. This observation was done toward L1512 using the 37-meter NEROC Haystack Telescope. In the same year, Sage et al. observed the 1-0 transition of N2H+ in seven out of the nine nearby galaxies that they observed with the NRAO 12-meter telescope at Kitt Peak. N2H+ was one of the first few molecular ions to be observed in other galaxies, and its observation helped to show that the chemistry in other galaxies is quite similar to that which we see in our own galaxy. 
N2H+ is most often observed in dense molecular clouds, where it has proven useful as one of the last molecules to freeze out onto dust grains as the density of the cloud increases toward the center. In 2002, Bergin et al. did a spatial survey of dense cores to see just how far toward the center N2H+ could be observed and found that its abundance drops by at least two orders of magnitude when one moves from the outer edge of the core to the center. This showed that even N2H+ is not an ideal tracer for the chemistry of dense pre-stellar cores, and concluded that H2D+ may be the only good molecular probe of the innermost regions of pre-stellar cores.
Laboratory detections.
Although N2H+ is most often observed by astronomers because of its ease of detection, there have been some laboratory experiments that have observed it in a more controlled environment. The first laboratory spectrum of N2H+ was of the 1-0 rotational band in the ground vibrational level, the same microwave transition that astronomers had recently discovered in space. 
Ten years later, Owrutsky et al. performed vibrational spectroscopy of N2H+ by observing the plasma created by a discharge of a mixture nitrogen, hydrogen, and argon gas using a color center laser. During the pulsed discharge, the poles were reversed on alternating pulses, so the ions were pulled back and forth through the discharge cell. This caused the absorption features of the ions, but not the neutral molecules, to be shifted back and forth in frequency space, so a lock-in amplifier could be used to observe the spectra of just the ions in the discharge. The lock-in combined with the velocity modulation gave >99.9% discrimination between ions and neutrals. The feed gas was optimized for N2H+ production, and transitions up to "J"=41 were observed for both the fundamental N-H stretching band and the bending hot band.
Later, Kabbadj et al. observed even more hot bands associated with the fundamental vibrational band using a difference frequency laser to observe a discharge of a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen, and helium gases. They used velocity modulation in the same way that Owrutsky et al. had, in order to discriminate ions from neutrals. They combined this with a counterpropogating beam technique to aid in noise subtraction, and this greatly increased their sensitivity. They had enough sensitivity to observe OH+, H2O+, and H3O+ that were formed from the minute O2 and H2O impurities in their helium tank. 
By fitting all observed bands, the rotational constants for N2H+ were determined to be "B""e" = 1.561928 cm-1 and "D""e" = 2.746x10−6 cm−1, which are the only constants needed to determine the rotational spectrum of this linear molecule in the ground vibrational state (if you ignore hyperfine splitting). The calculated rotational energy levels, along with their percent population at 30 Kelvin, are shown to the right.
Given the selection rule Δ"J" = ±1, the simulated rotational spectrum of N2H+ is shown to the right. The frequencies of the peaks shown differ from those observed in the laboratory by at most 700 kHz.
Chemistry.
N2H+ is found mostly in dense molecular clouds, where its presence is closely related to that of many other nitrogen-containing compounds. It is particularly closely tied to the chemistry of N2, which is more difficult to detect (since it lacks a dipole moment). This is why N2H+ is commonly used to indirectly determine the abundance of N2 in molecular clouds.
The rates of the dominant formation and destruction reactions are shown in the tables to the right. These rates were determined from known rate constants and fractional abundances (relative to H2) in a typical dense molecular cloud. The calculated rates were found at early time (3.16×105 years) and 20 Kelvin, which are typical conditions for a relatively young molecular cloud. 
Of course, there are dozens more reactions, but the above six reactions are the only ones that happen fast enough to affect the abundance of N2H+ in dense molecular clouds. Just looking at these "fast" reactions, it is easy to see that N2H+ is directly tied to the chemistry of many other molecules (N2+, N2, H2, O, CO, OH+, HCO+, and NH). It plays a critical role in the chemistry of Nitrogen-containing molecules, and is also tied to dozens of other molecules through its slower reactions. It is interesting to note that although the electron density in dense clouds is quite low, the destruction of N2H+ is governed mostly by dissociative recombination.

Nicholas Kemeys

Sir Nicholas Kemeys, 1st Baronet (before 1593 – 25 May 1648) was a Welsh landowner and soldier during the English Civil War in South Wales and played a key part in events in the region during that conflict.
Lineage.
The family claimed descent from a Stephen de Kemeys who held lands in the southern Welsh Marches, in Monmouthshire in the 1230s. A David Kemeys, the son of Ievan Kemeys of Began (near St Mellons) married Cecil, a daughter of Llewelyn ab Evan ab Llewelyn ap Cynfig of Cefn Mably in or around 1450.
David was succeeded by his son, Lewis Kemeys and his son and heir in turn was John Kemeys, succeeded by his son, also named David (possibly born 1564). David's eldest son Edward Kemeys, High Sheriff of Glamorganshire for 1574, died without issue and the estate passed to a nephew, another David Kemeys, the son of Rhys Kemeys of Llanvair Castle (Llanvair Discoed), who also became Sheriff of Glamorgan for 1616. He was succeeded by his son Edward who had no issue and the estate therefore passed to Nicholas Kemeys, the second son of Rhys Kemeys.
Biography.
Nicholas Kemeys was MP for Monmouthshire 1628 to 1629 and High Sheriff of Monmouthshire for 1631 and Sheriff of Glamorganshire for 1638. At the outbreak of the English Civil War he was created a Baronet by King Charles I of England.
He was a passionate supporter of the King and monarchy and as Custos Rotulorum of Monmouthshire played a leading and high profile part in Monmouthshire during the Civil War. He was appointed Governor of Cardiff castle. As an ally of Sir Trevor Williams, 1st Baronet of Llangibby, Sir Nicholas led the defence of Chepstow Castle and was killed there in combat on 25 May 1648 after refusing to surrender after the Castle's fall. The location, within the castle, is marked by a plaque erected by members of the Kemeys family in 1935.
He had married Jane, daughter of Sir Rowland Williams, Kt, of Llangibby Castle and left a son and heir, Sir Charles Kemeys, 2nd Baronet who also played an active role during the remainder of the war.

Inflection

In grammar, inflection or inflexion is the modification of a word to express different grammatical categories such as tense, mood, voice, aspect, person, number, gender and case. The inflection of verbs is also called "conjugation", and the inflection of nouns, adjectives and pronouns is also called "declension".
An inflection expresses one or more grammatical categories with a prefix, suffix or infix, or another internal modification such as a vowel change. For example, the Latin verb "ducam", meaning "I will lead", includes the suffix "-am", expressing person (first), number (singular), and tense (future). The use of this suffix is an inflection. In contrast, in the English clause "I will lead", the word "lead" is not inflected for any of person, number, or tense; it is simply the bare form of a verb.
The inflected form of a word often contains both a free morpheme (a unit of meaning which can stand by itself as a word), and a bound morpheme (a unit of meaning which cannot stand alone as a word). For example, the English word "cars" is a noun that is inflected for number, specifically to express the plural; the content morpheme "car" is unbound because it could stand alone as a word, while the suffix "-s" is bound because it cannot stand alone as a word. These two morphemes together form the inflected word "cars".
Words that are never subject to inflection are said to be invariant; for example, the English verb "must" is an invariant item: it never takes a suffix or changes form to signify a different grammatical category. Its categories can be determined only from its context.
Requiring the inflections of more than one word in a sentence to be compatible according to the rules of the language is known as concord or agreement. For example, in "the choir sings", "choir" is a singular noun, so "sing" is constrained in the present tense to use the third person singular suffix "s".
Languages that have some degree of inflection are synthetic languages. These can be highly inflected, such as Latin, or weakly inflected, such as English. Languages that are so inflected that a sentence can consist of a single highly inflected word (such as many American Indian languages) are called polysynthetic languages. Languages in which each inflection conveys only a single grammatical category, such as Finnish, are known as agglutinative languages, while languages in which a single inflection can convey multiple grammatical roles (such as both nominative case and plural, as in Latin and German) are called fusional. Languages such as Mandarin Chinese that never use inflections are called analytic or isolating.
Examples in English.
In English most nouns are inflected for number with the inflectional plural affix "-s" (as in "dog" → "dog-s"), and most English verbs are inflected for tense with the inflectional past tense affix "-ed" (as in "call" → "call-ed"). English also inflects verbs by affixation to mark the third person singular in the present tense (with "-s"), and the present participle (with "-ing"). English short adjectives are inflected to mark comparative and superlative forms (with "-er" and "-est" respectively). In addition, English also shows inflection by ablaut (sound change, mostly in verbs) and umlaut (a particular type of sound change, mostly in nouns), as well as long-short vowel alternation. For example:
For details, see English plural, English verbs, and English irregular verbs.
Regular and irregular inflection.
When a given word class is subject to inflection in a particular language, there are generally one or more standard patterns of inflection (the "paradigms" described below) that words in that class may follow. Words which follow such a standard pattern are said to be regular; those that inflect differently are called irregular.
For instance, many languages that feature verb inflection have both regular verbs and irregular verbs. In English, regular verbs form their past tense and past participle with the ending "-d"; thus verbs like "play", "arrive" and "enter" are regular. However, there are a few hundred verbs which follow different patterns, such as "sing–sang–sung" and "keep–kept–kept"; these are described as irregular. Irregular verbs often preserve patterns which were regular in past forms of the language, but which have now become anomalous. (For more details see English verbs and English irregular verbs.)
Other types of irregular inflected form include irregular plurals, such as the English "mice", "children" and "women" (see English plural) and the French "yeux" (the plural of "œil", "eye"); and irregular comparative and superlative forms of adjectives or adverbs, such as the English "better" and "best" (which correspond to the positive form "good" or "well").
For more details on some of the considerations that apply to regularly and irregularly inflected forms, see the article on regular and irregular verbs.
Declension and conjugation.
Two traditional grammatical terms refer to inflections of specific word classes:
An organized list of the inflected forms of a given lexeme is also called its "declension", or "conjugation", as the case may be.
Below is the declension of the English pronoun "I", which is inflected for case and number.
The pronoun "who" is also inflected in formal English according to case. Its declension is defective, in the sense that it lacks a reflexive form.
The following table shows the conjugation of the verb "to arrive" in the indicative mood. It is inflected for person, number, and tense by suffixation.
The non-finite forms "arrive" (bare infinitive), "arrived" (past participle) and "arriving" (gerund/present participle), although not inflected for person or number, can also be regarded as part of the conjugation of the verb "to arrive". Compound verb forms such as "I have arrived", "I had arrived", or "I will arrive" can be included also in the conjugation of this verb for didactical purposes, but are not overt conjugations of "arrive". The formula for deriving the covert form, in which the relevant inflections do not occur in the main verb, is
Inflectional paradigm.
A class of words with similar inflection rules is called an inflectional paradigm. Typically the similar rules amount to a unique set of affixes. Nominal inflectional paradigms are also called "declensions", and verbal inflectional paradigms are also called "conjugations". For example, in Old English nouns could be divided into two major declensions, the strong and the weak, inflected as is shown below:
The terms "strong declension" and "weak declension" are primarily relevant to well-known dependent-marking languages (such as the Indo-European languages, or Japanese). In dependent-marking languages, nouns in adpositional phrases can carry inflectional morphemes. (Adpositions include prepositions and postpositions.) In head-marking languages, the adpositions can carry the inflection in adpositional phrases. This means that these languages will have inflected adpositions. In Western Apache (San Carlos dialect), the postposition "-ká’" 'on' is inflected for person and number with prefixes.
Traditional grammars have specific terms for inflections of nouns and verbs, but not for those of adpositions.
Inflection vs. derivation.
Inflection is the process of adding "inflectional morphemes" (smallest units of meaning) to a word, which indicate grammatical information (for example, case, number, person, gender or voice, mood, tense, or aspect). Derivation is the process of adding "derivational morphemes", which create a new word from existing words, sometimes by simply changing grammatical category (for example, changing a noun to a 
Words generally are not listed in dictionaries (in which case they would be lexical items) on the basis of their inflectional morphemes. But they often are listed on the basis of their derivational morphemes. For instance, English dictionaries list "readable" and "readability", words with derivational suffixes, along with their root "read". However, no traditional English dictionary lists "book" as one entry and "books" as a separate entry nor do they list "jump" and "jumped" as two different entries.
Inflectional morphology.
Languages that add inflectional morphemes to words are sometimes called "inflectional languages", which is a synonym for "inflected languages". Morphemes may be added in several different ways:
Affixing includes prefixing (adding before the base), and suffixing (adding after the base), as well as the much less common infixing (inside) and circumfixing (a combination of prefix and suffix).
Inflection is most typically realized by adding an inflectional morpheme (that is, affixation) to the base form (either the root or a stem).
Inflection in various languages.
Indo-European languages (fusional).
All Indo-European languages, such as Albanian, English, German, Russian, Persian, Kurdish, Italian, Irish, Spanish, French, Sanskrit, Marathi, Urdu, Bengali and Hindi are inflected to a greater or lesser extent. In general, older Indo-European languages such as Latin, Greek, Old English, Old Norse, and Sanskrit are extensively inflected. Deflexion has caused modern versions of some languages that were previously highly inflected to be much less so; an excellent example is Modern English, as compared to Old English. Most Slavic languages are an exception to the general Indo-European deflexion trend, continuing to be highly inflected (in some cases acquiring additional inflectional complexity and grammatical genders, as in Czech).
English.
Old English was a moderately inflected language, using an extensive case system similar to that of modern Icelandic or German. Middle and Modern English lost progressively more of the Old English inflectional system. Modern English is considered a weakly inflected language, since its nouns have only vestiges of inflection (plurals, the pronouns), and its regular verbs have only four forms: an inflected form for the past indicative and subjunctive ("looked"), an inflected form for the third-person-singular present indicative ("looks"), an inflected form for the present participle ("looking"), and an uninflected form for everything else ("look"). While the English possessive indicator "'s" (as in "Jane's book") is a remnant of the Old English genitive case suffix, it is now considered not a suffix but a clitic.
Other Germanic languages.
Old Norse was inflected, but modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish have, like English, lost almost all overt inflection. Icelandic preserves almost all of the inflections of Old Norse and has added its own. Modern German remains moderately inflected, retaining four noun cases, although the genitive started falling into disuse in all but formal writing in Early New High German. The case system of Dutch, simpler than that of German, is also simplified in common usage. Afrikaans, recognized as a distinct language in its own right rather than a Dutch dialect only in the early 20th century, has lost almost all inflection.
Latin and the Romance languages.
The Romance languages, such as Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese and Romanian, have more overt inflection than English, especially in verb conjugation. Adjectives, nouns and articles are considerably less inflected than verbs, but they still have different forms according to number and grammatical gender.
Latin, the mother tongue of the Romance languages, was highly inflected; nouns and adjectives had different forms according to seven grammatical cases (including five major ones) with five major patterns of declension, and three genders instead of the two found in most Romance tongues. There were four patterns of conjugation in six tenses, three moods (indicative, subjunctive, imperative, plus the infinitive, participle, gerund, gerundive, and supine) and two voices (passive and active), all overtly expressed by affixes (passive voice forms were periphrastic in three tenses).
Baltic languages.
The Baltic languages are highly inflected. Nouns and adjectives are declined in up to seven overt cases. Additional cases are defined in various covert ways. For example, an inessive case, an illative case, an adessive case and allative case are borrowed from Finnic. Latvian has only one overt locative case but it syncretizes the above four cases to the locative marking them by differences in the use of prepositions. Lithuanian breaks them out of the genitive case, accusative case and locative case by using different postpositions.
Modern Baltic languages have also retained the old dual number. However, it is nowadays considered obsolete. For instance, in standard Lithuanian it is normal to say "dvi varnos (plural) – two crows" instead of "dvi varni (dual)". Adjectives, pronouns, and numerals are declined for number, gender, and case to agree with the noun they modify or for which they substitute. Baltic verbs are inflected for tense, mood, aspect, and voice. They agree with the subject in person and number (not in all forms in modern Latvian).
Slavic languages.
All Slavic languages make use of a high degree of inflection, typically having six or seven cases and three genders for nouns and adjectives. However, the overt case system has disappeared almost completely in modern Bulgarian and Macedonian. Most verb tenses and moods are also formed by inflection (however, some are periphrastic, typically future and conditional). Inflection is also present in adjective comparation and word derivation.
Declensional endings depend on case (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, instrumental, vocative), number (singular, dual or plural), gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and animacy (animate vs inanimate). Unusual in other language families, declension in most Slavic languages also depends on whether the word is a noun or an adjective. Slovene and Sorbian languages use a rare third number, (in addition to singular and plural numbers) known as dual (in case of some words dual survived also in Polish and other Slavic languages). Modern Russian and Czech also use a more complex form of dual, but this misnomer applies instead to numbers 2, 3, 4, and larger numbers ending in 2, 3, or 4 (with the exception of the teens, which are handled as plural; thus, 102 is dual, but 12 or 127 are not).
In addition, in some Slavic languages, such as Polish, word stems are frequently modified by the addition or absence of endings, resulting in consonant and vowel alternation.
Arabic (fusional).
Modern Standard Arabic (also called Literary Arabic) is an inflected language. It uses a system of independent and suffix pronouns classified by person and number and verbal inflections marking person and number. Suffix pronouns are used as markers of possession and as objects of verbs and prepositions. The tatweel (ـــ) marks where the verb stem, verb form, noun, or preposition is placed.
Arabic regional dialects (e.g. Moroccan Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, Gulf Arabic), used for everyday communication, tend to have less inflection than the more formal Literary Arabic. For example, in Jordanian Arabic, the second- and third-person feminine plurals ( and ) and their respective unique conjugations are lost and replaced by the masculine ( and ), whereas in Lebanese and Syrian Arabic, is replaced by .
In addition, the system known as ʾIʿrāb places vowel suffixes on each verb, noun, adjective, and adverb, according to its function within a sentence and its relation to surrounding words.
Uralic languages (agglutinative).
The Uralic languages are agglutinative, following from the agglutination in Proto-Uralic. The largest languages are Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian—all European Union official languages. Uralic inflection is, or is developed from, affixing. Grammatical markers directly added to the word perform the same function as prepositions in English. Almost all words are inflected according to their roles in the sentence: verbs, nouns, pronouns, numerals, adjectives, and some particles.
Hungarian and Finnish, in particular, often simply concatenate suffixes. For example, Finnish "talossanikinko" "in my house, too?" consists of "talo-ssa-ni-kin-ko". However, in the Finnic languages (Finnish, Estonian, Sami), there are processes which affect the root, particularly consonant gradation. The original suffixes may disappear (and appear only by liaison), leaving behind the modification of the root. This process is extensively developed in Estonian and Sami, and makes them also inflected, not only agglutinating languages. The Estonian illative case, for example, is expressed by a modified root: "maja" →"majja" (historical form *"majam").
Altaic languages (agglutinative).
The three language families often united as Altaic languages—Turkic, Mongolic, and Manchu-Tungus—are agglutinative. The largest languages are Turkish, Azerbaijani and Uzbek—all Turkic languages. Altaic inflection is, or is developed from, affixing. Grammatical markers directly added to the word perform the same function as prepositions in English. Almost all words are inflected according to their roles in the sentence: verbs, nouns, pronouns, numerals, adjectives, and some particles.
Basque (agglutinative nominal inflection / fusional verb inflection).
Basque, a language isolate, is a highly inflected language, heavily inflecting both nouns and verbs.
Noun phrase morphology is agglutinative and consists of suffixes which simply attach to the end of a stem. These suffixes are in many cases fused with the article ("-a" for singular and "-ak" for plural), which in general is required to close a noun phrase in Basque if no other determiner is present, and unlike an article in many languages, it can only partially be correlated with the concept of definiteness. Proper nouns do not take an article, and indefinite nouns without the article (called "mugagabe" in Basque grammar) are highly restricted syntactically. Basque is an ergative language, meaning that inflectionally the single argument (subject) of an intransitive verb is marked in the same way as the direct object of a transitive verb. This is called the "absolutive" case and in Basque, as in most ergative languages, it is realized with a zero morph; in other words, it receives no special inflection. The subject of a transitive verb receives a special case suffix, called the "ergative" case.
There is no case marking concord in Basque and case suffixes, including those fused with the article, are added only to the last word in a noun phrase. Plurality is not marked on the noun and is identified only in the article or other determiner, possibly fused with a case marker. The examples below are in the absolutive case with zero case marking, and include the article only:
The noun phrase is declined for 11 cases: "Absolutive, ergative, dative, possessive-genitive, benefactive, comitative, instrumental, inessive, allative, ablative," and "local-genitive". These are signaled by suffixes that vary according to the categories of "Singular, Plural, Indefinite," and "Proper Noun", and many vary depending on whether the stem ends in a consonant or vowel. The Singular and Plural categories are fused with the article, and these endings are used when the noun phrase is not closed by any other determiner. This gives a potential 88 different forms, but the Indefinite and Proper Noun categories are identical in all but the local cases (inessive, allative, ablative, local-genitive), and many other variations in the endings can be accounted for by phonological rules operating to avoid impermissible consonant clusters. Local case endings are not normally added to animate Proper Nouns. The precise meaning of the local cases can be further specified by additional suffixes added after the local case suffixes.
Verb forms are extremely complex, agreeing with the subject, direct object, and indirect object; and include forms that agree with a "dative of interest" for intransitive verbs as well as allocutive forms where the verb form is altered if one is speaking to a close acquaintance. These allocutive forms also have different forms depending on whether the addressee is male or female. This is the only area in Basque grammar where gender plays any role at all. Subordination could also plausibly be considered an inflectional category of the Basque verb since subordination is signaled by prefixes and suffixes on the conjugated verb, further multiplying the number of potential forms.
Transitivity is a thoroughgoing division of Basque verbs, and it is necessary to know the transitivity of a particular verb in order to conjugate it successfully. In the spoken language only a handful of commonly used verbs are fully conjugated in the present and simple past, most verbs being conjugated by means of an auxiliary which differs according to transitivity. The literary language includes a few more such verbs, but the number is still very small. Even these few verbs require an auxiliary to conjugate other tenses besides the present and simple past.
The most common intransitive auxiliary is "izan", which is also the verb for "to be". The most common transitive auxiliary is "ukan", which is also the verb for "to have". (Other auxiliaries can be used in some of the tenses and may vary by dialect.) The compound tenses use an invariable form of the main verb (which appears in different forms according to the "tense group") and a conjugated form of the auxiliary. Pronouns are normally omitted if recoverable from the verb form. A couple of examples will have to suffice to demonstrate the complexity of the Basque verb:
Liburu-"ak" saldu "dizkiegu".
Book-"plural.the" sell Auxiliary."3rd/Pl/Absolutive.3rd/Pl/Dative.1st/Pl/Ergative"
"We sold the books to them."
Kafe-"a" gusta-"tzen zaidak".
Coffee-"the" please-"Habitual" Auxiliary."Allocutive/Male.3rd/Sng/Absolutive.1st/Sng/Dative"
"I like coffee." ("Coffee pleases me.") "(Used when speaking to a male friend.)"
The morphs that represent the various tense/person/case/mood categories of Basque verbs, especially in the auxiliaries, are so highly fused that segmenting them into individual meaningful units is nearly impossible, if not pointless. Considering the multitude of forms that a particular Basque verb can take, it seems unlikely that an individual speaker would have an opportunity to utter them all in his or her lifetime.
Sino-Tibetan languages (isolating).
Some of the major Eastern Asian languages (such as the various Chinese languages, Vietnamese, and Thai) are not overtly inflected, or show very little overt inflection, so they are considered analytic languages (also known as "isolating languages").
Chinese.
The Chinese family of languages, in general, does not possess overt inflectional morphology. Chinese words generally comprise one or two monosyllabic written characters, each of which can also stand alone as an unbound morpheme. Since morphemes are monosyllabic in the Chinese languages, Chinese is quite resistant to inflectional changes; instead, Chinese uses lexical means for achieving covert inflectional transparency.
While European languages more often use overt inflection to mark a word's function in a sentence, the Chinese languages tend to use word order as a grammatical marking system. Whereas in English the first-person singular nominative "I" changes to "me" when used in the accusative – that is, as the object of a verb – Chinese simply uses word order to mark such a distinction. An example from Mandarin: 我给了他一本书 ("wǒ gěile tā yī běn shū") 'I gave him a book'. Here 我 ("wǒ") means 'I' and 他 ("tā") means 'him'. However, 'He gave me a book' would be: 他给了我一本书 ("tā gěile wǒ yī běn shū"). 我 ("Wǒ") and 他 ("Tā") simply change places in the sentence to indicate that their case has switched: there is no overt inflection in the form of the words. In classical Chinese, pronouns were overtly inflected as to case. However, these overt case forms are no longer used; most of the alternative pronouns are considered archaic in modern Mandarin Chinese. Classically, 我 ("wǒ") was used solely as the first person accusative. 吾 ("Wú") was generally used as the first person nominative. Examples of inflection can still be found in some of the Chinese languages: in Hakka, the possessive adjectives are formed by inflection (unlike in Mandarin where they are formed by adding the particle 的 after the personal pronoun). In Shanghainese, the third-person singular pronoun is overtly inflected as to case and the first- and second-person singular pronouns exhibit a change in tone depending on case.
Japanese (isolating/agglutinative).
Japanese shows a high degree of overt inflection of verbs, less so of adjectives, and very little of nouns, but it is mostly strictly agglutinative and extremely regular. Some fusion of morphemes does take place (e.g. causative-passive され "-sare-" as in　行かせられる "ikaserareru" "is made to go", and non-past progressive ている "-teiru-" as in 　食べている "tabeteiru" "is eating"). Formally, every noun phrase must be marked for case, but this is done by invariable particles (clitic postpositions). (Many grammarians consider Japanese particles to be separate words, and therefore not an inflection, while others consider agglutination a type of overt inflection, and therefore consider Japanese nouns as overtly inflected.)
Auxiliary languages.
Auxiliary languages, such as Esperanto, Ido, and Interlingua have comparatively simple inflectional systems.
Esperanto.
In Esperanto, an agglutinative language, nouns and adjectives are inflected for case (nominative, accusative) and number (singular, plural), according to a simple paradigm without irregularities. Verbs are not inflected for person or number, but they are inflected for tense (past, present, future) and mood (indicative, infinitive, conditional, jussive). They also form active and passive participles, which may be past, present or future. All verbs are regular.
Ido.
Ido has a different form for each verbal tense (past, present, future, volitive and imperative) plus an infinitive, and both a present and past participle. There are though no verbal inflections for person or number, and all verbs are regular.
Nouns are marked for number (singular and plural), and the accusative case may be shown in certain situations, typically when the direct object of a sentence precedes its verb. On the other hand, adjectives are unmarked for gender, number or case (unless they stand on their own, without a noun, in which case they take on the same desinences as the missing noun would have taken). The definite article "la" ("the") remains unaltered regardless of gender or case, and also of number, except when there is no other word to show plurality. Pronouns are identical in all cases, though exceptionally the accusative case may be marked, as for nouns.
Interlingua.
Interlingua, in contrast with the Romance languages, has no irregular verb conjugations, and its verb forms are the same for all persons and numbers. It does, however, have compound verb tenses similar to those in the Romance, Germanic, and Slavic languages: "ille ha vivite", "he has lived"; "illa habeva vivite", "she had lived". Nouns are inflected by number, taking a plural "-s", but rarely by gender: only when referring to a male or female being. Interlingua has no noun-adjective agreement by gender, number, or case. As a result, adjectives ordinarily have no inflections. They may take the plural form if they are being used in place of a noun: "le povres", "the poor".

Ōe Taku

Biography.
Ōe was born in Hata District, Tosa Domain, what is now Ōtsuki, Kōchi. He grew up in Nagasaki, but towards the end of the Bakumatsu period returned to his native Tosa to join the "Rikuentai", a paramilitary group of Tosa "samurai" supporting the "Sonnō jōi" movement and dedicated to the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate. His fellow members included Sakamoto Ryōma, Nakaoka Shintarō and Mutsu Munemitsu. In 1868, he participated in an attack against the foreign consulates in Kobe.
After the Meiji Restoration, Ōe left Tosa for Tokyo in 1871 and joined the new Meiji government. Somewhat ironically for his xenophobic background, he was assigned as a judge to assist Mutsu Munemitsu (who had been appointed governor of Kanagawa Prefecture) in the management of foreign affairs at the port of Yokohama. Ōe played a central role in the María Luz Incident, in which the Japanese government took steps to rescue 232 Chinese indentured laborers from a Peruvian ship, over the vehement protests by the Western nations. The incident also led to legislation in 1872, emancipating "burakumin" outcasts, prostitutes and other forms of bonded labor in Japan.
In 1877, Ōe returned to Tosa, in an attempt to encourage his countrymen to rise up against the central government in support of the Satsuma Rebellion. After the failure of the rebellion, he was arrested for treason, and sentenced to twelve years in prison.
Ōe returned to Tokyo in 1890, having been elected a member of the lower house in the Diet of Japan in the 1890 General Election as one of the founding members of the Liberal Party. He spoke out strongly against increasing government corruption, and the ever increasing military expenditures. He left the government in 1892 to become President of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In 1899, he became one of the founders of the Keifu Railway Company, which aimed at establishing a railway connecting the Korean capital of Seoul with the southern port city of Pusan.
However, in 1914, Ōe retired from all business and political activities, took the tonsure and became a Buddhist priest of the Sōtō Zen sect, and traveled around the country. In his final years, he became an outspoken proponent of ending all discrimination with regards to the "burakumin" outcasts. He died of stomach cancer in 1921, and his grave it was the Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

The Palawan Birdwing or Triangle Birdwing ("Trogonoptera trojana") is a birdwing butterfly of the family Papilionidae. It is endemic to Palawan in the Philippines. It is one of only two species in its genus, the other being the more widespread Rajah Brooke's Birdwing, but (among others) the male Palawan Birdwing has narrower green bands on the rearwings. 
This species is included in CITES Appendix II, restricting international export to those who have been granted a permit. The wingspan is approximately . The species may be observed flying at any point during the year. The larvae feed on "Aristolochia".

Cardboard modeling

Cardboard modeling is a form of modelling with paper, card stock, paperboard, and corrugated fiberboard. The term "cardboard engineering" is sometimes used to differentiate from craft of making decorative cards. It is often referred to as "paper modelling" although in practice card is generally used.
History.
Originally this was a form of modelling undertaken because of the low cost involved. Card, a means of cutting and glue are all that is needed. Some models are 100% card, while others use items of other materials to reinforce the model. After World War II cardboard models were promoted by a number of model companies. One company, ERG (Bournemouth) Ltd. produced a book - 
Books of printed models to cut out and make have been around a long time. Also special printed cards were available from which models could be made. In the UK Micromodels were well known for very small card models.
Models to cut out were also a feature of paperboard folding cartons. For many years Weetabix had models to cut out on their breakfast cereal packets.
The hobby has been revived through the use of IT based printers, especially the ink-jet and laser colour printers. Using a vector graphics package it is possible anyone to create their own models from scratch.
Pre-printed models may be downloaded from the internet. A web ring lists some of these while others offer a range of models from the simple to the complex.

Francesco I Crispo

Francesco I Crispo, Patrizio Veneto (died 1397) was the tenth Duke of the Archipelago through his marriage and the will of Venice.
Francesco Crispo was probably born in Verona. He was Lord of Milos, thus vassal of the Duke of Naxos. He was also his cousin because he was married with a grand daughter of the Duke Guglielmo Sanudo, Fiorenza I Sanudo, Lady of Milos. He might also have been a pirat. He was sent by the Republic of Venice to Naxos in March 1383. The then Duke Niccolo III dalle Carceri was deemed incompetent by Venice. The Republic was suffering from the Ottoman conquest of the Aegean. Francesco Crispo was sent to help his cousin and lord.
On the island, a hunt was suggested. Officially, on the way back Niccolo III, escorted by Crispo's men was attacked by rebels or thieves. He fell off his horse and died. To quench any revolt, Francesco Crispo had to assume power.
The Republic of Venice quickly sent its congratulations.
Andros was another problem. It belonged to Maria Sanuda, sister of the late duke. When Francesco gave as a dowry Andros and Syros to his own daughter Pétronilla, Maria Sanuda called for justice in Venice.
With his wife he had eight children:

Tambacan, Iligan

Tambacan is one of the 44 barangays of Iligan, a city about southeast of Manila in the Philippines. It is south of Iligan's central business district, Barangay Poblacion. Tambacan is bounded by Barangay Poblacion and Tubod River on the north, Iligan Bay on the west, Barangay Mahayahay and Tubod River on the east and Barangay Tubod on the south and southwest. 
Barangay Tambacan was created on September 5, 1966 by virtue of Resolution 232 series of 1966 which eventually approved as City Ordinance 280. It has a total land area of about and is subdivided into 12 puroks.
As of Aug 1, 2007, Barangay Tambacan has a population of 13,906.
Accessible from the north through Barangay Poblacion by the Tambacan Bridge and from the south through Tubod by the Tambacan Highway, Barangay Tambacan is becoming a major bypass route from Iligan's main thoroughfares. Fishing is the source of occupation for most residents not only due to its proximity to the Iligan Bay but also because Iligan's major dropping point for fish trades from the major fish ports in Mindanao is located in one of its puroks which is Iligan-LGU's fish dropping facility called locally as "Bagsakan". The proximity of the fish marketplace is an advantage for traders residing at the barangay to Iligan's two major marketplaces which are the Pala-o Supermaket and Iligan's Wet Market, formerly the Old Public Market. 
Tambacan has two schools: Tambacan Elementary School for grades one through six and the Iligan City National High School (ICNHS) Tambacan Campus, also known as the ICNHS Annex (Tambacan), which also serves the southern barangays of Iligan.
The barangay is in a low-lying area, and has been affected by flooding in recent years.
Barangay Captains of Barangay Tambacan.
Barrio Tambacan: Before 1966 
Barangay Tambacan was founded as a barangay on September 5, 1966 by virtue of Resolution No. 202 which became City Ordinance 280, the previous leaders of the barangay, which may be called " barangay chairman" in some areas of the country, are called "tinyente del barrio", which is Spanish term for "lieutenant of the barrio"; also by how it is meant, connoted a person as a leader of a local barrio who were non-elected officials of the time as Tambacan did not yet have the capacity to choose a leader that it may legally called a voted leader. And so these leaders who became "tinyente del barrio" were appointed individuals which is close to how we choose our very "purok" leaders or presidents we have today. As a good precursor of chornological history of people who became barangay captain of Tambacan, a personal research was done to aid in gathering the utmost data for this. Mr. Chokong Viajante was asked by Mrs. Josephine Jariol who happens to know the bona fide Tambacanons who know the history of the barangay. According to the list provided by Mr. Chokong Viajante, the "tinyente del barrios" of Barangay Tambacan were Vidal Orellana, Mr. Teofilo Madolin Demetrio Cabante, Felicidad Ybañez, and, the husband of Felicidad Ybañez, Mr. Deogracia Ybañez.
Barangay Tambacan: 1966 Onwards 
Consequently, As narrated by Mr. Chokong Viajante that when Tambacan was founded as a barangay of Iligan City in 1966 by virute of C.O. 280; William "Bill" Wright Jr. became the first person to be elected as barangay captain of Tambacan. This was also supported by Mr. Angelito "Tidong" Gaboy that William "Bill" Wright Jr. served as barangay captain from 1966 to 1978 which consisted of 12 years of service to the people of Tambacan if not only for his untimely death. After Mr. Wright, the next successor was the first councilor during his last term who was Danilo Navalta. But then, Mr. Navalta also met his untimely death, the next successor who was the second councilor during William Wright's term, Minda Actub, filled in the position as barangay captain of Tambacan until Marcos' regime ended in 1986.
1986 to Present
Mr. Chokong Viajante stated that when Corazon Aquino became president after the EDSA People Power revolution, Mr. Candelario Lluisma became the chairman to lead Barangay Tambacan by virtue of becoming the winner among top 10 voted candidates for the council of Tambacan. The chairmanship served as the transitional position because of the reorganization that took place during that time as there was also the re-drafting of the Philippine constitution which promulgated the 1987 New Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines the following year. After Mr. Lluisma, it was Mr. Abutanmo's turn to take the lead in the barangay sometime in 1990. After Mr. Abutanmo's turn, again, Mr. Candelario Lluisma became the captain until 1998. From 1998 to present, it was Mr. Celso Ponce who led the council of barangay Tambacan.

List of Knight's Cross recipients 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf

The SS Division "Totenkopf" ("Death's Head" or "Skull") is also known as 3. SS-Panzergrenadier-Division "Totenkopf" and 3. SS-Panzer-Division "Totenkopf". It was one of the 38 divisions fielded by the Waffen-SS during World War II. Prior to achieving division status, the formation was known as Kampfgruppe "Eicke". The division is infamous due to its insignia and the fact that most of the initial enlisted men were SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS concentration camp guards).
The "Totenkopf" division was numbered with the "Germanic" divisions of the Waffen-SS. These included also the SS-Panzergrenadier-Division "Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler", SS-Panzergrenadier-Division "Das Reich", and SS-Panzergrenadier-Division "Wiking".
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573" of September 1, 1939 instituted the Iron Cross and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. As the war progressed some of the recipients distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849" of June 3, 1940. In 1941 two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613" of September 28, 1941 introduced the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the last and final grade, the Knight's Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, based on the enactment "Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11" of December 29, 1944 concluded the variants of the Knight's Cross.
Prerequisites.
To qualify for the Knight's Cross, a soldier had to already hold the 1939 Iron Cross First Class, though the Iron Cross I Class was awarded concurrently with the Knight's Cross in rare cases.
Unit commanders could also be awarded the medal for exemplary conduct by the unit as a whole.
Grades.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was divided into five grades, excluding the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross:

Brian Bogusevic

Brian Bogusevic (Serbian Latin: Brian Bogušević; born February 18, 1984) is a professional baseball outfielder for the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.
College career.
Bogusevic was a two-way star player for Tulane University, playing in the outfield and also used as a starting pitcher. He was also a two-way player in high school, a three-year letterman at De La Salle Institute for coach Brad Esposito pitching and playing outfield. While playing for the Green Wave, he was named to the All-Tournament Team in the 2005 Conference USA Tournament. 
Houston Astros.
He was drafted 24th overall in the 2005 MLB Draft by the Houston Astros as a starting pitcher. He remained a pitcher in the Houston Astros organization until mid- before converting to an outfielder. In 2008, he was selected to play in the Arizona Fall League as an outfielder. 
On August 16, 2011, he became the 26th player in Major League History to hit an "ultimate grand slam," a pinch-hit walk-off home run which won the game by one run.
Bogusevic reprised his old pitching role for one game in 2012, a June 7 relief appearance against the St. Louis Cardinals. Entering a 12–2 blowout, Bogusevic pitched the 9th inning and surrendered two runs. He featured a 90 mph fastball.
On November 3, Bogusevic elected to become a free agent after being outrighted off the 40-man roster. 
Chicago Cubs.
On November 21, 2012, Bogusevic signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs. He was cut from spring training on March 22, 2013, who was hitting .410. The fifth outfielder ended up being Dave Sappelt, who won the job because of his platooning ability. He was Iowa's Opening Day first baseman, where he went 3-5 with an RBI and a run in his debut. Through April, he was hitting .420 with 10 RBI and 16 runs. Through May he was hitting .367 with 5 HR, 20 RBI and 32 runs. On June 25, Bogusevic was called up by Chicago.

When Ryan Sweeney went on the disabled list with fracture ribs, Bogusevic took over in center field. However, on July 14, Bogusevic suffered an injury of his own, and was replaced by Junior Lake. After rehabbing in Arizona, Bogusevic returned on August 19, replacing the recently traded David DeJesus. Bogusevic was splitting time with Darnell McDonald in left field with Lake in center field, but when Sweeney returned on September 1, he pushed Lake to left field, and Lake and Bogusevic split time there. In 47 games with Chicago, Bogusevic hit .273 with 6 HR, 16 RBI and 18 runs.
Miami Marlins.
On December 12, 2013, the Cubs traded Bogusevic to the Miami Marlins for outfielder Justin Ruggiano.

Frederick Knefler

Frederick Knefler (April 12, 1824-June 14, 1901) served in the Union Army in the U.S. Civil War, joining as a first lieutenant in May 1861 and mustering out as a Brevet Brigadier General on June 11, 1865.
Early life.
Frederick Knefler (Knoepfler Frigyes) was born in Arad, Hungary, son of Nathan Knoepfler, a Hungarian Jew and a physician. He enlisted with his father in the revolutionary forces during the 1848-49 Hungarian War of Liberation. After the revolutionary forces were defeated, the entire Knoepfler family fled to the United States, first to New York, then to Indianapolis, Indiana. As one of the earliest Jewish families settling in Indianapolis, Dr. Knoepfler was one of the original founders of the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation.
Knefler trained as a carpenter in New York, a trade he continued in Indianapolis as he studied law. He became assistant to the clerk of Marion County, Indiana, in which position he became acquainted with Lew Wallace.
Civil War service.
11th Indiana Infantry.
Upon President Lincoln’s proclamation calling for the raising of 75,000 troops after the firing on Fort Sumter, Governor Oliver Morton appointed Lew Wallace Adjutant-General with the task of raising Indiana’s quota. Wallace, in turn, appointed Knefler as his principal assistant. After raising five regiments, Wallace requested and received command of the 11th Indiana Infantry, commissioning Knefler as a first lieutenant in it; he was promoted to captain on June 5, 1861.
The 11th Indiana Infantry was sent to the Washington, D.C. area, participated in several skirmishes, but missed the first battle of Bull Run. Their 3-month term of enlistment expired, the regiment was shipped back to Indianapolis and mustered out. When Wallace then formed a new 11th Indiana Infantry in August 1861, Knefler was commissioned a captain in it. Soon after, however, Wallace became a brigadier general and Knefler went with him as his assistant adjutant general.
Aide to General Lew Wallace.
Wallace’s brigade was part of Grant’s force in the capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, playing a key part in preventing the Confederate forces from forcing an escape from Fort Donelson through the Union lines. Wallace's report of the battle stated that Knefler’s “prompt and efficient service in the field” and his “courage and fidelity have earned my lasting gratitude.”
Knefler was also with Wallace in the Battle of Shiloh, and his loss of the messenger's written transcription of Grant’s oral order during the battle probably prevented resolution of the dispute between the two generals over whether the ambiguity of the order or Wallace’s actions caused his failure to reach the battle on the first day.
Colonel of 79th Indiana Infantry.
After Wallace’s removal from active service, Indiana governor Oliver Morton appointed Knefler the commanding colonel of the newly formed 79th Indiana Infantry in August 1862. Sent to join Buell’s Army of the Ohio, his regiment, as part of the brigade led by Brigadier General Samuel Beatty, became involved in the battles of Stones River, Chickamauga, and Missionary Ridge. At Stones River, Knefler reported his regiment lost one-third of its 341 men, including one-half of its commissioned officers. The 79th Indiana captured a key battery during the first day of Chickamauga, but was cut in half in the Confederate breakthrough on the second day, Knefler’s half attempting to regroup Beatty’s brigade until withdrawn, the other half helping hold Snodgrass Hill until the Confederate charge was finally repulsed. In the battle of Missionary Ridge, Knefler was in command of the combined 79th Indiana and 86th Indiana infantry regiments that led the unexpected charge up the center of the ridge. General Beatty’s report after the battle complimented Knefler for the charging of Missionary Ridge, and fellow colonel George Dick wrote that he “richly merits a commission as brigadier-general for his gallantry displayed in the charging and taking of Missionary Ridge.”
According to the Jewish-American History Foundation [http://www.jewish-history.com/civilwar/knefler.html] in recognition of the services rendered by the regiment at Chickamauga, the state of Indiana erected a monument on the battlefield after the war. The tablet of the monument reads:
INDIANA'S TRIBUTE
TO HER
SEVENTY-NINTH REGIMENT INFANTRY
Col. Frederick Knefler, Commanding
First Brigade (Samuel Beatty)
Third Division (Van Cleve)
Twenty-first Corps (Crittenden)
Atlanta Campaign.
Following Missionary Ridge, the 79th Indiana moved toward Knoxville and participated in the east Tennessee winter campaign until transferred to join General Sherman’s Atlanta Campaign. During this campaign, because of General Beatty’s illness, Knefler was given command of the entire brigade, although remaining a colonel. Knefler’s brigade participated in the entire campaign, playing a major role in the battles of Pickett’s Mill, Peach Tree Creek, Jonesboro, and Lovejoy’s Station, and marching into Atlanta.
Promotion to brigadier general.
When Confederate general Hood decided to cut Sherman’s supply line by invading Tennessee, Knefler’s brigade was one of those sent to join General Thomas to counter Hood. In the battle of Franklin, Knefler’s brigade guarded one flank as Hood put all his effort into a massive charge on the Union center, and thus suffered few casualties. In the battle of Nashville, Knefler’s brigade on December 16, 1864 formed the reserve behind which the two charging brigades reformed after being repulsed. He then ordered his brigade to charge the confused enemy, forcing them into retreat and capturing much of their arms. On March 13, 1865 Knefler was brevetted brigadier general. 
Knefler’s brigade was part of the army preparing to move from east Tennessee into Virginia when the war ended. Following the final review of Thomas’s army in Nashville on May 9, 1865, he returned with the 79th Indiana Infantry to Indianapolis where he was mustered out.
Post-war activities.
Following the war, Knefler became a lawyer in Indianapolis, joining in partnership with former U. S. Attorney John Hanna. After his partner was elected in Congress in 1876, Knefler was appointed head of the pension office in Indianapolis by President Rutherford B. Hayes, where he served eight years. As president of the board of regents of Indiana’s Soldiers and Sailors Monument, he oversaw the laying of the cornerstone in the center of Indianapolis on August 22, 1889, but died before its completion in 1902.
He died June 14, 1901 in Indianapolis, Indiana and is buried Crown Hill Cemetery; his grave can be found in Section 8, Lot 22.

Katy Prairie Conservancy

Katy Prairie Conservancy (KPC) was established in 1992 to conserve Katy Prairie, part of the Western Gulf coastal grasslands located in Texas, United States. Its mission is "To protect a sustainable portion of the Katy Prairie
for the benefit of its wildlife and all Texans forever."
Background.
As Houston expands westward, valuable habitat, open space, traditional ecological functions and agricultural lands are lost. The prairie's very existence is now threatened by rapidly changing economic and social forces, which are formidable; however, loss of the prairie is not inevitable. In the fall of 1992, Katy Prairie Conservancy was established in the belief that creative cooperation among those with an interest in the prairie including landowners, developers, hunters, environmentalists, and local residents can result in consensus-based land management strategies without painful economic sacrifices or politically forced solutions to save this invaluable resource.
History of Katy Prairie.
Katy Prairie lies in the Texas Coastal Plain, and encompasses over a thousand square miles, (Wermund, 1994) bound by the Brazos River on the southwest, pine-hardwood forest on the north, and the city of Houston on the east. Historically, Katy Prairie was characterized as a poorly drained tall-grass prairie subject to periodic fires and containing a considerable amount of wetland areas.
Comanche and Karankawa Native Americans were the first humans to use the prairie, following the bison herds which grazed the area. The standing ponds were frequented by thousands of ducks. Up until the end of the 19th century, the prairie remained more or less untouched by Europeans. Around 1870 the first settlers began to raise corn, potatoes, and cattle on the prairie. At the turn of the century, rice farmers appeared, creating fields harvested by hand. Sportsmen began to take advantage of the hunting opportunities, hunting the indigenous ducks, Curlews, and Prairie Chickens. Small-scale agriculture had only a minor impact on the region, and the prairie remained primarily a plain/prairie ecosystem. In 1914, George Finlay Simmons described the area as still "a coastal prairie region with few farms and ranches; the only timber lies in strips from a quarter to a half mile wide along Buffalo and Bray's Bayous. The remainder of the country is flat, uncultivated prairie, sprinkled with small ponds and grassy marshes".
With the escalation of rice farming and population in the 1930s and 1940s came an increase in hunting and birding. Ducks remained the most popular species, but hunted species included snipe, cranes, doves, quail, rails, and geese. The presence of ducks and doves increased, directly due to the habitat availability afforded by the flooded rice fields. However, as farming ate up grassland areas, upland species such as the Prairie Chicken declined drastically.
Farming advancements during the 1950s and 1960s boosted rice farming to a large scale. It was at this time that the Snow Goose emerged onto the rairie. Historically, the snow goose wintered in the marshes and prairies along the coast. Vast amounts of available open-water habitat combined with waste rice created by modern farming methods created exceptionally conducive wintering grounds and thousands of geese moved inland to the new habitat. Migratory birds increasingly depend upon this habitat as other areas along the Gulf Coast have diminished in size or lost to development.
Eventually, developers began to appear on the prairie. The city of Houston experienced a huge growth spurt and began spreading to the west and northwest. From 1978 to 1983, of the prairie were converted to urban use, primarily residential, with some industrial and retail. This was coupled with a decline in rice farming, with land use for rice falling 59% in Waller County from 1980-1992.
Urbanization will have consequences for the future of the prairie, as agricultural use has been consistent with its role as a wildlife habitat for nearly one hundred years. Rice farms in particular provide the wetlands necessary for migratory waterfowl to thrive, while pastures and other croplands provide essential food and cover. Encroaching development puts this function at risk.
The Conservancy.
Missions and Goals.
The mission of Katy Prairie Conservancy is to preserve, protect, and enhance critical and sustainable portions of the Katy Prairie ecosystem, through -
Human communities are bound in subtle but profound ways to the land. United States history is tied in fundamental ways to the land the people have used, inhabited, developed, and all too often destroyed. Preserving Katy Prairie constitutes an act of faith in the community, the future, and ultimately, in everyone as caring and thoughtful stewards of nature.
Conservancy and how it works.
Katy Prairie Conservancy plans to accomplish its goals through use of established land trust strategies. They do not advocate political positions to achieve those objectives. Tools currently used to protect land on the prairie include:
The importance of Katy Prairie Conservancy.
Katy Prairie comprises a variety of habitats, including agricultural wetlands, depressional wetlands, creek corridors, and coastal grasslands.
Grassland.
Grasslands are characterized by grasses with extensive root systems, usually with many other herbaceous plants. The domination of grasses is facilitated by periodic drought, grazing, and wildfire (Chadwick, 1995). Coastal prairies in Texas and Louisiana extend 50 to 130 km (30 to 80 mi) inland from the marshes along the Gulf of Mexico. They are nearly level, with elevations from sea level to 75 m (250 ft).
The coastal prairies of the Texas coast once covered about 65,000 km² (13 million acres) from Kennedy County north to the Louisiana border. Today, however, it is estimated that under remain mostly under private ownership. The remaining grasslands are facing human and agricultural pressures with about one-third of the area cultivated for rice, sorghum, corn, and tame pastures. Much of the rest is threatened by aggressive non-native (also called exotic or noxious) invaders, most introduced intentionally by humans. These species, such as the Chinese tallow (Sapium sebiferum), have little value to native wildlife and can out-compete native plant species. The Louisiana Natural Heritage Program's classifies coastal prairie as "critically imperiled" and the Texas Natural Heritage Program's 1993 classification of the Little bluestem and Brownseed Paspalum community as "imperiled" and the Grama grass and Switchgrass community as "critically imperiled." Some of the individual grass species and other rare plants with which they are associated are in danger of becoming extinct, such as Texas windmill grass (Chloris Texensis).
Grasslands provide habitat for a wide variety of dependent wildlife, including many migratory birds and endangered species such as Attwater's Prairie Chicken, which formerly inhabited Katy Prairie. Prairies may be an important sink of carbon dioxide, which is of growing importance in light of concern over global climate changes. Prairies have produced the richest soils for agriculture in the world. They can be hayed, and they provide forage for livestock. Because no fertilizer is required and water is not as critical, the expense of managing native forage is much less than "improved" grass species. This invaluable natural resource has enabled the United States to become the "breadbasket of the world." As a result of continuing habitat loss, prairies have become perhaps the most threatened habitat in the United States.
Wetland.
In addition to its extensive grasslands, Katy Prairie also provides extensive wetland habitat. Wetlands are subject to periodic/constant inundation of water which saturates the soil and supports vegetation which can tolerate these soils. Over the course of the history of the United States, more than of wetlands have disappeared, down from an original total of . Over of the remaining area are considered too contaminated to be ecologically usable. In Texas, of coastal wetlands and 52% of the total wetland land has been lost, with ongoing loss of prairie wetlands and coastal marshes.
Wetlands like those found on Katy Prairie support a significant amount of industry. Coastal wetlands in the United States provide spawning habitat for 96% of commercial seafood and fishing grounds for about half the recreational users. They support the fur farming industry with $400 million annually. Texas marshlands have yielded up to 500,000 muskrat pelts a year alone. Hunters spend over $300 million to hunt wetland waterfowl. Wetlands are vital for the live bait and birdwatching industries. Annually, over 60 million people observe and photograph wildlife directly supported by wetlands. Wetlands also serve as food and water source for livestock. In the water cycle, wetlands are crucial in restoring ground-water levels, by collecting run-off and precipitation and allowing it to infiltrate slowly into the soil due to the slow water flow rates. This characteristic of water collection also serves to buffer floods, reducing storm surges and river flows. Wetlands are vital as dilution areas for toxic discharges.
Human and wildlife.
The diversity of habitats on Katy Prairie allows the co-existence of a variety of people and wildlife. Open spaces like this are crucial to maintaining the freedom and quality of rural life, supporting outdoor activities such as hunting and birding. The prairie supports a large amount of wildlife. An average total of 597,000 representatives of 196 different bird species were recorded in the 1977-1994 period during Christmas bird counts.
The Texas coastal prairie/marsh ecosystem originally supported large populations of alligators, bullfrogs, white-tailed deer, American bison, Pronghorn, American Black Bear, Eastern wild turkey, red wolf, Eastern Gray Squirrel, fox squirrel, and muskrat. Currently, beaver, alligator, deer, coyote, bobcat and squirrels still reside on the prairie. Katy Prairie is irreplaceable. It represents a unique resource which will continue to enhance the quality of life for the region's residents for years to come.
Katy Prairie Conservancy Preserves.
Nelson Farms Preserve.
Originally, Nelson Farms Preserve was part of the 1220 Farms property, one of many historic farms and ranches on the prairie. The Nelson family utilized the property for the production of rice, soybeans, cattle and crayfish. Historically, these agricultural wetlands provided critical winter foraging and roosting areas for a number of species of wetland-dependent wildlife, particularly birds. Today, Nelson Farms Preserve encompasses more than and still operates as a working rice farm to benefit wildlife dependent upon the agricultural wetlands present on the landscape. Cypress Creek flows through the preserve offering excellent habitat because of its perennial source of water and vegetative diversity. The unique combination of habitat types attracts significant numbers of waterfowl, waterbirds, migratory songbirds, raptor, beaver, white-tailed deer and other wildlife.
Warren Ranch.
Warren Ranch is one of the largest remaining working cattle ranches on the prairie. It abounds with wildlife and native plants and grasses. There are large concentrations of bushy bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and indiangrass as well as patches of more unusual species to the Houston area such as mesquite and yucca. Rare neotropical migrant birds such as Swainson's Warblers use habitat along Cypress Creek at the ranch’s southern end, while at the northern end Warren Lake serves as a major resting and roosting area for many species of duck, including Blue and Green-winged Teal, American Wigeon, Bufflehead, and Ruddy Duck, as well as for Snow Goose, Canada Goose, Ross's Goose and Bald Eagle. Wood Storks visit the lake in the summer and flocks of American White Pelicans can be seen there in the winter. The open country also harbors hawks, Bobwhite Quail, songbirds, jackrabbits, and deer.
Williams Prairie Preserve.
Williams Prairie is a remnant prairie full of little Bluestem, Brownseed Paspalum, and indiangrass. It was utilized historically as a hay meadow, which allowed it to survive in its relatively pristine state. Volunteers have identified 59 species of grass on the property. The Prairie is composed of mainly upland prairie with few shallow depressional wetlands that provide habitat for many species of butterfly, birds, and small animals. These two habitats work in conjunction to create the necessary diversity of species needed to maintain a productive native prairie seed bank. Egrets and other herons can be found residing year-round in the depressions as long as they continue to hold water during the warmer months. The same can be said for Ibises and Spoonbills who are frequently seen probing and sifting out invertebrates such as worms and Crayfish from below the water’s surface. Stilts and various Rails, Moorhens, and Coots can also be found in the shallow ponds and depressions.

The Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania (ASWP) incorporated in 1942, with a history dating back to 1916, is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve. The society obtained Todd Nature Reserve in 1942, and in 1977 began operating from Beechwood – a property with over of walking trails.
ASWP’s mission is “to inspire and educate the people of southwestern Pennsylvania to be respectful and responsible stewards of the natural world.” To that end, ASWP has a full-time education staff, a corps of volunteer naturalists who work to educate youth and adults through year-round programming, youth day camps in the summer, and a summer naturalist at Todd Nature Reserve from June to September. The society also runs a series of environmental education camp programs for local schools in the fall.
In addition to ongoing education, ASWP hosts a number of community events, beginning with Maple Madness in the early spring. In June, Audubon hosts Secret Garden events; in September, a fall festival called AppleJamm; and in October, a non-scary Halloween experience called Creatures of the Night.
The Audubon Nature Store, located at Beechwood, contains nature related and themed items for every occasion. Birdfeeders and birdseed are favorites of many customers, however the inventory includes clothing, optics, jewelry, books and more.
ASWP is dedicated to the stewardship of both Beechwood Farms and Todd Nature Reserves, which together total over of land. Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve's trails are open dawn to dusk year round, and Todd Nature Reserve trails are available dawn to dusk except during the Pennsylvania Deer Hunting Season.
Conservation initiatives.
ASWP is involved in a number of conservation initiatives. First, the society works to publicize and aid in the stewardship of the Buffalo Creek Valley, Raccoon Creek, Enlow Fork, and Lower Buffalo Creek Valley Important Bird Areas. The society is also in the midst of a barn owl research program, to develop a protocol for reintroducing barn owls to areas where their populations may be at risk. The Audubon Center for Native Plants, a nursery developed to propagate native plants is located at Beechwood. Native Plants are made available for purchase from May through September, and the society partners with numerous organizations to promote the use of native plants in Western Pennsylvania. ASWP has recently completed administration of a Watershed Conservation Plan for the Buffalo Creek Watershed, where Todd Nature Reserve is located.

Chuck Stevens

Charles Augustus Stevens, Jr. (born July 10, 1918) is a former first baseman in Major League Baseball who played for the St. Louis Browns in parts of three seasons (1941, 1946, 1948). Listed at 6' 1", 180 lb., Stevens was a switch-hitter and threw left-handed. He was born in Van Houten, New Mexico.
Career.
Stevens spent 20 years playing, coaching and managing professional baseball, much of it in the Pacific Coast League, but he is best remembered as the player who delivered the first major league hit off pitching legend Satchel Paige.
At a young age Stevens played baseball and basketball, but he also was always interested in music, playing guitar, fiddle and percussion, and became an accomplished tap dancer in his youth. Following his graduation from Long Beach Polytechnic High School in early 1937, he enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley, but he turned his attention to baseball and signed a contract with the St. Louis Browns of the American League before the 1938 season. He went to spring training in San Antonio, Texas before reporting to the Williamston Class-D team of the Coastal Plain League, where he hit .288 with 10 home runs in 97 games. in 1939 was promoted to Class-C Johnstown of the Middle Atlantic League, where he hit .290 in 128 games. His most productive season came in 1940 with Class-B Springfield of the Three-I League, when he hit .316 with 74 RBI for a team that won the league championship. His rapid advancement through theBrowns system indicated that he could be considered a major league prospect. He moved up again in 1940, this time to Class-A San Antonio of the Texas League. He did not hit quite as well (.264 in 158 games), but gained attention for his flashy defense at first base and his aggressive base running. Then he was added to the Browns roster in late September, but did not appear in any games.
In 1941 Stevens joined the Double-A Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association, one step below the major leagues. He had a fine season for the Mud Hens, hitting .290 in 145 games, earning a promotion to the Browns in September. He appeared in four games and went 2-for-13 (.154) with two runs and two RBI. He returned to Toledo in 1942 but had a disappointing season, slumping to .250 and did not get the September recall he was likely hoping for. After the season, he entered the US Army Air Force and spent the next three years in the Pacific Theatre, first in California and later in Tinian, Guam, and Okinawa.
Stevens rejoined the Browns after being discharged before the 1946 season, appearing in 122 games while hitting .248 with three home runs. As always, his defense and base-running were generally first rate, but his lack of power kept him from a longer career in the majors. In 1947 he was outrighted back to Toledo, where he batted .279 in 141 games. He returned to the Browns in 1948, just in time to take part in a bit of baseball history on July 9 at Cleveland Stadium. With the Browns beating the Cleveland Indians 4–1 in the bottom of the fourth inning, Cleveland manager Lou Boudreau pulled his starting pitcher, Bob Lemon, replacing him with the 41-year-old rookie Satchel Paige to start the fifth inning. It was Paige's first game in the major leagues, and the first batter he faced was Stevens, who had faced Paige many times in exhibition matches in California, and remembered hitting him pretty well. In this instance, he spoiled the story by lining a single to left field on the second pitch he saw. Nevertheless, Paige retired the next three hitters to get out of the inning unscathed. During his third stint with the Browns, Stevens hit a .260 average in 85 games, and was sold to the Hollywood Stars (PCL), hitting for them .321 over 38 games at the tail end of the 1948 season.
Stevens played for Hollywood until 1954, and was part of three PCL championships with the Stars in 1949, 1952 and 1953. He was remarkably consistent during this period, hitting .297, .288, .292 and .278 from 1949 through 1952, as well as playing his typical solid defense at first base. The Stars sold Stevens contract to the San Francisco Seals (PCL). He played for his new team for the next year and a half as a reserve player and pinch hitter, also serving as a player-coach for the 1955 season. When the Boston Red Sox purchased the Seals at the end of the season, Stevens was sent along with some of their other surplus players to the Louisville Colonels (American Association). But Stevens had no interest in going to the new team, instead buying out his own contract so that he could take an opportunity to manage the Amarillo Gold Sox in the Western League. He hit .335 for Amarillo in 1956, and also managed his team to the league's title series, earning the circuit's manager of the year award. He later played and coached for the Sacramento Solons (PCL) in 1957, his last professional baseball season.

<doc id="20000400" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20000400" title="Job performance">
Job performance

Job performance is a commonly used, yet poorly defined concept in industrial and organizational psychology, the branch of psychology that deals with the workplace. It's also part of Human Resources Management. It most commonly refers to whether a person performs their job well. Despite the confusion over how it should be exactly defined, performance is an extremely important criterion that relates to organizational outcomes and success. Among the most commonly accepted theories of job performance comes from the work of John P. Campbell and colleagues. Coming from a psychological perspective, Campbell describes job performance as an individual level variable. That is, performance is something a single person does. This differentiates it from more encompassing constructs such as organizational performance or national performance which are higher level variables.
Features of job performance.
There are several key features to Campbell's conceptualization of job performance which help clarify what job performance means.
Performance versus outcomes.
First, Campbell defines performance as behavior. It is something done by the employee. This concept differentiates performance from outcomes. Outcomes are the result of an individual's performance, but they are also the result of other influences. In other words, there are more factors that determine outcomes than just an employee's behaviors and actions.
Campbell allows for exceptions when defining performance as behavior. For instance, he clarifies that performance does not have to be directly observable actions of an individual. It can consist of mental productions such as answers or decisions. However, performance needs to be under the individual's control, regardless of whether the performance of interest is mental or behavioral.
The difference between individual controlled action and outcomes is best conveyed through an example. On a sales job, a favorable outcome is a certain level of revenue generated through the sale of something (merchandise, some service, insurance). Revenue can be generated or not, depending on the behavior of employees. When the employee performs this sales job well, he is able to move more merchandise. However, certain factors other than employees' behavior influence revenue generated. For example, sales might slump due to economic conditions, changes in customer preferences, production bottlenecks, etc. In these conditions, employee performance can be adequate, yet sales can still be low. The first is performance and the second is the effectiveness of that performance. These two can be decoupled because performance is not the same as effectiveness.
Another closely related construct is productivity. This can be thought of as a comparison of the amount of effectiveness that results from a certain level of cost associated with that effectiveness. In other words, effectiveness is the ratio of outputs to inputs—those inputs being effort, monetary costs, resources, etc. 
Utility is another related construct which is defined as the value of a particular level of performance, effectiveness, or productivity. Utilities of performance, effectiveness, and productivity are value judgments.
Organizational goal relevance.
Another key feature of job performance is that it has to be goal relevant. Performance must be directed toward organizational goals that are relevant to the job or role. Therefore, performance does not include activities where effort is expended toward achieving peripheral goals. For example, the effort put toward the goal of getting to work in the shortest amount of time is not performance (except where it is concerned with avoiding lateness).
Multidimensionality.
Despite the emphasis on defining and predicting job performance, it is not a single unified construct. There are vastly many jobs each with different performance standards. Therefore, job performance is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct consisting of more than one kind of behavior. Campbell (1990) proposed an eight factor model of performance based on factor analytic research that attempts to capture dimensions of job performance existent (to a greater or lesser extent) across all jobs.
Another taxonomy of job performance was proposed and developed for the US Navy by Murphy (1994). This model is significantly broader and breaks performance into only four dimensions.
In addition to these models dividing performance into dimensions, others have identified different types of behaviors making up performance.
Different types of performance.
Another way to divide up performance is in terms of task and contextual (citizenship and counterproductive) behaviors. Whereas task performance describes obligatory behaviors, contextual behaviors are behaviors that do not fulfill specific aspects of the job's required role. Citizenship behaviors are defined as behaviors which contribute to the goals of the organization through their effect on the social and psychological conditions. Counterproductive behaviors, on the other hand, are intentional actions by employees which circumvent the aims of the organization.
Determinants of performance.
A meta-analysis of selection methods in personnel psychology found that general mental ability was the best overall predictor of job performance and training performance.
Campbell (1990) also suggested determinants of performance components. Individual differences on performance are a function of three main determinants: declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge and skill, and motivation.
Declarative knowledge refers to knowledge about facts, principles, objects, etc. It represents the knowledge of a given task's requirements. For instance, declarative knowledge includes knowledge of principles, facts, ideas, etc.
If declarative knowledge is knowing what to do, procedural knowledge and skill is knowing how to do it. For example, procedural knowledge and skill includes cognitive skill, perceptual skill, interpersonal skill, etc.
The third predictor of performance is motivation, which refers to "a combined effect from three choice behaviors—choice to expend effort, choice of level of effort to expend, and choice to persist in the expenditure of that level of effort" (Campbell, 1990). It reflects the direction, intensity, and persistence of volitional behaviors. Campbell (1990) emphasized that the only way to discuss motivation as a direct determinant of behavior is as one or more of these choices.
Campbell (1990) also mentioned several performance parameters that may have important implications for the job performance setting and should be investigated by industrial and organizational psychologists.
The first one is the distinction between speed and accuracy. This distinction is similar to the one between quantity and quality. Important questions that should be considered include: which is most valued by the organization, maximized speed, maximized accuracy, or some balance between the two? What kind of trade offs should an employee makes? The latter question is important because speed and accuracy for the same task may be independent of one another.
The second distinction is between typical and maximum performance. Sackett, Zedeck, and Fogli did a study on supermarket cashiers and found that there was a substantial difference between scores reflecting their typical performance and scores reflecting their maximum performance. This study suggested the distinction between typical and maximum performance. Regular work situations reflect varying levels of motivation which result in typical performance. Special circumstances generate maximum employee motivation which results in maximum performance.
Additionally,the impact of organizational justice perceptions on performance is believed to stem from Equity Theory. This would suggest that when people perceive injustice they seek to restore justice. One way that employees restore justice is by altering their level of performance. Procedural justice affects performance as a result of its impact on employee attitudes. Distributive justice affects performance when efficiency and productivity are involved. Improving justice perceptions improves productivity and performance.
Core self-evaluations.
Job performance is a consistent and important outcome of core self-evaluations (CSE). The concept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997) as a dispositional predictor of job satisfaction, and involves four personality dimensions; locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. The way in which people appraise themselves using core self-evaluations has the ability to predict positive work outcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and job performance. The most popular theory relating the CSE trait to job performance argues that people with high CSE will be more motivated to perform well because they are confident they have the ability to do so. Motivation is generally the most accepted mediator of the core self-evaluations and job performance relationship. These relationships have inspired increasing amounts of research on core self-evaluations and suggest valuable implications about the importance this trait may have for organizations.

The Aesthetic Dimension

The Aesthetic Dimension: Toward a Critique of Marxist Aesthetics () is a 1977 book about aesthetics by philosopher Herbert Marcuse. It explicates Marcuse's account of modern art's political implications and relationship with society at large.
It is the final major work by Marcuse, best known as a founding member of the Frankfurt School. The book is also noteworthy as a demarcation of his split with Marxism via his rejection of Marxist aesthetics.
Summary.
"The Aesthetic Dimension" (not to be confused with a chapter from Marcuse's "Eros and Civilization" of the same name) is a response to previous writings within critical theory on the subject of art, notably those of Walter Benjamin and Theodor Adorno. Marcuse rejects Benjamin's call in "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" for the politicization (i.e., a literal reflection of perceived political realities) of modern, reproducible art to both reflect the state of a society and incite change. Like both Benjamin and Adorno, Marcuse feels that art promises resistance to societal repression, and that a cultural revolution is necessarily connected to a political and/or social revolution. Adorno (as represented mainly by his posthumous "Aesthetic Theory") and Marcuse agree that this possibility must be realized through artistic detachment and symbolism, but Marcuse offers a more inclusive and less radical suggestion for modern art's source of power than does Adorno, who believes the works of high culture to be the sole source of potential artistic emancipation.
Marcuse instead points to what he perceives to be the successes of high culture and translates these to all areas of art. For Marcuse, art's promise of transcendence can only be fulfilled via a conceptual independence from society, but this independence is accessible through a host of media. The successful artist will attain "truth" in his work through "detachment" that results in "symbolic representation." This successful art must necessarily invoke a longing for something utopian and the promise of ultimate happiness represented by beauty. This symbolic longing for fulfillment will awaken us from complacency.
Marcuse states in the book's introduction that he considers literature the primary source of his influence for this system, but feels that the ideas would apply to music and plastic arts as well.

Ōmura Domain

In the han system, Ōmura was a political and economic abstraction based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields. In other words, the domain was defined in terms of "kokudaka", not land area. This was different from the feudalism of the West.
History.
Ōmura was settled in ancient times, and was controlled by the Ōmura clan since the 12th century. The Ōmura clan claimed descent from Fujiwara no Sumitomo (d. 941). Ōmura Tadazumi, an 8th generation descendant from Fujiwara of Sumitomo, was the first to take the Ōmura name, from the location of his castle and estates. Among his descendants was Ōmura Sumitada (1532–1587), one of the Christian daimyo of Kyūshū. Sumitada opened the port of Nagasaki to the Portuguese and sponsored its development. Following Toyotomi Hideyoshi's campaign against the Shimazu clan, the Ōmura were confirmed in their holdings, though Nagasaki was taken from the Jesuits and made into a "chokkatsu-ryō", or direct landholding, of the Toyotomi administration. His son, Ōmura Yoshiaki (1568–1615) sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara, but was forced to give up his domains to his son, Ōmura Sumiyori (d. 1619). Sumiyori had been baptized like his father and grandfather, but with the promulgation of the edicts banning Christianity, he became an apostate and persecuted the Christians in his domain. The Ōmura thus gained the trust of the Tokugawa Shogunate, and were confirmed in their holdings of 27,900 "koku" until the Meiji Restoration.
The final daimyo, Ōmura Sumihiro, was initially a strong supporter of the Tokugawa government, and was entrusted with the position of Nagasaki bugyō in 1862. However, he defected to the Sonnō jōi side in 1864, and joined with the Satchō Alliance in the Boshin War. In 1871, with the abolition of the han system, Ōmura domain became part of the new Nagasaki Prefecture. 
His son, Ōmura Sumio was elevated to the rank of viscount ("shishaku") in the "kazoku" peerage system in 1884, and further elevated to count ("hakushaku") in 1891. However, as he had no son, he adopted his son-in-law, the son of Shimazu Tadahiro to be his heir.
The former Ōmura domain is now part of Ōmura city, Nagasaki Prefecture.

The Fear (Lily Allen song)

"The Fear" is a song by British recording artist Lily Allen from her second studio album, "It's Not Me, It's You" (2009). Written by Allen and Greg Kurstin, the song was released as the lead single of the album. Initially, "Everyone's at It" was announced to be the first single from the album. However, it was ultimately decided on "The Fear" to be released on 26 January 2009 by Regal Recordings, while the demo leaked onto the Internet in April 2008. The song incorporates electropop music as the lyrics articulate problems with celebrity lifestyles and include metaphors for recognised tabloid national newspapers such as The Sun. "The Fear" also references, albeit indirectly, the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Contemporary critics complimented the song and its themes of consumerism and the supposed postmodern condition, although some called it a cliché and an understatement for Allen's past media controversies. "The Fear" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, where it remained for four weeks. The single peaked also inside the top 20 of the charts of some European countries and Australia. It is also the singer's second chart entry in the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100.
The accompanying music video portrayed a fantasy theme, with Allen dancing with giant wrapped gifts and balloons. It was shot at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire and also featured dancers dressed as butlers; the locations were initially in a caravan in a park, and then in a giant colourful mansion, surrounded by contrasting grey clouds. The song was performed live for the first time via "The Scott Mills Show" on BBC Radio 1 and during Allen's 2009 concert tour. "The Fear" was awarded with "Best Track" prize at the 2009 Q Awards, and also won Allen two Ivor Novello Awards in 2010, for best song musically and lyrically, and most performed work.
Background and composition.
Initially, the song "Everyone's At It" was announced to be released as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on "The Fear". While discussing "It's Not Me, It's You", Allen stated that her intention was to make "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit as a person and I hope it reflects that." She released a demo version of the song, which was then called "I Don't Know", onto her MySpace account, along with another song, "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [I'll] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village in the middle of the countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture — but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.
Musically, Allen adopts a more mature electropop groove for the song, which has been described to have "a pulsing, sleekly modern electro dance backing", while coming through a "flood of soft synths" and being "eminently danceable and slightly trancey". It is set in common time and in the key of F major and has a metronome of 134 beats per minute. Allen's voice spans from D flat to B flat. Lyrically, the song is a rant about materialism "sung in the voice of a would-be starlet", and tackles societal consumerism and overnight-fame-hunting. It also makes reference, through the line "I'll look at The Sun and I'll look in The Mirror", at the daily British tabloid national newspapers "The Sun" and "Daily Mirror", which often report on Allen.
The synthesiser parts were written by Greg Kurstin using Apple's Logic Studio, using its built-in instruments.
Critical reception.
Michael Menachem from "Billboard" commented on the song, saying it "packs another lyrical punch", while complimenting Allen's vocals. The BBC interpreted the song, in which Allen " apologises for her avarice, confidently blaming the system", but also complimented the "exquisite" production. Neil McCormick from "The Daily Telegraph" suggested that the song confirms that the singer's "pithy observational skills and sweet musicality" remain intact, as she has been a bit bruised by her encounter with 21st-century fame. "Clash" reporter Natasha Arico concluded that "The Fear" is somewhat trite, though "sickeningly catchy and dance friendly", while "Rolling Stone" magazine criticised the song for being a "cliché" delivered by Allen "with sneer". James Montgomery of MTV gave a good review, saying its a relatively scathing indictment of today's glossy, "celeb-ified culture". Ryan Dombal from Pitchfork Media described the song to have a "part admission, part brag, part apocalyptic vision" and suggested that "for almost any other artist, the lines would be barbed, sarcastic, and, ultimately, uppity and bland indictments. But not for the loudmouth ".
Other reviews were also positive; Sal Cinquemani form "Slant Magazine" suggested that "The Fear" is proof of the pop singer's self-awareness, but, given her own personal tabloid history, the song possesses a trail of irony: "I'll look at "The Sun" and I'll look in "The Mirror"/I'm on the right track, yeah, we're onto a winner." Leah Greenblatt of "Entertainment Weekly" liked the song, in which Allen makes fun of her own material-girl ID and went on to say that it is in fact "a tale of two Lilys: the naughty postadolescent in the rearview mirror, and the fully realized female coming around the bend." Chris Buckle from "The Skinny" gave "The Fear" three stars, commenting that it "is a potent reminder that she’s more than just gobby gossip-fodder", but also disliked a few lyrics, which "in particular a clumsy attempt to inject politics amongst the celeb-woe naval-gazing", while About.com praised the song for being a "pop masterpiece", Allen's "witty intelligent lyrics" and compared it to Pink's "Stupid Girls".
In January 2011 Allen supported a suggestion by the Bishop of Sheffield that people could listen to the song as part of a lenten Bible study course.
Commercial performance.
In the United Kingdom, "The Fear" debuted at number one hundred and sixty eight on the UK Singles Chart on 25 January 2009 ― for the week ending dated 31 January 2009. The following week, the song climbed 167 places to reach number one, thwarting Lady Gaga's "Just Dance" from the summit of the chart. Gaga commented on this, saying "I'm very familiar with Lily's music and good job Lily for knocking me off. There always deserves to be a female on top and I don't want to be the only one to do it. I think generally that pop music is making an enormous comeback and I'm actually very pleased with Lily Allen's new record as it's decidedly pop". The song managed to remain on top for four weeks, throughout the whole of February, until it was dethroned by Kelly Clarkson's "My Life Would Suck Without You". It thus earned Allen's second chart-topper, since her debut single, "Smile", achieved the feat in July 2006. On the single's third week stay at number one, its parent album, "It's Not Me, It's You" topped the UK Albums Chart, having a chart double, to which Allen said: "It's great being at the top of both charts, especially in the same week as the Brit Awards are once again celebrating the best of British music." It shared similar success in Australia, where it peaked at number three on the ARIA Singles Chart and stayed eight consecutive weeks in the top ten, and was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. In Ireland, "The Fear" entered at thirty nine on the Irish Singles Chart, making a slow rise to number five, where it remained for one week after descending the chart. 
The song became a success in Europe, having entered the top 20 in most of its countries, which resulted in a peak of three on the European Hot 100. Also, in New Zealand, Allen scored her fourth top 40 hit with the song placing itself at a peak of fourteen on the New Zealand Singles Chart.
In North America, "The Fear" shared moderate success, charting at number 80 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, making it Allen's only second entry in the U.S. Despite low positions in the main chart, the single managed to become the singer's first Hot Dance Club Play number-one single, topping it for one week. In Canada, it debuted at 57 in late 2008, afterwards leaving the chart for seven weeks; it returned in 2009, peaking at 33. It was certified Gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for shipments of over 20,000 copies.
Music video.
The music video was principally at shot at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire and directed by Nez. It premiered on Channel 4 on 4 December 2008. It starts off with Allen singing from a caravan window, while a clothes line on the right has underwear and a teddybear hanging from it. As she exits, her clothes are revealed to be a smock dress with a big bow and high heels; upon returning through the caravan door, the interior changes to that of a luxurious mansion, in reality an English country estate. The chorus starts and she walks down the hall, surrounded by butlers, all making synchronized moves and starting a choreography with Allen. Afterwards, she climbes the stairs and the camera cuts to the next scene, where she is sitting down in front of the mirror in an extravagant bedroom, with dresses, lamps, toys and cupcakes. The scene changes once again, with Allen walking into a room with giant, brightly coloured presents. They suddenly stand up, having two human legs, and begin to spin around, with the singer joining them. After descending the stairs and walking through the same hall she entered, she exits the estate, and the video takes down a darker, more serious tone, while the verse "Forget about guns and forget ammunition/'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission/Now I’m not a saint but I’m not a sinner/Now everything is cool as long as I’m getting thinner" is sung. The euphoric visual effects appear once again soon after, as the chorus takes place. Allen walks down the estate stairs, being surrounded by dancing balloons, hopping butlers and coloured fog. The camera zooms out showing the estate tied in a giant ribbon, but also grey, melancholic clouds, which contrast the cheerful party from before. Allen stated that she hoped the music video would convey parts of the song's sarcasm.
The video reportedly cost £50,000. During the shoot, the video was documented by MTV; in the interview, Allen declared: I wanted to do a dance routine, even though I'm not really doing a dance routine, other people are doing it, but I'm part of it. I think people are quite used to girls in this industry really being able to move in front of the camera, but I'm just rubbish at that kind of thing.
I find it quite nerve-racking performing, actually. Because when you write songs, you don't really think about performing in a video. I think it's quite fun. Lots of colour and dancing, and it's about doing something that's in keeping with the song, actually.
Live performances.
While being invited to the BBC show hosted by Scott Mills, Allen talked about her struggles with the paparazzi and also premiered the song by performing it live. Other live performances of the song include the "Sound" on BBC 2 with Nick Grimshaw and Annie Mac, "Friday Night" with Jonathan Ross, the Orange unsignedAct, and "The Sunday Night Project".
In February 2009, she was invited at "The Today Show" with Matt Lauer, where she performed the song after an interview. The same month, she made an appearance on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show", and while she was singing, DeGeneres freely dispensed copies of "It's Not Me, It's You" to the audience. Afterwards, both Allen and DeGeneres performed a rendition of the song "Womanizer" by American singer Britney Spears.
Allen included the song on her 2009 concert tour setlist, as part of the encore. "The Fear" was also performed at the 2010 BRIT Awards, as the opening song. Allen arrived on stage sitting on a rocket hoisted in the air, while wearing a black corset dress. She was later joined on stage by paratroopers dressed in pink military camouflage and women with Silver Cross prams.
Media appearances.
The song was featured in the fourth episode of series three of the TV drama "Skins", and, also, an instrumental version is used as accompanying music by "Match of the Day 2" during the review segment showing the goals. "The Fear" was parodied by the character playing Kevin Rudd on the TV show "Double Take", in which the lyrics are altered to deal with the voting campaign for Prime Minister in Australia. The song was covered by JLS for BBC Radio 1's "Live Lounge" segment of Jo Whiley's show on 15 September 2009, featuring an interpolation of the Beyoncé hit "Halo".

Memorials to the Missing

Memorials to the Missing is a radio play from the BBC Radio 4 Afternoon Play strand on the establishment of the Imperial War Graves Commission, first broadcast early in 2008 and repeated on 30 October 2008. It was written by Stephen Wyatt and directed by Martin Jenkins. It won the 2008 Tinniswood Award for Best Original Radio Drama Script at the Sony Radio Academy Awards. 
Plot.
It is centred around a fictional address given by Ware at the opening of the Thiepval Memorial, with flashbacks to his Red Cross work at the start of the war and his struggles against fierce opposition ever since to have war casualties buried where they fell under uniform headstones with no distinction of faith or rank. It is also interspersed with actuality recordings of present-day visitors to CWGC graves and with the voices of the soldiers commemorated 'haunting' Ware telling their own stories.
Cast.
Other minor characters included Herbert Baker (Lutyens' initial opponent, going on to suggest the standard IWGC Cross of Sacrifice to Christianise the cemeteries), Charles Aitken (another architect who recommended a memorial institution rather than spending on war graves) and William Burdett-Coutts (MP for Westminster), whilst 'offstage' characters included Rudyard Kipling.

Line 2 (Naples metro)

Line 2 (Italian: "Linea 2") is a commuter rail service operated by Trenitalia in the city of Naples, Italy. It connects 11 stations. 
Line 2 operates on the Villa Literno–Napoli Gianturco railway, which crosses the city of Naples from west to east.
History.
The construction of the line, part of the ″direttissima″ Rome–Naples, was begun in 1911 and after a suspension during World War I, it was completed in 1925 between "Pozzuoli" and "Piazza Garibaldi", electrified with third rail. Two years later the ″direttissima″ was completed, and the electrical rail service was extended towars Villa Literno and Gianturco. 
In November 1935 the line was also electrified with overhead line; the third rail was discontinued in 1938.
In 1997, the line was numbered as "Line 2", while the proper metro line became "Line 1". The two lines were connected with a pedestrian tunnel between "Museo" and "Cavour" in 2002.
Nowadays the line is crossed by urban trains, and also by regional trains that reach Formia (westbound) and Capua, Castellammare and Salerno (eastbound).
Rolling stock.
The metropolitan service started in 1925 with third rail cars of type E.20 transferred from the Ferrovie Varesine.
In 1938 the third rail system was discontinued, and the E.20 substituted by the newer E.624 equipped with overhead line.
From 1962–63 the E.624 were moved and substituted by the new EMUs of type ALe 803, and from 1983 the ALe 724.

The Energy Saving Trust Recommended logo is a UK-based labelling and certification scheme for energy efficient products. A product that displays the logo shows that it has met strict criteria on energy saving. The scheme is run by the Energy Saving Trust and was launched in 2000. The logo is registered with the UK Patent Office and can be used by manufacturers, retailers and suppliers to signpost consumers to best-in-class energy efficient products.
How it works.
The product criteria are created and managed by the Energy Saving Trust Recommended team, then peer-reviewed by an independent panel of industry experts . The criteria are reviewed annually to make sure they still represent only the most efficient products. Over 5% of products are tested every year to check they meet the criteria, the highest percentage of any UK certification scheme of this type.
Where you can find the label?
The Energy Saving Trust Recommended label can be found across 31 product types in 7 product sectors. These include:
Members.
Energy Saving Trust Recommended is a voluntary scheme which means all members put themselves and their products forward to be certified. As well as products meeting set standards on performance, all companies must meet the Energy Saving Trust's criteria in order to become a member.

White has to decide whether to force a draw by playing 20.Nxc5 Ra8 21.Qb7 Rb8 or to try to demonstrate the potential of the passed a-pawn, supported by two bishops, after 20.Nxc3 dxc3 which led to a position with mutual chances. 18…Rb5 19.Ne4 Ne5? White’s decisiveness is awarded surprisingly quickly. This mistake seems to be uncharacteristic of Antoaneta Stefanova who is, in general, in her element when playing complicated positions with tactical opportunities for both sides. And here comes the blunder! After a reasonable 19…Nc3 White would have been facing certain problems. For instance, 20.Bg5 (White’s queen is badly placed. So, 20.Nxc5? loses immediately to 20…Ne5, while after 20.Nxc3 dxc3 the threats Ne5 and Nxa5 leave white feeling uncomfortable) is answered by 20…Qc8 21.Nc3 (21.Nxc5? Ne5) 21...dxc3 22.Bf6 (22.Qxc3? Bd4 23.Qxc6 Bxa1 and white has no real compensation for the sacrificed material) 22…Qe6 23.Qxc3 Bb4 White can’t develop the initiative: 24.Qf3 Ne5 25.Qf4 Rxa5 26.Rab1 Be7 27.Bxe7 Qxe7 28.Rfe1 f6 leaves black with two “healthy” extra pawns for no real compensation. However, after Black’s mistake the rest is simple: 20.Qxd5 d3 21.Qxd8 Rxd8 22.Ba4 Rxa5 23.Bg5 Rb8 24.Bf6 Bf8 25.Bxe5 25...Rxe5 26.Nf6+ and 27.Nd7 1-0

Bjorøy

Bjorøy is an island in Fjell municipality, Hordaland, Norway. Located south of Litlesotra, Bjorøy is connected to Bergen by a subsea road tunnel, Bjorøytunnelen. It is also connected to the small island of Tyssøy in Sund municipality by a bridge. Bjorøy has 878 inhabitants (September 2012), and several hundred cabins.
History.
Due to its favourable location, proximity to Bergen, and the construction of the tunnel, the island has in recent years been seeing strong population growth. To prevent uncontrolled development, a building ban was instituted in 2007 but was later removed. The ban was instituted after a non-legally binding roof on ten new houses per year, whose purpose was to ensure that the population growth did not surpass the growth of drinking water availability and kindergarten capacity, among other things, proved ineffective.
Geography.
Bjorøy is located in the Raunefjord between the island of Store Sotra and Bergen. Although Bjorøy is connected only to Bergen by any means, the island is part of Fjell municipality. To its south is the smaller island of Tyssøy in Sund municipality, connected to Bjorøy by a bridge.
Transport.
The subsea tunnel Bjorøytunnelen was opened in 1996, replacing the ferry between the island and Alvøen in Bergen. Plans for a tunnel connecting Bjorøy with Bergen were presented in the late 1980s. By the early 1990s, the island's population had been decreasing for several years, and the sole grocery store on the island closed in 1991. In 1993, the Norwegian government approved the plans for the tunnel, and construction began the same year. The construction of the tunnel proved challenging: the bedrock quality was worse than anticipated. Delayed by almost a year, the tunnel finally opened on 7 May 1996.

Charity dating

Charity dating is a process of raising money for charity by being taken on a date by someone who will donate money to charity for the privilege. It is common for celebrities to help charitable causes by auctioning off a date with themselves to an audience.
History.
Charity dating has its roots in the controversial practice of Enjo-kōsai or 'compensated dating' which originates in Japan where older men give money or gifts to attractive women for their companionship. 
With the rise of celebrity culture many people are willing to pay large sums to meet their favorite celebrity. For example, Scarlett Johansson auctioned a pair of tickets to attend her premier, raising $40,100 dollars for Oxfam.
Formats.
The most common form of celebrity date auctions is through a charity fundraising event. These events are organized by charities or other parties and usually include dinner, speakers and other entertainment. 
More recently, the online auction site eBay has been used to allow a wider audience to bid for a date with a celebrity. One common auction is for the chance to attend a film premier with the celebrity. Examples include Scarlett Johansson, Kristin Davis and Colin Firth.
In May 2009, GiveAndDate.com launched in New York City. In September, The Chronicle of Philanthropy profiled how the for-profit dating site accepts donations to partnered charities when one user wants to send a message to another user.

Sceloporus occidentalis becki, commonly known as the island fence lizard, is a subspecies of the western fence lizard, "Sceloporus occidentalis". The subspecific epithet, "becki", is in honor of Rollo Howard Beck, an American ornithologist who collected the first specimens.
Geographic range.
The island fence lizard, S. o. becki is endemic to the Channel Islands of California.
Taxonomy.
Some authors have raised the island fence lizard to the rank of a species, i.e., "Sceloporus becki". However, recent work in molecular systematics has suggested four clades and 11 genetically separable populations, and the subspecies will probably have to be redefined.

Kingdom of France (Bourbon period 1589 - 1793).
On January 1, 1791, the Order of Saint Louis and the Order of Military Merit were merged into the Military Decoration by the Convention, the revolutionary parliament. (French: "la Decoration Militaire")

The French Third Republic (1870-1945).
The French Republic possessed in Asia, Africa and America a large colonial empire. For the purposes of this huge area, a number of "Colonial orders of knighthood" were established or incorporated.
They were :
In addition, the Governor-General of French Indo-China established in 1900 :
France had also not enough in the fatherland with the Legion of Honor. The various ministries therefore proposed that they themselves managed and issued orders to:
Fifteen of these orders were abolished by the first president of the Fifth Republic, Charles de Gaulle on 1 January 1964 and were replaced by the National Order of Merit but the three following were kept:

Ernie Finch

Ernie Finch (16 July 1899 - 1 October 1983) was a Welsh international rugby union wing and played club rugby for Llanelli and county rugby for the Western Counties. Finch is most notable as the player who scored an excellent solo try against the 1924 touring New Zealand 'Invincibles' in their match against Llanelli.
Born Ernest Finch in Pembroke Dock to Abram and Emily Finch. His father was a retired police officer who upon moving to Wales and marrying Emily, his second wife, became a school board attendance monitor.
Rugby career.
Finch first played senior rugby for local team Pembroke Dock Harlequins before moving to first class team Llanelli in 1922. Finch was first selected for Wales in the late game of the 1924 Five Nations Championship in an away game to France. Although Wales won, it was a messy Welsh performance caused by the decision of the Welsh Rugby Union officials to suspend Welsh player Ossie Male on the trip to Paris. The squad was thrown into turmoil, with several players being forced into unfamiliar positions. Finch managed to get his name on the scoreboard during the game when he scored one of two Welsh tries.
Finch was re-selected for the next Welsh international, this time against the touring New Zealand team. Wales were completely outclassed and lost the game 19-0, and Finch would face the All Blacks just four days later as his Llanelli team played host to the tourists. The New Zealanders faced far stiffer opposition as Llanelli went on the offensive. The forwards tackled with ferocity and Llanelli may have won with better kicking accuracy. In the match, Finch scored Llanelli's only points with a memorable solo try. Finch took a quick line-out, took the returning ball and left Hart flat-footed as he sped past him. With the try line in sight the only All Black defender was George Nepia. As Nepia closed in, Finch stopped dead, Nepia paused and then threw a tackle which Finch dodged, leaving him a clear try line to score over.
Finch was back in the Welsh squad in 1925 when he again faced France in the Five Nations Championship, this time in Wales at the Cardiff Arms Park. It was a more convincing Welsh performance and Finch scored two tries in an 11-5 victory. Finch held onto his place for the season's final Welsh international against Ireland, but found himself on the losing side against an impressive Irish team. In 1926 he played just one match, as part of Bobby Delahay's Welsh team to France, which Wales were narrow victors.
Finch missed all off the 1927 Championship for Wales, but was selected to face the touring Waratahs towards the end of the season; and although Wales lost, Finch managed his fourth and final international try for his country. Finch's final game for his country was in 1928 in Paris and it saw the first Welsh defeat by the French team. Five players from the game never represented their country again, and Finch was one of them.

Temple (LDS Church)

In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), a temple is a building dedicated to be a House of the Lord, and they are considered by Church members to be the most sacred structures on earth. Upon completion, temples are usually open to the public for a short period of time (an "Open House"). During the Open House, the church conducts tours of the temple with missionaries and members from the local area serving as tour guides, and all rooms of the temple are open to the public. The temple is then dedicated as a "House of the Lord", after which only members who are deemed worthy are permitted entrance. Thus, they are not churches (meetinghouses) but rather places of worship. The church is a prolific builder of temples as temples hold a key place in LDS theology. At present, there are temples in many U.S. states, as well as in many countries across the world. Several temples are at sacred sites of the LDS Church, such as Nauvoo, Illinois and Palmyra, New York. The importance of temples is often emphasized in weekly meetings, and regular participation in "temple work" is strongly encouraged for all Latter-day Saints (LDS).
Within temples, members of the church make covenants, receive instructions, and perform sacred ceremonies and ordinances, such as: baptism for the dead, washing and anointing (or "initiatory" ordinances), the endowment, and eternal marriage sealings. Ordinances are a vital part of the theology of the church, which teaches that they were practiced by the Lord's covenant people in all dispensations. Additionally, members consider the temple a place to commune with God, seek God’s aid, understand the will of God, and receive personal revelation.
History.
Biblical references - Old Testament.
Latter Day Saints cite various Old Testament references to temple ordinances such as those found in , and . The words "HOLINESS TO THE LORD" can be found on LDS temples as referenced in .
According to the LDS Bible Dictionary a temple is defined as::
Likewise the Tabernacle was considered a "portable temple" by the children of Israel in the Old Testament:
Post 1830 temples.
The first Latter-day Saint temple ceremonies were performed in Kirtland, Ohio, but differed significantly from the endowment performed on the second floor of Joseph Smith’s Red Brick Store in Nauvoo, Illinois and the Nauvoo Temple. Kirtland ordinances included washings and anointings (differing in many ways from the modern portion) and the washing of the feet ordinance. For nearly four years beginning in 1842, the prophet’s modest mercantile functioned as a de facto temple—the site of the first washings, anointings, endowments, and sealings. In contrast, the grand edifice known as the Nauvoo Temple was in operation for only two months before the Saints left Illinois for the West.
Preparations to initiate the first members of Joseph Smith's Quorum of the Anointed, or Holy Order, as it was also known, were made on May 3, 1842. The walls of the second level of the Red Brick Store were painted with garden-themed murals, the rooms fitted with carpets, potted plants, and a veil hung from the ceiling. All the while, the ground level continued to operate as Joseph Smith’s general mercantile.
After the early events of the succession crisis, Brigham Young assumed control of the church's headquarters at Nauvoo, Illinois. While he and the rest of the Quorum of the Twelve made contingency plans for abandoning the city, he may have hoped that it would not prove necessary. For example, in early 1845 he held a conference at the Norwegian colony at Norway, Illinois and announced a plan to build a Latter-day Saint town there with a temple for the use of the Norwegian Saints.
Meanwhile Young urged the Latter-day Saints in Nauvoo to redouble their efforts to finish the temple. By the end of 1845, the building was sufficiently finished to allow temple ordinances to be performed. Ordinances continued to be performed in early 1846 as the Mormons were forced to abandon the city. A small crew remained in the city and continued to work on the temple until April 30, 1846, when it was privately, yet formally, dedicated by Joseph Young, the senior of the Seven Presidents of the Seventy. It was used for 3 months, then abandoned in late Summer 1846. The completed temple was eventually destroyed by fire, and the remaining structure was later demolished by a whirlwind.
Upon reaching the Great Basin, Brigham Young began to build settlements based on the City of Zion plan and designated four of these to contain temples: Salt Lake City (1847), St. George (1871), Manti (1875), and Logan (1877). The St. George Temple was the first to be completed in 1877, followed by Logan (1884) and Manti (1888). The Salt Lake Temple took 40 years to complete because of various setbacks and delays. It was dedicated in 1893.
Latter-day Saint temple building halted until the presidency of Joseph F. Smith who announced two additional temples: Cardston, Alberta (1913) and Lā, Hawaii (1915). Cardston became the first Latter-day Saint temple dedicated outside of the United States. Smith broke with the previous tradition (established since Kirtland) of building temples with upper and lower courts. Temples previously had been ever larger, but the Laie, Hawaii temple was smaller than the Nauvoo Temple had been.
Both Cardston and Laie were dedicated under church president Heber J. Grant as was a temple in Mesa, Arizona. George Albert Smith dedicated the next temple in Idaho Falls, Idaho. David O. McKay dedicated five additional temples including one in Bern, Switzerland — which was the first temple dedicated in Europe and the first temple to use film recording of the endowment rather than live actors. Joseph Fielding Smith dedicated a temple in Ogden, Utah and Harold B. Lee dedicated its twin in Provo, Utah.
Spencer W. Kimball began a plan to build many more smaller temples according to standardized plans. Twenty-one temples were dedicated during his presidency, including the tiny Papeete Tahiti Temple — which was less than 10,000 square feet (900 m²). This trend has continued. Nine additional temples were dedicated in the presidency of Ezra Taft Benson and two in the brief presidency of Howard W. Hunter.
Under church president Gordon B. Hinckley, the church dedicated seventy-seven temples. In 1997, Hinckley introduced a standardized, smaller temple plan designed to bring temple services to smaller or remote congregations at a reduced cost. The first of this new generation of temples was completed in 1998 with the Monticello Utah Temple. The original plan called for , later increased to . Subsequent revisions to the standard design further increased the size and complexity of the temples. The majority of the temples dedicated under Hinckley's tenure were of the smaller design, but one particularly noteworthy achievement was the rebuilding of the temple in Nauvoo, Illinois, known as the Nauvoo Illinois Temple.
Twelve temples have been dedicated under current church president Thomas S. Monson (as of December 2011). 
Purposes.
Temples have a different purpose from LDS meetinghouses. Today, temples serve two main purposes: (1) Temples are locations in which worthy Latter-day Saints can perform sacred ordinances on behalf of themselves, their deceased ancestors, or unrelated deceased persons whose names are compiled from historical records through the church's Family Record Extraction Program. (2) Temples are considered to be Houses of Holiness where members can go to commune with God.
Ezra Taft Benson, a former church president, taught:
Such personal revelation can be received as needed, but many feel that it is easier to receive such revelation when one is in a place as peaceful and apart from the world as temples are.
Symbolism in the temple.
Many things in the temple are considered to be symbolic, from the clothing worn (those who attend the temple dress in white, a symbol of purity), to the building and rooms, to the ceremonies themselves.
Latter-day Saint temples are constructed with several symbolic elements meant to represent their religious theology. Each temple has the words "Holiness to the Lord" inscribed on it, representing the same inscription on the Old Testament Temple of Solomon.
Most temples are built facing East, pointing the direction from which Jesus Christ is prophesied to return. The spires and towers on the East end of multi-spired temples are elevated higher than spires and towers on the West side for this same reason, and to represent the Melchizedek, or Higher Priesthood. 
Some temples, like Salt Lake, Chicago, and Washington D.C. have triple spires on each side of the temple representing the three different offices in both the Melchizedek Priesthood and the Aaronic Priesthood. 
Stones carved with sun, moon, and earth or star designs are placed in ascending order around the Salt Lake Temple facade to represent the Latter-day Saint belief in a Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial Kingdom, or Three Degrees of Glory in the afterlife. However, they are arranged using the description of the woman found in Revelation 12:1 which says "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars."
A statue of the Angel Moroni, stands atop most temples built after the Salt Lake Temple. The statue design represents the Latter-day Saint belief that Moroni was the angel spoken of in Revelation 14.
Temple ordinances.
LDS Church members perform rituals (termed ordinances) within temples. They are taught that temple ordinances are essential to achieving the condition of Exaltation (Mormonism) after the final judgment. They are also taught that a vast number of dead souls exist in a condition termed as spirit prison, and that a dead individual upon whom the temple ordinances are completed will have a chance to be freed of this imprisoning condition. In this framework ordinances are said to be completed on behalf of either the participant, or a dead individual the same sex as the participant ("on behalf of the dead" or "by proxy"). 
Ordinances performed in the temple include:
Most ordinances are performed by proxy only on participants who have already completed the ordinance. Similarly, most ordinances are completed only one time for a participant in a lifetime and all subsequent temple ordinance participation is seen as acting for a dead individual. Baptism, Confirmation, and Priesthood Ordination are performed exclusively in temples when on behalf of the dead. The Initiatory, Endowment, and Sealing ceremonies are today performed only within a temple.
The Sealing ordinance can be performed on behalf of dead couples; and so long as the two participants are of opposite sex they do not have to be married. It is also performed on behalf of living couples who wish to be legally married. In this manner, the ordinance is typically performed as a celestial marriage, with the idea the marriage bond literally lasts after their death; "time and all eternity". A "time only" modification can be made to the ordinance; such as when the surviving widow of a celestial marriage wishes to legally remarry.
Entrance requirements.
The LDS Church booklet "Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple" explains that Latter-day Saints "do not discuss the temple ordinances outside the temples." Further, the booklet states:
To enter the temple, an individual must be baptized, and after one year, may seek a "temple recommend". The individual is interviewed by their bishop, during which they are asked a series of questions to determine their worthiness to enter the temple. The individual is also interviewed by their stake president. The bishop and stake president sign the recommend, indicating their approval of that member's worthiness. The individual also signs the recommend, acknowledging their responsibility to remain worthy to hold the recommend. A recommend is valid for two years.
Worthiness interview.
To qualify for a temple recommend, a member must faithfully answer a series of questions which affirm the individual's adherence to essential church doctrine. The questions address the following:
History of interview questions.
A list of questions were first introduced in 1857 and used to qualify whether an individual could enter the Endowment House, before the first temple was built. They reflected the context of the times, including questions about branding an animal that you did not own and using another person's irrigation water. Since then, the temple recommend questions have changed significantly, though less so in recent years. In 1996, the first question about a belief in God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost was split into three questions. A second question was modified to ask if the member sustained the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve as prophets, seers, and revelators. The question about wearing the garments was qualified, added a clause about wearing them as instructed in the temple. In 1999, a simplified question about financial obligations was asked of all members, not just divorced members. In 2012, the question about wearing the garments was slightly modified to clarify that the garments should not be worn separately.
Types of recommends.
The standard "Temple Recommend" authorizes a member who has been baptized at least one year prior to take part in all temple ordinances and is good for two years. A "Recommend for Living Ordinances" is given to individuals who are receiving their endowments for the first time, being sealed to a spouse, and anyone being married in the temple for time only. It may only be used in conjunction with a standard Temple Recommend. A "Limited-use Recommend" is available to members who have not yet received their endowment or who have not been a member for one year. These may also be issued to a group for a single visit to the temple. These can be issued to youth 12 and older who will take part in specific temple ordinances, to single members age 8-20 who are preparing to be sealed to their parents, or for individuals, not endowed, who want to observe specific ordinances. The church member must meet the same worthiness standards as a standard temple recommend in an interview with the member's bishop. Unlike the temple recommend, a limited-use recommend does not require a year's membership nor an interview with a stake president. A limited-use recommend is only valid for proxy baptisms and confirmation ordinances.
Emergency access.
Those without recommends occasionally need to enter temples after dedication during fires, medical emergencies, or building inspections. They are escorted by temple personnel during such visits. Temples may offer introductory tours to new local firefighters and emergency medical technicians during regularly scheduled maintenance periods.
Temple weddings.
The LDS temple wedding is a process which culminates in the participation by the couple in a ritual called the sealing ordinance; which involves pronouncing the couple as having a permanent marriage bond which persists even beyond death. This ceremony, among others, is taught as being vital to an individual's and family's exaltation status, following the final judgment. 
A temple marriage is held inside a temple, so a temple recommend is required to attend the ceremony. Couples who initially marry outside the temple must wait one year before they can be sealed in the temple; unless couples reside in situations where governments restrict the ability for a legal marriage to take place in the temple, as is the case in many European countries with strict secular marriage laws.
Receptions after the temple ceremony, or engagement parties before the temple marriage, can always be attended by anyone, since they are typically held at locations such as local LDS chapels, homes, other churches or other public venues.

Juglans hindsii

Juglans hindsii, with the common names Northern California walnut and Hinds' black walnut, is endemic to Northern California. 
Distribution.
The historical range of "Juglans hindsii" is from the San Joaquin Valley and Sacramento Valley to the Inner Northern California Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area, in Northern California. 
The tree grows in riparian woodlands, either in mono-species stands, or mixed with California oak species ("Quercus" spp.) and Fremont cottonwood ("Fremont cottonwood") trees. 
"Juglans hindsii" has only one confirmed native stand remaining. It is listed as Seriously Endangered on the California Native Plant Society Rare Plant Inventory. The IUCN classification is a Vulnerable species. It is threatened by hybridization with orchard trees, urbanization, and habitat conversion to agriculture.
Description.
"Juglans hindsi" is a large tree, growing tall. It has a single erect trunk, commonly without branches for , and a crown which can be wider than the tree is tall. Trunks commonly reach in diameter near the base of the tree. 
The leaf is approximately long, with 13-21 two to five per leaflet, with dentate margins. Unlike the Southern California walnut, the vein angles bear tufts of hair. 
The nut has a smooth, brown, thick shell, that contains a small edible nutmeat.
Uses.
Cultivation.
"Juglans hindsi" has been commercially important as a rootstock for orchard stock of "Juglans regia" (English walnut) trees all over the world. It is also used as a parent to the fast-growing Luther Burbank hybrid, commonly called "Paradox" ("Juglans hindsii" x "Juglans regia"). "Paradox" rootstock is a hybrid, produced from a Northern California black walnut tree pollinated by an English walnut. 
The Northern California walnut is cultivated by specialty California native plant nurseries. It is used as an ornamental tree in traditional and wildlife gardens, and for habitat gardens, natural landscaping projects, and climate compatible drought tolerant gardens. The tree is also planted in habitat restoration projects.
Lumber.
The wood of "Juglans hindsi" is commonly called Claro walnut by the lumber industry and woodworkers. It is highly figured with a rich brown color and striking grain patterns, especially in the crotch areas, where large limbs meet the trunk. It is used in small quantities to make fine furniture and gun stocks, and sold as slabs to make large natural-top tables because of its durability, good working properties, and swirling iridescent figure. 
Some confusion exists about the nature of Claro walnut because "Juglans hindsii" is commonly used as the rootstock of orchard trees. The section below the original graft is Claro walnut wood, while the section above is the lighter-colored English walnut. Some woodworkers have even taken advantage of this by making the change in color of the wood a feature of their work.
Taxonomy.
The current classification of the plant is as a distinct species. Some botanists and the 1993 edition of "The Jepson Manual" had classified it as "Juglans californica" subsp. "hindsii", a subspecies of "Juglans californica" (Southern California black walnut).

The protocol takes advantages of the multichannel scheme defined in WAVE and uses the Control Channel (CCH) for signalling, and relies on one of the multiple Service Channels (SCHs) for payload data dissemination.
Protocol design.
The Vehicular Reactive Routing (VRR) protocol is integrated with the WAVE stack and is embedded at the Logic Link Control layer. VRR is a multi-channel protocol which exercises efficient route discovery, route maintenance and data deliver processes with the use of the Control Channel (CCH) and a Service Channel (SCH). Standard WSA messages are transmitted over CCH and IPv6 packets are transmitted over SCH. To obtain a current neighbour location the WSA frame is modified to carry position information (incurs an additional 4 Bytes). Route request and route reply demands are transmitted inside WSA frames (additional 40 Bytes) over the Control Channel and data acknowledgment and all application data (IPv6 packets) are sent over the Service Channel.
Due to these modifications, a route is firstly established over the CCH and afterwards data are transmitted over the SCH.
VRR Protocol Messages.
The VRR protocol uses 3 signalling message types. Messages, route request (RREQ) and route reply (RREP) are broadcast on the CCH and acknowledgment (ACK) packets are transmitted on the SCH. Data packets are IPv6 packets and are transmitted after route discovery or route maintenance on one of SCHs. RREQ and RREP are situated inside the WRA field of WSA frame and on each hop the WSA frame is discarded and a new WSA frame created. Both messages are transmitted in the lowest Traffic Class (background).
VRR Broadcasting.
This algorithm is based on combination of three approaches
Principle of VRR Broadcasting simply like that:
A transmitter sends a broadcast data.
An advantage of VRR Broadcasting approach is that all receiving nodes have some opportunity to rebroadcast information (not only MPR nodes), but only a few nodes have the best opportunity (i.e. the shortest backoff time) for rebroadcasting. Another advantage is that in the case of the multipoint relay node not always receiving the broadcast due to collisions (in a dense busy network) then other nodes who overhear can transmit the information instead.
Route discovery technique.
The RREQ frames are broadcast by the VRR Broadcasting algorithm. If a node doesn't have a route to destination then the node rebroadcasts depend on the algorithm. If a node has a route to destination, it creates broadcast frame RREP and set up backoff time depend on mobility behaviour (distance from a transmitter, speed and vector of motion). If a RREP is transmitted by a transmitter, all neighbour's nodes received also the RREP and they discards own RREQ or RREP effort except node which is on a way to a source node.

1910–11 FA Cup

The 1910–11 FA Cup was the 40th season of the world's oldest association football competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (more usually known as the FA Cup). Bradford City won the competition for the first and (as of 2012) only time, beating Newcastle United 1–0 in the replay of the final at Old Trafford in Manchester, through a goal from Jimmy Speirs. The first match, held at Crystal Palace, London, was a 0–0 draw.
Matches were scheduled to be played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played, a replay would take place at the stadium of the second-named team later the same week. If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held at neutral venues until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.
1911 was the first year that the current trophy design was used. The FA commissioned Fattorini's of Bradford to design and manufacture a new, larger trophy. Coincidentally, it was won by Bradford City in its first outing. This trophy still exists but is now too fragile to be used, so an exact replica was made by Toye, Kenning and Spencer and has been in use since the 1992 final. The replica of the original, last used in 1910, was presented to the FA's long-serving president Lord Kinnaird. It was sold at Christie's in 2005 to David Gold. Gold has loaned this trophy to the National Football Museum in Manchester where it is on permanent display.
Calendar.
The format of the FA Cup for the season had two preliminary rounds, five qualifying rounds, four proper rounds, and the semi finals and final.
First round proper.
36 of the 40 clubs from the First and Second divisions joined the 12 clubs who came through the qualifying rounds. Four sides, Stockport County, Lincoln City, Huddersfield Town and Gainsborough Trinity were entered instead at the Fourth Qualifying Round. Huddersfield lost to Lincoln City in that round, Stockport County lost to Rochdale, while Lincoln City themselves lost to Stoke in the fifth qualifying round. Gainsborough and eleven other non-league clubs won through to the First Round Proper.
Sixteen non-league sides were given byes to the First Round to bring the total number of teams up to 64. These were:
32 matches were scheduled to be played on Saturday, 14 January 1911. Four matches were drawn and went to replays in the following midweek fixture.
Second Round Proper.
The sixteen Second Round matches were played on Saturday, 4 February 1911. Four matches were drawn, with the replays taking place in the following midweek fixture.
Third round proper.
The eight Third Round matches were scheduled for Saturday, 25 February 1911. There were no replays.
Fourth round proper.
The four Fourth Round matches were scheduled for Saturday, 11 March 1911. There were no replays.
Semi-Finals.
The semi-final matches were played on Saturday, 25 March 1911. Both matches were 3–0 wins, to Newcastle United and Bradford City won, going on to meet each other in the final.
Final.
The Final was the 40th FA Cup final. It was contested by Bradford City and Newcastle United. The first game resulted in a goalless draw at Crystal Palace. A single goal scored by Jimmy Speirs for Bradford won the replay at Old Trafford.

Pedro Opeka

Pedro Pablo Opeka (born June 29, 1948), known also as Father Opeka, is a Catholic priest from Argentina, working as a missionary in Madagascar. He exemplifies a new type of missionary: not someone committed to converting and preaching, but someone fully dedicated to the poor, helping them to build their future, with help of Slovenian people. For his service to the poor, he was awarded the Legion of Honor.
Early life.
Opeka was born in Argentina, in San Martín, a suburb of Buenos Aires, to Argentine Slovene parents. His father was from Begunje near Cerknica in Inner Carniola, his mother from Velike Lašče in Lower Carniola;. His father was a former Home Guard Slovenian anti-communist German-led auxiliary police force member and avoided post-war summary executions by fleeing to Italy. He met future Pedro Opeka's mother, also a post-war refugee, in a refugee camp in Italy, where they married. After marriage, they emigrated together to Argentina to avoid the Yugoslav communist regime.
Pedro grew up in the streets of Buenos Aires. Very early as a child, from the age of 9, he worked with his father as a bricklayer. At 15, he hesitated between becoming a football professional and a priest. And he eventually decided to become a priest and enter the seminary of the Lazarists in Buenos Aires. 
At 20, he went to Ljubljana in Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia), to further his training. Two years later, In 1970, he went to Madagascar where he worked as a bricklayer in the parishes of the Lazarists.
He finished his studies at the Catholic Institute of Paris (1972-1975), where he learnt French. He met the Taizé Community near Cluny in France, who have their members supporting communities in 24 major cities around the globe, and travelled all over Europe.
Pedro Opeka speaks 7 languages: Spanish (his first language), Slovenian (his mother tongue), English, French, Italian, Latin and Malagasy (Madagascar).
Mission in Madagascar.
On 28 September 1975, Pedro Opeka was ordained priest in Buenos Aires and was nominated responsible of a rural parish in southeast Madagascar, Vangaindrano.
In 1989, his Lazarist superiors nominated him director of a seminary in Antananarivo, the capital. 
But when he saw the dump from the hills of the city, he discovered people rummaging among garbage to find something to eat and sleeping in huts made of hemp propped between mountains of waste. 
Pedro Opeka began talking to them, to convince them that they could leave that misery and abuse, for their children. With the team of young people he had trained from Vangaindrano, he wrote after long discussions the articles and statuses of Akamasoa ('good friends' in the local language)in December 1989.
Father Pedro simply had no money and started it all with €900 he borrowed from various Christian missions.
Creation of Akamasoa.
Father Pedro Opeka created a local non-governmental organization called "Akamasoa" (the good and faithful friends) in December 1989 to continue his work with the Malagasy people. He appointed a team of staff helping him to manage the daily activities and to provide continuous support to poor people.
Today "Akamasoa" sustains about thirty thousand people in 18 villages, ten thousand children in these villages, who all go to school, following the building of 37 new schools along these years.
About four thousand families live in the 18 villages, but another 900,000 Malagasy people have been supported for one day to three weeks in the 'welcome centers', being offered rice, a cover, some cloth and a small package to be 'born again' to life..
Son to a courageous father who taught him building arts, Father Pedro Opeka taught the Akamasoa youth how to build houses, first in wood, then in bricks and mortar.
Over 3,000 solid houses have been built by Akamasoa to date for people who used to live on the earth in card-board boxes...
Akamasoa is building each year new schools, clinics, and centres for training and production. 
Over 3,600 jobs have been created for the villagers and are being paid by Akamasoa each month.
A comprehensive economic structure, Akamasoa has grown to being 75% self-sufficient in revenue, thanks to the creation of stone and gravel quarries, to the craft and embroidery workshops, to a compost centre next to the 'Tana' public rubbish.
Father Pedro Opeka taught Akamasoa people tips on how to divide and sort the rubbish, to transport the compost issued from rubbish to creating agriculture small farms.
Akamasoa is also training construction artisans (bricklayers, carpenters, cabinet makers, operators and street pavers)who have built or rebuilt roads and bridges to help communities all over the villages and the country...
"Akamasoa" lies about 12 km from the center of Antananarivo, in the road in the direction of Tamatave.
Awards.
In 2007, Opeka was named a knight of the Legion of Honor. The award, decreed on 12 October by the President of France, recognizes his 20 years of public service of the poor in Antananarivo. This award recognizes the ongoing fight led here against poverty by this man of faith and his 412 co-workers: physicians, midwives, teachers, engineers, technicians, and social workers, all of them from Madagascar.
In 2009 Opeka received the Golden Order for Services, which is the highest national decoration of Slovenia.
In 2012 Opeka was nominated for Nobel Peace Prize by united Slovenian European Parliament representatives regardless of political party. In 2013, MEP Lojze Peterle once again started with the nomination process for Opeka; the nomination was supported by Roman Jakič, then Slovenian MP (PS), and also by Janez Janša, then Slovenian PM, and the Slovenian Bishop's Conference.

Erela Golan (, born 1945) is a former Israeli politician who served as a member of the Knesset for Shinui and the Secular Faction between 2003 and 2006.
Biography.
Born in Petah Tikva, Golan gained a BA in theatre and an MA in biology, specialising in neurophysiology. She also studied preservation of construction heritage at Tel Aviv University, and later worked as an architect.
In 1980 she joined Shinui. For the 2003 elections she was placed 16th on the party's list. Although the party won only 15 seats, as the next candidate on the list, Golan entered the Knesset on 16 December 2004 as a replacement for the deceased Yehudit Naot. During her first term, she was a member of the Internal Affairs and Environment Committee, the Education, Culture, and Sports Committee, the Committee on the Status of Women, the Committee on Drug Abuse and the Science and Technology Committee.
Along with most of the party's MKs, she defected to the Secular Faction (which later became Hetz) shortly before the 2006 elections following disagreements over the results of Shinui's primary results. She was placed seventh on the Hetz list for the elections, but lost her seat when the party failed to cross the electoral threshold. 
She later joined Meli Polishook-Bloch's Derekh Aheret movement, of which she was the deputy leader, before leaving to join Efraim Sneh's Yisrael Hazaka party in early 2008.

Morning banana diet

The Morning Banana Diet is a weight loss diet. It was popular in Japan in 2008, causing shortages of bananas in food stores. Niigata University School of Medicine Professor Masahiko Okada
described it to be a fad diet due to lack of nutrient balance.
The diet plan allows consumption of unlimited bananas as they want with room temperature water or a serving of milk for breakfast. Lunch, and dinner food choices are unrestricted. They can have one or more bananas as a snack between meals, but no other desserts are permitted. Nothing is eaten after 8 pm, and the dieter must go to bed by midnight.
Creation and promulgation.
The diet was created by Osaka pharmacist Sumiko Watanabe, for her husband Hitoshi Watanabe, who lost 37 pounds (16.8 kg) in weight. He popularized the diet when he wrote about it on Mixi, one of Japan's largest social networking services. Over 730,000 "Morning Banana Diet" books have been sold since March.
Rules.
http://morningbanana.com/morning-banana-diet-rules
Scientific explanation.
Possible problems with the diet include the misuse of the unregulated lunch and dinner. "Whenever you have a diet that says eat all you want, there's the possibility that people who are prone to overeating will have problems" reports the American Dietetic Association. 
Bananas are an excellent source of dietary fiber, both soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. The six grams of fiber in a two banana breakfast can reduce caloric intake in two ways. Fiber bulks up in the stomach, lengthening feelings of fullness, and pulls some calories through the digestive system before they can be absorbed. Resistant starch, one of the fibers found in bananas, ferments in the digestive tract, creating by-products that increase fat-burning by 20%-25%. Increased resistant starch consumption can increase fat burning and decrease fat accumulation.
Effects on banana market in Japan.
The diet caused bananas to become scarce in Japan for a short period, with retailers unable to meet the demand.

Thirteen of the First Division's twenty clubs were defeated by lower division opposition; this figure remains a record number for a single season. Three of the four semi finalists were from outside the elite division and the cup itself was won by a second tier club.
Calendar.
The format of the FA Cup for the season had a preliminary round, five qualifying rounds, four proper rounds, and the semi finals and final.
First round proper.
36 of the 40 clubs from the First and Second divisions joined the 12 clubs who came through the qualifying rounds. Of the League sides not exempt to this round, Oldham Athletic, Glossop and Chesterfield were put into the Fifth Qualifying Round, and each one won. Clapton Orient were placed in the Preliminary Round, and won through to the Third Qualifying Round before losing to Southend United. Nine non-league clubs joined the three League sides in winning through to the First Round Proper.

The four quarter final matches were scheduled for Saturday 7 March 1908. The Everton against Southampton game was drawn, and replayed on 11 March.
Semi-Finals.
The semi-final matches were played on Saturday 28 March 1908. Newcastle United won their tie against Fulham 6–0, which remains a record for an FA Cup semi-final. In the other tie, Wolverhampton Wanderers won against Southampton to meet Newcastle in the final.
Final.
The Final was contested by Wolverhampton Wanderers and Newcastle United at Crystal Palace. Newcastle had just finished 4th in the First Division during this season, after two successive league titles and this was their third FA Cup final appearance in 4 years (although they had yet to win). Their 6–0 thrashing of Fulham in the semi-final is a record win for a semi final. By contrast, Wolves had finished 9th in the Second Division.
Nevertheless, Wolves upset the odds by winning the match 3–1, with goals by Kenneth Hunt, George Hedley and Billy Harrison. James Howey scored the Magpies' reply. The Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Bell, then handed the trophy to Wolves' captain, Billy Wooldridge.

Shocker Toys

Shocker Toys was a company that manufactured limited release toys and collectible products based on comic book and cartoon characters, as well as original creations. Founded in 1998, the company was run by Geoff Beckett Jr. and Lance Buttiglieri, and was based in Ridgewood, New Jersey.
In 2012 Beckett rebranded the company as GBJR Toys and began raising money for the company through fundraising sites. It has since come under fire for allegedly using licenses without permission and failing to deliver product as promised. Beckett, however, has claimed that GBJR toys is in no way associated with Shocker Toys.
History.
Shocker Toys was founded in 1998 in Buffalo, New York by Geoff Beckett Jr. Beckett had previously worked in construction and claims he was inspired to venture into the toy industry while "playing games with his brother". The company operated primarily on the Internet, and by 2002 the company had two full time employees: CEO Beckett and Marketing Director Dana Newsom.
Shocker Toys relocated twice prior to 2002, moving to Glen Rock, New Jersey in 2000 before relocating to Ridgewood, New Jersey. During this early period, the company's primary focus was on card games featuring characters developed by Beckett. However, these card games were never brought to market. Instead, the company began to focus on developing action figures, and in 2004 they released their first product: the Shockini block figure. According to Shocker Toys, this was a significant year for the company, as it was also the year in which Shocker Toys was incorporated and Beckett was joined by Lance Buttiglieri as a new partner. Subsequent to Buttiglieri joining the company, Shocker Toys continued to develop the Shockinis line, and in 2006 displayed the figures at the American International Toy Fair.
While Shocker Toys became "best known for being plagued by delays and other problems", the company released the first series of Indie Spotlight figures and the "Mallow" line of marshmallow-themed figures in 2009. In January 2010, Dave Ryan was named Shocker Toys' first sales agent.
In May 2011, Shocker Toys was accused of nonpayment for work done for them by artist Tony Robles and then attempted to have the artist's website shut down by Robles' domain host using legal threats. During the Shocker Toys panel at the 2011 Comic-Con International: San Diego, court papers were served to Geoff Beckett by Jim MacQuarrie on behalf of Robles.
In late 2011, Shocker Toys announced that the company had new partners and that they had undergone a change in ownership. One of the new owners of Shocker Toys is Eric Nyenhuis, the current owner of GLOW (Gorgeous Ladies Of Wrestling). Packaging mock-ups of GLOW action figures bearing the Shocker Toys logo have been shown online.
During the first half of 2012, Geoff Beckett rebranded the company as GBJRToys, through which he now holds the licenses to make Indie Spotlight and Mallow figures.
Products.
Shockinis.
Debuting in 2004, Shockinis were the company's first product to be released. Shockinis were 3 inch action figures intended for customization, with multiple points of articulation. Geoff Beckett has stated that while there are many similar toy lines – including Kubricks, Pocket Heroes, and MiniMates – Shockinis, and their predecessor, Stikfas, are the only two designed specifically for customization. Beckett has differentiated Shockinis from Stikfas on the basis that Shockinis were "conceived in the USA" and were available as preassembled figures rather than as model kits. Different versions of Shockinis, including a Toxic Avenger Shockini, Kade from Arcana comics and other comic book convention exclusives were sold online, at conventions, and through a few comic book shops in limited runs of 50 to 1000 pieces. No new Shockinis have been produced since 2006.
Indie Spotlight.
In 2006, Shocker Toys started work on Indie Spotlight, a line of six-inch action figures based on characters from various independent comic book series. The first series consisted of Katchoo from Terry Moore's "Strangers in Paradise", Scud and Sol from Rob Schrab's "", the Maxx from Sam Kieth's series of the same name, David Mack's "Kabuki" and two different versions of Jim Valentino's "Shadowhawk". A small figurine of an Isz was included with each figure, as well as other, character specific accessories. Plans to include a comic book or poster packed in with each figure, similar to the packaging of Toybiz's Marvel Legends figures, were announced but later abandoned. Shocker Toys also announced a "mail away" figure of Mr. Gone from The Maxx, available to customers who purchase all seven figures in the first series. This figure has yet to be made available, however a sculpt did appear at the 2010 Toy Fair.
Development of the Indie Spotlight series encountered several problems, among them Marvel Toys' 2007 release of their own line of action figures including independent comic book characters announced for the Shocker Toys line. Prototypes of Indie Spotlight Series 1 were displayed at the 2007 American International Toy Fair, and new versions of that series were shown at the following year's show and at the San Diego Comic-Con – the latter also including Series 2 prototypes. Following numerous announced (and subsequently missed) release dates, the first series of Indie Spotlight action figures was available for purchase online as of April 2009.
In February, 2011, a limited run, preview edition of The Tick from the planned second series of Indie Spotlight figures was released, along with a "Mucus Tick" variant produced as an exclusive for the "Idle Hands" website.
Limited convention exclusives.
Shocker Toys has produced a number of convention exclusives over the years. These include a Gwar "Beefcake" statue, a 3" Maxx vinyl figurine for the San Diego Comic-Con, and a statue for the New York Comic Con. Shocker Toys also released a pair of statues and a box set of five vinyl figures based on the fictional band Dethklok from the Adult Swim series Metalocalypse as San Diego Comic-Con exclusives. The box sets of vinyl figures were limited to 500 pieces and sold at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, the subsequent 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, and the 2009 Wizard World Chicago Comic Con.
At the 2009 New York Comic Con, Shocker Toys had planned to sell two translucent versions of their then-forthcoming Scud and Maxx figures from the Indie Spotlight line. The figures were unavailable for the event, but were shipped out to customers roughly a month later, starting on March 3, 2009. A similar variant was offered at the Wizard World convention in Philadelphia that year, with a transparent Maxx incorporating painted highlights. At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, Shocker Toys offered figures based on their forthcoming Indie Spotlight Series 2 – a "black and white" Dick Tracy figure and a trench-coated variant. At the same event, convention exclusive Mallows also debuted, including Dr. Rockso, the Phantom, and an SDCC Guy.
Convention exclusives have also been sold through their website, and unsold figures have subsequently been made available at later conventions.
Mallows.
In 2009, Shocker Toys started a new line of marshmallow themed figures called "Mallows." Similar to Hasbro's Mighty Muggs and Kidrobot's Munny and Dunny figures, Mallows feature multiple points of articulation, interchangeable parts, and are available in blank, black or white, do-it-yourself versions.
Cancelled or unreleased items.
Card games.
Shocker Toys first planned products were card games featuring characters developed by Beckett. Despite promoting them online, none of the card games were brought to market. Beckett cited cost fixing by competitors as the cause.
Manga.
Using characters from the unreleased card games, the company turned its attention to developing an "American Manga magazine". The magazine was never published, but the characters developed for the stories lead to the company's next effort.
Shoulder Action Figures.
After its attempts at manga creation and publication, the company changed direction to focus on the production of action figures. In 2002 Shocker Toys displayed prototypes of their Shoulder Action Figures, or SAFs, at the "Christmas in July" event in New York run by public relations firm Steven Style Group. In spite of early publicity for the concept, the product was never released, with Beckett citing problems arising from outsourcing as the cause. The company's attention then shifted to developing the Shockini line of action figures.
Mutant Mania Shockinis.
Shocker Toys announced a line of "mutant and monster" Shockinis in October 2004, for release the following February. Aside from a Toxic Avenger Shockini which was released as a convention exclusive, no other figure from the line was released.
Other Licensed Shockinis.
Shockinis based on characters from Bucky O'Hare, Gwar, "2000AD" (including Judge Dredd), Metalocalypse, the Indie Spotlight line, and Who Wants to be a Superhero? were announced as early as 2005. Other than the Toxic Avenger and Kade from Arcana comics, no other licensed properties were produced as Shockinis.
Gwar.
Shocker Toys acquired the license to produce toys based on the band Gwar, releasing a 500 piece run, resin statue of the band member Beefcake as a San Diego Comic-Con exclusive in 2006. However, the announced line of articulated PVC Gwar action figures was canceled before reaching the market. The proposed replacement line of vinyl Gwar figures was never released.
Metalocalypse.
In 2007, Shocker Toys acquired a license to the characters in the fictional band Dethklok from the Adult Swim series Metalocalypse. The announced regular retail line of Metalocalypse figures was never released, although San Diego Comic-Con exclusives were sold in 2008 and again in 2009, including Dr. Rockzo as a Mallow designer figure in a limited run of 500 pieces. An expansion of the Metalocalypse line was announced December 23, 2009. On January 12, 2010, it was announced that Adult Swim discontinued the Metalocalypse license with Shocker Toys.
Who Wants to Be a Superhero?
Shocker Toys also licensed the characters from the reality television series Who Wants to Be a Superhero?, including Feedback, the winner of the first season in 2006, with the well publicized, though unrealized, aim of producing action figures based on the property.
Indie Spotlight Series 1 Mail Away Figure.
The Mr. Gone mail away figure, an incentive for customers who bought all of the first series of Indie Spotlight figures released in 2009, was never released.
Indie Spotlight Series 2.
A second series of Indie Spotlight figures was announced at Toy Fair in February 2009 and then displayed at San Diego Comic Con in July 2009. The line was announced to be available in August 2009, with a lineup of King Zombie, Dick Tracy, Ignacia, Jack Staff and The Tick. The official release date was pushed back to Q4 2009 and then again to Q1 2010. The figures were never released.
Indie Spotlight Series 3.
A third series of Indie Spotlight figures was announced at Toy Fair in February 2010. These figures were never released.
Other Spotlight lines.
In April 2008, the expansion of the Indie Spotlight line was announced to include Horror Spotlight, Anime Spotlight, Manga Spotlight, Movie Spotlight, and Gamer Spotlight. Illustrations depicting the proposed Anime Spotlight designs were displayed at the 2011 New York Toy Fair. Further announced Indie Spotlight lines from February 2010 include Golden Age Spotlight series 1 and Indie Spotlight Two Packs. These figures were never released.
2010 Summer Convention Exclusives.
Shocker Toys sold four convention exclusive Indie Spotlight figures during the 2010 Summer Convention season: Barry Hubris, The Blank, the Blue Beetle and Hunter Rose. The figures were not released.
DMC SDCC Exclusive Figure and Comic.
At the 2011 New York Toy Fair, Shocker Toys announced an exclusive figure and comic book based on DMC of Run DMC. Neither figure nor comic book were released due to a dispute.
American Greetings Licensed Mallows.
Licensed Mallow offerings announced, though never released, include Madballs, My Pet Monster, and Sushi Pack figures.
Indieverse Comics.
In 2010, Shocker Toys announced the Indieverse line of comics, intended to create a crossover universe for participating independent comics titles. No comics were ever released.

Dover Immigration Removal Centre

Dover Immigration Removal Centre (formerly known as Dover Prison) is an immigration detention centre, located in the historic citadel of the Western Heights fortifications in Dover, England. The centre is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. Dover has been designated as an historic site by English Heritage.
History.
The Western Heights of Dover are one of the most impressive fortifications in Britain. They comprise a series of forts, strong points and ditches, designed to protect the country from invasion. They were created to augment the existing defences and protect the key port of Dover from both seaward and landward attack. There have been fortifications here since Roman times, but fortifications built for defense from the French in the days of Napoleon house the buildings there today.
The Prison Service took over the site from the British Army in 1952 when work began on converting the fortress into a prison. In 1957, the prison was converted into a Borstal, also operating as a Young Offenders Institution until April 2002, when Detention Centre Rules 2001 converted it into an Immigration Removal Centre.
The centre today.
Hosting male adult detainees aged 18 and over who are appealing for asylum or have failed in seeking it, Dover offers residential space with integral sanitation as well as resources such as televisions and telephones. It provides shared resources including gym, a library, church, mosques, multi-faith rooms, shops, laundry facilities, and a healthcare unit

2009 Wigan Warriors season

This article is about the 2009 season of the Wigan Warriors in the European Super League and Challenge Cup.
Background.
Following Brian Noble's move from the Bradford Bulls to the Wigan Warriors in 2006, his third full season at the club took place in 2009. The season was also the first in which the Super League operated under a franchise system, after the Wigan Warriors were granted a 'B' license. The salary cap, which the club broke in 2007, was still in effect for this season, and the limit remained at GBP£1.7 million; the cap was maintained 'live', in continuation of an operational change by the Rugby Football League in 2008. As an ever-present club in the Super League format, this season was the Wigan Warriors' fourteenth year in the competition. This year also marked the tenth anniversary of rugby league at the JJB Stadium, after the club moved there upon the stadium's completion in 1999.
In contrast to the club's historical success, Wigan Warriors had not won a major trophy since 2002, when they defeated St Helens RLFC 12–21 in the Challenge Cup final. They had only won the Super League title once, in 1998. In the previous season the Wigan Warriors finished fourth in the league table meaning they qualified for the play-offs, and after defeating Bradford Bulls and Catalans Dragons, the club fell short of the 2008 Super League Grand Final after losing to Leeds Rhinos at Headingley for the second year running.
Pre-season.
Following their knock-out at the hands of Leeds, the task of acquiring new players began. 2008 was influential stand-off Trent Barrett's last season for the Warriors, after he signed for the Cronulla Sharks for the 2009 National Rugby League (NRL) season; Barrett himself insisted that Tim Smith could replace him, after Smith was released by Parramatta Eels following an episode of bipolar disorder. It was also to be the last season for Liam Colbon and Mark Calderwood, who both transferred away from the club. An attempt to sign the Canberra Raiders' Todd Carney ended after Huddersfield Giants signed him instead. The club prevented a possible cross-code transfer with George Carmont to rugby union by extending his contract. Wigan eventually signed their first new player with former Sydney Roosters player Amos Roberts, who was released from his contract a year prematurely, but lost another player to the Warrington Wolves in Mickey Higham. Joel Tomkins, a Wigan Warriors Youth Development product, also extended his contract until the end of the 2011 season. Rumours about a move for Ryan McGoldrick ended after he publicly ruled out any possible transfer. The question over Barrett's successor in the stand-off position was again raised when Tim Smith, who was on holiday in his native Australia at the time, approached the Cronulla Sharks seeking a return to the NRL, although the club did not pursue any deal with Smith and he therefore stayed at Wigan for the 2009 season. Greg Bird, who had been suspended by Cronulla Sharks for an alleged assault on his girlfriend was also cited by The Independent as a target for the Warriors, but any plans of a transfer were initially denied by the club's chairman, Ian Lenagan. On 30 January 2009, Lenagan confirmed it was unlikely there would be any more signings for the new season, having acquired two new players (Amos Roberts and Mark Riddell), after attempts to sign Richard Moore from Wakefield Trinity Wildcats failed.
The 2008 Rugby League World Cup was held in Australia during the off-season, and several Wigan players from the 2008 season were involved in matches concerning their own international teams. Pat Richards, Eamon O'Carroll and Michael McIlorum were called by the Irish team, with Paul Prescott missing out due to a back injury. Carmont and Harrison Hansen were selected for the Samoan national team. Stuart Fielden was omitted from the England squad but Calderwood, Higham and Gareth Hock all received places. Thomas Leuluai became the only Super League player from the 2008 season to win the World Cup when the New Zealand team he played hooker for defeated the Australian team 20–34 in the final.
Wigan played three friendly matches after the World Cup, the first being a 4–44 victory over Warrington Wolves at the Halliwell Jones Stadium during the traditional festive season, in which Riddell and Karl Pryce both made their first-team debuts. The Warriors played in a changed pink and black-hooped jersey in support of a local hospice, as Sam Tomkins completed a twenty minute hat-trick, Richard Mathers and Pryce scored a double each, and Shaun Ainscough and Joel Tomkins also picked up one try apiece. The next match against Huddersfield Giants proved to be more difficult, as Carmont scored a last-minute try to hand Wigan a narrow victory at the Galpharm Stadium, with Riddell scoring two tries and Fielden being sin-binned in the first half. On the official opening on the new Leigh Sports Village and a week before the new Super League season began, the Warriors whitewashed their local rivals Leigh Centurions by 0–32 with a squad in which both new signings, Roberts and Riddell, were left out of.
Season review.
February.
Wigan's season began on 8 February with a home defeat to a depleted Wakefield Trinity Wildcats side which only had seventeen players to fill their squad with due to injuries, and the death of Adam Watene during the off-season. Head coach Brian Noble blamed the result on a poor completion rate of 40%. Wakefield took an early lead after Dave Halley crossed the line in the first minute, before scoring again via the same player in the fourteenth minute to make a 0–12 initiative, following two successful conversions by Tony Martin. Joel Tomkins was introduced into the game in the second half as he scored a try which was converted by Pat Richards, but Wigan failed to score again. Richard Mathers, who was sent-off twice in 2008, was put into the sin-bin by the referee, Richard Silverwood, for the deliberate obstruction of Halley, and match ended in the first defeat for Wigan in their 2009 campaign.
Prior to their next match, the Warriors announced a partnership with the University of Central Lancashire, as part of an effort to promote rugby league in the Preston area, in exchange for the student team at the university displaying the Wigan Warriors logo. This news was announced in the same day Mathers learned he would miss the next two matches for tripping Halley, including the club's next match against Hull which they lost at the KC Stadium. Hull FC started strongly, but Wigan scored first off a Tim Smith kick to Goulding and Phelps which eventually resulted in a try for Bailey. Richard Horne scored for Hull to level the scores at 6–6 before a last resort intervention from Kirk Yeaman denied Goulding a try. The scores were therefore level at half-time, and a kick from Smith resulted in another try for Richards who bettered his opposite winger, Mark Calderwood in the air. With four key players missing—Riddell, Phelps, Bailey and Richards—due to injury, Wigan tired in the final quarter allowing Chris Thorman and Peter Cusack to score late in the game to put the tie beyond the visiting team.
With Mathers suspended and Cameron Phelps injured with a hamstring injury and two other injury concerns, Karl Pryce and Shaun Ainscough were given places in the initial 19-man squad to take on Castleford Tigers. A third defeat out of three matches came as Castleford won a ten try game 22–28, a result which meant Wigan's worst start to a season in twenty-four years. With Richards still missing due to injury, conversions proved to be the difference as both teams scored five tries apiece, but kickers Roberts and Riddell could only manage one successful kick whilst the Tigers' kicker Kirk Dixon managed four. Two disallowed Castleford tries in the first ten minutes were followed by two penalty goals by Dixon to give Castleford a 0–4 lead. Thomas Leuluai's effort gave Wigan a try before Joe Westerman put the Tigers ahead again after 34 minutes. Castleford scored again through Brett Ferres, with Dixon converting to give Castleford a 6–16 lead at half-time. Wigan scored first after the break thanks to a try from Karl Pryce, but this was unconverted and Castleford replied with two more of their own with Dixon and Ferres scoring his second try. Wigan started a fight back, initially through a Goulding try, and then again through Joel Tomkins. Ainscough marked his debut with a fifty-yard try to reduce the deficit to two points, but Michael Shenton's try sealed the victory for Castleford. Michael McIlorum was also cited and suspended by the Rugby Football League after the game for a dangerous throw on Mitchell Sargent. After failing to gain a point from the first three matches in the season, Noble's position as head coach was strengthened when Ian Lenagan publicly supported him, stating, "Brian is a very experienced coach and I'm sure we'll get this right. He has had bad starts to the season before, and he has good starts."
Wigan recorded their first win of the season with a 18–24 victory over Harlequins Rugby League at the Twickenham Stoop in London. Ainscough scored his first of two tries after a break from Roberts down the wing, and it was converted by Richards who was playing at fullback as a replacement for Mathers who was omitted from the squad. Chad Randall punished Joel Tomkins' handling error for Harlequins' first try before Matt Gafa scored another try for the home side to make the half-time score 10–6. On his Super League debut, Sam Tomkins—Joel's younger brother—was involved in the build-up to Carmont's try after the second half had begun, and Bailey scored another try to put Wigan 10–14 ahead following two missed conversion attempts. A disallowed try for a knock-on by Will Sharp was followed by a knock-on from Carmont, before a 40-20 gave Louis McCarthy-Scarsbrook a chance to score a try in the 64th minute. Chris Melling restored a four-point lead for the home side with ten minutes left in the game after Harrison Hansen knocked-on. In the 75th minute, Randall's pass was intercepted by Roberts for an easy intercept try which Richards converted to give a two-point lead, which was increased to six as Ainscough scored the final try of the game.
March.
The start of March was also the start of the reserve team's season, which begin with a comfortable win against Bradford Bulls. Richards scored twenty points including eight goals and a try as the first team earned their first home victory of the season, winning by a margin of thirty-four points. Richards scored the first of seven Wigan tries after nine minutes, before Hock broke the defensive line to put Wigan 12–0 ahead. Another line break from Hock provided an offload to Carmont who scored a third try. A twenty-point gap emerged as Richards kicked a penalty conceded by Paul Sykes, before Bradford scored their first of two tries through Rikki Sheriffe after 48 minutes. Hock replied by scoring his second try, before a line break by Riddell handed a try to Harrison Hansen. Wayne Godwin broke his leg after stopping an Iafeta Palea'aesina run, before Palea'aesina himself scored Wigan's final try. Steve Menzies scored his first Bradford try before the match ended.
Wigan's run of victories was short-lived as they lost the away tie to Leeds Rhinos immediately after. An unchanged Wigan side from the tie against Bradford could only score two tries, conceding six the other way. The victory was the Rhinos' fifth out of five matches, and they were ahead after three minutes thanks to a 40-20 which was converted into a try by Kylie Leuluai. An error from Ainscough proved costly as Scott Donald scored from the resulting turnover. Upon the half-hour mark, Leeds were 22–0 ahead after Rob Burrow touched down under the sticks and another 40-20 provided a try, this time for Ryan Hall. Ainscough scored Wigan's first try following a pass from Thomas Leuluai, before Wigan were disallowed another try after the video referee Phil Bentham ruled Sean O'Loughlin had obstructed Burrow. Hall scored his second, besting Roberts in the air, after fifty minutes. Peacock scored Leeds' sixth try, bursting through the defensive line, whilst Hock scored the last try of the game.
An away tie to Salford City Reds was more favourable for Wigan as they eased to victory at The Willows. Salford had the first major chance of the game as a kick from the 18-year old Richie Myler was knocked-on by Jeremy Smith. Carmont replied, catching an offload from former-Salford player Andy Coley, to hand a try to Ainscough. Myler again created an opportunity, but Karl Fitzpatrick was pushed into touch. A break via Ainscough and Riddell gave Leuluai a try, before Myler scored Salford's first try following a kick from Jeremy Smith. Sam Tomkins saw a hole in the defensive line and ran through it, scoring Wigan's third try, before Richards scored a fourth to make the half-time score 22–6. Wigan scored first again in the second half as Sam Tomkins scored from the half-way line, before Ainscough scored his second. Myler and Jeremy Smith again combined for the former's second try, this time from a pass, but Richards sealed the game for Wigan after offloading to Leuluai for his second and Wigan's seventh try. The win was dampened by the injury of Ireland international Eamon O'Carroll, who fractured his metatarsal bone during the reserve game against Salford.
In a game that was 8–10 going into the final ten minutes, and had three players sent to the sin-bin, Wigan lost their third home game. Amos Roberts returned after being dropped to the reserves the week before, whilst the visiting Huddersfield team contained five former Wigan players. Brett Hodgson gave Huddersfield the initiative by kicking a penalty for a 0–2 lead, and Hock almost responded but knocked-on in the act of scoring a try. Bailey eventually scored a try for Wigan, but Richards failed to convert, and the score was made level after another kicked penalty from Brett Hodgson. Scott Moore gave Huddersfield the lead again after a run from dummy half to give a 4–10 lead, despite a take-out on Leuluai just before half-time which went unpenalised. Luke Robinson was sin-binned for delaying play and Roberts almost made the advantage count, but grounded the ball in touch and the try was disallowed. Darrell Griffin and Hansen were then sin-binned for a fight, before passing along the backs lead to a Roberts try, but Richards again failed to convert. Ainscough then fumbled a kick from Robinson, and Michael Lawrence punished the mistake by scoring a try for Huddersfield. Brown scored minutes later to put the game beyond Wigan.
April.
The fourth round of the 2009 Challenge Cup occupied the first weekend of April, and for all Super League clubs this meant their first Challenge Cup ties. In March, Wigan learned that they would face an away tie to the Barrow Raiders, and it was expected this match would be held in front of the first sell-out crowd at Barrow's Craven Park for twenty-five years. The game itself was still in the balance fiftenn minutes from time, with Barrow trailing Wigan by four points at 20–24, following a match which had seen a Shaun Ainscough hat-trick and Wigan's defensive frailties exploited again. The result pivoted on a forward pass decision which ruled out another Barrow try, minutes before Pryce scored a controversial try for Wigan in which he appeared to have knocked-on, with twelve minutes left to play. A try from Tomkins eventually sealed the win for Wigan to advance them into the fifth round of the competition.
On the day after, it was confirmed Martin Gleeson would transfer to Wigan from the Warrington Wolves, on a three and a half year contract. The signing came after Warrington had left Gleeson out of the squad which defeated York City Knights in their fourth round Cup tie, meaning Gleeson would be eligible to play for Wigan in future Cup games. Wigan were reported by the Wigan Evening Post to have spent GB£110,000 and given Richie Mathers in return for Gleeson. On the day after Gleeson's signing was announced, the draw for the Challenge Cup's fifth round took place. Wigan received an away tie to Wakefield Trinity Wildcats.
Gleeson featured in the first derby match of the year against St Helens RLFC. Ainscough put the home Wigan side ahead after nine minutes with a try on the wing, following a kick from Leuluai. Richards missed the conversion, and so Wigan only went four points ahead before St Helens replied with a try of their own through Keiron Cunningham, with Paul Wellens making the conversion. Hock had a try disallowed for a double movement, and later on a high tackle on Paleaaesina gave Roberts an opportunity to level the scores, with which he succeeded to draw the score at 6–6 at half time. Ainscough again carved out a lead for Wigan in the second half, and Roberts converted from the sideline. Two quick St Helens tries through Matt Gidley and Leon Pryce gave the visitors a 12–18 lead, and a Kyle Eastmond drop goal sealed the match for them.
Prior to their next match, Barrow Raiders confirmed that they had signed Lee Mossop on a month-long loan.
Despite providing a close fight against St Helens, the club's visit to Perpignan for their away tie against Catalans Dragons ended in its third consecutive loss. The Dragons scored first through Dimitri Pelo's try in the second minute. Wigan scored fourteen points in return, with three tries from Roberts, Ainscough and Gleeson and one conversion for a 4–14 lead. A ten-point lead proved precarious as Catalans ran in thirty-six unanswered points, the first of them coming through a Greg Bird try. Grégory Mounis scored next, and Thomas Bosc kicked the conversion to give the home side the lead, and Jason Ryles gained another try before half-time. The Catalans fullback Clint Greenshields scored first after the break and also scored the next try. Ryles also scored a second try of his own to open a twenty-six point deficit. Tomkins and Richards gave Wigan two late tries, but the match by then was all but finished.
Similarly to Mossop, Darrell Goulding completed a transfer to Salford City Reds on a month-long loan deal. After an extension to this deal in May, Goulding was to be eventually recalled on 7 July to cope with an injury crisis.
The club's next match was against newly promoted Crusaders, who had not won a match yet in the Super League season coming into this fixture. Celtic led after two minutes, when Luke Dyer pounced for a try after Phelps mistakenly let the ball bounce into the in-goal area. Richards replied with a try on the wing, before O'Loughlin gathered his own kick for a solo try to present a lead to the home Wigan side. Two more tries came for Wigan before half-time with Riddell and Roberts both scoring one each. Sam Tomkins scored not long after the break thanks to a run from Palea'asesina. Carmont stretched the lead further with a try of his own, and O'Loughlin scored his second try of the match. Damien Quinn was sin-binned in his 100th competitive appearance for the Crusaders—Marshall Chalk was also sin-binned later on. Richards claimed his second try almost instantly after Quinn's dismissal. Mark Dalle Cort scored a late Celtic try and captain Jace Van Dijk successfully converted, but Wigan had another try before the game ended, with Sam Tomkins grounding his second try of the match—his team's ninth—to complete a convincing victory for the home side.
Transfer news occupied the break between this win and the Warriors' second league match against Wakefield Trinity Wildcats. The Wigan Evening Post reported that the club, as well as Leeds Rhinos, were interested in signing Richie Myler from Salford City Reds, although neither club were successful in their approaches to the player. Warrington Wolves would eventually sign Myler later in the year. Meanwhile, Thomas Leuluai extended his contract with the club for a further three years.
George Carmont had to be replaced at short notice prior to kick-off against the club's next opponents, Wakefield Trinity Wildcats. Shaun Ainscough was recalled to take his place in the team, and scored four tries to give his side a second consecutive win. Wakefield, like Celtic, put the first points on the scoreboard after Damien Blanch received a kick from Danny Brough for a try on the wing, with Brough converting for a 6–0 lead. Tim Smith linked with Cameron Phelps, who was switched from fullback to center in Carmont's absence, for Wigan's first try. Phelps turned provider as his work gave Ainscough two tries in nine minutes for a 6–16 lead, before Wigan's indiscipline gave Brough a penalty and a try following a handling error from the stand-in fullback, Pat Richards. Ainscough scored again on the wing to complete his hat-trick, but Wakefield replied after Brough intercepted a pass from Martin Gleeson and returned 45 metres for his second try to make the scores 20–22 at half time. Wakefield took the lead shortly after the break as Blanch took advantage of Ainscough's weak defence for his second try. This was Wakefield's last try of the match, as Phelps gathered a kick from Smith to score a try next to the posts which Richards converted successfully. Riddell was injured with a hamstring, and despite Wakefield pressure, Wigan scored again as a run from Sam Tomkins led to another try for Ainscough—his sixteenth in ten matches. Gleeson scored in the final ten minutes to put the game beyond the home side's reach.
May.
Ahead of their 2009 Magic Weekend fixture against St Helens RLFC, Thomas Leuluai learned that he would not be called up to play in the 2009 ANZAC Test, news which was welcomed by Brian Noble, who stated that New Zealand had, "enough southern hemisphere-based Kiwis to cope." Leuluai instead took membership of a Wigan side which recorded its third successive league win at Murrayfield Stadium over a St Helens RLFC side including James Graham, who had complained earlier in the week about the event's location being too far away. Wigan had lost to St Helens at the Magic Weekend event in 2007 and 2008, 34–18 and 57–16 respectively, but it was Wigan's captain Sean O'Loughlin who scored the game's first try after seven minutes. Pat Richards scored the match's second try following a kick from O'Loughlin, and added both conversions to give Wigan a 12–0 lead. This was further extended after Gareth Hock scored after 29 minutes. Sean Long gained a try back for St Helens as his grubber kick rebounded off Leuluai, before a break from Sam Tomkins fed his older brother Joel for a try just before half time. Two minutes after the break, Wigan kicked a penalty to stretch the lead to 26–6, and Wigan ended any hope of a St Helens comeback as Leuluai scored following a break down the wing from Richards. St Helens scored the next two tries through Leon Pryce and Paul Wellens, with Long kicking both conversions, but Richards scored his second try and kicked the conversion to take his personal haul to twenty-two, and end the match 38–18. With Noble's contract due to expire at the end of the season, Ian Lenagan praised him for Wigan's biggest derby win in six years over St Helens, but refused to offer any assurances about Noble's future at the club, after Bradford Bulls refuted a claim that they wanted to replace Steve McNamara with Noble.
For the next match, the players again returned to Belle Vue, two weeks after their league win. The Wakefield Trinity Wildcats were coached by John Kear, twice a winner of the Cup as a head coach, most recently in 2005 with Hull, and in 1998 when his Sheffield Eagles side defeated Wigan 17–8 in the final, three years after Wigan's last of a record eight consecutive Challenge Cup final victories. The match did not start in Wigan's favour, as Danny Brough provided passes to Jason Demetriou and Tevita Leo-Latu, and kicked a conversion to give the Wildcats a 10–0 lead. Wigan went in ahead at half time though. Wigan got their first points with a try on the wing from Richards, and then another try from Michael McIlorum following a Gareth Hock pass. Brough kicked a drop-goal to give Wakefield a point lead, but Cameron Phelps scored a third Wigan try after Sean O'Loughlin broke the line from his own half. Wakefield went ahead for the third time twelve minutes after the break, with a grubber kick from Brough being gathered by Tony Martin. Stuart Fielden then scored his first try in two years before Sam Tomkins finished the game with a try of his own making. The fourth goal of the match meant the final scores were 17–28; a win for Wigan which advanced them to the quarter-finals. The day after, the draw for the next round to be played three weeks later was made, with Wigan receiving a home tie against Salford City Reds.
Following a run of four games, the club's next match was against Hull Kingston Rovers. Their preparations were boosted by news that Sam Tomkins would not receive a match ban for his conduct against Wakefield in the Challenge Cup tie. Goulding extended his loan spell at Salford City Reds, but with a condition that Wigan could recall him with 24 hours notice. The match seemed to be heading towards a 6–0 lead for Wigan at half-time, after Sean O'Loughlin scored a try and Richards kicked a goal, but a controversial try scored by Michael Dobson after the hooter had sounded was awarded by the referee, Richard Silverwood. Incensed, Wigan started the second half with another converted try from the captain, O'Loughlin, but this was to be their final score of the match. Paul Cooke collected his own kick for a solo try, and Jake Webster put Hull KR into the lead, with Dobson kicking both goals for a six-point advantage. A late penalty was kicked by Dobson for another two ponts, concluding the match in favour of Hull KR. The match ended Wigan's run of four victories, and placed Hull KR temporarily at the top of the Super League XIV table.
Following his loan spell at Barrow, Lee Mossop transferred to Huddersfield Giants on a month-long loan. Prior to Wigan's next match against Warrington Wolves, Noble, whose contract at Wigan was due to expire at the end of 2009, publicly admitted that he was becoming impatient with the lack of an offer from the club to extend his contract, after reports in the Sydney Morning Herald linked him to a coaching role at Sydney Roosters. Wigan had not won a game in Warrington since 2003, and despite leading for over half the match, failed to break this record. Warrington successfully charged down two kicks, before a kick from Thomas Leuluai on the third set of six tackles lead to Cameron Phelps scoring the match's opening try. Poor discipline from Ben Westwood gave a penalty, and Wigan almost took advantage when Joel Tomkins was held up over the try-line in the act of scoring by former Wigan full-back, Richie Mathers. Wigan again launched the next attack after forcing a goal line drop out, but a try from Amos Roberts was disallowed because of a knock-on by Pat Richards. Warrington then applied a sustained twenty minute period of pressure, but errors from Westwood and Briers kept them off the scoresheet. Briers weighted his next kick better, with Matt King out-jumping Shaun Ainscough to score Warrington's first try. Bridge's missed conversion meant that Wigan lead 6–4 at half-time, and a penalty kicked by Richards early in the second half meant that this lead was increased by two points. Warrington gained the lead after 55 minutes after Chris Riley punished Stuart Fielden and Andy Coley for giving away successive penalties with a try in the corner. Michael Monaghan shimmied past three Wigan defenders to finish the game off with another Warrington try.
Tim Smith had been left out of the tie against Warrington owing to a family illness, and did not return from his home country, Australia, in time for Wigan's Challenge Cup tie against Salford City Reds, but George Carmont returned from injury. Fielden was also forced to miss the game, after receiving a one-match ban for raising a knee in a tackle during the defeat to Warrington. Without Smith and Fielden, Wigan comprehensively beat Salford City Reds 28–6 to advance to the semi-finals stage of the tournament. Gareth Hock gave the home side the lead, before Salford equalised with a try from Luke Adamson. Wigan replied by taking the lead with a George Carmont try, and could have scored again after Hock broke the line, but Sam Tomkins knocked-on. Another knock-on, this time from Richards, denied Wigan another try. Salford launched repeated attacks on the Wigan line early in the second half, through Mark Henry and Stefan Ratchford, before Willie Talau was pushed into touch by Sam Tomkins. A penalty from Richards added two more points to Wigan's total, and he soon scored his second try, followed by his third on 70 minutes for his second hat-trick in a Wigan jersey. Hock scored the final try, his second, after Tomkins had come close, to finish the game in favour of the Warriors. Wigan therefore entered their first Challenge Cup semi-final since 2007, when they were defeated by Catalans Dragons at the Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington, and it was Warrington Wolves who were drawn as their 2009 semi-final opponents.

1905–06 FA Cup

The FA Cup 1905–06 was the 35th staging of the world's oldest association football competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (more usually known as the FA Cup). Everton won the competition for the first time, beating Newcastle United 1–0 in the final at Crystal Palace.
Matches were scheduled to be played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played, a replay would take place at the stadium of the second-named team later the same week. If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held at neutral venues until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.
The Crystal Palace versus Chelsea tie in the third qualifying round led to the Football Association changing the rules. The tie was scheduled to be played on 18 November 1905, and Chelsea were also obliged to play a Football League game against Burnley F.C.. Chelsea were chasing promotion from the Second Division, and so they fielded a full strength side in the league and sent a reserve team to Palace. Palace won the fixture 7-1 in front of a crowd of 3,000. As a result of the outcry, the Football Association amended their rules such that teams must always field their strongest side in the FA Cup.
Calendar.
The format of the FA Cup for the season had a preliminary round, four qualifying rounds, four proper rounds, and the semi finals and final.
First round proper.
29 of the 40 clubs from the First and Second divisions joined the 24 clubs who came through the qualifying rounds. Of the League sides not given byes to this round, Chelsea, Hull City, Leeds City and Clapton Orient were entered at the First Qualifying Round. Chelsea and Leeds City went out in the Third Qualifying Round (to Crystal Palace and Hull City respectively), while the other two teams qualified. Barnsley, Bradford City, Burslem Port Vale, Burton United, Gainsborough Trinity, Glossop and Stockport County were put into the Fourth Qualifying Round, with only Glossop going out, to Brighton & Hove Albion. Sixteen non-league clubs joined the eight League sides in winning through to the First Round Proper.
To replace the missing League teams, eleven Southern League sides were given byes to the First Round to bring the total number of teams up to 64. These were:
32 matches were scheduled to be played on Saturday, 13 January 1906. Six matches were drawn and went to replays in the following midweek fixture, of which one went to a second replay the following week.
Second Round Proper.
The sixteen second round matches were played on Saturday, 3 February 1906. Six matches were drawn, with the replays taking place in the following midweek fixture. One of these, the Brighton & Hove Albion – Middlesbrough match, went to a second replay the following week.

Ralph Clanton

Ralph Clanton (September 11, 1914 – December 29, 2002) was an American character actor. Although his name is not familiar to audiences, he did play a significant supporting role in a classic film which is revived regularly. His most often seen performance is as the Comte De Guiche in the 1950 film "Cyrano de Bergerac", the first sound version in English of Edmond Rostand's classic play, and the film for which José Ferrer won his only Academy Award for Best Actor. Besides Ferrer as Cyrano, Clanton was the only holdover from the cast of the 1946 Broadway revival of the play, and would play the role of De Guiche opposite him once more, in a New York City Center production in 1953.
In addition to playing De Guiche in "Cyrano", Clanton was featured in seven different episodes of Alfred Hitchcock's television show, as well as making several appearances on the Hallmark Hall of Fame. In 1976, he played the role of George Washington in a PBS television production of Sidney Kingsley's "The Patriots", a drama that had itself been produced on the "Hallmark Hall of Fame" in 1963, but without Clanton. He also played the role of Jasper Delaney on the TV soap operas, "Another World" and its spinoff, "Somerset".
He played the role of Mr. Ingram in the sci-fi thriller "The 27th Day".
He played guest star roles on numerous television series, such as four episodes of "Perry Mason", including the role of Mervyn Aldritch in the premiere episode, "The Case of the Restless Redhead" in 1957, and murder victim Charles Brewster in "The Case of the Fancy Figures" in 1958. In addition, he appeared on Broadway in the role of Claude Nau in Robert Bolt's "Vivat! Vivat Regina!", as well as in several Shakespeare productions. One of his last roles was a bit part in the hit Dan Aykroyd - Eddie Murphy film "Trading Places", in 1983.
In a playbill for the 1946 revival of "Cyrano de Bergerac" he is listed as a direct descendant of members of the infamous Clanton gang, which took part in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

French overseas orders

By a decree of 1 September 1950, the Fifth French Republic set up two French overseas orders of knighthood (French:"Ordre de la France d' Outre-mer"):
These two orders were leftovers from the French colonial empire in which distinctions in colonies such as Dahomey or Comores were recorded in the French system of orders. Decolonisation and re-structuring of the French empire also necessitated changes in its system of orders. 
Three other former colonial orders were added in 1896, as "orders of states associated with France" :
In 1963 the provision of all overseas orders was stopped, and they were replaced by the Ordre national du Mérite.

Papilio thoas

The King Swallowtail or Thoas Swallowtail ("Papilio thoas") is a butterfly of the family Papilionidae. It is found in the southernmost United States, Mexico, Central America and South America (as far south as Argentina and Uruguay). The species is easily confused with the Giant Swallowtail, which it closely resembles in both larval and adult stages. Thoas caterpillars, however, feed on plants of the black pepper family, Piperaceae, while giant swallowtail larvae eat the leaves of citrus plants Rutaceae.
Adult Thoas swallowtails fly year round in the tropics, feeding on nectar of a variety of flowers, including "Lantana", "Stachytarpheta", and "Bougainvillea" among other species. The wingspan is 100–130 mm.

Prussian S 6

The Prussian S 6 (later DRG Class 13.10–12) was a class of German steam locomotive with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement operated by the Prussian state railways for express train services.
Development.
After the Prussian steam locomotive classes S 4 and S 5 proved less than fully satisfactory, there was a requirement in Prussia for faster and more powerful express locomotives. To that end the Head of the Locomotive Design and Procurement Department, Robert Garbe, proposed to the Locomotive Committee in 1904 a design by Linke-Hofmann of Breslau for a 4-4-0 superheated, express train locomotive. This was an evolutionary development of the Prussian Class S 4 that also had a 4-4-0 configuration.
In putting this forward, Garbe was especially keen to prove the superiority of his design compared with the four-cylinder, wet steam, compound locomotives, particularly its predecessor, the Prussian Class S 7.
In 1905/1906 Garbe pushed through the construction of the S 6. Between 1906 and 1913 a total of 584 units were manufactured by Linke-Hofmann, Henschel-Werke and the Maschinenbauanstalt Humboldt in Cologne. They were the last four-coupled, express locomotives to be built in Germany and, for a long time, were the most economical locomotives in the Prussian state railways.
Design features.
The design initially caused major difficulties, because it had to keep to the maximum permitted axle load for the railway network of .
This limitation led to the weight savings in many areas. At first, the plate frame was made of thick material; this later had to be changed to the usual . On the first few engines, a smokebox superheater was installed, but the design this was changed during the first year in favour of a Schmidt smoke tube superheater. The long boiler was located well forward in order to spread the weight to the front carrying wheels and to keep the axle load within the maximum limits, thus giving the engine the typical appearance of a "Garbe locomotive".
The driving wheels of the S6 had the rather unusual diameter of in order to keep the rpm down and to guarantee the smooth running of the driving gear. Originally a diameter of had been planned, but in the end it was reduced by . The heavy balancing masses of the driving gear were badly affected by weight savings. That resulted in serious jerkiness when running. A remedy was achieved by coupling the tender closer to the locomotive and thus raising the compression of the buffer springs.
Not until the lines were upgraded in 1910 to take a axle load, could the necessary reinforcing measures be taken. The S 6 then became the heaviest 4-4-0 locomotive on continental Europe, even outweighing the subsequently built four-cylinder, saturated steam locomotives of Class S 7.
The driver's cab was initially built with a tapered front and conical smokebox doors in order to reduce wind resistance. An unfortunate side effect of the streamlined driver's cab, however, was that the engine crew were dazzled at night by reflexions from the diagonally oriented front window panes. From 1908/1909 the cab was built with a flat front.
The locomotives were equipped with Prussian Class pr 2’2’ T 21.5 tenders.
Performance.
The S 6 achieved its highest indicated power of 1,160 PS () at a speed of . On the level it could haul a train of (the equivalent of 13 eight-wheeled D-Zug coaches) at a continuous speed of . On engines with a feedwater preheater the performance was about 10% higher.
Distribution.
Apart from the divisions of Berlin and Königsberg (other sources also name Saarbrücken), the S 6 was procured by all the Prussian railway divisions S 6. There were only a few transfers.
After the First World War the S 6 was employed in express train duties (on the Leipzig–Dresden, Berlin–Dresden and other lines) as well as in passenger train services. Many of the engines were rehomed at Dresden.
Preserved locomotives.
From 1912 the S 6 was ousted from heavy express train services by the S 10.
In the 1923 DRG renumbering plan for steam locomotives, 442 S 6 engines were listed for renumbering into the 13 1001 to 13 1442 series. In the third and final renumbering plan only 286 engines were listed: numbers 13 1001 to 13 1286.
The last engines in Germany were retired between 1926 and 1931.
After World War I, 81 S 6s were handed over to Poland, 42 to Belgium, two to Italy and one to Lithuania as reparations.
The engines in those countries survived considerably longer in service; in Belgium they were not retired until 1956.
During the Second World War a total of 56 S 6 came back into the Reichsbahn fleet from Poland as numbers 13 501-556.
One S 6 has been preserved in Warsaw (Poland).

St. Philip's Priory

St. Philip's Priory situated on New London Road in Chelmsford, Essex, UK is a Premonstratensian priory of canons regular. It is dedicated to Our Lady Queen of Martyrs and St. Philip Benizi. 
The site was formerly a private house, but was brought by Mr. Henry Shepperd in 1927 for the purpose of installing a community of Servite nuns. The priory and its chapel was solemnly blessed and opened on 15 September 1927, the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows, by Bishop Doubleday (Bishop of Brentwood 1920–51). The Servites ran the priory and an adjoining school until the 1990s when the house was purchased by the diocese for use as a presbytery for the nearby parish of Our Lady Immaculate. The Premonstratensian community, which had originally been founded in 2004 in Manchester, established their home at the priory in October 2008 at the request of Bishop Thomas McMahon of Brentwood.
The Premonstratensians serve the parish of Our Lady Immaculate on New London Road, together with that of Holy Name, in the Moulsham Lodge area of Chelmsford. The canons also function in other roles, such as in academia and chaplaincy work. The priory is also a centre of the Archconfraternity of the Mass of Reparation.
Before the Reformation the Premonstratensians had a house at Beeleigh Abbey in Maldon and owned land throughout Essex, including in the Moulsham area where St. Philip's Priory now stands.

Copeland Report

The Copeland Report was the result of a United States Congressional investigation of forestry for the purpose of outlining a coordinated plan that would "insure all of the economic and social benefits which can and should be derived from productive forests by fully utilizing the forest land." The investigation was called for by Senator Royal S. Copeland of New York in Senate Resolution 175 (72d Congress, 1st sess., 1932) 
Earle Clapp, later Chief Forester of the US Forest Service, supervised the report. 
The report was finished in April 1933 and was a two-volume, 1,677-page document titled "A National Plan for American Forestry" which described and evaluated all aspects of forestry from timber, water, range and wildlife to recreation, state aid and fire protection. This report became the blueprint for forestry in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and had its beginnings in a senatorial discussion of unemployment, where reforestation might be a source for jobs. Previous reports had given the state of the forests, but without offering a plan for improvement.
In the Copeland Report the main recommendations were: (1) A large extension of public ownership of forest lands, and (2) more intensive management on all forest lands.

Mendeleev Russian University of Chemistry and Technology

D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia has its roots going far back into the 19th century. Back then, professors from the Imperial Moscow Technical School (currently, Bauman Moscow State Technical University) came up with an idea of establishing an Industrial College in Moscow to train “Chemical and Mechanical Engineer Assistants”.
This proposal received an enormous support on behalf of the Moscow City Duma on February 9, 1880, which passed a Decision to Build an Industrial College in Moscow to Commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Russian Emperor Alexander II's Reign.
Industrial College.
The college foundation was laid on Miusskaya Square in Moscow on May 23, 1898. The classes began on July 1 in leased premises, and the first class was out of school in 1906.
Moscow Industrial College had a strong faculty, many of whom had been professionally trained at the Imperial Moscow Technical School and Moscow State University. This fact predetermined the dynamic development of the new educational institution, which was transformed into the Moscow Chemical Technical College in 1918, and began to churn out applied engineers.
Mendeleev Institute.
In 1920, Moscow Chemical Technical College was used as a basis to establish Moscow D. Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology (MCTI), which became the first specialised chemical technical school establishment in Russia to train professionals for the chemical and related industries, and made a hefty contribution in the industrial development and defense potential, especially during World War II.
It was named after the great Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleev, the discoverer of the Periodic law, the establishment of which established scientific foundation for world's most further chemical research.
Mendeleev University.
In 1992, the Decree by the Russian Government transformed Moscow D. Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology into D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia.
Influence.
Moscow D. Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology became the forebear of a number of renowned higher educational institutions in the USSR, and other countries. MCTI/MUCTR takes pride in its famous scientists and founders of new research areas, such as Academicians N. Vorozhtsov, N. Zhavoronkov, V. Korshak, B. Zhukov, V. Koptyug, V. Legasov, V. Kafarov, famed process engineers N. Yushkevich, V. Yung, G. Petrov, A. Bakayev, senior officials within Russia's higher education system, including S. Kaftanov and G. Yagodin, the USSR Minister of Culture Pyotr Demichev, and many others.
Achievements.
The glorious cohort of the disciples carries on the cause of their teachers. MCTI/MUCTR graduates have effectively dealt with the challenges facing the USSR and Russia, including the defense issues.
This school is unlike others in terms of the fundamental nature and wide range of training provided to its students, multiple forms of the training process, and blending of the academic and research activities within the University. Currently, MUCTR is among the leaders of Russia's technical universities, and enjoys the highest rating among Russia's chemical technology schools. The University has gained the international recognition as a leading educational and research centre providing training for highly skilled professionals. MUCTR owes much of its success for over the past 20 years to Academician P. Sarkisov, Rector and current President of the University.
During nearly 130 years of existence, the University went through a lot of trials and tribulations alongside the Russian science and industry, including the painful period of World War II, and the post-war reconstruction of Russian economy. The faculty and staff of D. Mendeleyev University dealt enthusiastically with the issues of the nuclear energy use, cybernetics development, and conservation of the environment. Today, too, the University researchers continue their studies in the cutting-edge areas of the chemical science, and achieve outstanding results in bringing solutions to the problems of the fundamental science and applied research.

The video then moves to a bar scene before Rouvas jumps from the highest diving board of a pool, and impresses the woman. Scenes of the two spending time together are seen next. When the woman falls asleep, Rouvas steals a large diamond from her safe causing a brief police chase which he escapes from. The video ends with Rouvas joining three women on a speedboat and dropping the diamond into the ocean.

His act was notable for its juggling of the comedic style and may be described as helping define the so-called "tramp" juggling style epitomized by W. C. Fields. In fact, Sato and Fields are known from Fields' surviving correspondence to have maintained a bantering relationship in which the two traded gossip and ideas for their acts.
Sato was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He began his career at Coney Island and met his wife, Marguerite Wartenburg, while touring in Europe. They were married in 1896.
After Sato retired from the stage he was a real estate developer in Irvington, N.J., where he died suddenly of a heart attack on Wednesday, March 23, 1921.

Ronald Reid's Three Topoi

Reid's Three Topoi provide a basic framework for understanding pro-war rhetoric and propaganda. (1) Territorial appeals, (2) ethnocentric appeals, and (3) appeals to optimism characterize pro-war rhetoric. Reid also defines a fourth appeal, war aims. However, because this fourth aim supports the other topoi, it is often not identified as a separate category. Due to these appeals, “American presidents have been able to impart a positive value to nation’s wars as well as justify the nation’s involvement." By understanding the persuasiveness of these appeals, Reid believes one can better understand wartime behavior.
Biography.
Ronald F. Reid, a Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst at Amherst, retired in 1991 after 32 years of teaching. Reid received a bachelor’s from Pepperdine, a master’s from University of New Mexico, and a Ph.D. from Purdue.
Territorial appeals.
Territorial appeals “taps into the ‘lower’ instincts we share with the animal kingdom." As most animal species “mark off units of physical space” as “theirs” and will fight to retain that space, “many countries, led by the U.S., have developed a global sense of territoriality.” As a result, nations “regard physical space as property” and are prepared to defend that property. The object of the territorial appeal is gain support for war by convincing the audience that the country is in danger. Countries are more willing to support war when they feel their land is threatened. Just as “a defending animal’s willingness to fight correlates with the extent to which its territory is invaded,” a human's willingness to fight correlates with the extent to which his country is threatened.
Expansionism.
Territorial appeals are often used to portray “expansionism as defensive by depicting it as a response to an existing outside threat or honorable effort to recover territory” that was unfairly taken. Thus, through territorial appeal, “even unjustified American imperialism…can be characterized as defensive.” 
Encroachment appeals.
Encroachment appeals are reminiscent of the domino theory. By “narrating recent ‘encroachments’ along the frontier,” the orator proposes these seemingly isolated attacks are part of a bigger takeover conspiracy.
Metaphysical appeals.
There are some ideas/virtues countries assume as property. “A populace may be motivated to embark upon a course of war because of the threat posed to its national ideals by a competing ideology." Therefore, an orator can demonstrate a metaphysical territorial appeal by showing a threat to these ideals.
Ethnocentric appeals.
The Ethnocentric Appeal states that if the individuals in a culture belong and identify to it, they are likely to think their culture is superior to other cultures. Ordinary ethnocentricity tends to lead those of a culture to ignore "outsiders." The Ethnocentric Appeal concentrates on creating an ‘Us vs. Them’ mentality. According to ethnocentricity, individuals often see their culture as superior to others. Therefore, when an orator is able to “establish a ‘realistic’ image of the enemy’s savagery,” he “eliminate peace as a viable alternative to war." For example, during the American Revolution, the government told the people "God's plan of history called for progress, and the Revolution was an integral part of that plan." This sets up the notion that "they" were "evil" and we are "good" because God is on our side.
Emotional intensity.
Pro-war rhetoric must "arouse ethnocentrism to a high level of emotional intensity." To achieve this:
Appeals to optimism.
An Appeal to Optimism creates the illusion war is not bad and that it has its positives. This can be achieved in four ways:
Appeals to war aims.
War Aims support former appeals and provide an ending goal for the war. Missions “rhetorically create the sense of an objective response." Nations want to bring about more peace and security. For example, the war aims for security protect from future territorial threats of enemies. Permanent peace will ensure security. If “the aim is total overthrow of the enemy,” the language is ambiguous, unclear, and utopian. For example, “We seek to create a massive change." If the “aims reflects a desire for security,” the language expresses clear anticipated results. Presidents will “define an issue the possible resolutions to that issue."

Al Este

Al Este Bodega y Viñedos is a winery in Médanos, Buenos Aires, Argentina. It consists of vineyards (in owned lands that exceed ) and an adjacent winery, located south of the city of Buenos Aires on the southern tip of the Buenos Aires province. The project has been developed under the direction of the Italian wine maker Alberto Antonini.
In its first submission to a wine contest, Al Este was awarded a Silver Medal in the White Wine category in the 2009 Decanter World Wine Awards, the world's largest wine contest, celebrated in London. Al Este's award-winning wine is recommended by Decanter in sixth position as one of the top chardonnays in 2009.
History.
In the early 1900s several European immigrants arrived to Médanos and brought the wine making tradition with them. Although at some point a multitude of small growers planted a combined surface of approximately 200 hectares of vineyards, they were unable to successfully complete the wine making process given lack of scale, inadequate technology and the country’s ups and downs which lead to their disappearance.
The Médanos terroir, that had traditionally been dedicated to garlic and pastures, has striking similarities to Bordeaux, France in terms of its soil, weather conditions and proximity to the sea. More recently, the idea of starting a wine project in Médanos got reignited as a result of a trip to France which provided renewed confidence in the terroir’s potential.
In 2000, a hectare and a half was planted on an experimental basis with nine grape varietals. In a second stage, after analyzing the obtained quality standards for each grape variety at the Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria (INTA), 25 additional hectares were planted mainly with six varietals.
Grape varieties.
Al Este produces several varietals.
Red: Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tannat, Cabernet Franc
White: Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc

The vineyards are located at 39 degrees latitude south, where the Patagonia and Pampa converge, approximately 40 km from the Atlantic Ocean. Windy springs help develop thicker skins that contribute to the intense color of these wines. 
The geological foundation of the Médanos region is limestone, leading to a soil structure that is heavy in calcium. The soil has high sand content, which doesn’t retain as much humidity, and as a consequence this terroir absorbs and liberates heat faster creating a large temperature range which favors the development and growth of grapes.
Topography: Flatland with meadows (médanos)
Soil type: Sandy over a calcareous plate
Irrigation system: Dripping
Frost protection: Water spraying by aspersion 
Harvesting and grape selection: Manual
Plant support system: Espalier
The winery produces red and white wines, which are aged in French and American oak and in bottles in its underground cellars. It is the first company to grow, produce and sell premium wines in the Buenos Aires Province.
Domaine Al Este.
Domaine Al Este is a 290 hectares terroir located in Médanos, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Developed by Al Este, it was the result of a careful analysis and screening of land in this new terroir that was particularly apt for the growth of vineyards dedicated to the production of premium wines. 
The vineyards are located at 39 degrees latitude south, where the Patagonia and Pampa converge, approximately 40 km from the Atlantic Ocean.
Topography: Flatland with meadows (médanos)
Soil type: Sandy over a calcareous plate
Weather: Oceanic influence, with a windy Spring
Rainfall: 500mm per year

Ralph I, Lord of Coucy

Ralph of Coucy, (c. 1134 – † 1191), lord of Coucy, lord of Marle, La Fère, Crécy (sur-Serre), Vervins, Pinon, Landouzy (la-Ville), and Fontaine (lès-Vervins). He was the son of Enguerrand II, Lord of Coucy. He left for the Holy Land, where he died in the siege of Acre in November 1191.
History.
Coucy, finding himself a widower and desiring a male child, married for the second time with Alix II of Dreux, a royal princess who was a relative by his mother, Agnès de Beaugency, daughter of Mahaut (or Maud or Matilda) de Vermandois, eldest daughter of Hugh I, Count of Vermandois called the Great, brother of King Philip I of France. Alix II of Dreux was the daughter of Robert I, Count of Dreux, grandson of King Philip I, and King Louis VII of France's niece. Alix de Dreux II's mother was Agnès de Baudement, Countess of Braine, third wife of her father Robert I de Dreux, and her brother was Robert II, Count of Dreux (d. December 28, 1218), Count of Dreux and Braine, who was married to Yolande de Coucy, eldest daughter of our Raoul, and Agnès of Hainaut, his first wife. By his two marriages, Raoul became stepfather to a great prince, son-in-law to a son of France, and cousin to Philip Augustus. Raoul attended the King of France in 1181 during the war against Philip I, Count of Flanders, although previously he had received the land of Marle and Vervins in the fief of La Ferte-Beliard that the Count had given him as an homage. But by the peace treaty granted afterward the king ordered that the Count should take this tribute back. The same Raoul became liege of the king for the estates of the fief of La Fère, which had been previously held by the church of Laon.
Legend.
It is said that before his last breath, Raoul had instructed his squire that after his death, he should take his heart to the woman he loved (which some call the Lady of Fayel and others Gabrielle de Vergy). The squire was surprised by the husband when he was fulfilling his mission. The husband took the heart and forced his wife to eat it. She, who learned too late about her misfortune, swore never to eat food again and let herself die of hunger. This incident provided Pierre Laurent de Belloy the subject of his tragedy of Gabrielle de Vergy.

Ballet Arizona

Ballet Arizona is a professional ballet company in Phoenix, Arizona directed by Ib Andersen. The company was created in 1986 by a merger of three smaller Arizonan dance companies that were struggling to survive. Today, the company of thirty-six dancers occupies a prominent place in American ballet.
History.
Allen Rosenberg, a Phoenix philanthropist and arts supporter, orchestrated in 1986 a fusion of the Phoenix Ballet, Arizona Dance Theater, and Ballet West Arizona, all of which were in difficulties due to a lack of funding and audience. The company was originally directed by Jean-Paul Comelin, formerly with Milwaukee Ballet and Stuttgart Ballet, and New Zealand dancer Malcolm Burn. Burn left soon thereafter, and the company was guided through its early success by Comelin until 1992, when Michael Uthoff became artistic director. During the 1990s the company continued to grow, until it was beset with financial trouble in 1999. In September 2000, Ballet Arizona narrowly escaped shutting down due to severe debts, and was resurrected at the last moment by a wild funding campaign. Ib Andersen was named artistic director in May 2000, and has held that position ever since. Andersen reshaped the company and greatly expanded their repertory, adding a number of works by George Balanchine as well as pieces of his own choreography. In 2004, Kevin Myers was appointed Management Consultant to head the administrative division, and one year later the company eliminated its debt.
Performances.
Ballet Arizona has a wide repertory of works by well-known choreographers such as Balanchine, Christopher Wheeldon, and Twyla Tharp. Artistic Director Andersen also choreographs his own works for the company, and has reinterpreted many classical ballets including Coppélia, Romeo and Juliet, Swan Lake, and The Nutcracker. In October and November 2008, the company presented Andersen's new version of A Midsummer Night's Dream.
The company performs regularly at Phoenix Symphony Hall and the Orpheum Theatre. "Pre-Performance Chats" are offered before all performances except "The Nutcracker". Each performing season is kicked off with a series of free, outdoor performances known as "Ballet Under the Stars". The company has an active volunteer organization known as the "Esprit de Corps," which provides a number of services including hosting the company's annual Nutcracker Party.
Company.
Ballet Arizona as of August 2011.
School.
The School of Ballet Arizona is the academy affiliated with the company. The school teaches dance to over 100 students, which consist of ages 3 all the way to adulthood. The school gained its first full-time director, Kee-Juan Han, in 1993. Then, Nancy Crowley became the director from 2000 to 2010. Now, the school is directed by Carlos Válcarcel who joined the school in 2011, and the artistic director is Ib Andersen. Students of the academy perform in an annual spring performance and "The Nutcracker". The school is also involved with the Arizona School for the Arts through after-school programs and performances.

Line 6 (Naples Metro)

Line 6 (Italian: "Linea sei") is a light metro line that forms part of the Naples Metro. It connects 4 stations, with a further 4 planned.
History.
The actual Line 6 was originally projected as a rapid tramway line ("Linea Tranviaria Rapida", LTR) with some underground parts. Works started at the end of the 1980s, with a plan to open the first section for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.
As the end station "Mergellina" couldn't be completed in time, the line wasn't opened and was left abandoned for many years.
In the 2000s it was decided to complete the Mergellina station and to open the section that had already been built, but as a light metro without any connection with the tram network. The section was opened on 4 February 2007, from "Mostra" to "Mergellina" with two intermediate stops at "Lala" and "Augusto", and a frequancy of a train every 8 minutes. It is operated by Metronapoli.
As the existing section is really short, and already served by other parallel lines (Line 2 and Cumana), the line has been much less used since its opening. The service was suspended on 10 March 2011, and later re-opened only in the morning from Mondays to Fridays with a reduced frequency.
Projects.
The line will be extended from the West of Naples to the city center at "Municipio".
Preliminary work began in July 2006 on the way to "Municipio", where work is already already under way on Line 1. In September 2007 Ansaldo STS was awarded a €426m contract for the 3.1 km section "Mergellina" - "Municipio".
Service.
Trains travel every 16 minutes, only in the mornings from Mondays to Saturdays.

Windlestone Hall

Windlestone Hall is a 19th-century country house situated near Rushyford, County Durham, England. It is a Listed building.
The Eden family who held the manor of Windlestone in the 17th century were Royalists during the English Civil War and Colonel Robert Eden who had served in the King's army was obliged to compound for the return of his confiscated estate. Following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, his grandson, also Robert Eden, was created a baronet in 1672, (see Eden baronets).
In 1835, the fifth Baronet, Robert Johnson Eden, replaced the 16th-century manor house with a new mansion designed by architect Ignatius Bonomi. The two-storey house presents a twelve-bay balustraded frontage to the east. A balustraded Doric order colonnade extends across nine bays of the ground floor. The north ends in a large apse. A billiard room was attached to the north east in the mid-19th century.
On the death of the fifth Baronet in 1844, the estate and Baronetcy passed to his first cousin once removed, Sir William Eden, who was already the fourth Eden of Maryland Baronet. He was High Sheriff of Durham in 1848.
The house was the birthplace in 1897 of Anthony Eden, who entered parliament as a Conservative Party Member of Parliament in 1923, later serving as a cabinet minister before serving as prime minister from 1955 to 1957. At the time of his death in 1977, he was living in Wiltshire.
The house and estate were used as a prisoner of war camp during World War II, a satellite camp of Harperley POW Camp 93. Between 1957 and 2006, it was occupied by Windlestone Hall School, a local authority residential special school. Since the school closed in 2006. 
Windlestone Hall is now under private ownership.

Richelieu Inc. was a cultured pearl manufacturer in New York City which formed in January 1933. The business was incorporated through the merger of Heller-Deltah Company and Joseph H. Meyer Brothers. The former firm made Deltah, La Tausca, and Bluebird pearls. The latter produced Richelieu pearls. Richelieu Inc., had its offices at 8 West 30th Street in Manhattan. The original company was founded by Joseph H. Meyer & Brothers in Brooklyn, in 1911. Richelieu pearls were popular as an affordable alternative for consumers who were looking for inexpensive yet attractive jewels.
Manufacturing process.
Richelieu pearls were made by Japanese who placed bits of mother of pearl in oysters. The oysters covered the bits of pearl with layers of nacre. The pearls grew to maturity within five to eight years. The pearls are perfect on one side, the lower side being coated with mother of pearl. Their cost was about one tenth the cost of genuine pearls. Richelieu pearls were made by coating an iridescent foundation with a substance obtained from a fish which lived in European rivers. Many coatings were necessary before the jewel was completed.

The Man-Eater

The Man-Eater is a short adventure novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, written in May 1915, originally as a movie treatment. His working title for the piece was "Ben, King of Beasts." "The Man-Eater" is one of Burrough's rarer works. It was first published as a serial in the "New York Evening World" newspaper under the present title from November 15–20, 1915, but did not appear in book form in Burroughs' lifetime. The first book edition was issued by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach's "Fantasy Press" fanzine in 1955; it then appeared in the collection "Beyond Thirty and The Man-Eater", published by Science-Fiction & Fantasy Publications in 1957. It was reprinted in paperback (without the hyphen in the title) as "The Man Eater: Ben, King of Beasts" by Fantasy House in 1974.
Plot.
Jefferson Scott, Jr. and Robert Gordon, hunters in the Belgian Congo, are thrown together with missionaries Sangamon and Mary Morton and their daughter Ruth. Scott marries Ruth, and Gordon is entrusted with stock certificates to be taken back to Scott's father in America. Later Scott and the elder Mortons are killed by the native Wakandas; Ruth and her daughter Virginia are saved by Belgian forces and afterwards return to America to live with Scott's father. The stock certificates, meanwhile, have gone astray, with only a single sheet of paper having been delivered to the elder Scott. Nineteen years pass.
On the death of Jefferson Scott, Sr., Virginia Scott is to inherit the estate, but the will cannot be located, and Scott Taylor, her grandfather’s disinherited nephew, appears to claim a half share. Proposing to Virginia in an effort to obtain it all, he is rebuffed, whereupon he disputes her right to any of the estate, pretending she is illegitimate. Ruth attempts to prove her marriage to Virginia's father by writing to Robert Gordon, who witnessed the ceremony, but he is now deceased. Her appeal reaches his son Dick Gordon instead. Moved but unable to provide the desired proof, Gordon writes back of his intention to sail to Africa to seek documentation of the marriage there. Taylor intercepts the letter and follows him with the intention of murder. Discovering this, Virginia also sets out for Africa.
Gordon reaches the ruins of the old mission and finds there a sealed envelope, with which he begins his trek back to the coast. Taylor and his confederates Kelley and Gootch await him in ambush in a native village. They kill a lioness, whose mate the natives take captive in a pit trap. Virginia arrives at the village and is imprisoned by the villains. Meanwhile, Gordon discovers and frees the captured lion, which then returns to the village seeking the killers of its mate. The lion arrives just as the villains are about to rape and kill Virginia, and kills Gootch while others flee. Virginia escapes but is stalked by a hyena. Gordon, who happens to be nearby, hears her scream and shoots the beast. She warns him against Taylor, who then appears with Kelley, seeking her. Seizing Gordon’s gun, she wounds Taylor and drives the villains off. They return to America and separate, Gordon somehow neglecting to give her the envelope. Meanwhile, the lion has been captured by hunters and sold to an itinerant American circus, in which he is billed as "Ben, King of Beasts, the Man-Eating Lion."
Realizing his omission, Gordon visits the Scott home to deliver the envelope to Virginia and Ruth, unaware that Taylor and Kelley have returned from Africa and still plan to kill him. He finds the Scotts absent from home, their return delayed by a train wreck. Ben, who was also on the train, is freed by the wreck and turns up at the house, where he detects the scents of both his rescuer Gordon and the two villains. Encountering the latter, he kills Kelley and pursues Taylor to Gordons room. There Taylor struggles with Gordon and overcomes him, taking the envelope before fleeing from Ben. The lion follows, overtaking and killing Taylor within sight of the returning Scott's.
Gordon, pursuing Taylor, recognizes Ben and protects him from the armed party that arrives to kill the escaped lion. He buys Ben from the circus, intending to give him a new home in a zoo. The mysterious envelope, finally opened, proves to contain the long lost stocks, not the hoped for marriage certificate. The latter turns up, together with the missing will, in a cupboard in the Scott house, having been secreted there by Jefferson Scott, Sr. The certificate was evidently the paper Gordon's father had delivered to the elder Scott instead of the stocks. Dick Gordon and Virginia Scott declare their love for each other and decide to marry.
