Hexthorpe rail accident

The Hexthorpe rail accident occurred on 16 September 1887 at Hexthorpe railway platform some west of Doncaster on the South Yorkshire Railway line to Sheffield and Barnsley. The platform was situated within a block section between Hexthorpe Junction and Cherry Tree Lane and so had no signals of its own. The railway platform was a simple wooden structure on the Doncaster - bound line usually used for the collection of tickets from the many trains arriving in the town for the St. Leger race meeting.
The usual method of working the section of line was to pass trains from Hexthorpe Junction under a 'permissive' block ruling, not usually used on passenger lines, with additional control by two flagmen spaced between the junction box and the ticket platform. On this day two trains were in the section, the first, a Midland Railway train, stood at the platform, the second, another Midland train waiting just to its rear. As the first train moved off the second moved onto the platform so that tickets could be checked. 
The third train in this scenario was a Liverpool to Hull express worked by a MS&LR crew and probably the crew who should have understood the working of the line better than any other. This train came over Hexthorpe Junction with, first the 'distant' signal and then the 'home' signal at danger. With speed down to a crawl the 'home' signal was lowered, the driver assumed, wrongly, that with no other fixed signals to Cherry Tree Lane his route was clear and speed gradually rose. In the official report it was said that the first of the flagmen gave no indication and the second gave an ambiguous signal which was seen by the fireman but not properly understood. The express was reported doing between 35 and 40 m.p.h. when they rounded the curve and saw the Midland train still in the platform. The driver applied the 'simple' vacuum brake and threw the locomotive into reverse but could not stop with the short distance of less than 250 yards.
The trial of the driver and fireman at York, before the Lord Chief Justice was the first big legal case in which the newly formed trade union A.S.L.E.F. were part and for which they engaged eminent counsel to defend their members. The jury returned a verdict of 'not guilty' and the Lord Chief Justice said in his summing up that "...he could not but think that the railway company was seriously to blame for having had in use a brake which not only was not the best in existence, but which was known to be insufficient and liable to break down". The management were "thick skinned" over all safety matters and in this case Sir Edward Watkin, the company chairman, said "...it was a misfortune that the Lord Chief Justice should have exonerated the driver and fireman". Regardless of Sir Edward's thinking the Hexthorpe accident, closely followed by the Armagh rail disaster in Northern Ireland sounded the death knell of the 'simple' vacuum brake.

Where There Is No Doctor

Where There Is No Doctor: A village health care handbook is the most widely used health education book in tropical and sub-tropical developing countries. Based on David Werner's experiences at his Project Piaxtla in western Mexico, it was originally written in 1970 in Spanish as "Donde No Hay Doctor". It has since been revised multiple times, has sold over one million copies and been translated into over 100 languages. The book is available for purchase, in either book form or on CD, at Hesperian's bookstore. Because the non-profit publisher's mission is making health information readily accessible to everyone, portions can also be download free-of-charge in pdf format.
Its distribution is worldwide. The US Peace Corps has distributed it in The Gambia. In Uzbekistan, a United States Agency for International Development grant enabled a team under Dr. Donald Elsworth and Robert Graves of Central Asian Free Exchange to translate the book into Uzbek.
In 2012 Hesperian Health Guides launched their "Digital Commons", and health manuals, including Where There Is No Doctor can now be downloaded in 26 different languages, including Arabic, Filipino, Khmer, Lao, Portuguese, Spanish, and Urdu. The Commons also makes available images from the book, and the "Health Materials Workshop" enables people to make flyers and posters based upon it. The New Where There Is No Doctor is currently in development as an entirely new book. This project takes on the health demands of the 21st century, with entirely new information on diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDs, first aid, and various other topics.
Content.
The book covers all aspects of people's health ranging from diarrhoea to malaria and bone fractures and ringworm. Special emphasis is placed on hygiene, a healthy diet and vaccinations, and the book explains to readers what they can do themselves and how to prevent, recognise and treat many common sicknesses. It also shows them how to recognise problems they are unable to cope with and need to refer to a health worker. This new revised edition includes information about some additional health problems such as AIDS, dengue fever, complications from abortion, drug addiction and covers in detail both childbirth and family planning.
Reception.
In the "British Medical Journal", a 1998 review said:Chances are that if you visited a remote district hospital in a developing country you would find a well thumbed copy of Where There Is No Doctor in its library. The book is intended primarily for village health workers, but generations of doctors and medical missionaries who have worked in under-resourced communities globally will vouch for its value in providing concise reliable information.
The book was referenced in a 2004 article in The Lancet, entitled "Can we achieve health information for all by 2015?". Underlining the importance of straightforward information in the language of the reader, the authors wrote that:A community health worker may find a single copy of "Where There is No Doctor", adapted and written in the local language, more useful than access to thousands of international journals.
In the "Journal of the American Medical Association", a 2010 review said:it is still not known if the book effectively improves health. [However,] In most of the world, where physicians are not available and diseases are rampant, the status quo is unacceptable. Until better solutions are created, Where There Is No Doctor is probably a useful stop-gap measure.

Temple of Trajan

The Temple of Trajan was a Roman temple built in the Forum of Trajan, placed in ancient Rome in the 2nd century by Trajan's adoptive son and successor Hadrian between 125 and 138. It was dedicated to the emperor Trajan and his wife Plotina after his deification by the Roman Senate. It was destroyed in the Middle Ages.
Site.
Though research has still not precisely determined its site with precision. It had been assumed it was on the site of Palazzo Valentini and that this palazzo had reused stone from the temple in its construction but archaeological excavations there have found no trace of a temple, only remains of "insulae" with shallower foundations than those needed for a temple. This possibly puts the temple at the centre of the forum courtyard, looking towards the forum of Augustus or elsewhere (some have suggested the two rooms in the Library, though there is evidence against this) and not in a northern position as has previously been commonly accepted by archaeologists for more than a century. 
History.
The temple's dedicatory inscription survives in the Vatican Museums and an enormous monolithic granite column (2m in diameter) with a white marble capital (2.12m high on its own) survives near Trajan's Column perhaps belongs to the temple. Among Hadrian's many buildings, it was only this one to which he wished to affix his name. The temple was probably enormous in dimensions and surrounded by a portico like the temple of Hadrian. However, Trajan was not buried in the temple but in the triumphal column's base.

Adane Girma and Getaneh Kebede of Dedebit FC shared the Ethiopian Premier League 2010/11 goal scoring title after they finished the season with 20 goals each. He was also awarded as best player of the league in that season.
Adane was named to the Ethiopian squad for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. He scored the equalizer in team Ethiopia's first match against Zambia in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, in Nelspruit, South Africa.
Adane picked an injury in the early minutes of the match against Burkina faso and left the pitch on tear.
First African cup of nations.
Adane Girma was a key player for the national team during the qualification of the 2013 African Cup of Nations. On his first appearance of African Cup of Nations, Adane played at central midfielder position in place of another sensational young midfielder Addis Hintsa. Because of the more cautious approach to the first match against 2012 Champions Zambia, the Coach chose to play Adane in the central position, leaving Addis Hintsa on the bench. With great skill and short passing, Adane managed to lead the team to a draw. His team played with only 10-man for more than 70 minutes of the match. Shortly after the introduction of Addis Hintsa, Adane played in a more in attacking position. On the 65th minute, Adane would receive a great pass from the striker Saladin Said which he would convert to a magnificent low corner goal.

Woodcutters (novel)

Woodcutters (German title: Holzfällen) is a novel by Thomas Bernhard, also published in 1985 in another English translation (by Ewald Osers) under the title Cutting Timber: An Irritation, and originally published in German in 1984. 
Second in a trilogy covering the Arts, this one relates to the theatre and created quite an uproar in Austria, where it was banned as some Viennese personalities recognised themselves in the story. Nonetheless, it still sold very well in its own country and became a bestseller abroad.
In his Western Canon of 1994, American literary critic Harold Bloom lists "Woodcutters" as Bernhard’s masterpiece.
Plot summary.
It’s eleven thirty at night in an elegant Viennese home in the 80s. A group of people are awaiting – with some impatience and increasing appetite – the arrival of a famous dramatic actor, guest of honour, in order to start eating the sophisticated dinner, in fact the "artistic dinner", as the hosts love to state. The place is that of the Auersbergers, a married couple whom the narrator hasn’t seen for twenty years: she’s a singer, he’s a "composer in the wake of Webern", both "idiosyncratically consumed". The play just performed by the awaited actor is one of Ibsen’s: "The Wild Duck" at the Burgtheater. 
The whole novel is an account of what the narrator sees and hears while sitting on a chair with a glass of champagne in his hand and, subsequently, at the table during dinner. Bernhard devastates with the axe of his prose (just like a "wood cutter") the world of pretentiousness and intellectual inconsistence, not only related to a certain Viennese scene, but also to all that surrounds us: he’s implacable, ferociously comic, inexhaustible in the variations and returns to theme.
The scene develops and the "artistic dinner" unravels in all its hypocritical farce, whilst the narrator relives the last two decades, his connections and affective ties with the various guests, his relationship with the woman (Joana) who united in friendship all of them and finally committed suicide. In closing, the novel reaches momentum through the actor’s indignant outburst against one of the guests (Billroth) who had been offensive to him and malignant to all the whole night. He then becomes sad and reflective and allows, in a maudlin and romanticized scene, that he often believes he would have been better off to lived a rural life and to have been a woodcutter. The marvellous play on the word which allows both the romanticism of this world of the native savage, and yet refers to the super sophisticated and bitter criticism of the social cynic is a stroke of Bernhardian genius. When the elderly actor is so openly wounded by Billroth, the narrator turns from derogatory to sympathetic, and virtually shifts his view of the Burgtheater actor and even the Burgtheater into praising.
Excerpt.
The most revealing lines of the novel are about Bernhard and are the last two sentences of the text, which tell us just what he does when his inner sensibilities so overwhelm him that he cannot stand it any longer: ""And as I went on running I thought: I'll write something at once, no matter what -- I'll write about this artistic dinner in the Gentzgasse" at once, "now. Now, I thought" -- at once, "I told myself over and over again as I ran through the Inner City" -- at once, "I told myself," now -- at once, at once, "before it's too late.""

Batia lunaris

The Lesser Tawny Crescent (Batia lunaris) is a species of gelechioid moth. It belongs to the subfamily Oecophorinae of the concealer moth family (Oecophoridae). It is the type species of the genus "Batia", which is sometimes treated as monotypic. But this is not well warranted, as some other species usually placed there differ little from the Lesser Tawny Crescent.
Description and ecology.
Its wingspan is 7–10 mm, and in general the imagines (adults) resemble the close relative "B. lambdella", but are only two-thirds the size of that species. Their forewings are dark ochre, slightly darker at the tips and the hairy fringe surrounding them. At the border between the light and dark parts there is a dark blotch at the dorsal margin, which forms a continuous pointed patch if the wings are laid back while the moth rests.
It is found in Europe, where it is not rare in many woodlands. It is even widespread at the outer limit of its range, being a common sight in most of England for example. The adults fly in July and August depending on the location. This moth is generally nocturnal, but can be attracted by bright lights. The habits of their caterpillars are not sufficiently known; there is no reason to assume that they differ in that respect from their relatives, which generally live under bark and eat rotting wood and sometimes fungi.
Synonyms.
Junior synonyms of "B. lunularis" are:.

Francis Xavier Clooney

Francis Xavier Clooney, S.J., is an American Jesuit Roman Catholic priest and scholar in the teachings of Hinduism. He is currently a professor at Harvard Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Career.
A native of Staten Island, New York, he entered the novitiate of Society of Jesus after high school. Following that, he earned his Bachelor's Degree at Fordham University in the Bronx, New York. 
After earning his doctorate in South Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago in 1984, Clooney taught at Boston College until 2005, when he became the Parkman Professor of Divinity and Professor of Comparative Theology at Harvard Divinity School. In 2010 he became the Director of Harvard's Center for the Study of World Religions. That same year he was named a Fellow of the British Academy.
His primary areas of scholarship are theological commentarial writings in the Sanskrit and Tamil traditions of Hindu India, and the developing field of comparative theology, a discipline distinguished by attentiveness to the dynamics of theological learning deepened and enriched through the study of traditions other than one's own. He has also written on the Jesuit missionary tradition, particularly in India, and the dynamics of dialogue in the contemporary world.
Clooney sits on a number of editorial boards, was the first president of the International Society for Hindu-Christian Studies and, from 1998 to 2004, was coordinator for interreligious dialogue for the Jesuits of the United States. Clooney has authored several articles and books; his current projects include a study of yoga and Jesuit spirituality.
Works.
Hindu Wisdom for All God's Children.
"Hindu Wisdom for All God’s Children" is an introduction to comparative theology. It provides a brief history of his experience with Hinduism during Clooney's time spent teaching in Nepal. This book doesn’t initially require much previous knowledge of Hinduism or Indian culture to understand and therefore provides a good initial introduction to comparative theology and Clooney. It also shows what one can learn about God from the Hindu religious tradition by taking a look at various Hindu gods. "Hindu Wisdom for All God's Children" began first as a series of lectures given at John Carroll University in 1996 and was later developed into a book.
The book's introduction is significant to understanding Clooney's interest in eastern religions. As part of his early Jesuit training, Clooney was expected to teach high school. He chose to travel to Kathmandu, Nepal, and teach 9th-grade boys at St. Xavier’s High School. Looking for a way to teach moral values to his students, Clooney turned to the "Bhagavad Gita". He used the stories of the Buddha's life and teachings to relate to the Nepali boys he was teaching. This was the first time that Clooney had studied the Bhagavad Gita.
Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries Between Religions.
In "Hindu God, Christian God", Clooney compares Christian theology and Hindu theology in four areas: the existence of God, what is the true God, divine embodiment, and the revelation of God. Clooney considers the similarities between Christianity and Hinduism's theological answers to these topics. Clooney then draws four major conclusions about God: the world is complex and there is a God who created the world, this God can be further identified by drawing reasonable conclusions about who God is and how He will likely act, God is not limited to the restrictiveness of a body but can choose to assume this limited form, and there is divine revelation. This book is helpful in seeing how Clooney's ideas about God develop through his studying of the theology of religions outside of Christianity.

Blu-spec CD

Blu-spec CD describes a Red Book Compact Disc manufactured by a proprietary process introduced by Sony Music Entertainment Japan in late 2008. Its name derives from the similar manufacturing process to that used to create Blu-ray Discs. Instead of a traditional infra-red laser, a blue laser is used for recording the pits on the CD master that is needed for disc replication. The blue laser creates more precise pits, reducing distortion in the optical read-out process. 
On 28 September 2012, Sony Music Entertainment Japan announced "Blu-spec CD2" or BSCD2, a progression of the Blu-spec CD format which employs a more precise BD cutting machine, a master disc that is made from the same smooth material as silicon wafers for chip manufacture, and a different recording layer material for the master disc. Sony refers to this process as "Phase Transition Mastering".
A Blu-spec CD can be played on all CD players and does not require a blue laser to be read. The same holds true for Blu-spec CD2 discs.

Bland baronets

The Bland Baronetcy, of Kippax Park in the County of York, was a title in the Baronetage of England. It was created on 30 August 1642 for Robert Bland, of Kippax Hall, near Leeds, Yorkshire, in honour of his father's service to King Charles I. The third Baronet succeeded his father as an infant, died at the age of five and was succeeded by his brother who was Member of Parliament for Appleby 1681 and for Pontefract 1698-1713. The fifth Baronet represented Lancashire 1713-27 and the sixth Baronet served as member for Ludgershall 1754-5. His brother succeeded in 1755 but died in 1756 when the baronetcy became extinct.
The Kippax estate fell to Thomas Davison of Blakiston Hall who married a daughter of the sixth Baronet and then to their son Thomas Davison Bland. The Davison Blands lived at Kippax until 1928. Kippax Hall was demolished in the 1950s.

Fukuoka Subway 1000 series

The is an electric multiple unit operated by the Fukuoka City Transportation Bureau on the Hakozaki Line and Kūkō Line in Fukuoka, Japan. The trains also inter-run to/from the Chikuhi Line, operated by Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu).
History.
The 1000 series entered service on the Fukuoka City Subway coinciding with its opening on July 26, 1981. 
In 1982 it received the 22nd "Laurel Award" which is granted by a committee for excellent design.
The first eight trains were manufactured by Kinki Sharyo in 1981. To cope with operations on the Chikuhi Line, seven more trains were built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in 1982. Three more sets were built by Nippon Sharyo (1984), Tokyu Car Corporation (1985), and Hitachi (1986). The fleet consists of a total of 18 trainsets (108 cars).
Driver-only operation commenced on January 20, 1984 using automatic train control (ATC), and the cabs are equipped with a master controller, brake handle, and automatic train stop (ATS) system for manual operation.
Design.
Because the train line runs near the coast, car bodies were constructed of a stainless steel skin on a conventional steel frame for corrosion resistance. The car bodies are unpainted with blue and white stripes representing the Genkai Sea.
Each car is 20 m long with four pairs of doors per side. Early trainsets had opening windows, but these were subsequently replaced with sealed windows. 
The trains have emergency exit doors at the ends. The doors and window wipers were added after refurbishment.
The longitudinal seats are covered with a red moquette and some parts of the saloons feature woodgrain panelling. In 1982, wheelchair spaces were added to the cars. All trains are air-conditioned.
Refurbishment.
Between 1997 and 2004, 15 years after the first trains were built and after the introduction of the 2000 series, the trains underwent refurbishment. After refurbishment, the trains were called 1000N series. Refurbishment included the following major modifications.
In 2000, Hitachi manufactured a three-level Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) traction inverter for the trains, and in 2001 it was changed into a full-electric brake with a two-level IGBT.

Via Nazionale (Rome)

Via Nazionale is a street in Rome from Piazza della Repubblica leading towards Piazza Venezia.
Already begun as via Pia, named in honour of Pius IX, who had wanted to connect Stazione Termini to the city-centre, the street was completed at the end of the 19th century through the ambition of several figures of the Risorgimento to create a "new Rome" as a capital of the unified Kingdom of Italy.
The enlargement of this artery was necessary to create a link between Rome's central station and the most populous part of the city, and the new road was extended to the east bank of the river Tiber by the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II. However, the construction works ripped the heart out of the city by demolishing buildings in its path (including palazzi such as the National Dramatic Theatre), which substantially modified the previous street's route.

Franz Maria Liedig

Franz Maria Liedig (1900-1967) was a German Navy Officer and member of the military resistance against Adolf Hitler.
Biography.
Liedig volunteered the German Imperial Navy in October 1916, was educated at the Naval Academy Mürwik and served as an Artillery Officer on a Torpedo boat. After a short time of internment at Scapa Flow in 1919, he started to study at the Technical University Munich. Liedig was a member of the Freikorps Marinebrigade Ehrhardt, deployed in Berlin and Upper Silesia in 1919/20, and a participant of the Kapp Putsch in March 1920. Liedig left the German Navy in September 1920 and was active in some rightwing organisations throughout the 1920s. Liedig studied law and worked as a lawyer.
In 1936 he rejoined the Navy at the instigation of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, who knew Liedig from the Freikorps episode. Here he came in contact to members of the German military resistance such as Hans Oster and Hans von Dohnanyi. Around September 20, 1938 the leading members of that opposition Erwin von Witzleben, Hans Bernd Gisevius, Hans Oster, Hans von Dohnanyi, and assumedly Carl Friedrich Goerdeler met Abwehr Captain Friedrich Wilhelm Heinz and Franz-Maria Liedig at Oster’s house in Berlin. Heinz and Liedig were instructed to form an assault group to arrest Adolf Hitler. After Witzleben left that meeting, both decided to shoot Hitler if possible. The plans were abolished after the Munich Conference.
On October 8, 1939 Liedig drove Hans Oster to the Dutch Military attaché in Berlin, Colonel Bert Sas. After Oster returned to the car, he told Liedig, that he just committed treason. In fact Oster informed Sas about the planned date of attack of the German Wehrmacht in the West.
In 1940 Liedig became the Military attaché at the German embassy in Sofia and later on in Athens. In February 1944 he was removed as the First Officer of the German cruiser Köln in Oslo.
After von Dohnanyi, Oster and Canaris were arrested by the Gestapo and the 20 July plot failed, the plans of 1938 were found on September 22, 1944 at the Abwehr and Liedig was arrested in November 1944. He was imprisoned at several concentration camps like Flossenbürg, Buchenwald, Dachau and finally transferred to Niederdorf amongst about 140 prominent inmates in late April 1945, where the SS left them behind.
Liedig was a founding member of the Christian Social Union of Bavaria in 1946 and their political executive in 1946 – 48.
Liedig died in 1967.

Hofmannophila pseudospretella

The Brown House Moth (Hofmannophila pseudospretella) is a species of the concealer moth family (Oecophoridae), wherein it belongs to subfamily Oecophorinae. It is the only known member of its genus Hofmannophila, and as is often the case for such monotypic taxa, the genus' distinctness remains to be conclusively proven. However that may be, it seems to be a close relative of "Borkhausenia".
Probably originally native to Asia, the synanthropic Brown House Moth has been introduced to other regions by human activity and is found almost worldwide today. It is often considered a pest due to the feeding activity of its caterpillars.
The wingspan is 15–26 mm. The adults fly all year round.
The caterpillars feed on organic detritus that accumulates indoors, e.g. behind skirting boards and other similar places. Recorded foodstuffs are for example cereals (including maize, oatmeal, pearl barley and rice) and other seeds, potatoes, furs and dog biscuits.

John Charles Dollman

John Charles Dollman RWS RI ROI (1851–1934) was an English painter and illustrator.
Dollman was born in Hove on 6 May 1851 and moved to London to study at South Kensington and the Royal Academy Schools, after which he set up a studio at Bedford Park, London. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1870 to 1912, and was elected RWS (Member of the Royal Watercolour Society) in 1913. Dollman was also an illustrator, working in black and white or colour for magazines such as the Graphic during and after the 1880s. Some of his early work has been said to have influenced Van Gogh.
Works.
A central theme was ambitious mythological pictures such as "a Viking Foray", a Viking horde entitled "the Ravager", "The Unknown" (1912), featuring a girl surrounded by chimps and "Orpheus and his Lute with Lions". He also produced bold compositions of animals and people such as "Robinson Crusoe and His Man Friday", "Polo" and "Mowgli made leader of the Bandar-log" (1903). His best known work is possibly "A London Cab Stand" (1888), focussing on a group of horses in a stormy scene. He composed at least three variants of this picture, and there are other instances where he made copies or near-copies of individual pictures. In the 1890s he painted pictures of soldiers, and some less well regarded genre pictures of people with animals. He also painted wild animal pictures without attempting any narrative content.
Dollman's works are in the collections of various galleries. "The Immigrants' Ship" (1884) is in the Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide. 'The Ravager' is owned by the Trustees of the Royal Watercolour Society, London.
A version of "The Unknown" is in the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle. A "London Cab Stand" is in the London Museum. "A Dog's Home, Table d'Hote" (1879) is in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, and "During the Time of the Sermonses" (1896), an odd picture of a pair of religious people approaching two golfers, is in the collection of the Harris Museum, Preston, while 'Famine' (1904) is at the Salford Museum and Art Gallery. "Ride of the Valkyries" is located in the Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth.
Dollman died in London on 11 December 1934, aged 83. He was the father of noted zoologist and taxonomist Guy Dollman.

Agonopterix arenella is a species of moth of the family Oecophoridae. It is found in all of Europe, except the Iberian Peninsula.
The wingspan is 19–23 mm.
The larvae feed on "Arctium lappa", "Carduus", "Carlina", "Centaurea jacea", "Centaurea nigra", "Centaurea scabiosa", "Cirsium vulgare", "Knautia", "Serratula tinctoria" and "Sonchus". They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a short full depth corridor. The larva soon vacates the mine, creating a spinning at the leaf underside, from where it causes window feeding. Larvae can be found from May to early August. They are pale green or yellowish with a pale brown or yellowish head.

Di Shan

Di Shan (, d. 119 BC) was an erudite in the court of Emperor Wu of the western Han dynasty. He was killed by a Xiongnu attack.
When the Xiongnu sought an alliance and the matter was being discussed by various officials, Di Shan declared that he was in favour of peace. Asked to elaborate by the emperor, he criticised the impact of war on resources and the standard of living of those near the border. He cited the examples of both internal and external conflicts under past reigns and juxtaposed the hardship of these times with the prosperity enjoyed during times of peace. Zhang Tang, when consulted on his opinion, dismissed Di Shan as a stupid Confucianist with no understanding of the matter. Di Shan responded by admitting that his loyalty was the "loyalty of the stupid" but then accused Zhang Tang of being dishonest in his loyalty, using as evidence the latter's forceful prosecution of the kings of Huainan and Jiangdu.
Emperor Wu then asked Di Shan whether he could keep out the Xiongnu if made a governor of a province. When the latter responded by saying he could not, the emperor proposed that he be made magistrate of a district, an offer that he similarly rebuffed. However, Di Shan finally relented when offered the position of commander of a guard post, afraid that he would be handed over for trial if he refused. Within a little over a month, Di Shan had been decapitated following a Xiongnu raid on his guard post.

Palazzo delle Esposizioni

The Palazzo delle Esposizioni is a neoclassical exhibition hall, cultural center and museum on Via Nazionale in Rome, Italy.
Designed by Pio Piacentini, it opened in 1883. It has housed several exhibitions (e.g. Mostra della Rivoluzione Fascista, Mostra Augustea della Romanità), and was temporarily modified during the fascist era due to its style being thought to be out of step with the times.
The building is owned by the City of Rome and the museum is administered by Azienda Speciale Palaexpo, an agency ran by the City's Office for Education and Culture.
It has a 139 seat cinema, a 90 seat auditorium, a cafe, a large 240 person restaurant, a library and a multi-functional room known as the Forum.

Torras i Bages (Barcelona Metro)

Torras i Bages is a station of the Barcelona Metro, on L1 (red line). Opened in 1968, it serves the northern part of the Sant Andreu de Palomar neighbourhood in the Sant Andreu district, and was one of the termini of this subway line until 1983, when it was extended into Santa Coloma de Gramenet. The station doesn't include accessibility facilities as of 2008. It has two 107 m. long platforms, and it's unusual for a subway station of its kind in having three railtracks as opposed to two, due to its former role as line terminus. The current railtrack leading to Fondo is actually a secondary one.
The station is named after a road, Passeig de Torras i Bages (and ultimately after the 19th century bishop of Vic Josep Torras i Bages.

Paweł Chęciński

Paweł Chęciński is a Polish pianist, b. in Łódź. He settled in the USA in 1971.
Born in Lodz, Poland, Pawel Checinski (Pah-vel Hen-chin-ski) began piano studies at the age of six. He completed his elementary and intermediate education in schools for the musically gifted. At the Music Academy in Warsaw, he studied with two of Poland’s most renowned pedagogues, Zbigniew Drzewiecki and Ryszard Bakst, and received the Master of Arts degree with honors. In 1971 Checinski was awarded a Fulbright Grant by the U.S. Department of State to continue his studies at the Juilliard School where he earned both a Master of Music degree and a Doctor of Musical Arts degree under Mieczyslaw Munz. He also studied with Leon Fleisher and Aube Tzerko. For several years he worked extensively under the guidance of his mentor Claudio Arrau.
Successful in numerous international competitions, Checinski received a special award in the Chopin International Competition in Warsaw and was a prize winner in the Smetana International Competition in Czechoslovakia and the International Piano Competition in Sydney, Australia. He won first prize at the National Competition for Music of the Classic Era that was held in Poland. In 1972 Checinski won the Concert Artists Guild Annual Auditions in New York and the Temple University Music Festival Concerto Competition in Pennsylvania. Additional awards include the Rachmaninov Prize at the Second International Competition of Guanabara in Rio de Janeiro and the Ravel Centennial Medal at the first Robert Casadesus International Piano Competition in Cleveland. He has been praised for his incisive interpretations of contemporary Polish music, particularly that of Karol Szymanowski, for which he received the Szymanowski Medal from Poland.
He made his first major appearance outside of Poland at the Moscow Conservatory. His reputation as an outstanding and highly original interpreter of the music of Chopin secured his premiere performance in the West, which took place at the Wigmore Hall in London, England. His U.S. debut occurred at Carnegie Recital Hall in New York, which led to performances in places such as Lincoln Center in New York, Philadelphia’s Academy of Music, and Chicago’s Auditorium Theatre and Orchestra Hall. 
He was a featured artist on the Dame Myra Hess Concert Series in Chicago and on the Phillips Collection recital series in Washington, D.C. Checinski performed an all Szymanowski concert as New York’s celebration of the centennial of the composer’s birth and a commemorative recital featuring works written for and dedicated to Artur Rubinstein. As a featured soloist he performed at the inaugural concert of Chicago’s “Symphony II” orchestra. He performed what is believed to be the Chicago premiere of Chopin’s Fantasy on Polish Airs with orchestra. In 2005 he appeared at Orchestra Hall to once again bring Chopin’s Fantasy to the Chicago concert stage.
An influential teacher, Checinski’s teaching history includes positions at the Pennsylvania State University, the University of British Columbia, Columbia College (SC), and Roosevelt University’s Chicago College of Performing Arts (Artist-in-Residence). He has conducted master classes in the United States, Poland, Canada, and across Asia.
Pawel Checinski has frequently performed recitals devoted entirely to the music of one composer. These recitals presented the music of Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, Brahms, Ravel, Scriabin, Szymanowski, and Prokofiev. He has appeared as a soloist with many orchestras. His repertoire with orchestra includes Beethoven’s five piano concerti, all of Chopin’s works for piano and orchestra, Rachmaninov’s Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini, Szymanowski’s Symphonie Concertante, and other concerti of many composers.
Checinski’s extensive performing career has spanned five continents including the countries of Poland, Hungary, England, Czechoslovakia, Germany, the Soviet Union, Brazil, Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of China, Canada, and the United States. This international exposure has afforded him with what he considers to be the invaluable opportunity of communicating with people of diverse national and cultural backgrounds through his music.
He was trained under Ryszard Bakst, Zbigniew Drzewiecki (Warsaw Higher State School of Music), Mieczysław Munz and Leon Fleisher (Juilliard School). His Western debut was at the Wigmore Hall. Chęciński won the 1972 Concert Artists Guild Annual Auditions and the Temple University Music Festival Concerto Competition in Pennsylvania, and was prized at the inaugural editions of the Robert Casadesus Competition and the Sydney Competition.
He has widely performed both in the American concert scene and abroad, and has taught at the Pennsylvania State University, the University of British Columbia and the Roosevelt University’s Chicago College of Performing Arts, where he served as the institution's artist-in-residence. He is a recipient of the Karol Szymanowski Medal.

Constantin Costăchescu

Constantin "Bibi" Costăchescu was a submarine commander in the Romanian Navy during the Second World War. He is the only Romanian submarine commander to sink an enemy ship.
The attack.
On its 5th patrol in the Black Sea, the NMS "Dolphin"'s orders were to cut the Russian supply routes for Sevastopol. The patrol lasted from 2–7 November 1941. Its commanding officer (CO) was Constantin Costăchescu. It was his 3rd patrol as the CO of the "Dolphin" (from the first 5 patrols of the Dolphin, Constantin Costăchescu was the CO for the 1st, 3rd and 5th). On the morning of 5 November at 08:05, sub lieutenant Constantin Stegaru spotted a big transport ship steaming for Yalta. At 08:43, Costăchescu launched one aft tube torpedo from away. In a couple of moments, the torpedo explosion followed by another bigger one could be heard. It is possible that the ship was not escorted, because the first contact with the Soviet submarine-hunter ships took place after an hour. The anti submarine attack lasted from 10:30 until 18:30 and there were 80 to 90 depth charge explosions.
Costăchescu was awarded the Order of Michael the Brave 3rd class. Romanian historians identified the Russian ship as being the "Uralles", 1975-tonne cargo boat, but Soviet archives state that the "Uralles" was sunk by Luftwaffe bombers in the port of Eupatoria on the 29 October 1941. To this day, the identity of the ship remains an open debate.
After the war.
After the war, Constantin Costăchescu served as an instructor for Romanian submariners and as a professor at the Navy Academy in Constanţa, teaching future navy officers spatial geometry.
He died in the 1980s, after a hard fall on ice during a cold winter in Constanţa.
Because of the Communist regime, his merits were never acknowledged.

Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon

The Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon (Observatório Astronómico de Lisboa) is located in "Alcântara - Tapada da Ajuda", in the city of Lisbon. It’s an institution that has been recognized internationally for the quality of its work in the field of positioning astronomy, since the 19th century.
In 1992, this institution came to depend on the University of Lisbon and in 1995 it was included in the Science Faculty of the University of Lisbon, with its operations directed towards research and scientific and historical dissemination.
History.
The Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon, established by a Law Act on 6 May 1878, was born from great controversy between Hervé Faye, director of the Observatory of Paris and Peters, astronomer at the Russian Observatory of Pulkova, on the parallax of the star of Argelander. The construction of the AOL was due to the strong desire to build a magnificent institution, a reference in Portuguese culture. The foundations were established in the mid-19th century with the aim of promoting new Sidereal Astronomy, discovery and understanding of the infinite cosmos, and concern about the exact mapping of the sky and measuring the size of the universe. It was then suggested that it would be built in Lisbon, a place across the European continent where it was possible to make observations of that star of Argelander using a zenithal telescope. In order to do so, it was necessary to build a new observatory where you could install the appropriate equipment. This reality was possible due to the support of King D. Pedro V and other personalities of political life, then. 
The plant of the building, executed by the French architect Jean Colson, who was then the most distinguished foreign architect living in Lisbon, was inspired by the building of the Russian Observatory in Pulkova. Wilhelm Struve, director of the Pulkova and a famous astronomer, offered his services to the Portuguese government and was considered the main adviser who played a very important role, not only in the choice of equipment, but also in the orientation of astronomer Frederico Augusto Oom, who was given a rough training stage of 5 years. This Lieutenant of the Navy and Hydrographer Engineer, who became the first director of the Royal Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon, had a very important role in the whole foundation of this building. After the financial support and commitment that King D. Pedro V gave to this project, its construction started on 11 March 1861, under the rule of King D. Luis I, who also contributed to funding the institution, withdrawing money from his personal budget. The edification only ended in 1867, the year in which astronomical observations began. 
The Observatory was installed in Ajuda, on land readily offered by the monarch, in the king’s hunting grounds. Since its creation in the 19th century and during much of the 20th century, the Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon has stood out for its excellent work in Astrometry. It has participated in several international campaigns, in particular the international campaign in 1900-1901 to improve the value of the AU (astronomical unit) using the opposition of the recently found asteroid Eros. It also had the contribution of its director at the time, Campos Rodrigues, and other local astronomers, to produce a high-quality catalogue of reference stars. The results were so good that the AOL was the only observatory contributing with data and weight to all the 3800 observations which were used to calculate the catalogue. Campos Rodrigues received the Valz prize in 1904 from the French Academy of Sciences for the excellence of the work that was being done at Lisbon.
Heritage.
The Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon consists of a beautiful central building in the hills of Ajuda and overlooking the Tejo river; there are also two small cupolas outside that are containing instruments, located South. Besides the central cupola there are three rooms of astronomical observations, properly equipped with instruments (the best of the time) and windows of observation. They are in the north, east and west wings of the central building. 
It is the central building of the Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon, a circular room (whose vault is richly worked) which supports the weight of the large equatorial refractor on 8 columns of great size. In arches between the columns the many pendulum clocks are arranged, those which during this century of existence have been measuring the time. At the foot of large windows overlooking the Tapada, there are wide tables on which the astronomers developed their research work. 
There are also the spacious halls of communication that were used at the time for lessons, for making the calculations, and so on. Today these rooms are used for the workshops of activities of education and support to schools. 
The three observation rooms of the building are very spacious and very high, lined with wood, leaving a free space between the coating and the walls of masonry and roofing. This space communicates with the outside world through gaps that are constantly open. There are roofs of rooms in stacks of circulation, and this permanent ventilation is there in order to establish the balance of air temperature in the rooms and beyond, as it is convenient to the accuracy of observations. The coating is made of wood to present an excellent thermal behaviour, apart from being a 100% ecological product, which provides the user with a friendlier environment compared to other substitute materials. The rooms provide openings in the side walls and in the ceiling, through doors, thanks to an ingenious mechanism. Once the doors open once they give you an insight to the sky, according to the meridian of Lisbon, from north to south.
Museum and instruments.
The undeniable value of the AOL in all parameters of cultural heritage it contains, the historic buildings and scientific instruments of the past, makes the understanding of our own roots easier, by helping us make the bridge between the past and present. The historic preservation of this heritage is accomplished through guided tours to the Museum of AOL. At the beginning of the visit, visitors are invited to attend an oral presentation visually sustained by powerpoint slides. A presentation is made of the evolution of astronomy since the 19th century until now, marking the substantial difference to advances that have occurred. Alongside the exhibition of the evolution of astronomy, the story of the AOL is reported, since it arose precisely in the middle of that century. Then visitors take a visit to the museum area, with the guides showing and explaining the various instruments. One of the most striking features in all instruments of the AOL is that not only that they are all still functional, but also that they have never been modernized with electric motors or components or any pieces (gears, micrometers, lenses, etc.) or complete systems (monitoring, engines, etc..) nor replaced by better and more modern equipment. In some cases, small changes were introduced, but most parts are from the same period of the instrument. Very few are those cases where we may be considered modern machinery. This is true only of cameras introduced in the late 60, micrometers of readings near the Meridian Circle to take pictures of decline. There is also the new plate to the general equatorial refractor, which includes a very modern micrometer for studying double stars (part), which was built in Nice in 1990. However, it’s not associated with the telescope. It’s true the telescopes are not perfectly aligned or optically collimated, nor the pendulum clocks are working and would some adjustments would have to be made.
The same thing can be said about the building: all moving structures are still function as the original and nothing has changed, been replaced by new solutions or even by modern materials. Thus, we continue to suffer from traditional problems such as leakage of rainwater in some domes in windy nights. Unfortunately, the preservation of works made in 2000 removed the old wiring, including that associated with the signs of time connected to all telescopes through the Electricity Table, which was a great loss, since it was the "jewel in the crown" of all telescopes - which is always a subjective statement given the beauty and value out of them all, but considering the AOL as a house of pure astrometry, it gave recognition to the work done there, due to the Meridian Circle recital, so all that has auxiliary accessories.

Muscodor albus

Muscodor albus (frequently spelled "muscador albus") is a plant-dwelling fungus in the Xylariaceae family. It was first discovered in the bark of a cinnamon tree in Honduras. It has the ability to produce a mixture of volatile compounds, including alcohols and esters, which can kill pathogens like molds and bacteria such as listeria and salmonella and many plant pathogens. It also acts as an insecticide, killing potato tuber moths, codling moths and their larvae.
Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service investigated the antimicrobial effects of "Muscodor albus" on "Botrytis cinerea", which causes the common grey mold found on table grapes. Researchers found that "Muscodor albus" reduces the occurrence of "Botrytis cinerea" up to 85% on table grapes. Utilizing "Muscodor albus"' antimicrobial effects is ideal for organic farmers who suffer a loss in yield due to the grey mold, which is usually treated with sulfur dioxide.
Other isolates considered to be varieties of M. albus have been identified in Thailand, on Myristica fragrans, and in Australia's Northern Territory, on plants such as Grevillea pterifolia (fern-leafed grevillea), Kennedia nigriscans (snakevine) and Terminalia prostrata (nanka bakarra).

Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution

The Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution ("Mostra della Rivoluzione Fascista") was a show held in Rome at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni from 1932 to 1934. Opened by Mussolini on 28 October 1932, it had 4 million visitors.
Its director and designer was Dino Alfieri, with the cooperation of Luigi Freddi and Cipriano Efisio Oppo. Seen as a great success, it was repeated in 1937 and 1942, though these two repeats did not have the same public success.
Telling the evolution of Italian history from 1914 to the March on Rome, it was never conceived as an objective representation of the facts or as being solely based on the exhibiting of historic documents, but as a work of Fascist propaganda to influence and involve the audience emotionally. For this reason not only historians were called in to assist in the exhibition, but also exponents of various artistic currents of the era, such as Mario Sironi, Enrico Prampolini, Gerardo Dottori, Adalberto Libera and Giuseppe Terragni.

Enrico Prampolini

Enrico Prampolini (20 April 1894, Modena – 17 June 1956, Rome) was an Italian Futurist painter, sculptor and scenographer. He assisted in the design of the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution and was (like Gerardo Dottori) active in Aeropainting. 
He pursued a programme of abstract and quasi-abstract painting, combined with a career in stage design. His "Spatial-Landscape Construction" (1919) is quasi-abstract with large flat areas in bold colours, predominantly red, orange, blue and dark green. His "Simultaneous Landscape" (1922) is totally abstract, with flat colours and no attempt to create perspective. In his "Umbrian Landscape" (1929), produced in the year of the Aeropainting Manifesto, Prampolini returns to figuration, representing the hills of Umbria. But by 1931 he had adopted "cosmic idealism", a biomorphic abstractionism quite different from the works of the previous decade, for example in "Pilot of the Infinite" (1931) and "Biological Apparition" (1940).
Prampolini was an influence on Tullio Crali.

SV Schalding-Heining

The SV Schalding-Heining is a German association football club from the suburb of Schalding-Heining in the city of Passau, Bavaria. One of the clubs main achievements is the fact that it was the first winner of the Bavarian Cup in 1998. 
History.
The club was formed on 22 May 1946, after the Second World War, mostly from players of the "FC Rittsteig", which had gone defunct during the war. The formation was initiated by a friendly between the villages of Schalding and Heining, which ended 0–0. Originally, the club name was simply SV Schalding but in the early 1950s it was altered to SV Schalding-Heining.
The club achieved some immediate success, winning its league, the "C-Klasse Passau" and earning promotion to the "B-Klasse Passau" in 1947. For the next forty years, the "SV S-H" would fluctuate between the local "A-Klasse" and "C-Klasse", the later being the lowest tier of league football in Bavaria.
In 1989, the club for the first time managed to leave the local leagues, earning promotion to the "Bezirksliga Niederbayern-Ost" (VI). After a short stint and relegation, it returned to this level in 1992. This time with more success, the "SV" survived in this league and earned promotion to the "Bezirksoberliga Niederbayern" in 1994, the highest league in the Lower Bavaria region.
It earned a league championship in the "BOL" in its first season but chose to decline promotion to the next level up at this stage. A second title in this league in 1999 however meant the "SV" now accepted promotion, to the "Landesliga Bayern-Mitte", the league the club would spent its time in since then a second place in 2007 being its greatest success. In this season, 2006–07, the club managed to win 14 games in a row which contributed largely to this achievement. This qualified the team for the promotion round where it lost to TSV Grossbardorf 2–3 after leading 2–0 after 11 minutes.
While the club remained an undistinguished league side, it archived far more success on local cup level, rising as far becoming the first team to win the Bavarian Cup in 1998. Through this, the club gained entry to the DFB Cup 1998-99, where it lost narrowly to SpVgg Unterhaching in the first round of the competition. Additionally, the club also won the "Niederbayern Cup" on four occasions, in 1998, 2003, 2007 and 2009.
The club was in its eleventh "Landesliga" season in 2008–09 when it finally won promotion to the Oberliga Bayern, after coming first in the league. It also is won the "Niederbayern Cup" once more.
It only lasted for two seasons in Bavaria's highest league, being relegated in 2011. In the 2011-12 season the team came second in the Landesliga and earned the right to take part in the promotion round to the new Regionalliga Bayern. While the club was knocked out in the first round by FC Schweinfurt 05 it nevertheless qualified for an expanded Bayernliga from 2012.
In the 2012-13 season the club took out the championship in the southern division of the Bayernliga and thereby earned direct promotion to the Regionalliga Bayern.
Local rivals.
Traditionally, the biggest club in the city of Passau is the FC Passau but the SV Schalding-Heining and the "FCP" have rarely played in the same league. From 2000 to 2003 and again in 2006–07, both clubs competed in the "Landesliga". The "FCP" has since dropped down to the "Bezirksoberliga", making the "SV S-H" the number one in town, for the time.

Luigi Freddi

Luigi Freddi (1895, Milan – 1977, Sabaudia) was an Italian journalist and politician, principally notable for being the first vice seсretary of the "Fasci italiani all'estero", and later one of those most responsible for Italian political cinema in the second half of the 1930s and the start of the 1940s.
As a futurist and a legionario fiumiano, he edited "Il Popolo d'Italia" and in 1920 was one of the founders of the student avant-garde within the fighting Fascist party and became director of the review "Giovinezza".
He was then head press officer of the PNF (1923-24), vicesegretario of the "Fasci italiani all'estero" (FIE) (1927) and vicedirector of the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution.
In 1934 he was made head of the General Directorate of Cinematography, the Fascist organisation controlling cinema. Freddi aimed to create an entertainment cinema on the American type, imitating the commercial Hollywood model instead of the Soviet propaganda model. The Cinecittà studios (of which he became a director) and the Centro sperimentale di cinematografia film school were founded under his direction.

Anton Batagov

Anton Batagov (born in Moscow, October 10, 1965) is a Russian pianist and post-minimalist composer.
Heralded as "one of the most significant and unusual figures of Russian contemporary music" (Newsweek, Russian edition, 1997) and "a Russian Terry Riley" (Los Angeles Times, 2008), Anton Batagov is one of the most influential Russian composers and performers of our time. The post-Cagean philosophy of Batagov's projects eliminates any boundaries between "performance" and "composition" by viewing all existing musical practices—from ancient rituals to rock and pop culture and advanced computer technologies—as potential elements of performance and composition.
Biography.
Russian post-minimalist composer and pianist Anton Batagov (b.10.10.1965) is one of the most influential Russian composers and performers of our time.
A graduate of the Gnessin School and the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory and prize-winner at the International Tchaikovsky Competition (1986) and other competitions, Batagov introduced the music by John Cage, Morton Feldman, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass to Russian audiences. His debut CD, a 160-minute recording of Olivier Messiaen's "Vingt regards sur l'Enfant Jesus" ("Melodiya", 1990, 3-CD set), became a major sensation. Three years later a well-known American musicologist Richard Kostelanetz characterized Batagov's 1993 recording of Bach's ""The Art of the Fugue"" as "the most stunning interpretation of Bach since Glenn Gould."
His concert appearances and recordings have consistently been defining moments discussed by a broad audience and the press. His interpretations of Bach, Schubert, Beethoven, Messiaen, Ravel, composers of the Russian avant-garde and those of the post avant-garde, distinguish themselves with expert knowledge of performing traditions and the history of culture. At the same time, they have radically changed habitual conceptions about these works, and even of the very foundations of musical art. The influences of Batagov's concert and studio work on the understanding of classical and new music and on the artistic tendencies in Russia has been tremendous.
Not only as a musician, but also as the artistic director of the legendary festival of contemporary music ""Alternativa"" (1989–1996), Anton Batagov was a principal influence on the broadening of the aesthetic horizon of the musical community, and on the meaning of musical practices in Russia.
In 1997 Batagov stopped performing live, and since then, he has been focusing on studio recordings. It is amazing, that as a musician who eschews the "mainstream" and "fashionable", and even abandons the stage à la Glenn Gould, Batagov nevertheless always appears at the centre of major artistic trends.
As a composer, Batagov began in the traditions of minimalism that in Russia has its own idiosyncrasies and unique history. He has been compared with the classics of American minimalism. He has fundamentally changed the character of new Russian music, which from a closed sphere has transformed into a more open space. The post-Cagean philosophy of Batagov's projects eliminates any boundaries between "performance" and "composition" by viewing all existing musical practices—from ancient rituals to rock and pop culture and advanced computer technologies—as potential elements of performance and composition. The post-minimalist language of Batagov's compositions is rooted in the harmonic and rhythmic patterns of Russian church bells and folk songs seamlessly mixed with the spirit of Buddhist philosophy, the dynamic pulse of early Soviet avant-garde, and the unfading appeal of progressive rock music. Batagov's works feature a unique sense of large-scale architecture and textured emotionalism. His discography includes over 30 CD releases.
Having begun to work in the sphere of film and television music, Batagov forced many to change their attitude to this field of art that is otherwise strictly reckoned as "applied". He is the author of several movie soundtracks, and over 3.000 tunes for the major Russian TV channels. He brought the depth and refined beauty of contemporary classics to the world of television music. His original style broke all the notions of what a TV music should sound like. It is enough to hear three seconds of his music to unmistakingly identify its author. He has composed a huge number of works but he never repeats himself. Every new composition has a unique melody and a unique atmosphere. Consciously or unconsciously, many other composers have been attempting to imitate his style.
Most of his works written since the late 1990s have been deeply influenced by Buddhist philosophy and practice. He has composed a number of major works based on a keystone Buddhist texts chanted by Tibetan lamas as well as several large-scale instrumental compositions inspired by Buddhist teachings.
Since the early 2000s, Anton Batagov has been seen not only as a successor of the post-minimalist tradition, but as a one-of-a-kind composer / musician / thinker. His multifaceted work and spiritual experience are unique. His views and principles are as unorthodox as they are clear and convincing.
In 2009 Anton Batagov received the prestigious national "Steppenwolf" Award in the Best Music category.
In 2009, after twelve years of seclusion, Batagov returned to live performances.
Style.
The post-minimalist language of Batagov's compositions is rooted in the harmonic and rhythmic patterns of Russian church bells and folk songs seamlessly mixed with the spirit of Buddhist philosophy, the dynamic pulse of early Soviet avant-garde, and the unfading appeal of rock music. Batagov's works feature a unique sense of large-scale architecture and textured emotionalism.

Throwball

Throwball is a non-contact ball sport played across a net between two teams of seven players on a rectangular court. Throwball is popular in Asia, especially on the Indian subcontinent, and was first played in India as a women's sport in Chennai during the 1940s. Like volleyball, the game's roots are linked with the YMCA. Both volleyball and newcomb ball, while older games, share many similarities with throwball. Throwball rules were first drafted in 1955 and India's first national level championship was played in 1980.
History.
According to the Throwball Federation of India, throwball is thought to have been drawn from a recreational sport popular among women in England and Australia during the 1930s. The YMCA brought the game to Chennai, where it was played as a women's sport in the 1940s. Harry Crowe Buck, who had founded the YMCA College of Physical Education in Chennai, drafted guidelines for throwball rules and regulations in 1955. The game reached Bangalore in the 1950s.
Ramanna, a sports enthusiast from Bangalore, organized a national level throwball championship in 1980. In 1985 the "Throwball Federation of India" (TFI) was formed along with the Indian National Throwball Championship and by 1990 throwball in India had become a sport for both men and women.
Rules and play.
The playing court is somewhat larger than a volleyball court at with a neutral box on either side of the centre. The height of the net is . The ball is similar to a volleyball but may be slightly larger. While in volleyball the ball is hit or "volleyed" throughout play, in throwball the ball is thrown over the net, where a member of the other team tries to catch the ball and quickly throw it back across the net.
An official game is played between two teams of seven players or nine players. A maximum of five substitute players is allowed for each team, which can make a maximum of five substitutions during a set. A team can take two time-outs of 30 seconds each during a set. The first team to score 25 points wins a set. A match is three sets.
Service is within five seconds after the referee whistles and is done from the "service zone", without crossing the "end line". A player can jump while serving the ball. The "service ball" must not touch the net. Double touch is not allowed for receiving the service ball and players stay in 3-1-3 position during the serve. 
During a rally, the ball must be caught at once with both hands, without any sound or movement of the ball within the hands ("dubs") and the player should have contact with the ground. Two players are not allowed to catch the ball simultaneously. The ball is thrown within three seconds after being caught, only from above the shoulder-line and only with one hand. A player can jump when throwing the ball, which can touch the net (but not the antenna). The player should have contact with the ground when catching the ball. However, the ball is not touched with any part of the body other than the palm when catching or throwing ("body touch"). The ball can neither be shifted (passed) to the left or right, nor deliberately pushed.
In official play, teams wear shorts and jersey uniform with numbers only in the range of 1-12 printed front and back.

Lapland Biosphere Reserve

Lapland Biosphere Reserve () is a zapovednik in Murmansk Oblast, Russia, beyond the Arctic Circle, occupying an area of 2,784 km² (1,075 sq mi) to the northwest of Lake Imandra, including 86 km² of inland water. Most of the territory is covered by northern taiga and montane tundra with the highest point on Mount Ebruchorr (1115 m a.s.l.).
The Lapland Nature Reserve was established in 1930. However, in 1951 along with many other zapovedniks of the Soviet Union it was abolished. It was reestablished in 1957, but in 1961-1965 was merged to Kandalaksha Nature Reserve. In 1983 the 1,613 km² area of the Lapland Nature Reserve was significantly expanded to include 1,296 km² of territories to the northwest, farther from the polluting influence of the Monchegorsk nickel smelter, and the zapovednik gave away 124 km² near the city. Since 1985 the zapovednik has been designated by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve.
The reserve has a subarctic climate (Köppen's Dfc). However, it is free of permafrost. The predominant tree species are "Pinus sylvestris" subsp. "lapponica", "Picea obovata", "Betula pendula", "B. pubescens" subsp. "subarctica" and "B. pubescens" subsp. "tortuosa". Among animals, wild reindeer has been the main subject to studies and protection.

Cipriano Efisio Oppo

Cipriano Efisio Oppo (1891, Rome – 1962, Rome) was an Italian painter.
Life.
Early life.
Trained at the Istituto di belle arti in Rome, he began his career as a caricaturist for "L’Idea Nazionale". From 1910 he devoted himself to painting, tending towards the "fauves", in particular Henri Matisse. In 1914 he contributed to the exhibition given by the Roman Secession. He then aligned himself with the national tradition.
Cultural organizer.
From the First World War onwards he tirelessly dedicated himself to organising Italian cultural and artistic life. As well as being a highly regarded art critic writing for Rome's "La Tribuna", his commitment led him to becoming an ambassador for art in public institutions. He became a deputy to Parliament and, in 1932, artistic director of the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution. He was then appointed secretary of the Direttorio Nazionale dei Sindacati delle Arti Plastiche (National Directorate of Unions of the Plastic Arts) and secretary of the Consiglio Superiore delle Belle Arti (Superior Council of Fine Arts). However, in this field, his most successful work was setting up the Quadriennale di Roma, born from one of his ideas and guided by him as its secretary-general over its first four shows from 1931 to 1943.
During the 1930s and 1940s, he believed he should abstain from exhibiting in Italy, precisely because of his political-administrative activity in the artistic field, not that this stopped his participating in several shows abroad, such as "L'art italien des XIX et XX siècles" (19th and 20th Century Italian Art) at the Jeu de Paume in Paris in 1935 and at the 1939 New York World's Fair.
Post-War.
Deemed free to return to the Quadriennale as an artist, in its 5th (1948) and 6th (1951) shows.
From 1949 to 1950, he was affiliated to the important collezione Verzocchi, as well as painting a self-portrait "La fiorista". The Verzocchi collection is now held at the Pinacoteca Civica of Forlì.

2004 Japan Series

The Japan Series, the 55th edition of Nippon Professional Baseball's championship series, began on October 16 and ended on October 25, and matched the Pacific League playoffs winner Seibu Lions against the Central League Champion, Chunichi Dragons.
Seibu Lions.
After an embarrassing sweep at the hands of the Yomiuri Giants in the 2002 Japan Series and losing out on the Pacific League pennant to the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks in 2003, the Lions were back in the Japan Series in 2004 thanks in no small part to the healthy arm of Daisuke Matsuzaka. Also helping the cause offensively was Venezuelan import Alex Cabrera, who hit a record-tying 55 home runs in 2004. Seibu had not won the Japan Series since 1992.
Chunichi Dragons.
Unlike the Lions, the Dragons had not had any success in winning the Japan Series since 1954, and this was their first appearance in the series since 1999, when they lost in 5 games to the Hawks. The Dragons pitching staff was led by Kenshin Kawakami and Masahiro Yamamoto, while Hitoki Iwase anchored the back of the bullpen. Offensively, the Dragons were led by Alex Ochoa and Kosuke Fukudome. In the middle of the infield, the Dragons were led by the amazing double-play tandem of Hirokazu Ibata and Masahiro Araki.
Game Summaries.
Game 1.
The first Japan Series game held in Nagoya Dome since Game 5 of the 1999 Japan Series turned out to be quite the close game, but the end result was the same: the Dragons were defeated by great pitching, this time from unheralded Takashi Ishii, who only won four games in the regular season. Chunichi had their ace on the mound in Kenshin Kawakami, who bounced back nicely from an injury-plagued 2003 season.
The two teams matched zeroes for the first three innings as Ishii struck out four and Kawakami ducked in and out of trouble. Jose Fernandez hit a two-out single in the first but was stranded there, and Kawakami left Kazuhiro Wada at third after he hit a leadoff triple, but Hiroyuki Nakajima and Kosuke Noda both grounded out, Hiroyuki Takagi drew an intentional walk to get to the pitcher Ishii, who struck out.
Wada would make sure he crossed the plate in his next at-bat. The fourth inning would also see the first run of the series on a towering home run to left field to give the Lions a 1-0 lead. That lead would be doubled in the next inning as Shogo Akada drove in Tomoaki Satoh with a single after Satoh doubled to lead off the inning.
The 2-0 lead would be enough for the Seibu pitching staff, as Ishii would work seven shutout innings, giving up just two hits and striking out six. Kiyoshi Toyoda worked a perfect 9th for the Lions to preserve the win. The shutout was also the third time in the last four home Japan Series games that Chunichi had been shut out, and it was the fourth time out of the last six overall.
Game 2.
This would be the first of a few wild games in this series. The Dragons finally ended their home playoff futility by winning their first playoff game at Nagoya Dome at the expense of Lions ace Matsuzaka. However, the game did not start well for the Dragons.
Pitching in his third Japan Series, wily veteran screwballer Masa Yamamoto was lit up for two runs in the first inning off the bat of Fernandez, who also drove in Satoh who led off the game with a single. The quick 2-0 lead was enough for Matsuzaka for the first two innings, but he ran into his first bit of trouble in the 3rd. 
Shogo Mori led off the inning with a single, and Yamamoto reached on a dropped third strike. Matsuzaka got himself into further trouble when he hit Masahiro Araki with a pitch to load the bases with nobody out. Hirokazu Ibata got a hit but saw Mori get gunned down at home. With the rally in trouble after Tatsunami grounded out, Alex Ochoa tied the game up with a two-run single to right. Matsuzaka made matters worse by plunking his second batter of the inning, this time Masahiko Morino, to re-load the bases. Finally, light-hitting catcher Motonobu Tanishige walked to force another run home and give Chunichi their first-ever lead at Nagoya Dome in the Japan series, 3-2.
Both Yamamoto and Matsuzaka would regain their composure in the following innings. Yamamoto struck out five batters between the 2nd and the 5th, and Dice-K only gave up one hit from the 4th to the 6th, striking out five in the process.
Seibu would chase Yamamoto and regain the lead in the 5th with a three-run barrage of their own. Takagi led the inning off with a single, then Satoh and Akada bot hit doubles to vault Seibu into the lead, 4-3. Eiji Ochiai came in to replace Yamamoto for the righty-on-righty matchup to Fernandez. After a sacrifice by Fernandez, the dangerous Cabrera was intentionally walked. Wada followed up the walk with a double that gave the Lions the 5-3 lead. Wada would double the Seibu advantage in the 7th with his second home run of the series, a shot that gave Seibu a seemingly safe 6-3 lead.
Then, Matsuzaka imploded. He was lit up for five runs in the 7th inning, with the rally having been started by pinch-hitter Takayuki Ohnishi. Araki lined out to right, but the rally truly began with Ibata's single to center. Tatsunami followed it up with three of his four RBIs on the day, as he hit his first home run of the series to right field, a three-run blast that tied the game at 6-6.
However, the Dragons weren't done. Ochoa drew a walk and Morino was plunked for the second time on the day, and Tanishige got in on the fun by singling home Ochoa to give the Dragons the 7-6 lead. Pinch-hitter Mitsunobu Takahashi then singled home another run to finish Matsuzaka's day and give Chunichi an 8-6 lead.
The Dragons would add three more in the 9th off Shinji Mori. Ibata collected his fourth hit of the day, stole second, and was driven home by Tatsunami. After Ochoa reached again, an RBI triple and another Tanishige RBI single ended the scoring with an 11-6 win for the Dragons. With the series going back to Seibu Dome for the next three, the Dragons were tied. They had beaten Seibu's best in Matsuzaka. Could they keep the ball rolling and win their first Japan Series since 1954?
Game 3.
In what was one of the wildest games in Japan Series history, Game 3 was also the first time in Japan Series history that two grand slams were hit in the same game. Kazuyuki Hoashi faced off against Domingo Guzman for the starting pitching matchup. The first three innings were a scoreless deadlock, with Chunichi having only one hit to their credit, and Seibu having no hits.
The fourth inning saw the first runs of the game, as the potent Seibu bats once again came alive, and the feared slugger Alex Cabrera finally came to life himself. Satoh and Fernandez both singled their way on, and then Cabrera launched his first home run of the series to give Seibu the 3-0 lead.
Hoashi would make it stand up, and he got another run in support of him in the 4th when young shortstop Hiroyuki Nakajima clubbed his first home run of the series. However, he ran into trouble in the 6th: trouble that would give the Dragons a 5-4 lead. The rally started when Nakajima muffed a ground ball. After Hoashi got the first out of the inning, Tatsunami and Ochoa both singled their way on to load the bases, and Takahashi drew a walk to force in one run. Hoashi was taken out and replaced by Shuichiro Osada, who faced Tanishige as his first batter. Tanishige took a 3-1 inside fastball and crushed it down the line in left for his first career grand slam. All of a sudden, the Lions were trailing 5-4.
With Guzman out of the game after five innings, Shinya Okamoto took over. He preserved the Dragons lead, and his teammates got him another run in the 6th when Ochoa got a bases-loaded RBI single to give the Dragons a 6-4 lead. However, the 7th truly was the lucky inning for the Lions, as Okamoto suffered an implosion of his own, similar to Matsuzaka's in the previous game.
With one out, Nakajima singled his way on, Yoshihito Ishii walked, and Takagi was hit by a pitch. Satoh doubled Nakajima and Ishii in to tie the game up at 6. At this point, conventional wisdom would say that Okamoto should have been relieved, but he was allowed to continue. Akada grounded out, and Fernandez walked. With two down, the game was hanging in the balance as Okamoto pitched to Cabrera, even though it was only the 7th inning. Cabrera responded with a towering home run to left on a 1-1 pitch that was hit out of Seibu Dome. It was Cabrera's second home run of the day, and it was also the second grand slam of the day in total. The slam gave Seibu a 10-6 lead going into the 8th.
Chunichi would not go quietly though. Against Koji Ohnuma, Omar Linares got in on the home run derby by leading off with a home run to the back screen in center to pull the Dragons to within 10-7. Morino followed it up with a double, and he came around to score on two groundouts for a 10-8 score. However, Toyoda would not let the Dragons get any closer in the 9th, as he stuck out two batters in the 9th to record the save and give Seibu a 2-1 series lead.

Chitpavani Konkani

Chitpavani is a dialect of the Konkani language as spoken by the Chitpavan community. Chitpavans, as they are known today, evolved as a community in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra, India. This region lies on the western coast of the country. From their original land of Ratnagiri, they have spread to many parts of the world.
Chitpavans speak a peculiar dialect called Chitpavani, which was spoken in the district until the 1950s, but as time went on, people adopted Marathi as their language. As of now, this language is almost extinct from the Konkan region, with the exception of a very few old people in some remote villages in the district who can still speak this dialect. Chitpavans who migrated to Goa and the Dakshin Kannada district of Karnataka about 300 years ago have still maintained Chitpavani language in their homes.
Chitpavani is classified as a dialect of the Konkani- Goan language and is a transitional dialect between Konkani (spoken in North Konkan) and Konkani Goan.
Nowadays efforts are being made to revive this language through various forums such as internet groups on Orkut, Yahoo and also through various Chitpavan Mandals in Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka.

Bracebridge, Nottinghamshire

Bracebridge is an undefined area of Worksop in Nottinghamshire, lying between Manton to the south, and Kilton to the north, lying on the Chesterfield Canal and the riverRyton, close to a point where the river is crossed-over by the canal. The area takes its name from the Georgian Bridge, which crosses the canal, which was achieved by "bracing" the stonework with iron, achieving a wide single-span. Immediately around this bridge is the core of old Bracebridge, which was created to serve the canal, and is the site of a lock. The bridge is the original route of the B6041, before a new road was built some 200 yards East, to avoid congestion, on the narrow Bracebridge. This original stretch of road is now a cul-de-sac, having been bollarded at the south end close to the bridge over the Ryton. 
To the west of old Bracebridge, further along the Chesterfield Canal, most of Bracebridge consists of modern housing. However, much of the surrounding area around consists of open wasteland and farmland left behind by the building of the new B6041 road, and the industrial buildings of Manton.
Lying east of the new B6041 is a former pumping station, built of brick, in a pseudo French Baroque style complete with sloping roof.

1994 Japan Series

The 1994 Japan Series was the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) championship series for the 1994 season. It was the 45th Japan Series and featured the Pacific League champion Seibu Lions against the Central League champion Yomiuri Giants. The series was the eighth time the two franchises played each other for the championship.
Because this year's edition of the Japan Series took place during the Major League Baseball strike that scuttled the entire postseason, including the World Series, it received much more attention than normal in the United States. Most memorably, the cover of the October 31 issue of "Sports Illustrated" featured Lions pitcher Hisanobu Watanabe along with the tagline "The World's Series", in the Lions' 11-0 win in Game One. Chicago-area Regional Sports Networks broadcast the game in English on a week delay basis, with Ken Harrelson being the lead broadcaster. This resulted eventually in Major League Baseball acquiring Japanese players upon the end of the strike.
Two members of the winning Yomiuri Giants team -- Hideki Matsui (2009) and Dan Gladden (1987, 1991) -- also won a World Series.
This was the first Japan Series to feature night games, and the first with a reduction in extra innings. The Series, which had an 18-inning limit before a tie game, adopted a 15-inning limit before Series games were tied.

Kevin Sampson (writer)

Kevin Sampson is a British novelist, best known for his novels "Awaydays" (1998), "Powder" (1999) and "Stars Are Stars" (2006). He lives in Birkenhead, Merseyside. His crime thriller, "The Killing Pool", was published by Cape on 21 March 2013.
Career.
Sampson began writing gig reviews for NME in the 80s, though was famously sacked by Editor Neil Spencer for reviewing a Sex Gang Children concert at a Liverpool club that had been burned down on the night the band had been due to appear. He went on to contribute regularly to The Face, Arena, i-D, Sounds, Jamming, The Observer and Time Out before joining Channel Four as an Assistant Editor for Youth Programmes.
He left C4 to set up Kinesis Films, a company that specialised in documentaries about subcultures (notably "Sole of the Nation", a film about Dr. Martens boots, and "Ibiza - A Short Film About Chilling.") Sampson returned to Merseyside in 1990 to help long-time friend Peter Hooton set up Produce Records with partners Ian Croft, Wayne Chand, Barney Moores and Paul McKenna. Produce enjoyed a string of Top 40 hits in the early 90s, including The Farm's "Groovy Train" and "All Together Now."
When The Farm broke up in 1994, Sampson dug out the manuscript to a novella he had sent to Penguin in 1982. "Awaydays" was based on what he saw during his youth, travelling to, and at, football grounds up and down the country. Inspired by Irvine Welsh's phenomenal debut "Trainspotting", Sampson re-worked the novel, which was acquired by publisher Dan Franklin at Jonathan Cape. "Awaydays" was an immediate critical and commercial success on its release in 1998. Sampson's second novel, "Powder", reflects some of his experiences of the music business with The Farm and Produce Records, and subsequent adventures in Ibiza, and working for Richard Branson's V2 Music.
"Awaydays" was adapted to film in 2009. He writes about his involvement in the Ibiza film, A Short Film About Chilling in the Summer 2010 Umbrella Magazine's Issue 1 and a film version of "Powder" was released August 2011. "Surveillance", a film from one of Sampson's original screenplays, was in competition at the Berlinale's "Panaroma" section in 2008, and his forthcoming crime thriller "Gangsterland" is under option with Red Union Films.

The Real Son

The Real Son is a short movie, in which Lucas Grabeel plays Freddie Deansman, the rebellious son of a golf player (Mark L. Taylor) who cares more about fixing the golf club's fastest printer than about his son. On Father's Day, Mr Deansman competes in a golf tournament with a friend's son, leaving Freddie to his own devices. At the end of the day, Mr Deansman takes home the printer and goes to pick up Freddie. Their awkward conversation betrays the communication gap between the two. this disconnection is underlined by the revelation that Mr Deansman has been pushing for Freddie to join the Navy. In contrast, Freddie aims to go to art school, his artistic nature revealed through his labelling of the printer as 'The Real Son' in red ink. Just as the two are reaching a reconciliation, with Freddie confiding to his father his plans for an art piece, Mr Deansman interrupts his son and begins again to praise the printer's speed. It is clear that there has been no change in the father-son relationship. The film lasts almost 9 minutes.
Trivia.
The Real Son was filmed in one day, on the set of High School Musical 2 in which Lucas Grabeel plays Ryan Evans and Mark L. Taylor plays Mr Fulton.

Israel–Serbia relations

Israel–Serbia relations are foreign relations between Israel and Serbia. Israel has an embassy in Belgrade and Serbia has an embassy in Tel Aviv.
History.
All diplomatic relations between Israel and Yugoslavia ceased to exist following the Six-Day War in 1967 until they were renewed on January 31, 1992 during the Yugoslav Wars.
The Jewish community of Belgrade.
Ever since the 13th century there has been a recorded Jewish community of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews in the city of Belgrade. The first Jews to settle in the city originally arrived from Italy and the city of Dubrovnik, and later on from Hungary and Spain.
The Jewish community developed substantially before and after World War I following the religious autonomy they have received, and many Jewish educational institutions and synagogues for both the Ashkenazi and Sephardic communities were established. By the year 1939 there were approximately 10,400 Jews living in Belgrade. 
In the Kosovo region, between the first and second world war, approximately 500 Jews lived in the cities of Pristina, Mitrovica and Kosovska. 
Most of the Jews living in Serbia and Montenegro were also killed during the Holocaust and most of those who survived emigrated to Israel. During the war many Jews were given refuge by the Yugoslav Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito, and many of them fought along their side. 
Today there are approximately 1,700 Jews in Serbia and Montenegro, mainly in Serbia's capital city of Belgrade.
Political relations.
The issue of Kosovo and the Palestinian Territories.
Israel does not recognise Kosovo's independence as a sovereign state. This decision is regarded in part due to the possibility of the Palestinian Authority using such a recognition to justify their own unilateral declaration of independence. However, In 2011 Serbia voted to recognize Palestine as UNESCO's 195th member, against Israel's wishes. Belgrade declared that it would not have opposed a resolution recognizing Palestinian sovereignty, had one come before the UN General Assembly.
On April 28, 2009, Arthur Koll, the Israeli ambassador to Serbia, said that though it had been more than a year since Kosovo unilaterally declared independence, Israel had no intention of recognising the declaration, and that "Israel is asked from time to time how solid this decision is, but the fact is that Israel's position has not changed throughout this time. The Serbian people and government should appreciate Israel's position, which also demonstrates the friendship between the two states.". In September 2009, during an official visit to Belgrade, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman also reaffirmed that Israel would not recognise Kosovo, but hoped the issue would be resolved peacefully.
Economic ties.
Economic ties between Israel and Serbia have been rapidly expanding since 2009, in part due to the abolition of visa restrictions between the two countries in September of that year. On February 1, 2012, Serbian president Boris Tadić noted during a ceremony marking 20 years to the renewal of diplomatic ties that Israeli companies have invested more than a billion euros in infrastructures in Serbia.
In October 2009, Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dačić paid a visit to Israel, during which an agreement was signed between the two governments on cooperation in the fight against crime, illegal trade and abuse of narcotics and psychoactive substances, terrorism and other serious criminal acts.
Tourism.
Since the abolition of visa restrictions between the two countries in September 2009, the State of Israel has been promoting Serbian tourism to Israel through the Israeli embassy in Belgrade. These efforts include annual advertisements on billboards and public buses in Belgrade presenting Israel as a sea & sun summer destination under the title "Oseti Izrael" ("Feel Israel"). In 2011 the Israeli embassy initiated a tourism campaign titled "Ja volim Tel Aviv" ("I Love Tel-Aviv"), which included the construction of a "beach" in Novi Sad meant to simulate a typical beach in the Israeli city of Tel-Aviv and be used as a venue for parties and different activities promoting tourism to Israel. According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, during 2011 4,700 Serbians visited Israel as tourists, compared to 3,000 in 2010 and 1,400 in 2009.

Croatia–Serbia relations

Croatian-Serbian relations are foreign relations between Croatia and Serbia. From 1918 to 1991, both countries were part of Yugoslavia. They now share 241 kilometers of common border. In the 2011 Croatian census, there were 186,633 people of Serbian descent living in Croatia. In the 2011 Serbian census, there were 57,900 people of Croatian descent living in Serbia. Lasting disputes and controversies include the Croatia–Serbia genocide case, which could cost the charged (if given a guilty verdict) state a crippling multi-billion dollar fine for almost all reparation costs of the war in the 1990s. Other smaller lasting disputes include border disputes over the Island of Šarengrad and the Island of Vukovar.
History.
World War II.
During World War II, present-day Croatia was governed by the pro-Axis Ustaša government, which sought to ethnically cleanse Serbs from all territories controlled by the Independent State of Croatia. Following the victory of Yugoslav Partisans on the Yugoslav Front, the Ustaša and the Chetniks were eliminated and both countries became part of SFR Yugoslavia.
War of independence.
The period of 1991 to 1995 marked the Croatian War of Independence. A self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina, created as a nation state for ethnic Serbs living on Croatian territory, was occupied by the remnants of the Yugoslav People's Army (from Serbia and Montenegro) from 1991 to 1992 and was supported by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia through military support. The reason for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to support the Republic of Serbian Krajina against Croatian forces were due to common interests in upholding the status quo of keeping ethnic Serbs of former Yugoslav territories united, either within the extant Yugoslav state or as satellite states serving as proxies to Belgrade.
Post-war relations.
After the end of the Croatian War of Independence, the two countries established diplomatic relations on September 9, 1996. Croatia filed a genocide lawsuit against Serbia at the International Court of Justice in 1999, and after Zagreb declined requests to withdraw it, Belgrade filed a countersuit in 2010. Croatia has an embassy in Belgrade and a general consulate in Subotica. Serbia has an embassy in Zagreb and two general consulates, one in Rijeka and one in Vukovar.
Border dispute.
Due to the meandering of the Danube, the eastern border of Baranja with Serbia according to cadastral delineation is not followed, as each country controls territory on their side of the main river flow.
Further south, near Vukovar and near Šarengrad, there are two river islands (Vukovarska ada and Šarengradska ada) which have been part of SR Croatia (during Yugoslavia) but during the war they came under Serbian control.
Croatia is asking that the islands be returned because of the Badinter Arbitration Committee decision from 1991 that all internal borders between Yugoslav republics have become international. Serbia's position is that the natural border between the countries is the middle of the main flow of Danube, which would make the islands Serbian territory. Military occupation of the islands ended recently after an incident in which Serbian military opened fire and arrested the mayor of Vukovar Vladimir Štengel with 19 other Croatian civilians and 8 children who were going to visit Zvezdan Kisić, the mayor of the Serbian town Bačka Palanka. These islands are now under Serbian police control.
Consulate General of Serbia in Vukovar.
Serbia established a diplomatic mission in Vukovar, Croatia on 5 February 1998, twenty days after the end of the reintegration process of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia into Croatia, which was the end of the Croatian War of Independence. The consulate is responsible for five Slavonian counties: Vukovar-Syrmia County, Osijek-Baranja, Brod-Posavina, Požega-Slavonia and Virovitica-Podravina county.
Due to the huge interest of local citizens, in the beginning consulate operated also in Beli Manastir. The consulate is at the end of the war played a very positive role in the life of the local Serbian minority in the city and region.
Representatives of the consulate are frequent interlocutors of local and national media when it comes to issues of protection and promotion of Serbian identity in the Danube region. Consulate organizes and participates in various cultural and educational projects and humanitarian actions, some of which are: celebration of the signing of Erdut Agreement, showing of documentary films, donation of equipment, organizing concerts etc.
On the occasion of 150 anniversary of the birth of Nikola Tesla, consulate was, in conjunction with the U.S. Embassy in Zagreb, co-financed Days of Nikola Tesla in Osijek.
Over time the consulate achieved close cooperation with minority institutions and organizations such as Joint Council of Municipalities, Eparchy of Osječko polje and Baranja, and Radio Borovo.
International organizations.
Both countries are full members of the Southeast European Cooperation Process, of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, of the Central European Initiative, of the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative and of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.
Popular culture.
Rivalry in basketball.
A big rivalry in basketball started since the first important big match within the European Championships just after the split of Yugoslavia. Croats were leading by two and there were only four seconds left; Serbian Sasa Djordjevic took the ball and made a three-pointer making Serbia win the game and then successively become the European Champion.
Afterward, on Euro championship 2001, Croats were hardly beaten by 88:60. Last match on big competitions was World championship 2010, were Serbia also won 73:72.
This rivalry went on also to clubs. Serbian clubs dominate in regional league, where they won nine times (Partizan eight times), and Croatian club won only one title. Particularly at the final game of the regional ABA league with Partizan from Serbia and Cibona from Croatia. This time the Croats were leading just 0.6 seconds before the end of the game. When all seemed finished, the serb from Partizan, Kecman, took the ball and made it from the other side. The Serbian team won again.
Rivalry in football.
Rivalries between Croatian and Serbian football contenders became especially famous to the world in the early 1990s, starting with the historic Dinamo Zagreb–Red Star Belgrade riot, which emphasized in some peoples' eyes the breakup of Yugoslavia. The Croatian national football team and the Yugoslav national football team played on only a few occasions—the first being in 1999 for UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying Group 8. Nevertheless, the rivalry between the two teams has been described as one of fiercest in the world. Fourteen years later, for the first time in history, Serbia as an independent country played national team against the Croatian team on March 22, 2013 in qualification group A of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The match, which Croatia won 2-0, was closely followed around the world. The football federations of Serbia and Croatia agreed to ban foreign guests fans at the two games because of security concerns.

<doc id="20081820" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20081820" title="Tasmanian A-League Bid">
Tasmanian A-League Bid

The Tasmanian A-League Bid, under the working name of Tasmania United FC, is a proposed Tasmania-based A-League association football (soccer) club. In late 2010 a business plan was developed investigating the feasibility of such a proposal, however at the media release of the bid, where Tasmania United FC officials were absent, the State Government and Football Federation Tasmania made it clear that any such bid would be run by the State Government and not by any third party. The State Government then concluded that they had no interest in supporting such a proposal and would prefer to invest in youth development and encouraging state visits of other A-league clubs. Tasmania United FC officials have stated that they will press on without assistance from the State Government and Football Federation Tasmania, no further comment to the media has been made.
History.
Tasmanian Football Taskforce.
Following the success of the A-League, a Tasmanian football task force headed by Hobart-based businessman John McGirr has been given the task of finding funding for a Tasmanian-based A-League side. The taskforce has registered the name "Tasmania United FC" and is submitting a bid for the 2011-12 season. In September 2008 McGirr Announced the adoption of an official club logo for the proposed club and announced that the taskforce was on target "to present an extremely strong business case to both FFA and the Tasmanian community and intend to be ready to put a formal proposal for an A-League licence by mid-2009". Tasmanian Football Taskforce official Ken Morton has stated that should Tasmania United FC be awarded an A-League licence then the competition would become "a far more 'national' competition than rivals AFL and NRL, which are based in Melbourne and Sydney respectively. Indeed, the AFL has consistently refused Tasmania's push to have its own team, with economic factors being brought into play. "We have a good cricket team down there who compete well at national level and we believe we can do the same in the A-League." In February 2008, Ken Morton stated "we meet the criteria but we require an owner."
Proposal.
In October 2007, Football Federation Tasmania CEO Martin Shaw suggested that Tasmania would be a viable location for an A-League club. It was further suggested, in something of a contradiction, that a Tasmanian team would require Tasmanian Government support. On the 16th March, 2009 the Tasmanian Football Taskforce Chairman John McGirr clarified this statement by pointing out that "Obviously as a task force we would welcome any sort of funding from whoever," John McGirr then added "from day one we have seen this as a private business enterprise and we are not looking for any Government funds to prop the bid up".
Public launch.
The Tasmanian task force, which has the backing of the state government, has scheduled the launch of Tasmania United FC for November 25, and that a deal with a major sponsor is close at hand. Ken Morton states that "we had good news regarding the major investor and once that is finalised in the next few days I think you will see our bid progress very aggressively."
Early planning.
On the 12th of February 2009 the task force announced it was "still in the mix" and "working harder than ever of late to entice investors and sponsors, as well as being in regular contact with the FFA". The Taskforce was unable to complete a formal propasal in time for the early expansion, although the Taskforce continued operating with the intention of obtaining a future A-league licence. Ken Morton has since stated that he believes Tasmania United FC's chance of entering the A-League to be "100%. I believe the A-League want us, the Tasmanian community want us and for this reason I believe it will become reality."
On the 16th March, 2009 Chairman John McGirr stated that the task force was in negotiation with a Dubai businessman regarding sponsorship and ownership of Tasmania United FC. The businessman has since been named as Sheik Mohammed Hussein Ali Al Amoudi—the 77th richest man in the world with a net worth of $13.7 billion. As at December 2010 it is unknown if Sheik Mohammed Hussein Ali Al Amoudi has any involvement with the consortium.
2009 Club feasibility study.
On the 22 April 2009 the Tasmanian Government launched a six-week feasibility study to determine the possibility of a Tasmanian A-League side being viable. Stratcorp Consulting and Sporting Management Concepts, the same business to successfully manage the Melbourne Heart A-League licence bid have been engaged to manage the study utilising their experience in this field. 
The outcome was a final Report that considered the key issues and questions that decision makers and potential funding partners may have in relation to the need for the proposed A-League team.
The Report was aimed at exciting key Ministers and Government staff about the opportunities to establish the team and provide sufficient need and justification to enable Government commitment.
This feasibility study succeeded in obtaining State Government and FFA support and shortly after its review the State Government agreed to provide funding towards the preparation of a Business Plan.
2010 Club business plan.
With the positive feedback obtained from the completed feasibility study, the taskforce obtained funding from the Tasmanian State Government to cover those costs associated with the preparation of a business plan that could be made available to both investors and the FFA. The business plan was completed successfully in late December 2010, with the consortium stating that it would be making a presentation to both the FFA and key investors in early to mid-2011 with the express intention of winning the now vacant 11th A-league licence for the 2012-2013 Season along with gaining crucial private investment. There is unknown if Sheik Mohammed Hussein Ali Al Amoudi—the 77th richest man in the world, may be one of these potential investors.
Early in 2011 the results of the business plan were released to the public by Tasmania United FC and these demonstrated that Tasmania could hold an A-league licence.
2011 Tasmanian bid schism.
Shortly after the business plan was released to the public the current state government made a media release alongside representatives of Football Federation Tasmania, who had no involvement with Tasmania United FC or a Tasmanian bid until that point, and with no members of the Tasmania United FC board present. At the media release the State Government stated that they would not be pursuing any bid and that if they were to do so in the future then they would utilise a business model where Football Federation Tasmania controlled all aspects of the bid and club. A short time afterwards the board of Tasmania United FC who had laid the foundation stated that they would continue to press for a future Tasmanian A-League licence that worked with the State Government and Football Federation Tasmania, though as a wholly independent body.
Home base.
Despite a growing national interest Supporters of a Tasmanian A-League club are still divided over the location of home games with both the north and south ends of the state supporting home games being played in their own region. The two supporter groups are focused on either Hobart or Launceston. Both cities contain sporting venues; Bellerive Oval in Hobart and Aurora Stadium in Launceston, but both are oval designs and would be far from ideal. In spite of these concerns the Tasmanian A-league Taskforce have inconsultation with the FFA implemented a policy directed towards delivering one A-League Club for all Tasmanians playing home games in both the north and south of the state. This has resulted in considerable frustration for some football fans in both the north and south of the state who believe that football should be solely located in their region only.
Potential alternate grounds.
Given that the future establishment of a 20/20 League in Australia may prevent the use of Bellerive stadium for A-League matches, other facilities have been suggested including the redevelopment of King George V Oval, North Hobart Oval, Wentworth Park or Rugby Park, along with the possible complete development of an entirely new sporting precinct somewhere in the Greater Hobart region. These possibilities are all reliant upon potential investment from third parties.
Many potential supporters of A-League in Tasmania have encouraged the redevelopment of North Hobart Oval as Tasmania's premier association rules and rugby field in Tasmania. 
Other grounds that may be suitable for friendly matches include both the Devonport Oval and West Park in Burnie, as a Tasmanian A-league side will no doubt want a presence on the North West Coast of the state, if only in friendly matches.
Squad.
Although there are no plans to sign players until the granting of an A-League licence, Ken Morton stated that he already has in mind "2 Dutch Under 21 stars who I think would do very well and they would be great acquisitions for the A-League. Both played in Under 21 European Championships for Holland." However with a delay to submission of the bid these acquisitions did not eventuate.
While no firm decisions have been made Ken states that he is establishing scouting networks "through existing scouts in Brazil, the UK and Asia." and intends to look at recruiting both locally and from "Asia, Africa and Europe." When asked if he would be prepared to apply for the senior coach position once an A-League licence was granted, Ken Morton stated "Yes, without a doubt."
National Youth League squad.
Following the successful friendly matches played between a Tasmanian Youth Side and National Youth League squads Ken Morton has stated that "given a chance our youngsters can compete at this level" and that "the passion shown by these boys was tremendous."
Club culture.
It has been decided that Tasmania United FC will be a club with a nickname that represents all Tasmanians. Many oppose using the name 'Tigers' as the state cricket team already has this nickname. For similar reasons the name 'Tassie Devils' may also be excluded as the former Tasmanian VFL side used this name and there is the expectation that it will be the name of a future Tasmanian-based AFL side.
The Taskforce has obtained supporter opinion of the names Wolves, Apples, Lions, Convicts, Pirates and Islanders and several others through the use of website polling. Another suggestion was The Wanderers due to the famous overland walking track, however this title is now taken. No firm decisions have been made although Wolves remains a highly popular choice making use of the thylacines name 'native marsupial wolf'.

Romania–Serbia relations

Romanian–Serbian relations are foreign relations between Romania and Serbia. Both countries established diplomatic relations on April 19, 1841.
Although Serbia unofficially opened a kind of diplomatic agency in Bucharest in March 1836, officially, the first Serbian diplomatic agency in Bucharest was established in February 1863, with Kosta Magazinovic, as its first diplomatic agent. Reciprocally the first Romanian diplomatic agency in Belgrade was established on 12/24 March 1863 and the first diplomatic agent was Teodor Calimachi.
In 1879, as a consequence of the independent state status, the diplomatic agencies from Belgrade and Bucharest became legations and the diplomatic agents, resident ministers. Thus on 14/26 April 1879 the Romanian diplomatic agency in Belgrade became legation, having Lascăr Catargiu as its first resident minister. In the summer of 1879 Milan A. Petronijevic became Serbia's first resident minister in Romania. Later, after Romania and Serbia became kingdoms, in 1881 and 1882, their diplomatic representatives became "extraordinary envoy and plenipotentiary ministers". It was only in 1939 when the legations from Belgrade and Bucharest became embassies.
Nowadays Romania has an embassy in Belgrade, a general consulate in Vršac. Serbia has an embassy in Bucharest, a general consulate in Timişoara. There are around 22,500 people of Serbian descent living in Romania and around 74,000 Romanians living in Serbia.
Both countries are full members of the Southeast European Cooperation Process, of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, of the Central European Initiative, of the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative and of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. Both countries are strongly against Kosovo independence. Romania has strongly supported Serbia's territorial integrity.

Wearable augmented task-list interchange device

Wearable Augmented task-List Interchange Device (W.A.L.I.D) system was designed by computing researchers of the wearable computing group at the University of Oregon as a simulator to test wearable communities projects. The first version was used in testing the Negotiation System described in When Cyborgs Meet: Building Communities of Cooperating Wearable Agents, and as described in Modeling Wearable Negotiation in an Opportunistic Task Oriented Domain. The WALID simulator is also modified for the trust domain.
The experimental system of WALID is developed to test the weighing of trust versus self-interest. The experiment is made easy by the fact that Oregon computing researchers live and worked in the same neighbourhood in Eugene, Oregon.
In this experiment, two individuals use their mobile devices to negotiate about and to exchange real world tasks such as dropping off someone's dry cleaning of returning a book to the library. It is based on the ideal of "doing a favour for others knowing that one day they will do it for you".
The WALID system utilizes personal agent software to find nearby community members within close proximity to negotiate the exchange of tasks. Agents are made aware of the activities of the tasks and their locations via a user's task list. When an encounter occurs, negotiation is made and the tasks are exchanged if the negotiation goes through.

Micromorph

The artificial word micromorph is a combination of the words MICROcrystalline and aMORPHous. It is used for a type of thin-film silicon multijunction solar cell.
The micromorph cell.
In this Multijunction photovoltaic cell the top cell, consisting of a thin amorphous silicon layer, absorbing the blue light and a thicker microcrystalline silicon bottom cell absorbing the red and near-infrared light of the solar spectrum. 
Since the bandgaps of amorphous Silicon (1.7eV) and microcrystalline Silicon (1.1eV) are well suited for tandem solar cells, the Shockley-Queisser limit of this cell allows conversion efficiencies of over 30%. 
In reality this limit can not be reached and typical stable efficiencies are about 9% (world record 11.7%). That is well over the stable efficiencies of single junction thin film silicon solar cells which are around 6%. One reason of the low costs of silicon thin film solar cells is its very low thickness (2 µm) compared to silicon wafer (200 µm). In the red and infrared wavelength range 2 µm of silicon are not enough to absorb all light and therefore Light trapping is needed. 
The advantage of the micromorph approach is that it keeps the thickness of the amorphous top cell low. This reduces the effect of degradation induced by light (Staebler-Wronski effect). 
In multijunction cells top and bottom cell have to produce the same current. But the top cell is limited by the Staebler-Wronski effect and therefore Light trapping and an intermediate reflector are needed to keep the thickness of the top cell low while increasing its current.
The intermediate reflector.
The intermediate reflector is a layer (IRL) of Zinc oxide (ZnO intermediate reflector: ZIR) or Silicon oxide (SiOx intermediate reflector: SOIR) between the top and the bottom cell. Due to its lower refractive index of around 2 comparing to the surrounding silicon (4) light is reflected back into the top cell. This increases the top cell current from around 10mA/cm^2 to 12mA/cm^2, but reduces the bottom cell current by an equal amount.
The word micromorph.
This artificial word has first been mentioned in a scientific publication of the University of Neuchâtel research group of Prof. Arvind Shah by the author J. Meier in the year 1995 , but is based on long pioneering research of several authors and of several years. For a detailed list of publications, see the two main research group's publications website under http://pvlab.epfl.ch and under http://www.fz-juelich.de/ief/ief-5/publicger/
Years later, other European, Japanese and American research groups started research activities in the field of improving the conversion efficiency of thin-film silicon solar cells by utilizing the stacked solar cell concept, naming the micromorph device 'hybrid' solar cell or naming the microcrystalline silicon absorber 'nanocrystalline' or even 'policrystalline' silicon.
The word 'micromorph' has been lately claimed to belong to a equipment manufacturer of silicon coating tools, but in a patent judgement, this claim has not been accepted by European patent offices .

Poland–Serbia relations

Polish-Serbian relations are foreign relations between Poland and Serbia. Diplomatic relations have been maintained since Poland and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes established them in 1919. Poland has an embassy in Belgrade. Serbia has an embassy in Warsaw. Poland and Serbia in the past have had traditionally friendly relations.
History.
The Poles and Serbs are Slavs. The Poles belong to the West Slavic group, the Serbs to the South Slavic. As having origin in the Proto-Slavs, the two were pagan (Slavic religion) until forming of Christianity as state-religion; 867–886 in Serbia with the baptism of Mutimir (possibly by Eastern Christian Cyril and Methodius), and 966 in Poland with the baptism of Mieszko I (by Western Christian Jordan).
The cultural ties and common origin are predominate factors in the relations.
Middle Ages.
White Serbs.
According to Eastern Roman Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, Serbs "came from White Serbia". The location of White Serbia has not precisely been determined, however, the most likely - a eponymous connection with the Sorbs ("Serby") of Lusatia (a region of Poland, Czech Republic and Germany).
Royal connections.
Jadwiga of Poland was part Serbian, having descendance of the Nemanjić dynasty, through Stephen Dragutin of Serbia.
Wars against the Ottoman Empire.
In the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the Christian army led by Prince Lazar included a number of Polish and Hungarian knights.
There were Serbian guslars (players of gusle) in the year 1415 at the royal court of the Polish king Władysław Jagiełło.
Polish knight Zawisza Czarny was captured by Turkish commander Sinan Bey near the Golubac fortress, in Serbia, around April 1428.
In the Battle of Niš in 1443, Władysław III of Poland fought alongside Đurađ Branković.
Hussars.
The Hussars was a light cavalry of European armies, originating in the Serbian concept; of exiled Serbian warriors leaving Ottoman occupied Serbia. The Polish Hussars, first mentioned in 1500 (Racowie, "of Rascia") were Serbs.
Revolutions and Principality of Serbia.
After the Polish November Uprising in 1830-31, Polish revolutionaries fled to Serbia. Ilija Garashanin made contact with the Polish emgigrees.
A Polish, "Prince" Adam Czartoryski, founded the "Nachertanije"-project of Greater Serbia.
The great Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz (l. 1798–1855) thought highly of Serb epic poetry, and chose it as a theme of lectures at Collège de France.
The Serbs and Poles were part of the Sokol organizations.
World War I.
In March 1914, Serbian, French, Polish and Greek allied troops landed at Odessa.
In the early fall of 1918, an allied account said that Serbs and Poles in a region from Urals to Volga had been recruited by a French officer.
In 1918, Serbs and Poles together with Chinese, were part of the "Officer's Corps", a unit of the Russian Consul at Harbin.
World War II.
Poles joined the Yugoslav Partisans with the beginning of the War, as well as the Chetniks. In the mountains of Serbia in the years 1942–1943 there were three other Polish partisan companies attached to the Chetnik Corps.
The "Rules of Chetnik Warfare" was first published in Polish, then translated into Serbian.
On June 1, 1944, a Balkan Air Force was established by the British. It had mostly British, but also Italian, a Yugoslav squadron, and a Polish flight.
Politics.
Kosovo.
Polish opinion on the NATO operations in Kosovo was mixed: 37% favoured involvement while 43% were against. The government decided in favor of a NATO-led operation to bring cease-fire in the conflict.
Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 17 February 2008 and Poland recognized it on 26 February 2008. Poland was the first Slavic country to do so.
In September 2008, President of Poland, Lech Kaczyński, stated that the original cause of the 2008 South Ossetia war was not the Georgian operation, but the recognition of Kosovo's independence and that he would block attempts to establish diplomatic relations of Poland with Kosovo at ambassadorial level; however, the government has not proposed to send an ambassador to Pristina.
The recognition of Kosovo Albanian independence has been criticized in Poland. Dozens of protests and demonstrations have been organized by various groups in Poland in support of the Serbian cause in Kosovo, with some attracting up to 1,500 to 2,000 people. An organization called "Poles for Serbian Kosovo" was formed in order to provide and support for Serbs in Kosovo.
Peacekeeping.
Poland currently has 274 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the NATO led Kosovo Force. Originally there were 800 Polish troops in KFOR.
Cultural.
Music.
The "Kayah i Bregović"-album by Polish singer-songwriter Kayah and Serbian musician Goran Bregović became a bestseller after its release in 1999.
Gusle.
Polish poets of the 17th century mentioned the "gusle" in their works. In a poem published in 1612, Kasper Miaskowski wrote that "the Serbian gusle and gaidas will overwhelm Shrove Tuesday" ("Serbskie skrzypki i dudy ostatek zagluszą"). In the idyll named "Śpiewacy", published in 1663, Józef Bartłomiej Zimorowic used the phrase "to sing to the Serbian gusle" ("przy Serbskich gęślach śpiewać"). In some older Serbian books on literature it was stated that a Serbian "guslar" performed at the court of Władysław II Jagiełło in 1415, but this is not confirmed in Polish sources.

Iveagh (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)

Iveagh was a constituency of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.
Boundaries.
Iveagh was a county constituency comprising part of northern County Down, south west of Belfast. It was created when the House of Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats) Act (Northern Ireland) 1929 introduced first-past-the-post elections throughout Northern Ireland. Iveagh was created by the division of Down into eight new constituencies. The constituency survived unchanged until 1969, when its eastern part became part of the new Lagan Valley constituency. It returned one Member of Parliament until the Parliament of Northern Ireland was temporarily suspended in 1972, and then formally abolished in 1973.
The original seat was centred on the town of Dromore and also included parts of the rural districts of Banbridge, Hillsborough and Moira.
Politics.
The seat had a substantial unionist majority and was always won by Ulster Unionist Party candidates. It was often contested by independent Unionists, and once by a member of the Protestant Unionist Party, some of whom were able to take more than 40% of the votes cast.
Election results.
At the Northern Ireland general election, 1933, John Charles Wilson was elected unopposed.
At the Northern Ireland general election, 1945, Brian Maginess was elected unopposed.

Austria–Serbia relations

Austrian-Serbian relations are foreign relations between Austria and Serbia and their predecessor states. Austria has an embassy in Belgrade. Serbia has an embassy in Vienna and a general consulate in Salzburg.
History.
The history of relations between the two countries goes back the era when the Kingdom of Serbia (1718–1739) had been a province of the Habsburg Monarchy. But foreign relations, as such, date from the proclamation of the Austrian Empire in 1804 and the formation in 1817 of the Principality of Serbia, an autonomous state within the Ottoman Empire. The Habsburg recognized the independence of Serbia and established diplomatic relations in diplomatic relations in 1874, supported by the Treaty of Berlin (1878).
The history of relations between the two states was dominated by tension over Serbian ethnic irredentist claims on the regions, such as the Vojvodina, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Serbian sympathy for other South Slav minorities in the Habsburg Empire, combined with Austrian (and Hungarian) fears of pan-Slavism and Russian influence. Hungarian suppression of Serbian revolts during the 1848 Revolutions were not opposed by the Hapsburg rulers. Serbian claims were not recognized by Hungary was eventually placated with the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, further angering Serbian nationalists. One notable flare-up between the two countries was the 1906-1909 economic conflict known as the Pig War which occurred simultaneously with the diplomatic and military crisis over the Austrian annexation of Bosnia. Ultimately, the tensions between the two countries could not withstand the strain of Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Bosnian Serbs in 1914. Following the July Crisis, Austria invaded Serbia to punish it for supposedly supporting the assassins.
The resulting war eventually destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Empire, leaving a shrunken First Austrian Republic as a rump state. Serbia annexed much of the former Austrian holdings in the Balkans to become the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Austria was eventually annexed by Germany, ending its separate foreign relations.
Following the restoration of Austrian independence by the Austrian State Treaty in 1955, Austria became officially neutral in the emerging Cold War
Population.
There are between 200,000 and 300,000 people of Serbian descent living in Austria. The Serbs are either the largest or second-largest foreign population in Austria, although they are much less visible than the similarly-sized Turkish minority.

France–Serbia relations

French-Serbian relations are foreign relations between France and Serbia. Both countries established diplomatic relations on January 18, 1879, between French Third Republic and Kingdom of Serbia. France has an embassy in Belgrade. Serbia has an embassy in Paris, with diplomat Dr. Predrag Simić. Serbia also has 2 consulates (in Lyon and Strasbourg). Both countries are members of United Nations, Council of Europe, Partnership for Peace, and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). After a short period of severance caused by the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, France’s diplomatic relations with Serbia (then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) were restored on 16 November 2000. Since 2006, Serbia is an observer on the Francophonie.
There are between 70,000 and 100,000 people of Serbian descent living in France.
History.
Serbia and France have a history of sincere and noble relations. Those where seriously shaken with France participation in 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and Kosovo war, but have been improving since 2000.
The oldest documented possible contact between the two sides was the marriage of Stephen Uroš I of Serbia and Helen of Anjou. The first important contacts of French and Serbs came only in the 19th century when French travel writers first wrote about this Balkan country. In the 19th century, Karađorđe Petrović, leader of Serbian Revolution, sent a letter to Napoleon expressing his admiration, while in the French parliament, Victor Hugo made a speech asking France to assist Serbia and to protect the Serbian population from Ottoman crimes. Rapid development of bilateral relations followed, so that the people in Serbia saw a great new friend in "mighty France", that could protect them from the Ottomans and Habsburgs. Relations between Serbia and France continued to improve until the First World War, when the "common struggle" against a common enemy reached its peak. Before the war France won the sympathy of the Serbian population by building railways, opening French Schools, a Consulate and a French Bank. Several Serbian kings from this period studied at universities in Paris, as well as large part of the future diplomats. Serbs gained a sense of Francophile because all these activities moved them away from the Ottoman and Habsburg empires. The Serbian-French alliance until 1914 even threatened the traditional inclination towards Russia. Great humanitarian and military assistance was sent by France to Serbia during the First World War, including assistance in the evacuation of children, civilians and military at the end of the war, and the support of French newspaper headlines. Even today, these actions remain deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of a large number of Serbs.
Kosovo.
When Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 17 February 2008, France became one of the first countries to announce officially about recognition of sovereign Kosovo. Following Wikileaks report, France has made clear that Serbia can not enter the EU without recognizing Kosovo's independence. France participated in the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, which resulted in a UN administration of Kosovo and then to eventual independence. France currently has 1,368 troops serving in Kosovo as peacekeepers in the NATO led Kosovo Force. Originally there was 7,000 French troops in KFOR.
Cooperation.
With the signing of the Agreement on the Succession of Interstate Treaties on 26 March 2003, the procedure of consolidation of the treaty status between the two countries has been completed. Among the treaties, the most important ones are: the Agreement for the Protection of Investments (1974); the Agreement on the Avoidance of Double Taxation (1974); the Convention on Social Security (1950); the Agreement on Cultural Cooperation (1964); the Agreement on Road Transport (1964). In 2005, the volume of trade between the two countries was US$ 453,827 million. Serbian and French Presidents Boris Tadić and Nicolas Sarkozy signed in Paris at April 2011 a political declaration meant to support Serbia's EU integration.

Anillo Periférico

The Anillo Periférico (Spanish for "peripheral ring") is the name given to the outer beltway of Mexico City. 
The "Periferico" was originally planned by architect Carlos Contreras as early as 1925, together with other major roads such as the Viaducto Miguel Alemán. Some parts of the beltway were built to follow the bed of a river; the flow of the river was modified to flow through a pipe.
The beltway gained major media attention when the Mexico City mayor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, started a project to turn a southern section of the ring into a two-story highway. The second level was finished in 2006 in the Federal District and in the State of Mexico in 2009. From Cuautitlán in the north (State of Mexico) to Naucalpan at the Federal District border the second floor operates as the Viaducto Elevado Bicentenario ("Bicentennial Elevated Viaduct"). From the old bullring (Toreo) at the north of the Federal District to San Jerónimo in the southwest the second level is called the Autopista Urbana Norte ("Northern Urban Tollway"). At San Jerónimo the second level intersects directly with a toll road to Santa Fe, the Supervía Poniente. From San Jerónimo to the intersection with the Calzada de Tlalpan in the south of the city, the second level is called the Autopista Urbana Sur ("Southern Urban Tollway").

Enclosed helmet

The enclosed helmet, also termed a primitive great helm or early great helm, was a type of Western European helmet of the late 12th and early 13th century. It was the forerunner of the great helm.
Development and characteristics.
The enclosed helmet covered the entire head, with full protection for the face and somewhat deeper coverage for the sides and back of the head than that found on previous types of helmets. It was developed near the end of 12th century and was largely superseded by the true great helm by c. 1240. It is distinguishable from the great helm by a much greater depth to the face protection when compared to the depth of the helmet at the rear and sides.
It probably evolved from the nasal helmet, which had been produced in a flat-topped variant with a square profile by about 1180. The enclosed helmet was created by adding a face-protecting plate, pierced for sight and breathing, and by extending downwards the back and sides of a flat-topped helmet, to produce a cylindrical helm. From the evidence of extant contemporary illustrations the face protection was added first, probably as an extension of the pre-existing nasal. Some German illustrations dating to around 1180 show a bar at the end of the nasal covering the mouth, if such a bar had been extended and curved back to the brow of the helmet, a forerunner of a full face-plate would have been created.
One of the earliest illustrations of a fully developed example of this type of helmet, with the addition of a fan-shaped crest, is depicted on the second Great Seal of Richard I of England dating to 1198.
Use.
The enclosed helmet would have been worn over a mail coif, with additional padding circling the head to cushion the helmet and help absorb the force of any blow.
The helmet may have arisen from a need for greater facial protection in response to the penetrating power of couched lances used in the closely packed "conrois" formation. Or possibly as a response to an increased threat from archery. The enclosed helmet was only used by men of knightly rank. Many soldiers, including knights, disliked the restriction to sight and hearing imposed by the enclosed helmet, and therefore the more open round-topped and flat-topped nasal helmets, plus 'kettle hats', continued in use alongside it into the mid 13th century.

Australia–Serbia relations

Australian–Serbian relations are foreign relations between Australia and Serbia. The two countries maintained diplomatic relations established by Australia and SFR Yugoslavia in 1966. Australia has an embassy in Belgrade. Serbia has an embassy in Canberra and a general consulate in Sydney. The European office of the Australian Federal Police is located in Belgrade as of 2003.
In the 2006 Australian Census, 95,364 people identified themselves as having Serbian origin.
In 2006–07 period, Australian merchandise export to Serbia were about A$2.04 million, consisting primarily of toys, games and sporting goods. In the same period, Serbian exports were about A$3.19 million, consisting mainly of preserved food products. 
The Australian government took over all the bilateral treaties and agreements signed with the former Yugoslavia in its relations with Serbia, with reserve of cessation of certain contracts if they are considered to be surpassed. There are nine agreements in force, among which the most important are trade agreement, agreement of residence and employment of Serbian citizens in Australia and the Agreement on cultural cooperation. Cultural and education relations are based on the Agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation, which was concluded between the governments of two countries on 14 September 1976.
There have been no visits of heads of state or government between two countries in recent years. The delegation led by MPs Roger Price and Danna Vale and Senator Judith Troeth visited Serbia in October 2008 while the delegation led by Slavica Đukić Dejanović visited Australia in September 2009.

China–Serbia relations

Chinese-Serbian relations are foreign relations between China and Serbia. Relations have been maintained since SFR Yugoslavia's recognition of PR China on October 1, 1949, while diplomatic relations between the two countries were formally established by the exchange of diplomatic notes between the two Foreign Ministers on January 2, 1955. China has an embassy in Belgrade and also maintains an office in Priština based on consent of the Government of Serbia from November 2006. Serbia has an embassy in Beijing and a consulate-general in Shanghai. 
History.
1990 to present.
The PRC supported the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War and opposed the NATO airstrikes against targets in Serbia and Montenegro. The PRC believed that Milosevic was acting to prevent the secession of Kosovo by Albanian separatists from the FRY, and thus supported his actions as preserving the FRY's territorial integrity. The PRC opposed NATO intervention in Kosovo on the basis that it set a dangerous precedent that PRC officials believed could in the future afflict the PRC, should uprisings occur in Tibet or Xinjiang and then result in bombings. PRC opposition to the NATO actions intensified after the accidental bombing of the PR Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the war.
Kosovo.
PR China backs Serbia's position regarding Kosovo. The PR Chinese Foreign Minister has made a statement stressing that the PRC "expresses grave concern" over Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence. The Minister's remarks go on to add that "The resolution of the Kosovo issue bares on peace and stability of the Balkan region, the fundamental norms governing international relations as well as the authority and role of the UN Security Council. China always believes that a plan acceptable to both Serbia and Kosovo through negotiations is the best way to resolve this issue. The unilateral move taken by Kosovo will lead to a series of consequences. China is deeply worried about its severe and negative impact on peace and stability of the Balkan region and the goal of establishing a multi-ethnic society in Kosovo. China calls upon Serbia and Kosovo to continue negotiations for a proper resolution within the framework of the international law and work together to safeguard peace and stability of the Balkan region. The international community should create favorable conditions for that." Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Božidar Đelić told reporters after a meeting in Beijing with Politburo member Liu Yandong that China reiterated its support to help Serbia preserve her territorial integrity. "Just as Serbia supports the one China policy, China supports Serbia as its best and most stable friend in southeastern Europe." Ambassador of China to Serbia, Wei Jinghua, stated in June 2009 that "China respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia and understands the great concern of Serbia on the issue of Kosovo. We support the negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina that would bring a mutually acceptable solution, in accordance with international law, the UN Charter and UN resolutions."
Economic relations.
The People's Republic of China is the most important trading partner of the Republic of Serbia in the region of Asia. The volume of trade between the two countries in 2006 was US$788.1 million with Serbian exports taking US$ 6.25 million. While in period of January–October 2007, the trade totaled EUR 793.8 million. Serbia's exports to China were worth EUR 3.2 million.
Serbia exports to China are natural rubber, rubber products, machinery and equipment (special machine tools and road vehicles), cork, timber, etc. and Chinese exports to Serbia are machinery and equipment (office equipment, telecommunication equipment, electric machines), various manufactured goods, clothing, footwear, textiles, chemicals and staple items.
In 2006, Serbia officially confirmed its participation at Expo 2010 which will take place in Shanghai.
Culture and education.
Educational and cultural cooperation between the two countries is being maintained under the interstate Agreement on cultural cooperation that was concluded in Beijing on 7 June 1957.
The Confucius Institute in Belgrade has opened on August, 2006 by Tang Jiaxuan.
Strategic partnership.
Serbia and China signed an important strategic partnership agreement in August 2009. The agreement has ten points and covers wide array of subjects including the mutual respect of territorial integrity, plans for trade development as well as cultural, technological and scientific exchange.

<doc id="20082093" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20082093" title="Presidency of Barack Obama">
Presidency of Barack Obama

The Presidency of Barack Obama began at noon EST on January 20, 2009, when he became the 44th President of the United States. Obama was a United States Senator from Illinois at the time of his victory over Arizona Senator John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. Barack Obama is the first African-American president of the United States, as well as the first born in Hawaii.
His policy decisions have addressed a global financial crisis and have included changes in tax policies, legislation to reform the United States health care industry, foreign policy initiatives and the phasing out of detention of prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. He attended the G-20 London summit and later visited U.S. troops in Iraq. On the tour of various European countries following the G-20 summit, he announced in Prague that he intended to negotiate substantial reduction in the world's nuclear arsenals, en route to their eventual extinction. In October 2009, Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for "his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples."
He was elected to a second term on November 6, 2012. Having defeated Republican challenger Mitt Romney by winning 65.9 million popular votes and 332 electoral votes, he set forth his second term goals in his victory speech. He stressed the need to fight income inequality while also dealing with adaptation to global warming as well as reforming American education to promote technology and innovation, saying, "We believe in a generous America".
Transition period.
The presidential transition period began following Obama's election to the presidency on November 4, 2008. The Obama-Biden Transition Project was co-chaired by John Podesta, Valerie Jarrett, and Pete Rouse. During the transition period, Obama announced his nominations for his Cabinet and administration. Shortly after the election on November 4, Obama chose Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois as White House Chief of Staff.
Cabinet nominations included former Democratic primary opponents Hillary Rodham Clinton for Secretary of State and Bill Richardson for Secretary of Commerce (although the latter withdrew on January 4, 2009). Obama appointed Eric Holder as his Attorney General, the first African American appointed to that position. He also nominated Timothy F. Geithner to serve as Secretary of the Treasury. On December 1, Obama announced that he had asked Robert Gates to remain as Secretary of Defense, making Gates the first Defense head to carry over from a president of a different party. He nominated former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice to the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, which he restored to a Cabinet-level position.
During his transition, he maintained a website Change.gov, on which he wrote blogs to readers and uploaded video addresses by many of the members of his new cabinet. He announced strict rules for federal lobbyists, restricting them from financially contributing to his administration and forcing them to stop lobbying while working for him. The website also allowed individuals to share stories and visions with each other and the transition team in what was called the Citizen's Briefing Book, which was given to Obama shortly after his inauguration. Most of the information from Change.gov was transferred to the official White House website whitehouse.gov just after Obama's inauguration.
Inauguration.
Barack Obama was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. He officially assumed the presidency at 12:00 noon, EST, and completed the oath of office at 12:05 pm, EST. He delivered his inaugural address immediately following his oath. After his speech, he went to the President's Room in the House Wing of the Capitol and signed three documents: a commemorative proclamation, a list of Cabinet appointments, and a list of sub-Cabinet appointments, before attending a luncheon with congressional and administration leaders and invited guests. To commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of former President Abraham Lincoln, the same Bible that was used for Lincoln's inauguration was used in Obama's inauguration.
In administering the oath, Chief Justice John G. Roberts misplaced the word "faithfully" and erroneously replaced the phrase "President of the United States" with "President to the United States" before restating the phrase correctly; since Obama initially repeated the incorrect form, some scholars argued the President should take the oath again. On January 21, Roberts readministered the oath to Obama in a private ceremony in the White House Map Room, making him the seventh U.S. president to retake the oath; White House Counsel Greg Craig said Obama took the oath from Roberts a second time out of an "abundance of caution".
First 100 days.
Expectations.
Obama's 100th day in office was April 29, 2009. In his first post-election interview with "60 Minutes", Obama said that he had been studying Franklin Roosevelt's first 100 days, while adding, "The first hundred days is going to be important, but it's probably going to be the first thousand days that makes the difference."
Obama's first 100 days were highly anticipated ever since he became the presumptive nominee. Several news outlets created web pages dedicated to covering the subject. Commentators weighed in on challenges and priorities within domestic, foreign, economic, and environmental policy. CNN lists a number of economic issues that "Obama and his team will have to tackle in their first 100 days", foremost among which is passing and implementing a recovery package to deal with the financial crisis. Clive Stafford Smith, a British human rights lawyer, expressed hopes that the new president will close Guantanamo Bay detention camp in his first 100 days in office. After aides of the president announced his intention to give a major foreign policy speech in the capital of an Islamic country, there were speculations in Jakarta that he might return to his former home city within the first 100 days.
"The New York Times" devoted a five-part series, which was spread out over two weeks, to anticipatory analysis of Obama's first hundred days. Each day, the analysis of a political expert was followed by freely edited blog postings from readers. The writers compared Obama's prospects with the situations of Franklin D. Roosevelt (January 16, Jean Edward Smith), John F. Kennedy (January 19, Richard Reeves), Lyndon B. Johnson (January 23, Robert Dallek), Ronald Reagan (January 27, Lou Cannon), and Richard Nixon (February 4, Roger Morris).
Legislation and executive orders.
Within minutes of taking the Oath of Office on January 20, Obama's Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, issued an order suspending last-minute federal regulations pushed through by outgoing President George W. Bush, planning to review everything still pending. Due to the economic crisis, the President enacted a pay freeze for Senior White House Staff making more than $100,000 per year, as well as announcing stricter guidelines regarding lobbyists in an effort to raise the ethical standards of the White House. He asked for a waiver to his own new rules, however, for the appointments of William Lynn to the position of Deputy Defense Secretary, Jocelyn Frye to the position of director of policy and projects in the Office of the First Lady, and Cecilia Muñoz to the position of director of intergovernmental affairs in the executive office of the president, leading to some criticism of hypocrisy and violation of his pledge for governmental openness.
In his first week in office, Obama signed Executive Order 13492 suspending all the ongoing proceedings of Guantanamo military commission and ordering the detention facility to be shut down within the year. He also signed Executive Order 13491 – Ensuring Lawful Interrogations requiring the Army Field Manual to be used as a guide for terror interrogations, banning torture and other coercive techniques, such as waterboarding. Obama also issued an executive order entitled "Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel", setting stricter limitations on incoming executive branch employees and placing tighter restrictions on lobbying in the White House. Obama signed two Presidential Memoranda concerning energy independence, ordering the Department of Transportation to establish higher fuel efficiency standards before 2011 models are released and allowing states to raise their emissions standards above the national standard. He also ended the Mexico City Policy, which banned federal grants to international groups that provide abortion services or counseling.
In his first week he also established a policy of producing a weekly Saturday morning video address available on whitehouse.gov and YouTube, much like those released during his transition period. The first address had been viewed by 600,000 YouTube viewers by the next afternoon.
The first piece of legislation Obama signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 on January 29, which revised the statute of limitations for filing pay discrimination lawsuits. Lilly Ledbetter joined Obama and his wife, Michelle, as he signed the bill, fulfilling his campaign pledge to nullify "Ledbetter v. Goodyear". On February 3, he signed the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIP), expanding health care from 7 million children under the plan to 11 million.
After much debate, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) was passed by both the House and Senate on February 13, 2009. Originally intended to be a bipartisan bill, the passage of the bill was largely along party lines. No Republicans voted for it in the House, and three moderate Republicans voted for it in the Senate (Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania). The bill combined tax breaks with spending on infrastructure projects, extension of welfare benefits, and education. The final cost of the bill was $787 billion, and almost $1.2 trillion with debt service included. Obama signed the Act into law on February 17, 2009, in Denver, Colorado.
On March 9, 2009, Obama lifted restrictions on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research, and in doing so, called into question some of George W. Bush's signing statements. Obama stated that he too would employ signing statements if he deems upon review that a portion of a bill is unconstitutional, and he has issued several signing statements.
Early in his presidency, Obama signed a law raising the tobacco tax 62 cents on a pack of cigarettes. The tax is to be "used to finance a major expansion of health insurance for children", and "help some to quit and persuade young people not to start".
Approval ratings and opinion.
2009.
After his transition period, Obama entered office with an approval rating of 82%. At the end of his first week, 68% of respondents in a Gallup poll approved of how Obama was handling his job, the second highest approval rating for a President shortly after being elected since World War II.
Throughout early February polls showed scattered approval ratings: 62% (CBS News), 64% (USA Today/Gallup), 66% (Gallup), and 76% in an outlier poll (CNN/Opinion Research). Gallup reported the congressional address in late February boosted his approval from a term-low of 59% to 67%.
Throughout autumn 2009, Rasmussen estimated Obama's approval as fluctuating between 45% and 52% and his disapproval between 48% and 54%; as of November 11, Pew Research estimated Obama's approval between 51% and 55% and his disapproval between 33% and 37% since July.
Handling of the economy.
Rasmussen reported in mid-February 2009, that 55% of voters gave Obama good or excellent marks on his handling of the economy. In early March, a "The Wall Street Journal" survey of 49 economists gave Obama an average grade of 59 out of 100, with 42% of the respondents surveyed giving the administration's economic policies a grade below 60 percent. In comparison, only 30% of those same economists considered the response of governments around the world to the global recession to have been adequate. In April, a Gallup poll showed trust in Obama's economic policy with 71% saying they had "a fair amount" or "a great deal" of confidence in Obama's handling of the economy, higher than for Ben Bernanke, Tim Geithner, or leaders of Congress. Another Gallup poll in June showed 55% of Americans approved Obama's overall handling of the economy, but 48% and 51% disapproved of his handling of the federal budget deficit and controlling federal spending, respectively. A CBS News poll taken August 27–31 showed 53% of those polled approved of his handling of the economy. A Rasmussen poll taken on November 12 found 45% of Americans rating Obama's handling of the economy as poor and 39% rating him as doing a good or excellent job. They found 72% of Democrats rated his handling of the economy as good or excellent, while only 10% of Republicans and 27% of voters not affiliated with either party agreed.
2010.
On March 25, 2010, following his signing of landmark health care reform legislation into law, Obama's polling was revealed by Bloomberg to be 50%, with higher marks for relations with other countries (58%) and his running of the war in Afghanistan (54%). "Obama's approval rating is roughly equal to what Bill Clinton had at this point in his presidency, according to data maintained by Gallup (and) higher than the 45 percent Ronald Reagan recorded in April 1982" and more favorable than Democrats or Republicans in office at the time. They found Obama's approval rating was at 85% among Democrats, compared with 46% among independents and 11% among Republicans.
Fox News Channel released the results of two polls on April 8–9, 2010. The first showed a drop in Obama's approval rating to 43%, with 48% disapproving. In that poll, Democrats approved of Obama's performance 80–12%, while independents disapproved 49–38%. The other poll, which concentrated on the economy, showed disapproval of Obama's handling of the economy by a 53–42% margin, with 62% saying they were dissatisfied with the handling of the federal deficit. According to a Gallup Poll released April 10, 2010, President Obama had a 45% approval rating, with 48% disapproving. In a poll from Rasmussen Reports, released April 10, 2010, 47% approved of the President's performance, while 53% disapproved.
2011.
Obama's approval rating jumped to a high following the death of Osama Bin Laden on May 2, 2011. A GfK poll conducted May 5, 2011 found his approval rating to be 60%. During the debt ceiling debate in August 2011, Obama's approval rating dropped to the low-40s.
In October 2011, Obama instituted the We Can't Wait program, which involved using executive orders, administrative rulemaking, and recess appointments to institute policies without the support of Congress. The initiative was developed in response to what Obama claimed was Congress's unwillingness to pass economic legislation that he had proposed, and conflicts in Congress during the 2011 debt ceiling crisis.
2012.
President Obama began 2012 with approval/disapproval ratings roughly even in the high 40% range, and ended the year with roughly a 10% lead in approval vs. disapproval percentages.
2013.
President Obama began 2012 with roughly a 10% excess in approval vs. disapproval percentages, and ended the year with roughly a 10% deficit in approval vs. disapproval percentages.
Personnel.
Cabinet appointees.
Twenty-two members of the Obama administration are either in the United States Cabinet (15) or are in positions considered to be Cabinet-level (7). The members of the Cabinet are the heads of the fifteen major departments (State, Defense, Justice, etc.), and the seven cabinet-level positions are the Vice President, White House Chief of Staff, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador to the United Nations, and the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. Since Robert Gates was a member of the previous administration, his letter of resignation (a formality at the end of a President's term) was simply not accepted, and he did not need confirmation. On January 19, 2009, Senate Democratic leaders requested fifteen of the twenty positions to be ratified by unanimous consent, and seven gained unanimous confirmation by voice vote the next day: Ken Salazar, Steven Chu, Arne Duncan, Peter Orszag, Eric Shinseki, Tom Vilsack, and Janet Napolitano. On January 21, Obama presided over the swearing in of the seven unanimous nominees. Later that day, the Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton by a 94–2 vote. On January 22, several more confirmations were approved unanimously: Susan E. Rice, Ray LaHood, Lisa P. Jackson, and Shaun Donovan. On January 26, the Senate confirmed Geithner by a 60–34 margin.
At the conclusion of Obama's first week as President, Hilda Solis, Tom Daschle, Ron Kirk, and Eric Holder had yet to be confirmed, and there had been no second appointment for Secretary of Commerce. Holder was confirmed by a vote of 75–21 on February 2, and on February 3, Obama announced Senator Judd Gregg as his second nomination for Secretary of Commerce. Daschle withdrew later that day amid controversy over his failure to pay income taxes and potential conflicts of interest related to the speaking fees he accepted from health care interests. Solis was later confirmed by a vote of 80–17 on February 24, and Ron Kirk was confirmed on March 18 by a 92–5 vote in the Senate.
Gregg, who was the leading Republican negotiator and author of the TARP program in the Senate, after publication that he had a multi-million dollar investment in the Bank of America, on February 12, withdrew his nomination as Secretary of Commerce, citing "irresolvable conflicts" with President Obama and his staff over how to conduct the 2010 census and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Former Washington governor Gary Locke was nominated on February 26 as Obama's third choice for Commerce Secretary and confirmed on March 24 by voice vote.
On March 2, Obama introduced Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius as his second choice for Secretary of Health and Human Services. He also introduced Nancy-Ann DeParle as head of the new White House Office of Health Reform, which he suggested would work closely with the Department of Health and Human Services. At the end of March, Sebelius was the only remaining Cabinet member yet to be confirmed.
Six high-ranking cabinet nominees in the Obama administration had their confirmations delayed or rejected among reports that they did not pay all of their taxes, including Tom Daschle, Obama's original nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Though Geithner was confirmed, and Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, thought Daschle would have been confirmed, Daschle withdrew his nomination on February 3. Obama had nominated Nancy Killefer for the position of Chief Performance Officer, but Killefer also withdrew on February 3, citing unspecified problems with District of Columbia unemployment tax. A senior administration official said that Killefer's tax issues dealt with household help. Hilda Solis, Obama's nominee for Secretary of Labor, faced delayed confirmation hearings due to tax lien concerns pertaining to her husband's auto repair business, but she was later confirmed on February 24. While pundits puzzled over U.S. Trade Representative-designate Ron Kirk's failure to be confirmed by March 2009, it was reported on March 2 that Kirk owed over $10,000 in back taxes. Kirk agreed to pay them in exchange for Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus's aid in speeding up the confirmation process; he was later confirmed on March 18. On March 31, Kathleen Sebelius, Obama's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, revealed in a letter to the Senate Finance Committee that her Certified Public Accountant found errors in her tax returns for years 2005–2007. She, along with her husband, paid more than $7,000 in back taxes, along with $878 in interest.
Notable non-Cabinet positions.
Appointees serve at the pleasure of the President and were nominated by Barack Obama except as noted.
1Appointed by George W. Bush in 2006 to a five-year term
2Appointed by George W. Bush in 2001 to a ten-year term
Judicial nominees.
United States Supreme Court.
Obama appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:
Other courts.
Outside of the Supreme Court, by October 2009, Obama had nominated fewer than two dozen judges to fill judicial vacancies, of which there were close to 100. This has prompted some Democrats to criticize the pace of Obama's judicial appointments as too slow. In December 2009, Senator Patrick Leahy criticized Republicans for stalling those judicial nominations that had been made, noting that the Senate confirmed more district and circuit court nominees during the first year of the George W. Bush administration than it had approved by that point during the Barack Obama presidency.
Policies.
Economy.
Upon entering office, Obama planned to center his attention on handling the global financial crisis. Even before his inauguration he lobbied Congress to pass an economic stimulus bill, which became the top priority during his first month in office. As President, Obama made a high profile trip to Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C. to dialog with Congressional Republicans and advocate for the bill. On February 17, 2009, Obama signed into law a $787 billion plan that included spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals. The tax provisions of the law reduced taxes for 98 percent of taxpayers, bringing tax rates to their lowest levels in 60 years.
As part of the 2010 budget proposal, the Obama administration has proposed additional measures to attempt to stabilize the economy, including a $2–3 trillion measure aimed at stabilizing the financial system and freeing up credit. The program includes up to $1 trillion to buy toxic bank assets, an additional $1 trillion to expand a federal consumer loan program, and the $350 billion left in the Troubled Assets Relief Program. The plan also includes $50 billion intended to slow the wave of mortgage foreclosures. The 2011 budget includes a three-year freeze on discretionary spending, proposes several program cancellations, and raises taxes on high income earners to bring down deficits during the economic recovery.
There was a sustained increase of the U.S. unemployment rate during the early part of the administration, as multi-year economic stimulus efforts continued. The unemployment rate reached a peak in October 2009 at 10.1%, then fell throughout 2010 through 2012, recovering more slowly than in past recessions.
GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a 1.6% pace, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter. Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year. Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.
During November–December 2010, Obama and a lame duck session of the 111th Congress focused on a dispute about the temporary Bush tax cuts, which were due to expire at the end of the year. Obama wanted to extend the tax cuts for taxpayers making less than $250,000 a year. Congressional Republicans agreed but also wanted to extend the tax cuts for those making over that amount, and refused to support any bill that did not do so. All the Republicans in the Senate also joined in saying that, until the tax dispute was resolved, they would filibuster to prevent consideration of any other legislation, except for bills to fund the U.S. government. On December 7, Obama strongly defended a compromise agreement he had reached with the Republican congressional leadership that included a two-year extension of all the tax cuts, a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance, a one-year reduction in the FICA payroll tax, and other measures. On December 10, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) led a filibuster against the compromise tax proposal, which lasted over eight hours. Obama persuaded many wary Democrats to support the bill, but not all; of the 148 votes against the bill in the House, 112 were cast by Democrats and only 36 by Republicans. The $858 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, which "The Washington Post" called "the most significant tax bill in nearly a decade", passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress and was signed into law by Obama on December 17, 2010.
Ethics.
Lobbying reform.
Early in his presidential campaign, Obama stated that "they won't find a job in my White House", but softened his stance later in the campaign. On January 21, 2009, Obama issued an executive order for all future appointees to his administration, which stated, no appointee who was a registered lobbyist within the two years before his appointment could participate on matters in which he lobbied for a period of two years after the date of appointment. Three formal waivers were initially issued in early 2009, out of 800 executive appointments: to William J. Lynn III, a lobbyist for Raytheon, to hold the position of Deputy Secretary of Defense; to Jocelyn Frye, former general counsel at the National Partnership for Women and Families, to serve as Director of Policy and Projects in the Office of the First Lady; and to Cecilia Muñoz, former senior vice president for the National Council of La Raza, to serve as Director of Intergovernmental Affairs in the Executive Office of the President. As of March 21, 2009, at least thirty officials appointed by Obama had been lobbyists in the past five years. Ten additional waivers were announced in September 2009.
Not all recent former lobbyists require waivers; those without waivers write letters of recusal stating issues from which they must refrain because of their previous jobs. "USA Today" reported that 21 members of the Obama administration have at some time been registered as federal lobbyists, although most have not within the previous two years. Lobbyists in the administration include William Corr, an anti-tobacco lobbyist, as Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services and Tom Vilsack, who lobbied in 2007, for a national teachers union, as Secretary of Agriculture. Also, the Secretary of Labor nominee, Hilda Solis, formerly served as a board member of American Rights at Work, which lobbied Congress on two bills Solis co-sponsored, and Mark Patterson, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's chief of staff, is a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs.
The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington have criticized the administration, claiming that Obama is retreating from his own ethics rules barring lobbyists from working on the issues about which they lobbied during the previous two years by issuing waivers. According to Melanie Sloan, the group's executive director, "It makes it appear that they are saying one thing and doing another."
Transparency.
The Obama administration has said that all executive orders, non-emergency legislation, and proclamations will be posted to the official White House website, whitehouse.gov, allowing the public to review and comment for five days before the President signs the legislation. The pledge was twice broken during Obama's first month in office when he signed SCHIP legislation and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act with less than the full five days of "sunlight before signing". The administration has said that they are still "working through implementation procedures and some initial issues with the congressional calendar".
During his first week in office, Obama announced plans to post a video address each week on the site, and on YouTube, informing the public of government actions each week. During his speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Obama stated, "I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less – because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy."
On January 21, 2009, by executive order, Obama revoked Executive Order 13233, which had limited access to the records of former United States presidents. Obama issued instructions to all agencies and departments in his administration to "adopt a presumption in favor" of Freedom of Information Act requests. In April 2009, the United States Department of Justice released four legal memos from the Bush administration to comply voluntarily with a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The memos were written by John Yoo and signed by Jay Bybee and Steven Bradbury, then Principal Assistant Attorneys General to the Department of Justice, and addressed to John A. Rizzo, general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency. The memos describe in detail controversial interrogation methods the CIA used on prisoners suspected of terrorism. Obama became personally involved in the decision to release the memos, which was opposed by former CIA directors Michael Hayden, Porter Goss, George Tenet and John Deutch. Former Vice President Dick Cheney criticized Obama for not releasing more memos; Cheney claimed that unreleased memos detail successes of CIA interrogations. A 2012 analysis by Bloomberg News indicates that The Obama Administration has failed to follow the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. White House spokesman Jay Carney defended the President's record, stating that the Administration has shown "unprecedented transparency."
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act requires all recipients of the funds provided by the act to publish a plan for using the funds, along with purpose, cost, rationale, net job creation, and contact information about the plan to a website Recovery.gov so that the public can review and comment. Inspectors General from each department or executive agency will then review, as appropriate, any concerns raised by the public. Any findings of an Inspector General must be relayed immediately to the head of each department and published on Recovery.gov.
On June 16, 2009, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration in order to get information about the visits of coal company executives. Anne Weismann, the chief counsel for CREW, stated
"The Obama administration has now taken exactly the same position as the Bush administration... I don't see how you can keep people from knowing who visits the White House and adhere to a policy of openness and transparency." On June 16, MSNBC reported that its more comprehensive request for visitor logs since Obama's January 20 inauguration had been denied. The administration announced that White House visitor logs will be made available to the public on an ongoing basis, with certain limitations, for visits occurring after September 15, 2009. Beginning on January 29, 2010, the White House did begin to release the names of its visitor records. Since that time, names of visitors (which includes not only tourists, but also names of union leaders, Wall Street executives, lobbyists, party chairs, philanthropists and celebrities), have been released. The names are released in huge batches up to 75,000 names at a time. Names are released 90–120 days after having visited the White House. The complete list of names is available online by accessing the official White House website.
Obama stated during the 2008 Presidential campaign that he would have negotiations for health care reform televised on C-SPAN, citing transparency as being the leverage needed to ensure that people stay involved in the process taking place in Washington. This did not fully happen and Politifact gives President Obama a "Promise Broken" rating on this issue. After White House press secretary Robert Gibbs initially avoided addressing the issue, President Obama himself acknowledged that he met with Democratic leaders behind closed doors to discuss how best to garner enough votes in order to merge the two (House and Senate) passed versions of the health care bill. Doing this violated the letter of the pledge, although Obama maintains that negotiations in several congressional committees were open, televised hearings. Obama also cited an independent ethics watchdog group describe his administration as the most transparent in recent history.
The Obama administration has been characterized as much more aggressive than the Bush and other previous administrations in their response to whistleblowing and leaks to the press, prompting critics to describe the Obama Administration's crackdown as a "war on whistleblowers." Eight people have been charged under the previously rarely used leak-related provisions of the Espionage Act of 1917. They include Thomas Andrews Drake, a former National Security Agency (NSA) employee who was critical of the Trailblazer Project, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, a State Department contractor who allegedly had a conversation about North Korea with James Rosen of Fox News Channel, and Jeffrey Sterling, who allegedly was a source for James Risen's book . Risen has also been subpoenaed to reveal his sources, another rare action by the government. Also, Shamai Leibowitz, a contract linguist for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was convicted of leaking information from embassy wiretaps, John Kiriakou, a former CIA analyst pleaded guilty to passing classified information, Bradley Manning, an intelligence analyst for the US Army pleaded guilty to passing classified information to the Wikileaks organization, and James Hitselberger, a former contract linguist for the US Navy in Bahrain is charged with possessing classified documents. Most notably, Edward Snowden, a technical contractor for the NSA and former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is currently at large and has been charged with theft and the unauthorized disclosure of classified information to columnist Glenn Greenwald.
Organizing for Action donations for meetings.
In February 2013, the "New York Times" reported that Organizing for Action (OFA), formerly the Obama for America 2012 presidential campaign organization, had offered quarterly meetings with Obama at the White House in return for donations of $500,000 or more. White House press spokesman Jay Carney denied that access to the President was being "sold," stating that OFA was an independent organization, and referred specific questions to OFA staff. Two weeks later, Obama reelection campaign manager Jim Messina said that the group would no longer accept corporate donations and would disclose donation amounts. OFA executive director Jon Carson and Messina both said OFA is a non-partisan, grassroots issue advocacy group. However, Organizing for Action had announced donations from wealthy liberal insiders such as George Soros and corporations including Lockheed Martin, Citi, and Duke Energy. On March 8, Messina told CBS News that donors could meet with the president, but not at the White House. The Sunlight Foundation complained that a list of donors and the amount they had contributed was not available when OFA held its initial meeting. Prominent Republican leaders including Mitch McConnell and Bruce Eberle criticized the offer as a pay for access scandal.
Foreign policy.
In his inaugural address, Obama suggested that he plans to begin the process of withdrawing from Iraq and continuing to focus on the war in Afghanistan. He also mentioned lessening the nuclear threat through "working tirelessly with old friends and former foes". He spoke about America's determination to combat terrorism, proclaiming America's spirit is "stronger and cannot be broken — you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you." To the Muslim world, Obama extended an invite to "a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect". He also said the USA would "extend a hand" to those "who cling to power through corruption and deceit" if they "are willing to unclench" their fists. Shortly after his inauguration President Obama first called President Abbas of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Calls were also made to President Mubarak of Egypt, Prime Minister Olmert of Israel and King Abdullah of Jordan. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton named George Mitchell as Special Envoy for Middle East peace and Richard Holbrooke as special representative to Pakistan and Afghanistan on January 23, 2009. At the same time, Obama called on Israel to open the borders of Gaza, detailing early plans on his administration's peace plans for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.
On February 18, 2009, Obama announced that the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be bolstered by 17,000 new troops by summer. The announcement followed the recommendation of several experts including Defense Secretary Robert Gates that additional troops be deployed to the war-torn nation.
Obama declared his plan for ending the Iraq War on February 27, 2009, in a speech at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, before an audience of Marines stationed there. According to the president, combat troops will be withdrawn from Iraq by August 2010, leaving a contingent of up to 50,000 servicemen and servicewomen to continue training, advisory, and counterterrorism operations until as late as the end of 2011.
Other characteristics of the Obama administration on foreign policy include a tough stance on tax havens, continuing military operation in Pakistan, and avowed focus on diplomacy to prevent nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea.
On April 1, 2009, Obama and China's President, Hu Jintao, announced the establishment of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue and agreed to work together to build a positive, cooperative, and comprehensive U.S.-China relationship for the 21st century.
In that same month, Obama requested that Congress approve $83.4 billion of supplemental military funding, mostly for the war in Iraq and to increase troop levels in Afghanistan. The request also includes $2.2 billion to increase the size of the US military, $350 million to upgrade security along the US-Mexico border, and $400 million in counterinsurgency aid for Pakistan.
In May 2009, it was reported that Obama plans to expand the military by 20,000 employees.
On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt. The wide ranging speech called for a "new beginning" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States. The speech received both praise and criticism from leaders in the region. In March 2010, Secretary of State Clinton criticized the Israeli government for approving expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem.
On April 8, 2010, Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the latest Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), a "major" nuclear arms control agreement that reduces the nuclear weapons stockpiles of both countries.
In March 2011, international reaction to Muammar Gaddafi's military crackdown on rebel forces and civilians in Libya culminated in a United Nations resolution to enforce a no fly zone in Libya. Obama authorized U.S. forces to participate in international air attacks on Libyan air defenses using Tomahawk cruise missiles to establish the protective zone.
In June 2013 the existence of PRISM, a clandestine mass electronic surveillance data mining program operated by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) since 2007, was leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who warned that the extent of mass data collection was far greater than the public knew and included what he characterized as "dangerous" and "criminal" activities. The revelations were published by the British newspaper "The Guardian" and the "Washington Post". In the face of international outrage, U.S. government officials have disputed some aspects of the reporting by those newspapers, and have defended the PRISM surveillance program by asserting it cannot be used on domestic targets without a warrant, that it has helped to prevent acts of terrorism, and that it receives independent oversight from the federal government's executive, judicial and legislative branches. On June 19, 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama, during a visit to Germany, stated that the NSA's data gathering practices constitute "a circumscribed, narrow system directed at us being able to protect our people."
The Obama administration has received heavy criticism from citizen activists and members of the Democratic Party for the lack of transparency in the negotiations surrounding the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and the presence of some 600 corporate representatives to assist in the drafting process. Critics claim that it would expand political powers for corporations, weaken financial regulations and increase the cost of prescription drugs. In November 2013, WikiLeaks released the draft text of a chapter pertaining to intellectual property rights, which Julian Assange said "would trample over individual rights and free expression" if ever implemented.
Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
On his first day in office, Obama requested a 120-day suspension of all trials for alleged terrorists held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, so the new administration could "review the military commissions process, generally, and the cases pending before military commissions , specifically". Another order established a task force to lead a review of detention policies, procedures and individual cases. Obama addressed the State Department that "the United States will not torture" and drafted an executive order to close Guantanamo within a year. On January 22, 2009, Obama signed an executive order ensuring safe, lawful, and humane treatment of individuals detained in armed conflicts. This order restricts interrogators to methods listed and authorized by an Army Field Manual. A detainee released since Obama took office claimed in an interview with Agence France-Presse that conditions at Guantanamo had worsened, stating guards wanted to "take their last revenge" before the facility is closed. On March 13, 2009, the administration announced that it would no longer refer to prisoners at Guantanamo Bay as enemy combatants, but it also asserted that the president has the authority to detain terrorism suspects there without criminal charges.
The case review of detainee files by administration officials and prosecutors was made more difficult than expected as "the Bush administration had not established a consolidated repository of the evidence and intelligence on each prisoner". By September 2009, prosecutors recommended to the Justice Department which detainees are eligible for trial, and the Justice Department and the Pentagon worked together to determine which of several now-scheduled trials will go forward in military tribunals and which in civilian courts. While 216 international terrorists are already held in maximum security prisons in the U.S., Congress was denying the administration funds to shut down the camp and adapt existing facilities elsewhere, arguing that the decision was "too dangerous to rush". In November, Obama stated that the U.S. would miss the January 2010 date for closing the Guantanamo Bay prison as he had ordered, acknowledging that he "knew this was going to be hard". Obama did not set a specific new deadline for closing the camp, citing that the delay was due to politics and lack of congressional cooperation. The state of Illinois has offered to sell to the federal government the Thomson Correctional Center, a new but largely unused prison, for the purpose of housing detainees. Federal officials testified at a December 23 hearing that if the state commission approves the sale for that purpose, it could take more than six months to ready the facility.
In November 2009, the Obama Administration announced plans to give accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed a civilian trial in New York City. Critics asserted that the trial risked handing over national security information to Al Qaeda via the discovery process. In April 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder canceled the civilian trial. He blasted Congress, which had refused to fund the trial, and stated that he still believed a civilian trial was the best option.
Killing of Osama bin Laden.
Starting with information received in July 2010, intelligence developed by the CIA over the next several months determined what they believed to be the location of Osama bin Laden in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles from Islamabad. CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to Obama in March 2011. Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a "surgical raid" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs. The operation took place on May 1, 2011, resulting in the death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers and computer drives and disks from the compound. Bin Laden's body was identified through DNA testing, and buried at sea several hours later. Within minutes of Obama's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square. Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from predecessors George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and from many countries around the world.
Developments in the Muslim world.
In June 2009, protests broke out in Iran after Presidential elections that many Iranians believe were marred by fraud. Obama called on the Iranian Government to stop "violent and unjust" action against the protesters, but resisted calls to do more than that. He was criticized for not being more forceful. He responded that "the last thing I want to do is to have the United States be a foil for—those forces inside Iran who would love nothing better than to make this an argument about the United States." Protests broke out again in Iran in February 2011 and were again met with force.
After a sudden revolution in Tunisia, Arab discontent began to spread. Demonstrations broke out Egypt in January and February 2011. Press reports indicated that Obama followed a strategy of pressing for dramatic change and leaving little doubt that he felt Mubarak's resignation would be desirable, without actually saying so. After three weeks of unrest, Mubarak resigned. Anti-government protests broke out in Benghazi, Libya, in February 2011, and the Gadaffi government responded with military force. The Obama Administration initially resisted calls to take strong action but relented after the Arab League requested Western intervention in Libya. The U.S. provided air support, especially at the beginning of the operation, and helped in areas in which it has unique capabilities, such as electronic warfare and aerial surveillance. The Obama administration demanded and got participation from several Arab and European nations and Obama stated that the U.S. would not send any ground troops. With coalition support, the rebels took Tripoli the following August. By the second half of March 2011, anti-government protests were being held in Syria and police killed protesters in several cities. In March 2012, Obama argued that unilateral military action would be a mistake. As of June 2012, several experts characterized the situation as a civil war.
Overseas Contingency Operation.
Obama discontinued use of the term "War on Terror" and instead uses the term "Overseas Contingency Operation". However, Obama has stated that the U.S. is at war with Al-Qaeda, saying "Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred."
Drone Attacks in Pakistan.
The U.S. drone (unmanned aerial vehicles) attacks on targets in Pakistan, that were begun by President George W. Bush, have increased substantially under President Barack Obama, resulting in between 306 and 849 casualties annually (2009–2012). In 2009, an expansion of the drone attacks was authorized by President Barack Obama and targeted rescuers, funerals, and one U.S. citizen. UN reports have described the U.S. drone wars as extrajudicial killing and summary justice, and have called on the Obama administration to justify its use of targeted assassinations rather than attempting to capture al Qaeda or Taliban suspects. Surveys have shown that the strikes are deeply unpopular in Pakistan.
In May 2013, the Obama administration admitted that four U.S. citizens had been killed by drones since 2009, and that one of those men was intentionally targeted. In April 2010, the Obama administration had authorized the "targeted killing" of the radical Muslim cleric and American citizen Anwar al-Aulaqi, using a drone. al-Aulaqi was believed to have shifted from encouraging attacks on the United States to directly participating in them. This was the first known instance of a sitting U.S. president ordering the extrajudicial killing of a U.S. citizen. The Justice Department's legal memorandum authorizing the strike, which asserted that Fifth Amendment due process rights "could be satisfied by internal deliberations in the executive branch", has not been released to the public.
Cyber-warfare.
According to David Sanger of "The New York Times", Obama continued and expanded the cyber-warfare program of George W. Bush's administration, leading to the creation of the Stuxnet virus that infected Iranian nuclear centrifuges.
Gun control.
During the presidential campaign, Obama announced that he favors measures that respect Second Amendment rights, while at the same time keeping guns away from children and criminals. On February 25, 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Obama administration would seek a new assault weapons ban across the United States, saying that it would have a positive impact on the drug-related violence in Mexico. After the statement drew criticism from the NRA and some House Democrats, the Administration reportedly ordered the Justice Department to end public discussion of the issue. Obama has signed into law two bills containing amendments reducing restrictions on gun owners, one which permits guns to be transported in checked baggage on Amtrak trains and another which allows carrying loaded firearms in national parks located in states allowing concealed carry. In his public address regarding the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama said, "As a country we have been through this too many times... these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics." On January 16, 2013, President Obama outlined a series of sweeping gun control proposals, urging Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on "military-style" assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.
Science and technology.
Cybersecurity.
Obama initiated a 60-day review of cybersecurity by Melissa Hathaway, a consultant for Booz Allen Hamilton, appointed Acting Senior Director for Cyberspace.
"The New York Times" reported in 2009, that the NSA is intercepting communications of American citizens including a Congressman, although the Justice Department believed that the NSA had corrected its errors. United States Attorney General Eric Holder resumed the wiretapping according to his understanding of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008 that Congress passed in July 2008, but without explaining what had occurred.
Environment.
On January 27, 2009, Obama issued two presidential memoranda concerning energy policy. One directed the Department of Transportation to raise fuel efficiency standards incrementally to by 2020, and the other directed the Environmental Protection Agency to allow individual states to set stricter tailpipe emissions regulations than the federal standard.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided $54 billion in funds to encourage domestic renewable energy production, make federal buildings more energy-efficient, improve the electricity grid, repair public housing, and weatherize modest-income homes.
On February 10, 2009, Obama overturned a Bush administration policy that had opened up a five-year period of offshore drilling for oil and gas near both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has been quoted as saying, "To establish an orderly process that allows us to make wise decisions based on sound information, we need to set aside" the plan "and create our own timeline".
On May 19, 2009, Obama announced a plan to increase the Corporate Average Fuel Economy national standards for gasoline mileage, by creating a single new national standard that will create a car and light truck fleet in the United States that is almost 40 percent cleaner and more fuel-efficient by 2016, than it is today, with an average of 35.5 miles per gallon. Environmental advocates and industry officials welcomed the new program, but for different reasons. Environmentalists called it a long-overdue tightening of emissions and fuel economy standards after decades of government delay and industry opposition. Auto industry officials said it would provide the single national efficiency standard they have long desired, a reasonable timetable to meet it and the certainty they need to proceed with product development plans.
On March 30, 2010, Obama partially reinstated Bush administration proposals to open certain offshore areas along the Atlantic coastline, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the north coast of Alaska to oil and natural gas drilling. The proposals had earlier been set aside by President Obama after they were challenged in court on environmental grounds.
On May 27, 2010, Obama extended a moratorium on offshore drilling permits after the April 20, 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill which is considered to be the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Although BP took responsibility for the disaster and its ongoing after effects, Obama began a federal investigation along with forming a bipartisan commission to review the incident and methods to avoid it in the future. Obama visited the Gulf Coast on May 2 and 28 and expressed his frustration on the June 8 "NBC Today Show", by saying "I don't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar. We talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers, so I know whose ass to kick." Obama's response to the disaster drew confusion and criticism within segments of the media and public.
NASA.
Obama set up the Augustine panel to review the Constellation program in 2009, and announced in February 2010, that he was cutting the program from the 2011 United States federal budget, describing it as "over budget, behind schedule, and lacking in innovation." After the decision drew criticism in the United States, a new "Flexible path to Mars" plan was unveiled at a space conference in April 2010. It included new technology programs, increased R&D spending, a focus on the International Space Station and contracting out flying crew to space to commercial providers. The new plan also increased NASA's 2011 budget to $19 billion from $18.3 billion in 2010.
In July 2009, Obama appointed Charles Bolden, a former astronaut, to be administrator of NASA.
Stem cell research.
On March 9, 2009, Obama repealed a Bush-era policy that prevented federal tax dollars from being used to fund research on new lines of embryonic stem cells. Such research has been a matter of debate between those who emphasize the therapeutic potential of such research and those who suggest that elements of this research breach ethical limitations. Obama stated that "In recent years, when it comes to stem cell research, rather than furthering discovery, our government has forced what I believe is a false choice between sound science and moral values...In this case, I believe the two are not inconsistent. As a person of faith, I believe we are called to care for each other and work to ease human suffering. I believe we have been given the capacity and will to pursue this research — and the humanity and conscience to do so responsibly."
Social policy.
On January 23, 2009, Obama rescinded the Mexico City Policy, a measure from the Reagan and Bush eras that required any non-governmental organization receiving U.S. Government funding to refrain from performing or promoting abortion services in other countries.
On June 17, 2009, Obama authorized the extension of some benefits (but not health insurance or pension benefits) to same-sex partners of federal employees. Obama has chosen to leave larger changes, such as the repeal of Don't ask, don't tell and the Defense of Marriage Act, to Congress.
On October 19, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a directive to federal prosecutors in states with medical marijuana laws not to investigate or prosecute cases of marijuana use or production done in compliance with those laws.</ref>
On December 16, 2009, President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, which repealed a 21-year-old ban on federal funding of needle exchange programs.
On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, a bill that provides for repeal of the Don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993, that has prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces. Repealing "Don't ask, don't tell" had been a key campaign promise that Obama had made during the 2008 presidential campaign.
Health care reform.
Once the stimulus bill was enacted, health care reform became Obama's top domestic priority. On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,000-page plan for overhauling the US health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of the year.
The U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the ten-year cost to the federal government of the major insurance-related provisions of the bill at approximately $1.0 trillion. In mid-July 2009, Douglas Elmendorf, director of the CBO, testified that the proposals under consideration would significantly increase federal spending and did not include the "fundamental changes" needed to control the rapid growth in health care spending. However after reviewing the final version of the bill introduced after 14 months of debate the CBO estimated that it would reduce federal budget deficits by $143 billion over 10 years and by more than a trillion in the next decade.
After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over his administration's proposals. In March 2010, Obama gave several speeches across the country to argue for the passage of health care reform. On March 21, 2010, after Obama announced an executive order reinforcing the current law against spending federal funds for elective abortion services, the House, by a vote of 219 to 212, passed the version of the bill previously passed on December 24, 2009, by a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate. The bill, which includes over 200 Republican amendments, was passed without a single Republican vote. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the bill into law. Immediately following the bill's passage, the House voted in favor of a reconciliation measure to make significant changes and corrections to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was passed by both houses with two minor alterations on March 25, 2010, and signed into law on March 30, 2010.
Education reform.
On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which ended the role of private banks in lending out federally insured student loans. By directly lending to students, the government is projected to save taxpayers $68 billion over the next several years. Federally insured student loans will instead be distributed by the Department of Education. The law also increased the amount of Pell Grant awards given each year, doubling its current funding. Starting in 2014, the law permits borrowers to cap the amount they spend on student loans each year to ten percent of their discretionary income and have their balance forgiven if they have faithfully paid the balance of their loan over 20 years. Additionally, the law seeks to make it easier for parents to qualify for Grad PLUS loans, and spends billions on poor and minority schools and $2 billion for community colleges.
Gates arrest controversy.
On July 16, 2009, prominent African-American Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., was arrested at his Cambridge, Massachusetts home by a local police officer, Cambridge Police Sgt. James Crowley, for disorderly conduct. Gates, who was locked out of his house, had attempted to break into his own property, thus causing the initial alarm from a neighbor who called 9-1-1. The incident sparked national controversy over whether Gates's civil rights had been violated by Crowley. On July 21, the Cambridge Police Department dropped charges against Gates. On July 22, President Barack Obama, commented on the incident over national and international television, criticized the arrest, and stated the police acted "stupidly" in handling the incident. National law enforcement organizations and members objected to Obama's comments and criticized his handling of the issue. In the aftermath, Obama stated that he regretted his comments exacerbating the situation, and hoped that the situation could become a "teachable moment". To reduce tensions, on July 24, Obama invited both parties to the White House to discuss the issue over beers, and on July 30, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden joined Crowley and Gates in a private, cordial meeting in a courtyard near the White House Rose Garden; this became known colloquially as the "Beer Summit".
Wall Street reform.
On July 21, 2010, Obama signed the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, considered to be the largest financial system overhaul since the New Deal. The stated goals of the law were to provide financial regulatory reform, to protect consumers and investors, to end too-big-to-fail, to regulate the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets, and to prevent another financial crisis, among others. Obama said "There will be no more taxpayer-funded bailouts. Period," at the signing ceremony in the Ronald Reagan Building, and added that "These reforms represent the strongest consumer financial protections in history." Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) and Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass.), the two committee chairmen who sponsored the bill, attended the ceremony.
2010 midterm elections.
Attacking Obama relentlessly, emphasizing the stalled economy, and fueled by the anger of the Tea Party Movement, Republicans scored a landslide in the 2010 midterm elections, winning control of the House and gaining seats in the Senate.
Obama blamed himself, in part, for the many Democrats who went down to defeat knowing that they had risked their careers to support his agenda of economic stimulus legislation and a landmark health care bill. Obama called the elections "humbling" and a "shellacking", arguing that the defeat came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.
2012 re-election campaign.
On April 4, 2011, Obama announced that he would seek re-election in the 2012 presidential election. The campaign would be based in Chicago and run by many former members of the White House staff and members of the successful 2008 campaign.
The campaign succeeded: on November 6, 2012 Obama won a second term.

A Tale of Love and Darkness

A Tale of Love and Darkness () is an autobiographical novel by Israeli author Amos Oz, first published in Hebrew in 2002.
The book has been translated into 28 languages and over a million copies have been sold worldwide. In 2011, a bootleg Kurdish translation was found in a bookstore in northern Iraq. Oz was reportedly delighted.
Oz chronicles his childhood in Jerusalem at the end of the British Mandate for Palestine and the early years of the State of Israel, and his teenage years on Kibbutz Hulda. As a child, he crossed paths with prominent figures in Israeli society, among them Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Shaul Tchernichovsky and David Ben-Gurion. One of his teachers was the Israeli poet Zelda. Joseph Klausner was his great-uncle. Told in a non-linear fashion, Oz's story is interwoven with tales of his family's Eastern European roots. The family's name was Klausner. By changing the name to a Hebrew one, Oz rebelled against that European background while affirming loyalty to the land of his birth. In the book, Oz's father recalls how the walls in Europe were covered in graffiti saying “Jews, go to Palestine," but when he reached Palestine, the walls were scrawled with the words “Jews, get out of Palestine.”
A production company owned by Natalie Portman has acquired the film rights to the book.
Elias Khoury, a Palestinian-Israeli lawyer whose father Daoud was a victim in a suicide bombing of Zion Square and whose son George was shot to death by Palestinian militants who mistook him for a Jew (see George Khoury), paid to have the book translated into Arabic and distributed in Beirut and other Arab cities in order to promote better understanding of the Jewish people's narrative of national rebirth.

The Lime Works

The Lime Works is a novel by Thomas Bernhard, first published in German in 1970. It’s a complex surrealist work, where the creativity and resourcefulness of a destructive personality is marshalled against itself in a nightmarish narration.
Synopsis.
The story opens with a description of a woman’s brains scattered across the floor of an abandoned lime works, and a half-frozen man crouching on the ground nearby, covered in manure.
From this first grotesque scene, Bernhard begins his story, a compelling tale of two people insidiously bound to each other, told through a hypnotic wave of voices – the people of the small Austrian town nearby (Sicking), the officials, the salesmen, the chimney sweeps, the local gossips, the couple themselves. The man, Konrad, is consumed with his work – a book that is to be both visionary and definitive, the ultimate treatise on the subject of hearing. His wife, a cripple, is the victim of his obsessive experiments: he whispers one phrase in her ear, over and over, hundreds of times, demanding from her impossible degrees of aural discrimination. She has no way of knowing, or no strength to tell herself, whether he is a deluded madman or a genius. For three decades, he has been waiting for the ideal moment, the perfect constellation of circumstances, to arise, so that he may begin writing down his conclusions.
But he never begins, and he is now an old man. We watch as he compulsively invites his own ruin. We feel him creep from one moment to the next, terrified of failure. Suppose he started writing and then caught a cold? Suppose he finished and his tome was judged worthless? Or his wife destroyed it? Even amidst the total isolation of the lime works, where they live, he is continually distracted. He hallucinates about prowlers. He hoards bits of food for dreaded visitors. And she torments him. He must feed her, read to her, bring her cider from the deep cellar (one glass at the time), maintain her voluminous correspondence with servants he has long ago forgotten, try on a mitten she has been knitting and unravelling for years, tend the earaches she develops from constant experiments... until the monotony and heartlessness of their life together shatters in a bloodbath.
Excerpt.
The many voices narrating the novel appear within brackets (and Laska’s is the local tavern):
""...Konrad’s wife, whose maiden name was Zryd, a woman almost totally crippled by decades of taking the wrong medication, and who had consequently spent half her lifetime hunched over in her custom-built French invalid chair, but who is now, as Wieser puts it, out of her misery, was taught by Konrad how to use a Mannlicher carbine, a weapon the otherwise defenseless woman kept out of sight but always within reach, with the safety off, behind her chair, and it was with this gun that Konrad killed her on the night of December 24–25, with two shots in the back of her head (Fro); two shots in the temple (Wieser); abruptly (Fro) putting an end to their marital hell (Wieser). Konrad had always been quick to fire at anything within range of the house, they say at Laska’s, and as everyone knows he did shoot the woodcutter and game keeper Koller who was passing by on his way home from work one evening about four and a half years ago; quite soon after Konrad had moved in, carrying his knapsack and a hoe, and catching it in the left shoulder because Konrad mistook him for a burglar; for which shooting Konrad was in due course sentenced to nine and a half months at hard labor. The incident brought to light about fifteen previous convictions of Konrad’s, mostly for libel and aggravated assault, they say at Laska’s. Konrad served his time in the Wels district prison, where he is being held again right now...""

<doc id="20082214" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20082214" title="Obsessive–compulsive disorder">
Obsessive–compulsive disorder

Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts that produce uneasiness, apprehension, fear, or worry; by repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing the associated anxiety; or by a combination of such obsessions and compulsions. Symptoms of the disorder include excessive washing or cleaning; repeated checking; extreme hoarding; preoccupation with sexual, violent or religious thoughts; relationship-related obsessions; aversion to particular numbers; and nervous rituals, such as opening and closing a door a certain number of times before entering or leaving a room. These symptoms can be alienating and time-consuming, and often cause severe emotional and financial distress. The acts of those who have OCD may appear paranoid and potentially psychotic. However, OCD sufferers generally recognize their obsessions and compulsions as irrational and may become further distressed by this realization.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder affects children and adolescents, as well as adults. Roughly one third to one half of adults with OCD report a childhood onset of the disorder, suggesting the continuum of anxiety disorders across the life span.
The phrase "obsessive–compulsive" has become part of the English lexicon, and is often used in an informal or caricatured manner to describe someone who is excessively meticulous, perfectionistic, absorbed, or otherwise fixated. Although these signs are present in OCD, a person who exhibits them does not necessarily have OCD, but may instead have obsessive–compulsive "personality" disorder (OCPD), an autism spectrum disorder, disorders where perseveration is a possible feature (ADHD, PTSD, bodily disorders or habit problems), or no clinical condition.
Despite the irrational behaviour, OCD is sometimes associated with above-average intelligence. Its sufferers commonly share personality traits such as high attention to detail, avoidance of risk, careful planning, exaggerated sense of responsibility and a tendency to take time in making decisions. Multiple psychological and biological factors may be involved in causing obsessive–compulsive syndromes. Standardized rating scales such as Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale can be used to assess the severity of OCD symptoms.
Signs and symptoms.
Obsessions.
Obsessions are thoughts that recur and persist despite efforts to ignore or confront them. People with OCD frequently perform tasks, or compulsions, to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, vary in their clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying or intrusions related to "relationship rightness." Other obsessions concern the possibility that someone or something other than oneself—such as God, the Devil, or disease—will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about. Other individuals with OCD may experience the sensation of invisible protrusions emanating from their bodies, or have the feeling that inanimate objects are ensouled.
Some people with OCD experience sexual obsessions that may involve intrusive thoughts or images of "kissing, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, incest and rape" with "strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures", and can include "heterosexual or homosexual content" with persons of any age. As with other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, most "normal" people have some disquieting sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach extraordinary significance to the thoughts. For example, obsessive fears about sexual orientation can appear to the person with OCD, and even to those around them, as a crisis of sexual identity. Furthermore, the doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the troubling thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or self-loathing.
People with OCD understand that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, they feel that they must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in compulsive hoarding might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. 
Primarily obsessional.
OCD sometimes manifests without overt compulsions. Nicknamed "Pure-O", or referred to as Primarily Obsessional OCD, OCD without overt compulsions could, by one estimate, characterize as many as 50 percent to 60 percent of OCD cases. Primarily obsessional OCD has been called "one of the most distressing and challenging forms of OCD." People with this form of OCD have "distressing and unwanted thoughts pop into head frequently", and the thoughts "typically center on a fear that you may do something totally uncharacteristic of yourself, something ...potentially fatal...to yourself or others." The thoughts "quite likely, are of an aggressive or sexual nature."
Rather than engaging in observable compulsions, the person with this subtype might perform more covert, mental rituals, or might feel driven to avoid the situations in which particular thoughts seem likely to intrude. As a result of this avoidance, people can struggle to fulfill both public and private roles, even if they place great value on these roles and even if they had fulfilled the roles successfully in the past. Moreover, the individual's avoidance can confuse others who do not know its origin or intended purpose, as it did in the case of a man whose wife began to wonder why he would not hold their infant child. The covert mental rituals can take up a great deal of a person's time during the day.
Compulsions.
Some people with OCD perform compulsive rituals because they inexplicably feel they have to, others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring, or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so idiosyncratic or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive skin picking (i.e., dermatillomania) or hair plucking (i.e., trichotillomania) and nail biting (i.e., onychophagia) are all on the Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum. Individuals with OCD are aware that their thoughts and behavior are not rational, but they feel bound to comply with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.
Some common compulsions include counting specific things (such as footsteps) or in specific ways (for instance, by intervals of two), and doing other repetitive actions, often with atypical sensitivity to numbers or patterns. People might repeatedly wash their hands or clear their throats, make sure certain items are in a straight line, repeatedly check that their parked cars have been locked before leaving them, constantly organize in a certain way, turn lights on and off, keep doors closed at all times, touch objects a certain number of times before exiting a room, walk in a certain routine way like only stepping on a certain color of tile, or have a routine for using stairs, such as always finishing a flight on the same foot.
The compulsions of OCD must be distinguished from tics; movements of other movement disorders such as chorea, dystonia, myoclonus; movements exhibited in stereotypic movement disorder or some people with autism; and the movements of seizure activity. There may exist a notable rate of comorbidity between OCD and tic-related disorders.
People rely on compulsions as an escape from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the intrusive thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.
In addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with antibacterial soap and hot water can make their skin red and raw with dermatitis.
People with OCD can use rationalizations to explain their behavior; however, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is "still" not sure and deems it is "still" better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.
Overvalued ideas.
Some OCD sufferers exhibit what is known as "overvalued ideas". In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do ERP therapy on such patients because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially. There are severe cases in which the sufferer has an unshakeable belief in the context of OCD that is difficult to differentiate from psychosis.
Cognitive performance.
A 2009 study that conducted "a battery of neuropsychological tasks to assess nine cognitive domains with a special focus on executive functions concluded that 'few neuropsychological differences emerged between the OCD and healthy participants when concomitant factors were controlled.'"
A 2013 meta-analysis confirmed OCD patients to have mild but wide-ranging cognitive deficits; significantly regarding spatial memory, to a lesser extent with verbal memory and fluency, while auditory attention was not significantly effected.
Associated conditions.
People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, as well or instead of OCD, such as the aforementioned obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, anorexia nervosa, social anxiety disorder, bulimia nervosa, Tourette syndrome, Asperger syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dermatillomania (compulsive skin picking), body dysmorphic disorder, and trichotillomania (hair pulling). In 2009 it was reported that depression among those with OCD is particularly alarming because their risk of suicide is high; more than 50 percent of patients experience suicidal tendencies, and 15 percent have attempted suicide. Individuals with OCD have also been found to be affected by delayed sleep phase syndrome at a substantially higher rate than the general public.
Behaviorally, there is some research demonstrating a link between drug addiction and the disorder as well. For example, there is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of coping with the heightened levels of anxiety), but drug addiction among OCD patients may serve as a type of compulsive behavior and not just as a coping mechanism. Depression is also extremely prevalent among sufferers of OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson, and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other anxiety disorder) may feel depressed because of an "out of control" type of feeling.
Someone exhibiting OCD signs does not necessarily have OCD. Behaviors that present as (or seem to be) obsessive or compulsive can also be found in a number of other conditions as well, including obsessive–compulsive "personality" disorder (OCPD), autism spectrum disorders, disorders where perseveration is a possible feature (ADHD, PTSD, bodily disorders or habit problems), or sub-clinically.
Some with OCD present with features typically associated with Tourette's syndrome, such as compulsions that may appear to resemble motor tics; this has been termed "tic-related OCD" or "Tourettic OCD".
Causes.
Scholars generally agree that both psychological and biological factors play a role in causing the disorder, although they differ in their degree of emphasis upon either type of factor.
Psychological.
An evolutionary psychology view is that moderate versions of compulsive behavior may have had evolutionary advantages. Examples would be moderate constant checking of hygiene, the hearth, or the environment for enemies. Similarly, hoarding may have had evolutionary advantages. In this view OCD may be the extreme statistical "tail" of such behaviors possibly due to a high amount of predisposing genes.
Biological.
OCD has been linked to abnormalities with the neurotransmitter serotonin, although it could be either a cause or an effect of these abnormalities. Serotonin is thought to have a role in regulating anxiety. To send chemical messages from one neuron to another, serotonin must bind to the receptor sites located on the neighboring nerve cell. It is hypothesized that the serotonin receptors of OCD sufferers may be relatively understimulated. This suggestion is consistent with the observation that many OCD patients benefit from the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a class of antidepressant medications that allow for more serotonin to be readily available to other nerve cells.
A possible genetic mutation may contribute to OCD. A mutation has been found in the human serotonin transporter gene, hSERT, in unrelated families with OCD. Moreover, data from identical twins supports the existence of a "heritable factor for neurotic anxiety". Further, individuals with OCD are more likely to have first-degree family members exhibiting the same disorders than do matched controls. In cases where OCD develops during childhood, there is a much stronger familial link in the disorder than cases in which OCD develops later in adulthood. In general, genetic factors account for 45–65% of OCD symptoms in children diagnosed with the disorder. Environmental factors also play a role in how these anxiety symptoms are expressed; various studies on this topic are in progress and the presence of a genetic link is not yet definitely established.
People with OCD evince increased grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular nuclei, extending to the caudate nuclei, while decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal/anterior cingulate gyri. These findings contrast with those in people with other anxiety disorders, who evince decreased (rather than increased) grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular / caudate nuclei, while also decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal/anterior cingulate gyri. Orbitofrontal cortex overactivity is attenuated in patients who have successfully responded to SSRI medication, a result believed to be caused by increased stimulation of serotonin receptors 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C. The striatum, linked to planning and the initiation of appropriate actions, has also been implicated; mice genetically engineered with a striatal abnormality exhibit OCD-like behavior, grooming themselves three times as frequently as ordinary mice. Recent evidence supports the possibility of a heritable predisposition for neurological development favoring OCD.
Rapid onset of OCD in children and adolescents may be caused by a syndrome conntected to Group A streptococcal infections (PANDAS) or caused by immunologic reactions to other pathogens (PANS).
Neurotransmitters.
Researchers have yet to pinpoint the exact cause of OCD, but brain differences, genetic influences, and environmental factors are being studied. Brain scans of people with OCD have shown that they have different patterns of brain activity than people without OCD and that different functioning of circuitry within a certain part of the brain, the striatum, may cause the disorder. Differences in other parts of the brain and neurotransmitter dysregulation, especially serotonin and dopamine, may also contribute to OCD. Independent studies have consistently found unusual dopamine and serotonin activity in various regions of the brain in individuals with OCD. These can be defined as dopaminergic in the prefrontal cortex and serotonergic in the basal ganglia. Glutamate dysregulation has also been the subject of recent research, although its role in the disorder's etiology is not yet clear.
Diagnosis.
Formal diagnosis may be performed by a psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or other licensed mental health professional. To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize clinically significant obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses, or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the normal range of worries about conventional problems. A person may attempt to ignore or suppress such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.
Compulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD "must" perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.
Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational, or scholastic functioning. It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the patient’s estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, Fenske and Schwenk in their article "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Diagnosis and Management," argue that more concrete tools should be used to gauge the patient’s condition (2009). This may be done with rating scales, such as the most trusted Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.
OCD vs. OCPD.
OCD is often confused with the separate condition obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). OCD is "ego dystonic", meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept. Because ego dystonic disorders go against a person's self-concept, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is "ego syntonic"—marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with his or her self-image, or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.
As a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them, and may be riddled with anxiety. By contrast people with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise, and they tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions.
OCD vs. other conditions.
OCD is different from behaviors such as gambling addiction and overeating. People with these disorders typically experience at least some pleasure from their activity; OCD sufferers do not actively want to perform their compulsive tasks and experience no pleasure from doing so.
Management.
Behavioral therapy (BT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and medications are first-line treatments for OCD. Psychodynamic psychotherapy may help in managing some aspects of the disorder. The American Psychiatric Association notes a lack of controlled demonstrations that psychoanalysis or dynamic psychotherapy is effective "in dealing with the core symptoms of OCD." The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to stigma associated with OCD.
Behavioral therapy.
The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called exposure and ritual prevention (also known as "exposure and response prevention") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly "contaminated" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a "contaminated" location, such as a school.) That is the "exposure". The "ritual prevention" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly habituates to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more "contaminated" or not checking the lock at all—again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.
Exposure ritual/response prevention (ERP) has a strong evidence base. It is considered the most effective treatment for OCD. However, this claim has been doubted by some researchers criticizing the quality of many studies.
It has generally been accepted that psychotherapy, in combination with psychiatric medication, is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone.
Medication.
Medications as treatment include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the tricyclic antidepressants, in particular clomipramine.
Treatment of OCD is an area needing significant improvement in prescribing regimens. Benzodiazepines are sometimes used, although they are generally believed to be ineffective for treating OCD; however, effectiveness was found in one small study. In most cases antidepressant therapy alone provides only a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that affect the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate or the binding to its receptors. These include riluzole, memantine, gabapentin, N-Acetylcysteine, and lamotrigine.
The atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine have also been found to be useful as adjuncts to an SSRI in treatment-resistant OCD. However, these drugs are often poorly tolerated, and have metabolic side effects that limit their use. None of the atypical antipsychotics appear to be useful when used alone.
Electroconvulsive therapy.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been found to have effectiveness in some severe and refractory cases.
Psychosurgery.
For some, medication, support groups and psychological treatments fail to alleviate obsessive–compulsive symptoms. These patients may choose to undergo psychosurgery as a last resort. In this procedure, a surgical lesion is made in an area of the brain (the cingulate cortex). In one study, 30% of participants benefited significantly from this procedure. Deep-brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation are possible surgical options that do not require destruction of brain tissue. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration approved deep-brain stimulation for the treatment of OCD under a humanitarian device exemption requiring that the procedure be performed only in a hospital with specialist qualifications to do so.
In the US, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the patient has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive cognitive–behavioral therapy with exposure and ritual/response prevention. Likewise, in the United Kingdom, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive–behavioral therapist has been carried out.
Children.
Therapeutic treatment may be effective in reducing ritual behaviors of OCD for children and adolescents. Family involvement, in the form of behavioral observations and reports, is a key component to the success of such treatments. Parental intervention also provides positive reinforcement for a child who exhibits appropriate behaviors as alternatives to compulsive responses. After one or two years of therapy, in which a child learns the nature of his or her obsession and acquires strategies for coping, that child may acquire a larger circle of friends, exhibit less shyness, and become less self-critical.
Although the causes of OCD in younger age groups range from brain abnormalities to psychological preoccupations, life stress such as bullying and traumatic familial deaths may also contribute to childhood cases of OCD, and acknowledging these stressors can play a role in treating the disorder.
Epidemiology.
[[File:Obsessive-compulsive disorder world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|Age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates for obsessive-compulsive disorder per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.
OCD occurs in between 1 to 3% of children and adults. It occurs equally in both sexes. In 80% of cases, symptoms present before the age of 18. A 2000 study by the World Health Organization found some variety in prevalence and incidence of OCD around the world, with figures in Latin America, Africa, and Europe at two to three times those in Asia and Oceania.
One Canadian study found that prevalence of OCD had little correlation with race. However, respondents who marked Judaism as their religion were overrepresented among OCD patients.
Prognosis.
Psychological interventions such as behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy as well as pharmacological treatment can lead to substantial reduction of OCD symptoms for the average patient. However, OCD symptoms persist at moderate levels even following adequate treatment course and a completely symptom-free period is uncommon.
History.
From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual, or other obsessive thoughts were possessed by the Devil. Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the "evil" from the "possessed" person through exorcism.
In the early 1910s, Sigmund Freud attributed obsessive–compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts that manifest as symptoms. Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of "touching phobia" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an "external prohibition" against this type of touching. However, this "prohibition does not succeed in abolishing" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and "force it into the unconscious".
Society and culture.
Movies and television often portray idealized representations of disorders such as OCD. These depictions may lead to increased public awareness, understanding, and sympathy for such disorders.
Research.
The naturally occurring sugar inositol has been suggested as a treatment for OCD.
Nutrition deficiencies may also contribute to OCD and other mental disorders. Vitamin and mineral supplements may aid in such disorders and provide nutrients necessary for proper mental functioning.
μ-Opioids, such as hydrocodone and tramadol, may improve OCD symptoms. Administration of opiate treatment may be contraindicated in individuals concurrently taking CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine and paroxetine.

Tzvia Greenfeld

Tzvia Greenfeld (, born 1945) is an Israeli politician and a former member of the Knesset for Meretz.
Biography.
Greenfeld was born in Jerusalem in 1945. She grew up in an ultra-orthodox home and attended Beis Yaakov schools. She earned an MA in philosophy and history at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a PhD in political philosophy. She has been politically active since the 1990s. In 1993, she established the Mifneh ["pivot point"] Institute for education toward peace, tolerance, and democracy in Orthodox society. She was among the founders of Orthodox Women for the Sanctity of Life, which opposed the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon. Greenfeld is a member of the Board of Directors of B'tselem and was among the signatories of the Geneva accords. She wrote the book They're Afraid': How the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Became the Leading Force in Israel". She lives in Har Nof and her five children attend Orthodox Zionist schools.
In 2006 she decided to pursue a parliamentary career. She was on the Meretz list for the 17th Knesset and was ranked sixth in an internal vote by 700 of Meretz's 1,000 central committee members, after Chair Yossi Beilin, Ran Cohen, Avshalom Vilan, Zehava Gal-On, and Haim Oron. Meretz received five seats. On 4 November 2008 Greenfeld replaced Beilin, who retired from politics, and became the first ultra-Orthodox woman sworn into the Knesset. Prior to the 2009 elections she again won sixth place on the Meretz list. However, she lost her seat in the February 2009 elections, as the party was reduced to three seats.
Greenfeld opposes the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict along the Green Line with "minor adjustments". She describes herself as a social democrat and a supporter of a strong welfare state. She does not follow any rabbis, claiming that contemporary Israeli rabbis do not advance the interests of their followers. She also accused them of not preparing their followers for the disengagement plan. She remains Orthodox, rather than choosing Reform Judaism or Conservative Judaism because she believes in continuity, feels close to Jewish tradition and history, and is committed to observing Halacha.
Greenfeld considers herself an Orthodox woman with similar values to those of the United States and Europe, accepting separation of church and state, which she believes is necessary in Israel as well in order to save Judaism. She supports gay rights and gay marriage. In her book, she accuses the Orthodox of using child benefits as a source of income. She does not use elevators on Shabbat and had a pet dog. She has stirred controversy among the ultra-Orthodox, and ultra-Orthodox journalist Kobi Arieli wrote that she is not truly ultra-Orthodox because she had a dog, and that real ultra-Orthodox hate Meretz.

Carfax Conduit

The Carfax Conduit was a water conduit that supplied the city of Oxford with water from 1617 until the 19th century.
The conduit ran in an underground lead pipe from a spring on the hillside above the village of North Hinksey, beneath Seacourt Stream and the River Thames, to a building at Carfax in the centre of Oxford. The system was built by Otto Nicholson, a London lawyer, to supply the citizens of Oxford with clean water. It replaced a system built by Osney Abbey between 1205 and 1221 that had fallen into disrepair.
The conduit building at Carfax was an elaborate structure, some tall, with eight niches containing statues of historic and mythical figures. By 1787 it had become an obstacle to traffic and it was removed and replaced by a smaller cistern. The original structure was given to the Earl Harcourt, who had it re-erected in the grounds of his home, Nuneham House, where it remains to this day.
A building, now called the Conduit House, was built at Harcourt Hill over the spring. It remains "in situ" and is in the care of English Heritage.
The entire system fell into disuse in the 19th century. In 1869, when it was carrying very little water, the conduit was sold to Oxford Corporation.

Frederick Gugenheim Gregory

Frederick Gugenheim Gregory (22 December 1893–27 November 1961) was a British botanist, plant physiologist and winner of the Royal Medal.
Education and early life.
Gregory was born Fritz Gugenheim in London, but changed his name as a result of the anti-German sentiment during the First World War, which culminated in the destruction of his laboratory notebooks by colleagues at the Cheshunt Experimental Station. He first studied at Dame Alice Owen's School, where he was persuaded by the school science master, G. A. Armitage that he should go into science, despite his artistic skills. He left the school at the top of his class with a number of prizes and passed the intermediate exam for the University of London in mathematics, physics, chemistry and mechanics in 1912, gaining acceptance into Imperial College London.
Gregory intention when applying had been to study chemistry, but after attending a lecture by John Bretland Farmer he switched to botany, gaining his ARCS in 1914 and BSc in 1915, both with first class honours, and also won the Forbes prize. Having been exempted from service in World War I he gained his DIC in 1917, and followed this up with an MSc in 1920 and the DSc in 1921. By this point he had joined the Research Institute in Plant Physiology at the university, and began investigating the physiology of greenhouse crops at the Cheshunt Experimental Station. While there he noticed differences in how a plant grew at different times in the year but under a constant temperature, and attempted to express this in mathematical terms using very speculative evidence; the resulting arguments made him prominent within the field.
Career.
After the completion of these studie, Gregory began working on the effects of electric current on plant growth under Vernon Blackman but remained interested in the study of growth, and began experimenting with that in 1919 at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, something he continued until 1937. By 1928 his work was visible and important enough that he was asked to advise the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation on their irrigation techniques in Sudan, setting up statistical studies so helpful that his final report was widely used in the development of agronomy within the country. When Blackman was appointed head of the biological laboratories at Imperial College Gregory was made assistant professor of plant physiology and assistant director of the research institute, resulting in him (for the first time in his career) having to give lectures at the university. Under Gregory the research institute became known for its work investigating vernalization, photoperiodism, transpiration and carbohydrate metabolism, with Gregory in high demand as an advisor both at the university and its various research institutes.
After Blackman's retirement in 1937 Gregory was made head of the laboratories, although work at the university was heavily disrupted by World War II. In 1947 Gregory was appointed head of the research institute as well, and focused on repairing damage from the war. This period saw increased appreciation of Gregory as a scientist; he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1940, serving on its council from 1949 to 1951 and was awarded the Royal Medal in 1957 'In recognition of his distinguished studies in plant physiology.' Around the same time he was also elected a foreign member of the Indian Society of Plant Physiologists and the United States National Academy of Sciences. He retired in December 1958, and died in Hampstead General Hospital, London on 27 November 1961.

NMS Delfinul

NMS "Delfinul" ("Dolphin") was a Romanian submarine that served in the Black Sea during the Second World War. It was the first submarine bought by the Romanian Navy. It was an improved design from the First World War, having fitted a snorkel for underwater diesel operation.
The birth.
NMS "Delfinul" was built in 1930 at the Italian naval base and shipyard, Fiume (today, Rijeka in Croatia), by ""Construzzione navale dello stato"". On the 5 May 1936 (six years after it was built because of little misunderstandings between the Italian shipyard and the Romanian government), the submarine was launched to sea, in front of Romanian and Italian naval engineers. During its first years of service, "Delfinul" fulfilled training and exercise missions in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.
Role in World War II.
"Delfinul" played an important role in the Black Sea war against the Soviet Union in World War II. Its home base was the Constanţa Naval Base, from where the submarine completed nine war time patrols. When Romania entered the war (22 June 1941), the navy had only one submarine, but that presence meant that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet had to secure an anti-submarine service for its convoys and near its naval bases. As a fleet in being, the "Delfinul" had only to exist rather than taking part in the battles. It was kept under shelter in Constanţa and rarely got out to do a reconnaissance mission. That changed when two modern (for that time) submarines arrived from Germany ("Rechinul"-"The Shark" and "Marsuinul"-"The Sea Hog").
Patrol 1.
Capitan (USN rank - lieutenant) Constantin Costachescu commanded "Delfinul" on its first war patrol which lasted 22–27 June 1941. A simple reconnaissance mission from shore. On 26 June at 00:30, the Costachescu reported back to Constanţa that a large Soviet war group was approaching Constanţa. Because they lost their element of surprise, the Soviets lost a destroyer ("Moskva") and the lead ship "Kharkov" and the cruiser "Voroshilov" were damaged in the following battle.
Patrol 2.
The next patrol took place from 10–20 July, under the command of Capitan (USN rank - Lieutenant) Corneliu Lungu. "Delfinul" patrolled the south of the Crimean peninsula and made a reconnaissance mission in Novorosiisk, trying to evaluate the anti-aircraft and anti-submarine capabilities of the enemy naval base. On 13 July it was south west of Cape Idokopas, and on 15 July it reached the south of Feodosiya. In that area, they spotted an enemy ship, but it vanished shortly after. During the night it was detected by an enemy patrol craft. It quickly submerged and it wasn't attacked. On 16 July, the gyro compass broke down and the submarine began its journey for home. from Cape Sabla, they spotted a small Russian submarine on the surface, probably from the "Malyutka" class. They tried to attack it with the deck gun, but the rough seas and two unidentified hydroplanes determined the commanding officer to dive the boat and break contact.
On 30 July, "Delfinul" was scheduled to start another patrol, at 16:00 (4:00 pm). But an engine malfunction made it return to port at 19:00 (7:00 pm).
Patrol 3.
On the third patrol (12–20 August 1941), "Delfinul" returned under the command of Capitan Costachescu. Its mission, to attack the convoys leaving or arriving at Odessa. They only had two poor chances to attack anything, on the night of 13–14 August and on 19 August, but they could not maintain contact. The sector was abundant in enemy patrol crafts and hydroplanes. The submarine also made a reconnaissance mission of the coast of Crimea, and, on the way home, they were attacked by the M-33 submarine. The torpedo overshot, and when the M-33 surfaced, it was attacked with the machine gun.
Patrol 4.
The 4th patrol (3–19 September), took "Delfinul" deeper in enemy controlled waters. This time, the chance to attack surface vessels really presented itself. After spotting two convoys which "Delfinul" couldn't follow, on the 9 September, at 9:35, it was detected on the surface by a cruiser, which Capitan (USN rank - Lieutenant) Corneliu Lungu identified as the Komintern. The submarine carefully maneuvered because of the underwater rocks. In the following days, the submarine had some chances of attack but the rough seas made it impossible. On the 10 September, the submarine got into firing range from a 2 ship convoy 20 NM west from Cape Otrishenok, but the charge of an escort vessel forced Capitan Lungu to submerge and lose contact. Another chance presented itself on the 16 September at 5:05 west of Novorosiisk, in the form of a Russian tanker and its escort. But the escort spotted the periscope. When they rose the periscope again, the CO saw that the escort called for help so he submerged and left the area, following the directive to take no chances with the escorts. On the 17 September it took a course for Constanţa, and, on the way back, it was spotted by a number of Russian hydroplanes and even depth charged by a patrol craft.
Patrol 5.
The fifth patrol took place between the 2 and 7 November 1941 and it is the patrol when the only attack of "Delfinul" took place. Its mission, the attack of the convoys destined for Sevastopol. Its CO was Constantin Costachescu. Near Constanţa they spotted an enemy submarine, but because of the darkness, they lost it. On the morning of the 5 September the submarine reached the neighboring waters of Ialta. At 6:36 they spotted a patrol vessel and kept watch. Around 8:05, sub-lieutenant Constantin Stegaru spotted a big transport vessel on a course of 290, steaming for Ialta. At 8:15, the ship turned to the left closing on the submarine. The CO decided to wait for the ship to pass behind him and shot from an aft tube. At 8:43, "Delfinul" launched a torpedo from tube 6, from 800 meters (2624 feet, 874 yards) away. The torpedo explosion, followed by a bigger one could be heard, moment after the launch. It is possible that the ship wasn't escorted because the first contact with a submarine hunter ship came in an hour after the attack. The depth charging lasted from 10:30 until 18:30 (6:30 pm). There were 23 passes and 80 to 90 explosions from depth charges. During the attack, Capitan (USN rank - Lieutenant) Constantin Costachescu dove the submarine deeper and deeper, and the enemy was listening, he would stop the submarine's machinery. Afterwards they went near the Turkish coast, but a dreadful storm made the trip home a difficult venture.
Capitan (USN rank - Lieutenant) Constantin Costachescu was latter awarded the Order of Mihai the Brave 3rd Class for the attack. Romanian historians identified the sunken ship as being the cargo boat "Uralles" (1975 tonnes), but the soviet archives state that the "Uralles" was sunk by Luftwaffe bombs in the port of Eupatoria on the 29 October. The identity of the ship is still in debate.
Patrol 6.
The mission of the sixth patrol was to cut the Russian communication routes between Batumi and Istanbul. "Delfinul" left port on the 30 November, but because of bad weather, it was forced to return to base on the 3 December 1941.
Patrol 7.
The seventh patrol (6–13 December) took "Delfinul" back to the Batumi-Istambul line. It didn't detect any enemy convoys. On its way back, it detected two Russian submarines near Constanţa.
Patrol 8.
The first patrol of 1942 (18–30 May) found "Delfinul" under the command of Locotenent Comandor (USN rank - Lieutenant Commander) Constantin Lungu, who had been promoted. It patrolled the north side of the Turkish coast without detecting anything. It was attacked by two Russian planes on the 27 May, without sustaining any damage.
Patrol 9.
The last patrol of "Delfinul" (25 June – 3 July 1942) was carried in the area est of Yalta. On the 27 June they arrived in the operation theatre but were forced to stay submerged because of enemy aircraft. Between 4:26 and 15:30 (3:30 pm) "Delfinul" was the target of 240 anti submarine bombs. A fuel tank cracked. After 16:00 (4:00 pm) enemy patrol crafts appeared, and Capitan (USN rank - Lieutenant) Costachescu ordered a full stop on the electric motors. The next day, the submarine was spotted on the surface by an enemy aircraft at 16:12 (4:12 pm). Some gun bullets damaged its conning tower. On the 1 July, the last day of the Sevastopol evacuation, the Russian flotilla was very active in the Crimean zone, so "Delfinul" was spotted and hunted for 13 hours. Between 7:35 and 10:30 there were counted 107 depth charges. Around 13:00 (1:00 pm) there was an attack with 20 bombs, and at 15:40 (3:40 pm) another 24. In the evening, between 19:30 (7:30 pm) and 20:00 (8:00 pm), 82 depth charges and bombs exploded near the submarine and 35 away from it. In total 268 explosions, mainly air dropped anti submarine bombs and few depth charges. It entered capital repairs after it got back from this patrol.
The end.
On the 23 August 1944 it was confiscated by the Soviet Union. After a long period of time it was returned heavily damaged. It was never repaired and it never got back on the sea.
The legacy.
The name "Delfinul" was passed to the only Romanian Navy submarine still in service today. It was bought from the Russians in the 1980s and it's an improved diesel-electric attack Kilo class submarine. The new "Delfinul" is still waiting for its new battery packs since the early '90s.
"Audaces Fortuna Juvat".
"Delfinul" is the most successful Romanian submarine of all time. The Romanian Submarine Service had as motto the Latin expression: "Audaces Fortuna Juvat" which means "Luck stays with the Brave" ("rom."-""Norocul îi ajutǎ pe cei îndrǎzneţi"").

Castel Cellesi

Castel Cellesi is a tiny Italian village located in the area of Tuscia at the meeting point of Northern Lazio, Umbria and Tuscany. It is a "frazione" of Bagnoregio, in the Province of Viterbo.
Overview.
Castel Cellesi was originally an enclosed square structure composed of small farm houses which surrounded a larger open space accessible through two main gates known as the “Upper Gate” and the “Lower Gate.” The Church and the Palace of Count Girolamo Cellesi were in the center of the village.
Gradually more farmers joined the first settlers and the village spread out of its lower gate. Another large square was then added on, rectangular in shape, encircled by small houses which all looked alike in color, shape and size. Count Cellesi had decreed that no building could be erected higher than the second floor of his own palace.
In the older of the two squares, one finds the Parish Church dedicated to Saint Girolamo. Its construction was commissioned by Count Girolamo Cellesi in 1664 and his monumental tomb is on the right hand wall entering the church. The building was restored and decorated with large frescoes in the late 19th century.
The interior of the church has only one nave, covered with a wood beam roof and three steps lead to the altar where the statue of St. Girolamo is located. A large wooden statue of the Virgin Mary in the Assumption into Heaven, highly venerated in Castelcellesi, is located on the left of the altar.
The most important monument of the village is the small church named after the Holy Sepulchre, founded by Count Girolamo Cellesi around 1674. It originates as a very modest chapel dedicated to the Madonna del Soccorso. Later, in 1703, another Count Cellesi, Francesco, had requested some Holy Relics from the Great Custodian of the Holy Land and started reconstruction of the chapel, enlarging it to twice its original size.
During the renovation, a large rock slab was found in the center of the new church site. Since it was not possible to remove it, they decided to erect a Shrine around it shaped like the Holy Sepulchre in the Holy Land. The Holy Relics arrived at Castel Cellesi at the end of February 1704 and were placed in the Shrine. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was officially consecrated by the Bishop on March 7, 1704.
A Brotherhood was founded to take care of the Holy Sepulchre and of the Church. For almost two centuries, until the end of the 19th century, the Holy Sepulchre of Castelcellesi was the destination of countless pilgrims coming from all over the Tiber valley. Even today it is one of the most important sites on the itinerary “Shrines of the Holy Sepulchre in Europe.”

VRPM

vRPM, or virtual Revolutions Per Minute, is a term for a synthetic measurement of performance introduced by SanDisk for solid state drive (SSD) storage devices inside client PCs. vRPM was created to give users a metric to compare SSD performance to the hard disk drive (HDD) and to other SSDs. It answers the question: "How fast would you have to spin a virtual HDD to achieve the performance of an SSD in a client PC?" It uses a language that users understand, RPM or Revolutions Per Minute, that is a defacto industry standard to measure the performance of the HDD inside PCs.
Comparing SSD vs. HDD Input/Output Operation.
The performance of a storage device can be quantified as the number of Input/Output operations Per Second (IOPS) it achieves. HDD IOPS is proportional to RPM. When a system requests to read/write data randomly from/to a HDD, seek time and rotational latency are two HDD activities that significantly reduce HDD IOPS. Seek time is the time it takes to move the HDD head to the correct cylinder to begin to receive data. Rotational latency is the time it takes to rotate the HDD platter beneath the head so that the data can be read/written. Rotational latency varies based on the RPM of the HDD.
NAND flash is used as the non-volatile memory inside SSDs. 
It has faster random read than random write performance, since its write performance is delayed by the need to perform garbage collection to free space for writing. However, since NAND flash has no moving parts, the SSD achieves much higher IOPS than a HDD.
For the client PC usage model with approximately a 50:50 read/write ratio, a PC IOPS number can be calculated as follows:
Using this equation, the results for client SSD PC performance are as follows: 
Converting SSD IOPS Rates into vRPM.
The vRPM performance of an SSD can be calculated as follows:
where
Using this calculation, SSD vRPM rates can be shown to be significantly better than HDD RPM rates, particularly in later generation SSDs: 
vRPM Adoption In Industry.
Despite its early objectives, vRPM has not become broadly supported in the industry and indeed no longer appears on SanDisk's SSD website.

Fluorenol

Fluorenol is an alcohol derivative of fluorene. In the most significant isomer, fluoren-9-ol or 9-hydroxyfluorene, the hydroxy group is located on the bridging carbon between the two benzene rings. Hydroxyfluorene can be converted to fluorenone by oxidation. It is a white-cream colored solid at room temperature. It does not have known toxicity or carcinogenicity in humans.
Fluorenol was patented as an insecticide in 1939, and is an algaecide against the green algae "Dunaliella bioculata".
Eugeroic.
A study published by chemists working for the biopharmaceutical company Cephalon to develop a successor to the anti-narcolepsy drug modafinil reported that fluorenol was 39% more effective than modafinil at keeping mice awake over a 4 hour period. It is a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor with an IC50 of 9 μM, notably 59% weaker than modafinil despite being a stronger eugeroic, potentially making it even less addictive. It also showed no affinity for cytochrome P450 2C19, unlike modafinil. No human trials have yet been published as of 2014.

Mureş Floodplain Natural Park

The Mureș Floodplain Natural Park, set aside by the Romanian government in 2005, is located in western Romania outside the city of Arad. The park covers 17,455 ha and follows the Mureş River westward from the city of Arad to the Hungarian border. The park is a typical ecosystem for wetlands, with running and still waters, and is subjected to periodical floods (a flood every three years). The forests (7,500 ha) in the park are made up primarily of common oak, narrow-leafed ash, black and white poplar, white willow, and American black walnut. This area is an important place for nesting and passage for nearly 200 species of birds, most of which are strictly protected internationally.
The main purpose of the Mureș Floodplain Natural Park is to protect and preserve the habitats and landscape diversity from the region. The park has been designated a RAMSAR site, and under Natura 2000, the park was designated a SPA (Special Protection Area) for birds, and a SAC (Special Area of Conservation) for other species and habitats. Within the park, there are 4 strictly protected natural reserves: The Cenad Forest (310.5 ha), Big Isle of Cenad (2.1 ha), Igriș Islands (7 ha), and Prundul Mare (717.9 ha).
The park is a sister park with the Körös-Maros National Park, in Hungary. The two parks border each other and have created a cross-border protected area with a future common management plan.
Biology.
The Mureș Floodplain Natural Park has an ecosystem that is typical for wetlands, with running and still waters, large forests and periodic floods (every several years).
Flora.
The vegetation in the park grows in a continental climate, with warm summers and moderate winters. The annual average temperature is 10.5 degrees Celsius and the average annual rainfall is 550 mm. Many plants within the park need the periodic flooding in order to germinate and to consume the nutrients freshly dissolved in the water. 
A large number of plants in the park are on “the red list of superior plants in Romania”, meaning they are vulnerable or rare species. Some of these include: yarrow ("Achillea thracica"), Water soldier ("Stratiotes alloides"), common corncockle ("Agrostemma githago"), "Cirsium brachycephalum", prostrate false pimpernel ("Lindernia procumbens"), brittle waternymph ("Najas minor"), hog’s fennel ("Peucedanum officinale"), lesser Butterfly-orchid ("Platanthera bifolia"), Scottish dock ("Rumex aquaticus"), French vetch ("Vicia narbonensis L. ssp. serratifolia"). 
Besides this, there are also three species which are strictly protected according to the Bern Convention: European waterclover ("Marsilea quadrifolia"), floating watermoss ("Salvinia natans"), water caltrop ("Trapa natans").
Stands of oak ("Quercus robur") and ash ("Fraxinus angustifolia") are predominant in the park, together with the coppices of black and white poplar ("Populus nigra" and "Populus alba") and white willow (Salix alba). These species are mostly found in the small forest in the Cenad area and in the 6,000 ha forest along the Mureș River between Arad and the village of Semlac (which includes the Ceala Forest).
Fauna.
The fauna in the park encompasses a multitude of species, from large mammals to species living on the river bottom.
There are large populations of mammal species living within the park. Among these are: European hamster ("Cricetus cricetus"), European polecat ("Mustela putorius"), brown long-eared bat ("Plecotus auritus"), otter ("Lutra lutra"), European wildcat ("Felix sylvestris"), red fox ("Vulpes vulpes"), red deer ("Cervus elaphus"), wild boar ("Sus scrofa"), fallow deer ("Dama dama") and roe deer ("Capreolus capreolus").
In 1988, the area which is now the Mureș Floodplain Natural Park was designated as an “Important Bird Area” because of the existence of numerous bird species. Nearly all the birds living in The Mures Floodplain Natural Park are included in the annexes of the Bern Convention and the EU’s Habitats Directive. Among them is the lesser spotted eagle ("Aquila pomarina"), whose numbers within the park are low, but which was chosen as symbol of the natural park. 
Approximately 200 species of birds live or pass through the park every year. Among these are: great cormorants ("Phalacrocorax carbo"), black-crowned night-heron ("Nycticorax nycticorax"), grey heron ("Ardea cinerea"), mallard ("Anas platyrhynchos"), black-headed gull ("Larus ridibundus"), Eurasian coot ("Fulica atra"), little bittern ("Ixobrychus minutus"), little grebe ("Tachybaptus ruficollis"), water rail ("Rallus aquaticus"), European bee-eater ("Merops apiaster"). 
There is also a very large number of sand martins ("Riparia riparia"). Nearly half of the entire population of sand martins on the Mureș River can be found within the Mureș Floodplain Natural Park.
All six of the species of reptiles and nine species of amphibians identified within the park are mentioned in the annexes of the Bern Convention and the EU’s Habitats Directive. Their inclusion in these lists is due to the regress of these species, which are considered barometers for the state of an ecosystem’s health. Among these are: European pond terrapin ("Emys orbicularis"), dice snake ("Natrix tessellata"), European fire-bellied toad ("Bombina bombina"), and the great crested newt ("Triturus cristatus"). 
For the fish species in the park, the periodic flooding of the Mureș River is a blessing; this process provides new spawning grounds, as well as generating new food and protection. The ichthyofauna in the park has a rich diversity and contains more fish species than any other section of the Mureș River. It is only in this section of the Mureș River that some species exist: white-eye bream ("Abramis sapa"), zarte ("Vimba vimba"), crucian carp ("Carassius carassius"), brown bullhead ("Ameiurus nebulosus"), striped ruffe ("Gymnocephalus schraetser"), zingel ("Zingel zingel").
Recreation/tourism.
Because of the proximity of the park to so many municipalities, the area that is now the Mureș Floodplain Natural Park has been used for recreation for centuries. Throughout time, local citizens have depended on this area for both recreation and to sustain their lives. The creation of the park in 2005, insures this will continue in the future, but with oversight and regulations. The most visited areas of the park are the Ceala Forest (due to its proximity to the city of Arad) and the Bezdin area (widely known as the most natural section of the park).
The Ceala Forest Visitor's Center.
Between 2001-2005, the Mureș Floodplain Natural Park implemented, at what was then the largest PHARE grant in Romania (co-financed for 2.6 million Euros). Among other infrastructure projects, this grant built the park’s current visitor’s center. 
In May 2007, the Ceala Forest Visitor’s Center, just outside the city of Arad, had its grand opening. The building houses a 34 bed hotel, a conference room that seats up to 70 people, a kitchen and dining area, a laboratory, and the park’s administrative offices.
Eco-tourism.
The park’s eco-tourism program has two components: a guided/unguided canoe trip on the Mures River from the city of Arad to the town of Pecica; and bicycle rentals to be used on the park’s bicycle trail network. Both are extremely popular during the spring and summer months.
Cultural.
There are three monasteries within the park boundaries. All three monasteries are owned and operated by their respective churches, but due to their proximity to the Mureș River and its important ecosystem, these lands fall under the supervision and protection of the Mureș Floodplain Natural Park.
On the northern side of the river is the Saint Paraschiva Monastery, which can be found just outside the village of Bodrogu Vechi. This is the newest monastery in the park and is accessed from the town of Pecica.
On the southern side of the river are other two monasteries. Hodoș-Bodrog Monastery (commonly known as Bodrog Monastery), dating from 1177, is one of the oldest monastic institutions in the Romanian Orthodox Church. The monastery is accessible from the village of Bodrogu Nou and is 17 km from the city of Arad. The monastery is active and has many monks living and working there.
The Bezdin Monastery, dating from 1539, is one of the few Serbian Orthodox monasteries in Romania which is still preserved. In comparison to Hodoș-Bodrog Monastery, Bezdin is very isolated and is situated in what is considered the most natural part of the Mureș Floodplain Natural Park. The monastery is accessible from the commune of Munar and is 31 km from the city of Arad.
Bird watching and wildlife viewing.
Because of the rich bird life within the park, the park administration constructed two structures in the Bezdin area. In 2004, the park erected a wildlife viewing tower in an area of the forest that is known to have wildlife viewing potential. In 2005, the park erected a bird watching tower near the Bezdin marsh. Both of these towers are accessible from the Bezdin Monastery and the commune of Munar.
Hunting and fishing.
Hunting is allowed within the park during certain seasons and in specific areas. Fishing is also allowed, but only with a fishing license.
Environmental education.
Because of the close proximity to a large city and the potentially large impact this causes the park, the park’s environmental education program grew rapidly in the first three years in existence: 100 students (2006), 900 students (2007), and over 2,000 students (2008). 
The park administration was trained by Outward Bound Romania on experiential education strategies in the summer of 2007. The park has the Romanian park system’s first low ropes course and has received notoriety in Romanian national news and within the park system for its education efforts.

West Kowloon Terminus

West Kowloon Terminus (WKT) is the terminus of the Hong Kong Section of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL), and is currently under construction. It is the only station in the Hong Kong Section and will connect to the mainland China section through a dedicated tunnel. It is being constructed by the MTR Corporation.
Aedas in collaboration with AECOM has been awarded the contract to design the multi-story terminus.
WKT will be located in Jordan, Kowloon, north of the proposed West Kowloon Cultural District between the Airport Express and Tung Chung Line Kowloon Station and the West Rail Line Austin Station, extending into the underground area of the West Kowloon Cultural District. It will be commissioned in 2014 at the earliest.
Structure.
Construction of the West Kowloon Terminus project was divided into two parts, XRL810A ( northern part ) and XRL810B ( southern part ) (XRL meaning e"X"press "R"ail Link). The northern construction area was awarded to Leighton Contractors & Gammon Construction(Golden Gate) responsible for joint operations. The southern part of the project was awarded to a consortium of Laing O'Rourke, HCCG(Xinchang) & Paul Y jointly responsible for the construction.
West Kowloon Terminus features 9 long distance platforms and 6 short haul regional platforms for a total of 15 platforms. In addition, as a cross-border railway railway station, West Kowloon Terminus will also be set up with Hong Kong Customs and Immigration facilities for the passengers to go through the formalities prior to boarding the train and not requiring any stops at the Hong Kong border.
Green Belt.
West Kowloon Terminus will feature an extensive green garden and parklands across the roof area of the station. It will also set up a large collection of cultural elements and entertainment spaces. Passengers can easily cross the ground floor between Kowloon Station, Austin Station and West Kowloon Cultural District, providing Hong Kong residents and visitors ample public open space and a comfortable green walking environment. Above the station, an area of approximately 8,900 square metres will be planted with a large number of plants and trees with traffic separated. All to create a pedestrian area, a green platform and wooded park that will integrate with the West Kowloon Cultural District harbourside parklands.
In addition, the West Kowloon Terminus entrance lobby area will feature a green ecological leisure channel zone to tie in with the greenery on top of the building.
Train services.
The West Kowloon Terminus will be served by both short distance services and long distance train services. Short distance services consist a frequency service to neighbouring Guangdong province, mainland China cities including Shenzhen, Dongguan and Guangzhou, while long distance services link Hong Kong with at least 16 major destinations in mainland China. Six platforms will be designated for short haul trains, while nine will be designated for long haul trains.
Short distance services
Long haul services
According to a 2008 study, it is expected that by 2030, train services will increace in frequency.
It is expected that by 2016, the West Kowloon Terminus daily number of passengers carried will be about 99,000 passengers.
Transport links.
MTR.
West Kowloon Terminus is located between two MTR stations, Kowloon Station and Austin Station. It is intended to develop into commuter hub as the goal. Passengers can gain transfer through the ground pedestrian area, a number of footbridges and subways to connect with the MTR Kowloon Station and Austin Station. It is expected that a walk from Kowloon Station to West Kowloon Terminus Station will require 8–10 minutes, transfer to/from Austin station needs only 2–3 minutes.
From the West Kowloon Terminus via the MTR to the various regions of Hong Kong :
Public Interchange.
In addition, at the northern terminus in West Kowloon will set up a public transport interchange and long-distance coach berthing facilities. Walking from the West Kowloon Terminus to these facilities only takes one minute. Passengers can use different modes of transport to reach for the bus station, minibus station and taxi stand.
Time needed to travel to/from West Kowloon Terminus using road transport :
Nearby Road Network.
Related developments by the Hong Kong government in West Kowloon, expect to improve the efficiency of road and pedestrian access routes, as well as to resolve a problematic traffic intersection in West Kowloon. These road developments hope to meet the transport needs of the entire area of the new development area of West Kowloon Cultural District and West Kowloon Terminus after completion.
Transportation Study identified the following specific road improvement measures:
Awards.
In 2010, the West Kowloon Terminus design won "Cityscape Awards for Architecture" in the Emerging Markets of Tourism, Travel & Transport Future Awards. In the same year on November 4, the West Kowloon Terminus design won the "Best Future Project ─ Infrastructure" World Architecture Festival Awards.

Marcus M. Key is a public health administrator and practitioner who served as the first director for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, signed by President Richard Nixon, gave new responsibilities to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), including the mandate to perform research on occupational safety and health problems, hazard evaluation, toxicity determinations, manpower development and training.
The Act established in the establishment of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and Marcus M. Key was appointed as the new Institute's first director. Previously Key had been the Assistant Surgeon General and director of the Bureau of Occupational Safety and Health. At NIOSH, Key oversaw 475 employees and worked with an initial budget of $17.8 million. 
In 1974, B.F. Goodrich Chemical Company contacted NIOSH concerning deaths and illnesses in its Louisville factory. After a coordinated investigation, Key issued recommendations for exposure limits to vinyl chloride. His published recommendation suggested that vinyl chloride used in the factory resulted in four fatalities from angiosarcoma of liver. By 1975, Dr. Key had resigned as director and was eventually replaced by John Finklea, who had overseen the Environmental Protection Agency's national laboratory in Durham, N.C.
Key began teaching at the University of Texas School of Public Health. In 1985, he was contacted by Labor Secretary William E. Brock about heading the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). After considering the post, Key opted to continue with his professorship.
In September 2013 Shell Oil Company partnered with the University of Texas School of Public Health to endow the Marcus M.

Harrison Gray Dyar

Harrison Gray Dyar (1805–1875) was an American chemist and inventor.
Early life.
Dyar grew up in Concord, Massachusetts. As a young man he initially made a living as an apprentice watchmaker, working for the Concord clockmaker Lemuel Curtis from 1818 to 1825. For many years he lived in Paris where he made a good living as a chemist. In 1858 he returned to America and settled in New York City. He married May 9, 1865.
Notability.
Alfred Munroe in "Concord and the Telegraph" records that Dyar and his brother Joseph were interested in the newly developed technology of electricity. They came up with the idea of transmitting a message over electrical wire. Dyar experimented and finally concluded that he had discovered how a message could be transmitted over a single wire. In 1826 he and his brother laid a wire line along the "Causeway", later called Lowell Road and the Red Bridge Road, that proved the technique viable. According to Colonel Whiting of Concord, the telegraph wire was strung from the trees along the Red Bridge Road over the Concord River at Hunt’s Bridge and went all the way to Curtis’s residence. Dyar used apothecary vial jars as glass insulators for the bare iron wire.
Dyar erected the first telegraph line and dispatched over it the first telegraph message ever sent in America — as determined by Levi Woodbury of the Supreme Court of the United States. Dyar had used over half a mile of bare electrical wire to transmit the message. He employed mechanical and electrical means that Samuel Morse used many years later for the telegraph system he patented in 1847. The author Munroe explains that Dyar made his telegraph line at least eighteen years before the actual materialization of the first practical Morse telegraph line that was made between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland.
According to Munroe it was Dyar, not Morse, who erected the first real telegraph line at the race track in Long Island in 1826 and dispatched the first message ever sent. This was years prior to the joint patent of electric telegraphy by William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone taken out in 1837 in England. Alfred Munroe writes in his book "Concord and the Telegraph", "This may seem strange to most of our readers. The credit of this great discovery has been generally conceded to Professor Morse, but the latter deserves credit only for combining and applying the discoveries of others." Dyar had erected his telegraph line some six years before Morse even began his investigation on telegraphy and some ten years before he began to talk about the subject. Because of threats with prosecution for "Conspiracy to send Secret Communications in advance of the Mail" Dyar abandoned his work.
Dyar’s telegraph technology.
Dyar recorded the sparks generated by the electrical current of his telegraph on a ribbon of moistened litmus paper on a spool that revolved mechanically by a clockwork apparatus. The nitric acid that was formed on the litmus paper by the action of the electricity left appropriate legible small red marks for designated letters. Dyar’s method was of frictional electrolytic nature where Morse’s was an electromagnetic usage.
Dyar’s early experiments using this method worked quite well. In fact his experiments proved his theory would work and impressed several investors. He was able to get an advanced loan in New-York to run a line at the Long Island race-course in 1827. Dyar then proposed to string a wire across New Jersey from New York to Philadelphia. However, the New Jersey legislature was skeptical on the issue because of security reasons. They even condemned Dyar as being dangerous because they thought he was some kind of a "wizard." They refused permission for this experiment of Dyar's because of fear of sending secret communications in advance of the mail.
There is an argument amongst historians that Morse got several of Dyar’s plans for the telegraph from him. Morse married the sister of one of Dyar’s associates named Charles Walker. Walker had worked with Dyar on the telegraph and had retained many of Dyar’s sketches. Historians speculate that either Charles Walker or his sister (Lucretia Pickering Walker) might well have shown those sketches to Morse. One idea supposedly "borrowed" was that Dyar used batteries and had the idea of sending electric impulses along a single wire. Dyar also had the idea of spacing the sparks in such a way as to form an alphabetic code and developed out this code years before Morse developed his Morse code.
Later life.
Dyar moved to Paris because of so much opposition to his telegraph technology. He was the father of Harrison Gray Dyar, Jr.

John Hatton

John Edward Hatton AO (born 29 May 1933) is former Australian politician, and an National Trust of Australia nominated Australian Living Treasure. He was the independent member of the Legislative Assembly of the New South Wales parliament for the seat of South Coast from 1973 to 1995. Notably, the allegations about police corruption Hatton raised in Parliament resulted in the Wood Royal Commission. He is currently a social activist in his local community.
Early life and background.
John Hatton was born in Hammondville, New South Wales, the son of Harry and Florence Hatton. He was educated at Hammondville Public School, Hurlstone Agricultural High School and Armidale Teachers' College.
Hatton was the President of the NSW Shire of Shoalhaven before his entry into state politics. Hatton was the Foundation President and President for 15 years of the Shoalhaven Combined Progress Associations.
State parliamentary career.
Hatton was the member for the New South Wales lower house seat of South Coast between 1973 and 1995. A measure of Hatton's local popularity occurred in the 1976 state election where he polled in excess of 77% of the first preference formal votes. Shortly after becoming elected Hatton donated a parliamentary pay rise to charity because it hadn't been granted by an independent body. John Hatton was elected as an independent for this seat for 22 years through the Askin, Lewis, Willis, Wran, Unsworth, Greiner and Fahey governments to 1995. He used parliamentary privilege to expose organised crime in the Griffith mafia, police corruption and malfeasance within government departments and agencies. In 1994, by 46 votes to 45, he forced the minority Fahey Government to establish the Wood Royal Commission into Police Corruption. This ground-breaking royal commission overcome objections from the Independent Commission Against Corruption, led to widespread reform of the NSW Police Force and the establishment of the Police Integrity Commission.
Later life.
Hatton continues to advocate for his local community. In 2009 he called for a Royal Commission into property and planning corruption in NSW.
Return to politics.
1 September 2010, John Hatton announced his intent to stand with a team of 21 independents for the New South Wales Legislative Council House at the NSW State Election on Saturday 26 March 2011. His running mate is small business owner and Community Independent Ian Scandrett who is #2 on the ticket. The grouping of candidates will be known as the John Hatton Independents Team. Hatton and his fellow candidates of his team were unsuccessful at the 2011 election.

It connects the Market–Frankford Line at the Frankford Transportation Center to either Morrell Park, Torresdale, or Holmesburg, primarily along Frankford Avenue, which includes (US 13) and the historic, pre-colonial Frankford Avenue Bridge.
The route is operated by trolleybuses, also called trackless trolleys (especially locally), which replaced streetcars (trolley cars) on the route on September 11, 1955. (The last day of streetcar operation was July 30, 1955, with diesel buses then used temporarily for six weeks.)
Diesel buses temporarily replaced trackless trolleys on route 66 in June 2002, because of reconstruction of Frankford Depot (garage) and the adjacent Market-Frankford "El" viaduct and station, but trackless service was restored in April 2008. All of the vehicles currently in use are ADA-compliant and equipped with bicycle racks. "Night Owl" service is also available, and rush hour service includes both local and express trips.

Frano Botica

Frano Michael Botica (born 3 August 1963) is a former rugby union and rugby league player. Born in Mangakino, New Zealand, he represented New Zealand at both codes, and also played for Croatia in a rugby union World Cup qualifying match.
Rugby union.
Botica played domestic club rugby union for North Harbour and Llanelli and spent a period in France. Botica also played rugby league for Wigan Warriors and Castleford Tigers.
Botica appeared for New Zealand Māori (between 1985 and 1989), New Zealand Emerging Players (1985), North Island in the 1986 inter-island match, the national sevens side in eight international tournaments between 1985 and 1988 and for the Anzac XV that played the British Lions in Australia in 1989. He even appeared in the Super 12: once for the Chiefs in 1998.
In the early part of his Rugby Union career he was a rival to Grant Fox for the All Blacks number 10 jersey. Botica was regarded as more a running player whereas Fox was considered a superior kicker and it was his rival who eventually won the selectors' favour, forcing Botica to the bench and restricting the number of Union tests he played.
He was a part of the first ever New Zealand sevens team to win a Hong Kong Sevens title.
He is ranked 5th in the top 5 North Harbour legends.
Rugby league.
Botica joined the Wigan rugby league club in British league in 1990 in what was an exodus of All Black backs to rugby league including Matthew Ridge (Manly-Warringah), John Gallagher (Leeds) and John Schuster Newcastle). While at Wigan he became a prolific points scorer and the fastest man in the history of British league to reach 1,000 points.
In 1991 he played for the New Zealand Māori side in his first match of rugby league in New Zealand.
During the 1991–92 Rugby Football League season, he played for defending champions Wigan on the wing in their 21-4 victory against the visiting Australian champions Penrith in the 1991 World Club Challenge played in front of 20,152 fans at the Anfield ground in Liverpool.
Botica played in seven internationals for New Zealand between 1991 and 1993, including an upset win over Australia in Melbourne during the first test of the 1991 Trans-Tasman Test series. Botica played at for the Kiwis in all three tests of the series, won 2-1 by Australia. His selection saw him flown in from England for the series in preference to an in-form Matthew Ridge who was based in Sydney. He won praise from Australian coach Bob Fulton who proclaimed that he could play as well as any fullback then playing in the Winfield Cup competition.
During the 1992–93 Rugby Football League season, Botica played at for defending RFL champions Wigan in the 1992 World Club Challenge against the visiting 1992 Winfield Cup premiers, the Brisbane Broncos. Brisbane became the first Australian side to win the World Club Challenge in England when they defeated Wigan 22-8 in front of 17,764 fans at Wigan's Central Park.
After the 1993–94 Rugby Football League season, Botica travelled with defending champions Wigan to Brisbane, playing at five-eighth in the 1994 World Club Challenge. Again playing the Broncos, this time at the ANZ Stadium in Brisbane, Wigan reversed the 1992 result with a 20-14 win in front of a WCC record attendance of 54,220 fans, including a number of Wigan supporters who had traveled to Australia to watch the game. A deadly accurate goal kicker, Botica kicked four goals on the night, all without a miss.
Botica set a new record for most goals in a season for Wigan when he kicked 186 during the 1994–95 Rugby Football League season. He also played for the Auckland Warriors during their inaugural year in 1995, before returning to England to play for the Castleford Tigers in 1996.
Despite eventually becoming a five-eighth in rugby league, Botica spent much of his time in the 13-aside code, including all of his seven tests for New Zealand, either at fullback or on the wing and fullback
Return to Union.
When rugby union became openly professional, Botica returned to the 15-a-side code to play for Llanelli in Wales and then in France. And in the late 1990s he even played for Croatia in a World Cup qualifying match. In his late 30s he returned for the North Harbour Rugby Union in New Zealand and played several matches, mainly off the bench.
Later years.
In 2009 Botica worked with the New Zealand Warriors as a kicking coach. Botica's son Ben is a former member of North Harbour's ITM Cup squad, has represented New Zealand Schoolboys, and currently plays for Aviva Premiership side Harlequin F.C.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry

The Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry was developed by the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA. The Registry contains detailed information on over 3,300 cost-utility analyses published through 2012. Health-related CEAs estimate the resources used (costs) and the health benefits achieved (effects) for an intervention compared to an alternative treatment strategy. The Registry focuses on a subset of CEAs, called cost-utility analyses (CUAs) that quantify health benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), a metric that accounts for changes in both longevity and quality of life.
General information.
The project website states that the objectives of the Registry are to help decision makers identify society's best opportunities for targeting resources to improve health, to assist policymakers in healthcare resource allocation decisions, and to move the field towards the use of standard methodologies.
The CEA Registry contains data on articles published from 1976 through 2012, including information on more than 8,900 ratios. The Registry website lists 30 academic papers based on the Registry data. It has been used or cited in analyses performed by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, the Institute of Medicine, and the Medicare Payment Assessment Commission. The CEA Registry is also listed on the National Library of Medicine's website as a health economics resource.
The published articles summarized in the Registry undergo a formalized review protocol. These articles address a variety of diseases and treatments and all measure health effects in terms of the QALYs, a standard measure that accounts for quality of life (morbidity) and longevity (mortality). The CEA Registry team searches MEDLINE for English-language articles using keywords "QALYs", "quality-adjusted", and "cost-utility analysis". Abstracts from these articles are screened to determine if the paper contains an original cost-utility estimate. The team excludes review, editorial, or methodological articles, as well as cost-effectiveness analyses that do not use QALYs to quantify health benefits.
Each article meeting these criteria is assigned a disease classification by a clinician. Two readers with training in decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis independently review each article and record information using a standardized set of forms and instructions. The two readers convene for a consensus audit to resolve any potential discrepancies. On occasion, a third reader may be called upon to help settle disputed items.
Data on over 40 variables is collected for each article.
Article Information.

For methodology, the registry reports
Ratio Information.
The registry describes the health intervention that is the subject of the analysis, and comparator intervention to which it is compared, and the population that is eligible for the intervention. When available, the costs and health benefits (QALYs) associated with both the target and comparator interventions are reported. The registry reports the value of the ratio reported in the original article, as well as the value calculated directly from the cost and health benefit information in the article. The registry also reports the ratio quadrant.
Utility Weight Information.
The registry reports the health condition, utility weight value, and range of plausible values. When used, the registry reports secondary literature sources relied upon to provide utility weight values. In cases where the authors develop their own utility weight values, the registry describes the methodology used.

Golden Bears.
From the mid-1930s up until 1961, Kutztown's sports teams were known as the Golden Avalanche. In 1961, Kutztown replaced the Golden Avalanche nickname with the Golden Bears as the University's nickname. In later years, Golden Bear mascots came into play. Before 2005, Goldie and Griz served as the KU Golden Bear mascots. However, they were both "graduated" to make way for a new mascot. The Raymond Entertainment Group of Newark, Delaware, helped KU create the new mascot. On October 1, 2005, at Kutztown's football game versus West Chester University, Kutztown University unveiled Avalanche as the school's new mascot. Avalanche is so named to honor Kutztown State College during the time of the Golden Avalanche sports teams.
The Golden Bears can be seen in more places than the sports fields. Golden Bear statues are located near the basketball courts on South Campus and in North Campus near the Boehm Science Building. Along with the statues, several residential areas are named after the Golden Bear. Golden Bear Village South behind University Place and Golden Bear Village West next to Rothermel Hall are student apartments which hold the Golden Bear moniker.

Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger vs. Super Sentai

Plot.
When the Gaorangers engage in another battle with the Org Dukes Yabaiba and Tsue-Tsue, the two manage to summon the Lost Highness Rakushaasa, an Org Duke who can siphon the fighting spirit out of his opponents. Rakushaasa lends his power to Yabaiba and Tsue-Tsue, enabling them to defeat the Gaorangers. He then attacks and drains Gao Yellow (Gaku Washio), Gao Blue (Kai Samezu) and Gao Black (Sotaro Ushigome) of their battle spirits, leaving them in a state of near panic. Gao Red (Kakeru Shishi) quickly orders Gao White (Sae Taiga) to escort the other Gaorangers to safety as he continues to battle Rakushaasa alone.
Rakushaasa subjects Gao Red to several illusion-based battles with previously vanquished Org Dukes, attempting to drive him to despair. Meanwhile, the shaken Gaorangers are suddenly confronted by a wandering monk, who tells them of the existence of Super Sentai, teams of multi-colored warriors of whom the Gaorangers are the latest version. Each of the Gaorangers' G-Phones then scurries off, causing the Gaorangers to chase them.
The scurrying G-Phones lead each Gaoranger to a member of a previous Super Sentai team. Gaku is led to Yuusuke Amamiya, Red Falcon of "Choujuu Sentai Liveman", who gives him a training lesson in swordsmanship and explains the Super Sentai's expertise with weaponry. Kai encounters Daimon Tatsumi, Go Yellow of "Kyuukyuu Sentai GoGoFive," who explains how each Sentai team develops fighting techniques. Sotaro is led to Gouki, Ginga Blue of "Seijuu Sentai Gingaman," who teaches Gao Black about the Sentai use of physical strength. Sai meets Miku Imamura, Mega Pink of "Denji Sentai Megaranger," who explains the strengths and abilities of female Super Sentai members.
The two women are then surprised by Yabaiba and Tsue-Tsue, but the two Org Dukes are then challenged by the wandering monk, who reveals himself to be Banba Soukichi, Big One of "J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai". Banba and Miku help Sai rescue an exhausted Kakeru from Rakushaasa's clutches, and the heroes are quickly joined by the rejuvenated Gaorangers and their Super Sentai teachers.
As the former Super Sentai (led by Banba) engage and destroy Rakushaasa's hastily summoned force of Org Dukes, the Gaorangers battle and defeat Yabaiba, Tsue-Tsue and Rakushaasa. Rakushaasa then summons more power, growing to giant size and attacking the city. He easily defeats the Gaorangers' Gao Muscle, but is driven back by an onslaught unleashed from an array of transforming mecha and special vehicles from Super Sentai history. The Gaorangers then summon Gao King, which is then imbued with energy from past Super Sentai combined mecha forms. Gao King then unleashes a powerful blast that annihilates Rakushaasa's giant form.
But Rakushaasa is not destroyed; he rejuvenates himself by draining power from a fleeing Yabaiba and Tsue-Tsue and attacks the Super Sentai. The former Sentai explain that the Gaorangers need to summon "Super Sentai Tamashii," the pure fighting spirit that imbues all of the teams. To help inspire them, Red Falcon summons 23 other Red Warriors from all the previous Super Sentai teams, from Akarenger of "Himitsu Sentai Gorenger" to Time Red of "Mirai Sentai Timeranger". Their presence inspires the Gaorangers to summon "Super Sentai Damashi" from within themselves, which Kakeru uses to finally disintegrate Rakushaasa.
With Rakushaasa's defeat, all the former Super Sentai vanish. Returning to their home base, the Gaorangers find their mentor Tetomu in a faint; she vaguely remembers seeing Rakushaasa's appearing but quickly dismisses it as a bad dream. It's left to "Gaoranger's" narrator to assure the team (and the viewer) that the adventure was real.

<doc id="20082845" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20082845" title="Qualifying Industrial Zone">
Qualifying Industrial Zone

Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) are industrial parks that house manufacturing operations in Jordan and Egypt. They are a special free trade zones established in collaboration with neighboring Israel to take advantage of the free trade agreements between the United States and Israel. Under the trade agreements with Jordan as laid down by the United States, goods produced in QIZ-notified areas can directly access US markets without tariff or quota restrictions, subject to certain conditions. To qualify, goods produced in these zones must contain a small portion of Israeli input. In addition, a minimum 35% value to the goods must be added to the finished product.
The brainchild of Jordanian businessman Omar Salah, the first QIZ was authorized by the United States Congress in 1997. The Al-Hassan Industrial Estate in Irbid in northern Jordan was designated as the world's first QIZ under the agreement. Since 1998, several other QIZ locations have been set up in Jordan, and later in Egypt. The idea behind the establishment of QIZs was to foster a sense of prosperity and stability in Middle East through economic cooperation and employment.
Qualifying Industrial Zones differ from other trade zones as they are stand-alone entities within one country and not directly connected to other countries. In addition, QIZ products are for exports and domestic consumption in any country, not limited to specific countries, and most importantly operate only under the authority and conditions laid down by the host government.
, there are five Qualifying Industrial Zones in Jordan and four QIZ designated regions in Egypt.
History.
The concept behind a Qualifying Industrial Zone is credited to be the brainchild of Omar Salah, a Jordanian businessman. In 1993, in anticipation of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Salah traveled to Israel with the intention of doing business with Israeli businessmen. He was also interested in business ventures that could take advantage of the eight-year old free trade agreement between the United States and Israel that allowed Israeli goods to enter the US markets duty-free. After the treaty was signed in 1994, a business venture was struck between Salah and Delta Galil, where labor was transferred to Irbid in northern Jordan, to take advantage of low labor costs that were forty to seventy percent lower than in Israel. Salah had envisioned that by exploiting Israeli resources such as labor, finances, and contacts, and then leveraging it to produce value-added goods, the economy of Jordan would be benefited. In addition, he surmised that economic cooperation between the two nations would help foster peace in the region.
Additional business ventures followed and Salah then set up a public share-holding company Century Investments. For doing business with Israel, many Jordanian organizations criticized Salah and boycotted the purchase of output in Jordan. Despite the heavy criticism, Salah nevertheless received tacit support from King Abdullah of Jordan. To combat the boycott, Salah began to work with multinationals with a larger international stake. He then actively lobbied the Jordanian government to set negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States on the lines of the "United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985". Faced with little enthusiasm by the Jordanian government, Salah scrutinized the Presidential Proclamation (No. 6955) that was part of the Palestinian agreement signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel in 1993. In the agreement, the areas on the border between Israel and Jordan were designated as "Qualifying Industrial Zones", and goods produced here would not have tariff and quota restrictions to the US markets. Since the Hassan industrial estate in Irbid, where Salah had factories located, was situated far from the bordering areas, it did not qualify for QIZ status.
Salah then lobbied the Jordanian government for extending these regions into other parts of Jordan. Government officials were luke-warm to the idea and told him that it would be "naive to assume" that the United States would give Jordan this status. Unfazed by this response, Salah traveled to the United States and lobbied hard with the US State Department, the White House, and the US Trade Representative that it was in US interests to extend the QIZ into Jordan's interiors. Lawyers in the United States then told Salah that even if a small portion of Israeli territory was associated with a QIZ, the proposal might materialize. Soon, USTR officials began to travel to Jordan to work on the deal.
Finally, in 1997, an agreement was signed at the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) conference at Doha that established a QIZ agreement with Jordan. On 6 March 1998, the Al-Hassan Zone in Irbid was designated the first QIZ in Jordan.
After the setting up of the first QIZ, few Jordanian companies took advantage of QIZ benefits due to the general hostility in doing business with Israel. Instead, Chinese and Indian companies quickly took advantage of the vacuum to set up business establishments. The lack of local enthusiasm was criticized by the "Jordan Times" for missing the "golden opportunity". Gradually though, more Jordanian businesses began to set up business establishments as political hostilities began to be overshadowed by business economics. Soon after 1998, an additional twelve sites were given QIZ status by USTR.
Positive results from the Jordanian QIZ led to the Government of Egypt negotiating a separate QIZ protocol with the United States in Cairo on 24 December 2004. The protocol came into effect in February 2005.
Regulations.
Under the agreement (P.L. 104–234) requires that articles eligible for QIZ status must be manufactured in or directly imported from the areas administered by the Palestine Authority or another notified QIZ and meet the several conditions.
To quality for this scheme a product must be substantially transformed in the manufacturing process. Material and processing costs incurred in a QIZ must total not less than 35% of the appraised value of the product when imported into the United States. Of this 35%, 15% must be either US materials or materials from Israel, the West Bank, or the Gaza Strip, and/or Jordan or Egypt depending on the program. The remaining 20% of the 35% input must come from Israel and Jordan or Egypt. The remaining 65% can come from any part of the world. All importers must also certify that the article meet conditions for duty exemption.
Under the sharing agreements, the manufacturer from the Jordanian side must contribute at least 11.7% of the final produce, and the manufacturer on the Israeli side must contribute 8% (7% on high-tech products). Under the Israeli-Egyptian agreement, 11.7% of the inputs must be made in Israel.
The clothing and textile industry has benefited most from this arrangement. As tariffs on these goods into the United States are relatively high, exporters have used the duty-free benefits of QIZs to gain quick access to markets in the United States.
Jordan.
On 6 March 1998, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) designated the Al-Hassan Industrial Estate in the northern city of Irbid as the first QIZ. Since then, an addition twelve QIZs have been also designated across the country. Prominent QIZs include the Al-Hussein Ibn Abdullah II Industrial Estate at Al Karak, owned and operated by the Jordan Industrial Estate Corporation, the Jordan Cyber City in Irbid, the privately owned Al-Tajamouat Industrial Estate at Amman, Ad-Dulayl Industrial Park and El-Zai Ready-wear Manufacturing Company near Zarqa. Upcoming industrial parks include the Gateway QIZ on the northern border with Israel, Aqaba Industrial Estate at Aqaba, and the Mushatta International complex in Amman.
Jordan has seen a substantial economic growth since the QIZ were set up. Exports from Jordan to the United States grew from 15 million USD to over 1 billion USD in 2004. Government sources have estimated that over 40,000 jobs have been created with the set up of QIZs. Investment is currently valued at USD 85–100 million and expected to grow to $180 to $200 million. The success of QIZ have led to the United States and Jordan signing a Free Trade Agreement in 2001 that was approved by the US Congress.
Between 1998 and 2005 Jordan moved up from the United States' thirteenth to eight largest trading partner among the 20 Middle-East-North African (MENA) entities. In 2005, US exports to and imports from Jordan totalled an estimated $1.9 billion: U.S. exports, at an estimated $646 million, were 1.8 times their 1998 level; US imports, at $1.3 billion, were 80 times their 1998 level. Despite the 2001 FTA between the United States and Jordan, 75% of Jordanian
articles enter the United States through the QIZ program.
The apparel industry dominates both Jordan's QIZs and total exports to the United States, accounting for 99.9% of all QIZ exports and 86% of all Jordanian exports to the United States. The reason for this dominance is that QIZ products enter the United States free of duty, whereas, under the US–Jordan FTA, tariffs will not be fully eliminated until the end of the ten-year phase-in period, in 2011.
Egypt.
After the WTO phased out quantitative quotas on textile in 2004 under the Agreement on Textile and Closing, ATC, Egyptian textile and garment producers feared that their industry would be threatened by global competition from China and India. The flood of similar articles from these two nations to the United States could edge out Egyptian exports, and possibly result in the loss of 150,000 job opportunities. This was estimated to cost some of the $3.2 billion in US foreign direct investment in Egypt. Further, Egypt was in search of sources for increased economic growth and trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force.
Positive results from the Jordanian led to the Government of Egypt negotiating a QIZ protocol in Cairo on 24 December 2004 that came into effect in February 2005. USTR has designated three QIZs in Egypt – the Greater Cairo Zone, the Alexandria Zone, and the Suez Canal Zone (69 CFR 78094). On 4 November 2005, the USTR designated a fourth zone in the Central Delta region and expanded the Greater Cairo and Suez Canal zones.
The protocol signed between the two nations is a non-reciprocal arrangement and is expected to be a step towards the establishment of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two countries. However negotiations toward a US–Egyptian free trade agreement have recently been suspended over human rights issues.
The results have been positive. Israeli exports to Egypt rose over 30% from USD 29 million in 2004 to USD 93.2 million and exceeded USD 125 million in 2006. ten QIZs have been set up in Egypt. Some estimate that approximately 20% of companies based in QIZs are wholly owned by
Jordanians.
Social impact.
Although most experts note that companies based in QIZs hire foreign laborers, thousands of Jordanians, particularly women from the rural countryside, have found jobs at garment factories in QIZs. In a traditional society such as Jordan, many of these women had little previous work experience and were largely caretakers of their home. Despite the low wages paid by apparel factories in the QIZs, some women have been able to support their families. However, traditional attitudes toward a woman’s place in the home persist, and many families continue to prohibit female members from working in QIZs. (See Women in Jordan) In response, the Jordanian Ministry of Labor has worked to ease the adjustment of women moving from the home to a new job by providing free transportation to work, subsidizing the cost of food in QIZs, and paying for dormitories near factories to cut commuting times.
The long-term effect of female employment in QIZs are yet to be quantified, and there is some concern that over time, Jordanian women may have difficulty in achieving higher wages in a global economy where apparel manufacturers can easily relocate to cheaper labor markets.
When the QIZ program came into being in 1996, observers regarded it as a vehicle to support the development of peaceful relations and normalization of commercial ties between Israel and the two Arab states (Jordan and Egypt) with which it had signed peace treaties. In both cases, however, a tenuous peace continues to prevail between Israel and the two Arab states. Since the conclusion of the Jordan–Israel peace treaty in October 1994, large numbers of Jordanians, particularly fundamentalists, those of Palestinian origin, and members of the professional unions continue to oppose normalization with Israel and resist the expansion of commercial relations. With the establishment of 13 QIZs in Jordan, there has been an increase in the volume of bilateral trade, though the overall totals remain modest.
Criticisms.
By far the biggest international criticism of QIZs in Jordan is the humanitarian crisis within the factories. A comprehensive report by the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights found that Sri Lankan migrant workers were subject to "routine sexual abuse and rape." 
The United States Trade Representative (USTR) designation of 13 factories throughout Jordan (under the US-Jordan Free Trade Agreement) has led to disastrous realities, gender inequality and gender based violence:

Mascoma Corporation

Mascoma Corporation is a U.S. biofuel company that produces cellulosic ethanol made from wood and switchgrass. Headquartered in Lebanon, New Hampshire, the company was founded in 2005 by Robert Johnsen (CEO), Lee Lynd and Charles Wyman, two professors from Dartmouth College. The company's founders have continued to work with Dartmouth’s Thayer School of Engineering on its research into ethanol engineering. The company is named after Mascoma Lake, which is near Lebanon.
Start-up.
The company was first financed by Flagship Ventures and Khosla Ventures in 2006. Also in 2006, the company raised attracted additional attention with two private financing rounds led by General Catalyst Partners that raised $34 million and through its acquisition of Celsys BioFuels Inc. of Indianapolis. Also in 2007, it received a US$14.8 million grant from two government agencies—the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority—for the creation of a plant in Rochester, New York, that would demonstrate the biomass-to-ethanol process.
Partnerships.
In September 2007, Mascoma announced plans to partner with the University of Tennessee to build the first U.S. plant for the commercial production of switchgrass-based ethanol. In June 2008, however, the projected plant failed to meet its anticipated funding levels, and Mascoma withdrew from the partnership. Instead, it took on the role as technical adviser.
In May 2008, the company entered a partnership with General Motors to develop cellulosic ethanol based on Mascoma’s formula that enables the biochemical conversion of nongrain biomass into low-carbon biofuel. In the same month, Mascoma received a $10 million investment from the Houston-based oil and gas company Marathon Oil.
In October 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy gave the company a $26 million grant to develop a cellulosic fuel production facility. In the same month, the state government of Michigan gave the company a $23.5 million grant to bring that proposed facility to Chippewa County, Michigan.
Facilities.
On April 14, 2009, Mascoma Corp. announced plans to move its corporate headquarters from Boston to a new research laboratory in New Hampshire. The move would consolidate most of Mascoma's operations, which, until now, have been divided among Boston; a demonstration facility in Rome, New York; a Process and Development laboratory in Woburn, Massachusetts; and a lab in Lebanon, New Hampshire, where many of the company's employees already are based. Researchers in Lebanon are working to convert plant material such as wood chips and corn stover into biofuel.
Technological breakthrough.
On May 7, 2009, the company announced a major technological breakthrough in the field of consolidated bioprocessing by utilizing a low-cost strategy for processing of biofuels from cellulosic biomass, which enables high yield of ethanol and cellulaze in single step without the costly, separate usage of the cellulaze enzyme.
Other biofuel companies (such as Gate Fuels Qteros) also claim to have developed a one-step process to produce ethanol or value-added chemicals from plant material.
As of March 2013, the company web site says: "We plan to initially target the large and established first generation corn ethanol industry with our proprietary Mascoma Grain Technology, or MGT, yeast product. We are also working with leading industry participants to develop and construct commercial scale facilities to convert hardwood feedstocks into cellulosic ethanol."

Milton, Nottinghamshire

Milton, Nottinghamshire is a village/hamlet in Nottinghamshire. It is part of East Markham civil parish, a short distance northwest of East Markham and southwest of Sibthorpe.
Mausoleum.
The mausoleum at Milton was designed by Robert Smirke and built in 1831-2. It was intended as a tomb for the Duchess of Newcastle who died in 1822. In 1896, Cornelius Brown wrote of the mausoleum:
Here is the vault of the noble family of Clinton; and herein the two last Dukes of Newcastle were interred. The church contains a monument to the fourth Duke, and opposite to it is a beautiful piece of statuary to the memory of his Duchess, by Westmacott. The inscription states that her Grace "gave birth to fourteen children, ten of whom lived to deplore the bereavement of an incomparable mother. Of the others, Anne Maria preceded her by a few months, and it is humbly hoped led the way to regions of eternal bliss. Two infants were carried by their parent to the grave."
Parishioners of East Markham often preferred to worhsip here, rather than the old church at East Markham, until it fell into disrepair.
"This church is cared for by The Churches Conservation Trust. Although no longer needed for regular worship, it remains a consecrated building, a part of England's history, maintained for the benefit of this and future generations."

Baltinglass GAA

Baltinglass GAA Club is a Gaelic Athletic Association club based in Wicklow, Ireland. The main sport is gaelic football. The club participates in male and female competitions from under 8 through to Adult ages run by the Wicklow GAA county board. The clubs motto is Belief, Attitude, Loyalty, Trust, & Optimism, or BALTO for short
A Brief History.
Football has been played in Baltinglass since the foundation of the Gaelic Athletic Association. In the early years the club played under the name of Maurice Davins but achieved little in the way of success on the field of play, and from time to time disappeared from Wicklow inter-club activity. The first real success for the club came in 1913, when playing under the banner of Baltinglass Shamrocks, they won the delayed 1912 Wicklow Junior title—the final of which was played in Croke Park. Lean years followed the winning of the Junior title; the next championship to come to the town was in 1927 when the Wicklow Senior Hurling title was won. Football had fallen away in the town in the early thirties but in 1934 a meeting was held to re-establish the club and out of this the seeds of the present club were planted.
The club won a minor title in 1940 followed by a Junior title in 1943 and with this it was promoted to Intermediate ranks. The Juvenile section of the club won four-in-a-row minor from 1952 to 1955. Around this time the club embarked on a fund raising drive with the aim of buying their own pitch. This came to fruition in 1957 when the present playing pitch was bought.
When the Intermediate grade was abolished in 1954 the Wicklow County board decided to promote Baltinglass to the Senior grade. Two years later the club reached its first Senior final.
1958 saw Baltinglass win the Wicklow Senior title for the first time and over the next four decades the Miley cup was to become a regular visitor to the town. Four titles in the sixties - including a 3 in a row, four titles in the seventies, six in the eighties and five in the nineties. This included an eight in a row from 1987 to 1994. A Leinster club title was finally secured in 1989 and on March 17, 1990 this would lead to the Andy Merigan cup and with it the title of All-Ireland club champions.
The club has won every football honour available in Wicklow including the Intermediate title in 1993. 
The club has two training pitches to go along with the main playing pitch, dressing rooms, weight rooms and a committee room. The ground is undergoing a major redevelopment, which has seen floodlights installed, a stand being built and other improvements carried out. The club fields three adult men's teams, one Senior and two Junior as well as two ladies adult teams at Senior and Junior.
Pitch Location.
The playing pitch along with the two training pitches, dressing rooms, weight room committee room and kitchen are located approximately 3 km east of the town of Baltinglass on the Kiltegan Road, the R747.
Other items of note.
The Baltinglass GAA playing pitch is the second pitch of Wicklow GAA, and as such stands in for the County Grounds O'Byrne Park in Aughrim should the Aughrim pitch be unavailable.
Baltinglass GAA Club organise coaching sessions within schools in the area including Scoil Naomh Iósaf and Scoil Chonglais.
Club Lotto.
The Baltinglass GAA Club Fundraising Lotto draws form part of the Clubs fundraising efforts.

Oporto British School

Oporto British School, in Foz do Douro, Porto, is the oldest British school in mainland Europe, established in 1894.
The current Head Master is Mr Michael William Clack. Other members of the Senior Leadership Team include: Head of Primary Section, Mr Mark Evans, Head of Secondary Section, Mrs Paula Rodrigues, Deputy Head (IB Coordinator), Mr Jeremy Mutter and the Bursar Mrs Angela Henriques.
It is a private, day school for both boys and girls, aged 3 to 18 with approximately 425 pupils on roll. It follows a British-style curriculum until the completion of the IGCSE.
Senior pupils then study the IB Diploma Programme and many go on to Higher Education in the UK, Portugal and to many other international locations.
It received CIS Accreditation in 2005. It is a member of the European Council of International Schools, the Council of British International Schools and the current Head Master is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.
Houses.
As with many independent schools, Oporto British School is divided in houses. These are:
History.
The Oporto British School opened on the first day of the Summer Term in 1894 with 11 boys, with the Rev WS Picken MA as the Master. The School house, located in the Porto suburb, Foz do Douro, was rented at the time but was eventually purchased in 1922 and remains part of the school’s facilities today. Non-British boys were accepted for the first time in 1902, and girls in 1914. Pupil numbers remained small, and it was not until well after the Second World War that the roll exceeded 100.
The school, originally founded as a Prep School, continued as such until the mid-1950s, when some pupils remained to take their GCE examinations. The early 1960s saw a further development in provision for Portuguese pupils, as the school ensured that, in addition to following an English curriculum, a parallel course in Portuguese was also followed.
Growing pupil numbers through the 1970s and into the 1980s meant that a significant building programme was required in order to provide the accommodation and facilities for in excess of 200 pupils. A curriculum for post-IGCSE pupils was developed in the early 1990s with the provision of courses leading to the award of the International Baccalaureate Diploma. By this time, the proportion of pupils from a Portuguese background exceeded that of all others, including British students. This trend has continued so that today there are in excess of 400 pupils in the school, 80% of whom are from Portuguese families, 10% are British and 10% from other backgrounds.
Along with recent growth in pupils numbers has been significant curriculum and campus development. These, together with the high education received by the pupils as evidenced by IB results, have led the school to achieve fully accredited status by the Council of International Schools.
Leadership and management.
The school is run by an elected board of governors (Chairman of the Board, Dr Philip Brebner) and the Senior Leadership Team include: Head of Primary Section, Mr Mark Evans, Head of Secondary Section, Mrs Paula Rodrigues, Deputy Head (IB Coordinator), Mr Jeremy Mutter and the Bursar Mrs Angela Henriques. There are also two elected members of staff representing staff members at all board meetings.
The School has a Head Boy (Rishi Lakhani) and Head Girl (Rita Vaz Sousa) who represent the pupil body at public and ceremonial events.
The school has a Parent-Teacher Association (The President of the Parents Association is the Head Master and the current Chair of the PTA is Mrs Elisabeth Martorell.
Location.
The school is situated in the suburb of Foz do Douro. It is a few minutes walk to both the Atlantic Ocean and the mouth of the River Douro. Greater Porto is an urban conurbation with a population of some 1.6m. 
Sports, initiatives and extra-curricular activities.
Oporto British School has a range of sports. Traditionally, the main school sports have been Football and Basketball. The school's sport colours are blue and white. The school participates in school competitions annually and term-by-term.
The school received Green Flag status on 29 September 2009, for environmentally friendly practice.
The school participates in many national and international trips annually of sporting, charitable and cultural significance. These include:

Adult contemporary music

Adult contemporary music (AC) is a broad style of popular music, ranging from 1950s and 1960s vocal music to ballads with a varying degree of rock influence. The term is also used to describe a radio format which plays such music.
Adult-contemporary radio plays music other than hip hop, heavy metal, hard rock, teen pop music and rhythm-heavy dance tracks, genres less popular among the target demographic of these radio stations. Radio stations playing this format generally targets the 18–54 age group, the demographic which has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s.
Adult contemporary music has spawned a number of sub-formats: hot AC, soft (or "lite") AC, modern AC, urban adult contemporary, rhythmic adult contemporary, smooth jazz and Christian AC (softer contemporary Christian music). Some radio stations play hot AC, others play only soft AC and others play a variety of sub-genres. It is not considered a specific musical genre, since it includes music from a number of genres.
History.
Many radio stations played top-40 hits, regardless of genre, until the mid-1970s (when they began to target particular demographic groups). Specialized radio stations then played specific musical genres.
When rock and roll became popular during the mid-1950s, conservative radio stations wanted to play non-rock hits; these stations included adult standards and big band titles to appeal to listeners who had grown up with those songs. This format was known as middle-of-the-road (MOR), played on WJR in Detroit, WGN and WBBM in Chicago, KGO in San Francisco, WNEW in New York, and WCCO in Minneapolis. Billboard magazine first published an adult-contemporary music chart in 1961, although it did not use the name "Adult Contemporary" until 1979.
While most popular MOR stations at the time were on AM, beautiful-music and classical stations began to move to FM because of its superior audio quality. Although most easy-listening music was instrumental, adult contemporary music attempt to create a similar ("lite") format with compatible tracks by popular artists.
Early examples of the adult-contemporary format included WHAS in Louisville, Kentucky and KDKA in Pittsburgh, former MOR stations which began playing fewer standards and more contemporary, non-hard-rock music. During the mid-1970s WHAS called its format "Good and Gold", including rock-and-roll oldies on its playlist and playing harder-rock songs on weekends. "Mellow rock" stations (such as WMGK in Philadelphia, WBBM-FM in Chicago, KNX-FM in Los Angeles and WCCO-FM in Minneapolis) emerged on FM, mixing adult-contemporary hits with album tracks by singer-songwriters such as James Taylor, Carly Simon, Carole King, Janis Ian, Paul Simon and Elton John.
VH1 began as an adult-contemporary version of MTV, appealing to viewers in their 30s and 40s. During the mid-1990s, it began playing videos by Hootie & The Blowfish, the Gin Blossoms, Alanis Morissette, Melissa Etheridge, the Spin Doctors, Amy Grant and Ace of Base.
Adult contemporary music has evolved; artists such as Barbra Streisand, the Carpenters, Barry Manilow, the Captain & Tennille and Olivia Newton-John were less popular, and MTV artists such as Madonna, Culture Club, Cyndi Lauper, Tears for Fears and Whitney Houston began appearing on the adult-contemporary charts. VH1 has moved away from its adult-contemporary format with Destiny's Child, Eminem, Jay-Z and Snoop Dogg. Since the mid 2000s, bands such as Wilco and Feist have pushed indie rock into the adult-contemporary format.
Sub-formats.
Hot AC.
Hot adult contemporary (or "hot AC") is a format in which radio stations play a variety of music from about the previous 30 years; classic hits predominate over newer songs, and the playlist varies by station. Modern adult contemporary, a variety of hot AC, includes modern rock music. In 1997, Mike Marino of KMXB in Las Vegas described the format as reaching "an audience that has outgrown the edgier hip-hop or alternative music but hasn't gotten old and sappy enough for the soft ACs." The target audience was 25 to 39, and the format's artists included The Cranberries, Better Than Ezra, Alanis Morissette, Seal, The Wallflowers, Hootie & the Blowfish, Modern English, Counting Crows, No Doubt, Gin Blossoms, Blues Traveler, Sarah McLachlan, Jewel and Sheryl Crow. Unlike modern rock, with an 18–34 male target audience, modern adult contemporary appealed to women. Early modern AC stations were KTNP in Omaha, Nebraska, KBBT in Portland, Oregon and KPEK in Albuquerque.
Soft AC.
Known as "the acoustic equivalent to Prozac", soft AC (an older-oriented version of AC) began during the late 1970s. Greater Media introduced its Magic format at WMGK in Philadelphia in 1975. WEEI-FM in Boston was the first station to use the term "soft rock", with advertising slogans such as "Fleetwood Mac...without the yack" and "Joni...without the baloney". The longest-running adult-contemporary format in the top ten U.S. markets is 103.7 Lite FM KVIL in Dallas-Fort Worth. KVIL went on the air in 1962, adopting its current format in 1969. In 1982, WMJX Magic 106.7 in Boston debuted with a soft adult-contemporary format and became the most popular music station in its market. The following year, the Lite format debuted in New York (WLTW) and Chicago (WLIT). KOST in Los Angeles, formerly a beautiful music station, switched to soft adult contemporary that year. Other names for the format include "warm", "sunny", "bee" (or "B") and EZ Rock, and it combines the middle-of-the-road, beautiful music, easy listening and soft rock formats. Some soft adult-contemporary stations capitalize on their appeal to office workers (females aged 25–54, a key advertiser demographic), calling themselves stations "everyone at work can agree on".
In 1995 Broadcast Programming introduced a syndicated format, AC45+. BP programmer and consultant Mike Bettelli said that adult contemporary stations had dropped Neil Diamond, Kenny Rogers, Barbra Streisand, Anne Murray and Barry Manilow, adding Take That and Bon Jovi. Adult standards and easy listening were for older listeners, and women aged 45–54 were overlooked. A sample hour of the format included Chicago, Olivia Newton-John, Elton John, Smokey Robinson, Bobby Darin, Christopher Cross, Vanessa L. Williams, Simon & Garfunkel, Manilow, Whitney Houston, Charlie Rich, Billy Joel, Maureen McGovern and Lionel Richie; songs by Frank Sinatra, Mariah Carey and Michael Bolton were also played.
Urban AC.
Urban adult contemporary music is geared to adult African-American audiences, playing R&B and soul music rather than hip-hop. Examples of urban AC stations include WBLS in New York, WHUR in Washington D.C., and KJLH in Los Angeles. Sirius XM Satellite Radio features the format on its Heart & Soul channel.
The rhythmic adult contemporary format focuses on uptempo disco, early hip-hop, R&B and dance music for African-American, Hispanic and white audiences. Stations include WKTU in New York, WISX in Philadelphia and KQMV in Seattle.
The rhythmic oldies format focuses on old-school R&B and soul hits from the 1960s to the 1990s, including Motown and disco. The format, also known as "jammin'" or "groovin'" oldies, was pioneered in 1997 by KCMG-FM ("Mega 100") in Los Angeles. Before its popularity faded, it included white artists such as ABBA and the Bee Gees. Rhythmic-oldies stations, targeting an African-American audience, include WRBO-FM in Memphis, Tennessee and WWWS-AM in Buffalo, New York.
A late-night quiet storm format blends urban and soft adult-contemporary music: ballads and slow jams, primarily by African-American and Latino artists. Keith Sweat hosts the "Keith Sweat Hotel", a nightly syndicated quiet-storm program.
Christmas music.
Some soft adult-contemporary stations play Christmas music in November and December. Although many are contemporary seasonal recordings by artists played in the usual format, vintage songs by older pop, MOR, and adult standards artists such as Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, the Carpenters, Percy Faith, Johnny Mathis and Andy Williams are also heard.
British broadcasters have a Christmas holiday schedule from the first Monday of the school holidays to New Year's Day. Christmas music on U.S. and Canadian radio stations typically begins the week before Thanksgiving Day, ending after Christmas or New Year's Day; a later end may coincide with a format change. Stations sometimes begin the holiday format earlier, in late October or early November, although such music outside the Christmas and holiday season has been unpopular with listeners. The roots of this tradition trace back to the beautiful music and easy listening stations of the 1960s and 1970s. These stations introduced Christmas music into their playlists around Thanksgiving, playing Christmas music exclusively for 36 or 48 hours around Christmas Day. An all-Christmas format beginning around Thanksgiving began at a few stations during the mid-1990s.

Stefan Czmil

Stefan Czmil (20 October 1914 – 22 January 1978) was a Ukrainian Eastern Catholic known for his missionary work in Argentina as well as for work in his native Ukraine and Italy. According to Ukrainian Catholic Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, Pope Francis was mentored by Czmil and therefore knows the Byzantine liturgy well.
Early life.
Father Czmil was born in Sudova Vyshnya a small town in western Ukraine, some 30 kilometers from the Polish border Rawa Ruska/Medyka. His parents, Stefan and Julia Szydlowska, were Ukrainian patriots and Christians, who instilled into their son a love of Ukraine and the Greek-Catholic Church, as the Ukrainian Catholic Church then was officially known. After the first school years in his native town, in 1925 he was sent to the Ukrainian all-boys gymnasium in Peremyshl Przemysl, Poland, Ukrainian town under Polish rule whose catechist was Father Petro Holynskyj. Stefan Czmil joined the Salesian Congregation. It was his goal to educate poor youths in Ukraine in the same manner as Saint John Bosco did in his time in Italy.
Career.
In 1930 the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, Cardinal Cicognani, turned to Pope Pius XI asking him permission for Eastern rite candidates to the Salesians to retain their rite and Church traditions; it was granted. At the same time, Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, Head of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church (1901-1944), designated Josafat Kotsylovskyj, Bishop of the Diocese of Peremyshl, to inform the Gymnasium’s students of his intentions to send to Italy those willing to become Salesians. When the Salesian Superiors adhered to the projected plan of accepting candidates from Ukraine to the Salesian brotherhood, allowing them to retain their rite and Church traditions, Stefan Czmil and nine others expressed their intention to become Salesians. In 1932 they went to the town of Ivrea, in Northern Italy, where the Salesians had their school for candidates to the Salesian brotherhood.
After graduating from the school of Salesian aspirants Czmil was admitted to the Salesian Novitiate in Villa Moglia (Chieri) in 1935. He took his three-year temporary vows in 1936.
Education.
He studied Philosophy (1936-1939) at the Salesian College of Philosophical Studies in Foglizzo (Turin), then interrupted his studies for a two-year educative stage amongst the novices of Villa Moglia, after which he was admitted to the Salesian House of Studies in Bolengo for his Theology (1941-1945), during World War II. Ordained a priest in 1945 by the Apostolic Visitator for Ukrainian émigrés in Western Europe, Ivan Buchko, he followed up his studies with a baccalaureate in Pedagogy in 1947 at the Salesian Pontifical Athenaeum in Turin. Before that he was assigned as a tourist guide at the Catacombes of Saint Callistus in Rome under Salesian Administration, where he met scores of Ukrainian refugees unable to return to their homeland, who he helped to find new abode. He was also a teacher in the Salesian school of Valdocco (Turin) and an assistant in the Salesian Motherhouse of Valdocco to the Salesian Missionaries who came from overseas for a period of rest.
Missionary work.
In 1948, with the assent of his superiors, Czmil was sent by the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches for a twelve-year period of apostolic and missionary work with Ukrainian immigrants in Argentina (Haedo and Ramos Mejia, suburbs of Buenos Aires). The local political authorities were not willing or ready to accept a different religious rite to the Roman Catholicism of Argentina. Czmil became the new Director of the Seminary, which had 110 seminarians including a fair number of teachers. Under his Directorate the school received the title of "Pontifical", mainly due to the intervention of Patriarch Josyf Slipyj, head of the Greek-Catholic Church.

Boundary vector field

The boundary vector field (BVF) is an external force for parametric active contours (i.e. Snakes). In the fields of computer vision and image processing, parametric active contours are widely used for segmentation and object extraction. The active contours move progressively towards its target based on the external forces. There are a number of shortcomings in using the traditional external forces, including the capture range problem, the concave object extraction problem, and high computational requirements.
The BVF is generated by an interpolation scheme which reduces the computational requirement significantly, and at the same time, improves the capture range and concave object extraction capability.
The BVF is also tested in moving object tracking and is proven to provide fast detection method for real time video applications.

Finca Los Alamos

Finca Los Alamos is a historical Argentine estancia located in San Rafael, Mendoza. The estate was built in 1830 by the Bombal family, and originally served as a frontier fort. Domingo Bombal, who served eleven terms as Governor to the Mendoza Province (between 1863–1890), owned the estate until his death in 1908.
After decades of neglect, the property was revived by Argentine writer Susana Bombal in the 1930s. Susana brought touches of Buenos Aires sophistication to the newly restored property, including colonial furniture, original manuscripts and mural paintings. She was friends with a number of bohemian artists from the 1930s-60s who made the retreat to Finca Los Alamos, south of Mendoza. Each visiting artist added special touches that remain today, making the property a museum of sorts, and truly unique. Susana, who shared a profound friendship with author and poet Jorge Luis Borges, owned the property until 1992. The property features original works of art and culture from many famous Argentinean figures including Borges, Raúl Soldi, Hector Basaldua, and Manuel Mujica Láinez.
The estate, which now serves as a boutique hotel, is still owned by the Bombal family, who also run the hotel.
Features.
The property includes "El Laberinto de Borges" (Borges Memorial Maze), a garden labyrinth planted in 2003, which consists of approximately 12,000 English Boxwood shrubs. The box hedge maze measures by , and was designed by Randoll Coate, a British diplomat, maze designer, and "labyrinthologist". The maze pays tribute to Jorge Luis Borges (also a personal friend of Coate's) and may have been inspired by Borges' short stories "El Jardin de senderos que se bifurcan" (The Garden of Forking Paths), and Labyrinths. Shaped like an open book, the design spells out Borges' name as reflected in a mirror, and also pays tribute to writer Maria Kodama, Jorge's widow, by including her initials.
In literature.
The estate is featured in the book "Estancias, The Great Houses and Ranches of Argentina", by Maria Saenz Quesada. The book details over thirty historical Argentine properties with origins as far back as the 16th century, through their rise at the end of the 18th century (when these estates played an integral role in making Argentina one of the world's most powerful economic empires), and the significant functions of these estancias today. The book suggests that Los Alamos may be the oldest house to survive the 1861 Mendoza earthquake that devastated the Province.

Edward E. Boynton House

The Edward E. Boynton House was built in Rochester, New York in 1908. This two-story house is built in the elongated "T" plan. Frank Lloyd Wright won agreement from Boynton to not only design the house but also design the landscape and furnishings as well. It's the furthest east of Wright's Prairie houses.
History.
Edward Boynton was a successful lantern salesman and partner in the C. T. Ham Manufacturing Co. of Rochester. Boynton learned of Frank Lloyd Wright through a business partner, Warren McArthur. Wright had built the Warren McArthur House in the Kenwood District of Chicago in 1892. In 1907, Wright came to Rochester to help Edward and his daughter Beulah select a site for their home. Boynton bought four city lots on East Blvd., which would provide space for an expansive garden with rectangular reflecting pool accented with a semicircular bed of flowering plants, and tennis courts, and give that open prairie feel Wright was looking for. The plans also called for 28 American elm trees on the property.
Boynton's daughter helped him work with Wright on the design of the house as his wife had died years earlier. Wright and Beulah Boynton established a great architect-client relationship - not always the case for Wright with his clients. Wright incorporated many of her suggestions into the structure and design. Wright would frequently and unexpectedly show up at the site during construction and once there, never leave the house for 2 to 3 days - often sleeping in makeshift sheds set up by the workmen.
The home is oriented sideways on the lot. The living room is extended west by a veranda which aims towards the street. The dining room is very large and includes rows of leaded art glass windows on each floor, with separate designs for casements and clerestory windows and overhead light panels. The veranda was later enclosed and the same art glass added to it. The cost of the house and site was $55,000.00, a large sum in 1908. The Boyntons lived in the house until 1918. 
In 1932, Frank Lloyd Wright returned to Rochester for a lecture at the Memorial Art Gallery and was distressed to discover the gardens and tennis courts gone, the house surrounded by other homes, and the remains of the reflecting pool on a neighbor's property, remarking "That's the last time I'll design for a space I've never seen. I thought it was sited on a hilltop surrounded by a stretching expanse of space." After several owners, the Landmark Society purchased the house, then sold it with covenants to protect the exterior and interior, including the original Wright designed furniture, now owned by the Landmark Society. This home is still a private residence. The elms are gone, a casualty of Dutch elm disease in the 1960s.
As a result of harsh weather conditions in Rochester and problems with the original design, its upkeep has been a continual problem, as documented in detail by one resident who grew up in the house. An extensive restoration project (both inside and out) was completed in 2012. The two and a half year restoration project was undertaken by the present owners of the house, Francis J. Cosentino and his wife Jane E. Parker, who purchased the house in 2009 for $830,000. The progress of the restoration work was documented in a Rochester, N.Y., Public Broadcasting Station channel WXXI program entitled, "Frank Lloyd Wright's Boynton House: The Next Hundred Years."
The Rochester, N.Y. based architecture firm, Bero Architecture PLLC, was the lead firm in the restoration of the house. The outdoor space was designed by Mark H. Bayer and his team from Bayer Landscape Architecture, PLLC, Rochester. All of the windows and other glass in the house, including light fixtures and glass-fronted cabinet doors, were painstakingly restored by glass artist and Wisconsin native, Jeffrey Mueller, owner of Godfrey Müller Studios, a glass restoration company in Rochester. The existing Wright designed furniture and all the woodwork in the house, some of which had been painted over time by previous owners, was meticulously refinished, repaired, and restored by Eric Norden, owner of Eric Norden Restorations, in Rochester. The new furniture was designed in the spirit of Wright collaborator, George Niedecken, from designs for furniture in other Wright designed Prairie School homes. Darryl Gronsky, an interior designer in Rochester, along with the input of homeowner Jane Parker, referred to Niedecken’s designs archived and in the collection of the Milwaukee Art Museum, Milwaukee, Wis. to help select and purchase materials and fabrics for the renovated home. Bero Architecture had the new furniture in the Niedecken-Wright spirit manufactured. The cost of the restoration was over $2 million.
The house is part of the East Avenue Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
