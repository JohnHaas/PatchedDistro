Collaborative leadership

Collaborative leadership is a management practice which is focused on the leadership skills across functional and organizational boundaries. The term started to appear in the mid-1990s in response to the twin trends of the growth in strategic alliances between private corporations and the formation of long term public private partnership contracts to rebuild public infrastructure.
Defining Collaborative Leadership.
In her 1994 Harvard Business Review article "Collaborative Advantage", Rosabeth Moss Kanter talks about leaders who recognize that there are critical business relationships "that cannot be controlled by formal systems but require (a) dense web of interpersonal connections…". And in a book published in that same year Chrislip and Larson looked at the attributes of great civic leaders in communities across the US and found some similar attributes. "Collaboration needs a different kind of leadership; it needs leaders who can safeguard the process, facilitate interaction and patiently deal with high levels of frustration"
In 2013, Harvard Business Review authors Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas (co-founders of The InterSector Project), explore the complex relationship between the business, government and social sectors as it relates to their role in addressing the most pressing challenges facing society -- issues like managing resource constraints, controlling health care costs, training the twenty-first century workforce, developing and implementing smart-grid and intelligent-urbanization technologies, and stabilizing financial systems to foster sustainable economic growth. Their research suggests that the future of collaborative leadership depends on the ability of leaders to engage and collaborate with the business, government and social sectors (see below for the distinguishing characteristics of such leaders).
Hank Rubin author and President of the Institute of Collaborative Leadership has written "A collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome." In his book "Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools" Rubin asks "Who is a collaborative leader?" and answers "You are a collaborative leader once you have accepted responsibility for building - or helping to ensure the success of - a heterogeneous team to accomplish a shared purpose . Your tools are (1) the purposeful exercise of your behavior, communication, and organizational resources in order to affect the perspective, beliefs, and behaviors of another person (generally a collaborative partner) to influence that person's relationship with you and your collaborative enterprise and (2) the structure and climate of an environment that supports the collaborative relationship."
David Archer and Alex Cameron in their book "Collaborative Leadership: How to succeed in an interconnected world", identify the basic task of the collaborative leader as the delivery of results across boundaries between different organisations. They say "Getting value from difference is at the heart of the collaborative leader's task… they have to learn to share control, and to trust a partner to deliver, even though that partner may operate very differently from themselves."
Key lessons for leaders.
There have been a number of research projects and reviews of key lessons for Collaborative leaders but they all come down to some similar themes. 
Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas (co-founders of The InterSector Project) writing for the Harvard Business Review, interviewed over 100 leaders who have demonstrated their ability to engage and collaborate across the business, government and social sectors and found six distinguishing characteristics:
Madeleine Carter, writing for the Center for Effective Public Policy as part of research project funded by the United States Department of Justice and State Justice Institute, defines five qualities of a collaborative leader:
In a similar way, Archer and Cameron list ten key lessons for a successful collaborative leader:
Rod Newing writing in a Financial Times supplement special report says "If a collaboration is to be effective, each party must recognise and respect the different culture of the other". And traditional development paths don't prepare leaders well for this "traditional management development, is based on giving potential managers a team of people and a set of resources to control - and success is rewarded with more people and more resources to control. By contrast, collaboration requires managers to achieve success through people and resources outside their control and for this they have had no preparation".
Applications of collaborative leadership.
The need for collaborative leadership is being recognised in more and more areas;
An Ipsos MORI research report published in 2007 found that relationship management and collaborative leadership were the top two qualities or capabilities that Directors of organisations involved in large business partnerships would have liked to have had more access to when setting up or running a partnership.

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (South African game show)

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was a South African game show based on the original British format of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?". The show was hosted by Jeremy Maggs. The main goal of the game was to win 1 million rand by answering 15 multiple-choice questions correctly. There were three "lifelines" - 50:50, Phone a Friend and Ask the Audience. "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" was shown on the South African TV station SABC3 (earlier M-Net). When a contestant got the fifth question correct, he left with at least 1,000 rand. When a contestant got the tenth question correct, he left with at least 32,000 rand. Four seasons of the show were made. There was a project of making this show in Afrikaans, but it wasn't realised.
David Paterson was the only million rand winner, on 19 March 2000. He was also the first winner outside of the United States.

Rourkela Airport

Rourkela Airport (IATA: RRK, ICAO: VERK) is a private airport located near Chhend Colony, 6 kilometres west of the steel city of Rourkela in the state of Odisha. It is mostly used by dignitaries visiting Rourkela, especially officials of Steel Authority of India Limited(SAIL) and other V.I.Ps.The planes from this airport also travel to the city of Kolkata.
History.
The airstrip was constructed by the Tata Iron and Steel Company in 1950s for the purpose of carrying officials of the company, who regularly visited the area to survey and supervise the transportation of dolomite and other minerals from the district of Sundargarh for their industry. Small planes used to fly daily between Rourkela and Jamshedpur carrying the officials between these two steel cities.
In 1961, this airport was taken by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). With the construction of the new airport, Vayudoot started Flight PF-715 flying daily between Ranchi and Kolkata via Rourkela. Also another flight between Ranchi and Bhubaneswar via Rourkela used to operate in the late 80s. Air services to Rourkela were stopped in early 90s when Vayudoot suffered heavy losses and reduced its operations from serving 105 airports to just 45 airports. In 1994 the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) took control of the airport from AAI. The airport is still used by SAIL to receive its private jets.
A three member survey team of AAI that made a spot assessment of the Rourkela airstrip in October 2007 to find out the feasibility of re-introduction of air connectivity to the city expressed satisfaction over the existing infrastructure. Air Odisha (AOAPL) started charter flights flying everyday between Rourkela, Jharsuguda and Bhubaneswar to Kolkata on 1 November 2012.

Where I Come From (Alan Jackson song)

"Where I Come From" is a song written and performed by American country music singer Alan Jackson. It was released in July 2001 as the third single from his album "When Somebody Loves You". In November 2001, the song became Jackson's eighteenth Number One hit on the "Billboard" country charts.
Content.
The song is a moderate up-tempo which finds the narrator, a truck driver, traveling across the United States and finding himself in various situations that make him think about how life in other places is different from his Southern lifestyle. 
The first verse finds him pulled over by a police officer, who says that he "don't know about that accent". In the second verse, the narrator stops at a diner to have a barbecue dinner, which he claims ain't like Mama fixed it. In the third verse, he is stopped after losing his universal joint, when he is met by a lady who asks if "he has plans for dinner", and finally, in the fourth and final verse, he is asked on the CB radio if he is from Tulsa. After each verse comes a chorus where the narrator explains how the road life is different.

<doc id="20028166" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20028166" title="William Atwood">
William Atwood

William Atwood (c.1650-1712) was an English lawyer, known also as a political and historical writer.
Early life.
William Atwood was son and heir of John Atwood of Broomfield, Essex. He studied at Queen's College, Cambridge, before being admitted to the Inner Temple in 1669 and Gray's Inn in 1670, and becoming a Barrister in 1674.
He acted for the defence for Henry Booth, Lord Delamere at his treason trial in 1685-6. Booth was accused of participation in Monmouth's Rebellion, and the judge in the case was Judge Jeffreys, as Lord High Steward. The defence secured an acquittal.
In New York.
He became Chief Justice of New York in 1701; in 1697 the Privy Council in London had moved to set up colonial vice-admiralty courts, able to act quickly in matters of piracy (a live matter in New York at the time), and wrecks. He was removed a year later, by Lord Cornbury, on a corruption charge. 
Atwood's position was in fact made very difficult by the governors and the factional politics of New York, after the death of Jacob Leisler. Atwood had presided at the treason trial of mayor Nicholas Bayard (c.1644-1707) of the anti-Leislerian party, at the time of governor Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont. Bellomont was both a major sponsor of William Kidd, charged with piracy, and a Leislerian. When Bellomont died in 1701, the change of governor when Cornbury took over meant a complete about-turn for the local factions, and undermined Atwood's position.
In the aftermath, Atwood tried to justify himself, but with little success. His later attack on the poet Matthew Prior, in the anonymous "A Modern Inscription to the Duke of Marlborough's Fame", was not only a Whig taking issue with a Tory, but had a peripheral connection with the business of his removal as Justice. Prior was a Commissioner for Trade and Plantations, and this Commission had upheld Cornbury's action.
Writing.
His "Fundamental Constitution of the English Government" (1690) argued that Parliament could act to fill a vacancy in the monarchy. In it he also objected to John Locke's theory, that such a vacancy, which had occurred in 1689, was subject to popular sovereignty. It is regarded as a clarifying statement of the moderate Whig position on the political settlement after the Glorious Revolution.
He wrote also on Scotland, causing the Scottish Parliament to order his works to be burned, by the common hangman: the objectionable "The Superiority and Direct Dominion of the Imperial Crown of England" (1704), and "The Scots Patriot Unmasked". The sentence was carried out in August 1705 at the Market Cross in Edinburgh, a month after James Drake's "Historia Anglo-Scotica" suffered the same fate. The well-paid James Anderson answered Atwood's case against Scottish independence, in 1705. Atwood replied with "The Superiority and Direct Dominion of the Imperial Crown of England ... Reasserted" (1705). Atwood was also answered by James Dalrymple, who argued that the Scottish church had always been independent.

Vegetable carving

Vegetable carving is the art of carving vegetables to form beautiful objects, such as flowers or birds. 
The origins of vegetable carving.
The origins of vegetable carving are disputed: some believe it to have begun in Japan in ancient times, others believe it to have begun in Sukothai, Thailand 700 years ago, while still others believe that vegetable carving originated in the time of the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-906) and the Sung Dynasty (AD 960-1279) in China. 
Japan.
Japan has also been referred to as the root of the art of fruit and vegetable carving, called Mukimono in Japanese. According to the book "Japanese Garnishes, The Ancient Art of Mukimono", by Yukiko and Bob Haydok, Mukimono's origins began in ancient times when food was served on unglazed clay pottery. These rough platters were covered with a leaf before the food was plated. Artistic chefs realized that the cutting or folding of the leaf in different ways created a more attractive presentation. Mukimono did not become popular until the sixteenth century, the Edo period, when Mukimono gained official recognition. At this time, street artists created clever garnishes upon request. From these beginnings the art has developed into a very important part of every Japanese chef's training.
Thailand.
Another popular theory of the history of vegetable carving is that it originates in Thailand. It started during the Loi Kratong festival in the 14th century. During Loi Kratong, rafts are individually decorated using many objects, including banana leaves and flowers.
In the year 1364, one of King Phra Ruang’s servants, Nang Noppamart, had the desire to create a unique decoration for her raft. Nang carved a flower from a vegetable using a real flower as a pattern. She carved a bird as well and set it beside the flower. Using these carvings, she created a raft that stood out above the rest. King Phra Ruang was impressed by the grace and beauty of the carving and decreed that every woman should learn this new art.
As the centuries passed, enthusiasm for this art waxed and waned. In 1808, King Rama II loved vegetable carving so much so that he wrote poetry about it. However, during the 1932 revolution in Thailand, appreciation for vegetable carving died down. In order to revive interest, it is taught from the age of 11 in primary schools through secondary school in Thailand. Optional courses are also offered in universities throughout Thailand.
Vegetable carving today.
Whatever way vegetable carving originated, it is now known and practised worldwide. Vegetable carving is flaunted in many different Asian restaurants, cruises, hotels, and other various places.
In the mid 20th Century, the art of vegetable carving began to grow outside Asia. Since then other cultures have slowly come to appreciate the beauty and culture associated with the practice. Today, one can marvel at vegetable carving throughout the world.
The products of vegetable carving are generally flowers or birds; however, the only limit is one’s imagination. The techniques of vegetable carving vary from person to person, as does the final result. Some carvings present more artistic detail, while others have simple, yet beautiful shapes. Vegetable carving is generally used as a garnish, but it can also be used for flower arranging.

Equivalent narcotic depth

Equivalent narcotic depth (END) is used in technical diving as a way of estimating the narcotic effect of a breathing gas mixture, such as heliox and trimix. The method is, for a given mix and depth, to calculate the depth which would produce the same narcotic effect when breathing air.
The equivalent narcotic depth of a breathing gas mix at a particular depth is calculated by finding the depth of a dive when breathing air that would have the same total partial pressure of nitrogen and oxygen as the breathing gas in question.
For example, a trimix containing 20% oxygen, 40% helium, 40% nitrogen (trimix 20/40) being used at has an END of .
Calculations.
Metres.
The equivalent narcotic depth can be calculated for depths in metres as follows:
Working the earlier example, for a gas mix containing 40% helium being used at 60 metres, the END is:
So at 60 metres on this mix, the diver would feel the same narcotic effect as a dive on air to 32 metres.
Feet.
The equivalent narcotic depth can be calculated for depths in feet as follows:
Working the earlier example, for a gas mix containing 40% helium being used at 200 feet, the END is:
So at 200 feet on this mix, the diver would feel the same narcotic effect as a dive on air to 107 feet.
Oxygen Narcosis.
Since there is evidence that oxygen plays a part in the narcotic effects of a gas mixture, the NOAA diving manual recommends treating oxygen and nitrogen as equally narcotic.
This is now preferred to the previous method of considering only nitrogen as narcotic, since it is more conservative.
In this analysis, it is assumed that the narcotic potentials of nitrogen and oxygen are similar.
Although oxygen has greater lipid solubility than nitrogen and therefore should be more narcotic (Meyer-Overton correlation), it is likely that some of the oxygen is metabolised, thus reducing its effect to a level similar to that of nitrogen.

Von Schmidt auf Altenstadt

Von Schmidt auf Altenstadt, (also von) was a German noble family whose seat was at Schloss Gattendorf outside Hof, Bavaria near the Czech border. Also known as Schmidt von Altenstadt, it had branches in other countries including the Netherlands, and Russia, where its members also distinguished themselves. In 1861, one branch received a baronial title from the King of Württemberg.
Johann Fabricius, originally surnamed Schmidt, had altered his name to the Latin form "Fabricius", in order to attract the attention of the Emperor. He served Maximilian II against the Turks and was given a coat of arms by the imperial Letters Patent of 2 November 1564. His son Martin was ennobled on 10 December 1577. They were granted a swan coat-of-arms where the swan is in an attack position on the shield; this is repeated in miniature "above the crown".
In 1638 the Fabricius family reverted to their former surname of Schmidt and on 23 February 1713 were granted the additive "auf Altenstadt". The native city of the family was Hof but they had a village called Schmidt where there was a castle called Burg Hengebach four miles away from the town of Heimbach.
On 18 October 1712/23 February 1713 the Emperor Charles VI granted augmentation of a knight's arm holding a sword to the swan coat-of-arms, to heirs Anton Johann Christoph, Johann Georg, and Christopher Wolf (successive lords of Gattendorf). The three brothers succeeded each other, one after the other, as lords of Gattendorf; the first two died without heirs. The third brother had children and the line continued.
Hans-Georg Schmidt von Altenstadt (21 August 1904 − 25 July 1944) was the last baron von Altenstadt of the castle Schloss Gattendorf and the last in life of the aristocratic family Von Schmidt auf Altenstadt. He reached the rank of Generalmajor 1 July 1944. Although the family is officially extinct, genetic connections to the family are still to be found in the United States. A direct descendant from Johann Schmidt/Fabricius exists within the UK.
Hans-Georg Schmidt von Altenstadt was the author of the book, "Unser Weg zur Meer" {http://biblioman.es/articleHistoricaAntiqua5759/32744.htm}.
The family's Schloss castle is now a hotel it is run by the city of Gattendorf.
The Dutch branch.
The Dutch branch was established by a daughter of the family in the fifth generation: (5) Maria Magdalena (6 November 1725 - 10 March 1781) married Dutch nobleman Johann Caspar von Scheidlin who took the name of von Schmidt auf Altenstadt on marriage and is the ancestor of the branch that uses the title "Jonkheer", with descent to modern days. 
The Russian branch.
Christoph August von Schmidt was ennobled by Tsar Aleksandr I of Russia. He erected the Hof memorial stone and was created "Baron of the Russian Empire" and awarded knighthoods in the orders of Sts. Ann-and-Vladimir and the Order of St. Stanislaus, Russia's highest order, after serving as Kollegianrat (Provost) of the University of St. Petersburg. His daughter by his second marriage (1824) to Eudoxia Bruce, Eudoxia Schmidt von Altenstadt (born 1825, a goddaughter of Czar Alexander I shortly before his death), married a Russian nobleman (Alexander Gordon) and his grandsons, Peter and Paul Gordon lived at Neva Beach, St. Petersburg, Russia. Theresien Schmidts Gedenkstein is an important monument in the city of Hof, Bavaria.
The municipality of Gattendorf elected to adopt a version of the coat of arms posthumously in 1974 to commemorate the family.

St. Matthew's Church (Seat Pleasant, Maryland)

St. Matthew's Church, also known as Addison Chapel, is a historic Episcopal church located at Seat Pleasant, Prince George's County, Maryland. Although the current chapel (the third on this site) was built about 1809, its simple Anglican styling reflects the Colonial-era, Church of England-influenced designs, of which few remain. Addison Chapel was first established in 1696 as a chapel of ease for St. John's at Broad Creek. The parish it serves was one of the thirty original Maryland parishes and was named for Colonel John Addison, of Oxon Hill plantation, a leading proponent of the Anglican Church. His descendant Walter Dulaney Addison, who was for a term Chaplain of the Senate also served as rector here. The church is a small one-story rectangular brick building laid in Flemish bond.

My Delirium

"My Delirium" is a New Wave song performed by New Zealander musician Ladyhawke. The third track on Ladyhawke's eponymous debut album, the song was released as a single on 8 December 2008. The most commercially successful single of Ladyhawke's to date, "My Delirium" sold over 70,000 copies in Australia, peaked at number 9 on the New Zealand Music Charts, number 8 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and has reached the Top 50 in UK and Denmark.
Background and writing.
"My Delirium" was written by Ladyhawke, alongside Hannah Robinson and Pascal Gabriel, both of whom Ladyhawke worked with on her previous single. Ladyhawke later said she was looking for high-powered producers to collaborate with. Ladyhawke wrote "My Delirium" after suffering a lack of sleep due to jetlag and feeling a sense of homesickness. According to co-writer Robinson, 'My Delerium' and 'Dusk Till Dawn' were both written on their first and only session together. Ladyhawke, when describing her songwriting process, stated she tries "to keep simple hooky guitar riffs throughout the tracks..." and she "wanted to capture the 'happy sad' vibe that so many eighties classics had."
Critical reception.
"My Delirium" received several positive reviews from critics. Nisha Diu of "The Sunday Telegraph" described "My Delirium" as "...a moody, energetic anthem underscored by insistent drums and a soulful vocal..." Popjustice described the song as "brilliant", and Digital Spy entertainment reporter David Balls labelled the song as a "glorious slice of indie-electronica". In its review, Allmusic said the song "echoes the power pop of The Bangles and The Go-Go's". Not all reviews were positive; Artistdirects Nathan Atnikov labelled the song, along with the entire "Ladyhawke" album, as "musically bland", and as "pedestrian dance music". Frazier McAlpine, on a BBC blog, described "My Delirium" as "grumpily delivered", and called Ladyhawke's voice "sulky" and "mardy-teen".
Music video.
The music video for "My Delirium" was directed by Benji Davies and Jim Field, together known as Frater.
The video starts with Ladyhawke in a roadside motel looking out the window while packing her bags. The video then transitions into an animated picture on the wall, depicting Ladyhawke leaving the motel and driving along a remote desert road in a Ford Thunderbird (all allusions to Thelma & Louise). As the video continues, the desert road backdrop becomes more unusual, with landmarks such as Mount Rushmore with the heads of cats being passed by, until the bridge, where the car is seen to drive off a cliff and begins to fly (another allusion to Thelma & Louise). The video then continues with Ladyhawke playing the guitar in watercolour, and driving through space. The video finishes by fading out of the picture and back into the now-empty motel room.
When producing the music video, Frater collaborated with Sarah Larnach, who also drew the album cover for the "Ladyhawke" album and her singles. Larnach painted nearly all of the background scenes, and the images of Ladyhawke and the car were created using a rotoscope layering technique.
Chart performance.
"My Delirium" is Ladyhawke's most commercially successful song to date, having charted higher than both "Paris is Burning" and "Dusk Till Dawn" on the UK, Australian, and New Zealand charts. The song started charting on digital downloads, debuting at number 119 on the UK Singles Chart three weeks before its physical release. The next week it rose 44 places to number 75 with two weeks until its physical release, before continuing to rise to a peak of number 33 on 20 December. In New Zealand, the song debuted at number thirty on 2 February 2009 before peaking at number nine in its seventeenth week on the chart. It was certified Gold on 13 September 2009, selling over 7,500 copies. In Australia, the song peaked at number eight on 1 February after thirteen weeks. It has also been certified Platinum, selling over 70,000 copies. In Denmark, the song peaked at number 36, yet failed to beat "Paris is Burning" on the European charts, which had peaked at 33.
The release of "My Delirium" followed the release of "Dusk Till Dawn", which only managed to chart in the United Kingdom at a peak of number 78. "Paris is Burning" was the most successful release previously - it had been featured on the TV show ""Ugly Betty"", and peaked at number 40 on the New Zealand charts. Following the release of "My Delirium", "Paris is Burning" was re-released and outperformed its previous chart positions.

Leeann Ward of Country Universe gave the song an A grade," saying that it "showcases production that still sounds vibrant almost twenty years later" and the song has "steel guitar and honky tonk piano aplenty." She goes on to say that the song’s "concept is accentuated by its clever title and Jackson’s amusingly mournful delivery, including a pitiful 'yee haw' that ends up sounding more funny than sad, which ultimately describes the song as a whole, despite the theme of lost love."
Music video.
The video was directed by Jim Shea and was released in October 1992.

"She's Got the Rhythm (And I Got the Blues)" debuted at number 42 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of October 24, 1992.

CS Turnu Severin

Clubul Sportiv Turnu Severin was a Romanian professional football club from Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Mehedinţi County, founded in 2007 and dissolved in 2013. In 2012, the team promoted to the Liga I for the first time in their short history. After just one year of top football it relegated and was dissolved.
History.
The club was founded in the summer of 2007 after the merger of "Gaz Metan Podari" and "CFR Craiova". It was enrolled in the Liga III for the 2007-08 season. They finished second in the series and participated in the play-offs for the promotion to the Liga II, but failed to qualify.
They finished first in the series the following season, 2008-09. Worthy of notice, the club promoted to the Liga II just two years into its existence.
The first season of Liga II football in history ended with an honorable 7th place finish. The following season the club finished 10th.
In the summer of 2011 the club moved from Craiova to Drobeta-Turnu Severin to continue the football tradition in this city after the dissolution of FC Drobeta-Turnu Severin. On 1 November 2011 head coach Cosmin Bodea was sacked and his former assistant Florin Pârvu was caretaker, until Marian Bondrea was installed as head coach on 9 November. In that moment, Gaz Metan was only 11th in the championship, after 12 rounds. From that moment on, the team started to climb, and after five consecutive wins jumped to third. Gaz Metan lost only one game in the second part of the season and kept the third place in the championship until the end. Because FC Timişoara, the team that finished first, didn't receive the licence for the first division, the Romanian Football Federation decided that the third place should promote instead. In that way, Gaz Metan Severin climbed to Liga I for the first time in history, and the city, Drobeta-Turnu Severin had a team in the first division after 71 years.
On June 18, 2012 the club was renamed from "CS Gaz Metan Severin" to "CS Turnu Severin".
The club relegated back to the Liga II after just one season of top football, finishing just 2 points behind the relegation line.
Shortly after, it was dissolved, thus Drobeta-Turnu Severin remaining without a football club for the second time in the last two years, after FC Drobeta-Turnu Severin was also dissolved in 2011.

Nizhnesvirsky Nature Reserve

The Nizhnesvirsky Nature Reserve (, lit. "Lower Svir Zapovednik") is a 416 km² (131 sq mi) zapovednik in Lodeynopolsky District of Leningrad Oblast, Russia, established on June 11, 1980 to protect landscapes of the eastern shore of Lake Ladoga. 
Geography.
The nature reserve occupies lowlands on the right bank of the lower Svir River, including a portion of the eastern shore of Lake Ladoga and its waters. The zapovednik's northern border coincides with the border of the Republic of Karelia. The areas across the border belong to Olonetsky Zakaznik.
History.
It was first proposed in the 1950s that protected areas on the eastern shore of Lake Ladoga be created. At the time, the proposals were rejected by the authorities. The expansion and the industrial growth of the city of Leningrad caused considerable impact on the ecology of surrounding areas, and it was again proposed that a protected area be established to study this impact. In 1976 a large-scale program started, and, in particular, Nizhnesvirsky Zakaznik was established. Eventually, the zakaznik was transformed into a nature reserve in 1980.
Fauna and flora.
It is an important stopover location for migratory birds. The zapovednik has a humid continental climate (Köppen's Dfb). The predominant tree species is Scots Pine. A considerable area is occupied by swamps.

Tall, Tall Trees

"Tall, Tall Trees" is a song co-written by American singers George Jones and Roger Miller. Both singers recorded their own versions: Jones on his 1958 album "Long Live King George", and Miller on his 1970 cover album "A Trip in the Country".
However, it was not until October 1995 that the song was released as a single, by Alan Jackson, as one of the newly recorded tracks for his 1995 compilation album "The Greatest Hits Collection". Jackson's cover was his eleventh Number One hit on the "Billboard" country charts.
Content.
The song is an up-tempo in which the narrator promises to his lover that he will give her anything she wants, whether it be a "big limousine", a "great big mansion", or "tall tall trees and all the water in the seas".
In the liner notes for his Greatest hits album, Alan wrote,""This is an old Roger Miller song I stumbled across. It's a real fun song with a Cajun feel. I've always been a big fan of Roger's and when it came time to record a couple of new songs for this greatest hits, I couldn't resist. After I recorded it, we found out that George Jones is a co-writer - I think George had even forgotten he'd written it. I'm proud to have the chance to record a song written by two of my favorites.""
Critical reception.
Deborah Evans Price, of "Billboard" magazine reviewed the song favorably, saying that Jackson's vocal "evokes the right combination of devotion and playfulness on this tune about a man who promises his love everything from a big mansion to tall, tall trees."
Music video.
The music video was directed by Sherman Halsey and premiered in October 1995 on CMT.
Chart positions.
"Tall, Tall Trees" debuted at number 51 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of October 21, 1995.

St. Thomas' Church (Upper Marlboro, Maryland)

St. Thomas' Church is a historic brick church in a picturesque rural setting, located at Croom, Prince George's County, Maryland. The original church was constructed between 1742 and 1745, and is one of the earliest Episcopal churches in Southern Maryland. 
History.
The church was completed on December 25, 1745, and was unofficially known as "Page's Chapel," as the landowner, Daniel Page, had been contracted to erect the structure. During the mid-19th century, St. Thomas' became its own parish and undertook Gothic Revival renovations and expansion under the direction of New York City architect, John W. Priest, an associate of Andrew Jackson Downing. In 1888, the frontal bell tower was erected in memory of Bishop Thomas John Claggett, first Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church consecrated in the United States. Recent restoration work, in 1954, was based on the specifications of the original 1740s building contract, but retained Priest's Gothic Revival additions. The church is surrounded on all sides by a cemetery, which contains the graves of many prominent citizens and old county families. A fence and cast iron gate posts with Gothic designs was installed in 1907.
One of the original founders and benefactors of St Thomas's church was Benedict Swingate Calvert (1730-1788) who was a Maryland Loyalist during the American Revolution. He was the son of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, the third Proprietor Governor of Maryland, (1699–1751), and may have been the grandson of King George I of England. His mother's identity is not known and, as he was illegitimate, he was not able to inherit his father's title or estates, which passed instead to his half brother Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771). He spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony. Calvert became wealthy through proprietarial patronage and became an important colonial official, but he would lose his offices and his political power, though not his land and wealth, during the American Revolution. He is buried beneath the chancel of the church. 
The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

Dhokra

Dhokra (, ) (also spelt Dokra) is non–ferrous metal casting using the lost-wax casting technique. This sort of metal casting has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. One of the earliest known lost wax artefacts is the dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro. The product of dhokra artisans are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. Dhokra horses, elephants, peacocks, owls, religious images, measuring bowls, and lamp caskets etc., are highly appreciated. The lost wax technique for casting of copper based alloys has also been found in China, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria, Central America and other places.
The process.
There are two main processes of lost wax casting: solid casting, and hollow casting. While the former is predominant in the south of India the latter is more common in Central and Eastern India. Solid casting does not use a clay core but instead a solid piece of wax to create the mould; hollow casting is the more traditional method and uses the clay core.
The first task in the lost wax hollow casting process consists of developing a clay core which is roughly the shape of the final cast image. Next, the clay core is covered by a layer of wax composed of pure bee’s wax, resin from the tree "Damara orientalis", and nut oil. The wax is then shaped and carved in all its finer details of design and decorations. It is then covered with layers of clay, which takes the negative form of the wax on the inside, thus becoming a mould for the metal that will be poured inside it. Drain ducts are left for the wax, which melts away when the clay is cooked. The wax is then replaced by the molten metal, often using brass scrap as basic raw material. The liquid metal poured in hardens between the core and the inner surface of the mould. The metal fills the mould and takes the same shape as the wax. The outer layer of clay is then chipped off and the metal icon is polished and finished as desired.
The name.
Dhokra Damar tribes are the traditional metalsmiths of West Bengal. Their technique of lost wax casting is named after their tribe, hence Dhokra metal casting. The tribe extends from Jharkhand to West Bengal and Orissa; members are distant cousins of the Chattisgarh Dhokras. A few hundred years ago the Dhokras of Central and Eastern India traveled south as far as Kerla and north as far as Rajasthan and hence are now found all over India.

Tanks in the Spanish Army

Tanks in the Spanish Army have over 90 years of history, from the French FT-17s first delivered in 1919 to the Leopard 2 of the early 21st century.
Overview.
The FT-17 took part in combat during the Rif War or the Second Moroccan War as its also called, and participated in the first amphibious landing with tanks in history, at Alhucemas. In 1925, the Spanish Army began to undertake a program to develop and produce a Spanish tank, heavily based on the French FT-17, called the Trubia A4. Although the prototype performed well during testing, the tank was never put into mass production. Spain also experimented with the Italian Fiat 3000, acquiring one tank in 1925, and with another indigenous tank program called the Landesa. However, none of these evolved into a major armor program, and as a result the FT-17 remained the most important tank, in numbers, in the Spanish Army until the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.
Between July 1936 and April 1939, during the Spanish Civil War, the two opposing armies received large quantities of tanks from foreign powers. Spain's Second Republic received tanks from the Soviet Union, many of which were captured by the Nationalists and pressed into service against their former masters, while the Nationalists were aided by the Germans and Italians. When the first batch of 50 T-26 was loaded off the Russian freighter Komsomol at the Spanish port of Cartagena on Oct 12, 1936, the Franco Rebellion of July 1936 had already evolved into a bloody civil war threatening the capital Madrid. The Russian government, anxious about losing the country to the Fascists, decided to support the Republicans in the same way the Italians and Germans supported the Nationalists. Hence, no less than 281 T-26 light tanks. The T-26 instantly played a dominant role whenever appearing on the battlefield as well as a further 50 BT-5 fast tanks which reached the Spanish shores by March of 1938. Sufficiently armoured against its machine gun equipped German and Italian counterparts and well armed with the 45mm gun, the T-26 was only threatened by artillery and land mines. 
The Spanish Civil War, fought between 1936–39, provided an opportunity for many European countries to evaluate new technologies and tactics, including armored warfare. At the beginning of the war, the Nationalist and Popular Fronts each possessed only five Renault FT light tanks, These were soon reinforced with even more imported tanks as Italy began supplying Nationalist Spain with L3/35 light tanks in August 1936. The Soviet Union soon followed suit by supplying the Popular Front with T-26 tanks in October 1936. Germany sent its first shipments of Panzer I light tanks to the Nationalist Front in September 1936. During the war, France and Poland provided the Popular Front with a number of additional FT light tanks. 
The Nationalist and Popular armies also designed and manufactured a number of their own tanks. The Nationalists, for example, began the war with three Trubia A4 prototypes, manufactured before the beginning of the conflict. They also completed the first prototype of the Verdeja light tank. This was designed to overcome the shortcomings of tanks provided by the Germans and the Italians, as well as Soviet tanks captured from the Popular Front. Popular Front production of armored vehicles was segmented throughout different areas of Spain. In the north, between 15 to 20 Carro Trubia-Naval tanks were manufactured at the factory in Sestao, conversely the Trubia factory had built only a single model Landesa tank.
The Spanish Civil War, although the testing grounds for the nations which would ultimately take part in World War II, proved inconclusive with regard to the proof of mechanized warfare. Despite attempts by Soviet, German and Italian advisers and soldiers to use newly devised mechanized theories, the lack of quality crews and the tanks, and the insufficient amount of tanks provided bad impressions on the usefulness of tanks on their own.
The Spanish Army ended the Spanish Civil War with a fleet of light tanks. Looking to field more modern and capable tanks, the Spanish government and army approved a venture to design and manufacture a better light tank, known as the Verdeja. Although the tank proved extremely capable, a lack of raw materials and incentives doomed the program to failure. Furthermore, the army's requirements were temporarily satisfied by the procurement of Panzer IVs in late 1943. However, the failure to acquire more Panzer IVs led Spain to field a largely antiquated collection of light tanks and an insufficient amount of medium tanks. In 1953, the United States and Spain signed a military aid program agreement which led to the supply of M47 Patton and M48 Patton tanks. The American decision to not allow Spain to deploy the new equipment during the war with Morocco caused Spain to look elsewhere for a supplement to their fleet of Patton tanks, ending with the procurement of the AMX-30E, based on the French AMX-30.
Almost immediately after, the Spanish Army and the Spanish Ministry of Defense began to look for a future Spanish tank. This turned into the Lince tank program. Despite numerous bids the Lince program failed, both for financial reasons and because of the decision to instead modernize the existing fleet of AMX-30Es, and to procure a large number of American M60 Patton tanks to replace the fleet of older Patton tanks. Over half of the AMX-30Es were upgraded to a standard known as the AMX-30EM2, while the rest suffered a more finite modification known as the AMX-30EM1. However, the M60s and modernized AMX-30Es did not provide Spain with a sufficiently modern tank for the next century. In 1994, the Spanish Ministry of Defense began to negotiate with the German government over the purchase of the Leopard 2. Ultimately, 108 Leopard 2A4s were procured and integrated into the Spanish Army, while 219 Leopard 2Es were built in Spain, based on the German Leopard 2A6. The Leopard 2E and Leopard 2A4 replaced the fleet of M60 Patton tanks, while Spain's AMX-30EM2s were replaced by Italian B1 Centauro anti-tank cavalry vehicles. Presently, the Spanish Army possesses 108 Leopard 2A4s and 219 Leopard 2Es.
Birth of the Spanish tank force: 1919–1926.
The Spanish army's interest in the tank began near the end of World War I, when a formal petition for one FT-17 light tank was made to the French government on 28 October 1918. This purchase, however, was not processed until 15 January 1919. Spain's "Comisión de Experiencias, Proyectos y Comprobación del Material de Guerra" (Experiences, Projects and Confirmation Commission) issued a formal order for a FT-17, armed with a cannon, and days later extended the order to include another three cannon armed tanks, and another FT-17 armed with a machine gun. On 5 March the order was authorized and then extended further to include two more FT-17s, armed with the cannon. On 20 March the French government declared that they could not process the sale, and on 12 April the process to acquire these vehicles began anew. In May 1919, the French acceded to the sale of a single FT-17 light tank to the Spanish Army, delivered the next month. This particular FT-17 was armed with an Hotchkiss machine gun, and was later re-armed with a Spanish machine gun. Upon inspection by the Spanish government, it was decided to procure another ten—including eight armed with machine guns and two armed with cannons. The French government declared that there were no vehicles available for sale, and later added that under no circumstances would they allow Spain to rearm these vehicles with the Spanish machine gun, and consequently denied the sale. As a result, Spain began to approach other governments, including Great Britain and the United States, but with no success.
Following Spain's colonial defeat at the Battle of Annual, on 22 July 1921, another military envoy was sent to France to petition for more tanks. This time, the French government consented and agreed to the sale of ten machine gun armed FT-17s and a single command tank. The command tank was an FT-17 chassis, with the turret replaced by a superstructure, carrying a single communications radio. These were presented to the third section of the "Escuela Central de Tiro", or the Central Firing School, on 12 January 1922, and organized into a company of twelve light tanks. In September 1921, the Spanish government also procured six Schneider CA1 tanks and deployed these to Morocco as early as 28 February 1922. On 13 March 1922, six FT-17s were unloaded at Melilla, as well.
On 18 March 1922, the company of FT-17 light tanks took part in its first combat operation, during the Rif War. Ordered to operate with the Spanish Legion, the force was to capture the town of Tunguntz, in Northern Morocco. Surprising the defenders with their appearance, the armored company and the legionnaires behind it captured to the town of Anvar. Advancing towards Tunguntz, the tanks began to come under heavy fire, as they had isolated themselves from the legionnaires due to the speed of their advance. As a result, the tanks were forced to withdraw to Anvar to fall back on the protection of the infantry. Two FT-17s were abandoned by their crew due to mechanical problems and were later destroyed by the Moroccan defenders with dynamite. A post-action analysis of the action decided that the poor performance of the tanks company had come from poor cooperation with the infantry, the lack of reliability of the tanks' machine guns and the lack of prior training before being rushed to the front. Thereafter, Spain's armored company was used almost continuously in small-scale operations between late 1922 and September 1925. On 8 September 1925, Spain's armor would take part in the first amphibious landing with tanks in history.
After being refitted with brand new FT-17s to replace losses incurred during the three years of operations in Morocco, the tank company was transferred to Ceuta to prepare for the amphibious operations planned to place in and around Al Hoceima Bay. In the days previous to the Alhucemas Landing, the armored company took part in a number of training exercises, while four K-type landing craft were modified to allow them to carry three tanks each. However, on the day of the landings the landing craft hit a shoal from the beach; as a result, the armored company was not able to land until the next day, on 9 September 1925. Upon landing, the vehicles were used to support the left flank of the Spanish attack and aided in the capture of the heights surrounding the beaches and controlling the exit points towards the inland.
The Rif War came to an end in May 1926, and the armored company was relocated to the Spanish mainland in July of that year.
Early indigenous tank development programs: 1925–1935.
With their experiences in Morocco, the Spanish Army decided to fund a development program for a new Spanish light tank. The new vehicle was to be based on the French FT-17, which was the most numerous armored vehicle in service with the Spanish Army at the time and one of the most widely used by foreign armies. The program was spearheaded by Captain of the Artillery Carlos Ruiz de Toledo, who had first commanded the battery of Schneider CA1 assault tanks in Morocco; Toledo felt that the tank would become an extremely important asset in future conflicts and felt that the Spanish Army required a Spanish-built model. As a result, he toured a number of European states in an effort to collect information on new trends in tank design and attempt to integrate these into the Spanish tank program. The resulting tank was known as the "Carro de Combate Trubia serie A", or the "Series A Trubia Tank".
Trubia light tank.
The first prototype development began in 1925. Produced in the Trubia Artillery Factory ("Fábrica de Artillería Trubia"), in Asturias, the tank was powered by a four cylinder Hispano-Suiza 40/50 engine, the same engine the Spanish Army's military trucks had been equipped with since 1915. Given the Spanish Army's opinion that the FT-17 was limited in firepower, the Trubia tank featured a special turret. The turret was designed in two articulated halves, which could traverse independently, each armed with a machine gun. Theoretically, if one of the machine guns jammed, the tank would still have another one to defend itself with. Furthermore, the vehicle's hull was provided with firing ports, to allow the crew to fire from within the tank. This prototype was put through a series of tests, and its success brought about the decision to continue development on a Spanish tank, leading to an improved Trubia tank design, known as the "Modelo Trubia 75HP, tipo rápido, serie A" (Model Trubia 75 hp, fast tank, series A).
While touring Europe for a second time, in an attempt to integrate foreign design trends into the new Trubia, Captain Ruiz de Toledo found a new type of track system in Germany. Designed to avoid having problems with the tracks coming off the vehicle, the new design substituted the traditional tracks with a system which was held together by a lateral metal wall, with the roadwheels suspended from the chassis. The track system was the most innovative and unique part of the new Trubia light tank. Apart from the new tracks, the Trubia was to have a greater velocity (at least ) and greater road range than the FT-17. While a new machine gun was installed on the glacis plate, the tank's crew was increased from two to three, which caused the hull to be enlarged; this also allowed the engine to be maintained from inside the vehicle, allowing the crew to fix small breakdowns in the field. To refrigerate the engine and the crew, a compressed air dispenser was installed inside the chassis. This solved problems dealing with the crew's claustrophobia and the intake of gasses originating from the engine found in the FT-17, and made crewing the tank much more ergonomic. The original was replaced with a more powerful Daimler four cylinder engine. The transmission had four forward gears and four reverse gears. The new tank proved satisfactory—and even bettered the French FT-17 in some aspects—and the Spanish Army ordered the construction of four prototypes.
The first prototype was manufactured in 1926. A total of four prototypes were ordered, but production was slow and by 1928 only one of the tanks had been completed, while the other three prototypes were not armed. The completed vehicle, called the Trubia A4, was sent to the Firing School where it was put through a series of tests. In 1931, a second prototype was completed, while the final two were completed in 1934. The original prototype was returned to the factory in 1935, to integrate a number of modernizations and to repair any damage which was done to the vehicle during the testing process. The other three tanks were issued to the Milan Infantry Regiment, in Oviedo, where they continued testing.
Other tank programs.
While the Trubia was being developed, the Spanish Army acquired an Italian Fiat 3000A. Ordered in October 1924, it was received in January 1925, and assigned to the Central Firing School. There, it went through a series of experiments and tests. The tank was originally developed as a near copy of the French FT-17, of which Italy had previously attempted to procure one hundred units. It had a smaller chassis and was powered through a engine. The FIAT 3000A had a turret with two machine guns; this was later improved with a cannon and designated the FIAT 3000B.
In 1928, the Trubia Factory, under Major of the Artillery Victor Landesa Domenech, designed and began production of a prototype of a new armored tractor; these were named after him, as the Landesa. The unarmed tractor finished production in 1930 and went through a series of tests. Between 1931 and 1932 the vehicle went through a series of upgrades in the factory and was later sent to Madrid for further testing, where it passed satisfactorily in April 1932. Landesa, who had at this time been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, began a preseries of three vehicles, motored by the L-2000 engine, designed by Daimler-Benz. Ultimately, two were produced and set for testing with the Spanish Republican Army, and another nine were ordered with the idea of using them to tow Škoda anti-aircraft cannons. All the while, the Trubia Factory began to plan an armored and armed version of the vehicle for the Spanish Army. Two were produced by 1934, although the Trubia Factory experienced troubles in producing the L-2000 engines; as a result, they were not powered by the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. They were armed with a single machine gun.
Tanks during the Spanish Civil War: 1936–1939.
At the start of the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish Army counted on a total of ten FT-17s in working condition distributed equally amongst two light tank regiments; one in Madrid and the other in Sevilla. The former (1st Light Tank Regiment) fell under the control of the Second Spanish Republic's army, while the 2nd Light Tank Regiment (in Zaragoza) was integrated into the Nationalist army. The lone Fiat 3000A is thought to have been in service at this time, but was cannibalized for parts. Spain's six Schneider CA1 assault tanks were put into service with the Republican Army, and saw combat around Madrid before and during the Siege of Madrid, and during the Siege of the Alcázar in Toledo. They were destroyed during the Siege of Madrid. The three Trubia A4 prototypes issued to the Milan Infantry Regiment were turned over to the Nationalist uprising, while the fourth prototype located in the Trubia Factory was taken by the factory's workers and quickly repaired so that it could be pressed into service in the Republican Army.
Armor of the Popular Front.
Spain's Republican Forces fabricated a number of different armored vehicles throughout the war. Although serving little military purpose, due to the poor quality of their design and construction, they were important factors in lifting the Popular Front's military's morale. Factories in the northern areas of Spain produced a fair number of armored tractors and trucks; for example, sixteen armored vehicles, denominated Naval-Somua, were manufactured based on the chassis of the French Somua bus. The Trubia Factory, at this time working for the Republic, manufactured between 15 and 20 light tanks known as the Trubia-Naval, which were heavily influenced by the Landesa and the Trubia A4. However, most construction revolved around the armoring of trucks, known as "Tiznaos" for the grey color of their steel armor. Due to the weight of the armor and the low power output of their engines, many were not able to move more than without breaking down. These were mostly constructed in the heavily industrialized regions in northern Spain and in Cataluña. The factories of Levante fabricated, under Soviet guidance, what was considered to be one of the best armored trucks of the war—the UNL-35. These vehicles were based on the Soviet ZiS-5 truck, and were fabricated between early 1937 and March 1939 at a rate of no more than five per month. Also, based on other chassis, such as Ford's model 817T, around 120 UNL-35s were manufactured.
On 15 October 1936, the first shipment of 50 Soviet T-26 light tanks arrived at Cartagena. These were put into combat as early as 26 October, under the leadership of Soviet Lieutenant Colonel Semyon Krivoshein, south of Madrid. The first combat operation in Spain for the T-26 was near the town of Seseña, when a Republican tank company counterattacked against the spearhead of the Nationalist's drive towards Madrid. The counterattack, although partially successful, did not hinder the Nationalist advance. By the beginning of the operation, the tanks had separated themselves from the infantry, following them. However, the Republican armor successfully surprised a company of Nationalist infantrymen, who had mistaken then for Italian allies, and routed them. The tank company then continued towards the town of Esquivias, to the West, where they were counterattacked by cavalry from the Moroccan Legion and finally forced to withdraw. Lacking infantry support, a number of T-26s were knocked out by Nationalist infantrymen using wine bottles as bomblets. The tank company returned through Seseña, which had been reoccupied by Nationalist infantry, and came under heavy fire. Despite the withdrawal, the counterattack was heavily publicized in Madrid, by the Republic, as a victory. The lack of success is attributed to the lack of coordination between Republican tanks, infantry and artillery. Although it's commonly mentioned that Spain received 312 T-26s, this number includes 16 FT-17s, delivered by Poland, and 15 T-26s which never actually made it to Spain. Ultimately, 281 T-26s were delivered to Spain during the Spanish Civil War.
The Soviet Union also supplied Spain with 50 BT-5 tanks. Although slightly heavier than the T-26, the BT-5 was faster; it was capable of reaching velocities of with tracks, on road, and with wheels. However, given the non-ideal nature of Spanish terrain, the BT-5 was rarely capable of taking advantage of its speed. The loss of many of the Republic's BT-5s during the Battle of the Ebro caused them to retire the tank to their reserves. The BT-5 was a product improvement of J. Walter Christie's fast tank concept, using Christie suspension, and was armed with a tank gun.
Organization of Popular Front armored forces.
The first 50 T-26 tanks which arrived in Spain, under the command of Krivoshein, were crewed by Soviet personnel. Nevertheless, the Soviet lieutenant colonel opened a training school in the town of Archena, near Cartagena, recruiting mainly truck and bus drivers from cities such as Madrid and Barcelona. The next month, he opened a second school in Alcalá de Henares, north of Madrid. However, only Communist soldiers were allowed to crew Soviet tanks, and as a result the pool of soldiers to recruit from was narrow and often less adept drivers were picked over better ones, due to their political ideologies. For example, in one instance a tank commander broke contact with the enemy because he had not learned how to fire his main gun. Furthermore, at first, the Soviet trainers did not have interpreters to communicate with their Spanish students.
With training underway, and the tanks quickly put into combat, the first 50 vehicles were organized into the Popular Army's first tank battalion. The battalion was equipped with three tank companies (each company containing ten tanks) and a headquarters company; each company had three platoons, with three tanks a piece, and a command tank. By mid-November a second battalion was organized. Later that month, Krivoshein and his deputy (Major Greisser) were recalled to the Soviet Union and replaced by General Dmitry Pavlov. In December 1936, General Pavlov organized new Soviet armored vehicles into an armored brigade, made up of four tank battalions and a reconnaissance company. This brigade, known as "Brigada de Carros de Combate" (Tank Brigade), was composed of 56 tanks and 68 other armored vehicles, and immediately saw combat around Madrid, including in the battles of Jarama and Guadalajara. However, the brigade was used to support Republican infantry forces and not as a mobile armored group, and as a result its strategic role during the war was limited by its misuse. In July 1937, the brigade took part in the Battle of Brunete, the largest tank battle to that date in the war, with some 150 Republican tanks taking part. The battle was also one of the few examples during the Spanish Civil War of the use of tanks to exploit a penetration along the front. However, the battle cost the Popular Army around 159 armored fighting vehicles.
After the Battle of Brunete, the brigade was reorganized into a new Spanish division, known as the "División de Ingenios Blindados" (Armored Vehicles Division). This was composed of a tank brigade and an armored brigade; the latter was made up of lighter armored fighting vehicles, such as the BA-6. It was put under the command of Spanish Colonel Sánchez Paredes. By this time, most of the Soviet tankers had returned to the Soviet Union to provide information on mechanized warfare in Spain. The only Soviet unit left was the heavy tank regiment, armed with brand new BT-5s which had not been used in combat yet. This regiment was crewed by both Soviet and veteran Spanish tankers, and was put under the command of Soviet Colonel Kondriatev. Finally, the division also disposed of an infantry brigade and an anti-tank artillery company. However, by this time the Republican military command had relegated the tank to the role of merely infantry support, dissuaded by the poor performance of Republican armor to that date. The last major battle Republican armor would take part in was the Battle of the Ebro, in 1938.
The Soviets deduced that although tank formations in Spain were not large enough to perform an ideal mechanized penetration of an enemy's lines, too large tank formations were also not ideal due to uneven terrain preventing their use en masse. As a result, armored commanders like Pavlov considered the tank's best role to be infantry support. The Republican use of armor during the Spanish Civil War was not a good demonstration of deep mechanized battle.
Armor of the Nationalists.
During the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalist Army only developed a single tank, the "Carro de Infanteria modelo 1937" (Infantry Tank model 1937). Taking advantage of the capture of the Trubia Factory in the north, in 1937, the Nationalists based it on the Republican Trubia-Naval, the German Panzer I, the T-26 and the Italian CV-33. It was designed to unite the best of all three major light tanks used by the Nationalist Army during the war. However, it did not perform as well as expected, and it was not put into mass production. The Nationalist Army did manufacture a small number of armored trucks and tractors, as well as beginning the development of the Verdeja light tank, but none of these contributed with distinction to the Nationalist effort against the Popular Army.
The first foreign tanks to enter service with the Nationalists were five Italian CV-33s, which arrived at the city of Vigo on 26 August 1936. These arrived with ten crewman, whom would serve as instructors. The tanks were armed with two machine guns and had a maximum of of steel armor. On 10 December 1936, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini decided to send combat troops to Spain, in a bid to end the war as early as possible. These men were organized into the "Corpo Truppe Volontarie" (CTV; Volunteer Corps), and by the end of the year their ranks had swelled to an estimated 47,000 men; 20,000 of which came from the Italian Army, and 27,000 of which originated from the Blackshirts. The corps was put under the command of Italian General Mario Roatta. The first major battle for the CTV came in March 1938, when it decided to engage Republican forces during the Battle of Guadalajara. A force of some 35,000 men, including 81 tanks, attacked on 8 March 1937. Failing to take into account the meteorological conditions of the battlefield, by the following day the Italian troops found themselves attacking over ground that had turned into mud due to the heavy rains. The slow speed of the advance allowed the Republican Air Force to persistently raid advancing Italian forces, dispersing entire columns off the main roads and forcing them to stall in the mud. A Republican counterattack on 18 March, led by Pavlov's armored brigade, forced the Italians to withdraw. Nationalist air support failed to provide close air support for Italian troops because runways had become water-logged, while Italian armor proved no match against the heavier and faster T-26 and BT-5 tanks. Officially, the Italians lost an estimated 2,700 soldiers during the campaigning around Guadalajara; the Republican Army lost an estimated 4,000. According to other sources, the CTV lost an estimated 5,000 casualties during the battle. However, armor losses were relatively low, as the Republicans lost 7 T-26s and the Italians lost 19 CV-33s. Despite this initial setback, the Italian government continued the supply of personnel and equipment to the CTV in Spain, and by late 1938 the Italian volunteer's corps was equipped with three tank battalions. By the end of the war, a total of 155 CV-33s were delivered to Spain.
The Germans delivered a total of 122 Panzer I light tanks to the Spanish Army over the course of the war. The first shipment arrived in October 1936, consisting of 41 tanks. These tanks would see combat as early as 30 October, around Madrid, when they engaged a column of Republican armored cars, which were able to knock out the German tanks at ranges of , with their larger guns. Although the use of armor penetrating ammunition fired from the Panzer I's machine guns could penetrate the armor of the T-26 at ranges of up to , Republican tankers simply began to engage from ranges of up to , using their heavier tank guns. Furthermore, the sights on the T-26 were calibrated for ranges far longer than those calibrated on German equipment. This disadvantage in firepower led the Nationalist Army to experiment with the adoption of the Italian Breda anti-aircraft gun for its fleet of Panzer Is. Firing a perforating projectile, this cannon could penetrate up to of steel armor at a range of . The installation of the gun required the top of the tank's turret to be cut off and extended upwards, increasing the vehicle's profile and decreasing the visibility of the crew. Furthermore, the new gun's sights were located within an open crease to the front of the new turret extension, forcing the gunner to aim and fire from a relatively unsafe position. Although originally the Nationalists were aiming to equip at least one Panzer I in each platoon of each battalion with the larger gun, only four prototypes were completed. The capture of Republican T-26s and their return to service with the Nationalist Army made the modification of the Panzer I unnecessary, while later attempts to up-gun the German light tank failed because of the lack of available Breda guns. There were also attempts to mount a anti-tank gun and a tank gun, taken from a captured Soviet vehicle, but these failed before any prototypes were completed.
The Nationalist's tank disparity with Republican forces caused Nationalist commanders to offer Spanish soldiers up to 500 pesetas for each captured T-26. Due to the number of T-26s captured and put back into service against their previous masters, the Soviet Union also inadvertently became the largest provider of armored fighting vehicles of the Nationalist Army. An estimated total of 178 T-26s were captured during the Spanish Civil War, including 98 put back into service, 30 irreparable vehicles used for spare parts, and 50 T-26s not pressed into service with the Nationalist Army. In May 1939, France turned over 10 T-26s, which had been interned after they had retreated across the border, to Nationalist Spain. The number of captured BT-5s amounted to much less. By May 1938, the Nationalist tank force had only put into service 4 BT-5s, as opposed to 39 T-26s. The first Nationalist tank company outfitted with T-26s entered combat during the Battle of Brunete, between 18–23 July 1937. Ultimately, the amount of captured equipment caused the Nationalists to organize a recuperation unit, designed to recuperate Soviet armor off the field and repair them so that they could return to combat.
Post-war era: 1939–1953.
At the end of the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish Army could count on 144 Panzer Is and CV-33s, and 139 T-26s. Panzer Is and CV-33s were organized as "light tanks", denominated Type Is, while the T-26s were considered "medium" tanks and categorized as Type IIs. These were organized into four armored regiments, including the 1st Tank Regiment (based in Madrid), the 2nd Tank Regiment (in Sevilla) and the 3rd and 4th Tank Regiments. The 3rd's organization was based upon that used by Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War, while the 4th's was based on that used by the Italian CTV. In 1941, a fifth regiment was created in North Africa.
Verdeja tank program.
Between late 1937 and 1938, Captain Félix Verdeja Bardales began to privately develop the concept for a new light tank. The new tank would take into consideration all the qualities and problems with existing tanks in service with the Nationalist Army, including the Panzer I and T-26, and combine a number of characteristics which would make it the best light tank in service at the time. His ideal light tank included a tank gun, with 360-degree traverse and an elevation of 72 degrees. At the same time, the vehicle was to have the lowest possible silhouette, and no less than of all-around armor, and on the front. Furthermore, the armor was to be sloped to maximize its efficiency and chance of an incoming projectile ricocheting. With a maximum velocity of , the light tank was to be powered by a engine. Furthermore, the vehicle's mechanical reliability was to improve upon that of the existing tanks in service with the Nationalist Army. Despite initial obstacles, including opposition to an indigenous Spanish tank program from German General Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma, the first prototype was delivered in late 1938; this prototype was built from spare parts taken from a number of different tanks. The prototype performed well in testing and a new prototype was ordered.
The new prototype was much closer to what Captain Verdeja had originally planned. The chassis was enlarged, and the engine was moved to the left side of the front compartment of the hull. The volume of the fuel tanks and the thickness of the armor was also increased, while the height of the turret was decreased by sloping the turret's sides. One of the most unusual - at the time - developments for the tank were the tracks, designed to eliminate the possibility of having them slide off when the tank was moving. The tank had a sprocket to the front of the hull, on each side, and a tensioner to the rear. The tracks were guided by four return rollers and four roadwheels. The tracks had previously been tested on the original prototype; they were designed to fit around the roadwheel, and consequently lock themselves into place, avoiding the possibility of slipping off. The construction of the prototype was postponed until May 1940, due to a shortage of funds, and the tank was finally delivered to the proving grounds of Carabanchel for testing. The prototype was denominated the Verdeja 1, and competed against a T-26B in a number of different tests. Ultimately, the Verdeja scored a total of 243 points, as compared to 205 scored by the T-26. The testing resulted in a number of modifications, including higher suspension to allow climbing over taller obstacles, the increase in armor thickness, increase of the body width and the creation of an empty space at the rear, to allow for the future installation of a communications radio. After two months work, the Verdeja 1 was returned for testing and this time scored a total of 261.98 points. Although the success of this prototype persuaded the Spanish government to issue an order for the construction of 1,000 tanks, ultimately lack of incentives to develop the relevant industrial infrastructure; the poor economic situation after the Spanish Civil War and absence of foreign clients, soon caused the production program to collapse.
As the Verdeja 1 program dissolved, Captain Verdeja began to design a successor, taking into consideration the lessons learned during the opening campaigns of the Second World War. The new design featured a reorganized engine bay at the rear of the chassis, which meant moving the drive sprocket to the rear as well. The movement of the engine's location allowed for better cooling of the vehicle's motor and the fighting compartment, as well as allowing the turret to be moved forward. The vehicle's armor was also increased substantially. This new tank was not approved for production or further development, due to continued postponement of the production of the Verdeja 1 for reasons which included offers by the German government to supply the Panzer IV's engine for the Verdeja 1. Although production of the new vehicle finally began in 1942, it was not until August 1944 that the Verdeja 2 prototype was delivered. The decision to purchase a number of German armored vehicles delayed the decision to begin production of the Verdeja 2; ultimately the vehicle was left untouched until 1950, when there was a failed attempt to mount a new engine.
Beginning in 1945, the now-Major Verdeja was ordered to begin designing an artillery piece using a rapid-firing 75 millimeter L/40 howitzer designed by "Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval", based on the Verdeja 1 chassis. The chassis' roof and rear wall were eliminated, and instead a gun shield placed over the front. A mechanical brake was installed next to the idler wheel, stopping rearwards movement of the artillery piece during the firing process. The availability of the required parts and the lack of complicated changes meant that the vehicle was quickly prepared and tested extensively. The fate of the self-propelled piece was much the same as that of the Verdeja 2, and the vehicle was left untouched at the proving grounds in Carabanchel until 1973, when it was moved to the Spanish base "Alfonso XIII", housing the then Mechanized Infantry Regiment "Wad Rass nº 55". It was soon moved to another base, and finally delivered to the base of "El Goloso", outside of Madrid, as a part of an armored vehicles museum.
German armor in service with the Spanish Army.
In 1943, the Spanish Army and government decided to replace much of its armor. Tanks such as the Panzer I and T-26 were obsolete, as compared to newer tanks such as the Soviet T-34 and German Panther tank. As a result, on 15 March 1943 Spain began to negotiate with the Wehrmacht over the acquisition of up to date materiel. The petition asked for 250 Panzer IIIs and 100 Panzer IVs. In return, the Germans instead offered a sale of 20 Panzer IVs and 10 Sturmgeschütz IIIs. On 29 April, Spain accepted Germany's offer. The Panzer IVs sold were of the "Ausf." H variant, and arrived in Spain on 6 December 1943. The Panzer IV "Ausf." H included the longer tank gun, and the homogeneous steel plate on the glacis. As early as January 1944, Spain again began to negotiate with Germany for more equipment. The new program revolved around the sale of 33 Panzer IVs, three of which would be of the command variant. Another offer was made for 67 more Panzer IVs at a later date; a result, the two programs together summed up to a potential procurement of 100 Panzer IVs. Spain also suggested the purchase of a number of Tiger tanks, although this offer never amounted to anything serious. Regardless, the program to acquire another 100 Panzer IVs never materialized. The 20 Panzer IVs received in late 1943 were organized into two companies, distributed among two battalions in the armored regiment of the Brunete Armored Division.
At the end of World War II, the Spanish Army counted on a tank force composed of 20 Panzer IVs, 10 StuG IIIs, 116 T-26s, 93 Panzer Is (including command vehicles), 60 CV-33s and 80 armored cars. In 1949 the armored regiment was reorganized into two battalions of 60 T-26s, with two command Panzer Is, six combat versions of the Panzer I and two CV-33, which were used for reconnaissance, each. A third battalion was composed of the 20 Panzer IVs, plus six Panzer Is. The regiment numbered an estimated 1,500 personnel and 100 tanks.
American military aid: 1954–1970.
By the mid-1950s, the state of the Spanish Army's tanks was deteriorating. Spain's armored force composition remained the same until February 1954, when the United States delivered the first twelve M47 Patton tanks to the Spanish Army. These were a product of a military aid program the United States had signed with Spain in 1953. By 1957, the Spanish Army had received a total of 29 M47 tanks. Over the course of the 1950s, Spain received a total of 389 M47 Patton tanks. Throughout the 1960s, Spain received 65 M48 Patton tanks and 66 M48A1s. The M47 and M48 tanks were an important modernization of Spain's armored firepower. For example, while the T-26 was armed with a cannon, the American tanks were armed with the much more powerful tank gun. While a Panzer IV's ("Ausf." G) L/43 tank gun could penetrate of steel armor at (using the "Panzergranate" 39), the M47 (using the M348 HEAT warhead) could penetrate from its tank gun. Furthermore, the M47's armor was thick on the glacis plate, and thick on the turret front. Spain also received a number of M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks. These were organized into the "Villaviciosa" Light Armored Cavalry Regiment, while four were also organized into the "Alcázar de Toledo" Armored Infantry Regiment as reconnaissance tanks.
Between 1953 and 1968, the Spanish Army received a total of 446 medium battle tanks (M47s and M48s), 123 light tanks (M24s and M41s), as well as 30 armored recovery vehicles (the M74). In 1970, the United States agreed to extend the military aid program by another five years, giving Spain another 66 M48A2 tanks and 17 M41A3s.
The vehicles received were organized based on a reorganization of the "Brunete" Armored Division in 1965. This included the General Staff, based at El Pardo, and the "Nucleo de Tropas Divisionario" (Divisionary Troop Nucleus). The latter was formed by the "Villaviciosa" Light Armored Cavalry Regiment, the Campaign Artillery Regiment, the 1st Anti-Air Artillery Group, the 1st Engineering Regiment and the Divisionary Logistics Group. Also in the division was the XI Mechanized Infantry Brigade, which included the 6th "Saboya" Motorized Infantry Regiment, the 55th "Uad Ras" Mechanized Infantry Regiment, the XI Self-Propelled Artillery Group, the XI Engineering Battalion and the XI Logistics Group. Finally, the division also made use of the XII Armored Brigade, which was formed by the 61st "Alcázar de Toledo" Armored Infantry Regiment, the 31st "Asturias" Mechanized Infantry Regiment, the XII Self-Propelled Artillery Group, the XII Engineering Battalion and the XII Logistics Group. The majority of the division's armor was located in the "Alcázar de Toledo" Armored Infantry Regiment, which contained two regiments of 48 M48s and 54 M47s, respectively.
Late Cold War: 1970–1991.
The United States' ban on the usage of American ordnance supplied as military aid to Spain during the 1957–58 Ifni War pushed Spain to look for alternative equipment which could be freely employed in the Spanish Sahara. Throughout the 1960s, the Spanish government had approached the governments of France and West Germany, hoping to procure either the AMX-30 or the Leopard 1, respectively. Ultimately, the Germans were unable to sell the Leopard tank on account of the gun system being British; at the time, the British Labour Party had decided not to sell to the government of Francisco Franco in Spain. As a result, in May 1970 Spain and France agreed to the sale of 19 AMX-30 main battle tanks. The first six AMX-30s were delivered in November 1970, and these were immediately issued to a new armoured company of the Spanish Legion, stationed in Spanish Sahara. All 19 AMX-30s purchased from France in 1970 were delivered to the Spanish Legion, in the Spanish Sahara. Beginning in 1974, Spain began to manufacture the AMX-30 (now denominated the AMX-30E), with production of the first batch of 180 tanks ending on 25 June 1979. The second batch, this time of 100 AMX-30Es, were produced between 1979 and 1983. This gave the Spanish Army a total of 299 AMX-30Es.
The AMX-30E was armed with the modele F1 tank gun, and was powered by the HS-110 diesel engine. With a fuel tank of , the tank had a road range of and the fuel was, on average, sufficient for 18 hours of travel. The tracks had a life of at least . However, Spain's new tanks began to suffer a number of mechanical problems, dealing with the reliability of the original engine and transmission. Therefore, the Spanish Army and Santa Bárbara Sistemas (the vehicle's manufacturer in Spain) began to look into a series of modifications to improve the AMX-30. By this time, the Spanish Army had already begun upgrading its M47 and M48 Patton tanks to the M47E and M48E models, which made them equivalent to the M60 Patton tank in capabilities.
While the army was studying a possible modernisation of its brand-new AMX-30E fleet, the Spanish Ministry of Defense had set aside 120 billion "pesetas" (1.1 billion dollars) for a future tank programme and attracted interest from five foreign companies. A bid by Krauss-Maffei's, known as the Lince, provided the clearest technical designs. The tank would be and equipped with a 120-millimeter main gun. It could fire this gun on the move and aim at targets with effectiveness in day and night operations. Fitted with a 1,200 horsepower (894.84 kW) engine, the Lince could travel as fast as 70 kilometers per hour (43.50 mph) on the roads. Although heavily based on the Leopard 2A4, the Lince was smaller and lighter, trading protection for mobility. Specifically, the Lince prioritised enhanced mobility over the irregular Spanish terrain. Furthermore, size restrictions were imposed due to the existing capabilities of Spain's railroad and highway network. Although the reduced armor conflicted with the problems that the Spanish had with AMX-30E's thin armour, the Lince used a multi-layer armor similar to that of the German Leopard 2A4, providing greater protection than standard armour for a similar weight. The protection was further enhanced by the low profile turret, again similar to that of the Leopard 2A4. Despite the offer and ongoing collaboration with the Italians, Spanish investment in the German-Spanish Lince programme grew up to 200 billion pesetas (1.8 billion dollars). However, the Spanish government did not announce any winner for the contract. This indecision led Krauss-Maffei to freeze their bid for the Lince. Krauss-Maffei also cited the loss of millions of dollars due to failures on part of Santa Bárbara Sistemas, who would manufacture the Lince. In 1987, the Lince program was pushed aside and postponed by the Spanish Ministry of Defense's decision to instead go on with the modernisation of the Spanish Army's AMX-30E fleet. Ultimately, the purchase of a number of M60 Patton tanks, the modernisation of the AMX-30E and the continued fiscal problems finally caused the Spanish Ministry of Defense to cancel the Lince programme in 1989.
Between 1989 and 1993, 150 AMX-30Es were modernised to what would become known as the AMX-30EM2. The modernisation entailed the introduction of a new armour piercing discarding sabot round, the modification of the turret hatch to allow the installation of a larger anti-aircraft machine gun, and a brand new fire control system. Besides these modernisations of the tank's firepower, the mobility of the tank was improved through the exchange of the old engine and transmission for the more reliable MTU 833 Ka-501 diesel engine, producing , coupled with the German German ZF LSG-3000. A new smoke machine, linked to the tank's new engine, was also installed. The other 149 AMX-30Es went through a less expensive and extensive modification, known as the AMX-30EM1. These received the American Allison CD-850-6A three speed transmission (two forward and one reverse); however, the new transmission caused extensive overheating in the engine compartment. These 149 AMX-30EM1s would eventually be replaced by M60 Patton tanks, purchased from the United States, in the early 1990s.
Modern Spanish armor: 1992–present.
In the early 1990s, the Spanish Army received 244 M60 tanks to replace its aging fleet of M47Es and M48Es, and its troublesome AMX-30EM1s. However, these did not represent a great improvement over the existing fleet, and as a result as early as 1994 the Spanish government had already begun to negotiate for a future Spanish tank, which would replace the M60. Although the Germans offered Spain surplus Leopard 1 tanks and Soviet equipment incorporated into the German Army after the reunification of Germany, the Spanish government declined these offers and pressed for the Leopard 2. In March 1994, the Spanish Ministry of Defense created "Programa Coraza 2000" (Programme Armour 2000), which focused on the procurement and integration of new armament for the Spanish Army's modernisation. The program included the procurement and integration of a Spanish derivative of the German Leopard 2, known as the Leopard 2E into the Spanish Army. The programme's scope extended to the integration of 108 Leopard 2A4s, which were leased to Spain in late 1995. Apart from procurement, "Programa Coraza" was meant to prepare the Spanish Army logistically for the introduction of new matériel.
A memorandum of understanding was signed on 1995 between the German and Spanish governments, setting the foundations for an acquisition of up to 308 brand-new Leopard 2Es. These were to be assembled in Spain by Santa Bárbara Sistemas, with 60–70 percent of the components manufactured by Spanish companies, and production taking place between 1998 and 2003. Furthermore, the German government agreed to lend the Spanish Army 108 for training purposes for a period of five years. These vehicles were delivered between November 1995 and June 1996. In 1998, Spain agreed to procure the ceded and reduce production of the brand-new Leopard 2E to 219 vehicles. In 2005 it was declared that the 108 Leopard 2A4s were to cost Spain 16.9 million euros, to be paid by 2016. The Leopard 2Es, based on the German Leopard 2A6, were produced between 2003 and 2008.
While the M60s were replaced by the Leopard 2s, the AMX-30EM2s were replaced by the Italian B1 Centauro anti-tank vehicle in the early years of the 2000s (decade).

Count of Tentúgal

Count of Tentúgal (in Portuguese "Conde de Tentúgal") was a Portuguese title of nobility created by a royal decree, dated from 1 January 1504, by King Manuel I of Portugal, and granted to "Dom" Rodrigo de Melo, son of Álvaro of Braganza and Philippa of Melo (daughter and heir of the Count of Olivença).
Twenty nine years later, in 1533, King John III of Portugal granted him the new title of Marquis of Ferreira (in Portuguese "Marquês de Ferreira"). Count of Tentúgal became the title used by the Marquis's heir.
Finally, and following the expel of the Philippine Dynasty from the throne of Portugal (1640), the new King John IV of Portugal granted to 5th Count of Tentúgal and 4th Marquis of Ferreira, Dom Nuno Álvares Pereira de Melo, the new title of Duke of Cadaval (in Portuguese "Duque de Cadaval") by a royal decree dated from 26 April 1648.
Marquis of Ferreira and Count of Tentúgal became subsidiary titles from the Duke of Cadaval, used by the Duke's heir, during his father's life.

The Instituto de Física Corpuscular (IFIC, English: "Institute for Corpuscular Physics") is a CSIC and University of Valencia joint center dedicated to experimental and theoretical research in the fields of particle physics, nuclear physics, cosmology, astroparticles and medical physics.
It is located at the scientific park of the University of Valencia, in Paterna (Valencia, Spain).
History.
In the autumn of 1950 Prof. Joaquin Catalá formed a group in Valencia to study atomic nuclei and elementary particles using nuclear emulsions. 
He had first been working in Bristol with C.F. Powell,
who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1950 for using this technique to detect
particles in cosmic rays.
Prof. Catalá’s group first operated as a Local Division of the Instituto de Óptica Daza de Valdés 
belonging to CSIC and specialized in photo-nuclear studies. One of Catalá’s students, Fernando Senent, later becoming Professor and director of the Institute, produced what was the first Spanish thesis in Experimental Particle and Nuclear Physics. It was at the beginning of 1960 when the Institute got its present name, IFIC, Instituto de Física Corpuscular. IFIC, hence, is one of the oldest Spanish Institutes in Experimental Physics and the oldest studying particle and nuclear physics.

Taoism in Japan

Taoism is believed to be the inspiration for spiritual concepts in Japanese culture. Taoism is similar to Shinto in that it also started as an indigenous religion in China, although it is more hermetic than shamanistic. Taoism's influence can be seen throughout the culture but to a lesser extent than "jukyō".
Taoism in the form it takes in Japan can be easily seen as superstitious or astrological and the concept of demons and spirits seem to have their roots in a Taoist influence such as Onmyōdō and Shugendō. The widely practiced ritual of "setsubun" (節分) where chanters repeat "Demons out! Luck in!" has its base in Taoism and also touches on a relation to "uchi-soto". There is a culture of consultation where "ogamiyasan" are called upon to provide their Taoism based insight to bear upon events such as house-buildings. Taoism has a calendar whereby one can determine the best day, element and time should be chosen to color an event in the right light (Tengenjutsu (fortune telling)).
Etymology.
The Japanese "kanji" for Taoism is 道教 (Dô-kyô). The root of this "kanji" is 道 ("michi", way, path) + 教 ("kyō", doctrine, teaching, education). "Dô" shares the same Chinese character as "tao", 道 which literally means "way".
Taoism in Japan.
According to a tale from the "Nihon Shoki", a man named Tajima Mori set out to explore for the elixir of immortality and reached the Eternal Land, where he brought back the “fragrant fruit” to offer to his ruler; the latter turned out to be already dead so Tajima Mori followed suit. “Scholars have identified it as the immortals’ isles of "Penglai", and the ‘fragrant fruit’ as the mandarin orange”. The first proof of presence of Taoism in Japan was in the Edo period, through literary works of Chinese scholars. These were texts bearing Daoism longevity and immortality methods such as acupuncture, pharmacology and moxibustion and not religious scriptures. 
The legal system of China was brought to Japan in the late 7th and early 8th centuries, specifically a Bureau of "yin" and "yang", the "Ommyokan", to handle affairs of time keeping, astronomy, dream interpretation and calendar calculation and "yin-yang" and the Five Phases cosmology. By the 10th century, it developed with rituals to cast away unlucky tendencies and this became known as the religious practice in Japan called "inyodo" or "yin-yang" divination. 
Taoism also influenced "Shugendo", Japan’s shamanistic and mountain worship. It began in the 7th century and combined Buddhism, "yin-yang" divination, Shinto and Taoist elements. One spell of Taoistic influence is the “Come down, soldiers and fighters, and line up before me!” which is used to enter a holy mountain on certain days. Another ritual formula evident of Taoism is the “Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statues and ordinances!” which can be seen in banners, talismans and roof tiles even today in Japan. 
Daoism influences made its way even to Shinto, specifically Ise and Yoshida Shintō, both of which developed in Kamakura in 1281. Shinto became one of Japan’s political doctrines in the early 20th century, known as the State Shinto. In 1950, the Society for the Research of Daoism was founded. In 1951, the Society published its first journal. 
One of the Taoist practices in Japan is the "Kōshin" religion. "Koshin" refers to the 57th day of the 60-day calendar cycle, where three worms bringing death from the human body go to report of people’s sins in heaven. The worms then go back to the human body and shorten the people’s lifespan by causing illnesses and unhappiness. To avoid this, the Taoists stays awake the whole day and night and perform rituals. “The Koshin cult is the most obvious and best known instance of Taoism in Japan”

Critical reception.
Thom Jurek of Allmusic described the song favorably, calling it "a mid-tempo honky tonker with killer fiddle, telecasters chopping up the middle, and lyrics that make its sentimental subject matter palatable." Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song a B+ grade, calling it "so catchy, so charming, and so full of little funny details." He goes on to say that he forgives Jackson for "ripping off 'Two Sparrows in a Hurricane' so blatantly."
Music video.
The music video was directed by Piers Plowden and premiered in mid-1994.
Chart positions.
"Livin' on Love" debuted on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of September 3, 1994.

Corts Valencianes

The Corts Valencianes () are the main legislative body of the Generalitat Valenciana and therefore of the Valencian Community. The main location of the Corts is in the Palace of Benicarló in Valencia; however it can meet at any location in Valencian territory. The Corts has its origins in bodies established in the thirteenth century by King James I of Aragon. The modern institution was established in 1982 under the Valencian statute of autonomy of 1982. The current Corts were elected in 2011, with the People's Party increasing their overall majority.
History.
Following the conquest and reign of James I of Aragon, the economic and military needs of the Crown of Aragon justified some meetings of the king with representatives of the three social classes (the nobility, who controlled the military forces, the church and the middle class), to obtain military or financial services. The economic needs justified those meetings, and at the beginning of the sixteenth century, a stable institution called the Corts Valencianes had already been established. 
Among the meetings which were held during the reign of James I, the most important was that of 7 April 1261 in Valencia, during which the king promulgated the Furs of Valencia, a series of charters equivalent to a modern constitution. Proof of the economic importance of the corts for the crown is that the king promulgated the "Furs" in exchange for the sum of 48,000, which were paid to him by the city of Valencia, by the cities of the Horta de Valencia which belonged to the clergy and to the nobility, and by the towns of Castellon, Vilafamés, Onda, Llíria, Corberà, Cullera and Gandia.
At the time of those corts, King James established a rule for his successors obliging them to organise a general cort in Valencia at the beginning of each reign, in the first month after their entry into the city. This obligation was renewed during the corts of 1271, the corts were summoned by James I and later by his son Peter III of Aragon. Those Corts were the only obligatory meetings, but the king summoned the corts on other occasions when required. 
In 1302, James II decided that it was necessary to summon the corts every three years. Later, during the corts of 1336, Peter IV confirmed this triennial meeting, by specifying that the corts were to meet every three years on All Saints' Day. 
During the thirteenth century and at the beginning of the fourteenth, the representations of the other cities in the Kingdom of Valencia were gradually added, until the corts of 1239, during which the representations of various territories met, already constituting the corts of all the Kingdom. 
From that moment, the most important cities always met, while others attended depending on the relevance to them of the subjects being discussed. However, the representation was generally important. For example in the corts of Valencia of 1510, the following towns were represented: Ademús, Alacant, Alcoi, Alpuente, Alzira, Biar, Bocairent, Borriana, Cabdet, Castellon, Castielfabib, Cullera, Llíria, Morella, Ontinyent, Orihuela, Penàguila, Peníscola, Valencia, Villajoiosa, Villarreal, Xàtiva, Xèrica and Xijona. Half of the assemblies took place in Valencia cathedral.
The Valencian Corts of 1418, fixed the duration of the corts at three years. In the middle of the fifteenth century, the Valencian institutions were definitively established. 
With the unification of the crowns of Castille and Aragon, the Valencian corts declined in importance and were less frequently convened during the sixteenth century, a trend that continued in the seventeenth century. The last corts met in Valencia in 1645. Finally, after the War of the Spanish Succession and the new decree of 1707, the Kingdom of Valencia and its local rights were abolished. 
The Corts Valencianes were not convened again until their reestablishment under the Statute of Autonomy of 1982. As of the coming into effect of the Statute of Autonomy, the Corts have operated like a modern representative legislature. Although usually meeting in the provincial capital of Valencia city, they have met in various towns around the Valencian community in recent years, an initiative which has been developed by the most recent legislatures.
Modern legislatures.
The first legislature in modern times was elected in May 1983. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) won an absolute majority of votes and seats, with 51 of the 89 seats. However they lost their majority in 1987 and were forced to govern in coalition with the smaller United Left party. They won the 1991 elections with a majority of one seat, winning 45 seats in total. However in the 1995 elections there was a swing to the right with the Partido Popular (PP) becoming the largest party with 42 seats and governing in coalition with the smaller Unio Valenciana. This lasted until the elections of 1999 when the PP won an absolute majority with 49 seats. Although they lost a seat in 2003, they strengthened their position in the elections of 2007 and 2011, winning a record 55 seats.
Organisation, rules and composition.
Following the passing of the statute of autonomy of the Valencian Community, which established local government for the region, the Corts became the regional assembly, elected every four years by universal adult suffrage.
The name originated in the historic Valencian Corts, however previous bodies of that name had different functions representing three institutions: the clergy, the military/nobility and the royal family.
The Statute of Autonomy primarily defines the Corts Valencianes in chapter II, title II, although there are also references in other articles. The Statute simply indicates the composition of Corts, its functions, the basic principles of the electoral system, and traces the general framework of the Statute of the Deputies. Laws which develop the Statute, the rules of the Corts Valencianes regulate the organization and the operation of the Corts. The first rules were adopted during the transition stage. Since that moment, the rules have been modified on various occasions; the current drafting was ratified on 30 June 1994. 
The 1982 Statute of Autonomy states that the Corts will have a number of deputies ranging from 75 to 100. The current electoral law fixes the number at 99 deputies, divided according to the provinces and the electoral constituencies. Currently in the legislature 35 deputies are elected for the Province of Alicante, 24 deputies for the Province of Castellón and 40 deputies for the Province of Valencia. The Statute of Autonomy also states that to be elected, candidates must belong to a list which obtains at least 5% of the total number of votes. Certain political parties and alliances who fail to achieve that threshold, cannot enter the Parliament. For lists which cross the 5% barrier, the distribution of seats is done according to the D'Hondt method.

Public Health Advisor

The Public Health Advisor, or “PHA” is a type of public health worker which was established in 1948 by the United States Public Health Service in the Venereal Disease Control Division. Today they are hired primarily by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and serve in many public health programs. This type of worker is unique in public health, because they begin their service at the entry level of public health doing what is known as “field work” or “contact epidemiology” which refers to the interviewing and locating of people who have been exposed to an infectious disease so as to offer them treatment and to reduce the epidemic. Following their initial work experiences, PHAs are exposed to a variety of public health programs across the United States, learning to function at all levels of the public health system. During their time of service, PHAs are called upon to respond to public health or humanitarian crisis. This article will briefly describe the history of the Public Health Advisor and will mention a few notable contributions made over the course of their history with the Public Health Service and later with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
History and Purpose.
The United States Public Health Service has historically placed personnel in local areas to assist with disease outbreaks or to advise various public health programs. Medical officers and other personnel such as environmental health officers, nurses or in some cases technical workers like laboratorians would be sent to local and state health departments for temporary assignments. Though the Public Health Advisor is an example of this type of locally placed personnel, it was not until the 1940s that the U.S. federal government placed public health workers to do anything more than advise or assist local public health efforts.
The purpose of the Public Health Advisor, or “PHA,” was to help implement venereal disease “VD” programs (as they were known at the time, now known as STDs for sexually transmitted disease) because the job of controlling VD was not entirely effective. For example, in 1935 U.S. health surveys indicated that at any one time, 683,000 persons were under treatment and observation for syphilis. This same year saw 518,000 new infections, 100,000 of them among persons under twenty years of age. By the end of World War II, it was estimated that one in ten persons would have syphilis in their lifetime. The disease was devastating if untreated, causing more than fifteen percent of all blindness, fifty percent of perinatal blindness, and eighteen percent of deaths from heart disease. In the late 1930s, 60,000 children were born each year with congenital syphilis. Following both World Wars (I and II), syphilis was seeded in the population because the public health infrastructure was not funded well enough to respond to cases of the disease. Physicians were not consistently reporting to the local health authorities when patients were diagnosed with syphilis, and (more importantly), the sexual partners of patients were not being identified or contacted so that they too might be offered curative treatment for syphilis. As such, syphilis was prevalent in the U.S. population, such that the federal government opted to initiate help to local venereal disease programs in states and local areas.
The kind of help needed was more than advice to programs. Advisors had been provided to the state and local public health departments during the 1940s; however, cases of syphilis remained. What was needed was help with the patients themselves – a task called contact epidemiology which involved interviewing people who were newly diagnosed with syphilis, identifying their sexual partners, and then going out into the community to locate these partners and bringing them into the clinic or to their physicians for examination and, if necessary, treatment. This job was the job of the venereal disease investigator; a job that was being done in some of the local areas, but neither uniformly nor effectively.
To meet the need for VD investigators, the VD Division of the U.S. Public Health Service hired a small group of college graduates to work as VD investigators for the federal government. These initial recruits were assigned to work on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.
Contributions of Public Health Advisors.
After their introduction in 1948, the Public Health Advisor became an important part of the public health infrastructure of local and state health departments. In 1957 when the Public Health Service transferred the Venereal Disease Division to the Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta (which later became the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), PHAs were quickly recognized as an asset to other public health efforts because they were trained in phlebotomy (drawing of blood through venipuncture), they knew how to organize mass testing and could investigate diseases, and they could manage public health programs.
Public Health Advisors were soon called upon by the CDC to help with polio efforts in 1961, they built the national Immunization Program following the passage of the Vaccine Assistance Act of 1962, they were soon recruited to work in the Tuberculosis Program, and by 1992 could be found in virtually all of CDC programs working at local, state and federal levels of the public health system. 
In addition to their regular assignments in the public health system, PHAs are called upon to respond to disease outbreaks or health disaster. Establishing a locally trained and geographically varied workforce has allowed CDC to have ready and deployable human resources for emergencies or emerging needs anywhere in the world. PHAs are part of a deployable team that can be credited with the eradication of smallpox, the identification of new strains of disease, and the halting of epidemics. PHAs have been called to respond to outbreaks of disease such as hantavirus, Lassa fever, monkeypox, encephalitis, tuberculosis, measles, AIDS, smallpox, polio, Legionnella, Guillain-Barré syndrome, SARS, syphilis, PPNG, babesiosis, and cholera. 
PHAs were assigned to work in health campaigns such as Guinea worm, malaria, syphilis, diarrheal diseases, yellow fever, yaws, swine flu, and measles. PHAs have been sent to respond to major events such as floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and the anthrax scare in the U.S. They even were assigned to be poll watchers in select Southern states during the 1972 and 1976 presidential elections.

I'll Try

"I'll Try" is a song written and recorded by American country music artist Alan Jackson. It was released in January 1996 as the second single from his 1995 compilation album "The Greatest Hits Collection". Like "Tall, Tall Trees" (the other newly recorded track on that compilation), it was a number-one hit on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks. It also reached number 5 on the Canadian "RPM" Country Tracks chart.
Background and writing.
Jackson told "Billboard" magazine, "Everybody kept telling me, 'You need to come out with a positive love song.' I've had a lot of sad ballads, but I have a hard time writing those love songs because there's a tendency to get real sappy with them so they're not real. That's the way most of them come off to me. I wanted to write one that was realistic, what I call a realistic approach to a positive love song."
Content.
The song is a mid-tempo love ballad with the male narrator pledging his faithfulness to his significant other. The line "Both know damn well it's not easy together," from the first verse, was changed to "Both know too well..." in the radio edit.
Critical reception.
Deborah Evans Price of "Billboard" magazine reviewed the song favorably, saying "How refreshing—an honest love song. Instead of promising the moon and stars, Jackson has penned a song that simply says, "I'm not perfect, just another man/But I will give you all that I am/And I'll try to love only you/And I'll try my best to be true/Oh darlin' I'll try." What more could a woman want? Honesty is the best policy, and this realistic look at love is destined to be a hit with country music lovers everywhere."
Chart positions.
"I'll Try" debuted at number 67 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of December 30, 1995.

Louis de Lotbiniere-Harwood

Dr Louis de Lotbinière-Harwood (1866–1934) M.D., F.A.C.S., was a Canadian gynaecologist. He was Dean of Medicine at Université de Montréal, the second campus of Université Laval. He was President of the Medical Union of Canada, President of the Hôpital Notre-Dame and President of the Radium Institute, Paris. His reputation as an educator and a surgeon extended throughout North America and Europe, recognised through his creation as an "Officier de Le Légion d'honneur" in France. He has been referred to as the 'Father of Canadian Gynaecology'.
Early life.
Born at the Manor of Vaudreuil, he was the son of The Hon. Henry Stanislas Harwood and his wife Josephine Sydney Brauneis. He was a nephew of Antoine Chartier de Lotbinière Harwood, Robert Harwood and The Rt. Hon. Sir Henri Elzéar Taschereau P.C. One of his first cousins was married to Canadian hero Major-General Sir Sam Steele and another, Archibald Chaussegros de Lery MacDonald (1862–1939), was a founder of the Museum at Château Ramezay; built by the brother-in-law of one of de Lotbinière-Harwood's ancestors.
Educated at the Séminaire de Ste-Thérèse and afterwards at the Séminaire de Rigaud. In 1890, de Lotbiniere-Harwood graduated in medicine from Université Laval, Quebec City. In 1894, he went to Europe to take a course of advanced studies, particularly gynaecology. In France, he had the opportunity to study under, and serve as the assistant to Samuel Jean de Pozzi, who was then France's foremost gynaecologist and would remain his mentor throughout his career.
Career.
Returning to Montreal in 1896, de Lotbinière-Harwood was appointed assistant gynaecologist at the Hôpital Notre-Dame under Dr Brennan, until Brennan's death in 1903 when he became the head gynaecologist. During World War One, he was the moving spirit in the patriotic effort that resulted in the foundation of the General Military Hospital of Laval located at Joinville-le-Pont near Paris.
He was widely regarded as the accredited international link between the English and French members of his profession, and France rewarded him for this by making him an Officer of the Légion d'honneur. He was one of the promoters of the conference of French-speaking members of the medical profession which was first held in Montreal and was attended by all the prominent French doctors of the day in Europe and North America.
He held several the prominent office: Dean of the Medical Faculty of University of Montreal (1918); Professor of Gynaecology at the University of Montreal; Superintendent of the University Council; President of the Hôpital Notre-Dame; President of the Radium Institute, Paris; corresponding Secretary of the Surgical Society of Paris; Vice-President of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada; Vice-President of the Association of French-speaking Doctors of North America; Fellow of the American College of Surgeons; member of the General Board of Examiners; President of the Medical Union of Canada and vice-president of the Cercle Universitaire. He was a director of and a contributor to "L'Union Medicale du Canada" for fifteen years. A contemporary at the University of Montreal (where some described him as the 'Father of Canadian Gynaecology') said of him,
"A charming man, never reading, in no way devoted to letters, he yet possessed an untiring activity, a great ambition, a talent for action and government which made him a remarkable dean. One need not look for his writings, he wrote little. One need not analyse his teaching, he made scarcely more of this. But, with the help of his friends, he reorganised the Faculty of Medicine, accomplished the reconstruction of the Notre-Dame Hospital, and in the direction of the University of Montreal, he took a leading part... His charm and his distinguished manners had gained for him the respect of every one whom he met. His high stature, the dignity of his bearing, the distinction of his gesture commanded general attention... a gentleman with all the meaning that this word implies... Gifted with great executive ability, a nimble mind, tact and unusual charm of manner, he would seem to have been destined for pre-eminence in any station".
Family.
His chief pastime was farming and cattle breeding. He was vice-president of the Holstein (cattle) Breeders Association of Quebec, and his farm where he lived at Vaudreuil, "Het Loo", was noted for its fine herd of Holstein-Friesen cattle. He was married three times. In 1891, he married his cousin, Marie-Berthe-Adéline Masson (1871-1904), daughter of Henri Masson (1836-1880) and Coralie Globensky, niece of Lt.-Colonel Maximilien Globensky. She was a granddaughter of Joseph Masson of Château de Terrebonne, and the stepdaughter of another of his relations, Sir Henri-Thomas Taschereau, brother of Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, Prime Minister of Quebec. She died while travelling in Europe at Paris.

HM Prison Erlestoke

HM Prison Erlestoke is a Category C men's prison, located in the village of Erlestoke in Wiltshire, England. Erlestoke is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is the only prison in Wiltshire.
History.
Erlestoke is housed in a country house built by Joshua Smith, Member of Parliament for Devizes, between 1780 and 1810. During the Second World War the house was used as a training school for the Special Operations Executive. It was seriously damaged by a fire in 1950 and was then converted into a prison with many modern buildings.
In 1998, it was reported that thieves had broken into Erlestoke Prison and stolen £3000 worth of gardening tools from a shed. Two years later, two inmates from Erlestoke used a makeshift ladder in a daylight jailbreak. The two escapees then stole a car from a nearby farm, but then crashed it, and were subsequently recaptured by the police.
In December 2001, an inspection of Erlestoke by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons found cells in the oldest part of the prison had damp walls and poor furniture. Cleanliness was also criticised, as was the ability of some staff "to adapt to new ideas on rehabilitation" at the prison.
However a year later, a report declared Erlestoke Prison one of the best in the country, with a Government official describing the inspection report as "astoundingly good".
In March 2005, a report from the Independent Monitoring Board found that violent incidents at the prison had dramatically increased, to 1,400 annual incidents from its previous 800. Months later, an employment tribunal awarded nearly £400,000 damages to a white South African officer of the prison for "enduring years of racial abuse" in connection with black prisoners targeting him for his clearly identifiable accent. According to the officer, he had received little assistance from the Prison's management.
The prison today.
Erlestoke Prison receives adult male prisoners from much of England and Wales, as well as from local prisons in South Wales and Bristol in particular. Accommodation at the prison comprises eight accommodation units, 3 Enhanced (Imber, Kennet and Sarum); 3 Standard (Alfred, Wessex and Silbury); 1 Lifer and long-term prisoner unit (Avebury) and an Induction Unit (Marlborough). Most cells are single occupancy with integral sanitation. However there are a small number of double, purpose-built cells on two of the accommodation units, and two three-bed cells on one other accommodation unit.
The visitors centre at Erlestoke Prison has a refreshments facility, as well as a children's play area with a crèche operating at weekends.
Attempted escapes.
In September 2010, a low-risk prisoner, doing gardening work outside the prison, decided to escape with the prison's tractor that he was using at the time. Having travelled about ten miles, he was spotted by a former prison officer from Erlestoke who recognized the tractor and alerted the authorities, before tailing the tractor. Realizing he was being pursued, the prisoner drove onto a golf course and was followed by several police vehicles; after abandoning the vehicle, he tried to flee on foot but was cornered by a police dog and taken back into custody.

The corners are banked at 17 degrees. The 2010 track record of 10.28 seconds in a winged sprint car was the world record for quarter-mile paved ovals until a sprint car driver qualified at Slinger Speedway in 9.909 seconds in August 2010. The track holds a USAC national midget race and it held national American Speed Association (ASA) races before the original tour ended.
The quote, "It's Like racing jet fighters in a gym", is attributed to noted short track driver Dick Trickle concerning racing late model stock cars at the track.
Little 500.
The track hosts the annual Pay Less Little 500 on the Saturday of the Memorial Day weekend, the night before the Indianapolis 500. At 500 laps, the race is unusually long for sprint car races, and is considered one of the premier sprint car races. The field consists of 33 cars lined up in eleven rows of three, mimicking the traditional Indy 500 lineup. Many eventual Indy 500 drivers competed in the Little 500 over the years. The 61st edition of the Pay Less Little 500 will pay out over $123,000, making it the biggest asphalt sprint car payout in the world.

Who's Cheatin' Who

"Who's Cheatin' Who" is the title of a country music song written by Jerry Hayes and initially recorded by Charly McClain. It was the title track of her 1980 album for Epic Records, released in November 1980 as a single with "Love Scenes" on the B-side, and in early 1981 became her first Number One hit on the "Billboard" country charts. Seventeen years later, Alan Jackson had chart success with the song as well, with his cover version reaching Top Five on the country charts.
Alan Jackson version.
In 1997, Alan Jackson covered the song on his album "Everything I Love", releasing it as a single that year. Jackson's cover features several solos after the last chorus. Jackson also switches the song's pronouns to put it in a male's perspective. His version includes a series of extended electric guitar and piano solos before the final chorus.
Music video.

Biography.
Watson was born in Weston, Ontario. He was awarded the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography for his photograph, taken in 1993 while covering the civil war in Somalia for the "Toronto Star" newspaper. The photograph depicted US Army 160th SOAR, Super 64 crew chief Staff Sgt. William Cleveland's body being dragged by Somalis through the streets of Mogadishu.
While at the "Toronto Star", Watson earned four Canadian National Newspaper Awards for photography and stories on the child sex trade in Asia, anarchy in Somalia following the 1991 overthrow dictator Mohammed Siad Barre, and the torture and murder of a Somali teen by Canadian soldiers after a U.S.-led force intervened to end a famine in 1992.

Las 13 rosas

Plot.
In Madrid in 1939 during the final days of the Spanish Civil War, Virtudes and Carmen, two young idealistic Republican militants, are encouraging their neighbours to keep faith in the cause of the Republic. However, the entry of Franco's victorious troops into the city is eminent. Fearing the bloody repression that was coming, many Republicans are fleeing the country while others are unable or unwilling to do so. 
Julia, a streetcar attendant and her friend, Adelina, a Red Cross worker, are also active sympathizers of the Spanish Republic. While spending an evening in a nightclub watching musicians perform, one of the last bombings of the city takes place. In those dire circumstances they befriend Blanca, whose husband Enrique is the musicians's band leader.
The triumph of the Francoist troops marks a dark turning point in the lives of those who sympathized with the Republic. Canepa, one of the musicians in Enrique's band, is a Republican militant. Fearing for his life, he decides to leave the country. Blanca, Enrique's wife, gives him some money to help him on his way. Meanwhile, Julia strikes up a relationship with dapper young nationalist soldier Perico. 
It is rumored that there was a plot to assassinate Franco on his victorious entry into the capital, and the nationalists are seeking revenge. Although the girls have nothing to do with it, they have been targeted for their propagandistic leftist activities. The first to be arrested is Julia, who, before too long, is being sadistically tortured by the orders of Fontenla, the cold-hearted officer in charge of the interrogations. Adelina, Virtudes' co-worker, like most of the others is a member of a socialist group. She is turned in by her well-meaning father in the naïve belief that nothing serious would happened to her and that she is just wanted for questioning. 
Canepa and Teo are turned in by friends and neighbors and are tortured. Canepa commits suicide while under arrest. Teo has better luck and is eventually released on the condition that he has to secretly help to identify and capture his friends, sympathizers of the Republic. With Teo's help, one by one the girls are arrested, and soon they have all been jailed. Only Carmen, the youngest of the girls of the group realizes Teo's doublecrossing, but she is also arrested. Blanca also suffers the same fate. Her only crime is to have given Canepa some money. After suffering heavy police interrogations, the young group of women are eventually transferred to an overcrowded prison. 
The reunion of the girls in jail serves as a consolation to their dire circumstances. At one point, they even enjoy a bit of tap-dancing. Their families, including Adelina's grief-stricken father, are hoping that they would eventually be released. Blanca is worried about her small son that she was forced to leave behind. Her admirable behaviour and her serenity while in jail made her gain the respect of the woman in charge of the prison.
However, their situation worsens when the group of women complain of the terrible sanitary condition for the children imprisoned with their mothers. As a protest they jointly refused to sing the praises of the Franco regime. The fate of the 13 young women is sealed when two military officers and an innocent woman are killed in cold blood by a group of leftist revolutionaries. As a punishment, the regime order the execution of some of the prisoners, though they have nothing to do with what have happened while they are in jail. A military court condemned the 48 men and 13 young women to death in less than 48 hours.
Carmen, the youngest of all, is the only survivor of the group. Desolated she listens to the shots that killed her terrified friends.
The final frame of the film asserts that the bulk of the content is verifiable from documentation and that the script relies heavily on actual dialogue or writings from the central characters.
Overview.
The film is based on real-life events. It tells the story of 13 young women who were sentenced to death by a military court for a crime they had not committed: an attack on a military official during the first years of Franco's dictatorship in which three people died. The women were already in jail when the assault took place.
Arrested a month after the end of the Spanish Civil War, the women were sympathizers of the socialist Spanish Republic which was overthrown by the fascist Nationalist forces. They suffered harsh interrogations and were jailed at Las Ventas in Madrid. The women, known as the 13 roses were executed at dawn on August 5, 1939. Director Emilio Martinez-Lazaros opted to focus the film on fewer than half of the 13 women, however the plot follows several story lines.
Reception.
"Las 13 Rosas" opened on October 19, 2007. In Spain the film only had a lukewarm reception from critics and audience. On the other hand, one elderly woman was heard to exclaim, after its first showing, that General Franco himself could not have known of the executions. To provoke that sense of worry in at least one viewer might itself be considered an achievement.
The film had a limited release in the USA in New York City. The review in "Variety" praised the cinematography and art direction, but remarked: ""The 13 Roses" largely withers on the vine. film is further let down by its psychological superficiality… an uncertain treatment which convinces neither historically nor dramatically".
Awards.
"Las 13 rosas" received 14 nominations to the Goya Awards. It won four Goyas: Best Cinematography, best Costume design, best original score and best supporting actor (José Manuel Cervino).
DVD release.
" Las 13 Rosas " is available in Region 2 DVD in Spanish with English subtitles.

Dog leukocyte antigen

The dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) is a part of the major hisocompatability complex (MHC) in dogs, the DLA encodes for genes in the MHC. The DLA and MHC system are interchangeable terms in canines. The MHC plays a critical role in the immune response system and consists of three regions, class I, class II and class III. DLA is associated with the first two classes which are involved in the regulation of antigens in the immune system. The class II genes are highly polymorphic with many different alleles/haplotypes that have been linked to diseases, alergies, and autoimmune conditions such as diabetes, polyarthritus, and hypothyroidism in canines.
There’s likely hundreds of immunologically relevant genes making up the DLA region in the canine genome, as of present date the complete characteristics of the gene is unknown. MHC genes represent candidate susceptibility in canines; some alleles promote protection against immune-mediated diseases and some increase susceptibility. For example certain combinations of the DLA-DRB1 and DQ alleles are most favorable for good immune regulation. These alleles help balance immune surveillance and immune response without increasing the risk of developing an autoimmune condition. Different canine breeds have MHC/DLA allele association; these genes exhibit more inter-breed differentiation than intra breed differentiation. Dogs have been selectively bred for different genotypes and phenotypes, selection in the DLA genome can lead to an increase in the prevalence of immune-mediated diseases. Due to selective breeding some breeds have become restricted in their DLA genes which explain the different immune responses in different breeds. This is because there is a strong linkage disequilibrium that exists between DLA class II loci. The pattern displayed by the differences in human ethnic groups is analogous to the pattern displayed by the distribution of DLA types in different canine breeds. MHC genes in humans are also known to be major contributors to autoimmune condition development.
Canine diabetes and DLA.
In 1974 J. Nerup and others discovered that there is a link between diabetes and MHC genes. Dog leukocyte antigen has been found to be the genetic component associated with canine diabetes. The common alleles/haplotypes found in diabetes prone breeds (Samoyed, Carin Terrier, and Tibetan Terrier) are DLA DBR1*009, DQA1*001, and DQB1*008. The DLA DQA1 alleles code for an arginine amino acid at position 55 in region two, this increases the risk of developing diabetes in dog as arginine is a positive amino acid which can impair antigen binding. This allele is also associated with hypothyroidism which implies that this allele increases susceptibility for endocrinopathic immune-mediated diseases. It is possible that the link discovered between DLA associations and diabetes could be due to "makers" of susceptibility and that the true reason for susceptibility lies elsewhere in the genome. It could be associated with particular DLA alleles/haplotypes or caused by the strong linkage disequilibrium.

Here in the Real World (song)

"Here in the Real World" is the title of a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Alan Jackson. It was released in January 1990 as the second single and title track from his debut album "Here in the Real World", and in early 1990 it became his first Top 40 country hit. The song reached a peak of number 3 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts, and number 1 on the Canadian "RPM" Top Country Tracks charts. Jackson wrote the song with Mark Irwin.
Content.
The song is a mid-tempo backed by fiddle and steel-string acoustic guitar, in which the narrator observes the difference between an idealized movie situation and the real world, saying "If life were like the movies, I'd never be blue". In the chorus, he observes that "here in the real world, it's not that easy at all / 'Cause when hearts get broken, it's real tears that fall."
Critical reception.
Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A grade," calling the conceit "bloody well brilliant, what with the juxtaposition of reality and fiction, but none of its intelligence would matter without the heartbroke sincerity that gives it its simplicity." 
Music video.
The music video was directed by Jim May and premiered in early 1990.

Geoffrey Wawro

Geoffrey Wawro (born 1960) is a Professor of Military History at the University of North Texas, and Director of the UNT Military History Center. His primary area of emphasis is modern and contemporary military history, from the French Revolution to the present. His fourth book appeared in April 2010 from Penguin Press; it is titled: "Quicksand: America's Pursuit of Power in the Middle East."
Education and career.
Wawro grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut and as a young boy delivered newspapers for the "Hartford Courant". Wawro received his diploma from the Loomis-Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut in 1978, and his A-levels in English Literature and German from Cheltenham College, in England, the following year. After receiving his Bachelor's degree "magna cum laude" from Brown University (1983), he attended Yale University, where he received his Master of Arts in European History (1987), his M. Phil. in European History in 1989, and his Ph.D. in 1992. His dissertation, entitled, "The Austro-Prussian War: Politics, Strategy and War in the Habsburg Monarchy, 1859-1866" (1992), supervised by Paul Kennedy, argued that the battle of Koniggratz (1866) was not so much won by the brilliance of the Prussian commander Helmuth von Moltke the Elder but was more lost by the incompetence of the Austrian commander Ludwig von Benedek.
Wawro hosted the History Channel's book show: "Hardcover History", and was host and anchor of the History Channel programs History's Business and History vs. Hollywood, as well as "Hard Target,' "Global View, and "History in Focus." His guests have included Jimmy Carter, Henry Kissinger, Jack Welch, Robert Rubin, Caspar Weinberger, Warren Christopher, Niall Ferguson, Richard Overy, Stephen Ambrose, Michael Howard, Robert Dallek, Paul Theroux and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.. Wawro, an expert on military innovation and international security in Europe, the U.S., and Canada, was also (before his move to Texas) Professor of Strategic Studies at the U.S. Naval War College as well as the "Naval War College Review's" "special correspondent," a designation that took him to "places or events of strategic or technological interest," including Iran, Brazil and the Paris Air Show.
Wawro won the Austrian Cultural Institute Prize and the Society for Military History Moncado Prize for Excellence in the Writing of Military History. From 1989 to 1991, he was Fulbright Scholar, University of Vienna, Austria, and from 1991–92, an Andrew W. Mellon Doctoral Fellow, Yale University.
Publications.
In addition to many peer reviewed articles and edited volumes, Wawro has written four well-received books. His latest book, "Quicksand: America's Pursuit of Power in the Middle East" was published by Penguin Press in 2010. His
"Franco-Prussian War (Cambridge, 2003)" was the main selection of the History Book Club and Military Book Club and received a best non-fiction mention from Publisher's Weekly, Nov. 2003.
His "Austro-Prussian War "(Cambridge, 1996), based on his doctoral dissertation, was History Book Club and Military Book Club main selection. His "Warfare and Society in Europe, 1792-1914" (Routledge, 2000) is a standard university text. In addition, he has also served on the editorial teams for over twenty volumes, including "The Cambridge Military Histories," which he co-edits with Oxford's Hew Strachan.

Bilious fever was a medical diagnosis often used for any fever that exhibited the symptom of nausea or vomiting in addition to an increase in internal body temperature and strong diarrhea. "Bilious" means the condition was thought to arise from disorders of bile, the two types of which were two of the Four Humours of traditional Galenic medicine in 200 A.D. 
The term is obsolete and no longer used, but was used by medical practitioners in the 18th and 19th centuries, often cited as a cause on death certificates. Modern diagnoses for the same symptoms would include a wide range of conditions and infections.

The Hildyard Baronetcy, of Patrington in the County of York, was a title in the Baronetage of England. It was created on 25 June 1660 for Robert Hilyard, of Patrington and Winestead. The ancient Hildyard family is thought to have been of Norman origin. Robert Hildyard served as Gentleman of the Bedchamber to King Charles I of England and was a Major-General in the King's army during the English Civil War. He took part in the Battle of Marston Moor. He was raised to a baronetcy by Charles II following the Restoration of the Monarchy. He was succeeded by his grandson Sir Robert Hildyard, 2nd Baronet. He sat as Member of Parliament for Hedon. He was succeeded by his nephew, the third Baronet, who was Member of Parliament for Great Bedwyn. The latter's son, the fourth Baronet, was High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1783. On his death in 1814 the baronetcy became extinct.

"Money Made" is the fourth single from Australian rock band AC/DC from their fifteenth studio album "Black Ice". The song was released only through Radio airplay in Australia in July 2009, and in the UK as a CD along with "War Machine". Angus Young declared that his inspiration for the song was the obsession with money in United States - "The focus seems to be, ‘How do we get money out of this? Do we keep that school? Is there a profit in it? Do we really need that new hospital? Can you not die quicker? Do we really have to spend money on that medicine? How old are you now?’ Sometimes you think, Can we all take one deep breath? The basics have got to be in place. Thirty years ago, a fuckin’ school never made money. Filling in a road or putting up a traffic light didn’t make money. Hospitals were there to keep people well, not make money." Bassist Cliff Williams has stated it is his favourite track from "Black Ice", saying "It has a chaingang vibe to it."

<doc id="20029263" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20029263" title="Nemattanew">
Nemattanew

Nemattanew (also spelled Nemattanow; died 1621 or 1622) was a renegade captain of the Powhatan Confederacy, and at times a close advisor to paramount chief Opechancanough.
He first appears in English records in 1611, when George Percy mentioned 'Munetute' as being sent by paramount chief Wahunsunacawh to lead native resistance to the colonists' expansion in the upper James River region around the time Henricus was built, in the course of the First Anglo-Powhatan War. Percy also notes that the English derisively called him Jack-of-the-Feather on account of his feathered native war regalia, remarking that "he used to come into the field all covered over with feathers and swans' wings fastened unto his shoulders, as though he meant to fly". 
On account of the fact that he was never wounded in these skirmishes, it seems that he began to believe he was magically invulnerable to musket-fire, and that he managed to persuade his fellow tribesmen of this attribute, enhancing his reputation with them.
In the more peaceful times following the war, he continued to play a prominent role; the English even trained him to become a proficient musket shot. At one point in 1618, he turned renegade and again raided the English, capturing some guns, but these were returned by Opechancanough.
In 1619, Opechancanough sent him to propose that the English contribute 8 to 10 soldiers to accompany a Powhatan war party for an assault on a Siouan tribe above the fall line, to avenge some Powhatan women they had slain. In return, the Powhatans would equally share all plundered captives, corn and territory with the English. This proposal was accepted by the council, however failed ever to materialize. 
A short time before the Great Massacre of 1622, Nemattanew appeared at the home of a certain Morgan, where he saw some trading-trinkets and proposed taking Morgan to Pamunkey where a good price might be had for them. Morgan agreed and was never seen again, but a few days later Nemattanew showed up at the plantation and announced his death. The fact that he was wearing Morgan's hat caused the field-hands to suspect he might have played a role in his murder, but when they tried to force him to go with them to the nearest magistrate, he offered much resistance, causing one of the field-hands to shoot him. As he lay dying, he begged them to be buried behind English lines, and not to reveal to his people that he had been felled by English fire, to which he was supposedly invincible. 
In England, Captain John Smith, who had not been in Virginia since 1609, wrote in his 1624 "Generall Historie" of Nemattanew's death as occurring only two weeks before the massacre, but Rountree infers from contemporary documents, particularly "Council in Virginia", that it occurred no later than November 1621, while George Yeardley was still governor, and a full five months before the massacre. There is also some evidence in this document that by 1621, Nemattanew had again fallen out of favor with Opechancanough. However, there is a variety of speculations among modern historians as to what Nemattanew's true role may have been, with general agreement that the massacre was already in its planning stages before Nemattanew died, rather than a reaction to his being killed.

The station was opened by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway in 1933 to serve the increasing numbers of holidaymakers who were visiting the Norfolk Broads and coastal beaches within reach of the village of Sutton. This attempt to increase revenue on the line was, however, short-lived as the Halt failed to survive its first summer, possibly due to its location on the northern extremity of the Broads. The single station platform was very basic in design, consisting of no more than a few sleepers at ground level, with passengers alighting with the aid of a set of retractable steps leading down from the Sentinel Railcar which called at the tourist halts on the line.

Stratified Morse theory

In mathematics, stratified Morse theory is an analogue to Morse theory for general stratified spaces, originally developed by Mark Goresky and Robert MacPherson. The main point of the theory is to consider functions formula_1 and consider how the stratified space formula_2 changes as the real number formula_3 changes. Morse theory of stratified spaces has uses everywhere from pure mathematics topics such as braid groups and representations to robot motion planning and potential theory. A popular application in pure mathematics is Morse theory on manifolds with boundary, and manifolds with corners.

<doc id="20029385" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20029385" title="The IU">
The IU

The IU is an international umbrella organisation for land value tax reformers. It has members in 35 countries around the world - activists, politicians, professionals and academics, and some 70 national and local organisations. The IU enjoys Special Consultative Status at the United Nations.
Principles.
The objectives of the IU are "to stimulate in all countries a public opinion favourable to permanent peace and prosperity for all people, through the progressive removal of the basic economic causes of poverty and war". The IU's work is guided by principles of equal freedom and sharing of common resources of community and nature - ideas most cogently set out in modern times in the writings of the 19th-century American reformer Henry George. Specifically, towards the realisation of its objectives, the IU "favours the raising of public revenues by public collection of the rental value of land apart from improvements"; and, further, favours "the abolition of taxes, tariffs, or imposts of every sort that interfere with the free production and exchange of wealth". Following from those principles the IU advances a radical land and fiscal reform agenda and 'real' free trade (i.e. that does not privilege Western corporate interests). The principal policies advocated by the IU are the public collection of 'resource rents' and land value taxation, in lieu of traditional taxation.
Organisation.
The IU is governed by an Executive Committee of officers including Vice-Presidents from each sovereign state with significant representation within the membership, and other members. The IU is funded mainly by members' subscriptions, donations and legacies. The IU's work is supported by voluntary effort.
History.
The IU was founded at an international conference held in Denmark in 1926. The conference was attended by some 500 delegates, all advocates of the ideas of Henry George. In 1992 the IU was accredited to the United Nations as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO). In 2003 it was granted Special Consultative Status by the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), which widened the scope of its engagement and influence in United Nations' processes. The IU retains 12 UN representatives who serve the world organisation's offices in New York, Geneva, Addis Ababa, Bangkok and Santiago.
Since its founding, the IU has held periodic international conferences and published conference papers. Until recently, with the exception of its UN work, the IU's principal function was to provide a forum for land and tax reformers around the world to exchange ideas at conference. At its 2006 Conference, in London, the IU agreed it "shall transform itself into an active and outgoing professional organisation". The IU now maintains a part-time professional secretariat and engages in significant project work and initiatives in pursuit of its objectives.
Campaigns and publications.
At the Swanwick Conference in England in 1949 - as the United Nations was settling its Universal Declaration of Human Rights - the IU published a principle and policy pamphlet that later came to be known as its Declaration of Human Rights on Equal Freedom. This Declaration was translated into many languages, and subsequently amended and reaffirmed; most recently in 2001.
In 2008 the IU launched a global online petition to reform the UDHR by amending its Articles 3 and 29 to include "a universal right to a place on earth".
The IU is in the course of publishing the 'Economics of Abundance' series of monographs, written by the British economist Fred Harrison. The first volume, published in 2008, titled The Silver Bullet, deals with global poverty.
Through its UN representatives the IU supports LVT implementation projects around the world, including South Africa, Nigeria and Vanuatu. The IU has contributed to the development of the Land Rights and Land Value Capture online course and training program created under the auspices of the UN's Global Land Tools Network.
The IU has produced (2008) two documentary short films on human rights and poverty in southern Africa.

Sweet Revenge (1998 film)

Sweet Revenge is a 1998 British comedy film written and directed by Malcolm Mowbray. The screenplay is based on the epic two-part play "The Revengers' Comedies" by Alan Ayckbourn.
The film had a brief and modestly successful theatrical run in Italy under the title "Amori e vendette (Loves and Vendettas)" but failed to find a distributor elsewhere. It eventually was telecast in the UK by BBC Two on December 30, 1999, under the title "The Revengers' Comedies". It was released on videotape in the United States and France and on DVD in the US.
Plot synopsis.
The plot, reminiscent of the Alfred Hitchcock film "Strangers on a Train", focuses on two disparate characters. Conservative Henry Bell has been eased out of his job by condescending Bruce Tick, while wealthy and wildly eccentric Karen Knightly has been abandoned by her lover Anthony Staxton-Billing, who opted to return to his wife Imogen. Both are intent on committing suicide by leaping from the Tower Bridge in London. When neither succeeds, they strike a bargain whereby each agrees to exact revenge on behalf of the other, although Henry is less enthusiastic about the plan.
Karen, disguised as a frumpy office temp, finds employment as an assistant to Tick and quickly derails his marriage by leading his wife Hilary to believe he's involved in an extramarital affair. Henry, meanwhile, is finding it difficult to keep his end of the bargain, since he has fallen in love with Imogen, the object of Karen's revenge. Instead of planning her demise, he begins an affair with the beguiling woman. Henry learns that Anthony left Karen not for Imogen, but for beautician Daphne Teal, and he begins to suspect Karen is more of a villain than a victim. The woman proves to be a formidable foe when she realizes Henry may renege on their deal.
Adding to the humorous complications are Karen's oddball brother Oliver, who delights in racing through the interior of their rural mansion on his motor scooter; elderly and slightly befuddled housekeeper Winnie; and Daphne's very inept daughter Norma, who's being groomed to take over the household chores so Winnie finally can retire.
Production.
Rural scenes were filmed in Weston Turville in Buckinghamshire. Interiors were filmed at the Twickenham Film Studios in London.
Critical reception.
David Rooney of "Variety" called the film a "mix of dry British wit, sophisticated farce and arch eccentricity," "the kind of material that can sparkle onstage but often sits uneasily onscreen, and tends to have limited pull with today's audiences." He added, "Aside from its humor, Ayckbourn's work is notable for its brisk pacing, multilateral action and the ingenuity of its complex structuring, all qualities that lose something in the screen transfer . . . Mowbray's script opens out the action physically but is unable to shake off the stagy feel. To his credit, he never shies away from the savagery that flavors the best black comedies, but the verve needed to make this one a complete success is nonetheless missing."

Deaf People in Hitler's Europe

"Deaf People in Hitler's Europe" (2002) is a non-fiction book written by Donna F. Ryan and John S. Schuchman inspired by the conference "Deaf People in Hitler’s Europe, 1933-1945" hosted jointly by Gallaudet University and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1998. It tells the story of deaf people during the Holocaust.
Summary.
The Nazi campaign against the handicapped began on July 14, 1933 with the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring. The Nazis sterilized people with disabilities such as mental illness, retardation, blindness, and deaf people. It was justified by scientists and the doctors who certified patients conditions as hereditary in order to prevent such handicapped people from bearing children. Teachers and others were involved in the certification process. 375,000 people were sterilized by force and an estimated 17,000 of the people sterilized were deaf. Later Action T4 killed thousands of people who were "judged incurably sick, by critical medical examination" from 1939-41 officially and up to 1945 unofficially.

Baby Jane (Dr. Feelgood song)

"Baby Jane" is a song recorded by soul singer Otis Clay in 1969 for Dakar Records. Dr. Feelgood covered the track in 1977, it first appeared on "Be Seeing You", a Dr. Feelgood album released in September that year. 
"Baby Jane" was also released as a single in the UK in November 1977. 
The song was written by Bishop, Nesbitt, Reed, Simmons and Wilson (except from Lee Simmons all other co-writers were members of legendary funk band "Pieces of Peace", so it is likely that Pieces of Peace were the backing band for Otis Clay). "Baby Jane" was produced by Nick Lowe, the song was Dr. Feelgood's eighth single. The b-side of the record, "Looking Back", was penned by Johnny "Guitar" Watson. (Not to be confused with "Johnny Guitar"; Dr. Feelgood's guitarist from 1981 to 1983) 
The record did not make the UK Singles Chart. A 12" vinyl was also issued, which included a third track, a live recording of the B.B. King penned, "You Upset Me Baby". The live take was recorded at the Paddocks, Canvey Island, by Vic Maile with the Maison Rouge Mobile, on 10 June 1977. The cover shown (right) is from the 12" release, as the 7" did not have a picture sleeve. 
On 20 September 1977, Dr. Feelgood recorded it for a Peel Session on BBC Radio 1. Their set list included "Baby Jane", along with "You Upset Me Baby", "She's a Windup" and "99.5".
A version of "Baby Jane" was also included in Dr. Feelgood's 1979 live album, "As It Happens", and on a number of their compilation albums, such as "Singles - The UA Years". The song was still a staple of Dr. Feelgood's live repertoire in 2010.

Rastokhez

The Rastokhez (Revival) party was a political party in Tajikistan in the years of independence and civil war (1989–1997).
It was founded on September 14, 1989, by members of the Tajik intelligentsia, among them Tohir Abdujabbor, with a moderate nationalist and democratic program.
Its prominent position in the opposition to the ruling Communist Party of Tajikistan insured that it became the main scapegoat for the Dushanbe riots of February 1990. The party was banned, which ensured total victory for the Communists in the upcoming elections.
During the next years and the Tajik Civil War, Rastokhez, then underground, as well as the similarly minded Democratic Party, participated in the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) along with more Islamic groups. The party ceased to exist at the same time as the UTO, its members having mostly joined the Democratic Party at the time of the peace treaty (June 1997).

Max Gimblett

Max Gimblett (born 5 December 1935) is one of New Zealand's most internationally prominent and successful living artists. He is well known for his paintings, sculpture, ink drawings, works on paper, and artist’s books.
Life and work.
Max Gimblett was born in Auckland, New Zealand, a second generation New Zealander.
Gimblett attended Auckland Grammar School in 1950, and left New Zealand in 1956 to travel throughout Europe until 1961, with a brief return to Auckland for a year in 1958-59. Traveling to the America's in 1962, Gimblett apprenticed with master potter Roman Bartkiw in Toronto, Canada and then worked with master ceramist Merton Chambers from 1962-1964. In 1964 he married Barbara Kirshenblatt. That same year he studied drawing at the Ontario College of Art, Toronto. In 1965 he studied painting at the San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco, California.
From 1967 to 1970, he lived and painted in Bloomington, Indiana where Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett was completing her PhD in Folklore Studies. From 1970 to 1972 he resided in Austin, Texas, where Barbara was an associate professor in the English department at the University of Texas, Austin.
Gimblett moved to New York in 1972 and in 1974 formed an affinity and enduring friendship with the experimental filmmaker and kinetic sculptor Len Lye, who was a fellow New Zealander. Gimblett continued to support his work after Lye's death and in 1990 he became a trustee of the Len Lye Foundation based in New Plymouth, New Zealand.
Gimblett continued to live in New York returning to New Zealand only for brief visits. In 1979 Gimblett became an American Citizen.
Gimblett's work is rich and inventive. He is known for his great technical and stylistic range: the monochrome, geometric abstraction, the calligraphic and figurative expressionism all find a place in the work. He uses novel shaped supports: ovals, circles, and rings. However the quatrefoil is the shape he has really made his own.
"The quatrefoil is defined ..." writes Thomas McEvilley, "as ‘a compound leaf or flower consisting of four (usually rounded) leaflets or petals radiating from a common center.’ Most of Gimblett’s works in this format are geometrised, meaning that the petals of the flowers are not merely rounded in an organic sense but are composed of four perfect circles that intersect at a single point. It is a format which virtually no other modern artist has emphasized."
Gimblett draws freely on Buddhism, Christianity, classical mythology, and alchemy, Jung. His work can be understood in the context of Western Buddhism.
"The Influence of Zen," writes Thomas McEvilley, "for example, seems natural to Gimblett, and carries with it an echo of Asia’s proximity to New Zealand, but also can be traced partly to American artists with West Coast connections such as Clyfford Still and Mark Tobey. Gimblett has made a harmonious post-war synthesis of America and Japan."
Gimblett’s first solo painting exhibition was at Dave Hickey’s A Clean Well Lighted Place in Austin in 1971.
In 1975 he joined the Cuningham Ward Gallery, New York where he exhibited with Ross Bleckner, John Walker, David Reed, John Elderfield, and Lynton Wells.
In 1989 he was awarded the National Endowment for the Arts Painting Fellowship.
In 1990 Gimblett joined the Haines Gallery, San Francisco and the Gow Langsford Gallery, Auckland. Both of these galleries continue to represent him today.
In 1991 he participated in a residency at The Rockefeller Foundation, Study and Conference Center, Bellagio, Lake Como, Italy.
Gimblett was a J. Paul Getty associate at the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, Santa Monica, in 1991-1992.
Craig Potton Publishing published his first monograph in 2002 in association with Gow Langsford Gallery (Auckland), which includes essays by John Yau and Wystan Curnow.
"Max Gimblett: The Brush of All Things", a major survey of his work, opened at the Auckland Art Gallery Toi O Tamaki, Auckland, New Zealand in 2004 and traveled to the City Gallery, Wellington. Thomas McEvilley and Wystan Curnow contributed essays to the catalog, which also contained an interview with Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett.
"Here is how it happened. Gimblett stepped up to the 80 inch circular canvas and while that murderous train bore down on him, he painted The Wheel in less than one minute. This is no exaggeration, in on rapturous, fearless moment, which left him with time to spare." Wystan Curnow describes Gimblett painting The Wheel, an Enso, in his essay An Exhilaration of the Spirit, in Max Gimblett, monograph, 2002, published by Craig Potton Publishing in association with Gow Langsford Gallery, also including an essay by John Yau.
In January 2006 Max Gimblett took refuge in the precepts of Buddha.
"Gimblett’s absorption in Asian art connects him to three unique figures in American art: Morris Graves, John McLaughlin, and Ad Reinhardt," writes Yau, "One reason Gimblett shares a deep connection with these three seminal figures is because all of them embarked upon an intense and prolonged study of different schools of Buddhism and Buddhist art."
He was appointed to the honorary position of Visiting Professor of Art to the National Institute of Creative Arts and Industries, Auckland University, Auckland, New Zealand in 2003.
Gimblett was the Laila Foundation Artist in Residence at HuiPress, Maui, HI in July 2008, making a suite of Enso etchings.
His work was included in the Guggenheim Museum’s exhibition titled "The Third Mind: American Artists Contemplate Asia, 1860 to 1989" which was open from 30 January to 19 April 2009. The exhibition was curated by Alexandra Munroe, the museum’s first Senior Curator of Asian Art.
Gimblett has collaborated with a number of other artists including Warwick Freeman, Lewis Hyde, Judith Ivory, Matt Jones (artist), Win Knowlton, Alan Loney, Chris Martin, Eileen Tabios, Michael Dai Ryu Wenger Great Dragon, and John Yau.

Dan McCorquodale (born December 17, 1934 in Longville, Louisiana) is an American politician from Newton, Texas, a former California State Senator, and a member of the Democratic Party.
Early career.
Before entering politics, McCorquodale was a teacher in the California public schools. McCorquodale then served as a Santa Clara County Supervisor, winning election in 1972 and being reelected in 1976 and 1980.
State Senate.
In 1982 McCorquodale was elected to the San Jose based 12th district in the California State Senate, narrowly defeating Republican incumbent Dan O'Keefe.
Defeat.
In 1986, he won a difficult reelection against Santa Clara County Supervisor Tom Legan. Although he won easy reelection in 1990, McCorquodale lost his seat in 1994 to Dick Monteith a conservative Republican businessman. The fact that his senate district had been shifted from his home base of San Jose into the more conservative Central Valley after reapportionment proved too much of a burden for McCorquodale. And the huge gains the GOP enjoyed that year eventually did him in.

Circolo Speleologico Romano

The Circolo Speleologico Romano (CSR) is an Italian, non-profit speleological organization dedicated to the exploration, research, and conservation of caves. The CSR is one of the oldest caving groups in Italy. Its activity has contributed to the birth and the increase of the Italian Speleology 
history.
The Circolo Speleologico Romano (CSR) was founded on the 5th of July 1904 by Guido Cora, the illustrious geographer and brave mountain climber, Baron Carlo Franchetti, Alessandro Datti and others. Immediately the CSR established relationships with other European groups, especially Swiss, French and Belgium sharing the exploration of the Abruzzo region (Luppa’s cave, Val de Varri’s Cave) and in France. The first major exploration campaigns outside Italy, of the Anatolia caves, began after the First World War leading to important biological discoveries. In this period the bio-spelological activity received a strong acceleration especially due to the two associates Patrizi and Cerruti. More than 200 new species of troglobites carry the name of CSR associates. Since the beginning of the exploration activity all the data collected about each cave has been organized in the cave cadastre. In the 90s the regional cave cadastre was passed to the Federazione speleologica del Lazio. In 1924 the club published its first bulletin, detailing the explorations and the scientific activities of its associates. This bulletin (renamed Notiziario del Circolo Speleologico Romano in 1946) is exchanged with the publications of similar organizations in more than 40 nations around the world, continually expanding the social library of the association. In 1954 for its merits in scientific field, to the fulfilment of its 50 year of activity, the CSR was named "Ente Morale" by decree of the President of the Italian Republic Luigi Einaudi.
In the 1960s the CSR began to mount large international expeditions (1962 Gouffre Berger in France, 1963 in Lebanon, in 1964 Ojo Guareña in Spain and then Poland, Turkey, Albania. Since 1969 its research in Chiapas (southern Mexico) has been particularly relevant, where it has explored and surveyed more than 60 km of new caves. The bio-speleological results of these activities are published in three volumes of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei with the title “Subterranean Fauna of Mexico”.
To commemorate the 100th year of activity of the Circolo Speleologico Romano Poste Italiane has produced a special stamp in 3.5 million of pieces.

Ruth Pearce

Ruth Pearce is a fictional character in the soap opera "Doctors". She is played by Selina Chilton and made her first appearance on 18 April 2008. Ruth left the practice, and country, on 17 December 2010, but last appeared on 4 January 2011.
Storylines.
Ruth made her first appearance in April 2008 as the receptionist of the Campus Surgery at the University of Letherbridge. The Mill Practice Manager, Julia Parsons was impressed with Ruth's attitude and determination to stick with the job when it became clear that the rest of the campus staff were beginning to abandon their posts. She has since been taken on full-time by Julia and can sometimes be seen at The Mill. She is known for her past mental health problems and for becoming over involved in the problems of other members of staff and patients. When she was experiencing the height of her mental health problems she alienated her colleagues Michelle and Daniel, Michelle Corrigan by pretending to be her, and eventually nearly killing a patient whilst believing she was a nurse, and Daniel Granger by telling the mother of his child about his unsavory past. Ruth became close friends with her colleague Michelle Corrigan. Michelle was there for Ruth when she was subjected to the abusive bullying of her ex-boyfriend and helped her to become more confident and stronger to finally leave him for good.
Ruth began to show signs of mental illness and hearing voices when she started to believe she was to blame for the death of her twin sister Vicky who was stillborn. This, and the fact that her mother blamed her for the death and for being the 'stronger twin' was a major contributing factor to Ruth's declining mental health into adulthood. Ruth whilst ill then started a relationship with her friend Michelle's half brother (who Michelle had briefly had a relationship with not knowing they were related) who did not know she was ill, or that she worked with Michelle. She led him to believe that she was a nurse. The relationship came to light when Michelle discovered that Ruth had impersonated her on a number of occasions. For this and other issues Ruth was sectioned under the mental health act. Michelle was very angry with Ruth and vowed never to speak to her again despite being told that it was down to Ruth's condition rather than malice. 
Ruth's mental health problems and her road to recovery were well documented and showed Ruth's recovery from her illness at The Beeches treatment centre where she met a friend 'Smithy'. Once it was deemed that Ruth was well enough to be discharged she initially went to live with her estranged father who then abandoned her, and eventually with Julia Parsons the practice manager of The Mill Health Centre. Here she recovered well from her illness and soon began working back at The Mill despite a great deal of hostility from some members of staff who feared her because she was 'crazy'. This soon passed when Ruth proved that despite her mental health condition she was still able to do her job well. She and Michelle became friends again once Michelle understood the condition better, after becoming depressed and abusing alcohol herself. 
Ruth soon moved out of Julia's and into her own flat, where she lived independently until the return of Smithy in April 2010 who quickly moved in with her after being discharged from The Beeches and not being allowed home to his parents. It soon became clear he was not taking his medication and after a standoff on a roof Smithy was once again detained under the mental health act for his own safety. She started to show signs of a possessive nature towards Michelle, of fear of losing her friend and being on her own. In September 2008, Michelle began seeing new Practise Nurse, Mike Kelsey. As the couple began to get closer, Ruth was starting to feel left out. In order to stay close with Michelle, Ruth started to flirt with Mike when Michelle was watching in order to make her think he was capable of cheating. Mike and Michelle eventually split and he left The Mill for good.
Over the course of Series 10 this fear appeared to become an obsession. Eventually she began stealing items of Michelle's clothes, re-telling anecdotes about nursing that Michelle had previously told to her, and telling people she didn't know that she was a nurse. Ruth even tracked down Michelle's half brother (and ex-boyfriend), Adam, and began a relationship with him. This came to a head in the final episode of the 10th series in which Ruth's obsession appeared to completely take over as she had started to believe that she really was Michelle. At the beginning of the eleventh series Ruth was sectioned under The Mental Health Act for potentially being a danger to herself and others. Good friend and colleague Dr. Melody Bell was the doctor who recommended the sectioning after what appeared to be a psychotic break. She was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and hospitalised, with parts of episodes focusing on her experiences on the ward.
Ruth was eventually released from The Beeches. She went back home where her dad stayed with her for a few days but couldn't cope and left. Ruth then moved in with Julia Parsons, doing odd jobs and going to the shops for her. Ruth passed Melody's assessment and was offered her old job back, much to the disappointment of many of her colleagues, mainly Michelle. On Thursday 10 September 2009, Ruth had a relapse at the campus surgery. Heston took her back to Julia's house, who was away on holiday, so he stayed overnight with her. It was revealed Ruth had stopped taking her medication because she 'thought she was getting better'. Heston makes sure she takes her pills the next morning and she shows signs of improvement. Ruth made the decision to leave Letherbridge and England to go and work in Boston, USA for former Letherbridge GP Dr. Joe Fenton. She left on 18 December 2010 and flew out to start her new life, leaving behind bad memories as a child and as an adult. Ruth was last seen on a web-chat with Julia Parsons talking about her new life in the States.

Ruwanga Samath

Ruwanga Samath (born January 29, 1985), also known as Ru, is a Sri Lankan record producer and the president of The Bird Call Productions. Ru has lived in Los Angeles, CA since December 1997.
Biography.
Early life.
Ruwanga was born in Sri Lanka. His mother, “Renuka” was a popular Sri Lankan musician. Growing up, Ru was constantly around his mother’s events and picked up her love for music. At a young age he started experimenting with the piano, drums, and several other instruments, and found great joy in composing his own music. Due to the country’s unstable political atmosphere the family felt it was best to leave and moved to Pasadena, CA when Ru was 12. Ru attended Elliot Middle School and then John Muir High School for two years before moving to La Verne, California, and graduating from Bonita High School. After High School, Ru attended Cal State San Bernardino while continuing to work on his music. He found that demand for his music continued to grow and subsequently made the decision to leave school and focus full-time on his craft.
Career.
Since starting the Bird Call Productions in 2003 Ru has done songs for various major artists including Beyoncé Knowles' “Ring the Alarm” remix, Britney Spears’ “Break the ice” remix, Kelly Rowland’s “Work” remix, The Virgins' "Rich Girls" remix, Flo Rida, Ke$ha, and Girlicious.
His work has also been featured in television shows such as Discovery channel's Battleground Earth: Ludacris Vs. Tommy Lee, and movies such as "Saw IV". The song “Just Another Day”, from Saw IV’s digital soundtrack earned Ru an L.A. Music Award for best rock song in a film. The highly anticipated Sony Video Game “The Agency” features another one of Ru’s song which was just nominated for a Hollywood Music Award. Ru also composed and produced the compelling hip hop soundtrack for the 2007 indie documentary “Doubletime”.
2011.
2011 has started fast for Ruwanga, as he continues to make his mark on the music scene by continuing to work on many high profile projects. So far in 2011, Ru has already done songs for Morgan Spurlock's "Greatest Movie ever Sold", the song entitled "CameraBuggin" features Big Boi from the legendary Outkast, as well as Matt & Kim.

The Anon

Anon was one of two bands made up of pupils from Charterhouse School in Surrey, members of which went on to form the progressive rock band Genesis with another band from the same school, called Garden Wall. The band formed in May 1965 and split up in December 1966. It originally consisted of Rivers Jobe (bass), Richard MacPhail (vocals), Anthony Phillips (lead guitar), and Rob Tyrell (drums). They were later joined by future Genesis guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford on rhythm guitar. During a short period of time, Rutherford was forced to leave the band by his house master at Charterhouse and was replaced by Mike Colman.
History.
The band was originally formed when Anthony Phillips met up with Rivers Jobe. The two had been friends in prep school and had been in a band called The Spiders whilst they had been at prep school. The Spiders had been a Beatles type band, and when Phillips entered Charterhouse in April 1965, he hooked up with his old friend and formed The Anon with Rob Tyrell and Richard MacPhail within a week. The band's name was short for "anonymous".
Just after The Anon had formed, a young guitarist called Mike Rutherford, who had been at Charterhouse since November 1964, heard that there was a chance he would be let into the band as a rhythm guitarist. He met up with and befriended Phillips and MacPhail, passed an audition and was subsequently given a place in the band.
Anon was dedicated to covering songs by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and rhythm and blues music from that era, like John Mayall. The only recording the band ever made was the only original song that the band had during this period, a demo of a song called 'Pennsylvania Flickhouse' written by Anthony Phillips.
The members of Anon and Garden Wall were seen as the rebels of the school, as Charterhouse offered an extensive range of activities for pupils, but the members of the bands chose to play music. All music except for classical music was frowned upon by the teachers in the school. The members of The Anon used to have their hair longer than everyone else and go down to the local pubs as a sign of rebellion. As a result, the band suffered a lot of pressure from their parents and teachers, and this led to MacPhail departing the band because of his parents' attitude to him being in a rock band (leaving Rutherford to take over as singer), and Rutherford leaving the group because his guitar was confiscated by his house master. Rutherford was replaced by a returning Richard MacPhail and guitarist Mike Colman, with Colman departing shortly thereafter and Rutherford returning to the fold.
The band continued to go on with the five-piece lineup until July 1966, when Rivers Jobe and Richard MacPhail were scheduled to leave Charterhouse. MacPhail decided that his band should do a concert with Garden Wall both as top acts and with a third band opening, so The Anon set about getting together a concert that was staged within the school. The event marked the end of the five-piece lineup, and Jobe and MacPhail both quit the band. Jobe went on to join Savoy Brown, MacPhail went on to become a sound engineer for Genesis until 1973.
The band, now only Phillips, Rutherford (who took on Macphail's duties whilst Jobe went unreplaced), and Tyrell, carried on. Eventually Tyrell left, leading the band to break up in December 1966. Phillips and Rutherford then went on to join with all three members of Garden Wall (vocalist Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks, and drummer Chris Stewart) in 1967, to form Genesis (with Mike buying his first bass), in January 1967.

Garden Wall (band)

Garden Wall were a band from Charterhouse School in Surrey that went on to merge with the remains of another band from the same school, The Anon to form the progressive rock band Genesis in 1967. The band were formed around May 1965, consisted of Peter Gabriel (vocals), Tony Banks (keyboards), and Chris Stewart (drums).
History.
The band formed in May 1965, although it had its roots back in September 1963 when Tony Banks and Peter Gabriel both entered Charterhouse. Both lads did not like the school for their first year there, and as arriving at the same time, they stuck together throughout the first year. It did not take long for them to discover their common passion of music. This led the two of them to going into the nearby towns and villages and listening to whatever music would be playing in the record stores at the time. The two lads were members of the Duckites house at Charterhouse, and there was a piano in the main hall which they used to go and play on. These occasions in the main hall were the first musical collaborations between Banks and Gabriel.
During his time at Charterhouse, Peter Gabriel had been drumming for an R & B band called "The Spoken Word", and another band called "Millords". As a result of his time in this band, Peter started songwriting with Tony Banks. The first song the two of them ever wrote together eventually evolved into a track called 'She Is Beautiful', and eventually became known as 'The Serpent' (released on Genesis' debut album From Genesis to Revelation, in 1969).
In May 1965, when future Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips had joined the school, a five-piece band called "The Anon" had come into existence. It was around this time that Peter and Tony got together with Ant's friend Chris Stewart (who was not a member of The Anon), and together they formed a three-piece band featuring Peter on vocals, Tony on piano, and Chris on drums. This band named itself Garden Wall. The band simply carried on like this, playing covers and new songs that Tony and Peter were writing together.
In July 1966, Garden Wall played their only concert, on a stage inside Charterhouse School on a double bill with The Anon. Gabriel showered the audience with rose petals that he had spent the afternoon picking, this was to be the first of his famous onstage antics.
Garden Wall's fellow band splintered at this point, with two of the members leaving in the summer and a third member leaving towards the end of the year. This left Anthony Phillips and Mike Rutherford, the band's two guitarists, who then joined all three of the members of the Garden Wall in 1967 to form Genesis.

William Frederick James Harvey

William Frederick James Harvey DFC & Bar MC MBE, (8 January 1897, Portslade, Sussex – 21 July 1972) was a British flying ace in World War I credited with twenty-six victories. He was the first recipient of the DFC & Bar and was also awarded the MC.
Involvement in World War I.
Harvey served with the Signal Company of the Royal Engineers until he transferred to the RFC in December 1916. In December 1917 he was posted as a pilot to No. 22 Squadron flying Bristol F.2B fighters. His first air victory, a downed Pfalz D.III, was recorded 16 March 1918, followed by an Albatros D.V two days later.
With three more kills in March Harvey established himself as a flying ace. In May 1918 he was promoted to captain and commanded 'B' Flight. In the last decade of May Harvey, flying with Lt. George Thomas as his flight observer, downed two observation balloons and four German airplanes; on 20 June he downed three enemy airplanes. Shortly after this success Thomas was replaced with Captain Dennis Waight, who remained Harvey's teammate until the end of campaign. The crew scored 9 kills during the Battle of Amiens in August 1918.
Of his twenty-six victories (comprising 3 balloons, 12 and 2 shared destroyed, and 9 'out of control') credited to Harvey, eighteen were achieved utilising his front gun.
Later Military Service.
After the war, Harvey served as an instructor with 33 TD Squadron of the Army of the Rhine. On leaving the RAF he became a farmer. During the Second World War he was awarded the MBE for his service. When the war ended he retired to Kent, writing many aviation-related articles and the history of his old RAF Squadron, No. 22, entitled 'Pi in the Sky'.
Harvey married Mary Gurdon, sister of his squadron mate John Everard Gurdon, in 1920.
Honours and awards.
"As a fighting pilot this officer has the real offensive spirit regardless of personal danger. He has destroyed several enemy machines whilst fighting against superior numbers."
"A brilliant fighting pilot, who has proved himself a capable leader in many offensive patrols. During the August operations he personally accounted for seven enemy machines and, in company with another pilot, destroyed an eighth, displaying courage and tenacity of high order."

List of Robotech vehicles

This article is a list of all of the vehicles in the anime "Robotech".
Mecha.
Cyclone.
The Cyclone Veritech Ride Armor is a fictional powered armor derived from the VR series Ride Armor designed by ARTMIC's Shinji Aramaki for the Japanese anime series "Genesis Climber Mospeada". For many fans the Cyclone is the signature design of "Robotech" 's Third Generation and "Mospeada".
Background.
The Cyclone is definitely the most innovative design in multiform mecha since the renovation of the SDF-1. The Cyclone is a tough, durable piece of hardware that maximizes the versatility, survivability, and lethality of an individual soldier. The weapons systems are modular, accurate, and flexible, and the motorcycle mode is unmatched in its role. In all, one can expect to see more mecha like this in the future.
In vehicle mode, the various models of Cyclone resemble mundane if slightly futuristic motorcycles, but with a flick of a switch the Cyclone unfolds and attaches to the rider's CVR-3 armor, or Riding Suit in "Mospeada", and combines to encase the wearer in powered armor, providing greatly increased protection, agility and firepower on such a small scale as to be previously unheard of in the Robotech Wars.
An already small vehicle, the Cyclone can fold into a boxed shape configuration for storage purposes, and in this shape it small enough to be carried aboard the VFA-6 Alpha Fighter in a compartment behind the cockpit as an emergency combat vehicle for downed pilots. 
Apart from the internal missile racks of the "VR-041 Saber" and auto cannon on the Shadow Dancer, all Cyclone weaponry is attached externally either on hardpoints on its forearms or wielded by the pilot. This means all Cyclone weaponry are interchangeable and usable on any model, excluding specialized weapons exclusive to the Devastator and Shadow Dancer.
While not directly intended as such, the Cyclone was the perfect mecha for the post-Invid invaded Earth. The Cyclone's success can be appreciated in the fact that the CVR-3 armor required in its use has become the pilot suit and infantry armor for the REF forces.
Gakken made very famous toy versions of the Cyclone which are fragile and rare. Starting in 2007, Toynami made Masterpiece versions of all four Cyclone models similar to their Valkyries and Alphas.
Cyclone Series Mecha.
VR-038 Bartley: A lighter model of Cyclone primarily intended for reconnaissance use, the Bartley increases the normal Cyclone's speed and agility in exchange for decreased armor.
The VR-038L variant carries a rocket launcher, carrying six rounds in a top-mounted magazine. A shoulder-fired weapon for normal infantry, when used by a Cyclone its clamped to the right forearm plate and can be fired one-handed.
The Bartley is used by Houquet en Rose in "Mospeada" and her "Robotech" counterpart Rook Bartley. The name of the mecha appears to have influenced the character's name during translation. The mecha is also seen in use by Sue Graham in "Robotech", armed with a video camera instead of a weapon and featuring the black paint job used by the Jupiter Group forces.
VR-041 Saber: A special ops mobile suit, the Saber was equipped with retractable vibroblades in the arm mounted CAD's. For extra firepower the front of the cyclone (chest in soldier mode) mount 6 mini-missiles each. 
The Saber is used by Yellow Belmont (Mospeada)/Lancer (Robotech).
The VR-041 is known as the in "Mospeada", a homage to the classic English Brough Superior ("Brough" pronounced like "rough") motorcycles. 
VR-052 Battler: The Battler serves a dual role as a model issued to infantry forces as well as emergency vehicle for use by downed pilots, both features ensuring it is the most commonly available model. The default color scheme is bare gray metal, though the Jupiter Group sported their preferred dark gray/black paint job. Lacking the Saber's internal missile racks but featuring more armor than the Bartley, the Battler is the standard model of Cyclone.
The standard issue intended for infantry use is armed with a large beam rifle. Without a Cyclone the rifle is a heavy squad support weapon, but when used by the mecha it can be wielded like a rifle or even fired one handed.
Known as the VR-052 MOSPEADA Ride Armor in the Japanese anime series Genesis Climber Mospeada. 
VR-055 Devastator: Intended as a portable heavy weapon variant of the Cyclone concept, the Devastator carries a large double-barreled rapid fire pulse particle gun mounted on its shoulder, a trio of GR-10 rockets on each lower leg, a triple mini-missile rack on the right forearm plate with a double-barreled pulse beam gun mounted on the left forearm plate.
All these weapons make the Devastator as powerful as a squad normal Battlers, but comes at the expense of the Cyclone's famed agility and speed. The Devastator also requires the operator to be wearing the modified heavier CVR-4 armor to use it.
Originally only existing as an unrealized design published in the "ARTMIC Design Works" book, and having never appeared in either Robotech or Mospeada, the VR-055 became an official design with its inclusion in the video game, even if the video game version only vaguely resembles the original. The fact it was designed by the creators of original series has meant the Devastator is less looked down upon than equally overly armed designs the fan-created Shadow Dancer, but many fans refuse to still consider it a true design because it never appeared in the TV series. 
VR-101P Shadow Dancer: The newest Cyclone design's main claim to fame is the inclusion of a Shadow cloaking device, making it undetectable by the Invid. The Shadow Dancer is armed with modified CAD saber forearm plates that integrate the twin forearm mini-missile Launchers of the VR-052F, as well as a reflex auto-cannon mounted interally on right-hand side of torso.
Originally a fan-design created for use in the Robotech Role-Playing Game and published in "Protoculture Addicts" back in their Robotech fanzine days, the Shadow Dancer has become an official design or near enough to it with its appearance in the "" video game. The inclusion of a Shadow cloaking device on such a small mecha along with all its weaponry meant many "Robotech" fans consider it to be perfect example of a munchkin design, and many fans still refuse to acknowledge a design that hasn't appeared in the series.
Other Variants
There have been quick appearances of other Cyclone models in various comics, with enough differences to be considered new models such as the Jupter Base Cyclone seen in "Robotech: Class Reunion". Also Prelude to the "Shadow Chronicles" and early images from the "Shadow Chronicles" seem to imply both new weaponry and at least one new model of Cyclone.
VHT-1 Veritech Hover Tank.
The VHT-1 Veritech Hover Tank is a fictional transformable mecha from the anime series Robotech, based upon the ATAC-SCA-01 Spartas of Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross. It was the backbone of the Army of the Southern Cross (ASC), operated exclusively by its Alpha Tactical Armored Corps (ATAC). Significantly smaller than the larger RDF destroids, the VHT was also faster and more suited to combat within urban environments, a considerable priority for the Southern Cross given its mission of planetary defense. 
Highly mobile and heavily armored, the VHT carried impressive firepower that also reflected a general trend among Southern Cross engineers to favor energy and automatic projectile weapons over missiles (which remained popular among REF engineers. In tank mode, the VHT was capable of traversing almost any terrain, including jumping obstacles as required while maintaining a high speed. In this mode, its armament was limited to forward-facing blasts from the same weapon that would in battloid mode be its rifle; however, the true firepower of the VHT was most evident in its two-legged Gladiator mode (also called "Guardian" at least once in deference to the mecha's Robotech origins). Configured as a Gladiator, the VHT boasted both a large energy cannon and a tri-barrelled autocannon, between the two of which it could effectively target even heavily protected aerial targets. Indeed, some early victories of Southern Cross forces depended on this capability, with Gladiator-mode VHTs blasting Bioroids from their formidable antigravity platforms and hovertanks in Battloid mode engaging them on the ground while supported by fire from VHT autocannons.
In later months of the Second Robotech War, advances in technology and the need to take the battle to the Robotech Masters in space saw the addition to the VHT of enclosed, spaceworthy cockpits and thrusters for localized space maneuvering. At this time, the hovertank was also upgraded with improved targeting capabilities derived from Louis Nichols' Visual Trace Firing System (VTFS), colloquially known as the "Pupil Pistol." (The code was used without Nichols' approval, and he nearly burned out the cockpits of the tanks when he discovered it, relenting only when the alien clone Zor Prime explained to him that the killing it would bring about was necessary to end the war.) 
The Veritech Hovertank remained a mainstay of the Southern Cross forces even after the widespread deployment of the AGAC, and VHTs were instrumental in the infiltration and eventual destruction of the Masters' mothership in the battle that ended the Second Robotech War (though the concluding events of this war, like the others, were greatly dependent on the individual actions of a few people and not the collective military might of the overall Southern Cross). The timing of the final battle, however -- coming as it did alongside a final assault on Monument City by the remaining Masters' bioroids, assault carriers, and even civilian clones -- made the victory a phyrric one, leaving the Southern Cross forces depleted and the Earth once again in ruins. Those few hovertanks that survived this cataclysm were unable to present more than a token defense in the subsequent Invid Invasion that came a year later and ushered in the Third Robotech War.
VFH-10 Veritech AGAC.
The VFH-10 Armored Gyro Assault Chopper, designated "Ajax" upon its introduction, was the last mecha series developed by the Army of the Southern Cross in both the anime television series Robotech and its original Japanese source The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross. An advanced space-combat fighter based on a helicopter concept, the AGAC was the mainstay of all Southern Cross assaults against the Robotech Masters once the Southern Cross began fleet operations.
Unlike the earlier VF-8 Logan, the AGAC was designed with space combat in mind and proved particularly adept in that arena. Its helicopter mode was intended to give it atmospheric capabilities as well; in practice, these did not prove particularly important given the timing of its introduction, which coincided with humanity's transition from a defensive posture to an offensive one that placed emphasis on engaging the Masters in space. 
The AGAC boasted considerably improved firepower over the Logan and was considered a significant rival to the heavy armament of the Veritech Hovertank, in part because of its reintegration of missiles (whose area-affecting damage potential was less of a problem for combat operations in space than would be true in a cityscape). It also featured multiple banks of thrusters to maximize maneuverability in a vacuum, making it far less dependent upon the linear fighting tactics of earlier veritech fighters like the Logan and VF-1 Valkyrie whose powerful forward-thrust engines led pilots to mimic atmospheric flight.
Large numbers of AGACs were produced in the wake of early successes, and they continued to replace earlier space fighters and the Logan in Southern Cross squadrons even after the Second Robotech War ended. Declining production capabilities in the wake of the destruction of Monument City resulted in much slower replenishment after the war than had been true at its heydey, however, and those AGACs that were in service when the Invid arrived were far too few to hold off the invaders.
VFB-9 Beta.
The VFB-9 Beta Fighter is a Veritech fighter-bomber in the fictional universe of Robotech. 
The VFB-9 Beta Fighter is based on the AB-01 Tread Armo-Bomber from the anime series Genesis Climber Mospeada. It is a large aerospacecraft capable of making orbit on the brute-force power of its three huge rocket engines. The VBF-9 is rather unaerodynamic, flying on the "brick with giant engines" principle. Its huge size and slender wings give it an extremely high wing loading, degrading its performance further - in terms of combat use, the Beta is a giant missile truck and little more in fighter configuration. In Battloid mode, the Beta is a hulking, powerful combatant with an impressive array of weapons including three heavy beam guns in each forearm and several missile launchers. The Beta's third configuration is a VTOL and walking configuration.
The Beta has the unique ability to dock with an Alpha Fighter (the AFC-01 Legioss Armo-Fighter in Mospeada), combining the two into a larger combat unit. The Beta fighter provides additional fuel for a docked Alpha and gives it the necessary thrust for reaching orbit. Beta Fighters were used as unmanned boosters for their smaller Alpha brethren.
In older references that are now considered secondary continuity, the VFB-9 was referred to as the "VBF-1" Beta Fighter.
The Beta was preceded in service by the SFA-5 Conbat, of which very little is known. This fighter, originally called AF-03 Convert in Mospeada, is the Armo-Fighter predecessor of the Legioss that was used in an earlier campaign (along with the AS-C03 Condor), and it could transform into Armo-Soldier mode. 
VF-8 Logan.
VF-8 Logan Veritech Fighter was a fictional transformable fighter from the animated television series "Robotech", based upon the TASC-SCF-02 Logan of "The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross" anime series.
According to the current "Robotech" continuity, the Army of the Southern Cross (ASC) consigned the Logan as its primary Veritech fighter during the ASC's growth as the frontline defense force for Earth with the departure of the Pioneer Mission. The arrival of the Robotech Masters ignited the Second Robotech War and pressed the Logan into combat. The Logan proved ineffective in air and space battles against the forces of the Robotech Masters and during the war, the Logan was supplanted and eventually replaced by the more powerful and versatile VFH-10 Veritech AGAC Veritech Fighter.
The Logan used a triple-barreled cannon, a laser gunpod, but had no projectile-based guns. Its production design showed the ability of mounting two medium range missiles (unseen in the animation). The VF-8's fighter configuration is an extremely cramped design, with a stubby, bulbous nose, very large maneuvering thrusters, no visible air intakes, and a pair of small, highly loaded, unswept wings with a minor taper from root to tip. Also, this Veritech fighter differed from other mecha of this class by having only two modes: the normal Fighter mode and a Guardian mode. The second mode is called Guardian in the animation itself, but called Battloid on the Robotech.com website. (The second mode is called GERWALK or "Flying Walker" mode in "The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross" anime series.)
VFA-6 Alpha.
The Alpha Veritech - designation VFA-6 - is a fictional transforming aerospace strike fighter used in the Robotech universe. 
The VFA-6 Alpha Fighter's design is borrowed from the AFC-01 Legioss Armo-Fighter in the Japanese series Genesis Climber Mospeada. The VF-X-6 Genia prototype of the Alpha was developed with another Veritech fighter design, the Condor, and the two share very strong visual similarities. By the time the Robotech Expeditionary Force departed in 2022, Alpha Veritechs could combine with the VF-X-7 Beta Veritech prototype. The VF-X-6 project was developed slowly through the early teens as an alternate to the then-favored YF-4; when the YF-4 project ended the Robotech Defense Force pushed the VFA-6 into high gear while the Army of the Southern Cross pressed their weight behind the VF-8 Logan Veritech Fighter and VHT-1 Spartas Veritech Hover Tank. In REF service the fighter quickly matured into a powerful and flexible aerospace strike fighter, capable of toting large weapons loads into battle. Several mission-specific models were developed and procured.
Variants.
By 2044, the Alpha is seen in several models:
Most models of the Alpha have a heavy missile armament of sixty short-range missiles which it complements with the three-barreled beam cannon. The Shadow Fighters replace this with a bulky disruptor cannon, called a 'Destabilizer', which they use to breach Invid force fields. It has a maximum speed of 3000–3250 km/h at high altitude and requires the assistance of the VFB-9 Beta to transit into space.
In the fictional world of Robotech, the VFA-6 remains operational as of the last known date in the storyline (circa 2044).
The VFA-6 Alpha was preceded in service by the VF-1 Valkyrie.
The Alpha served on Earth during the timeframe of the Third Robotech War.
VF-1 Valkyrie.
In the fictional series Macross and its English adaptation Robotech, the first mass-produced variable fighter (Macross) or Veritech fighter (Robotech) is called the VF-1 Valkyrie, although the exact name varies by Valkyrie model. 
The VF-1 was initially designed by the legendary Japanese mecha designer Shoji Kawamori (with contributions by his Studio Nue partner Kazutaka Miyatake) in 1980-1982 to be the centerpiece mecha design of the anime series The Super Dimension Fortress Macross (1982–1983). 
In Robotech, the VF-1 is most commonly referred to as the "Veritech Fighter", which is short for Variable Engineering and Robotic Integration TECHnology, but its official popular name "Valkyrie" is used in a few infrequent references.
Veritech fighter.
The Veritech fighter (occasionally misspelled as Varitech) is a fictional fighter aircraft can transform into combat walking machine in "Robotech". In the late '90s, an official backronym was invented by Harmony Gold USA for the term "Veritech:" Variable Engineering and Robotic Integration TECHnology. The name is derived from variable fighter, the term for transforming fighters used in "The Super Dimension Fortress Macross" (the series from which the first part of "Robotech" was adapted). Veritech is sometimes abbreviated "VT," though mostly in the Jack McKinney novel adaptations.
The nomenclature for Veritech Fighters partially follows that established in the 20th century by the US Armed Forces. "V" is added to the beginning of the fighter's designation to stand for "Variable" or "Veritech."
Any vehicle that is considered or referred to as Veritech, has transformable machine forms that it can assume. Using VF-1 Valkyrie as example: They are Fighter Mode, Guardian Mode (Half-fighter/Half-Robot) & Battloid/Robot Mode. 
There are non-flying veritech type mecha in Robotech universe. A canon example is the VHT-1 Spartas Veritech Hover Tank seen in "Robotech"'s 2nd season named "Southern Cross Saga".
Spaceships.
Garfish-class Light Cruiser.
The Garfish class cruisers - designation SDS - or Garfish class Super Dimensional Cruiser is a fictional Spaceship used in the Robotech universe. The Garfish class Super Dimensional Cruiser is derived from the Garfish class Super Dimensional Scout Cruiser in the Japanese series Genesis Climber Mospeada. The SCS-01 Garfish prototype was developed just after the departure of the SDF-3 Pioneer during the Campaign, and it entered service with the Robotech Expeditionary Forces (REF) in 2026. In REF service the class of cruisers quickly matured into a powerful and flexible platform, capable of toting large weapons loads, mecha, and/or personal into battle. Several mission-specific models were developed and procured.
Tristar-class Cruiser.
The "Tristar"-class cruiser was a common medium fleet starship in the fictional "Robotech" universe, one of the few classes of vessel that was shared between both the Robotech Expeditionary Force and the Army of the Southern Cross. The class leader, the "Tristar", was Major General Rolf Emerson's flagship during the Second Robotech War, and was destroyed when she rammed a Robotech Masters' Mother-ship.
"Tristar", like most capital ships of its era, resembled a large submarine and was designed to be based on a planet. Its size is only a little greater than that of an oceanic aircraft carrier. Its primary weapons are retractable into the hull of the ship and then fired off they need to do so.
Ikazuchi-class Carrier (Large Cruiser).
The Ikazuchi-class Carrier (also referred to as a Large Cruiser) was developed during the 22-year mission of the Robotech Expeditionary Force. Approximately 40 "Ikazuchi" carriers were involved in the Battle of Reflex Point in July 2044 (as depicted in the Third Robotech Saga and ) during which the REF launched a full-scale assault against the Invid on Earth. The carriers served as mobile bases and launchers for the thousands of VFA-6 Alpha and VFB-9 Beta fighters involved in the battle. Each "Ikazuchi" carrier can serve as a base for hundreds of fighters that can be launched from six quick response bays. For defense, they are equipped with eight triple beam cannon turrets and eight single barrel point defense cannons. For the battle, the "Ikazuchi" carriers also served as launchers for the Neutron-S missiles. Some carriers are apparently equipped with powerful Syncro-Cannons, although they appear not to be used in the Battle of Reflex Point (but were later referred to in the battle against the Haydonites).
With a main hull length of over 600 metres (2000 feet), the "Ikazuchi" carriers are the largest capital ships in the REF fleet after the Super Dimension Fortresses.
During the battle of Reflex Point, as depicted in , the Ikazuchis successfully launch the REF's entire complement of fighters quickly and effectively. However, when the Invid fighters overwhelm the REF fighters, they begin launching attacks on the Carriers. Despite their heavy armor and weapons, the sheer number of Invid fighters causes at least three Ikazuchis to be destroyed (an REF officer directly observes this fact in reporting, "Sir! Three cruisers wiped out!") and many more to be damaged. The damaged Ikazuchis subsequently returned to Space Station Liberty for repairs - at least five more were lost when the Haydonites attacked Liberty.
The name 'Ikazuchi' (雷, ""Thunder"") was also the name given to this ship class in the original Genesis Climber Mospeada, from which the third Robotech Saga was adapted.
Specifications
Shimakaze-class Battlecruiser.
The Shimakaze (島風, "Island Wind") battlecruisers were first introduced in and the . Slightly larger than the earlier "Tristar"-class ships, the Shimakazes primary weapon is a large forward mounted syncro-cannon. The "Icarus", commanded by Captain Vince Grant is one of five "Shimakaze" battlecrusiers seen in the movie. The other four are seen with the SDF-4 at the beginning of the Battle of Reflex Point, in which their large syncro-cannons are able to destroy a number of Invid Carriers before they can launch their fighters.
SDF-1.
The SDF-1 "Macross" is a fictional interstellar spacecraft from "The Super Dimension Fortress Macross", an anime series that aired in Japan in 1982–1983, and its American adaptation "Robotech" (1985). SDF (Super Dimension Fortress) is a reference to the ship being a maneuverable space fortress capable of space folds, or travelling in subspace for faster-than-light movement.
SDF-2.
In the fictional setting of "Robotech", the SDF-2 "Megalord" is the second Super Dimensional flagship of the United Earth Forces that was abruptly introduced offscreen in the dialogue of the 36th and final episode of "The Macross Saga" segment.
Limited only to existing footage of the SDF-1, a new SDF-2 is never seen and presumed destroyed with the SDF-1 sometime during the Khyron's attack of New Macross City in 2014. Its surprise non-appearance and the ambiguity of its outcome has been an endless source of confusion and debate among Robotech fans.
The Robotech comic adaptation by Comico depicts the SDF-2 as sitting back to back with SDF-1 in Lake Gloval. This was expanded upon in the Robotech novels by Jack McKinney. It is similar in appearance to SDF-1 and seems to have been intentionally built in the original ship's post-modular transformation mode. This is unusual given that the purpose for transformation in the original was due to circumstance, not design. However, the novel explains this was to facilitate the transfer of the engines from the SDF-1 to the SDF-2, although this never actually happens. Since the ship is visualized in the comics as being similar to the SDF-1 (though armed with ARMD class carriers), it is generally assumed to be a second "Macross"-class battlefortress.
According to the Robotech novels, some of its remains are buried at the three mounds that play a key part of the Second Robotech War. The rest of its components and materials were scavenged for the construction of the new SDF-3.
SDF-3.
The SDF-3 is the third Super Dimensional Fortress of the United Earth Forces, and was first introduced in ' (1986). In recent comics, it was identified by name as the Pioneer, and was rebuilt as a "Shadow Dimensional Fortress." It is commanded by Admiral Lisa Hunter, and later by her husband, Admiral Rick Hunter. In 2022, the SDF-3 was launched as the flagship of the Pioneer Expedition on a mission to find the Robotech Masters Homeworld to try and prevent another war on Earth. The mission, which would take many unexpected turns and face unimaginable challenges, would last 22 years.
History and background.
The SDF-1 and the newly built SDF-2 were both destroyed at the end of the First Robotech War in Khyron's final attack on New Macross City in January 2014. Construction of the SDF-3 began almost immediately using the salvaged remains of the ruined ships as well as technology taken from the captured Zentraedi Satellite factory. Construction, on board the Satellite factory, would take eight (8) years and would consume much of the resources of the Earth which was still struggling to rebuild after the Zentraedi holocaust of 2011 which devastated 95% of the surface and reduced the human population to only 70,000. 
Some military officials, most notably Commander Anatole Leonard of the Army of the Southern Cross, were angry about the construction and mission. The construction of the SDF-3 had stripped the Zentraedi Satellite Factory of almost all usable equipment (making it of little further use) and Earth had poured so much into the SDF-3's construction that other military and weapon development projects had been put on hold. In addition, the departure of the SDF-3, which had been fitted with Earth's most advanced weapon systems, as well as over 10,000 of Earth's best soldiers (and their families), would greatly compromise the planet's ability to defend itself should another alien attack occur. Before the SDF-3 departed, Leonard warned on television that "Once the SDF leaves orbit I won't be able to defend the Earth against a flock of pigeons."
Despite the massive cost, it was believed that the SDF-3 would require every advantage possible as its mission would be long and dangerous and that the likelihood of another alien attack on Earth was low. However, circumstances would play out in a manner nobody expected: The Robotech Masters had already become aware of the protoculture on Earth and of the failure of their Zentraedi soldiers to retrieve it. In 2012, the Masters, in command of a spacefleet of six motherships, had departed from Tirol, their homeworld on a 15 year journey to Earth. When the SDF-3 arrived on Tirol, they found a planet that had been devastated by the Invid years earlier. The Robotech Expeditionary Force would use the SDF-3 as a base to help rebuild Tirol and help free over a dozen other worlds from Invid occupation, as well as to form alliances with other alien races against the Invid.
However, in a twist of irony, the Robotech Masters would arrive at Earth in 2029 and the Second Robotech War would begin between them and the United Earth Forces (UEF) and the Army of the Southern Cross. The war would last one year and lead to the destruction of the Masters' entire fleet and the devastation of Earth and its military forces. The SDF-3 ended up fighting a war it never expected to face while Earth would face the war the SDF-3's mission was supposed to prevent. The war, which led to the spread of the spores of the Invid flower of life across Earth, drew the Invid to the planet a year later. The Invid Invasion was quick and devastating as the Earth forces had exhausted themselves fighting the Masters. The Third Robotech war began as Earth would remain under Invid occupation for 13 years. Events would keep the SDF-3 away from Earth during both wars, until 2044 when it was to lead a final assault against the Invid on Earth.
Depiction in Robotech.
' depicted the SDF-3 under the final stages of construction within the giant Robotech factory in orbit around the Earth in the year 2022. Though human-engineered, the exterior is of Tirolian design, as part of the Pioneer expedition's strategy of infiltrating the Robotech Masters homeworld. The ship is introduced in the finished animation of ', but the launch is never seen because the rest of the series was never completed. The storyline is continued in a series of "Robotech" novels from Del Rey.
Reconstruction.
The sequel "" continues from both the end of the original "Robotech" television series and the unfinished The first issue of Wildstorm's 5-part prequel comic series "Robotech: Prelude to the Shadow Chronicles" shows the original version of the SDF-3 from the "Sentinels" video, but the ship is damaged and rebuilt as a "Shadow Dimensional Fortress" in later issues. This new look duplicates the general arrangement of the original SDF-1 design, but has a look more in the style of the larger ship designs from "Mospeada/Robotech: The New Generation", most specifically the SDF-4 (also referenced as the "Liberator"). This has been explained as a total systems rebuild, incorporating the shadow-cloaking system to evade Invid Protoculture sensors.
Mysterious disappearance.
In the final episode of the original "Robotech" series, audiences anticipated the return of the SDF-3, but were left hanging by its mysterious disappearance. Command of the returning Robotech Expeditionary Force was taken over by the SDF-4. Del Rey continued the story through the novel "The End of the Circle", to a mixed reception by fans who preferred to see the "Sentinels" story completed by Harmony Gold. 
In the movie "", it was revealed that the SDF-3 had been attempting to test-fire the new Neutron-S missiles. These malfunctioned badly as a result of design sabotage, seriously damaging the SDF-3 and the science vessel "Deukalion", and creating a black hole. The SDF-3 was immobilized and adrift near the new black hole. Captain Vince Grant and the "Icarus" attempted a rescue, but all three ships were attacked by hostile unknown forces, and Admiral Hunter ordered the "Icarus" to return to Earth with the "Deukalion" and deliver a warning about the Neutron-S missiles. The ultimate fate of the SDF-3 is unknown, as it was crippled and had just survived a ramming by a hostile warship when last seen.
At the conclusion of the movie, the starship "Ark Angel" is dispatched to find out what became of the ship and her crew, and recover survivors, if any.
SDF-4.
The SDF-4 (identified as both Izumo and Liberator) is the fourth Super Dimensional flagship of the United Earth Forces that was seen in the finale of the fictional "Robotech" universe. 
The 1985 Robotech series, the Robotech Legacy Collections, and the Robotech Protoculture Collection refer to the SDF-4 as the Izumo, which was the name of this vessel in the original "Genesis Climber Mospeada" anime series.
In the "Completing the Journey" endnotes to the ' comic series, "The Art of Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles", and the Collector's Edition DVD of ', the SDF-4 has been referred to as the Liberator.
History and background.
The last episode of the original "Robotech" series (1985) and the 2006 film presented the SDF-4 as leading the Robotech Expeditionary Force (REF) in its final assault to liberate the Earth from Invid alien occupation in July 2044. The SDF-4's commanding officer, General Gunther Reinhardt, is ordered by Admiral Rick Hunter to assemble all available REF forces at Moon base ALUCE for the attack. When the SDF-3 fails to return from a secret weapons test in the Omicron sector, Reinhardt assumes command and is forced to begin the attack. The SDF-4, along with the four Shimakaze battlecruisers, opens the battle with the firing of their massive Sycnro-cannon which destroy several Invid carriers before they can launch their fighters. They continue to provide cover fire while the REF fighter squadrons engage the Invid fighters. Despite their initial successes, the Invid's sheer numbers eventually overwhelm the REF fighters and soon the REF capital ships begin taking losses as Invid forces punch through the fleet's frontlines. Reinhardt is also informed that the ground assault by REF commandos and resistance fighters has stalled while still out of range of Reflex Point. With the ground offensive stalled and the REF fleet hopelessly outnumbered, General Reinhardt decides the only remaining option is to launch the Neutron-S missiles. The Neutron-S missiles, supplied by a highly advanced cybernetic race known as the Haydonites, were ordered by Admiral Hunter to be used as a weapon of last resort if the REF attack failed. 
While the Neutron-S missiles are more than powerful enough to destroy the central Invid hive at Reflex Point, they will also wipe out most, or possibly all life on Earth. The use of these "scorched earth" tactics was one of the most controversial of the Robotech Wars. Reinhardt makes the decision with the greatest reluctance, knowing full well that he is condemning the surviving humans and the REF troops on Earth to death and possibly rendering the planet permanently uninhabitable. However, like Admiral Hunter, the REF and the Sentinel races, Reinhardt knows that the Invid will continue to evolve on Earth and eventually threaten the Galaxy unless they are stopped.
As the Neutron-S missiles fly towards Earth, the Invid Regess, recognizing that true power of the missiles is to create micro-black holes, (which is as yet unknown to the REF) decides that Earth is no longer safe. She converts her entire race into pure energy, taking the shape of a giant phoenix, and flies off into space in search of a new planet on which to continue her race's evolution. As a final gift to her daughter Ariel, who has a human body and who chose to stay with the humans, the Regess destroys the Neutron-S missiles.
The SDF-4, after ordering all fighter squadrons to regroup at Moon Base ALUCE, is not seen for the rest of the movie.
Constructed with the help of the Sentinel races, the SDF-4, with a total length of over is the Robotech Expeditionary Force's largest and most advanced spaceship.
Secondary Continuity.
In the original Robotech TV series, a portion of the REF fleet is destroyed when the Invid fled earth in their pure energy form. Though a number of vessels - not, as some materials asserted, the entire fleet - are shown to have disintegrated by the final Invid move, whether the SDF-4 was also destroyed is never actually seen and had previously been open to speculation. The non-canon Jack McKinney novels #12 "Symphony of Light" and #18 "The End of the Circle" state that nearly the entire REF fleet, including Reinhardt and his vessel (identified as "flagship"), were destroyed during the Invid's departure; but not the "Ark Angel", the ship which Vince Grant commanded. Later in Jack McKinney novel #18, "The End of the Circle", a new SDF was being constructed and was named SDF-4.
The above explanation of events was accepted as accurate until the release of the 2006 film , which instead revealed that Reinhardt, the SDF-4, and most of the REF fleet survived the battle. The departure of the Regess in the "Shadow Chronicles" shows the Invid energy passing through the REF fleet but without damaging any ships, one of several instances in which the new continuity finds itself at odds with the old.

Raining Cats and Frogs

Raining Cats and Frogs (French: , literally "The Prophecy of Frogs") is an award winning French traditional animation children's feature film, released in 2003, directed by Jacques-Rémy Girerd and written by Girerd, Antoine Lanciaux and Iouri Tcherenkov at the animation studio Folimage. It is the first feature produced by Folimage and is distributed internationally by Universal Pictures.
The movie is loosely based on the story of Noah's Ark. It is about a group of frogs who predict an imminent disaster where it will rain for forty days and forty nights. They tell a boy and girl who subsequently help save the animals in a zoo.
The French DVD was released in 2005 with English subtitles.
The US and Canada DVD "Raining Cats and Frogs" was released in 2008.
Plot.
Ferdinand Bauer lives with his wife Juliette on a farm on a hill with their adoptive son (actually his grandson), Tom. The film begins when they agree to care of Lili, his other granddaughter, whom they will look after while Lili's parents travel by car and trailer to Africa on a safari. Lili's parents own a zoo, which they also leave in the care of Ferdinand and Juliette.
On the farm, there is a small pond. The frogs in the pond are restless, as their calculations have shown that the Earth is about to be flooded for forty days and forty nights. The frogs initially are reluctant to thell them, since they cannot change anything but decide to tell Tom and Lili, so that they can warn people.
Suddenly the flod starts, apparently washing away all live on Earth. The zoo animals escape to the barn which is on top of a hill, the foundations of the building are torn away by the flod and floats on a huge tractor tire on the water. Ferdinand, an experienced sailor, takes on the role of the captain and every one agrees that they will only survive if they stick together. When the rains finally stop all the animals are very hungry. Ferdinand has stored 28 tons of potatoes which he uses to make French fries, but the carnivores are unhappy because they cannot survive only on French fries but Ferdinand convinces the carnivores to yield in view of the greater good of everyone on the floating barn.
A tortoise appears, injured by a crocodile attack and has lost a leg. Lili befriends the tortoise and Tom notices that she has kept her distance from him ever since. The fox and the lion grudge about their lot of having to feed on potatoes when a voice tells them that they should raise against such decision but the lion prevails in that they should respect the captain's law, however after a few days their huger gets the best of them and they attack a sheep and Ferdinand vanishes the carnivores to a bathing tub that floats behind the barn. In the meantime, Ferdinand and Tom talk about his father, who was the machinist at Ferdinand's boat, who was very handy with them. Ferdinand manages to "motorize" the barn by modifying an old tractor engine to oars at the side of the building. 
The tortoise tells Lili her story of how she saved her life and three of her eggs despite losing her limb to the crocodiles, who attacked everyone, including humans, at the time of the flod and convinces Lili that her parents died. Ferdinand and Juliette adopt Lili as their own. At night the carnivores notice that the tortoise is actually in cahoots with the crocodiles to feed the entire barn to them, but she must get rid of the captain. The carnivores are initially unconvinced, but they latter agree to mutiny and in the ensuing fight they throw Ferdinand off the board in a barrell and Juliette jumps off after him. The rest of the animals and the children are locked away at the bottom of the barn. Lili sees now that she fell into the tortoise's trap, who had told her that she would not be her friend if she continued being friends with Tom.
The children and the animals hear a commotion upstairs, which is the result of the carnivores feeding on the poultry, so the children decide to climb on the giraffe's neck, but are overcome by the others. The tortoise convinces most of the carnivores to eat the children next, only the lion and one of the cats are reluctant to do it, but the majority decision is that they are next. The tortoise explains that she is taking revenge on humans because they have pursued and killed her family and her kind for their flesh, eggs and to make luxury items with their carapace, telling the children that the eggs that she keeps in her carapace are not her own but the crocodiles' who believe that the humans had eaten them and thus prompting the attacks on them. Meanwhile one of the cats convinces the other to help the children, since humans had taken them in when they had no home and if this senseless flesh-eating frenzy continues, there is no guarantee that the kittens inside her womb will be safe.
The tortoise signals the crocodiles to start the attack, the cat frees the children who manage to start the tractor engine and escape from the crocodiles, who are in pursuit of the barn. In the meantime Ferdinand finally manages to wake up and sees that the barn is coming at them at full speed. The tortoise finally manages to break the engine down and the barn seems finally at the mercy of the crocodiles, but the elephants manage to rip the carapace off the tortoise and everyone sees that it is not a female but a male, therefore the eggs cannot be his. As the tortoise is trying to explain his way out the situation, the eggs hatch and out of them come little crocodiles, proving the case against the tortoise. The tortoise is at the mercy of the angry animals who are about to throw him off to the crocodiles, but Ferdinand arrives at the last minute and berates everyone for their violent conduct. He resumes his command as captain, crocodiles leave after acknowledging that they were duped by the tortoise, who remains caparaceless in the barn.
A few days go by and the kittens are born. The general happiness is interrupted when the elephants, who have been unable to move during all their time in the barn, appear at the door to congratulate the proud mother. Ferdinand walks out of the barn and sees that the water has finally gone and that dryland is finally there. There is a lot of mist and as it lifts, all the people and animals at the barn see that there are more boats on the top of other mountains and that there are many survivors. Later that night all celebrate but a huge light interrupts the festivities, it is a large car driven by Lili's parents, who tell the rest that the flood did not take place in Africa.
Critical reception.
The film was honored at the 4th International Festival of Animated Feature Films where it was awarded the prize for Best Feature Picture.

The Story of Maths

The Story of Maths is a four-part British television series outlining aspects of the history of mathematics. It was a co-production between the Open University and the BBC and aired in October 2008 on BBC Four. The material was written and presented by University of Oxford professor Marcus du Sautoy. The consultants were the Open University academics Robin Wilson, professor Jeremy Gray and June Barrow-Green. Kim Duke is credited as series producer.
The series comprised four programmes respectively titled: "The Language of the Universe"; "The Genius of the East"; "The Frontiers of Space"; and" To Infinity and Beyond". Du Sautoy documents the development of mathematics covering subjects such as the invention of zero and the unproven Riemann hypothesis, a 150 year old problem for whose solution the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a $1,000,000 prize. He escorts viewers through the subject's history and geography. He examines the development of key mathematical ideas and shows how mathematical ideas underpin the world's science, technology, and culture.
He starts his journey in ancient Egypt and finishes it by looking at current mathematics. Between he travels through Babylon, Greece, India, China, and the medieval Middle East. He also looks at mathematics in Europe and then in America and takes the viewers inside the lives of many of the greatest mathematicians.
"The Language of the Universe".
In this opening programme Marcus du Sautoy looks at how important and fundamental mathematics is to our lives before looking at the mathematics of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece.
Du Sautoy commences in Egypt where recording the patterns of the seasons and in particular the flooding of the Nile was essential to their economy. There was a need to solve practical problems such as land area for taxation purposes. Du Sautoy discovers the use of a decimal system based on the fingers on the hands, the unusual method for multiplication and division. He examines the Rhind Papyrus, the Moscow Papyrus and explores their understanding of binary numbers, fractions and solid shapes.
He then travels to Babylon and discovered that the way we tell the time today is based on the Babylonian 60 base number system. So because of the Babylonians we have 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour. He then shows how the Babylonians used quadratic equations to measure their land. He deals briefly with Plimpton 322.
In Greece, the home of ancient Greek mathematics, he looks at the contributions of some of its greatest and well known mathematicians including Pythagoras, Plato, Euclid, and Archimedes, who are some of the people who are credited with beginning the transformation of mathematics from a tool for counting into the analytical subject we know today. A controversial figure, Pythagoras’ teachings were considered suspect and his followers seen as social outcasts and a little be strange and not in the norm. There is a legend going around that one of his followers, Hippasus, was drowned when he announced his discovery of irrational numbers. As well as his work on the properties of right angled triangles, Pythagoras developed another important theory after observing musical instruments. He discovered that the intervals between harmonious musical notes are always in whole number intervals. It deals briefly with Hypatia of Alexandria.
"The Genius of the East".
With the decline of ancient Greece, the development of maths stagnated in Europe. However the progress of mathematics continued in the East. Du Sautoy describes both the Chinese use of maths in engineering projects and their belief in the mystical powers of numbers. He mentions Qin Jiushao.
He describes Indian mathematicians’ invention of trigonometry; their introduction of a symbol for the number zero and their contribution to the new concepts of infinity and negative numbers. It shows Gwalior Fort where zero is inscribed on its walls. It mentions the work of Brahmagupta and Bhāskara II on the subject of zero. He mentions Madhava of Sangamagrama and Aryabhata.
Du Sautoy then considers the Middle East: the invention of the new language of algebra and the evolution of a solution to cubic equations. He talks about the House of Wisdom with Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī and he visits University of Al-Karaouine. He mentions Omar Khayyám.
Finally he examines the spread of Eastern knowledge to the West through mathematicians such as Leonardo Fibonacci, famous for the Fibonacci sequence. He mentions Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia.
"The Frontiers of Space".
From the seventeenth century, Europe replaced the Middle East as the engine house of mathematical ideas. Du Sautoy visits Urbino to introduce Perspective using mathematician and artist, Piero della Francesca's "The Flagellation of Christ".
Du Sautoy proceeds to describes René Descartes realisation that it was possible to describe curved lines as equations and thus link algebra and geometry. He talks with Henk Bos about Descartes. He shows how one of Pierre de Fermat’s theorems is now the basis for the codes that protect credit card transactions on the internet. He describes Isaac Newton’s development of math and physics crucial to understanding the behaviour of moving objects in engineering. He covers the Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy and the Bernoulli family. He further covers Leonhard Euler, the father of topology, and Gauss' invention of a new way of handling equations, modular arithmetic. He mentions János Bolyai.
The further contribution of Gauss to our understanding of how prime numbers are distributed is covered thus providing the platform for Bernhard Riemann's theories on prime numbers. In addition Riemann worked on the properties of objects, which he saw as manifolds that could exist in multi-dimensional space.
"To Infinity and Beyond".
Hilbert's first problem.
The final episode considers the great unsolved problems that confronted mathematicians in the 20th century. On 8 August 1900 David Hilbert gave a historic talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. Hilbert posed twenty-three then unsolved problems in mathematics which he believed were of the most immediate importance. Hilbert succeeded in setting the agenda for 20thC mathematics and the programme commenced with Hilbert's first problem.
Georg Cantor considered the infinite set of whole numbers 1, 2, 3 ... ∞ which he compared with the smaller set of numbers 10, 20, 30 ... ∞. Cantor showed that these two infinite sets of numbers actually had the same size as it was possible to pair each number up; 1 - 10, 2 - 20, 3 - 30 ... etc.
If fractions now are considered there are an infinite number of fractions between any of the two whole numbers, suggesting that the infinity of fractions is bigger than the infinity of whole numbers. Yet Cantor was still able to pair each such fraction to a whole number 1 - 1/1; 2 - 2/1; 3 - 1/2 ... etc. through to ∞; i.e. the infinities of both fractions and whole numbers were shown to have the same size.
But when the set of all infinite decimal numbers was considered, Cantor was able to prove that this produced a bigger infinity. This was because, no matter how one tried to construct such a list, Cantor was able to provide a new decimal number that was missing from that list. Thus he showed that there were different infinities, some bigger than others.
However there was a problem that Cantor was unable to solve: Is there an infinity sitting between the smaller infinity of all the fractions and the larger infinity of the decimals? Cantor believed, in what became known as the Continuum Hypothesis, that there is no such set. This would be the first problem listed by Hilbert.
Poincaré conjecture.
Next Marcus discusses Henri Poincaré's work on the discipline of 'Bendy geometry'. If two shapes can be moulded or morphed to each other's shape then they have the same topology. Poincaré was able to identify all possible two-dimensional topological surfaces; however in 1904 he came up with a topological problem, the Poincaré conjecture, that he could not solve; namely what are all the possible shapes for a 3D universe.
According to the programme, the question was solved in 2002 by Grigori Perelman who linked the problem to a different area of mathematics. Perelman looked at the dynamics of the way things can flow over the shape. This enabled him to find all the ways that 3D space could be wrapped up in higher dimensions.
David Hilbert.
The achievements of David Hilbert were now considered. In addition to Hilbert's problems, Hilbert space, Hilbert Classification and the Hilbert Inequality, du Sautoy highlights Hilbert's early work on equations as marking him out as a mathematician able to think in new ways. Hilbert showed that, while there were an infinity of equations, these equations could be constructed from a finite number of building block like sets. Ironically Hilbert could not construct that list of sets; he simply proved that it existed. In effect Hilbert had created a new more abstract style of Mathematics.
Hilbert's second problem.
For 30 years Hilbert believed that mathematics was a universal language powerful enough to unlock all the truths and solve each of his 23 Problems. Yet, even as Hilbert was stating "We must know, we will know", Kurt Gödel had shattered this belief; he had formulated the Incompleteness Theorem based on his study of Hilbert's second problem:
Using a code based on prime numbers, Gödel was able to transform the above into a pure statement of arithmetic. Logically, the above cannot be false and hence Gödel had discovered the existence of mathematical statements that were true but were incapable of being proved.
Hilbert's first problem revisited.
In 1950s American mathematician Paul Cohen took up the challenge of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis which asks "is there is or isn't there an infinite set of number bigger than the set of whole numbers but smaller than the set of all decimals". Cohen found that there existed two equally consistent mathematical worlds. In one world the Hypothesis was true and there did not exist such a set. Yet there existed a mutually exclusive but equally consistent mathematical proof that Hypothesis was false and there was such a set. Cohen would subsequently work on Hilbert's eighth problem, the Riemann hypothesis, although without the success of his earlier work.
Hilbert's tenth problem.
Hilbert's tenth problem asked if there was some universal method that could tell whether any equation had whole number solutions or not. The growing belief was that no so such method was possible yet the question remained, how could you prove that, no matter how ingenious you were, you would never come up with such a method. He mentions Paul Cohen. To answer this Julia Robinson, who created the Robinson Hypothesis which stated that to show that there was no such method all you had to do was cook up one equation whose solutions were a very specific set of numbers: The set of numbers needed to grow exponentially yet still be captured by the equations at the heart of Hilbert's problem. Robinson was unable to find this set. This part of the solution fell to Yuri Matiyasevich who saw how to capture the Fibonacci sequence using the equations at the heart of Hilbert's tenth.
Algebraic geometry.
The final section briefly covers algebraic geometry. Évariste Galois had refined a new language for mathematics. Galois believed mathematics should be the study of structure as opposed to number and shape. Galois had discovered new techniques to tell whether certain equations could have solutions or not. The symmetry of certain geometric objects was the key. Galois' work was picked up by André Weil who built Algebraic Geometry, a whole new language. Weil's work connected number theory, algebra, topology and geometry.
Finally du Sautoy mentions Weil's part in the creation of the fictional mathematician Nicolas Bourbaki and another contributor to Bourbaki's output - Alexander Grothendieck.

Ed Albrecht

Edward Arthur Albrecht (February 28, 1929 – December 29, 1979) was a professional baseball pitcher. He played parts of two seasons in Major League Baseball, 1949 and 1950, for the St. Louis Browns.
In 1949, at the age of 20, Albrecht earned his shot at the majors by having a record-breaking season in what was then the Class C Cotton States League. Pitching for the Pine Bluff Judges, Albrecht won 29 games and struck out 389 batters, both all-time records for the league. The Browns called him up to make a start for them on the last day of the season, in which he earned his one and only major league win. Albrecht pitched in two games for the Browns in 1950 before returning to the minors, retiring in 1953.
In an odd statistical coincidence, Albrecht's ERA in both of his major league seasons was exactly the same as his career ERA of 5.40.

Henry Gunther

Henry Nicholas John Gunther (June 6, 1895 – November 11, 1918) was an American soldier and the last soldier killed during World War I. He was killed one minute before the armistice at 11 am.
Early life.
Henry Gunther was born into a German-American family in Baltimore, Maryland, on June 6, 1895. His parents, George Gunther and Lina Roth, were both children of German immigrants. He grew up in Highlandtown, an East Baltimore neighborhood heavily influenced by German immigrants, where his family belonged to Sacred Heart of Jesus Roman Catholic parish. Henry Gunther worked as a bookkeeper at the National Bank of Baltimore. He joined the Knights of Columbus in 1915.
War service.
Gunther was drafted in September 1917 and was appointed to the 313th Regiment, which had the nickname "Baltimore's Own" and was part of the 157th Brigade of the 79th Infantry Division. As a supply sergeant, he was responsible for clothing in his military unit, and arrived in France in July 1918 as part of the American Expeditionary Forces. A critical letter home, in which he reported on the "miserable conditions" at the front and advised a friend to try anything to avoid being drafted, was intercepted by the censor. As a result, he was demoted from sergeant to private.
Gunther's unit, Company A, arrived at the front on September 12, 1918. Like all Allied units on the front of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, it was still embroiled in fighting on the morning of November 11. The Armistice with Germany was signed by 5:00 am, but it would only come into force at 11:00 am. Gunther's squad approached a roadblock of two German machine guns in the village of Chaumont-devant-Damvillers. Gunther got up, against the orders of his sergeant and close friend, Ernest Powell, and charged with his bayonet. The German soldiers, aware of the armistice that would take effect in one minute, tried to wave Gunther off. He kept going and fired "a shot or two". When he got too close to the machine guns, he was shot and killed instantly. The writer James M. Cain, then a reporter for the "Baltimore Sun", interviewed Gunther's comrades afterward and wrote that "Gunther brooded a great deal over his reduction in rank, and became obsessed with a determination to make good before his officers and fellow soldiers."
General John J. Pershing's order of the day on the following day mentioned Gunther as the last American killed in the war. The Army posthumously restored his rank of sergeant and awarded him a Divisional Citation for Gallantry in Action and the Distinguished Service Cross. A Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Baltimore was named after him.
Gunther's remains were returned to the United States in 1923 and buried at Most Holy Redeemer Cemetery in Baltimore. Subsequent investigations revealed that on the last day of World War I, between the signing of the armistice and its entry into force, about 11,000 men were wounded or killed - far more than usual.
Memorials.
On November 11, 2008, a memorial was constructed near the place where Gunther died. On November 11, 2010, a memorial plaque was unveiled at his grave site.
Book and film.
Roger Faindt wrote a book about Gunther, "10h59 ; Henry Gunther, le dernier soldat americain mort en 1918" (ISBN 2953512306, 2009). It is being adapted into an English language film titled "10h59", scheduled to begin shooting in 2013 with a budget of 12 million euros.

The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Precursor Tank Class was a class of 4-4-2 tank steam locomotives. Fifty were built to the design of George Whale between 1906 and 1909, being a tank engine version of his Precursor Class.
The first thirty had carrying wheels, the latter twenty had carrying wheels. The LNWR reused numbers from withdrawn locomotives, so the numbering system was completely haphazard. The 3 ft 9 in engines were numbered by 528, 531, 784, 1295, 1305, 1981–1985, 97, 111, 181, 196, 562, 616, 803, 1356, 1508, 2210, 139, 653, 834, 874, 1506, 1572, 1589, 1671, 1714, and 2165. The 3 ft 3 in engines were numbered 44, 527, 612, 762, 827, 875, 1427, 1764, 2196, 2446, 920, 935, 1164, 1219, 1523, 1536, 1551, 2077, 2223 and 2228.
All fifty passed into LMS ownership in 1923. The LMS gave them the power classification 2P. The LMS also renumbered them into solid block of numbers: 6780–6809 for the 3 ft 9 in engines and 6810–6829 for the 3 ft 3 in engines, in the order given above.
They were withdrawn between 1927 and 1940. None were preserved.

Sidestrand Halt railway station

Sidestrand Halt was a railway station on the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway which briefly served the Norfolk coastal village of Sidestrand from 1936 to 1953.
History.
Much like its counterpart at Cromer Links Halt, Sidestrand consisted of a simple wooden platform capable of accommodating one coach. Hidden away at the end of a public footpath, the station did not have any ticket-issuing facilities, and these could only be purchased on the trains. The halt had been opened in an attempt to increase revenues on the line by further exploiting the tourist potential of "Poppyland", but in the event it only lasted seventeen years and closed along with the section of the line between Cromer and Mundesley in 1953.

John Brayford

John Robert Brayford (born 29 December 1987) is an English footballer who plays as a defender for Sheffield United on loan from Cardiff City. Born in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, he began his career at non-league Burton Albion before moves to Crewe Alexandra and Derby County preceded his time at Cardiff, and has also made seven appearances for the England C team.
Career.
Crewe Alexandra.
Brayford started his career at non-league Burton Albion, where he made almost 80 league appearance, before signing for League One side Crewe Alexandra on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee on 1 September 2008. Burton later revealed that the fee was an initial up-front payment of £80,000, which would be raised to £130,000 if he were to progress into the first team. He made his debut for the club in a 3–0 defeat to Scunthorpe United on 11 October. Although Brayford's first season with Crewe ended in relegation for the club, it was a successful season on a personal level, as he won the Fans' Player of the Season, and attracted the interest of several bigger clubs.
In the summer of 2009, Crewe confirmed Brayford's former manager Nigel Clough was interested in taking Brayford to Derby County, and that they were prepared to sell him to a club that matched Crewe's valuation of the player. No deal materialised however and Brayford remained with Crewe for the full 2009–10 season, missing just one game and being named captain. Starting the season at right back, he finished it at centre half and earned a place in the PFA Football League Two Team of the Season as well as retaining the club's Player of the Season award.
With this form, Derby's long standing interest seemed to have reached its conclusion with reports that the Crewe had agreed a deal for £400,000 plus add-ons, though this was denied by Crewe boss Dario Gradi. Brayford was again linked with Derby as part of a joint £1m move to the Rams with team-mate James Bailey, with Crewe confirming that an offer for the pair, of around £1m, rising to £1.3m with add-ons and a percentage sell on clause, had been accepted.
Derby County.
Brayford formally completed his move to Derby County on 19 May 2010 for an undisclosed fee, signing a three-year deal. With the sale of Paul Connolly to Leeds United, Brayford found himself as the only naturally right sided defender at the club and was placed straight into the first team during the club's 2010–11 pre season fixtures. Brayford kept his place when the 2010–11 Championship season began, and played every minute of all Derby's 48 league and cup matches during the season. Although primarily employed as a right back, consistent injuries to other members of the Derby defence saw Brayford employed at centre-back and left-back through the course of the campaign. Earning plaudits for his ability to combine an attacking role with his defensive duties, Brayford scored once (in a 4–1 home victory over Watford) and assisted three times, and was considered one of the star performers as Derby initially challenged for promotion (being 4th in the table in November 2010) before a run of 4 wins in 24 games saw them plummet down to 19th in the table by the end of April. He was named the Derby County Supporters' Club Player of the Year at a Gala Dinner on 19 April 2011, before picking up The Jack Stamps Trophy before the final home game of the season against Bristol City on 30 April, having won the voting by a "considerable margin."
In August 2011, Brayford signed a new contract extending his stay at the club until the summer of 2014. He appeared in Derby's first ten games of the season, as Derby had their best start to a season for over 106 years, picking up 19 points from the first 10 games to sit third in the table. However, an injury in training, prior to the match against league leaders Southampton, ended a run of 59 consecutive appearances and caused him to miss his first minutes of Derby action since joining 15 months previously. In his absence, Derby recorded just five points from six games to fall out of the play off places. Brayford returned in a 2–0 defeat against Hull City on 19 November 2011, however he picked up a thigh injury in the following game. keeping him out of action for a further three weeks. Having returned to the side, a recurrence of his thigh injury in February ruled brayford out for a further six weeks. Brayford returned to the first team squad in April 2012, but was unable to reclaim a regular spot in Derby's starting eleven.
Brayford started the 2012–13 season as the regular starter at right back once more and scored his first goal in over two years in a 4–1 win at home to Blackpool. In November, Brayford was linked with a move to Premier League side West Ham United amid rumours that Derby needed to raise funds in the summer, although Rams manager Nigel Clough denied the rumours. During the January transfer window, Brayford was linked with a move to Championship leaders Cardiff City, however after the transfer window closed Brayford dismissed these rumours and stated his intention to stay at Derby. Brayford's ever present role in Derby's starting eleven during the season was apparently ended in early March when he sustained a torn hamstring. Brayford did return for the final five games of the season, but having only a year left on his contract, manager Nigel Clough expected Brayford to move to a Premier League club during the summer of 2013. The first confirmed interest in Brayford came at the end of June 2013, when a £1m bid from Wigan Athletic was rejected by Derby. However a month later, a £1.5 million bid from Premier League newcomers Cardiff City was accepted.
Cardiff City.
On 26 July 2013 John Brayford signed a four-year contract for Cardiff City, becoming City's second signing of the summer. Brayford was unable to make the break into Cardiff's first team however, playing only two League Cup matches during the first half of the 2013–14 season. His failure to even make the substitutes bench in any other match led to speculation that he would be allowed to return to former club Derby County by manager Malky Mackay. Following Mackay's dismissal, Brayford continued to be overlooked by his replacements and did not even make the Cardiff bench for their league games.
On 24 January 2014 Brayford joined Sheffield United on loan until the end of the season to be reunited with Nigel Clough for the third time in his career. making his debut two days later in a 1–1 FA Cup draw with Fulham.

George Edwin Ellison

George Edwin Ellison (1878 – 11 November 1918) was the last British soldier to be killed in the First World War.
Biography.
Ellison came from Leeds, England. Early in his life, he joined the army as a regular soldier, but had left by 1912 when he got married to Hannah Maria Burgan and had become a coal miner. Sometime just before the outbreak of war he was recalled to the army, joining the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, serving in the army at the start of the war. He fought at the Battle of Mons in 1914, and several other battles including the Battle of Ypres, Battle of Armentières, Battle of La Bassée, Battle of Lens, Battle of Loos, and Battle of Cambrai on the Western Front. He was killed an hour and a half before the armistice, on a patrol on the outskirts of Mons, Belgium.
Ellison is buried in the St Symphorien military cemetery, just southeast of Mons. Coincidentally, and in large part due to Mons being lost in the very opening stages of the war and regained at the very end (from the British perspective), his grave faces that of John Parr, the first British soldier killed during the Great War.
He was survived by Hannah and a son, James Cornelius, just 5 days short of his fifth birthday when his father was killed. At least two grandchildren of his were alive as of 2008.

<doc id="20030164" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20030164" title="Hart-Cluett Mansion">
Hart-Cluett Mansion

The Hart-Cluett Mansion is located at 57 Second Street in Troy, New York, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and is a contributing property to the Central Troy Historic District created in 1986. Since the 1950s it, and the Carr Building next door, has been the main office of the Rensselaer County Historical Society, The house is open to the public as a historic house museum.
Built in 1827 from a plan by most likely by architect Martin Euclid Thompson, of New York City, it is a Federal style townhouse with decorated marble and limestone facing considered one of the best and most intact houses in that style in the city of Troy. The house was built by John Bard Colgrove, who moved to Troy, NY in 1826 to oversee the construction of the Hart House. Immediately after constructing the Hart House, Colgrove built the first Rensselaer County Court House (1828–31). It was constructed as a gift for his only child, Betsey Howard Hart, and her husband, Richard P. Hart, by wealthy New York City merchant and banker William Howard, done in a style similar to contemporary mansions there. Those homes have since been demolished, making Troy the only extant place visitors can experience an early 19th-century New York City mansion.
In the late 19th century it became the property of another local businessman, George Cluett, who expanded it in the early 20th century. He and his family donated the house to the Historical Society in 1952.
Building.
The house is L-shaped, two and a half stories high with a full basement. The short end facing the street to its east and the long end wrapping around the brick house to its north. The front facade is four bays wide; the southern facade, accounting for the house's full depth from the street and overlooking a narrow alley, nine. All other facades save the front are done in brick.
That front facade is dominated by its off-center entrance. The recessed door is set in a portico, with elliptical fanlight supported by small columns and sidelights. Around the portico are a marble architrave with vermiculated keystone and quoins. No similar marble houses, are found in Troy, or the vicinity. The marble is presumed to come from a Berkshire quarry, possibly near Great Barrington, Mass. The marble has vertical comb finish, approximately 6 to the inch and is laid with 1/8" lime mortar joints.
The tin gabled roof has two dormer windows on the east side. Two chimneys apiece rise from the north and south ends. There is one outbuilding, a former carriage house, in the rear of the building.
Inside, the house follows the standard Federal-style central hall plan, with high ceilings and narrow, tall windows. Much of the original furnishings and trim remain. The plaster and woodwork are unaltered, as are such details as a marble mantelpiece and dining room mirror. The original basement kitchen remains, along with a late 19th-century one on the first floor.
History.
Hart, an early member of Troy's business elite, was a personal friend of Howard when he married Betsey. He had made his money first by supplying the Army during the War of 1812 and then in commerce from the Erie and Champlain canals. He later served as president of the Schenectady and Troy Railroad and several local philanthropies. He had a political career as well, serving as a state assemblyman and mayor of Troy.
To build the house, 29-year-old John Colegrove was hired. He moved to Troy from New York in 1826 to supervise the job, and stayed there, going on to build many other notable buildings in the city. His obituary in 1860 referred to the mansion as his first major local accomplishment.
The original house was just the square block. The house was first enlarged in 1836 when Richard Hart was Mayor of Troy. Richard Hart died in 1843. Betsey remained in the house till her death in 1886 and her daughter Sarah Wool Hart was the last Hart to live in the house. She died in 1892 and the house was then sold to George B. Cluett, founder of Cluett, Peabody & Co. Inc. makers of Arrow Shirts. George and his wife Amanda had a new addition built that moved the kitchen to the first floor, replacing the original basement kitchen. He sold the house to his nephew Albert E. Cluett, in 1910. 
Albert and Caroline Cluett made alterations on the third floor, raising the roof to accommodate the growing needs of their four sons. New oak floors, picture and chair rail mouldings all in the Colonial Revival Style were added to the two parlors and entrance hall. The old wallpaper was removed and the walls were painted ivory. A scenic wallpaper from the Zuber & Co. of Paris, France was installed on the walls of the Entrance Hall on the first floor.
Albert Cluett died in 1949 but not before he and his wife Caroline challenged the Board of Trustees at RCHS to raise money to support the preservation of the house. Caroline lived in the house until 1952 when she then signed the house over to RCHS. The society has maintained it as a historic house museum and uses the adjoining Joseph B. Carr Building (57 2nd Street) as their museum headquarters that house the changing exhibition galleries, research library, collection storage and adminsitrative offices.

Michelle Corrigan

Michelle Corrigan is a fictional character in the BBC soap opera "Doctors", played by Donnaleigh Bailey. She made her first appearance on 8 June 2006 and departed on 13 August 2010 to join the Army.
Storylines.
Michelle permanently fell out with Ruth after she caught her in bed with her half brother Adam. Before this their colleague Daniel Granger witnessed Ruth pretending and declaring to be Michelle and this had led to a patient nearly dying of a heart attack. When Daniel warned Michelle of Ruth's strange antics, Michelle confronted Adam about his relationship with Ruth. She discovered he had been seeing her secretly and that Ruth had been stealing her possessions including her clothes for months. Initially, Michelle thought Adam was defending Ruth and that he knew that she was her friend, but he insisted that he had no idea of what Ruth was actually doing, that he loved her more than Michelle which was why he offered that Ruth should be referred to a mental health institute, where she was later sectioned. Due to this, Ruth stole and took away Michelle's pendant that Michelle's dad had given her when she was a child. Michelle was furious to learn that Julia Parsons was letting Ruth stay at her place after her release from section. She decided that she should leave but Heston Carter and Cherry managed to persuade her to stay. Heston told her that Ruth wouldn't be allowed back to the surgery. However, Melody determined that Ruth was ready to return to work which, as predicted, made Michelle furious.
She is good friends with her colleague Cherry Malone. She used to be friends with colleague Ruth Pearce, but at the start of Series 11 they fell out. Michelle has recently been drinking vodka from the bottle in work. Cherry came across this by accident when she came back into the campus after work, she decided not to tell anyone except Simon what she had seen. Because Michelle was drinking she made a mistake and gave Cherry the wrong needle in the vaccination clinic, making a man go in to anaphylaxic shock. She told Cherry that she would tell Julia the truth, that it was her mistake. But in the meeting she lied and said that she took full responsibility because she should have double-checked but that it was Cherry's mistake. Cherry told Julia about Michelle's drinking and that it was Michelle's fault in the clinic but when Michelle's bag was searched, she had hidden the vodka and Cherry was suspended. Fortunately Michelle told the truth to Julia and all was revealed. Cherry and Michelle stay friends but are not as close as they were.

Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 1st Count of Melito

Diego Hurtado de Mendoza (in full, ) (1468–1536) was a Castilian general and administrator. He served in the Italian Wars, and was later appointed Viceroy of Valencia where he fought the rebel "Germanies" in the Revolt of the Brotherhoods.
Early life.
Diego was the second son of Cardinal Pedro González de Mendoza and Mencia de Lemos, making him a member of the powerful Mendoza family. As Cardinal Mendoza was already a Cardinal, Diego was born out of wedlock. He was born and raised in the castle of Manzanares el Real.
Italian wars.
He joined the army and fought in the Granada War. After it completed in 1492, Mendoza advanced in rank and served in the Second Italian war, where he distinguished himself serving under Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, ""el Gran Capitán"." He played an important role in the Battle of Ruvo and in the taking of Melito in the Kingdom of Naples, for which he was appointed Count of Mélito in 1506. 
As viceroy of Valencia.
In 1520, he was appointed Viceroy of Valencia. Valencia was at the time unsettled by plague and flood, and the "germanies" (guilds) were taking control of the city of Valencia from the weak royal government there. Mendoza, a Castilian, was not well-received, and he provoked the "Germanies" by siding with the nobility and refusing to seat lawfully-elected representatives from the populace that favored the "Germanies". The viceroy's palace was attacked, and only barely held out after two hours assault. Mendoza and the government fled into the countryside, and the open warfare phase of the Revolt of the Brotherhoods began. Mendoza was initially defeated by the agermanats at the Battle of Gandia in June 1521, but royalist troops triumphed elsewhere, and he eventually returned with reinforcements into the city of Valencia in November 1521. He acted with moderation against the defeated rebels, but the arrival in 1523 of the new Viceroy Germaine of Foix, widow of Ferdinand of Aragon, saw the punishment of the rebels intensify.
Diego was married to Ana de la Cerda y Castro, granddaughter of Gastón de la Cerda, 4th Count of Medinaceli. He died in Toledo in 1536.

Mickey DeLorenzo

Mickey DeLorenzo, also known as hey_suburbia, became known worldwide as the "Wii Workout Guy" in January 2007. DeLorenzo, a 27 year old Nintendo fan and blogger from Philadelphia, PA, turned his passion for the Wii console into an experiment, just days after its November 2006 release. For six weeks, DeLorenzo played the video game "Wii Sports" every day and made no other alteration to his diet or exercise habits. Ultimately he lost 9 lb. He played a significant role in the renewal of the "exergaming" craze that swept through gamers' living rooms, gyms, nursing homes, and schools during 2007. He was featured in newspapers, on TV, and websites all over the world.
DeLorenzo is also the owner and editor-in-chief at NintendoFuse, a gaming website, containing reviews, news, and coverage of Nintendo games and consoles.

Wii Sports Experiment.
At his personal Nintendo fan site, DeLorenzo posted graphs and funny video clips documenting his experiment. In one, he runs through the streets of Philadelphia with his Wii controllers in hand and jumps up and down on the top steps to the city's art museum as the "Rocky" theme plays. In another, he and his wife box, bowl, play tennis and swing the baseball bat in front of a TV.
He has partnered with Traineo.com, a Web site that helps people track their weight-loss and fitness goals, to create the Wii Workout.
DeLorenzo had planned to write a book based on his Wii Sports videos. He had a ghost writer from Men's Health Magazine, a literary agent, and a publisher. Ultimately Nintendo did not approve of the book, and the plans have been canceled.
Relationship with Nintendo.
DeLorenzo has no direct relationship with Nintendo, but has been acknowledged by the Japanese company. Nintendo flew DeLorenzo to New York City to be one of the first to test out Nintendo's new product "Wii Fit".

Porto Alegre Botanical Garden

The Porto Alegre Botanical Garden is a Foundation of Rio Grande do Sul located on the street Salvador França, in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
History.
The project for a botanical garden in Porto Alegre dates back to the beginning of the 19th century, when Dom Joao VI, after creating the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, sent seedlings to Porto Alegre to establish another similar park in the city. Unfortunately these seedlings did not come to the capital, remaining trapped in Rio Grande, where they were planted. The agriculturist Paul Schoenwald subsequently donated a plot of land to the state government to establish a green area, but the project was unsuccessful.
A third attempt would be made in 1882, when councilman Francisco Pinto de Souza presented a proposal for scientific exploitation of the area then known as the "Várzea de Petrópolis", providing a garden and a promenade. Considered utopian, the plan was terminated and lay dormant for decades, only returning to consideration in the mid-20th century.
In 1953 the 2136 law authorized the selling of an area of "81.57 hectares", of which "50 hectares" would be to create a park or botanical garden. A committee, which included prominent teacher and religious figure "Teodoro Luís", was formed to develop the project, which began in 1957 with the first planting of selected species: a collection of palm trees, conifers and succulent. When opened to the public on September 10, 1958, it already featured nearly 600 species.
Soon after, in 1962, was inaugurated the oven for cacti, in the 1970s and the botanical garden was integrated into Fundação Zoobotânica Foundation, along with the Park Zoo and the Museum of Natural Sciences. This season began the collection of trees, with emphasis on families of ecological importance (Myrtaceae, Rutaceae, Myrsinaceae, Bignoniaceae, Fabales, Zingiberales, among others), thematic groups (condiments and scented) and forest formations typical of the state, and is launched a program for expeditions to collect specimens and seeds.
A project linked to the Program "Pro-Guaíba" allowed in the 1990s an improvement in the infrastructure of the Botanical Garden, where nurseries were built for bromeliads, orchids, succulent, vines and cacti, and reforms have taken place in the center of visitors and the administration, beyond the creation of a seed bank.
Paleontology.
At the Museum of Natural Sciences, which is located inside the Porto Alegre Botanical Garden, there is an exhibition of fossils found in geopark of paleorrota, as well as contributing to publications on the subject.

Chargesheet

A Chargesheet is a formal document of accusation prepared by law-enforcement agencies in India and Bangladesh. It is distinct from the First Information Report (FIR) (which is the core document that describes a crime that has been committed), usually refers to one or more FIRs, and charges an individual or organization for (some or all of) the crimes specified in those FIR(s). 
Once the chargesheet has been submitted to a court of law, the court decides as to who among the accused has sufficient prima facie evidence against him to be put on trial. After the court pronounces its order on framing of charges, prosecution proceedings against the accused begin in the judicial system.

Chip Saltsman

John "Chip" Saltsman, Jr. (born March 24, 1968) is an American politician who has served as chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party from 1999 to 2001, senior political advisor to former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, and manager of Mike Huckabee's 2008 presidential campaign. He also works for the Chuck Fleischmann campaign in Tennessee's 3rd district from 2009 to 2010.
Early life.
Saltsman was born in Nashville, Tennessee to parents John B. Saltsman, Sr. and Edna Elaine Saltsman. He attended Father Ryan High School, a Catholic high school in Nashville, and then Christian Brothers University in Memphis, where he earned his bachelor's and master's in business administration degrees. While at Christian Brothers, Saltsman was active in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, the Knights of Columbus and student government.
Political career.
Interested in politics from an early age, Saltsman's first substantial campaign involvement was with President George H.W. Bush's re-election effort in 1992.
In 1994, as the Republican Revolution swept Senators Bill Frist and Fred Thompson into office, Saltsman was active in then-West Tennessee Congressman Don Sundquist's successful run for governor. Saltsman continued to work his way up through the Tennessee party ranks, becoming Tennessee Republican Party chairman in 1998.
Despite his service with Governor Sundquist, however, Saltsman strongly opposed Sundquist's plan to impose a state income tax for the first time in Tennessee history. The income tax plan eventually failed to become law due to strong grassroots opposition from conservatives across the state. Tennessee remains one of only nine states without a broad-based income tax.
Under Saltsman's watch as state party chairman in 2000, then-Governor George W. Bush defeated then-Vice President Al Gore in his home state of Tennessee, despite President Clinton's success there in 1992 and 1996 and despite the fact that Gore and his father had represented the state in the Senate for a combined 26 years. With a victory in Tennessee, Gore would have become President, rendering Bush's eventual Florida victory irrelevant.
Work with Frist.
Saltsman followed this accomplishment by working as Development Director for Senator Frist at the National Republican Senatorial Committee in the 2002, where he helped Republicans regain control of the Senate after the defection of Senator James Jeffords handed the chamber to Democratic control in May 2001.
Saltsman then became Senior Political Advisor to Majority Leader Frist at VOLPAC, a political action committee chaired by Frist and dedicated to recruitment and support of Republican candidates for political office nationwide. In 2004, eighteen of the twenty-two races that VOLPAC supported were successful. And, in 2006, VOLPAC helped ensure the election of Senator Bob Corker over Harold Ford, Jr. in Tennessee.
Saltsman was also an important figure in Senator Frist's preparations for a potential run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and was labeled "Frist's secret weapon" by Chris Cillizza of the "Washington Post" and "a multi-talented superstar ... has demonstrated uncanny, remarkable leadership in every endeavor he's undertaken" by Frist himself. However, following the completion of his two terms in the Senate, Frist decided against a run for the presidency.
Huckabee presidential campaign.
With Frist's departure from public service, Saltsman became National Campaign Manager for Governor Mike Huckabee's presidential campaign on February 1, 2007. Saltsman oversaw all aspects of the campaign, including political, fundraising, communications and operations, and he led the dark horse candidacy to a surprise second place in the Ames, Iowa Straw Poll on August 11, 2008 and then to victory in the Iowa Republican Caucuses on January 3, 2008. Huckabee's campaign proceeded to record victories in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, and West Virginia on February 5, 2008 or Super Tuesday. Huckabee then won the Kansas Republican Caucuses and the Louisiana Republican Primary before ending his campaign on March 4, 2008 with 270 pledged delegates.
Saltsman was nominated by Marc Ambinder of "The Atlantic" as one of the top four campaign managers of the election cycle, and has since been labeled a "noted GOP strategist" with "a strong future on the national campaign-management stage." He is a frequent Fox News contributor.
RNC Chair candidacy.
Saltsman announced his candidacy for RNC Chairman, after frequent mentions prior to announcing.
Saltsman was the first candidate to release a specific plan regarding the future of the party, which can be viewed at Our Plan for Republican Victory.
In his bid for the RNC Chairmanship, Saltsman has been endorsed by: former Republican presidential candidate Governor Mike Huckabee, former United States Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, Tennessee Lt. Governor Ron Ramsey, and Tennessee House Majority Leader Jason Mumpower.
Saltsman dropped out one day before the voting following a controversy regarding Saltsman's distribution of a CD containing the song 'Barack the Magic Negro".
Fleischmann Congressional campaign.
After incumbent U.S. Representative Zach Wamp decided to leave Congress to run for Governor of Tennessee, Saltsman became campaign manager for Chuck Fleischmann, an attorney and former talk radio host who sought the Republican nomination to succeed Wamp in the Third Congressional District seat. Mike Huckabee endorsed Fleischmann on March, 2010. Fleischmann's biggest competition in the Republican primary was expected to come from former state GOP chairwoman Robin Smith. The U.S. House Republican whip Eric Cantor, chief deputy whip Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican Conference chairman Mike Pence and Newt Gingrich had endorsed Smith. Fleischmann won the August 5, 2010 primary, topping a field of 11 candidates with about 30% of the vote and edging out second-place finisher Robin Smith, who earned 28%.
On March 2010, Saltsman was also hired as top gubernatorial campaign consultant for South Carolina Lieutenant Gov. Andre Bauer. Bauer came in fourth among four candidates in the GOP primary on June.

Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881

The Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was one of the Licensing Acts 1828 to 1886. It required the closure of all public houses in Wales on Sundays. The Act had considerable political importance as a formal acknowledgement of the separate character of Wales, setting a precedent for future legislation and decisions. It was repealed in 1961.
Introduction of the legislation.
The legislation was introduced by the Liberal Government elected in 1880 under Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. It was the first Act since the union between England and Wales in 1535–42 which specifically applied only to Wales. A similar Bill which would have applied in England was rejected by Parliament. The 1881 Act did not apply to Monmouthshire, but was extended over that county in 1915 under wartime legislation which was reaffirmed in 1921. However, later Acts which were specific to Wales, including the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889, and the Welsh Cemeteries Act 1908, were also applied to Monmouthshire.
Background and effects.
The legislation followed pressure by the temperance movement and, in particular, the Nonconformist chapels. According to historian John Davies, the public houses in Wales had become "recruiting centres for the Conservative Party" following earlier Liberal legislation to restrict the licensed trade, and there was considerable backing among Welsh working class men to restrict their opening. However, one of the effects of the legislation was to encourage the opening of a large number of private social clubs which were excluded from it, and the legislation seems to have had little effect on drunkenness. According to Davies, "above all, legislation connected Welshness with negativity", and it became increasingly unpopular through the 20th century.
Repeal.
The Act was repealed through the Licensing Act 1961, which allowed local authorities in Wales to hold polls of their residents on the continuation of the ban. By 1996 all local government areas except Dwyfor in north west Wales had voted in favour of opening licensed premises on Sundays, and that year changes in local government boundaries resulted in the removal of the last ban. The requirement for regular polls on Sunday opening in Wales was abolished in 2003.

The Black House

The Black House (1981) is a collection of short stories by American author Patricia Highsmith. 
Overview.
An intense, macabre anthology focusing not only on murder, but also on more unusual crimes and misdemeanours that are beyond the reaches of prosecution. Told in Highsmith's typically impassive, lucid writing style, the work has been noted for its high degree of tension and, in some cases, surrealism.

Drow deities

The Dark Seldarine is the name given to the fallen, mostly evil deities of the subterranean drow in the "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game. They are not truly a pantheon in the same way the Seldarine are, though, as they do not co-operate. The Dark Seldarine are led by Lolth, whose power sometimes forces the others into obeying her. Their planes are various layers of the Abyss in 2nd Edition "D&D" and is the Demonweb Pits in the Third Edition cosmology.
The Dark Seldarine consists of:
Ghaunadaur.
Ghaunadaur ("gone"-ah-dowr) is also known as "That Which Lurks" and "The Elder Eye". Although officially considered a member of the drow pantheon, its followers include oozes, slimes, jellies, outcasts, and rebels. Most of its followers are lowly drow outcasts.
Overview.
Ghaunadaur is considered to be highly unpredictable by any standards. It is not always necessary to worship it; sometimes, simply paying lip service is enough to earn a boon from the god. However, this is not often done, as it's equally likely that it will consume or maim the penitent without warning.
"That Which Lurks" usually appears as a reddish-purple giant slug, though it can alter its form at will. Its symbol is a purple eye on purple, violet, and black circles. Priests of the Elder Eye are required to make daily sacrifices, preferably willing sacrifices. If a priest falls behind in their sacrifices, they are required to say a prayer while coating their hand in magical oil and lighting it on fire. If the prayer is good, the priest may keep the hand. If not, then the hand will be consumed by the Elder Eye.
It is generally discouraged for priests of Ghaunadaur to be friendly with other priests; however, the Underdark is full of strange things. More information on Ghaunadaur can be found in "The Drow of the Underdark," the TSR "AD&D" 2nd edition rulebook.
History.
Ghaunadaur is a very ancient deity, rumored to have emerged from the primordial ooze itself. In that age it was worshipped by the largest of slimes and other crawling creatures, many of which contained an alien intelligence. In a fit of fury due to Lolth spurning his romantic interests, Ghaunadaur struck most of them mad and took their intellects. As an unforeseen result, many of these worshipers ceased to exist, which caused The Elder Eye's power to collapse. Only in recent millennia have some evil beings turned back to Ghaunadaur, looking for an alternative to the established deities. Ghaunadaur is only a member of the drow pantheon because of the worship of drow that became disaffected with Lolth. in 1379 DR Ghaunadaur, finally fed up with Lolth, left the Demonweb Pits and created a new realm in the Deep Caverns. 
Selvetarm.
Selvetarm, known also as "The Spider that Waits" or "Lolth's Champion", is worshipped by few drow in the Underdark. The place where his worshippers are most common is the city of Eryndlyn. He is the patron of unequaled battle prowess and bloodlust. He cares only for battle and destruction everywhere, and he has a great hatred for all things living, although that is nothing compared to the hatred he has for his mistress Lolth.
Overview.
Selvetarm is a Chaotic Evil Demigod. His home plane is the Demonweb Pits, which in normal "Dungeons & Dragons" cosmology is the 66th layer of the Abyss, but in the revised D&D 3e "Forgotten Realms" cosmology is a plane to itself. His symbol is a crossed sword and mace over a spider, and his Third Edition D&D domains are Chaos, Drow, Evil, Spider, and War.
Worshipers.
The church of Selvetarm usually acts over the manifestation of soul spiders, and also common spiders. He manifests his pleasure by the discovery of stones, dried bark or webstone, and his anger by making pieces of weapon or armor break upon contact. All of the Selvertargtlin are trained in the sword in addition to the clerical skills. Although the church is mostly males, a handful of females worship Lolth's Champion.
In the "Forgotten Realms" setting there is a worshiper above Selvetarm's regular clerics known as a "Judicator", who is revered and feared as a master of the blade as well as for his (for they are exclusively male) clerical and/or arcane powers. Only one, known as Dhairn, has ever been mentioned, and he met his end at the hands of the Chosen of both Eilistraee and Mystra, Qilue Veladorn.
Manifestations.
When sending his avatar, the spider that waits appears as a large spider some of the time with the head of a drow male. He is known to wield a sword and mace in his front arms, and he can call upon the spells of all spheres.
The spider that waits rarely manifests himself in the realms, he prefers to either send his avatar or simply ignore the petitions of his supplicants, although he will manifest when his avatar is busy elsewhere. On those rare occasions, he manifests himself as a tiny sphere of utter darkness.
History.
Selvetarm was born from the brief union between Vhaeraun and Zandilar the Dancer (a demipower worshipped by elves in Yuirwood and later absorbed by Bast who would become Sharess), which was part of an elaborate plan to help Zandilar's followers against the attacks of Lolth's.
Selvetarm was alone for a time, until he was befriended by Eilistraee who showed him the ways of good, but all this would be short-lived as a result of the trickery of Lolth. The Spider Queen was enraged by the existence of a demonic lesser lord of the Abyss, who professed himself as having power over spiders, and whose name was Zanassu. Around this time the spider demon Zanassu had been weakened by a conflict in the Prime Material Plane, and so Lolth tricked Selvetarm into destroying the Abyssal lord and absorbing his divine power, under the false pretences of winning Eilistraee's gratitude. But in his actions Selvetarm also absorbed enough of Zanassu's malevolence to overcome his acquired goodness. Lolth used this to her advantage and entrapped Selvetarm's will, binding her grandson to her service.
Relationships.
Selvetarm is allied only with Lolth (grudgingly), and Garagos due to the similarity of their personalities and portfolios. He fiercely opposes his father Vhaeraun's machinations.
In Lisa Smedman's "Sacrifice of the Widow" (Wizards of the Coast, 2007), Selvatarm was slain by Cavatina, a mortal follower of Eilistraee wielding the Crescent Blade.
Vhaeraun.
Vhaeraun ( ), also known as the Masked Lord and the Masked God of Night, is the drow god of thievery, drow males, and evil activity on the surface world in many "Dungeons & Dragons" campaign settings. His worshipers include assassins, male drow and half-drow, poisoners, shadowdancers, rogues, and thieves.
Zinzerena.
Zinzerena is the drow deity of chaos and assassins. Her symbol is a shortsword draped in a black cloak, symbolizing her hidden menace. In the "Forgotten Realms" cosmology, she has been killed or banished by Lolth.

The 2002 United States Senate election in Texas was held on November 5, 2002. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Phil Gramm decided to retire, instead of seeking a fourth term. Republican John Cornyn won the open seat
Campaign.
Despite the fact that Texas is a red state, Kirk ran on a socially progressive platform: supporting abortion rights and opposing Bush judicial nominee Priscilla Owen, although Kirk was a former George W. Bush supporter. He also supported increases in defense spending, such as Bush's proposed $48 billion increase in military spending, except for the money Bush wanted to use for missile defense. Kirk had the support of former Governor Ann Richards and former U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen.
Cornyn was criticized for taking campaign money from Enron and other controversial companies. And although other Democrats have seized on the issue, Kirk is well-entrenched in the Dallas business community, and his wife resigned from two private-sector jobs that created potential conflicts of interest for Kirk while he was mayor. 
The race was close, as an October Dallas Morning News poll had Cornyn leading 47% to 37%. A record $18 million was spent in the election.

Henry B. Hidden

Henry B. Hidden (c. 1839, New York – March 9, 1862, Sangster's Station, Virginia) was a First Lieutenant in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Hidden is believed to be the first cavalry officer killed in action in the Army of the Potomac and the first officer of Union volunteer cavalry killed in the Civil War.
Biography.
Henry B. Hidden was born in New York to a wealthy family related to the shipwright William Henry Webb. He enlisted in the Union Army on August 5, 1861, at New York City in Company H, 1st New York Cavalry, a regiment also called the "Lincoln Cavalry." At some point, Hidden achieved the rank of First Lieutenant. On March 9, 1862, Hidden was ordered to take a small scouting party to investigate enemy activity near a bridge Union soldiers were building at Sangster's Station, a railroad station southwest of Fairfax Station, Virginia. Hidden and his party of 14 dragoons encountered an estimated 150 Confederate soldiers. Although vastly outnumbered, Hidden ordered a charge. In the resulting skirmish, he was shot in the neck and died soon afterward. The rest of the scouting party was wounded or captured.
Hidden was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.
Artistic depictions of Hidden's charge.
Hidden's charge sparked the imagination of several artists in subsequent years. Victor Nehlig painted "An Episode of the War — The Cavalry Charge of Lt. Henry B. Hidden" in 1875, and Frank Leslie illustrated the Sangster's Station skirmish in "The Soldier of Our Civil War" (1893). The former is on display in the New-York Historical Society's Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture.
Additionally, the "New York Evening Post" printed a poem inspired by his charge.

Sohan Halwa

Sohan Halwa ( Persian: سوهان Hindustani: सोहन हलवा / سوحن حلوى; ) is a traditional sweet in Iran, India and Pakistan. Sohan halwa is an example of Mughlai cuisine, and is popular in Delhi, Karachi and southern region of Pakistani Punjab including Multan and Dera Ghazi Khan.
It is made by boiling a mixture of water, sugar, milk and cornflour until it becomes solid. Saffron is used for flavoring. Ghee is used to prevent it from sticking to the pan. Almonds, pistachios and cardamom seeds are added. Unlike most other halwa dishes in the subcontinent, it is solid which is mainly due to its Persian roots.
History.
Sowhan is a very famous persian sweet. It has its root in ancient Persia hence no precise origin could be confirmed.
According to the Hafiz Halwa shop in Multan, Pakistan, sohan halwa originates from Dewan Sawan Mal, the ruler of Multan in 1750.
S.Abdul Khaliq states that this halwa was introduced by their ancestors in the sub-continent in the early 1500s when Mughal emperor Humayun (r. 1530–1540, 1555–1556) came back to power in India after being exiled in Persia. He called for the makers of this halwa from Persia and the ancestors of modern day S.Abdul Khaliq were the official halwa makers for the Mughal rulers for 300 years. S.Abdul Khaliq also have the term, "Shahi Halwa Sohan Merchants" as part of their branding.
Hafiz ka Multani Halwa shop said that they founded in 1930 in Multan, Hafiz ka Multani Sohan Halwa was started by Hafiz Ahmed Din in his pursuit of perfection and a complete and total passion for producing only the finest and healthiest Halwa ever made in the sub-continent. Hafiz Halwa is the only Sweet which has received two American Quality Awards due to its Quality & standard maintenance.
In Old Delhi, the Ghantewala sweet shop established during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, (r. 1759 - 1806) in 1790, now makes Sohan Halwa, and remains a popular visitors attraction.
Commercial production.
Sohan has been commercially produced by traditional confectioners for decades. It is brittle and caramel in color. It is usually made into disks of thickness or as square bite-size pieces. It is usually packaged in intricately designed tin cylinders. In recent years other packages have also been common.
Best quality Sowhan could be found in Iran, specially in the city of Qom.

Proctor Knott (horse)

Proctor Knott (foaled 1886 in Tennessee) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse gelding. His sire was the Hall of Famer Luke Blackburn, and his dam Tallapaloosa. He was bred by Belle Meade Stud and like his father who had been named for the then current governor of Kentucky, he was named for Governor J. Proctor Knott. He was owned during his racing career by George Scoogan and Sam Bryant.
Racing career.
Trained by co-owner, Captain Samuel W. Bryant, Proctor Knott had a career racing record of 26 starts, 11 wins, 6 seconds and 4 thirds, earning $80,350. In 1888, as a juvenile, he won the Junior Champion Stakes and the inaugural running of Futurity Stakes, which at the time was the richest race ever run in North America with a purse of $45,375, depending on which source you believe. He is listed by "Thoroughbred Heritage" as American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse of 1888. During his three year old campaign, Proctor Knott finished second in the Kentucky Derby as the 1-2 favorite behind Spokane. Proctor Knott false started twice, ran off and almost unseated his rider according to the official comments [http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2002/derby_history/derby_charts/years/1889.html] then raced wide and lost in a contested finish. He also ran second in the Omnibus Stakes at Monmouth Park behind Longstreet, the 1891 American Horse of the Year and son of the great Longfellow. He also ran second in the Clark Handicap, where the finishers came in just as they had in the Kentucky Derby.
Proctor Knott vs. Salvator.
Salvator, a member of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, was never able to defeat Proctor Knott. In Salvator's first start, the Junior Champion Stakes at Coney Island, Proctor Knott won while Salvator came in third. Three weeks later, their rivalry was renewed in the Futurity, where Proctor Knott again won. After this race, Proctor Knott was given time off while Salvator continued to race and won four more stakes. Their next and final meeting was in the Omnibus Stakes. While neither of them won, Proctor Knott did place ahead of Salvator. Salvator would go on to not taste defeat again in seven more races, while Proctor Knott won only two of his final nine races.
Proctor Knott's Legacy.
Proctor Knott died on the morning of August 6, 1891. The Proctor Knott Handicap was won in 1921 by Black Servant, a son of Black Toney. The race was conducted at Churchill Downs between 1920 and 1921.

The Adirondack varieties are unusual because both the skin and the flesh are colored and have high levels of anthocyanins. This variety is good for boiling, baking, and mashing and can be used for brightly colored salads. Unlike many blue potatoes, it does not turn grey after boiling. Adirondack Blue was bred from N40-1 (Chieftain x Black Russian) x NY96 and is not under plant variety protection. 
Adirondack Blue has large and spreading foliage. The stems and leaves are green with a bluish tint. The flowers are white. Tuber set is moderate and the tubers are round to oblong in shape, slightly flattened, with intermediate to shallow eyes. The skin and flesh are purple and the skin may be slightly netted. Tuber dormancy is short. The tubers can be used for chips, but cannot be chipped from cold storage. Unlike most potato varieties developed at Cornell over the past few decades, it is susceptible to golden nematode (Ro1). It is also susceptible to common scab, silver scurf, late blight, pink rot, leafhoppers, common potato viruses, Colorado potato beetle, Fusarium, and seed piece decay.
Penn State's alumni association is marketing potato chips in the school colors using the Adirondack Blue.

Thomas Traynor

Thomas Traynor, (27 May 1881 - 25 April 1921) was a member of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) hanged in Mountjoy Prison during the Irish War of Independence.
Background.
Traynor was from Tullow in County Carlow, Ireland, and was 39 at the time of his death. He was an experienced soldier having been a member of the Boland's Mill garrison during the Easter Rising, 1916. After the Rising he was interned in Frongoch and in Wakefield Jail where he shared a cell with Seán Mac Eoin.
He worked as a boot maker and was married with ten children. At the time of his death the eldest was 18 years and the youngest 5 months. Traynor's eldest son, Francis, represented Ireland at the 1928 Summer Olympics, competing as a bantamweight boxer.
Capture and execution.
Traynor was captured during an ambush on Auxiliaries in Brunswick Street, Dublin, on 14 March 1921, and tried on 5 April at City Hall. He was part of a party of IRA men keeping watch outside a meeting at 144 Brunswick street that included Seán MacBride. During the fight Volunteer Leo Fitzgerald was killed, as were Constable James O'Farrell and Cadet Bernard Beard of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. He was badly beaten by the Igoe Gang before execution. Dublin Castle seemed to consider the execution of Traynor mainly in terms of the impact it would have on Irish public opinion. From his diary extract, it would appear that Mark Sturgis a senior Civil Sevant of the Castle administration, seemed unaware that a hostage was being held in the event of Traynor being killed.
Traynor, captured red handed with an attacking party when Auxiliaries were killed in Brnswick Street, was executed this morning. I don't think they will make much fuss as there is no sort of 'alibi' business this time - nor is he the usual 'youth', dear to 'The Freeman', as he is over 40 and has a pack of children, the poor deluded idiot.
On the day following his death, Gilbert Potter, a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) District Inspector based in Cahir, Co. Tipperary, and being held for Traynor's safe treatment was executed in reprisal. Another IRA member, Jack Donnely, captured with Thomas was also sentenced to death but reprieved by the declaration of the truce in June 1921.
Remembered in popular culture.
In 1965 a statue was erected to Traynor in his native town of Tullow.
A song 'The Ballad of Thomas Traynor' was also written in his memory.
Reinterment.
Thomas Traynor was one of a group of men hanged in Mountjoy Prison in the period 1920-1921, commonly referred to as The Forgotten Ten. In 2001 he and the other nine, including Kevin Barry, were exhumed from their graves in the prison and given a full State Funeral. He is now buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.

William Control is an American electronic music project founded in 2008 in Seattle, Washington. It is a side project of Aiden’s William Francis. He was signed to Victory Records and has released three albums ("Hate Culture", "Noir" and "Silentium Amoris"), an EP ("Novus Ordo Seclorum"), and a live DVD "Live in London Town".
History.
Wil Francis formed William Control because he was interested in making music that didn't match the style of his other band, Aiden. In 2008 William Control released their debut album "Hate Culture" which is, as explained in a Kerrang! magazine interview, the story of a man named William Control and his last night on Earth because he wishes to kill himself. "Hate Culture" peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Electronic Albums chart and No. 43 on the Heatseekers chart. The band released a video for "Beautiful Loser" as the album's only single.
William Control toured with Escape The Fate on their "This War is Ours" tour in late 2008.
In 2009, William Francis began working on a new William Control album, titled "Noir", that was released on June 8, 2010. Francis invited his friends and fans to come up to the studio and record vocals for the new album, among whom is Ashley Costello of Orange County rock band New Years Day and Jeffree Star While its appearance on the album has yet to be confirmed, a teaser video featuring what appears to be the song "Deathclub" (a song that had only been released as a remix and has yet to be heard in its original form) was released by Wil via his social networking sites.
Francis also stated that he will be supporting Jeffree Star, and doing a headlining show the day after.
Alt Press magazine has stated "Noir" to be released on June 1 via victory records though Francis later stated that the release had been pushed back a week to the 8th of June. Francis also announced he was filming a video for "Noir"'s first single, "I'm Only Human Sometimes". The single for "I'm Only Human Sometimes", along with others was leaked 3 weeks before the release of "Noir".
On July 13, he released a spoken word track "Eleonora" (written by Edgar Allan Poe) on iTunes. He later released "The Tell Tale Heart" on September 13, "The Oval Portrait" on October 15, and "The Raven" on October 30, all of which are also written by Edgar Allan Poe.
Shortly after the release of "Noir" William Control left Victory Records, and founded his own record company called Control Records, based up in Seattle, Washington. William is currently recording all his music under this title.
On November 29, 2011, William Control announced, via his personal web page, that he will be releasing a new 5-track EP.entitled "Novus Ordo Seclorum". On the same day, he released a new book entitled Prose & Poems.
On January 26, 2012, he released the title of his third full-length album, "Silentium Amoris", to be released on April 2, 2012. William Control performed on the "Fight to Unite" US Tour, with Brokencyde and Blood on the Dance Floor in April and May 2012. In June 2012, he headlined the European "New Faith" tour, playing shows in the UK, Netherlands, and France. During this tour, he also headlined the Red Bull stage at Donnington's Download Festival. A music video for the first single off "Silentium Amoris", "Kiss Me Judas", was released on June 26, 2012 on YouTube.
In August and September 2012, William Control filmed a live DVD titled "Live in London Town", directed by Tim Bullock and produced by A Glass Half. The film features a live show, shot at the O2 Academy, Islington, as well as behind the scenes footage and interviews from two other dates.
In January 2013, William Control released his debut live album, "Live in London Town", featuring 20 tracks and a new unreleased track "Speak to Me of Abduction", which featured behind the scenes footage from the "Live in London Town" DVD. Also, he is taking part in The Church of the Wild Ones US Tour with Black Veil Brides as a special guest. William Control also stars in the film "Legion of the Black", a movie based upon the Black Veil Brides album "Wretched and Divine".
In March 2013, William Control asked again for donation to help fund his newest recording studio "Hell's Half Acre" from his official website. In return for a donation William Control gave those who donated his newest EP "Skeleton Strings", featuring 9 tracks of acoustic covers or original songs, including "Noir" and HIM's "The Funeral of Hearts".
In November 2013, William Control will be headlining the Friday night at Whitby Gothic Weekend
On October 1, 2013, William Control announced the title of his next studio album would be "The Neuromancer", and that it is slated for release in early December 2013 just before he embarks on a U.S. Tour, "Revel Without a Cause," as the opening act for The Used. Additionally, William announced that his book "Revelator: Book One The Neuromancer," would be shipped earlier than expected and likely within the first two weeks of the month. The book was sold exclusively through preorder, initially in a limited quantity of 500. However, the pre-orders sold so quickly that William announced the availability of an additional 100 copies shortly thereafter.

Frankoma Pottery

Frankoma Pottery was an American pottery company located in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. The company was widely known for its sculptures and dinnerware although the company made many other products including figurines, trivets, and vases. All Frankoma pottery was made in the United States from locally dug clay.
History.
Frankoma was founded by John Frank in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1933. Frank had been a professor in ceramics at the University of Oklahoma at Norman from 1927 to 1936 and used light-hued local Ada clay in his initial products. He moved the company to Sapulpa in 1938, only to soon rebuild that factory after a fire later that year. The name Frankoma was created from Frank's last name and the last three letters of the state of Oklahoma. 
The light Ada clay was replaced by brick-red local clay in 1953. John Frank operated the pottery with his wife Grace Lee Frank until his death in 1973. The factory was rebuilt in 1984 after a September 1983 fire destroyed most of the facility; the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1990. His daughter Joniece ran the pottery until 1991 when she was forced to sell the struggling company. In 1991 Richard Bernstein of Maryland purchased Frankoma and in 2005 sold the business to Det Merryman. 
The company was closed for six weeks and was sold again during the summer of 2008, reopening on August 18 with new owner Joe Ragosta. Ragosta planned to bring back all the employees and continue the Frankoma line of pottery. The year 2008 marked the company's 75 year anniversary. It closed in 2010 and then went on the auction block on May 18, 2011. Over a thousand pieces of pottery plus showroom fixtures and equipment were sold. The 1,800 original molds and the Frankoma name were not included in the sale. The real estate also was not part of the auction.
Oklahoma University's Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art opened an "Oklahoma Clay: Frankoma Pottery" exhibition in 2012, documenting Oklahoma culture through pottery.
As of December 2012, Frankoma Pottery was back in business according to a website at frankomapottery.com which currently no longer resolves.

24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstjäger

The 24th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Karstjäger" was a German mountain infantry division of the "Waffen"-SS, the armed wing of the German Nazi Party that served alongside but was never formally part of the Wehrmacht during World War II. Named "Karstjäger", it was one of the thirty-eight divisions fielded by the "Waffen"-SS. Formed on 18 July 1944 from the SS Volunteer "Karstwehr" Battalion, its nominal strength was never more than theoretical and the division was soon reduced to the "Waffen" Mountain ("Karstjäger") Brigade of the SS. Throughout its existence as a battalion, division and brigade, it was primarily involved in fighting partisans in the "Karst" region on the frontiers of Yugoslavia, Italy, and Austria; the mountainous terrain required specialized mountain troops and equipment.
Founded in 1942 as a company, the unit consisted mainly of Yugoslav "Volksdeutsche" and recruits from South Tyrol (in modern-day Italy). Although primarily focused on anti-partisan operations, it also saw action in the wake of the Italian surrender when it moved to disarm Italian troops in Tarvisio and protect ethnic German communities in Italy. In addition, at the end of the war it successfully fought to keep passes into Austria open, allowing German units to escape the Balkans and subsequently surrender to British forces. The remnants of the unit became some of the last Germans to lay down their arms when they surrendered to the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945.
History.
Origins.
In mid-1942, the "Waffen"-SS formed a company intended for anti-partisan operations in the rugged and high-altitude border region between Italy, Austria and Yugoslavia known as the "Karst". SS-"Standartenführer" (Colonel) Hans Brandt, a geologist and speleologist, suggested the creation of the unit. The company was formed at the SS training centre at Dachau on 10 July 1942 from soldiers of the supply services training and replacement battalion of the 23rd "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Kama" (2nd Croatian).
It was expanded to battalion strength of around 500 troops in November 1942, and as the SS-"Freiwilligen-Karstwehr" Battalion, it spent the first six months of 1943 training in Austria. The unit drew its recruits mainly from Yugoslav "Volksdeutsche" (ethnic Germans) and South Tyrolians, with the officer cadre being drawn from SS geological detachments. The battalion-strength "Waffen"-SS Geological Corps () from which such detachments were drawn had been formed in April 1941, and consisted mainly of engineers with a few geologists. They examined caves and natural obstacles, and determined whether off-road terrain was suitable for tanks. They were also responsible for locating sources of fresh water. Following the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the battalion was tasked with disarming Italian troops around Tarvisio on the border between the three countries. It then moved on to protective duties for nearby "Volksdeutsche" communities. From October 1943 until June 1944, the battalion was based at Gradisca d'Isonzo in Italy, and participated in anti-partisan operations in the areas of Trieste, Udine and the Istrian peninsula. On 10 October, a column of the battalion was ambushed at the Predil Pass, suffering three killed and eight wounded. The following day the battalion burned down the village of Strmc and killed 16 local men in retaliation. Up to 19 October 1943, the battalion suffered a total of 18 killed and 45 wounded in a series of engagements near the village of Flitsch. During the same period, the battalion captured two Italian mountain guns, which significantly increased its firepower.
During late October and November 1943, the battalion was engaged in anti-partisan operations around Saga and Karfreit, including Operation "Traufe" (Eaves). In late November, the battalion was placed under the command of the Supreme SS and Police Leader, Italy, "SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS" (Lieutenant General) Karl Wolff for an operation. In February 1944, the battalion conducted Operation "Ratte" (Rat), during which it burned down the villages of Komen and Rihenberg, and interned the population of both villages in labour camps. Early in 1944, Brand suggested that Slovene nationalists be recruited into the battalion, but the idea was rejected by SS headquarters, who feared that such a policy would allow the infiltration of the unit by Yugoslav Partisans. At this stage, it was estimated that there were about 20,000 communist partisans operating in the Gorizia region. During March 1944, the battalion was involved in a rapid series of named operations, including "Zypresse" (Cypress), "Märzveilchen" (Violet), "Maulwurf" (Mole) and "Hellblau" (Light Blue), resulting in significant guerilla casualties, as well as executions of captured partisans. In March and April, Operation "Osterglocke" (Daffodil) was conducted over 12 days, followed by Operation "Liane" in late May, and the long-running Operation "Annemarie" which covered the period 7 May to 16 July 1944. In June 1944, a patrol from the battalion failed to return from a task in the vicinity of Cividale del Friuli. Two days later, they were located with their torsos stripped naked and their severed heads impaled on bayonets. The unit became known for shooting suspected partisans. While engaged in anti-partisan work, the battalion grew to a strength of around 1,000.
Expansion.
On 18 July 1944, "Reichsführer"-SS Heinrich Himmler ordered that the battalion be expanded to divisional size, although the authorised strength was only 6,600 troops. The 24th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Karstjäger" was to be established by the Higher SS and Police Leader () for the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral, SS-"Gruppenführer" (Major General) Odilo Globocnik. The name "Karstjäger" was derived from a combination of "Karst", denoting the region of operations, and "Jäger", the German military term for light infantry. The division was to consist of two "Gebirgsjäger" (mountain infantry) regiments, with an artillery regiment, reconnaissance, "Panzerjäger" (anti-tank) and pioneer battalions, as well as replacement and supply troops. The division was supplied with 14 captured Italian Carro Armato P 40 tanks, but these proved unreliable, with only half being serviceable at any one time. In August 1944, the under-strength division participated in Operation "Dachstein" under the command of the 188th Mountain Division. Between August and November 1944, the division continued performing anti-partisan duties in the same region, but its strength had only reached 3,000, less than half of its authorised establishment. It proved impossible to recruit sufficient troops for the division, and in December 1944 the division was downgraded to a brigade.
During late 1944 and early 1945, the "Waffen" Mountain ("Karstjäger") Brigade of the SS fought first against British-supported partisans in the Julian Alps, and was then deployed to the coastal area around Trieste and the Marano-Grado Lagoon. In danger of being cut off by Allied forces, the brigade soon returned to the Julian Alps, having to fight its way through the Tagliamento river valley between Osoppo and Gemona. Toward the end of April 1945, the brigade fought British and New Zealand forces on the southern fringe of the Julian Alps. The brigade replacement company, which had been sent to Cividale from Pottenstein, managed to destroy a number of British tanks with panzerfausts and the assistance of a tank company. In the final weeks of the war the brigade was part of a "Kampfgruppe" (battlegroup) commanded by SS-"Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen"-SS (Brigadier) Heinz Harmel, which was ordered to keep the Karawanken passes open between Yugoslavia and Austria. This task was critical in allowing German forces to withdraw from Yugoslavia in order to surrender to British rather than Yugoslav forces. The "Kampfgruppe" succeeded in its final task, and was one of the last German units to surrender, when it encountered the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945.
Order of battle.
On paper, the division's final order of battle was to consist of:
The division establishment also included supply units. However, only the 59th "Waffen Gebirgsjäger" Regiment, one battalion of the 24th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment, one company of the 24th SS Pioneer Battalion and a half-company of the divisional panzer company were ever established.
Commanders.
According to Gordon Williamson, three "Waffen"-SS officers commanded the division and subsequently the brigade:
In contrast, Roland Kaltenegger only lists Hahn as commanding the unit.
Uniform.
The unit insignia was a stylised Týr rune with arrows pointing to the left and right. A collar insignia was manufactured, but it is believed that these were never issued or worn, and the members of the division wore the Sig runes.

In 1907, McCracken took a position as head of the chemistry department at Michigan's Western State Normal School in Kalamazoo (now called Western Michigan University). He remained at Western Michigan until his retirement in 1939, also serving as acting university president in the 1922–23 school year. In 1946, the school began plans for McCracken Hall to honor his legacy.
McCracken offered his services wherever he believed he could add value to the school and its students. In yet another string of "firsts", he was the first faculty advisor for the "Western Herald" student newspaper in 1916.

Xiaotang Mountain Han Shrine

The Xiaotang Mountain Han Shrine () also known as the "Guo Family Ancestral Hall" (, literally "Xiaotang Mountain Guo Family Tomb Stone Ancestral Hall") is a funerary stone shrine from the early Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD) situated on slopes of the Yellow River valley in the western part of Shandong Province, China. It is the only known offering shrine from this period known to be still standing in its original form. The Xiaotang Mountain Shrine has 
been identified with as the Guo Family shrine by some studies, linking it to the story of Guo Ju, the 
13th of the Confucian Twenty-four paragons filial piety ().
History.
Funerary shrines have been built on top of the tombs of members of the 
upper nobility and feudal lords since 
the Warring States period (475-221 BC). Erecting such shrines as 
well as monumental towers became popular during the times of the Han Dynasty (207 BC-220 AD) and in particular in the era of the 
Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD). The Xiaotang Mountain Han Shrine dates 
to the early Eastern Han Dynasty, but the exact date remains 
unknown. Historical inscriptions that were added 
to the shrine suggest that it dates back before the year 129 AD (the 
4th year of the reign of the Eastern Han Emperor Shun of Han), to 
which the earliest inscription on the shrine is dated. The second oldest inscription date is the 
year when Emperor Huan of Han of the Eastern Han changed his era 
name to "Yongkang" (, in 
167 AD). The shrine is mentioned in the 
"Commentary to the River Classic" (Shui Jing Zhu) by the 
Northern Wei Dynasty scholar Li Daoyuan (died 527 AD). The shrine is also recorded in the 
"Catalogue of Inscriptions on Stone and Bone" by Zhao Mingcheng 
(, 1081-1129 AD), a 
scholar-official and epigraphist in the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) also known for being the husband to poetess Li Qingzhao. The shrine was among the first 180 sites to be included in the list of national heritage sites () on April 3, 1961.
Shrine.
The Xiaotang Mountain Han Shrine is a free-standing masonry construction 
topped by a single-eaved and hanging hill-shaped roof. It that stands long, 
are thick. An 
-tall octagonal stone pillar has been placed in the 
center of the shrine. The shrine is decorated with sunken images cut away from a surface as 
well as bas-relief images. The stone walls and the 
triangular stone girders are engraved with depictions of legendary 
tales, historic events, time keeping and astrology, royal audiences, 
travel, guest receptions, war campaigns, hunting, cooking, and 
recreation. Other architectural 
components of the shrine carry simpler decorations with motives such 
as lowered curtains and water chestnut. An inscription of particular cultural history and calligraphic 
value is the "Odes to Moving Filial Piety" (Gan Xiao Song) written by 
King of Longdong in the Northern Qi Dynasty (550-577 AD) and 
engraved on the outside gable of the shrine.
Filial piety.
The shrine has been identified with the story of Guo 
Ju (), the 13th of the 24 
Paragons of Filial Piety. Guo Ju is said 
to have lived during the time of the Han Dynasty. He prepared to bury 
his own infant son during a period of food shortage in order to 
preserve enough food to save his aging mother. When he dug the grave 
for his son, he found a treasure (inscribed as a gift to him) that 
allowed him to save his entire family.
Location.
The Xiaotang Mountain Han Shrine is located on Xiaotang Mountain 
(, literally "Filial Piety Hall Mountain"). Other names of the 
mountain are "Guishan" (, literally "Tortoise Mountain") and "Wushan" (, literally "Witch 
Mountain"). The mountain is located 
south of the village of Xiaolipu (), in Changqing District 
() under the administration 
of Jinan City. It slightly more than southeast 
of the city center of Jinan. It is located about 
to the east of the Yellow River and about west of 
road G220.

Iskra (Egyptian communist organisation)

Iskra (, "ash-Sharara") was a communist organization in Egypt. "Iskra" was founded in 1942 by Hillel Schwartz. In the initial phase of its existence, the membership of "Iskra" was a few tens.
The followers of "Iskra" were, like the supporters of other Egyptian communist factions, active inside the Wafdist Vanguard (see Wafd).
"Iskra" emphazised studies of Marxist theory and its application in Egyptian society. The approach of "Iskra" was that the first task of the communists was to build a base amongst revolutionary intellectuals, and that mass mobilisation would follow at a later stage.
In 1944 "Iskra" established a study centre, "Dar al-abahth al-'ilmiya" (دار الأبحاث العلمية, House of Scientific Research). The centre published literature and gave classes on communist thought.
In 1945 "Iskra" was one of the forces behind the foundation of the National People's University, an institution that provided courses in politics and social sciences for labour activists.
In February 1946, "Iskra" was one of the groups that organised the National Committee of Workers and Students, a mass movement for national independence and social reforms. The National Committee lasted until July the same year.
In 1947 began publishing the newspaper "al-Jamahir" (الجماهير, 'The Masses'). Shudi Atiya ash-Shafi was the director of the House of Scientific Research and later the editor of "al-Jamahir". Ash-Shafi had been the first Egyptian Muslim to become part of the "Iskra" leadership.
In 1947 "Iskra" merged with the Egyptian Movement for National Liberation (HAMITU) to form the Democratic Movement for National Liberation.
Social profile.
In comparison to other contemporary communist organisations in Egypt, the membership of "Iskra" largely consisted of intellectuals. Like all communist groups, the cadres were mainly urban and based in the Cairo area. A large number of the "Iskra" cadres were Europeanised Jews or belonging to other European minorities. Many of the "Iskra" activists belonged to the upper strata of Cairo society, and were often recruited from the Lycée Français du Caire. The recruitment was often done through arranging parties and social events. In 1945, "Iskra" had a membership of about 900. 40% of them were foreigners.
Notably the Jewish members of the "Iskra" leadership took a more militant anti-Zionist approach that non-Jewish cadres. Around 1946/early 1947 they formed the Jewish Anti-Zionist League.
It was in "Iskra" that the first female communists were organized in Egypt. Some of the first women cadres were Latifa az-Zayyat, Soraya Adham, Fatma Zaki, Inge Aflatun, Aimée Setton and Odette Hazan Solomon.
The "Iskra" group soon got the reputation of being a haven for sexual libertinism. In fact the anti-communist discourse in Egypt at the time, which was centered around claims that the communist movement was morally depraved and dominated by Jews, was largely based on the reputation of the "Iskra" group. Other communist factions became harshly critical of "Iskra", especially the role of women in the organisation. Henri Curiel, leader of HAMITU, criticized "Iskra" for organizing parties as a tool for political recruitment.

Sixteenth HD1080

Sixteenth HD1080 (or HD1080/16) is a display resolution that is the same aspect ratio and one 16th the area of 1080 line high-definition TV resolution.
HD1080 is 1920x1080 pixels, so dividing the resolution by 4 in each axis gives 480x270 pixels. This is a computationally convenient process, as HD1080 content can be scaled down simply by summing blocks of 16 pixels and dividing by 16 (arithmetic shift right 4 bits).
HD720 is 1280x720 pixels, i.e. 2/3 the resolution of HD1080 in each axis. HD720
content thus needs to be scaled by a factor of 3/8 in each axis, producing 3x3 pixels for every 8x8 pixels in. This is not as easy as scaling HD1080 content.
In practice, these displays are made with 272 rows of pixels where it is more convenient to manufacture pixels in multiples of 8x8. It also helps image compression and decompression, which is commonly done on 8x8 or 16x16 blocks of pixels.
Applications.
Sixteenth HD1080 displays are generally intended for Portable Media Players, where they are well suited to showing scaled-down HD1080 content that is the coming standard in media (e.g. Blu-ray discs).
The PlayStation Portable uses a 480x272 display, suggesting potential use as a Portable Media Player as well as a games machine.
Microsoft's Zune HD uses a 480x272 OLED display to properly scale HD video when it is being displayed on the device.

B'nai Jeshurun (Manhattan)

B'nai Jeshurun is a synagogue in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City.
History.
Founded in 1825, Bnai Jeshurun was the second synagogue founded in New York and the third-oldest Ashkenazi synagogue in the United States.
The synagogue was founded by a coalition of young members of congregation Shearith Israel and immigrants and the descendants of immigrants from the German and Polish lands. It was the stated intention to follow the "German and Polish "minhag" (rite)." The order of prayers followed that of the Ashkenazi Great Synagogue of London and sought the guidance of the British chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschell on matters of ritual. The congregation dedicated its first building on Elm Street in Manhattan in 1827.
The first rabbi, Samuel Isaacs, was appointed in 1839. By 1850, the congregation had grown large enough to make it necessary to build a new synagogue on Green Street.
In 1865, the congregation moved yet again, to a new building on 34th Street, the parcel later part of the site of the flagship Macy's store. Driven by the rapid expansion of the city, they moved yet again in 1885 to Madison Avenue at 65th Street. That building was designed by Rafael Guastavino and Schwarzmann & Buchman.
The present building, located at 257 West 88th Street between Broadway and West End Avenue was dedicated in 1917. It was designed by Henry B. Herts, a congregant and celebrated theater architect, with Walter S. Schneider. In addition to its place on the National Register of Historic Places, the synagogue was included in the New York City Riverside Drive-West End Historic District created in 1990. The muqarna-studded ceiling was redesigned following its collapse during renovations in the early 1990s and was replaced with a future-invoking space frame back-lit to simulate a nighttime sky [http://ohny.wordpress.com/2010/07/02/field-trip-friday-congregation-bnai-jeshurun/].
Breakaway congregations.
B'nai Jeshurun's original founders broke from the city's only synagogue, Shearith Israel, in 1825, in order to create an Ashkenazi congregation. Subsequently, B'nai Jeshurun members broke away to form new shuls several times.
In 1828, at a time of rapid growth in the New York Jewish community, a group left B'nai Jeshurun to found Ansche Chesed.
In 1845, Temple Shaaray Tefila was founded by 50 primarily English and Dutch Jews who had been members of B'nai Jeshurun. 
Affiliation.
B'nai Jeshurun took a leading role in founding the Board of Directors of American Israelites in 1859. When the Board of Delegates merged with the (Reform) Union of American Hebrew Congregations in 1878 the congregation went along, but in 1884 it left the Reform Movement. Two years later, it also supported the founding of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) in 1886, a school formed to support Orthodoxy in combating the Reform movement.
In 1889, the congregation published its own edition of the prayer book.
When Solomon Schechter used JTS to create a more conservative set of reforms to traditional Judaism, B'nai Jeshurun joined his United Synagogue of America, now the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.
In the 1990s the congregation left the Conservative movement and is now independent.
Contemporary.
A spiritual and demographic renaissance began in 1985, with the arrival of Rabbi Marshall Meyer.
