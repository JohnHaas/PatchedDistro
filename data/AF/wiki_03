List of Life on Mars (U.S. TV series) episodes

This is an episode list for the US version of the television show "Life on Mars". This is a US remake of the BBC show also entitled "Life on Mars".
Originally 13 episodes were commissioned for the first season after the first failed pilot. ABC announced on November 20, 2008 that 4 more episodes had been commissioned, bringing the total number of episodes for the first season to 17. The first season went on hiatus over Christmas after the seventh episode, "The Man Who Sold the World", with a cliffhanger ending. When the series returned, the episode concluding the cliffhanger (the eighth episode, "The Dark Side of the Mook") was aired second, after "Take A Look At The Lawmen" (chronologically the eleventh episode).
On March 2, 2009, it was announced that ABC would not be ordering a second season, cancelling the series. The decision was made early in order to give the producers enough time to wrap up the show's storyline. The final episode, "Life Is a Rock", aired on April 1, 2009.

Tilhas Tizig Gesheften

Tilhas Teezee Gesheften (commonly known by its acronym TTG) was the name of a group of Jewish Brigade members formed immediately following World War II. Under the guise of British military activity, this group engaged in the assassination of Nazis and SS conspirators, facilitated the illegal emigration of Holocaust survivors to Israel, and smuggled weaponry for the Haganah.
Philology.
The three words that make up the phrase are Arabic ["tilhas tizi", "تِلحسْ طِيزي"] and Yiddish ["gesheften /געשעפטן] combined to form a modern Hebrew slang expression, meaning "You lick my ass business." It has been more colloquially translated as "up your ass/Götveren".
History.
Background.
Following the collapse of Nazi Germany and before the establishment of the State of Israel, the majority of Jews in Europe were living without clarification of their legal and national statuses. The majority of them were classified as displaced persons, though where they were displaced from and where they ought to be relocated to were points of contention. The official position of the Haganah, as defined by David Ben-Gurion and the Jewish Agency, was that European Jewry had been treated so differently that its members needed to continue to be differently treated. Therefore, in opposition to the policies of quota immigration imposed by the British White Paper, they sought to permit and facilitate unlimited Jewish immigration of Holocaust survivors to Mandate Palestine.
Origins.
The TTG Brigade was created by Israel Carmi, who was an officer of the Jewish Brigade while concurrently acting as a senior representative of the then-underground Haganah. Carmi was initially engaged in revenge operations against those believed to have been responsible, at least in part, for the Shoah. Along with certain of his fellow soldiers in the Jewish Brigade, he was responsible for executing hundreds of Germans, Austrians, and Italians. Most of these were identified by Carmi and his men as having been active members of the SS or otherwise as having assisted in the deportation or extermination of Jews within the Nazi sphere of influence.
The TTG Brigade came into existence when Carmi falsely identified himself at a checkpoint to confuse a sentry and allow him and his companions to have unhindered passage. It led to the creation of fictional paperwork, seals, passes, orders, requisition forms, and even unit uniforms and insignia.
Evolution.
As Carmi's goals shifted from revenge to rescue, so too did the TTG Brigade become more and more an instrument for the liberation of displaced persons and their eventual passage to Palestine. The function of the TTG was first and foremost to provide the illusion of official status before occupying Allied forces. This allowed the members of the Brigade to engage in rescue activities without undue interruption or objection from the occupying powers. Purporting to act as if they were under orders as part of the TTG Brigade allowed its members to pass through roadblocks, military checkpoints, and international borders, often with large numbers of displaced Jews in their care.
The second function of the group, which developed over time, was to extract from the Allied forces the greatest quantity of material and personnel assistance for the rescue efforts of the Brigade's members. This included the fictional group's requisition and use of civilian and military vehicles, gasoline, rations, medical supplies, and other such materiel. The Brigade was also involved, with the assistance of false TTG paperwork, in the acquisition of large quantities of small arms and other martial equipment for use by the Haganah in Palestine. 
Dissolution.
The first goal of the group, illegal emigration, became less important as military control of civilian movement became less strict. The group's Zionist goals, centering on illegal immigration to Palestine ("ha-apalah"), became obsolete with the acceptance of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the establishment of Israel as a recognized state. As more and more allied forces withdrew from Europe, fewer resources were available for acquisition by the members of TTG. Likewise, as war between Israel and her neighbors loomed, the military skills they had accumulated encouraged withdrawal of most of them to serve as officers in the newly formed Israeli Defense Forces. 
Most of the Jews who were "rescued" in this manner made aliyah to Israel, where they settled in the cities or else became kibbutzniks. Many of these actively supported the war effort during the Israeli War of Independence. The arms and materials stolen by the TTG contributed to the Israeli war effort and warmaking capacity. Most of the "members" of the TTG Brigade entered service in the Haganah and fought as part of the IDF during the war.

Little Tom Mountain

Little Tom Mountain is a nature preserve in Holyoke, Massachusetts and is managed by the Trustees of Reservations. The land was purchased in 2002 by a joint effort of the Trustees of Reservations, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Department of Conservation and Recreation, and the Holyoke Boys & Girls Club from the holders of the former Mt. Tom Ski area. It is not yet open to the public due to a nearby quarry operation, but expects to be open by 2012.
Ancient History.
Evidence of early occupants of the area can be found in the dinosaur fossil tracks in the sandstone bedrock at Dinosaur Footprints Reservation to the east of Little Tom. Eubrontes giganteus, Anchisauripus sp., and Grallator cuneatus, all bipedal theropods, lived in this area some 200 million years ago. Although no fossil tracks are known to be visible on Little Tom, undoubtedly many are preserved deep within the sandstone layers on the property.
Little Tom overlooks glacial Lake Hitchcock, which was formed in the present Connecticut River basin as the retreating Laurentide ice sheet deposited sediments near Rocky Hill, CT, damming the Connecticut River basin. Glacial meltwater filled Lake Hitchcock for over 4,000 years until about 14,000 years ago. Recent discoveries have placed early Native Americans just to the south of the glacial ice sheet 18,000 years ago. These peoples pushed north as the ice sheet retreated. They were ancestors of the Pocumtuck tribe, which lived and thrived in the Connecticut River Valley until the arrival of the Europeans. There is no known evidence of use of Little Tom by the Pocumtucks.
History.
In 2002, four entities joined together to acquire and protect the 396 acres on the eastern slope of Mt. Tom that had previously been home to the Mt. Tom ski area. This protection effort was led by the Department of Conservation and Recreation , and ultimately included the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Holyoke Boys & Girls Club, and The Trustees of Reservations. These 396 acres included the existing quarry site, which was slated to expand to 90 acres. The land transaction negotiations were lengthy and difficult, but were ultimately successful.
Each organization/agency purchased a portion of the property as follows:
Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) purchased 144.7 acres for $1.3 million, mostly along the northern side of the property abutting the existing Mount Tom State Reservation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acquired 140.8 acres for $1.1 million, covering most of the area previously managed for ski slopes.’ The Trustees purchased 73.5 acres of the hill called ‘Little Mountain’ or ‘Little Tom’, between the base lodge and I-91, for $300,000 and The Holyoke Boys & Girls Club purchased 21.7 acres at the base of the mountain, including the base lodges, wave pool, and other improvements, for $300,000 for use as a summer camp.
Also, the quarry operation was allowed to continue, but was contained within a nine acre area. DCR received an option to purchase the quarry parcel, which totals 16 acres, on or after August 31, 2012 or after two million tons of stone were removed.
The four organizations have agreed to coordinate management of the 396 acres and will eventually develop a Memorandum of Understanding that outlines the management goals and responsibilities of the partnership. In general, it is expected that United States Fish & Wildlife Service, Department of Conservation and Recreation, and The Trustees of Reservations will manage their properties for natural and cultural resources, and the Holyoke Boys & Girls Club is expected to open a summer camp on their 21 acres (including the former ski lodges and outbuildings) once the quarry operation ceases.
Landscape.
The Mt. Tom ridge is part of the Metacomet Range. The bedrock underlying these ridges resembles a layered cake of alternating layers of basalt and sandstone. The ridge adjacent to Mt. Tom to the SSW is called East Mountain. The line of ridges crosses the Connecticut River at the north end of Mt. Tom, and continues with a bend to the NE towards the Holyoke Range. East Mountain and the Holyoke Range share many of the interesting and significant geologic and biological characteristics that are described in this document.
The bulk of the Mt. Tom ridge consists of an exposed layer of basalt. From the air, the ridge looks like a vast, flat tabletop, leaning mostly to the east and a little to the south. The slopes of the former Mount Tom Ski Area, which are mostly on United States Fish and Wildlife Service land, descend this tilted tabletop roughly from west to east. The west edge of the Mt. Tom ridge is a sharp escarpment of cliffs and talus slopes. This feature gives rise to the common name traprock, which is derived from the Swedish word for step.
The Metacomet-Monadnock Trail follows the top edge of this escarpment, and it provides a long sequence of spectacular views toward the west. Away from the edge of the escarpment, the topography near the top of the main ridge is a landscape of small outcrops and ledges alternating with hollows, which sometimes hide vernal pools.
To the east, between Mt. Tom and I-91, there is a much smaller and somewhat more rounded version of the main ridge. It is appropriately named Little Mountain on the USGS topographic map and is also commonly called Little Tom Mountain. The traprock layer at the top of Little Tom Mountain is younger than the traprock layer that makes up the main slope of Mt. Tom and the sandstone layer in between these two layers subsides below the surface of Little Tom Mountain.
The former Mount Tom Ski Area property is a long trapezoid/rectangle, which begins at the top of the ridge at the west escarpment, descends the slopes of the main ridge, climbs over Little Tom Mountain, and ends close to I-91 at its eastern boundary. Within the parcel, DCR land is a fairly narrow strip along the northern parcel boundary, adjacent to the Mt. Tom State Reservation to the north. USFWS land is in the SW quadrant of the parcel, and covers most of the former ski slopes. The Trustees’ Little Tom Reservation is the northern half of Little Tom Mountain, of which the southern half is Department of Conservation and Rrecreation land. The quarry, which will continue its operation for several years, is west of Little Tom Mountain, at its base, and directly north of the Boys & Girls Club land.
With the exception of the ski slopes and a couple of small fields, most of the landscape is forested. The forest on the main ridge is mostly deciduous, and on Little Tom Mountain it is mostly a mixed forest of hemlock, hardwoods, and some white pine. The ski slopes and some fields are in a non-woody old-field condition and the old field next to “the billboard” (a billboard overlooking I-91 at the NE corner of Trustees land) is dominated by Red Cedar, shrubs, saplings, and Swallowwort.
The deciduous forests are for the most part typical, dry, fairly acidic, oak-dominated forests. Often they are relatively open forests, with a low, patchy canopy and an ericaceous shrub layer. Scattered along the main slope and in places on the southern end of the Little Tom Mountain ridgetop there are pockets of richer, more neutral soil, often associated with seeps, where a relatively sparse shrub layer and a more diverse ground cover of sedges, herbs, and ferns, and some rare plants occur – these are pleasant places to walk.
There are a dozen and a half vernal pools throughout the property , a reservoir, several ponds, a stream which flows down the main slope and then north into Lake Bray, a number of intermittent streams, and numerous seeps. The large vernal pool at the top of Little Tom Mountain is a classic, perfect example of a confined-basin pool.
Wildlife.
Birds
United States Fish and Wildlife Service conducted a breeding land bird survey in 2003. A total of 75 species of birds were sighted on the property during the 2003 survey. An initial scouting survey conducted in May 2003 revealed that a great diversity of migratory songbirds use Mt. Tom for stopover habitat. Species sighted during that time include Blackburnian Warbler, Black-throated Blue Warbler, Blue-winged Warbler, Northern Parula, and Yellow-rumped Warbler. None of these species were counted during the landbird breeding survey. Early migratory stopover studies will be conducted by USFWS in subsequent years to further assess the use of Mt. Tom by neo-tropical migrants for stopover habitat.
Amphibians and Reptiles
The Mount Tom ridge is an extremely important habitat for amphibians and reptiles. Thirty-eight species of amphibians and reptiles have been recorded on the Mount Tom ridge, representing 76% of all herpetological species found in Massachusetts. Of these, the rarest species include marbled salamander, box turtle, wood turtle, copperhead, timber rattlesnake, and Western rat snake.
A vernal pool survey was conducted on three days in April 2003. Ten amphibian species were found, including four obligate vernal pool species, and two state-listed species. The most significant vernal pool is on top of Little Tom Mountain, on the Little Tom Reservation. It is an isolated pool, far from any neighbors, and as expected, a large number of Spotted Salamander and Wood Frog egg masses were found there. This vernal pool is a very significant ecological resource.
In the course of doing botanical survey work in 2003, box turtles, painted turtles, and black racers were found. Given anecdotal evidence, available habitats, and historical records, it is likely that the entire area of the Partners’ properties is used by northern copperheads and timber rattlesnakes. There is also the possibility of a few den sites of copperheads on the properties.
Invasive Species.
The 2003 botanical survey included some effort to determine the status of invasive plant species in our properties. The following plant species list was compiled:
Recreation.
At present, Little Tom Mountain is not open to the public. Reservation access is limited to special programs and volunteer workdays until the reservation formally opens in 2013.

Chapman Partnership

Chapman Partnership is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3), private sector partner of the Miami-Dade County, Florida Homeless Trust. In October 2011, CPH changed its name to Chapman Partnership in honor of its founding chairman, the late Alvah Chapman, Jr., commissioned to site, build and operate two Homeless Assistance Centers in downtown Miami and Homestead. 
History.
Alvah Chapman, Jr., former CEO of Knight Ridder, was asked by the late Governor Lawton Chiles to chair the Governor’s Commission on Homeless. The Commission was charged with developing and beginning implementation of the strategic plan to serve the homeless in Miami-Dade County, which became the Miami-Dade County Community Homeless Plan. The Governor’s Commission on Homeless worked cooperatively with the Miami-Dade Legislative Delegation and the Metro County Commission to ensure the passage and implementation of a one percent food and beverage tax in larger restaurants to fund homeless programs. The Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust collects and distributes the tax dollars and oversees the implementation of the Plan.
Chapman Partnership was incorporated in 1993 as Community Partnership for Homeless.
Facilities.
Chapman Partnership has two Homeless Assistance Centers – 1550 North Miami Avenue, Miami (North Center) and 28205 SW 124 Court, Homestead (South Center). With fully equipped medical and dental clinics, family dorms, conference rooms, cafeterias, classrooms, day care centers, a basketball court and even a dog kennel.
Programs & Services.
Chapman Partnership provides a wide array of programs that go beyond just emergency shelter to 800 men, women and children daily. They include comprehensive case management, health and dental care, day care, job development and training, job placement, permanent housing assistance and other help from a variety of social service agencies – all under one roof. 800,000 meals are served annually and over 340 households have been placed with Federal Stimulus dollars since October 2009.
All residents are referred to the facilities by the Miami-Dade County Homeless Outreach. Upon referral, the intake process begins with registration and a full evaluation of their situation, including a health screening, dental screening, assignment of a bed and case manager, and the initial formation of a goal plan to advance their ability to seek more permanent housing and, if necessary, employment.
Children are registered for school and/or enrolled in on-site programs. Assistance with forms for Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security & Disability are provided as needed.

Vagadheeswari

Vagadheeswari (pronounced vāgadheeśwari) is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the 34th "melakarta" rāgam (parent scale) in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called Bhogachhāyānāţa in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 4th rāgam in the 6th "chakra Rutu". The mnemonic name is "Rutu-Bhu". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ru gu ma pa dhi ni". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
The "swaras shatsruthi rishabham, antara gandharam, shuddha madhyamam, chathusruthi dhaivatham" and "kaisiki nishadham" are used in this scale. As "Vagadheeshwari" is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "shuddha madhyamam" equivalent of "Nasikabhooshani", which is the 70th "melakarta" scale.
"Janya" rāgams.
"Vagadheeshwari" has a few minor "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it, of which "Magadhi" and "Mohanāngi" are occasionally heard. See List of "janya" rāgams for full list of rāgams associated with Vagadheeswari.
Compositions.
Here are a few common compositions sung in concerts, set to "Vagadheeshwari".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Vagadheeshwari's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 2 other minor "melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Naganandini" and "Bhavapriya". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. For further details and an illustration refer "Graha bhedam on Naganandini".

Parakeratosis

Parakeratosis is a mode of keratinization characterized by the retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum. In mucous membranes, parakeratosis is normal. In the skin, this process leads to the abnormal replacement of annular squames with nucleated cells. Parakeratosis is associated with the thinning or loss of the granular layer and is usually seen in diseases of increased cell turnover, whether inflammatory or neoplastic. Parakeratosis is seen in the plaques of psoriasis and in dandruff.
Granular parakeratosis (originally termed axillary granular parakeratosis) is an idiopathic, benign, nondisabling cutaneous disease that manifests with intertriginous erythematous, brown or red, scaly or keratotic papules and plaques. It presents in all age groups and has no established clinical associations.

New Fork, Wyoming

New Fork is a ghost town in Sublette County, Wyoming, United States, near Boulder. It was one of the earliest settlements in the upper Green River valley. New Fork was established in 1888 by John Vible and Louis Broderson, Danish immigrants who had arrived in the United States in 1884. They established a store along the Lander cut-off of the Oregon Trail. By 1908 a small town had grown around the store, and in 1910 Vible built a dance hall, called The Valhalla. 
In the early years of the settlement the local Bannock and Shoshoni Indians from the Wind River Indian Reservation accounted for much of the town's trade. Vible and Broderson's original store was a log cabin, selling supplies obtained in Evanston.
The death of Vible and members of his family from diphtheria and scarlet fever in 1915 started a decline, exacerbated by the abandonment of the Lander cut-off. Mail service stopped in 1918.
Several log and frame buildings remain in the townsite.

Biography.
Feldman received his undergraduate degree from Trinity College, Hartford, CT in 1946 and his master’s degree the following year. In 1951, he received his doctoral degree in philology from Harvard University for his dissertation "Cicero’s Concept of Historiography". He returned to Trinity College as a teaching fellow and eventually served as classics instructor before leaving for Hobart and William Smith Colleges in 1953. Feldman began teaching at Yeshiva University as an assistant professor in 1956, before becoming an associate professor in 1961 and, in 1966, a professor of classics. In 1993, he was appointed Abraham Wouk Family Professor of Classics and Literature at Yeshiva University.
A fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research, he has received numerous other fellowships and awards.

Rasikapriya

Rasikapriya is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is the last (72nd) "melakarta" rāgam in the 72 "melakarta" rāgam system of Carnatic music. It is called Rasamanjari in Muthuswami Dikshitar school of Carnatic music.
Structure and Lakshana.
It is the 6th rāgam in the 12th "chakra Aditya". The mnemonic name is "Aditya-Sha". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ru gu mi pa dhu nu". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
As it is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "prati madhyamam" equivalent of last "suddha madhyamam" "melakarta", "Chalanata", which is the 36th "melakarta" scale.
"Janya" rāgams.
"Rasikapriya" has a few minor "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See List of "janya" rāgams for full list of scales associated with "Rasikapriya".
Compositions.
Here are some compositions sung in concerts, set to "Rasikapriya".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Rasikapriya's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields 2 other major "melakarta" rāgams, namely, "Mayamalavagowla" (rāgam using which first lessons are taught to beginners) and "Simhendramadhyamam". "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam. For further details and an illustration refer "Graha bhedam on Mayamalavagowla".

David Belbin

David Belbin (born 1958) is an English novelist.
He was born
in Sheffield, Yorkshire and has lived in Nottingham since attending the University of Nottingham where he earned a degree in English Literature and American Studies. After university, he taught English and Media Studies in Nottingham before becoming a full-time writer in 1994. Since 2002, he has worked part-time at Nottingham Trent University, where he teaches Creative Writing.
Belbin began his career by writing Young Adult Fiction, where his work is known for breaking boundaries and dealing responsibly with difficult social issues that affect teenagers. He first attained success with a number of books for Scholastic's Point Crime series. One of these, "Avenging Angel", led to his own popular series, The Beat, which followed a group of young police officers through their two-year probationary period, culminating in the adult novel length "Fallen Angel" in 2000. The series dealt with racism, rape, paedophilia and homosexuality as well as conventional crimes, often of the kind committed by teenagers.
Belbin's best-known Young Adult novel is "Love Lessons", which was published in 1998. "It is a full-length novel which examines the machinations and morality of a sexual affair between a male English teacher and a fifteen-year-old female student," Belbin has said. "I wrote the first draft as an adult novel. The young-adult version took me nearly ten years and a brave editor to get right, but it turned out to be a better book for it." "Denial", published in 2004, deals with a similar theme—a teacher accused of molesting a student—in the first person, and many readers found it even more shocking. His most popular novels this century are "Festival" (2002) about the Glastonbury Pop Festival, and "The Last Virgin" (2003) which is a wide ranging book about teenage sexuality: 'The author always chooses to understand rather than condemn. He has written numerous novels about young adults but this is his most outspoken.' 
Since the publication of "Nicked!" in 1999, Belbin has written a string of short novels for 'reluctant' readers, often dealing with the same kind of edgy themes as his full length work. "Stray" (2006) is about a girl gang and drug dealing, while "Shouting At The Stars" (2005) about the nervous breakdown of a disabled teenage singer/songwriter is one of many books that reflect Belbin's interest in popular music.
Belbin's fiction for adults reflects many of the same concerns as his work for teenagers, but without the limits dictated by Young Adult Fiction's place in Children's Literature. Witchcraft (Ambit magazine, 1989) is about ritual sexual abuse of children. Different Ways Of Getting Drunk looks at a young woman's experiments with drugs and bisexuality. Vasectomy (Horizon magazine, 2008) shows a philandering Labour MP in the run up to the Iraq war. His first 'adult' novel, The Pretender (Five Leaves) was about literary forgery. He has also written an early guide to eBay and edits the Crime Express series of novellas which features work by both major and emerging crime writers. 
Belbin's work has been translated into more than twenty-five languages. With cartoonist John Clark (aka Brick) he has produced several comics on social issues for UNICEF including Cry Me A River, about globalisation. In 2004, Belbin organised Turning Point, the UK's first national conference on Young Adult Fiction which featured many significant Young Adult Fiction authors, including Kevin Brooks, Melvyn Burgess, Anne Cassidy, Keith Gray, Graham Marks, Nicola Morgan, Beverley Naidoo and Bali Rai. In 2012, he became a trustee of Nottingham Playhouse. 
In 2011, Belbin began publishing a series of Nottingham based novels about crime and politics, "Bone And Cane" (Tindal Street Press), which follows a New Labour MP, Sarah Bone, and her ex-lover, convicted cannabis producer, Nick Cane, from 1997 onwards.

The Czilim class ACV (Project 20910) is a small patrol hovercraft operated by the Border Guard Service of Russia.
Configuration.
The Czilim class is the first new class of military hovercraft developed for the Russian military since the fall of the Soviet Union. It is based on an Almaz design and was ordered from Jaroslawski Sudostroiteinyj Zawod in the late 1990s. It is roughly the same size as the British SR.N6 hovercraft. 
The Czilim class was designed for border patrol duties on the Amur River on the border with China, and is expected to be used entirely by Russian Border Guards. It is intended as a smaller replacement for the Soviet Gus class LCAC. The first craft was laid down on 24 February 1998 and entered service in early 2001. Three further craft were built at Yaroslavl between 1997 and 1999. Four were in service in 2004, though none are believed to be currently operational.
The Czilim class is capable of carrying six Border Guards and their equipment.

Virtual rehabilitation

Virtual rehabilitation is a concept in psychology in which a therapeutic patient's training is based entirely on, or is augmented by, virtual reality simulation exercises. If there is no conventional therapy provided, the rehabilitation is said to be "virtual reality-based." Otherwise, if virtual rehabilitation is in addition to conventional therapy, the intervention is "virtual reality-augmented." Today, a majority of the population uses the virtual environment to navigate their daily lives. Almost one fourth of the world population uses the internet. In fact, virtual therapy has been used to treat a number of disorders.
The term Virtual Rehabilitation was coined in 2002 by Professor Daniel Thalmann of EPFL (Switzerland) and Professor Grigore Burdea of Rutgers University (USA). In their view the term applies to both physical therapy and cognitive interventions (such as for patients suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, phobias, anxieties, attention deficits or amnesia). Since 2008, the virtual rehabilitation "community" has been supported by the International Society on Virtual Rehabilitation 
Virtual rehabilitation offers a number of advantages compared to conventional therapeutic methods:

William "Bill" Bainbridge (born 9 March 1922) is an English ex-footballer who played as a forward for several clubs in the Football League, including Manchester United, Bury and Tranmere Rovers.
Born in Gateshead, County Durham, Bainbridge began his career with Ashington, but his career was immediately interrupted by the Second World War. During the war, Bainbridge played for Hartlepools United. His exploits there led to him signing for Manchester United when peace was declared, but, although he scored on his debut, he only made one appearance for the club and signed for Bury in May 1946, losing his place in the United team to Johnny Carey. He spent just over two seasons with Bury and moved to Tranmere Rovers in November 1948 after just two appearances for the Shakers.
It was at Tranmere that Bainbridge made the biggest impact. In six seasons with the Wirral side, Bainbridge played in almost 170 league matches, scoring 63 goals in the process.

Flowing Rivers

Flowing Rivers is the first album by English singer Andy Gibb. It was released in 1977. Although the album is not currently in print, it was released to iTunes along with the other two Andy Gibb albums in 2011.
The first Andy Gibb album was finally issued almost a year after it was recorded, carefully spaced between the Bee Gees releases. Andy wrote eight of the ten songs and Barry contributed to two. Andy was very suddenly very big in America, where both of the singles hit number 1. Unfortunately the ill effects of what Barry calls "first fame" had already claimed him by now.
Andy recorded an album of songs at Criteria around October 1976. He came to Miami in September and the sessions at Criteria are known to have coincided with the Eagles recording "Hotel California", which they completed in October. Eagles member Joe Walsh plays on two tracks and Andy said that listening to some of the Eagles' songs influenced the sound he wanted on his album. The sessions were produced by Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson, and with Barry on two songs, Albhy chose the experienced musicians who play on the album. The core group was Joey Murcia and Tim Renwick on guitar, Paul Harris and Albhy himself on piano and keyboards and Harold Cowart and Ron Ziegler on bass and drums. For some songs, they were joined by other top session players. Barry was very impressed with the polished sound of the session players. Barry was present to record only two songs ("I Just Want to Be Your Everything" and "(Love Is) Thicker Than Water") the two that he wrote for Andy, and although Andy said it was almost entirely Barry's work, it does sound a little closer to Andy's style.

John R. Reilly

John Richard Reilly (June 4, 1928 – October 12, 2008) was an adviser to a number of Democratic Party presidents and presidential candidates.
Reilly was born in Dubuque, Iowa, on June 4, 1928, as the only child of William and Stella Reilly. He received an undergraduate degree from the University of Iowa in 1952 and was granted a law degree in 1955. After his graduation from law school, Reilly was hired as an attorney working in the antitrust division of the United States Department of Justice. He joined John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign and was hired as an aide by Attorney General of the United States Robert F. Kennedy.
Reilly was given the assignment by the Kennedy administration to attend the speech delivered by Martin Luther King, Jr. on August 28, 1963, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial as part of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Roger Mudd reported that Reilly told him that he was positioned on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with a switch that would be used to cut off Dr. King's "I Have a Dream" speech "if the rhetoric got too inflammatory". A turntable with a 78-rpm recording of Mahalia Jackson's "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" was on standby, having been selected in advance by Reilly.
As a member of the Federal Trade Commission in June 1964, Reilly was one of three commissioners who voted in the majority to require that cigarette manufacturers "clearly and prominently" place a warning on packages of cigarettes effective January 1, 1965, stating that smoking is dangerous to health, in line with the warning issued by a special committee formed by the Surgeon General of the United States Luther Leonidas Terry. The same warning would be required in all cigarette advertising effective July 1, 1965.
After leaving the FTC in 1967, Reilly became a partner with the Washington, D.C., law firm of Pierson, Ball & Dowd, and was founding partner in 1972 of Winston & Strawn LLP, a firm based in Chicago.
Reilly served as a campaign aide to the presidential campaigns of all three of the Kennedys; for John in 1960, Robert in 1968 and Edward in 1980. He was also a campaign aide to Edmund S. Muskie in 1972, Walter Mondale in 1984 and Joseph Biden in 1988.
Reilly was in charge of the Vice Presidential search process on behalf of Walter Mondale in the 1984 Presidential election that led to the selection of Geraldine Ferraro as Mondale's running mate.
His wife was Margaret Warner, a senior correspondent for "The "PBS" NewsHour". The two were married in 1986 at a ceremony held in Ogunquit, Maine.
He died of abdominal cancer on October 12, 2008, in Washington, at the age of 80.

D&amp;RGW K-28

Denver & Rio Grande Western K-28 is a class of ten narrow gauge 2-8-2, Mikado type, steam railway locomotives, built as freight locomotives in 1923 by the Schenectady Locomotive Works of the American Locomotive Company for the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. They were the first new narrow gauge locomotives ordered by the railroad since 1903. They initially comprised class 190, but were reclassed K-28 in 1924 when the railroad reorganized into the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad.
The chassis is of outside-frame design with the drive wheels placed between the main frames, and the running gear (cranks, counterweights, rods and valve gear) to the outside. This general arrangement was also used on the earlier class K-27 and later class K-36 and K-37 engines.
In later years they were tasked with carrying express passengers on the narrow gauge such as the San Juan from Alamosa to Durango, The Silverton from Durango to Silverton, the Shavano from Salida to Gunnison, and on the Chili Line.
White Pass & Yukon.
During World War II, seven of them were purchased by the US Army for use on the White Pass and Yukon Route in Alaska and the Yukon. The locomotives which went there were renumbered USA 250–256, but they did not fare well in the bitter Yukon winters. In particular, the driving wheel counterweights had the unfortunate tendency to ride up on trackside ice, lifting the engine off the rails. All seven were withdrawn from service in 1944, and were barged to Seattle in 1946 for scrapping.
The K-28s today.
The three locos which remained with the D&RGW, numbers 473, 476 and 478 were assigned to the Durango – Silverton tourist trains from the 1950s onwards. The Durango & Silverton inherited these when it took over the Silverton Branch in 1981. Number 473 is operational while 476 is in the Museum at Durango awaiting major repairs, with 478 currently being rebuilt.
Due to their smaller size, these engines are often used on the Durango & Silverton for shorter trains, usually the first or last on the schedule, and often for helper service or sectioned trains. Despite being smaller than the K-36 class locomotives, a little older and less powerful, the engine crews tend to favor a trip on these engines because the design ALCO used was superior in balance and servicing. Firing can be tricky when the engine is working hard, as the clamshell-style firedoors tend to pull into the backhead of the boiler due to the draft, and if any flues in the boiler are leaking, the loss of draft on the fire is much harder to work around than on the K-36 locomotives. Firing while the engine is working hard is done with a large "heel" pattern, generally with as little coal on the flue sheet as possible, and gradually sloping the fire bed towards the door sheet to the height or higher than the firedoors. This results in the draft being forced through the fire bed in the thinner areas towards the flue sheet, which usually is hindered by the lack of draft between the grates and the arch brick. New firemen sometimes have a hard time learning this because there are fewer training hours available on the K-28 class locomotives compared to the railroad's usual K-36 workhorses which have a larger firebox and are more forgiving of poor technique.

Magaly Medina

Magaly Jesús Medina Vela (born March 31, 1963) is a controversial and criticized Peruvian Hostess who claims to be journalist of the TV show "Magaly TeVe" that airs on ATV. She questions and judges the lifestyle of Peruvian celebrities, whose world she calls Chollywood, the union of the words: "cholo" and "Hollywood". Through her TV program she gossips the lives of famous people, airing reports of their day-to-day news.
History.
Her launch into the media came in April 1991 on the journalistic debate show ""Fuego Cruzado"" ("Crossed Fire") in which, along with other journalists and linguist Martha Hildebrandt, member of the Peruvian Academy of Language, harshly questioned and criticized well-known and now deceased television presenter Augusto Ferrando, whom they described as vulgar for his style on his former TV show, "Trampolín a la Fama" ("Trampoline to Fame").
Her emergence on Peruvian television was on ""El Noticiero"" ("The News") on ATV. It consisted of a sequence of performances called "Regardless of the Consequences". El Noticiero later became its own TV show. The show was renamed Magaly TeVe, and aired its first episode on November 1, 1997. The show was first broadcast by Frecuencia Latina, a Peruvian network, and then ATV.
Ampays.
This is a controversial word of Quechua origin, used to determine situations in which someone is found doing something hidden against their will. The success of the space of Mrs. Medina is due to the famous "ampays" (recorded with a camera hidden characters from the television and sport in compromising situations), which had won her a program whose line is between first places, seeking thereby generating shameful and outrageous situations.
Nickname.
Magaly Medina claims getting the truth out to the people and catching famous celebrities doing shameful things, which most of them deny doing even with proof (video footage). Her show is called "Magaly TV" because it sounds like "Magaly te ve" ("Magaly sees you") in reference to the constant stalking of famous Peruvian people.

Davega Stores

Davega Stores was a consumer durables, appliance, sporting goods, and apparel chain which operated 27 stores in the metropolitan New York City area in 1954. 
The business was founded by I. Davega in 1879 at Third Avenue and 34th Street. H. M. Stein was the company's president in the mid-1950s. Its vice-president was Abram Davega, son of I. Davega. The firm was a division of the Atlas Stores Corporation.
Among the products sold by the retailer were televisions, radios, and baseball board games. The Kolster Radio Corporation signed an agreement with Davega Stores in late 1928, representing a significant addition to the retail outlets of the radio merchandise dealer.
Business history.
Davega Stores' 14th location opened at 166-170 Jamaica Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, in November 1928. Their 27th store opened at 924 Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, in April 1932.
In June 1953 the business announced a sharp increase in profit over the previous year which ended on March 31, 1952. Net income came to $118, 998, amounting to .24 per common share. The firm's inventory increased by $143,000 over the previous year, with an inventory totaling $4,389,000. On December 16, 1953 Davega Stores' directors took no action on a common dividend, which had been 0.15, paid semiannually to shareholders. A regular quarterly dividend of .25 on 5 per cent preferred stock was declared, payable on January 2, 1954. In May 1954 the firm was generating $25,000,000 in annual revenue.
In April 1954, Davega Stores employed large newspaper space and window displays in marketing Line Drive, a baseball game manufactured by
Lord & Freber of Los Angeles, California. The product tested players team-managing ability and playing style. 
The corporation opened a new store at 152 West 42nd Street, in the Times Square area, on November 6, 1954. On opening day the store offered bargains like a $20 table radio for
.98 and reconditioned television receivers for $7.95. It remained open all night the first day of business and until twelve midnight the following day.
Bankruptcy.
A federal court ordered Davega Stores into straight bankruptcy in April 1963, when its court-appointed trustee could not formulate a reorganization plan under which the chain could pay its debts. Eight of its stores were acquired by Henry Modell & Co., which submitted a winning bid of $311,000 in an April 1963 auction. Henry Modell was the president of the newly formed Modell's Davega, Inc., which combined eight Davega Stores with its four discount locations. The headquarters of the new business was moved to Davega's store in the Commodore Hotel.

Album information.
This album was not as well received as Guldbrandsen's debut album, but it still managed to reach the Top 40 albums list in 2004.
Reviews.
The review of the album on the Musical Discoveries website states "The first thing listeners will notice of the album, especially when comparing it to Surfing In The Air is the more classy recording style. Perhaps to appeal to a broader audience, rock and pop references are not overwhelming, but that's not to say that songs are without guitar or other instrumental solos... Moments is a superb follow-up album!"

Shadow Dancing (album)

Shadow Dancing is the second album by English singer and teen idol Andy Gibb, released in 1978. Continuing the momentum of his first successes, notably "I Just Want to Be Your Everything", he began work with the Gibb-Galuten-Richardson production team on his second album. Although the album is not currently in print, it was released to iTunes along with the other two Andy Gibb albums in 2011.
The title track, written by Gibb and all three of his brothers, was released as a single in the US in April 1978 (alongside the album), and in mid-June began a seven-week run at #1, achieving platinum status. Two further top ten singles, "An Everlasting Love" (#5) and "(Our Love) Don't Throw it All Away" (#9), a song also released by his brothers in 1979, were extracted from the album, which became a million seller.
Andy's second album was made under the direction of Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson, mostly while Barry, Robin and Maurice were off filming "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" up to January. Barry again was executive producer and was present during recording of a few of the songs. John Sambataro, who sang backing and harmony vocals on the non-Barry songs, plays slide guitar. Later in 1978 he left the Andy Gibb band and went on tour with Dave Mason (ex-Traffic), and early in 1979 he became lead guitarist for McGuinn, Clark and Hillman, a band playing country rock along the lines of some Andy's songs. Also on this album was Jock Bartley of the country rock band Firefall, then recording their third album at Criteria. They had their Bee Gees connections: the first two albums had been engineered by Karl Richardson, Joe Lala was a regular guest musician, and John Sambataro eventually joined Firefall in 1982 and recorded two albums with them.
Amy Hanson at Allmusic described "Fool for a Night" as a 'bittersweet, up tempo piece of pop'. "Melody" as a 'wistful love song', "I Go for You" as a 'smarmy as it may be in hindsight, was still better than many of its contemporaries'.

Dark current (physics)

In physics and in electronic engineering, dark current is the relatively small electric current that flows through photosensitive devices such as a photomultiplier tube, photodiode, or charge-coupled device even when no photons are entering the device. It is referred to as reverse bias leakage current in non-optical devices and is present in all diodes. Physically, dark current is due to the random generation of electrons and holes within the depletion region of the device that are then swept by the high electric field.
The charge generation rate is related to specific crystallographic defects within the depletion region. Dark-current spectroscopy can be used to determine the defects present by monitoring the peaks in the dark current histogram's evolution with temperature.
Dark current is one of the main sources for noise in image sensors such as charge-coupled devices. The pattern of different dark currents can result in a fixed-pattern noise; dark frame subtraction can remove an estimate of the mean fixed pattern, but there still remains a temporal noise, because the dark current itself has a shot noise.

Bulk-handling crane

A bulk-handling crane is one that, instead of a simple hook that can handle a range of slung loads, has an integral grab for lifting bulk cargoes such as coal, mineral ore etc. 
Where the grab is a two-piece hinged bucket, it is known as a shell grab or shell bucket. Working the grab requires extra cables from the crane jib, so requires a specialised design of crane throughout, not merely an attachment. Some grabs use 2 cables for lift and control, others use 4.
In 1927, Stothert & Pitt of Bath, Somerset produced the first specialised bulk-handling crane. This was to unload coal at Barking power station in London. 
Orange-peel grabs.
Where a cargo is coarser in size than minerals, commonly for scrap metal, then an orange-peel grab may be used instead of a shell. These have six or eight segments of "peel" independently hinged around a central core. They are better able to grab at an uneven load, rather than just scooping at small pieces. If the load is made of long thin pieces, a grab may also be able to carry far more than a single "grabful" at one time.
Although orange-peel grabs may be hung from cables on a jib, they're also commonly mounted directly onto a jib. This is more suitable for grabbing at awkward loads that might otherwise tend to tip a hanging grab over. They may also use hydraulics to control the segments rather than weight and hoist cables.
Kangaroo cranes.
Another of Stothert & Pitt's innovations was the kangaroo crane. Rather than slewing (rotating) the crane to reach the delivery hopper on-shore, a kangaroo crane has its own in-built hopper beneath the jib, that slews with it as the crane rotates. Dumping the grab contents into the hopper now only requires the quicker luffing movement, without needing to slew for each load.
The term "kangaroo crane" has also been applied more recently to jumping cranes, tower cranes used in the construction of skyscrapers that are capable of raising their towers as construction grows upwards.

<doc id="19805938" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19805938" title="Sacramento Valley and Eastern Railway">
Sacramento Valley and Eastern Railway

The Sacramento Valley and Eastern Railway (SV&E) was a railway company that operated in Shasta County, California from 1908 to the early 1930s.
History.
From 1908 to the early 1930s, the town of Pitt (now under Shasta Lake) was the terminus for the standard gauge Sacramento Valley and Eastern Railway, which extended on the Southern Pacific up the Pitt River northeast to the town of Delmar. Although claimed to be a common carrier, the SV&E was solely dependent on the success of the mine and smelter at Bully Hill, about above the railroads easternmost terminus. The decline in copper prices and lack of revenue led to the close of the railroad
DeLamar Railroad.
The Bully Hill and Squaw Creek areas of Shasta County had been worked for gold in the 1850s and 1860s and quartz in the 1880s, the more precious of the region's mineral sources. In July 1899, a colorful New York financier, Captain Joseph Raphael De Lamar, purchased the Bully Hill mines for about $200,000 and set about building a smelter if 400 ton capacity and developing the area for copper. A 30" gauge railroad (1.5 miles long) was used to connect level 3 of the mine with the smelter, was installed at the same time, utilizing a diminutive shay bought new for the project which became informally known as the DeLamar Railroad. The smelting plant began operation in 1901. 
In 1901 DeLamar built an electrolytic refinery in Chrome, New Jersey, the product of the Bully Hill smelter in the form of flat ingots of blister copper and was shipped to New Jersey for refining. This was the first operation in the Bully Hill area that met with any kind of success. However a major setback was the lack of good transportation. Freight was hauled in and out by wagons on crude dirt roads over Bear Mountain Summit, to the railhead of the Anderson and Bella Vista Railroad at Bella Vista.
Construction and opening.
Copper Prices were rising and the property looked attractive enough to the General Electric Company of New York, who purchased it in 1905 and continued to operate the smelter at capacity. To alleviate the transportation problem, General Electric commenced grading in 1907 on the Sacramento Valley and Eastern Railway. Sometime in 1908, the mile railroad was open to the public and to recover some of the initial investment in its construction, full freight and passenger service was offered. A new 2-6-2T tank engine was ordered from Baldwin Locomotive Works in Pennsylvania that same year, although a leased SP 4-4-0 was used to open the line.
Operation.
The railroad was started quite late in the "copper boom" and the railway's fortunes turned after two years. The open roasting of the ores prior to smelting, necessary because of the high sulfur content, released clouds of smoke and toxic fumes, which had disastrous effects on any plant life that came in contact with it. In July 1910, following the filing of a suit by the U.S. government regarding damage being done to the nearby national forests, the Bully Hill smelter was closed down, never to revived by General Electric. The cost if installing mechanical roasters was to costly in light of the now declining copper prices.
Meanwhile, the SV&E continued providing a service with a "skunk" gasoline motor car being used in later years to carry passengers, mail and express from Pitt out on the line. While the smelter business was shaky, there was at least a less-than-carload business of sorts with milk, farm equipment, papers, and hay being handled by the line.
In 1917, Walter Arnstein, president of the Oakland and Antioch Railroad, and owner of the Nevada County Narrow Gauge, secured a long-term lease and the mining of copper and zinc resumed. DeLamar's original 30" gauge railroad was utilized to transfer the ore to DeLamar where it was loaded onto standard gauge cars and shipped via the Sacramento Valley and Eastern and the Southern Pacific to the Mammoth Smelter at Kennet (now under Shasta Lake). Smelting operations were revived at Bully Hill in early 1920, only to be stopped again following declining prices in 1922.
In 1920, Shasta Zinc and Copper Company acquired the mine and smelter area and in 1924, consolidated several mines in the area, including the Afterthought at Ingot, from which an ariel tramway was constructed in 1925, connecting it with the smelter at Bully Hill, about away. A material known as Shasta zinc oxide was produced, which was an ingredient in paint and rubber tires among other things. The final product was shipped out via SV&E and SP to San Francisco where it was placed on a steam ship to be sent to Baltimore.
Decline and abandonment.
Following steady declines in copper and zinc prices in 1927, the Bully Hill operation was shut down once again and the SV&E became idle. The Sacramento Valley & Eastern was not listed in the 1930 "Official Guide of the Railways" and was abandoned entirely following the collapse of the bridge across the Sacramento River just east of Pitt during the floods of early 1939. 
Today no trace of the right of way remains since having been submerged under the waters of Shasta Lake in the early 1940s.

Dark current (chemistry)

In analytical chemistry, dark current refers to the constant response produced by a spectrochemical receptor, even in the absence of radiation. This response adds to the signal produced when the receptor is used to measure light and so must be dealt with to determine how much of the detector response is actually due to the radiation. To compensate for this extra signal, the dark current may be measured in the absence of radiation and then subtracted from the final signal or reduced to zero by a compensating circuit. Dealing with dark current is a form of blank correction.

It is the 4th rāgam in the 9th "chakra Brahma". The mnemonic name is "Brahma-Bhu". The mnemonic phrase is "sa ra gu mi pa dhi ni". Its "" structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see "swaras" in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
As it is a "melakarta" rāgam, by definition it is a "sampoorna" rāgam (has all seven notes in ascending and descending scale). It is the "prati madhyamam" equivalent of "Chakravakam", which is the 16th "melakarta" scale.
"Janya" rāgams.
"Ramapriya" has a few minor "janya" rāgams (derived scales) associated with it. See List of "janya" rāgams for full list of rāgams associated with "Ramapriya" scale.
Compositions.
Here are some compositions sung in concerts, set to "Ramapriya".
Related rāgams.
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this rāgam.
"Ramapriya's" notes when shifted using "Graha bhedam", yields no other "melakarta" rāgam, as such a step taken on any of the 6 "swarams" (Ri to Ni) comes up with scales that do not conform to the "melakarta" rules. "Graha bhedam" is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the "shadjam" to the next note in the rāgam.

SS David H. Atwater

The SS "David H. Atwater" was a small unarmed coastal steamer which was sunk on 2 April 1942 by gunfire from German submarine "U-552" in one of the more controversial actions of the Kriegsmarine during World War II, primarily due to the manner of the sinking.
History.
The ship began life as the "Crabtree", constructed by the Great Lakes Engineering Works of Ecorse, Michigan for the United States Shipping Board, and launched in June 1919. She was renamed "W.J. Crosby" in 1922, for the North Shore Transit Company of Port Huron, Michigan, and in 1929 was sold to the Canada Forwarding Company Ltd. of Port Arthur, Ontario. In 1935 she was renamed "David H. Atwater" for the Atwacoal Transportation Company of Fall River, Massachusetts, which became her home port.
Sinking.
On the night of 2 April 1942, at the height of the U-boat offensive against US shipping known as the Second Happy Time, the "David H. Atwater" was en route from Norfolk, Virginia to Fall River, Massachusetts, with a full load of 4,000 tons of coal. Her master, William K. Webster, had disregarded instructions and sailed from the Chesapeake in the afternoon, therefore could not make the run to the Delaware Capes before nightfall.
Around 21:00, between Cape Charles and Cape Henlopen, the ship was ambushed by U-552 , commanded by Erich Topp, which had followed her underwater. "U-552" surfaced about from the freighter and opened fire with her 88mm deck gun and automatic weapons (possibly including the submarine's 20mm cannon) without warning, one of her first shells destroying the bridge and killing all of the officers. In all, 93 shots were fired from the deck gun, with 50 hits being recorded on the small freighter, which rapidly began to sink.
As the "Atwater" sank, Erich Topp directed his crewmen to continue firing, striking the "Atwater"s crewmen as they tried to man the lifeboats. When Captain Webster was shot, the crew abandoned attempts to launch the lifeboats and leapt into the sea.
Aftermath.
The first ship to arrive on the scene was the small Coast Guard Patrol Boat USS "CG-218", which found a lifeboat holding three survivors and three bodies; the survivors reported that they had dived overboard and swam to the boat. Next on the scene was Coast Guard cutter USCGC "Legare" (WPC-144), which had heard the gunfire and arrived just fifteen minutes later. The "Legare" found a second lifeboat with a body aboard; the boat was discovered to have been riddled by gunfire, and lent strength to the widespread belief at the time that U-boats were deliberately murdering the survivors of ships they had sunk. The "Legare" landed the three survivors and four bodies at Chincoteague Island Coastguard Station, then returned to sea to carry out further searching. The destroyers USS "Noa" and USS "Herbert" were directed to the scene at 21:22 and arrived at 24:00, but the "U-552" had by then escaped the scene, going on to sink other vessels.
Bodies, and lifeboats and liferafts from the "Atwater" recovered by the Coast Guard were landed at Ocean City, Maryland. It was commonly believed at the time that "U-552" had deliberately machine-gunned the "Atwater"s crewmen in the boats and rafts.
Liberty Ship "William Cox".
The Liberty Ship "William Cox" (2485), launched on 4 December 1944, was named for one of the "David H. Atwater"s firemen.

Arnhem is a railway station located in Arnhem, the Netherlands. The station was opened on 14 May 1845 and is located on the Rhijnspoorweg (Amsterdam - Emmerich), the Arnhem–Leeuwarden railway and the Arnhem–Nijmegen railway. The station opened at the same time as the Rhijnspoorweg. 
The station is the main station of Arnhem, and at present, has around 40,000 passengers that use the station per day, this makes it the 9th busiest station in the Netherlands.
Reconstruction.
In 2006 a reconstruction of the complete station area was started. In October of that year, a temporary station entrance opened, that could only be reached by three sets of stairs (or by elevators). On July 2, 2011, the new tunnel under the platforms opened and the temporary entrance was closed and dismantled. A new platform north of the three existing platforms and a footbridge connecting the platforms opened in the summer of 2011.
In the Summer of 2011 a new dive under was opened west of the station which allows trains to Nijmegen and Utrecht to cross all the lines without having to wait for each other. This resulted in a complete suspension of all train traffic to the west of the station during five weeks in the Summer of 2011. The dive under opened at 29 August 2011.
At the end of the reconstruction project the station will be renamed to Arnhem Centraal.

1946 African Mine Workers' Union strike

The African Mine Workers' Strike, by mine workers of Witwatersrand started on August 12, 1946 and lasted around 1 week. The strike was attacked by police and over the week, at least 1,248 workers were wounded and at least 9 killed.
African Mine Workers' Union.
In 1941 a miners' conference was called by the Transvaal Provincial Committee of the African National Congress. The conference was supported by Paramount Chief of Zululand and trade unions.
It was here that the African Mine Workers' Union came into being and elected a committee under the presidency of J. B. Marks, who also became President of the Transvaal African National Congress.
At first the union was not recognised by the Chamber of Mines, but after sustained pressure for better wages and conditions, the prime minister, Field Marshal Jan Smuts, announced some piecemeal increases improvements in conditions while at the same time issuing War Measure No. 1425—banning gatherings of more than twenty people on mining property without permission.
Despite union officials being arrested in 1944 at a meeting in Witwatersrand and in Springs, a conference was held in May 1946 which decided to approach the government with demands for a ten shillings a day wage and other improvements—or to take strike action.
On August 12, 1946, more than 60,000 worker's in Witwatersrand refused to continue working for the existing wages. Within a week police were deployed and incorporated brutal tactics in an effort to break the strike. Officially 9 died and more than 1,248 workers were injured, and many regarded the strike as a failure. Although the initial demands were ignored and the workers returned to the mines after only a week, the strike was viewed as a crucial moment in South Africa's development. Ultimately this initial protest later influenced political realignments, and has been associated with increased labour conscience and social change. By addressing the conditions necessary to maintain cheap migrant labor, this movement provided insight into the manner in which Apartheid serves as a vehicle for perpetuating pre-capitalist modes of production. Methods such as the ' compound system,' which essentially restrained workers from having any contact with Union organizers, were direct results of the initial failed Union Strike of 1946.
In August 1946 an open air conference was held in Newtown Market Square as no hall where Africans could hold meetings was big enough to accommodate those present and the decision to strike was taken.
Bloody Tuesday.
The police attacked the workers with batons, bayonets, and gunfire outside the mines and in the mines when forced to work.
Police brutality reached a bloody climax on a peaceful march from the East Rand to Johannesburg on Tuesday, 13 August. Police opened fire on the procession and a number of workers were killed.
This led to the Transvaal Council of Non-European Trade Unions (CONETU) calling a general strike in Johannesburg on Wednesday, 14 August. CONETU called a meeting at Newtown Market Square the next day which was banned by the Riotous Assemblies Act. This meeting was also attacked by police with guns and bayonets.
During the week workers and leaders of the ANC, the Communist Party, the Indian and Coloured Congresses and the trade unions were arrested, tried, imprisoned, and deported.
The 1946 African miners strike signified a shift in public conscience, and was widely considered the beginning of what would later become the anti-apartheid movement. This strike, " was led by the African Mine Workers Union, whose president, J.B. Marks, was also a leader in the South African Communist Party." (Workers World newspaper, Aug. 29, 1996. Monica Moorehead). Most workers averaged two shillings per shift, and were responsible for contributing a portion of their wages towards work clothes and bedding. Many were removed from their families, sometimes for years, while their children and spouses starved. The AMWU initially placed demands to create a legal minimum wage, cost-of-living allowance, and regular wage increases. The miners settled on a 10 shilling per day minimum wage, and improved working conditions as the basis of their demands. The Transvaal Chamber of Mines functioned as a closely knit cartel comprising five separate mining groups that essentially controlled the largest labor force in South Africa. Their influence over state revenue, and political seats in the government allowed them to function with relative impunity. With a general monopoly over South Africa's agricultural and industrial products, the Transvaal Chamber of Mines was in effect capable of controlling workers wages and suppressing efforts to unionize. This was largely achieved by keeping workers in policed compounds and brutally restricting their ability to communicate or be contacted by union organizers.
In the wake of discontent following settlements that maintained the existing labour cost, Prime Minister Smuts issued War Measure NO. 1425 this measure which, " prohibiting gatherings of more than twenty persons on mining property without special permission," effectively ceased further organized trade union meetings. (African National Congress, Sept. 12,1976, Monty Naicker). Following the suppression of the 1946 strike, union groups like The Communist Party of South Africa experienced brutal treatment at the hands of the existing government. Many of the parties leaders were indicted on charges of sedition and treason. "This was followed by a systematic series of measures to destroy the CPSA, culminating in the suppression of Communism Act in 1950." (Communist University, COSATU, 1946 mineworkers strike, press release, Aug. 11, 2006). However, despite continual efforts through the media to define the strike as a failure this initial protest has had a lasting impact on South African politics. The formation and emergence of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) represents a direct lineage to these early union organizers. This organization, " arguably the heirs to the 1946 strike are currently engaged in a series of territorial disputes with the breakaway Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU)." (Global Research, Aug. 21, 2012. Chris Webb).
Cheap Labour has historically provided the back-bone for South Africa's thriving mining industry. Much of this work-force has routinely been composed of poor workers abducted from surrounding regions. " Research shows that by 1929, more than 115,000 Mozambicans had been forcibly recruited to work in South African mines." (The Southern Times, Felix Njini, Sept. 17, 2012). The increased foreign demand for platinum has only served to perpetuate this system of abuse and oppression. While the number of workers extracted from the surrounding areas has declined, local peasants are still routinely pressured into labour once they reach the working age. While many of the injustices imposed by South Africa's mining industry persist, the 1946 miners strike remains a prevalent reminder of the plight of African workers and their families.

Jinsha II-class LCAC

The Type 722 II class LCAC with NATO reporting name Jinsha II class LCAC () is a medium size air-cushioned landing craft (hovercraft) operated by the People's Liberation Army Navy of China. It is frequently but erroneously referred by many as Dagu class, its predecessor, due to misspelling and lack of information in the 1970s, when these projects first appeared. There are also other names for this class, mostly resulted in different spellings.
Type 716 LCAC.
The origin of Type 722 II class LCAC can be traced straight back in the late 1960s to Type 716 LCAC, from which Type 722 II class eventually developed from directly. In the late 1960s, People's Liberation Army General Logistics Department asked 708th Research Institute to design a prototype LCAC for logistic needs to supply coastal islands, but due to political turmoil in China, namely, Cultural Revolution, construction took three years after the design was approved, and it was not until 1978 when the boat was finally completed by Hudong (沪东造船厂) Shipyard in Shanghai and entered service in the same year. NATO reporting name Dagu A class was given to Type 716 LCAC, which achieved speed over 100 km per hour during trials in Dianshan Lake, before being sent to South China Sea for further evaluation. Specifications:
NATO reporting name Dagu A class was erroneously used to refer other Chinese LCACs, but analysis of the technical data revealed that this name is actually for Type 716 class (also Type 716 I class when the upgraded version appeared later), when more information became available from Chinese official sources years later.
Type 716 II LCAC.
Type 716 LCAC did not enter mass production after the prototype was built due to its fatal design flaw: the propulsion system was an aeroengine driven by gasoline, which is prone to fire. 708th Research Institute and Hudong Shipyard completed its upgrade in 1983, which replaced the original gasoline engine with a 12L413FC diesel engine. Other improvements included utilization of ducted propeller, and redesigned skirt and propulsion system. The improvement version is designed by Chinese as Type 716 II class LCAC', with NATO reporting name as Dagu B class, and experienced gained from this class was directly used on later Type 722 II class LCAC.
Type 722 LCAC.
In 1975, after the design of Type 716 LCAC was approved, Chinese navy asked 708th Research Institute to design a medium sized LCAC utilizing experienced gained from Type 716. Just as in the case of Type 716, Tye 722 LCAC suffered delay in construction after design was approved due to the same political turmoil in China, and it was not in 1979 when the first unit entered the service. The prototype was built with aluminum alloy with both the bow and stern door/ramp, and was able to carry up to 15 tons of cargo or a company of soldiers. With displacement of 65 tons, the craft can reach speed of 90 km / hour with the help of four 1100 kW aero-engines. Type 722 received NATO reporting name Jingsha I class LCAC. The sole prototype (452) lacked a bow door for disembarkation, and this feature may have been added to an improved version before entering production. The prototype is believed have been scrapped. Ten are believed to be in service.
However, deployment experienced revealed that the performance of Type 722 was not satisfactory. The primary design flaw was the same one shared by its direct predecessor, Type 716 LCAC, in that the four engines are gasoline drive, prone to fire. In addition, the engine was very noise and had a high MTBF rate, and the aluminum alloy was not resistant to salt corrosion. This shortcoming lead to a massive improvement program that lasted a decade, resulting in Type 722 II LCAC.
Type 722 II LCAC.
To solve the problems of Type 722 LCAC exposed during deployment, designers looked back to its predecessor Type 716 I/II class LCAC for answers, but due to the difference between the two classes, new technologies were needed, including new type of magnesium - aluminum alloy used to replace the original aluminum alloy. The improvement effort required more resources, and 702nd Research Institute and Chinese navy joined the team to assist 708th Research Institute.
The most significant improvement of Type 722 II LCAC over the original Type 722 is in its propulsion system. In 1983, an indigenous Type 409 gas-turbine engine based on WJ-6 (WJ = Wo-Jiang 涡浆)turboprop aero-engine was successfully developed by China, and it was decided to adopt it for Type 722 II LCAC. Because this was the very first time a gas-turbine engine was adopted for LCAC, many tests were needed, which protracted the time. It was not three years later in 1986 when all land-based test for Type 409 gas-turbine engine was completed, and then installed on the boat in the following year. Finally, in 1989, the first Type 722 II LCAC was completed and entered the service in the same year. Type 722 II LCAC received NATO reporting name Jinsha II class LCAC.
The displacement of Type 722 II LCAC is slightly increased to 70 tons in comparison to the 65 tons of the original Type 722 LCAC, but the cargo capacity is also increased by the same amount to 20 tons total, as opposed to the 15 tons of the original Type 722 LCAC. It is claimed that the Jinsha II LCAC is roughly the same size the U.S. Navy LCAC, and is designed for similar duties, but in reality, the Chinese equivalent of USN LCAC is actually slightly larger Type 726 LCAC with NATO reporting name Yuyi class. Type 722 II LCAC entered production in limited numbers.
Type 726 LCAC.
Type 726 LCAC with NATO reporting name Yuyi class is a natural development of Type 722 series LCAC. Type 726 LCAC is usually carried by Type 071 amphibious transport dock, and up to four can be housed in the Well deck of Type 071. Designed by Aviation Industry Corporation of China and constructed by Jiangnan Shipyard, the first unit was launched in December, 2009 and entered Chinese service soon after. Type 726 LCAC is frequently viewed as the Chinese equivalent of USN LCAC due to their similar size and missions, but Type 726 LCAC carries less cargo because domestic Chinese engine for its LCAC is bulkier and heavier than that of the USN LCAC, but nonetheless, up to 60 tons of cargo can be carried, enough for a Type 99 tank. In contrast, USN LCAC can carry more around 70 tons of cargo. Most Chinese internet websites have claimed that the tank Type 726 LCAC will carry would most likely be the lighter Type 96, which will probably be adopted by People's Liberation Army Marine Corps than the heavier and costlier Type 99, but such claims have yet to be verified by official / governmental / western sources.

Arequito Revolt

The Arequito Revolt () (Arequito, Santa Fe Province, Argentina, January 8, 1820), was a military revolt by officers of the Army of the North, through which they recused themselves from the fight in the civil war against the federals. Their intention was to return to the front of the war against the royalists in Upper Peru, an objective they could not ultimately meet. It signified the beginning of the disintegration of the Supreme Directorship and was one of the main causes of the centralist defeat at the Battle of Cepeda.
Federalism in the Río de la Plata.
The successive Argentine governments since the May Revolution tried to govern all the provinces that comprised the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata citing the argument that when the king's governance ceased, its rights reverted to the people. Starting with the dissolution of the Junta Grande, it was clear that the desire of the city of Buenos Aires was to dominate the country, with as little input from the other cities as possible.
The cities from the interior of the country, in the name of their respective territories, insistently requested to have equal participation in the national government and to elect their own local governments. For years, the different governments from Buenos Aires made an effort in the opposite direction: all the governors were appointed directly by the central government, and the city of Buenos Aires' representation was always greater than the rest in the assemblies that followed. On the other hand, several of the central governments fell by Coup d'état's organized in Buenos Aires exclusively, and the national government that followed each, was invariably named by the "porteño" cabildo.
The reaction of the interior provinces was surprisingly slow but inevitable. The first effective response to the porteño control came from the Banda Oriental (present-day Uruguay), where the caudillo José Artigas denied the capital the right to govern his province. In 1815, after more than a year of civil war, he gained complete control of the Provincia Oriental.
His example was followed by the bordering provinces, starting with Entre Ríos, where several caudillos deposed the governors placed by the Directory; with Francisco Ramírez as the leader in the province. A little later Corrientes Province followed and separated from obedience to the central government.
The dissent followed to Santa Fe Province, which revolted against porteño dominance in 1815 and again in 1816 under the command of Mariano Vera, later succeeded by Estanislao López. The central government vehemently denied them the right of separation, as its territory was the obligatory route of communication with the interior of the country. No less than five military expeditions were launched from Buenos Aires to crush Santa Fe's resistance, but none succeeded.
The Northern provinces followed suit, Salta established an autonomous government under general Güemes, the Province of Cuyo refused the replacement of their governor José de San Martín, and Córdoba elected their own governor José Javier Díaz, a follower of Artigas.

The Army of the North was formed to fight the War of Independence against the Spanish Empire in Upper Peru; but after the third defeat at the Sipe Sipe, was left weakened and with a single base at Tucumán. In theory, its mission was to wait until the conditions permitted to restart the reconquest of the provinces in Upper Peru.
The "Directorio" decided to use the army to suppress internal rebellions in 1816, a fraction of the army was used to reinstate the governor of La Rioja Province, and at the beginning of the following year, the governor of Santiago del Estero Province. A little later, another part of the army helped deposed the governor of Córdoba Province and support his successor.
In 1818, director Pueyrredón decided to suppress Santa Fe Province with a double attack: while an army attacked from the south, a division of the Army of the North advanced from the west. The initiative failed before the quick defense of Estanislao López, who capture the commander of the west column from Córdoba, Juan Bautista Bustos and then succeeded in repelling the attack from the south. Another similar attempt was thwarted in 1819.
The bulk of the Army of the North was establish in Córdoba, tio the annoyance of many of their members, as it was far from the royalist enemies. In April, a peace treaty signed between the governments of Buenos Aires and Santa Fe gave hopes of a solution to the internal quarrels, and the offices believed they would go back to the north front.
The treaty pacified its signatories, but nor Artigas (who considered himself López's superior) nor the Directorio were pleased. Artigas wanted the national government to unite against the Portuguese, who had invaded his province, from Brazil. The new Supreme Director, José Rondeau, wanted to defeat Santa Fe with help from the Portuguese. He called in the Army of the Andes, but its commander, San Martín refused to obey. He also ordered the commander of the Army of the North, Manuel Belgrano, who initiated a march towards the south.
By order of Artigas, Ramírez crossed the Paraná River and invaded the north of Buenos Aires Province, later retreating. Rondeau organized his army in the capital and marched to meet the threat. The Army of the North entered Santa Fe Province.
Revolt.
Arriving at Arequito, on January 8, 1820, general Bustos, supported by colonels Alejandro Heredia and José María Paz, directed the military rebellion. The arrested colones Cornelio Zelaya and Manuel Guillermo Pinto in the middle of the night and traveled to a short distance from Fernández de la Cruz encampment and decided to have discussions with him. They told him they refused to continue with the civil war and to go back to the north front against the royalists instead. They explicitly declared themselves neutral in the conflict between the federalists and the Directory, to avoid being accused of having supported the enemy. Bustos had at this time about 1,600 men, and Fernández de la Cruz, a little less than 1,400.
Bustos demanded to receive half their armament, munitions and head of cattle, to what Cruz seemed to accept at the beginning. But at noon he started a march towards the south, without having delivered the promised goods.
Bustos ordered Heredia to pursue his former commander, and he reached him when he was already surrounded by López's federalist troops (they were already in Santa Fe Province, a federalist stronghold). Seeing he could not continue forward, Fernández de la Cruz decided to give his army to Bustos and returned to Buenos Aires almost alone, only followed by a few loyal officers, Lamadrid among them.
The next day, Bustos started his return to Córdoba, and on January 12 he arrived on Esquina, on Córdoba's border. He wrote López and Rondeau from there, explaining what had occurred, and his plans to return to the fight in the north. In one of those letters he clarified: 
After Arequito.
After meeting with López's envoys at La Herradura, by the Tercero River, Bustos moved his army to Córdoba Province, where he was triumphantly received. Governor Manuel Antonio Castro had recently resigned and a new interim governor, José Javier Díaz, chief of the local federalists was elected. An assembly declared:
This means, the same sentiments that Bustos and the other participants of the Arequito rebellion had.
Rondeau comfronted Ramírez and López with its own forces at the Battle of Cepeda and was thoroughly defeated. Only a week later, he resigned and dissolved the Congress of Tucumán. There was not to be a new Supreme Director, due to pressure from López and Ramírez, Buenos Aires designated a provincial governor who signed the Treaty of Pilar with the federalists.
While in Córdoba, Bustos learned of the end of the Directorship, and he started a campaign to reorganize the country, delaying the return of the Northern Army to the northern border. At the same time, interim governor Díaz announced he was thinking of an association with the "Littoral" Caudillos (Santa Fé, Entre Ríos and Corrientes Provinces) in their fight against Buenos Aires; that is, to sign some alliance pact with José Gervasio Artigas, Ramírez or López.
That was not Bustos' objective, so he actively opposed Díaz' policies. Looking for allies, he reached the federalists of Juan Pablo Bulnes, who were distanced from Díaz's group, and various local politicians and influential local businessmen. With their support he was elected governor on March 19.
Bustos then dedicated himself to govern and organize the Province, and he mediated between López and the Buenos Aires Province government, who were still confronting each other. He sent colonel Heredia with a portion of the army to the provinces of the north, as an advance party of the promised march to resume war with the royalists. Unfortunately, Heredia did not get to fight the Spaniards, as his force was used by Martín Miguel de Güemes in the rebellion against the governor of Tucumán.
The remaining forces were used for the defense of the Province against the Pampas and Chaco native tribes and, the following year, to repel the combined attack of Francisco Ramírez and José Miguel Carrera.
Historical Review.
The Arequito Revolt was reported by early historians in a bad light. The chronicles by Lamadrid and Paz, labeled it as treason to the motherland or as an obscure event organized to place Bustos in the Córdoba government house and nothing more. Historians in the second half of the 19th century, starting with Bartolomé Mitre and Vicente Fidel López accused him of both. Nobody dared to defend Bustos and his followers, and as the defeat of the federalist party in the civil wars carried forward their enemies, this point of view was the one which survived.
Many years later, the school of Argentina historical revisionism started to see the Arequito Revolt with different eyes. Also, Córdoba historians valued their first autonomous governors, who had supported or participated in the events. At mid-20th century, with the historical revisionism firmly established, and with the apogee of the historical overvaluation of San Martín (who also had refused to participate in the civil war), the Arequito Revolt was seen as an important step in the formation of modern Argentina.
In effect, the rebellion of the Army of the North permitted the provinces to impose their will for the first time over the central government in Buenos Aires, made the strange and almost monarchist unitarian party constitution of 1819 disappear, permitted the birth of the autonomous government in Buenos Aires Province, equalized the rights of the people, and opened the way for an equal treatment and relations between the provinces (path that will prove to be difficult, as it would still need 50 more years of civil wars in Argentina).
Possibly, if the Army of the North would have followed its path to the north, the war between Buenos Aires and the federalists from the Litoral provinces would have lasted much longer, and the inevitable formation of a modern federalist Argentine nation would have been more difficult.
It is without doubt that the rebellion was an act of military disobedience, which, seen from a military point of view is totally inadmissible, but considering its political causes and results, it was a positive step towards a democracy with equal right for all.

Adolph Brower House

The Adolph Brower House is located at the corner of Division and Water streets in New Hamburg, New York, United States, opposite the Abraham Brower House. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
It was built around 1845 by Brower, a New York City native who owned a nearby lime quarry. A brick Greek Revival structure with many of the classic features of that style, it and the other Brower house are the oldest in New Hamburg to remain largely as they were originally built.
Building.
The house is at the southeast corner of a lot with a noncontributing swimming pool and outbuilding. Although it fronts on the stub end of Division Street (which once continued west to a dock) and is parallel with the other houses on that street, its address is Water Street.
It is a two-and-a-half-story, three-bay structure of brick laid in common bond topped with a slate gabled roof and wooden cornice. Two chimneys, one on the west exterior and an interior one from the northeast, rise from it. There are star-shaped anchor bolts between the stories on the east and west elevations.
The south (front) elevation has a two-story wooden porch with low hipped roof. Its square columns, duplicated in the porch of the Abraham Brower House on the opposite corner, have recessed panels and capitals. A similar single-bay porch, its upper level enclosed in clapboard, is attached to the east elevation. The front windows have stone sills and decorative lintels.
A third two-story porch on the west elevation, overlooking the nearby Hudson River, has also been enclosed with aluminum siding. The stone foundation comes up to the second floor here, behind the garage.
History.
A previous structure is shown on the site in an 1800 map, when the land was owned by early settler Ephraim DuBois. In 1837 Adolph Brower came up from New York City and bought the property. He built the house to overlook lime quarrying and kiln operations nearby. His customers were local pig iron producers and farmers and builders as far away as New Jersey, supplied by river boat.
In 1870 the superintendent of the Poughkeepsie Iron Works, Albert Tower, bought the house and property. He destroyed all the kilns and concentrated strictly on quarrying limestone, outcrops of which are still visible behind the house. Over the course of the 20th century, as New Hamburg's industries declined, the road was closed and the property relandscaped extensively. But other than the addition of some more modern building materials, and the exact rebuilding of some of the front porch trim, the house itself has not been altered.
Aesthetics.
Many of the features of the house typify it as Greek Revival. The gable returns, eyebrow windows, columned porch and side hall interior are particularly prominent. The entryway sidelights and transom, along with the finely done balustrade, are highly developed applications of the style.

Level luffing crane

A level-luffing crane is a crane mechanism where the hook remains at the same level whilst luffing; moving the jib up and down, so as to move the hook inwards and outwards relative to the base.
Some types of crane are "inherently" level-luffing: those with a fixed horizontal jib, such as gantry, hammerhead or the fixed-jib tower cranes commonly used in construction. Usually though, the description is only applied to those with a luffing jib that have some "additional" mechanism applied to keep the hook level when luffing.
Level-luffing is most important when careful movement of a load near ground level is required, such as in construction or shipbuilding. This partially explains the popularity of fixed horizontal jibs in these fields.
Toplis cable luffing.
An early form of level-luffing gear was the "Toplis" design, invented by a Stothert & Pitt engineer in 1914. The crane jibs luffs as for a conventional crane, with the end of the jib rising and falling. The crane's hook is kept level by automatically paying out enough extra cable to compensate for this. This is also a purely mechanical linkage, arranged by the reeving of the hoist cables to the jib over a number of pulleys at the crane's apex above the cab, so that luffing the jib upwards allows more free cable and lowers the hook to compensate.
Horse-head jibs.
The usual mechanism for level-luffing in modern cranes is to add an additional "horse head" section to the top of the jib. By careful design of the geometry, this keeps level merely by the linked action of the pivots.
Powered level-luffing.
As cranes and their control systems became more sophisticated, it became possible to control the level of luffing directly, by winching the hoist cable in and out as needed. The first of these systems used mechanical clutches between luffing and hoist drums, giving simplicity and a "near level" result.
Later systems have used modern electronic controls and quickly reversible motors with good slow-speed control to the hoist winch motors, so as to give a positioning accuracy of inches. Some early systems used controllable hydraulic gearboxes to achieve the same result, but these added complexity and cost and so were only popular where high accuracy was needed, such as for shipbuilding.
Luffing cabs.
Luffing mechanisms have also been applied to the driver's cab being mounted on its own jib, following the movement of the crane's main jib 
Meccano models.
Cranes have long been a popular subject for Meccano models, and luffing cranes are no exception.

Cyanobiont

A cyanobiont is a cyanobacterium that lives in symbiosis with an eukaryote, sometimes inside the cells of the eukaryote. The cyanobiont fixes nitrogen, and sometimes also performs photosynthesis for the host organism. The cyanobiont is often vertically transmitted, this is the case for cyanobionts of diatoms, lichens, didemnid ascidians, "Azolla" ferns and some sponges. Some of these cyanobionts cannot live without the host organism.

National City, Illinois

National City, Illinois is a suburb of East St. Louis, Illinois. Incorporated in 1907, it was a company town for the St. Louis National Stockyards Company. In 1996, the company, which owned all residential property in the town, evicted all of its residents. The following year, because it had no residents, National City was dissolved by court order. Its site was subsequently annexed by nearby Fairmont City, Illinois.
History.
Background and context.
Following the American Civil War, the American economy began to undergo a dramatic change as smaller markets and operations were being replaced by more centralized and efficient ones. This was due in no small part to the advent of the railroads, which by this time crisscrossed much of the country and connected previously isolated producers to one another in a more expedient fashion. This transformation of the nation’s transportation network by railroads had a particularly strong impact on livestock-related industries. It eliminated the need for long cattle drives by connecting the producers of livestock (especially cattle) in the West with the major meat processing companies in the East. It also enabled livestock markets to become transregional, with animals being shipped to large, centralized markets for sale, processing and distribution. The result of this was that over time, smaller, localized markets became obsolete and a relatively small number of terminal livestock markets—markets built near important railroad centers—came to dominate the livestock and meatpacking industries. St. Louis, Missouri was a natural choice as one of these locations.
Situated near the juncture of the Missouri River and Mississippi River, the city of St. Louis had long been an important transportation center. Its access to these river systems coupled with its central location in the country had contributed to its becoming a major industrial center and railroad hub, with all the nation’s major rail lines converging in the city and from there running to all the different regions of the country. As railroads became the primary means by which livestock and processed meat was shipped, St. Louis developed into a major livestock and meatpacking center. This was also due to the fact that most of the U.S. population lived east of the Mississippi River prior to 1900, while most of the animals used to produce the meat it consumed were raised west of it, thus making St. Louis a logical place for the interchange between supply and demand in the meat market. However, the Mississippi River provided a hindrance to this movement of livestock and meat to the East at first, because until 1874, when the Eads Bridge was completed, no bridge linking Missouri to Illinois had been constructed. This meant that livestock from the West had to be unloaded in St. Louis, then ferried across the river to East St. Louis, Illinois, where it would then be stocked until it could be taken by railroad to eastern cities. This inefficiency provided additional costs to producers, both in time lost and money spent on ferry fees. It was these problems that caused a group of eastern financiers to invest in the construction of a large stockyard complex outside the already well-established rail center of East St. Louis.
The St. Louis National Stockyards Company is formed, 1873.
National City had its beginnings as a business investment by East-Coast venture capitalists in the early 1870s. East St. Louis mayor John Bowman had envisioned a new stockyard operation in East. St. Louis that would rival the famous Union Stock Yards in Chicago and make the stockyards in nearby St. Louis minor by comparison, and he approached a group of wealthy investors about establishing it. Most of these investors were railroad men, and virtually all of them were from the East. The man who led this group of investors was Archibald M. Allerton of the New York law firm Allerton, Dutcher and Moore, who also was one of the owners of New York’s National Drove Yard. Allerton and his fellow investors believed such an operation would be a successful venture, but had several conditions they wanted met before they would invest in East St. Louis: 1) they wanted to build their operation on land not incorporated into any existing city, so as to avoid strict regulations, with a promise that East St. Louis would never attempt annexation of their property, 2) they wanted to build their own infrastructure independently of East St. Louis, and 3) they wanted East St. Louis to provide their property with city services such as fire protection. Mayor Bowman acquiesced to these conditions, and the agreement was made official on July 17, 1872, at the East St. Louis city council meeting. The investors had purchased of land known as Gallagher Pastures (400 acres of which was procured from Mayor Bowman and W.D. Griswold for $145,000, and from Virginia Matthews for $50,000) on the northeast edge of East St. Louis upon which to build their new stockyard operation, and construction had begun on May 30, 1871. Ultimately, they would spend $1.5 million to construct the complex. It included of animal pens and for sheds, as well as the Allerton House (later known as the National Hotel, at which Theodore Roosevelt once stayed)—one of the finest hotels in the area—and a new Exchange Building. On October 31, 1872, the original 17 stockholders who had invested in the new stockyard operation met in Mayor Bowman’s office and elected the first Board of Directors for the operation, with Archibald Allerton as its first President. The St. Louis National Stockyards Company was incorporated in Illinois four days later on November 4 and officially opened for business on November 19, 1873.
The early years (1873-1907).
Consolidation and national prominence.
Once established, the St. Louis National Stockyards did not take long to become a major player in the livestock and meatpacking industries. The first shipment of cattle had arrived at the complex in June 1873, almost five months before the yards officially opened, and many more shipments would follow. The National Stockyards had been built to accommodate up to 15,000 head of cattle, 10,000 sheep, 20,000 hogs, in addition to a large quantity of non-meat animals such as horses and mules. This large capacity did not go unnoticed by the meatpacking firms in the East, who very shortly after the Stockyards’ inception began to build plants there—which the Stockyards’ board had anticipated by purchasing enough land to accommodate packinghouse operations alongside the yards. The centralization of stockyard operations along railroad terminals had led the major meatpacking companies to follow suit, locating their major operations near the stockyard operations to trim shipping costs connected to transporting whole animals by killing and processing their meat in a single location and shipping only the finished product. The first packinghouse operation to build a plant at the National Stockyards was the White House Provision Company. It was followed soon after by Richardson and Company’s East St. Louis Packing and Provision Company, which opened on November 13, 1873. Richardson’s was able to process 2,000 hogs per day at its beginning, and by the end of 1874 was processing 6,000 per day. Other packing companies began to arrive right on their heels. The St. Louis Beef Canning Company relocated to the Stockyards in 1879, and was followed closely by plants owned by the big-name meatpacking firms. Nelson Morris began operations at the Stockyards in 1889, Gustavus Swift arrived in 1893, and Philip Armour commenced production in 1903. There were also many other smaller firms who built plants near the yards, who along with the big operations helped to make the St. Louis area—and specifically the St. Louis National Stockyards—one of the nation’s premier meatpacking centers, with the Stockyards directly employing 1,200 workers and processing approximately 50,000 animals weekly and boasting sales of more than $2 million each year at the turn of the 20th century.
Related industries and infrastructure.
The centralization of the stockyard and packinghouse operations at the St. Louis National Stockyards also led to the creation and expansion of other related industries at the site. The National Stock Yards National Bank, established with the yards in 1873, became a major financial institution in the St. Louis area, helping to finance the day-to-day operations of the yards. Up until the end of World War II, it would be the largest Illinois bank outside of Chicago. Another major development came as the meatpacking firms began to realize that they could use the vast amount of animal by-products produced by their factories to create new industries—some of which became established at the Stockyards. Other industries related to livestock also became established there, such as seed and feed businesses, companies that dealt in hardware and farm machinery, lumber, and fertilizer, and tanning and rendering plants. 
Other services and infrastructure soon followed. The St. Louis Live Stock Exchange was established in 1885 to manage livestock trading at the site, and it did not take long until the Stockyards had a United States Post Office, telegraph offices and the offices of "The Daily National Live Stock Reporter", a trade newspaper. The Stockyards had paved roads, which East St. Louis did not have at the time, and its own waterworks that provided cleaner drinking water for the animals there than was available for the people living in downtown St. Louis at the time. It also boasted a system of fire hydrants to protect the operation from catastrophe. In the words of Dr. Andrew Theising, a scholar who has studied East St. Louis and the surrounding area, the St. Louis National Stockyards had quickly become “a world unto itself”, and it would not be long until it became officially a town unto itself.
National City, Illinois incorporates, 1907.
As the St. Louis National Stockyards and its related industries grew and became established, they returned no small dividends for their investors and provided large profits for both livestock owners and meatpacking firms. However, things quickly became more complicated for the yards. The federal government began to push for food regulations and standards, spurred on by Upton Sinclair’s novel "The Jungle", which chronicled the meatpacking industry; the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt had begun to oppose what it called the “beef trust”; and the city of East St. Louis had tried to annex the yards, in violation of the agreement it had made with the company prior to the construction of the complex. In order to counter the increasing intervention of government into its affairs, the St. Louis National Stockyards and its related commercial interests incorporated as National City, Illinois, in July 1907. National City was in all respects a company town, as the St. Louis National Stockyards Company owned all the property in the town. The town consisted of two streets a block long, with about 40 houses arranged in four rows on them, a building that served as a church and school, a police/fire station and a store. The village had a population at its height of 300, all of whom were employees of the stockyards. Everything in the town was under the direct control of the company, from the mayor (handpicked by the company, the town only saw three changes of mayor between 1907 and 1982) to the tax assessments. This control enabled the St. Louis National Stockyards Company to efficiently run its own affairs with minimal outside governmental interference such as taxation and regulation. National City was the first industrial suburb outside East St. Louis, and it would set an example to be followed by other major industries in the St. Louis area, establishing such other company towns on the Illinois side of the Mississippi as Granite City (steel), Alorton (aluminum), Sauget (chemicals) and Wood River and Roxana (oil refinery).
From incorporation through World War II (1907-1947).
Continued growth.
Following its incorporation as National City, the St. Louis National Stockyards continued to grow as a livestock and meat processing center. World War I in particular expedited this growth. The Stockyards had numerous government contracts, both for supplying meat and providing horses and mules for use as pack animals. By 1920, National City had 14,000 people working there, and the St. Louis National Stockyards had the largest horse and mule market in the world, which would continue until shortly after the end of World War II. In addition, it placed third among American cattle markets and second among hog markets. In 1919, the total money received by the Stockyards was $8,257,798, illustrating the success of the yards during this time. However, World War I and its immediate aftermath would also cause the beginnings of dramatic changes for the Stockyards and its related operations—changes that would ultimately be the beginning of the end for National City.
Regulation.
During the first world war, inflation began to play a major toll on the Stockyards. Yardage fees were 20% higher than they had been before the war, and price levels were 60% higher at the end of the war than they had been in 1914. Exchange members increased their fees charged to livestock producers as well and the producers, feeling they were being cut out of wartime profits by these practices and conditions, appealed to the federal government to regulate the industry.
The federal government responded by passing the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921. This law gave to the U.S. Department of Agriculture regulatory rights over ownership, trading practices and financial transactions in the stockyard industry. Perhaps most importantly, though, it separated the stockyard and meatpacking industries by forcing the major meatpacking firms to give up their majority interests in stockyard companies. The major business interests in these industries would fight back fiercely against this law’s regulations, to no avail, over the next 20 years. This mandated divorce between the stockyard and meatpacking industries would be the first step toward the decentralization of both industries later in the 20th century—a major factor in the decline of National City. However, another major factor evolving in the market during this period would have an even greater impact on National City and hasten its demise: the truck.
From railroad to truck: transportation evolves.
The first truckload of hogs rolled into National City in 1921. It would not be the last. Over the next two decades, trucks would gain a greater and greater percentage of the volume of animals delivered to the Stockyards, gradually supplanting the formerly powerful and important railroads as the most important mode of shipment for the yards. By 1938, 60% of the livestock shipped to National City came by truck, and by 1952, that number would grow to 99% of hogs and 84% of all other animals. Following World War II, the Stockyards would respond to the evolution of the nation’s transportation network and the increasing mechanization of industry. The yards were converted to handle truck traffic, and the last auctions of work horses and mules took place in 1948, as those animals became obsolete with the increasing ubiquity of farm machinery. This shift from railroad-based shipping to truck-based shipping would threaten the terminal livestock markets across the nation as the livestock and meatpacking industries evolved right alongside the transportation network.
Labor issues.
Another major change that affected National City during the first half of the 20th century was the unionization of packinghouse workers. Originally, the packinghouses—and the Stockyards themselves—had targeted immigrants who would work cheap to man their operations. The “de-skilling” of labor on the assembly lines of the packinghouses meant that workers could be hired with no experience and without even being able to speak English to work for a fraction of what it might cost to pay domestic workers. National City advertised in Europe, soliciting immigrants primarily from Eastern Europe to come to the U.S. to work in the packinghouses. Many thousands arrived in National City and the surrounding area, establishing themselves and making their living in the meatpacking plants. The poor working conditions and low pay of the packinghouses and the rise of unionism during this period, however, ultimately led the packinghouse workers to organize and resist their employers, seeking better wages and working conditions. 
Of course, the major meatpacking firms opposed this trend. Apprehensive of a unified, well-organized labor force, meatpackers—like many other industrialists of this period—hired people from many diverse, non-English-speaking ethnic groups in order to hinder the organization of their employees into unions. Another tactic used by the meatpackers was to bring in African-Americans from the South as replacement workers to create tension and discourage unionization and strikes. This latter move played a major role in causing the infamous East St. Louis Race Riots of 1917. However, the packers were not ultimately able to quell the fires of unionization, and by the 1950s virtually all the industries in National City—packinghouses, railroads, etc.—had become union workplaces. This led to increased wages and improved working conditions, including shorter workdays, as well as periodic strikes. These changes in management/labor would eventually play a major role in the packing companies choosing to relocate to the countryside in search of cheaper, nonunion labor.
Decline (1947-1997).
The industry changes.
The peak year for the National City Stockyards came in 1947, with 1,860,000 cattle—in addition to other animals—being unloaded there. The Stockyards continued to do well through the 1950s. Receipts of cattle vacillated during this decade, but National City competed for first in the nation in hog receipts, eventually surpassing Chicago and Omaha to become the largest hog market in the world in 1954 and earning East St. Louis the epithet “Hog Capital of the Nation”. However, though National City would continue to dominate the hog market for the next decade, its fortunes were changing with the market. The advent of the truck—and later, the interstate highway system—coupled with rising labor costs connected to unionization and the antiquation of outdated factories was causing the meatpacking industry to decentralize and relocate away from centralized terminal markets such as National City to rural areas, where it could find cheaper, nonunion labor, build new factories close to the livestock producers and buy directly from them, thus eliminating the middleman of the stockyard industry and cutting costs. 
In 1959, National City placed fourth among major stockyards in the nation. However, as the 1960s began, its gradual decline had begun in earnest. The Armour packinghouse in National City was the first plant owned by a major national firm to close in 1959, laying off 1,400 employees. It would not be the last. By 1986, the last meatpacking plant located in National City had closed its doors, ending an era. As this process of decentralization was underway, the Stockyards themselves continued to gradually diminish in importance to the livestock industry as well. By 1963, National City had slipped to fifth in stockyard production, losing its place atop the hog market in 1967 to Omaha, and it dropped to third place just a year later as St. Paul overtook it. This was evidence not just of National City’s decline, but also that of terminal livestock markets as a whole across the country. In 1970, St. Louis National Stockyards Company President Gilbert Novotny stated that 30% of livestock sold in the U.S. was sold through terminal markets, a dramatic decline from the 90% sales terminal markets boasted in the 1920s. This precipitous decline mirrored the loss of packinghouse operations to the rural countryside. In 1965, the St. Louis Metro-East region, of which National City was a part, had 43 packing plants processing 100,000 animals weekly; by 1970, just five years later, there were 32. In National City, Hunter Packing Company closed its doors in 1980, laying off 1,100 workers; Royal Packing Company followed closely behind in January 1981. They were followed by others, until Swift Independent Packing Company, the last packinghouse located in National City, shut down for good in 1986.
The stockyards attempt to adjust.
The St. Louis National Stockyards Company attempted to reverse its declining fortunes, to no avail. They introduced the first stocker and feeder cattle auctions in October 1960, and they undertook conversion projects aimed at making the yards more truck-friendly, but these efforts to revitalize the Stockyards were ultimately unsuccessful. The industry had changed. Livestock farming in the U.S. had undergone a paradigm shift from a large number of small farmers to a relatively small number of huge corporate farms, where animals could be grown to full-size independently of a centralized stockyard operation. The interstate highway system constructed in the 1950s enabled the major meatpacking firms to bypass the railroads and terminal stockyard operations and purchase their animals directly from the producers, and with the advent of refrigerated trucks, the packing firms could locate their plants near the source of the animals, being able to ship their products anywhere in the country. This also provided them a way to avoid costly labor in unionized major cities, as most countryside labor pools were unorganized. The National City Stockyards were but one victim of this evolution in the market. Across the nation, the major terminal livestock markets were becoming obsolete and shutting down. The Chicago Union Stock Yards, long the industry leader, closed down in 1971; that year, the St. Louis National Stockyards Company was one of only 11 remaining terminal markets in the nation. 
As the decline continued, the St. Louis National Stockyards saw many changes. The number of commission houses was cut in half—from 12 to 6—between 1971 and 1990, and the Stockyards went from employing 100 full-time workers to employing just 34. The National Hotel, no longer necessary as shippers made their trips in one day by truck, was shuttered and demolished in 1986. That same year, a fire destroyed the Exchange building—a metaphoric picture of what was happening to the Stockyards themselves at that time. In addition, the industries that the meatpacking industry had spawned at the yards, such as hide processing, rendering, and fertilizer and feed operations, began to leave as well as the meatpacking industry in National City dried up.
Closing down, 1997.
In April of 1996, the Saint Louis National Stockyards Company, which owned all of the residential property in National City, ordered the town's approximately 50 remaining residents to leave. The Board of Saint Clair County then requested that the United States Census Bureau conduct a special census of National City, for the purpose of determining whether the town had a sufficient number of residents to avoid dissolution. The Census Bureau conducted the census, and found that the town had no residents. The Board then filed a petition in the county's Circuit Court, requesting an order that the town be dissolved. The Board relied on an Illinois statute that permitted the dissolution of an incorporated community that had fewer than 50 residents according to the most recent federal census. The Circuit Court granted the petition in 1997, and ordered the town dissolved. National City, as well as private citizens who had intervened in the case, appealed the order, but the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed it on October 3, 1997. National City's incorporated existence thus came to end.
Though greatly diminished in importance, the Stockyards would continue to hold hog and cattle auctions until 1997. Due to the dramatic changes in the livestock market and diminished receipts, the company closed down its livestock division by the end of the year.
The town of Fairmont City, Illinois subsequently annexed the site of National City in 1999.
National City, Illinois is a testament to the dramatic changes in American industry during the late 19th century and the 20th century. Established as a centralized terminal livestock market, it owed its existence to the railroads, which transformed the livestock and meatpacking industries from spread-out, localized operations to consolidated and integrated major complexes in central urban locations. When the market evolved again in the mid-20th century with the interstate highway system and trucking coming to prominence, the railroads—once king of shipping—began to diminish, and with them the terminal markets as meatpackers were able to bypass the middlemen of the railroad and stockyard companies, leading to the meatpacking and livestock industries once again becoming decentralized. This ultimately led to National City’s demise.
Present.
In the years after its dissolution, National City was essentially a ghost town. There were no residents living there, and much of the land was a post-industrial wasteland, with the remains of dilapidated factories—many overgrown with vegetation and covered in graffiti—standing as empty, crumbling shells, testifying to the one-time greatness of the St. Louis National Stockyards as a national meatpacking and livestock center. 
Nevertheless, National City was not completely abandoned. Several industries moved there, including Darling, International, a major rendering company, a recycling plant and Baily International, one of America's largest manufacturers of Asian foods as well as several warehouse, heavy machinery and trucking operations. In addition, as of April 2010, there were several construction projects begun on the property as part of what was called the National City Redevelopment Area. 
A further injection of life into the area came with the planning and construction of the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge, which will carry Interstate 70 over the Mississippi River and which is expected to open in approximately March of 2014. The new bridge will have its first Illinois exit near the site of National City. This made the site attractive to industry and highly marketable. In the summer of 2012, a new river grain terminal was opened in the area because of its proximity to the future exit. In 2013, local leaders were hoping that the bridge would spark further economic development in the area.
Traffic Tickets.
In 1990, National City received attention because of the large number of traffic tickets that its police department issued for moving violations on the one-mile stretch of Illinois Route 3 that bisected the small town. Although the town had only 70 residents at the time, it had a police department with five full-time officers and seven part-time officers. In 1989, the officers issued 5,091 citations for alleged moving violations on Route 3. Most of the citations were for speeding, though some drivers were cited for multiple violations. Payments of the fines for the citations in 1989 brought more than $122,000 of revenue into the town's treasury, amounting to approximately one quarter of the town government's annual budget.
The town's police chief said at the time that drivers were ticketed for speeding only if they exceeded the posted speed limit by at least 10 miles per hour. The town's assistant police chief said that the enforcement program had been started five or six years earlier after residents complained about the number of accidents on Route 3. The assistant police chief also said that the 35 mile per hour speed limit on Route 3 in the town was clearly marked by multiple signs, and that the purpose of the enforcement program was to deter speeding and to prevent people from getting killed.

Princes Mall Shopping Centre

Princes Mall (formerly Waverley Market and later Waverley Shopping Centre) is a shopping centre in Edinburgh, Scotland.
It is located at the east end of Princes Street in the City Centre, next to Edinburgh Waverley railway station. Once home to independent retailers, it now houses mainly high street chain stores, as well as a large food court.
Designed in the early 1980s, it was built with its roof at the street level of Princes Street, with a landscaped plaza at that level, in order to preserve the view from Princes Street across to Edinburgh Castle and the Old Town. It opened as Waverley Market in November 1984, the name referencing the food market that once occupied the site. An official opening by Queen Elizabeth II took place on 25 July 1985.
In the centre's early years the atria were adorned by luxuriant planting and water features, with shoppers descending on escalators from Princes Street through a canopy of trees to the underground plaza.
Major refurbishment in the early 1990s coincided with a change of name to Waverley Shopping Centre. A prominent and popular aspect of the mall introduced at this time was the large water feature which dominated the main atrium and incorporated the 11ft high Herons Dream sculpture. This was removed during refurbishment in the early 2000s when the centre adopted its current name.
The mall suffered a decline in popularity in the early 2000s with 12 of the retail units empty at one stage. Major new lettings to fashion retailers CULT and AB10 may indicate the reversal of this decline helped by the improvements carried out by Network Rail to the Waverley Steps access to Waverley Station by the installation of new stairs and escalators, with a glazed roof, and lifts.
Edinburgh's main tourist information centre is located within the same development. It is accessed through a separate entrance on top of the mall.

Sandra Thompson (linguist)

Sandra Annear Thompson is an American linguist specializing in discourse analysis, typology, and interactional linguistics. She has published numerous books and her research has appeared in many linguistics journals. She is currently Professor Emerita of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and serves on the editorial board of several prominent linguistics journals.
Thompson is known for her large body of research on Mandarin grammar, much of which she has conducted in collaboration with UCSB colleague Charles Li. Their 1981 book "Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar" is widely cited and often compared to Yuen Ren Chao's "A Grammar of Spoken Chinese" (1968). That work, along with her earlier work in Chinese resultative verb compounds, was a major contribution to the study of Chinese morphosyntax, and stood apart from contemporary research in that it devoted attention to the internal structure of Chinese compound words, whereas other research focused on the syntactic nature of compound words. She has also conducted research on discourse and grammar, collaborating with linguistics such as Paul Hopper on topics including transitivity and emergent grammar. With Christian Matthiessen and Bill Mann she developed rhetorical structure theory. 
Thompson and Charles Li also carried out extensive documentation of the Wappo language, and, with Joseph Sung-yul Park, published a reference grammar of the language in 2006.

The Brass Verdict

The Brass Verdict is the 19th novel by American author Michael Connelly and features the second appearance of Los Angeles criminal defense attorney Michael "Mickey" Haller. Connelly introduced Haller in his bestselling 2005 novel "The Lincoln Lawyer".
Plot summary.
Since the events of the previous novel, attorney Mickey Haller has spent a year recuperating from his wounds and a subsequent addiction to painkillers. He is called back to the practice of law when an old acquaintance, defense attorney Jerry Vincent, is murdered. Haller inherits Vincent's caseload, which includes the high-profile trial of Walter Elliott, a Hollywood mogul accused of murdering his wife Mitzi and her German lover. Haller secures this "franchise" case, persuading the mogul to keep him on as counsel by promising not to seek a postponement of the trial, which is due to start in nine days. 
Meanwhile, maverick LAPD detective Harry Bosch, the main character in several earlier novels written by Connelly, is investigating Vincent's murder. Bosch, warning that Vincent's killer may come after Haller next, persuades the reluctant lawyer to cooperate in the ongoing murder investigation. Meanwhile, Haller shakes off the rust, and lingering self-doubts, as he prepares for the double-murder trial. 
Among the cases Haller takes on is that of a former surfing champion, Patrick, who, while addicted to painkillers after a surfing accident, has stolen a diamond necklace while at the home of a friend. Haller feels sorry for Patrick because of his own history of addiction, and employs the young man to drive his Lincoln. He manages to get Patrick off the charges against him by playing on a hunch that the stolen diamonds were not genuine.
Assisted by his investigator, Cisco, and his office assistant, Lorna (who is one of Haller's two ex-wives), Haller works out a strategy to defend his client, based on the fact that the gunshot residue found on Elliott's hands is the result of having travelled in a police car used earlier in the day to transport another prisoner. He also throws doubt as to whether the couple's murderer was actually after Mitzi or her lover. In the meantime, Walter admits that he is involved with the Mafia and that he believes they murdered both his wife and the lawyer Jerry Vincent.
On the strength of information from Bosch, Haller becomes suspicious that Vincent has bribed someone in the legal process to plant a jury member who would help obtain an acquittal for Walter Elliott, regardless of the evidence. On investigation, he finds that one of the jurors has stolen someone else's identity, and he ensures that this information becomes known to the judge in the Elliott case, resulting in the trial being brought to a halt just as it begins to go Haller's way. Elliott, however, confesses to Haller that he actually did kill Mitzi and her lover, and Haller is left pondering on the outcome of the case. During the evening he receives a call from the police, asking him to help a former client. When he arrives on the scene, he is attacked by a man who attempts to push him over a precipice. Bosch and his team, who have been observing Haller, arrive on the scene just in time to prevent the murder, and the attacker is discovered to be the planted juryman. 
Haller figures out that the person behind the corruption is in fact a senior judge, and confronts her with his evidence, leading to her arrest by the FBI. When he learns that Walter Elliott and his secretary have also been murdered, he assumes she is behind that murder, but it turns out that justice has been dispensed by Mitzi lover's family before their return to Germany.
Unknown to Haller, but revealed in previous Connelly novels, is the fact that Bosch is Haller's half-brother. Haller works out the puzzle by the end of the book, going mainly on the resemblances between Bosch and his own father (himself a lawyer) but at this point no arrangement is made for the two men to meet again.
Awards.
The novel won the 2009 Anthony Award for "Best Novel". It was also nominated for the CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger in the same year at the Crime Thriller Awards.

2008–09 British Columbia pipeline bombings

The 2008–09 British Columbia pipeline bombings were a series of bombs that targeted gas pipelines owned by EnCana near the towns of Dawson Creek and Tomslake, British Columbia. The first blast occurred on October 12, 2008 and the second overnight between October 15 and October 16. The third was discovered on October 31 and a fourth was reported on January 5, 2009. The attacks brought to question the safety of the energy installations in Canada.
Timeline.
On October 10, 2008 letters were sent to local media outlets warning oil and gas companies to leave the area saying: "We will no longer negotiate with terrorists which you are as you keep endangering our families with crazy expansion of deadly gas wells in our home lands". The Royal Canadian Mounted Police warned the companies; however no further action was taken.
On October 12 an explosion occurred on a sour gas pipeline to the east of Dawson Creek British Columbia. The explosion left a 2.5 meter and 2 meter deep crater but did not rupture the pipeline. Had the explosion ruptured the pipeline, toxic gases would most likely have been released. The RCMP sent a specialized team to investigate the explosion four days later.
On October 16 a second blast hit a natural gas pipeline. Workers discovered the blast site at approximately 10:00 a.m. MT off of British Columbia Highway 2. This explosion also did not rupture the pipeline but left a crater in the ground. Following the explosion the Integrated National Security Enforcement Team (INSET) were called in to assist in the investigation of the explosion.
The following day RCMP called a press conference to state that they believe the public is safe despite admitting that it would be very difficult to protect the large expanse of pipeline in the area.
On October 24 police arrested a person in Alberta they believe may have had something to do with the blasts.
On October 31, a third bomb detonated at a natural gas wellhead in the region of Dawson Creek (12 kilometers northwest of Tomslake). Encana reported minimal damage.
On January 5, 2009 a fourth blast destroyed a metering shed near the community of Tomslake.
Investigation.
The RCMP has been quick to try to convince the public that they believe this is not an "act of terrorism" and simply an act of sabotage by one person or group. On October 17 RCMP spokesman Sgt. Tim Shields released the following statement: "We believe someone or a group of people have set two deliberate explosions that were intended to rupture and blow up a natural-gas pipeline".
It has also been suggested that the bombings may be associated with the growing annoyance amongst the agricultural community of having pipelines crisscrossing the land. Wiebo Ludwig was arrested in connection with the pipeline bombings on January 8, 2010. He was previously convicted in 2001 of similar bombings which targeted oil and gas pipelines. After an extensive search of his farm by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, he was released without charge.

<doc id="19806564" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19806564" title="Chaldean Mafia">
Chaldean Mafia

The Chaldean Mafia, composed predominantly of Iraqi nationals, ethnic Assyrians/Chaldeans, operated a narcotics distribution network moving drugs from Phoenix and San Diego to Detroit. Involved in violent crimes such as homicide, assault, kidnapping, armed robbery, and arson, the gang use intimidation and brutal force to move the narcotics and collect drug proceeds.
The work of the Detroit Metropolitan Violent Crime Task Force—with representatives from the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); the Detroit Police Department; the Michigan State Police Department; and the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office—resulted in the conviction of 111 subjects and the seizure of $5.3 million, 6.5 tons of marijuana, 25 kilograms of cocaine, five pounds of crystal methamphetamine, and 78 firearms.
In 2011 "Operation Shadowbox", a joint investigation between El Cajon, California police and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration into the trafficking of narcotics, firearms and explosives, allowed for the seizure of more than 13 pounds of methamphetamine; more than 5 pounds of ecstasy, pharmaceuticals, crack cocaine, heroin and cocaine; and more than 3,500 pounds of marijuana, most of which was likely smuggled through maritime routes controlled by the Sinaloa Federation. Investigators also seized more than $630,000 in cash, three luxury cars, 34 firearms and four improvised explosive devices.
Ethnic Background.
The Chaldean Mafia is composed of ethnic Assyrians (Known as Chaldo-Assyrians) who are predominantly followers of the Chaldean Catholic Church.
Participants.
Bahaa, born January 31, 1962, is currently serving time under the name Bahaa Kalasko, MDOC #181993. Regarded in the 1980s as “the leader of a strong-arm gang of thugs”, Bahaa received a life sentence in 1985 “after he and his gang murdered an elderly woman during a home invasion robbery”.
Bahaa’s uncle is Louis Akrawi who is an entrepreneur, but had a dual identity: “while Akrawi held the appearance of a respectable businessman on the surface, the residents of the Chaldean community recognized him as their version of the local mafia boss”. Three members of the Chaldean Mafia were killed on November 20, 2002, Christopher Kasshamoun, Wesam Akrawi, and Rany Sharak.
Born in Iraq, Ragheed aka Ray Akrawi was the first cousin and closest companion of Harry Kalasho. Authorities were successful in securing an 18-month jail term for a firearms violation in August 1990. While serving that term, Akrawi was named in a grand jury indictment which named him, his uncle and 7 other members of the organization with drug conspiracy. Ray along with Basil Mezy, Nick Konja and Basam Jarges among others were eventually convicted on the charges. Kalasho is currently serving two prison sentences in the Michigan Department of Corrections. He has a life sentence for murder and a 40-year sentence for armed robbery.

SR.N6

The Saunders-Roe (later British Hovercraft Corporation) SR.N6 hovercraft (also known as the "Winchester" class) was a larger version of the earlier SR.N5 series. It incorporated several features that resulted in it quickly becoming the most produced and successful hovercraft design in the world. Compared to the SR.N5, the SR.N6 Mk.1 was stretched in length, with over double the seating capacity. 
While the SR.N2 and SR.N5s operated in commercial service as trials craft, the SR.N6 was the first production craft to enter commercial service. Experience with the design would lead to the very large automobile ferry SR.N4, which is no longer in service.
Configuration.
After initial trials the prototype was operated by Scandinavian Hovercraft Promotions of Oslo, Norway under the name 'Scanhover'. It entered service in June 1965 and it was later joined by 011. They operated on a 120 mile route, with six stopping points, in the Aalesund area. These craft were later operated between Aarhus and Kalundborg in Denmark and in February and March 1966 also successfully underwent cold weather trials in Sweden, in the Gulf of Bothnia.
The increase length of the SR.N6 allowed it to accommodate 38 passengers instead of the 18 carried by the SR.N5. It was subsequently extended again to accommodate a further 20 passengers. This made SR.N6 commercial operations much more viable than any previous hovercraft design. By eventually increasing the capacity to 58 seats the Mk.1S became the first hovercraft capable of transporting a typical coach load of people.
Military use.
Military variants have seen service with the Italian Navy, Egyptian Navy, Iraqi Navy (Mk 6C), Iranian Navy and the Saudi Arabian Frontier Force.
Civilian use.
In 1998 the Canadian Coast Guard decommissioned its last SR.N6 that was in active service, commissioned as CCGH "045".
Survivors.
The original prototype SR.N6 Mk.1 (009) is currently on display at the Hovercraft Museum in Lee-on-the-Solent, Hampshire, England. With 22,000 hours of service over a twenty-year period it is the world's most extensively operated hovercraft. The museum has several other SR.N6 on display or in various states of restoration. One is operational and occasionally used for demonstrations.
Capacity.
The SR.N6 class is capable of carrying 55 fully equipped troops, or 6 tons of equipment.
Toys.
The SR.N6 has been the subject of two popular toy versions. A small metal replica was produced for over twenty years by Matchbox Toys, while a much larger die-cast version was produced in the 1970s by Dinky Toys. A 12.7 cm model was released by Matchbox in 1974 as part of their Super Kings range.

The Stanly News and Press

The Stanly News and Press is a newspaper published on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday located in Stanly County, North Carolina.
History.
"The Second Century" was published for the first time June 10, 1880. The connection between this paper and "The Stanly Gleaner", published in Norwood, is not clear, but it was believed the "Gleaner" used equipment from "The Second Century". Investors took over the "Gleaner" and changed the name to "The Stanly Observer". John R. Elkins was the first publisher.
In 1890, The Old Armchair Club bought the paper and made J.D. Bivins editor and publisher; the paper's name was changed to "The Stanly News". T. J. Jerome bought the paper in 1893. Editor R.A. Crowell changed the name to " The Stanly Enterprise". Bivins bought the paper in 1898.
In 1912, the paper's name changed to the "Albemarle Enterprise". W.A. Bivins replaced J.D. Bivins as editor. By 1918, the name had changed again, to the "Albemarle News".
J.D. Bivins took over once again December 10, 1919, and the next day the "News" merged with the "Stanly County Herald", started that year with A.C. Huneycutt the editor. Huneycutt remained in his position with the "Stanly News-Herald". 
Bivins sold his share of the "News-Herald" in 1920, and in 1922 bought the "Piedmont Press", which became the "Albemarle Press". Bivins became president of Press Printing Company in 1927, with S.R. Andrew the vice-president and "Press" editor John B. Harris secretary-treasurer. Press Printing bought the "News-Herald", and on December 3, 1929, the papers berged to become the "Stanly News and Press".

Brian Kobilka

Brian Kent Kobilka (born May 30, 1955) is an American Nobel Prize awarded professor in the departments of Molecular and Cellular Physiology at Stanford University School of Medicine. He is also the co-founder of ConfometRx, a biotechnology company focusing on G protein-coupled receptors. He was named a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2011.
Early life.
Kobilka, a Roman Catholic, attended St. Mary's Grade School in Little Falls, Minnesota, a part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Cloud. He then Graduated from Little Falls High School. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in Biology and Chemistry from the University of Minnesota Duluth, and earned his M.D., "cum laude", from Yale University School of Medicine. Following the completion of his residency in internal medicine at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, Kobilka worked in research as a postdoctoral fellow under Robert Lefkowitz at Duke University, where he started work on cloning the β2-adrenergic receptor. Kobilka moved to Stanford in 1989. He was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator from 1987-2003.
Research.
Kobilka is best known for his research on the structure and activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); in particular, work from Kobilka's laboratory determined the molecular structure of the β2-adrenergic receptor. This work has been highly cited by other scientists because GPCRs are important targets for pharmaceutical therapeutics, but notoriously difficult to work with in X-ray crystallography. Before, rhodopsin was the only G-protein coupled receptor where the structure had been determined at high resolution. The β2-adrenergic receptor structure was soon followed by the determination of the molecular structure of several other G-protein coupled receptors.
Kobilka is the 1994 recipient of the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics John J. Abel Award in Pharmacology. His GPCR structure work was named "runner-up" for the 2007 "Breakthrough of the Year" award from "Science". The work was, in part, supported by Kobilka's 2004 Javits Neuroscience Investigator Award from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. He received the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Robert Lefkowitz for his work on G protein-coupled receptors.
Personal life.
Kobilka is from Little Falls in central Minnesota. Both his grandfather Felix J. Kobilka (1893-1991) and his father Franklyn A. Kobilka (1921-2004) were bakers and natives of Little Falls, Minnesota. Kobilka's grandmother, Isabelle Susan Kobilka (née Medved, 1891-1980), belonged to the Medved and Kiewel families of Prussian immigrants, who from 1888 owned the historical Kiewel brewery in Little Falls. His mother is Betty L. Kobilka (née Faust, b. 1930).
Kobilka met his wife Tong Sun Thian, a Malaysian-Chinese woman, at the University of Minnesota Duluth. They have two children, Jason and Megan Kobilka.

Effets de soir

Effets de soir (also called effets desoir or effets de soir et de matin) are the effects of light caused by the sunset, twilight, or darkness of the early evening or matins. They appear frequently in works by such painters as Vincent van Gogh, Bernard Fries, Armand Guillaumin, and Camille Corot. Literally, it means "effects of evening" in French.
This was part of a group of techniques used by Impressionists such as impasto, "en plein air", color theory, and thick strokes of oil paint on canvas.
In 2008, the Museum of Modern Art curated a major exhibit of van Gogh's work of "effets de soir".
The exhibit included such iconic paintings as "The Potato Eaters", "The Sower (Van Gogh)", "Starry Night Over the Rhone""The Starry Night", and "The Night Cafe".

"Doctor Wooreddy's Prescription for Enduring the Ending of the World" is an historical novel by Mudrooroo Nyoongah, first published in 1983. Though the protagonist Wooreddy is fictional, the novel deals largely with the real-life George Augustus Robinson, who was sent by Great Britain to Tasmania to act as a conciliator between British settlers and the Tasmanian Aborigines. It also deals with his relationship with "Trugernanna," based on the real-life Trugernanner, the last full-blooded Tasmanian Aborigine. Throughout the narrative the violence of colonisation is documented and explored: "a clear parallel is established between the rape of the Tasmanian Aboriginal women and the metaphorical rape of their land, sacred sites and heritage."

Saint Thomas - Rutherford Hospital

Saint Thomas - Rutherford Hospital, formerly Middle Tennessee Medical Center, is a 286-bed private, not-for-profit hospital located in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, United States. MTMC is a member of Saint Thomas Health Services. A replacement hospital building is under construction, and the hospital expects to move into the new building some time in 2010. A Physicians Medical Office Building is also under construction. The Middle Tennessee Center for Lung Disease has leased space in one of the hospital's new buildings.
The hospital spent more than $30 million in care on uninsured patients in fiscal year 2009.
The New MTMC.
In 2006, MTMC announced plans to build a new 286-bed hospital to replace its 80-year-old facility. Groundbreaking festivities were held in early 2008, followed by a topping out ceremony six months later.
The facility is the focal point of a medical campus. Two patient towers contain 286 all-private patient rooms. Other features include a 32-bed intensive care unit, a emergency department, expanded maternity services, and a surgical suite with 10 operating rooms.
Total cost for the construction project was estimated at $267 million. Completion was originally scheduled for Aug. 2, 2010, with reports in fall 2009 that the project was ahead of schedule and construction wrapping up by June 15, 2010. New patients were admitted starting Oct. 2, 2010.
Saint Thomas Heart.
The cardiology doctor groups of the four hospitals of Saint Thomas Health Services (Saint Thomas Hospital, Baptist Hospital, Middle Tennessee Medical Center and Hickman Community Hospital) combined in 2007 to form Saint Thomas Heart. The group works with clinics and health care facilities throughout Middle Tennessee and Southern Kentucky in more than 20 counties.
In 2008, Thomson Reuters named Saint Thomas Heart to its list of top 100 cardiovascular community hospitals.
Chest Pain Network.
The Saint Thomas Chest Pain Network is a division of Saint Thomas Health Services that coordinates with local emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals to provide cardiac care services. The Chest Pain Network includes 15 hospitals in Tennessee and Kentucky, all accredited by the Society of Chest Pain Centers.
The Saint Thomas Chest Pain Network covers Tennessee and Southern Kentucky. Members of the network include:
Neurosciences Institute.
The Saint Thomas Health Services Neurosciences Institute is among the Nashville area's most comprehensive brain, back, nervous system and spine centers. In 2008, independent health care rating company HealthGrades gave Saint Thomas a five-star rating for back and neck surgery.
Among the ailments and diseases treated through the Neurosciences Institute are epilepsy, stroke, brain tumors, ALS, sleep disorders, spine injuries, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain and Parkinson's disease. In 2012, MTMC opened the area's first Epilepsy Monitoring Unit.
The Saint Thomas Brain & Spine Tumor Center is a collaboration between the Neurosciences Institute and the Dan Rudy Cancer Center. Saint Thomas uses the Novalis Shaped Beam Surgery System, an advanced stereostatic radiotherapy treatment that focuses radiation to the shape of the tumor and results in minimum damage to surrounding tissue. The Saint Thomas Health Services Neurosciences Institute is the only health care center in Tennessee to provide Novalis Shaped Beam Surgery.
Bariatric Program.
The Bariatric Program at MTMC provides a variety of weight loss procedures to assist in the treatment of morbid obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, arthritis, asthma, acid reflux, infertility and high cholesterol.
These bariatric procedures include the Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Band (LAP-BAND) System, Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, Open or Laparoscopic Duodenal Switch and Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy.
Orthopedics.
Middle Tennessee Medical Center provides a number of orthopedic services at its own facility and through its family of Saint Thomas Health Services hospitals. In 2008, the program was ranked in the top 5% in the nation for spine surgery by HealthGrades. Saint Thomas Orthopedics also received five-star ratings for overall orthopedic services, spine surgery, joint replacement, total knee replacement, back and neck surgery, and spinal fusion.
Sports Medicine.
A specialized extension of its orthopedic program, Baptist Sports Medicine combines several services under its umbrella, including general orthopedics, physical therapy, aquatic therapy, athletic medicine and occupational therapy. Baptist Sports Medicine is the exclusive health care provider to the Tennessee Titans, Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association and Lipscomb University.
In 2007, Baptist Sports Medicine managing director Trent Nessler headed a research team to evaluate screening tests and evaluate their predictive value for athletic injury when used as a pre-assessment tool.
Baptist Sports Medicine clinics can be found throughout Middle Tennessee, with locations in downtown Nashville, Antioch, Bellevue, Brentwood, Centerville, Green Hills, Murfreesboro, Pleasant View, Rivergate and Spring Hill, as well as at Lipscomb University.
Life Therapies.
The Life Therapies offers specialized rehabilitation therapy services in a relaxed, non-hospital atmosphere. Because the recovery process can be an emotionally difficult experience, Life Therapies services are located in clinics that are designed as a comfortable environment conducive to healing.
Life Therapies clinics offer services for a variety of stages in a patient's life, including treatment of lymphedema, and neurological, post-stroke, vestibular, pediatric, oncology and women's health issues.
Until January 2009, the Life Therapies services were provided under the umbrella of Baptist Sports Medicine. It was determined that creating the new Life Therapies service line would allow therapists and physicians to better treat patients that don't require traditional sports medicine.
The six clinics are found throughout Middle Tennessee, including locations at Baptist Medical Plaza I in downtown Nashville, Green Hills, Maryland Farms YMCA in Brentwood, Spring Hill and two locations in Murfreesboro.
Center for Pelvic Health.
The Center for Pelvic Health is made up of a multidisciplinary team to diagnose and treat pelvic health disorders, focusing on chronic pain and incontinence. The center touts the use of unique treatments, such as non-surgical interventions (cystoscopy, urodynamics, colposcopy and tibial nerve stimulation), pelvic floor physical therapy (postural and pelvic floor muscle evaluation), and surgical treatment options (diagnostic laparoscopy, awake pain mapping, urethral slings and advanced robotic techniques).
The Center for Pelvic Health is a referral center and works with patients' primary care physicians for treatment.
Women's Health.
The hospitals of Saint Thomas Health Services partner together to provide women's health services that range from gynecology and breast health to pelvic health and birthing services. A level III neonatal intensive care unit can be found at MTMC's sister site, Baptist Hospital.
More than 100 hand-knitted caps were donated to MTMC's birthing center by residents of AdamsPlace, an independent living center in Murfreesboro.
Cancer Program.
The Saint Thomas Health Services Cancer Program uses innovative cancer treatments, integrated therapies and comprehensive education and prevention in the battle against cancer. An American College of Surgeons-accredited program, Saint Thomas Health Services provides treatment and prevention services for a number of forms of cancer, including brain, breast, cervical, colon, lung, ovarian, prostate, uterine and others.
As part of its treatment, the Saint Thomas Health Services Cancer Program partners with world-renowned institutions, including Cleveland Clinic and Tennessee Oncology, to partake in community-based clinical trials in oncology and related therapies. This, along with a network of more than 44 physicians, allows Saint Thomas to identify innovative solutions for advanced patient care and improve outcomes for cancer patients.
In December 2008, Baptist Hospital's cancer program was recognized by the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons as offering the best in cancer care. Baptist Hospital received Three-Year Approval with Commendation from the Commission on Cancer.
Partnership with MTSU.
Middle Tennessee Medical Center is the official healthcare provider for the Middle Tennessee State University athletics program.

ModeMapping

ModeMapping is a research technique developed by Stuart Karten Design (SKD), a Los Angeles, USA, based industrial design firm. It is a method of interpreting standard consumer research to uncover areas of unmet needs. 
It can be understood as a visualization tool that tracks the state of mind of consumers over time. Designers can then look for patterns by using a colorcoding system of categorizing these states of mind, or “modes,” that describe activity (“work mode” or “play mode”). The color-coded patterns of consumer behavior allow designers to look for shared experiences and then use these observations to suggest solutions that will appeal to customers. This also creates a topography of sorts of consumer activities as well as how they are thinking and feeling during those activities.
SKD has used ModeMapping to drive product lines for companies including Johnson Controls and Avery Dennison. For example, for Johnson Controls, SKD found that the drivers they observed all made quick, frequent transitions from role to role (parent at school, friend meeting peers at a restaurant) throughout the day. Seeing this pattern led the designers to suggest products such as a modular storage system that can easily be loaded into a vehicle and a reminder system (using RFID tags) that would alert drivers when important items (say, kids' sports equipment before a game) wasn’t brought into the car.
ModeMapping has won a Silver International Design Excellence Award in 2006.
"BusinessWeek" featured ModeMapping as an “innovation tool worth trying now.”

Nick Piombino

Nick Piombino (born October 5, 1942) is an American poet, essayist, artist and psychotherapist. He has been associated with poets from both the New York School of the 1960s and the Language Poets of the 1970s, though his work is not easily classified
Biography.
Piombino was born in New York City. He received his BA with honors in English from the City College of New York in 1964 and a Masters degree in social work from Fordham University in 1971. He was certified in adult psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in New York in 1982. 
Piombino became an active participant in the thriving poetry scene in New York in the 1960s. He studied poetry in writing workshops with William S. Burroughs at City College in 1965 and at the Poetry Project with New York School poet Ted Berrigan in 1967 and Bernadette Mayer in 1973. Mayer in particular was a major influence on Piombino's writing. Encouraged by Berrigan and Mayer, Piombino gave his first poetry reading with singer-songwriter Patti Smith, at The Kitchen, in 1973.
Piombino's writing is informed by his psychoanalytical training. Finding that "early psychoanalytic theory is breathtakingly poetic,", at the same time that he was discovering poetry and fiction, the two disciplines became irrevocably intertwined in his work. Piombino discusses the relationship at length in his third volume of poetry, "Theoretical Objects", where he states "psychoanalysis and literature are more interrelated than is apparent.
On a year-long trip to Italy and Morocco in 1968, Piombino began to experiment with another art form. Inspired by the "cut-up" techniques that Berrigan and Burroughs used in their writing workshops and the "Merz Pictures" of German artist Kurt Schwitters, he constructed collages using found materials.
Piombino began a private psychotherapy practice in 1976 and has held a number of staff positions as a social worker or psychotherapist in the New York City school system. He became a faculty supervisor at the Psychoanalytic Institute New York Counseling and Guidance Services in 1987. His experience as a practicing psychotherapist his use of psychoanalytical theory have greatly influenced his poetry.
Following the advent of weblogging, Piombino also began to make use the Internet, and began a blog, "fait accompli."
Works.
Poetry.
Piombino's first published poems appeared in 1965 in "American Weave Literary Journal." Throughout the 1970s, he continued to publish in small literary journals, such as "The World", "Dodgems", "Telephone", and "Roof". 
His first volume of poetry, titled simply "Poems", was published by the Sun & Moon Press in 1988 and won an Author's Recognition Award from the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in 1992. His second chapbook, "Light Street", did not appear until 1996. It was followed by "Theoretical Objects" (1999), a collection of manifestos, aphorisms, essays, and seemingly autobiographical prose poems.
Piombino's poetry took a different turn with "Hegelian Honeymoon" (2004), in which he moved away from the conventions of Language poetry to explore more traditional forms. Inspired by the poetry that accompanied an exhibition of Japanese calligraphy, the poems are a cross between haiku and aphorism. The poems were originally published on the SUNY/Buffalo poetics list-serve before being published in chapbook form by Chax Press.
Essays, Manifestos and Aphorism.
Piombino initially made his literary reputation not as a poet, but as a theorist of experimental poetics. Piombino's essays use the discourse of psychoanalysis to discuss the role of memory, history, and narrative in the construction of a style of poetry that strives to be both non-narrative and non-referential. He was a regular contributor to L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, which served as a forum for the Language poetry movement between 1978 and 1982. Charles Bernstein, one of the editors of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, describes Piombino's essays as the poetic heart of the magazine.Language Poets Similarly, poet Ron Silliman describes Piombino's essays on poetics as "one of the journal's most important attributes. Many of these essays have been reprinted in "The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book" (1984) and "The Boundary of Blur" (1993). 
Inspired by the literary journals of writers such as Cesare Pavese and Paul Valéry, Piombino began experimenting with the related forms of the manifesto and the aphorism in the 1980s. He included examples of both forms in "Boundary of Blur" and T"heoretical Objects". Piombino's manifestos were published annually from 1993 to 2003 in the journal "Ribot," edited by poet Paul Vengelisti.
In recent years, Piombino has developed a form of aphorism that he calls "contradicta": paired aphorisms that are both true but nonetheless contradictory. A collection of these aphorisms, with illustrations by Toni Simon, was published by Green Integer Press in 2010 under the title "Contradicta: Aphorisms".
Collages.
After his return from Italy and Morocco, Piombino continued to create collages, which he describes as "visual poetry", inspired by his exposure to the conceptual art movement through the work of Bernadette Mayer, Vito Acconci, and Robert Smithson.
Piombino's earliest collages were created using old magazines and other found materials. In the 1980s he moved from working with found materials to photocollages. In his more recent collages, such as his photocollage "novel" "Free Fall", Piombino has returned to the use of found materials, which he photocopies, then cuts and pastes. Photos of his early collages can be found on his blog, "fait accompli". 
His works were exhibited in group shows at the arts center PS122 in 1980 and 2006, at the Maryann Boesky Gallery in 2001, and at the Harvard Dudley House in 2005. "Free Fall" was exhibited as part of the Analogous Series curated by Tim Peterson in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2005 and was published by Otoliths Press in 2007. Collages from "Free Fall" have subsequently been incorporated into a video of the same name by artist Mike Burakoff.

Emergent grammar

Emergent grammar is a functional approach to the study of syntax, originally proposed by Paul Hopper, which postulates that rules for grammar and syntactic structure emerge as language is used. It is distinguished from what Hopper calls the "A Priori Grammar Postulate", which posits that grammar is a set of rules existing in the mind before the production of utterances. Like other functional theories of grammar it is opposed to the principles of generative grammar and the concept of Universal Grammar. Whereas Universal Grammar claims that features of grammar are innate, emergent grammar and other functional theories claim that the human language faculty has no innate grammar and that features of grammar are learned through experience. Emergent grammar differs from other functionalist frameworks in that it dispenses entirely with the idea of grammar as a synchronic structure, instead seeing grammar as a continuous diachronic process of grammaticalization.
Emergent grammar was formally proposed in 1987. Since then, it has been an approach common in linguistic discourse analysis and conversation analysis and has been used to investigate the relationship between grammatical structure and real-time interaction and language use.

Judge Pursuivant

Judge Keith Hilary Pursuivant is a fictional character and a supporting character in a series of stories by author Manly Wade Wellman. Pursuivant is a retired judge, author, and occult scholar who investigates mysterious supernatural events.
Fictional character biography.
Pursuivant is more a mentor to and helper of characters who have become embroiled in occult adventures than a hero per se. He first appears in the short story "The Hairy Ones Shall Dance," first published in 1938 in the weird-fiction pulp magazine "Weird Tales". Pursuivant is described as a man of great height and girth, with bulbous eyes and nose and a drooping blonde moustache. He lives in a small town five hours from Washington, D.C., and is sufficiently wealthy to be attended by a manservant. He is intelligent and well-read in occult matters. A biography of Pursuivant is presented in the short story "The Black Drama," which presents him as having been born in 1891, retired in 1919, had studied at Yale and Oxford, and was decorated while serving in U.S. intelligence during World War I.
The name Pursuivant may be a reference to the Masonic master-of-arms called a Pursuivant.
Until he passed it on to Wellman's later character, John Thunstone, Judge Pursuivant possessed a sword-cane with a silver blade said to have been forged by Saint Dunstan. The blade is inscribed with a text from Judges chapter 5 in the Vulgate, ""Sic pereant omnes inimici tui"" – "thus perish all your enemies". The sword-cane, which was especially potent against vampires, werewolves and other supernatural creatures, was passed on when Pursuivant's advanced age made him too weak to effectively wield it.
Although referred to in several stories, Judge Pursuivant only actually appeared in four short stories or novellas by Wellman: "The Hairy Ones Shall Dance" (1938), "The Black Drama" (1938), "The Dreadful Rabbits" (1940), and "The Half Haunted" (1941) – all originally published in "Weird Tales" – and as a supporting character in Wellman's 1982 Silver John novel "The Hanging Stones" and the John Thunstone novel "The School of Darkness". All Wellman's Judge Pursuivant short stories have been collected in "Fearful Rock and Other Precarious Locales", Night Shade Books (2001).
Judge Pursuivant also appears as a supporting character in the story "Chastel", not collected in the above volume but in volume one of that series ("Third Cry to Legba and other Invocations"), originally published in "The Year's Best Horror Stories VII" (1979).

Miles Jones (musician)

Miles Jones (born 1983) is a Canadian hip hop/soul musician. Miles founded "Mojo Records and Publishing" in 2004 to provide an outlet for artists, producers and Dj's to produce and publish audio works. Miles career began with a solo album he released in 2006 release which was his University thesis project titled "One Chance". In 2009 he followed up with Hip Hop sophomore album titled, Runaway Jones, which landed placements on CSI Las Vegas, ABC's Rookie Blue and CTV's 2010 Olympic games soundtrack of the nation.
Biography.
It’s a familiar story not only in hip-hop but in business at large, that the most outstanding opportunities are often those we create ourselves. Artistically minded entrepreneurs who are able to balance business and art advantageously in the urban Canadian music industry, however, aren’t exactly of a common breed. But such savvy individuals do exist and tend to stand out from the rest, like Toronto representing triple-threat emcee, producer, and songwriter Miles Jones, who sees prime real estate when he looks out into the vast and unclaimed Canadian hip-hop landscape. 
A whirlwind of endeavors and successes have followed Jones since he founded his own label Mojo Records & Publishing in 2004. Shortly after releasing his debut album One Chance as his graduating University Thesis at McMaster in 2006, he began work on his sophomore album Runaway Jones (2009) and managed to acquire impressive features from hip-hop stars Boi-1da, Black Milk, Percee P, Kae Sun, and Shad K. Along with executive producer and manager Marshall Tully, Jones crafted a classic boom-bap influenced hip-hop sound infused with familiar strains of house that has proved immensely agreeable: Runaway Jones charted #3 on iTunes Canada, and the “Coast to Coast” was picked up by CBS for Las Vegas CSI and CTV for the 2010 Olympics broadcast. Other accolades for Runaway Jones include a 2009 Independent Music Award for “Song of The Year” and a prize for the 2010 Billboard Song Contest.
So, he’s got the reach, but does he have the home-town flavor? Check. Usually sporting a blue-jays cap, Miles has traversed several stages in live settings, moving, bending and hyping engaging crowds for his own performances as well as shows for international acts like Reflection Eternal, Raekwon, KRS-One, Souls of Mischief, K-OS, and T-Pain. Jones’s infectious emcee charisma has probably been shaped by a thing or two he has picked up from his Dad “Hedley Jones Jr., an influential DJ in the early Toronto club scene, but his live performance is something to see because of the on-stage chemistry between he long-time collaborator DJ Serious. More than anything, however, it is Miles Jones’s hard work and perseverance toward broadening his career and craft that makes this well-rounded Toronto artist someone to watch. 
In addition to his activities as a DJ producer, songwriter, emcee, and owner of Mojo Records, Jones is also a contributing affiliate of the creative group and collective, which has produced most of Jones’s unique visuals (photo and video) including the perception warming video for “Trust Me” and the back-alley-rap video for “Never Wrong (Remix)” that accompanied his breakthrough into the U.S. marketplace.
Miles’ multi-talents are invaluable not only because he is emerging on the cusp of the DIY-internet driven market, but more importantly, because they allow him complete artistic control over his music and public image. With a musical past behind him and an industry break-through present, Miles’ bright future is soon to be a part of yours, too.

Nonzero-rule

In two-dimensional computer graphics, the non-zero winding rule is a means of determining whether a given point falls within an enclosed curve. Unlike the similar even-odd rule, it relies on knowing the direction of stroke for each part of the curve.
For a given curve C and a given point P: construct a ray (a straight line) heading out from P in any direction towards infinity. Find all the intersections of C with this ray. Score up the winding number as follows: for every clockwise intersection (the curve passing through the ray from left to right, as viewed from P) subtract 1; for every counter-clockwise intersection (curve passing from right to left, as viewed from P) add 1. If the total winding number is zero, P is outside C; otherwise, it is inside.
The winding number is effectively a count of how many full counter-clockwise revolutions ('windings') the curve makes around P without doubling back on itself. (If P were a nail and C were a looped piece of string, try pulling some part of the string sideways away from the nail: it will either come free, or it will be found to be wound some number of times around the nail.)
Some implementations instead score up the number of clockwise revolutions, so that clockwise crossings are awarded +1, counter-clockwise crossings -1. The result is the same.
One formal definition of the winding number of point P with respect to curve C (where P does not lie on the curve) is as follows:

Dudeism

Dudeism is a philosophy and lifestyle inspired by the modern-day fictional character Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski, as portrayed by Jeff Bridges in the Coen Brothers' 1998 film "The Big Lebowski". Dudeism's stated primary objective is to promote a modern form of Chinese Taoism, outlined in "Tao Te Ching" and Laozi (6th century BC), blended with concepts by the Ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (341-270 BC), and presented in a style as personified by the character of "The Dude". Dudeism has sometimes been regarded as a mock religion, though its founder and many adherents regard it seriously.
Formation.
Founded in 2005 by Oliver Benjamin, a journalist based in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Dudeism's official organizational name is "The Church of the Latter-Day Dude". At least 160,000 "Dudeist Priests" have been ordained as of August 2012.
Although Dudeism primarily makes use of iconography and narrative from "The Big Lebowski", adherents believe that the Dudeist worldview has existed since the beginnings of civilization, primarily to correct societal tendencies towards aggression and excess. They list individuals such as Laozi, Epicurus, Heraclitus, Buddha, and the pre-ecclesiastical Jesus Christ as examples of ancient Dudeist prophets. More recent antecedents include pillars of American Transcendentalism such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman and humanists such as Kurt Vonnegut and Mark Twain.
Philosophy.
The Dudeist belief system is essentially a modernized form of Taoism purged of all of its metaphysical and medical doctrines. Dudeism advocates and encourages the practice of "going with the flow", "being cool headed", and "taking it easy" in the face of life's difficulties, believing that this is the only way to live in harmony with our inner nature and the challenges of interacting with other people. It also aims to assuage feelings of inadequacy that arise in societies which place a heavy emphasis on achievement and personal fortune. Consequently, simple everyday pleasures like bathing, bowling, and hanging out with friends are seen as far preferable to the accumulation of wealth and the spending of money as a means to achieve happiness and spiritual fulfillment.
The Church of the Latter-Day Dude launched its official publication, "The Dudespaper", in the fall of 2008. A Dudeist holy book, "The Tao Dude Ching" went online in July 2009. It was renamed "The Dude De Ching" in December 2009 to avoid being confused with an upcoming book by Oliver Benjamin called "The Tao of the Dude". The Dude De Ching is a reinterpretation of Peter Merel's translation of the "Tao Te Ching" using dialogue and story elements from "The Big Lebowski".
In August 2011, a "Dudeist self-help book" employing life lessons from "The Big Lebowski" and other sources, entitled "The Abide Guide" was published by Ulysses Press. Written by Oliver Benjamin and the Arch Dudeship Dwayne Eutsey, it also contains material by other members of The Church of the Latter-Day Dude. An Italian translation was released in November 2013 under the title "Il vangelo secondo Lebowski"
In November 2013 a compilation of mostly-scholarly essays edited by Benjamin which dissected and celebrated "The Big Lebowski" titled "Lebowski 101" was published by the Church. Over 80 writers and illustrators contributed to the book.
"The Dude and the Zen Master", a 2013 book by Jeff Bridges and Buddhist teacher Bernie Glassman, uses the character as a starting point for philosophical discussion. Asked at a promotional event what The Dude would think of Dudeism, Bridges replied that "He’d be flabbergasted. And he would dig it."

Artemisia spinescens

Artemisia spinescens is a species of sagebrush known by the common name budsage. 
It is often treated separately from genus "Artemisia" and named Picrothamnus desertorum, but this separation has not been confirmed by genetic analysis. 
Distribution.
It is native to the western United States from southern California and the Great Basin, north to Idaho and Montana, and east to western Colorado and northwestern New Mexico.
It grows in scrub and other habitat on clay and gravel-rich soils. It thrives on salty soils, growing with other salt-tolerant plants such as saltbushes ('"Atriplex" sp.). It is adapted to very dry climates. 
Description.
"Artemisia spinescens" is a squat shrub forming a rounded bush up to 30 to 50 centimeters in maximum height. Its tangled branches are woolly when new and thorny and rough when aged. The stem is woody and corky. 
The strongly aromatic foliage is made up of many small, fuzzy leaves divided into narrow, pointed segments. It is deciduous, dropping its leaves during the dry summer when it becomes dormant. 
The inflorescence is a raceme of small clusters of flower heads sprouting from leaf axils. Each head contains several tiny bell-shaped sterile disc florets and a few fertile ray florets. 
The fruit is a tiny hairy achene less than a millimeter long. 
Uses.
This plant is considered good forage for wild and domestic grazing animals early in the season when the foliage is new and soft. Later in the season when the plant produces large quantities of bitter volatile oils it becomes unpalatable.

Terra Amata is an archaeological site near the French town of Nice.
Critical reception.
"Terra Amata "was perceived to center on the "perceptions and activities" of "its protagonist" Chancelade
The work seems to have been "designed to overload the senses"
According to one critic "Chancelade has done nothing, suffered nothing, experienced nothing to make him worth"...regard from that critic. The story is that of Chancelade, from childhood to death; he sees the world in minute detail...""Terra Amata," combines Le Clézio's game-playing as the author with a savage lyricism reminiscent of Thomas Hardy.

Mauritius campaign of 1809–11

The Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811 was a series of amphibious operations and naval actions fought to determine possession of the French Indian Ocean territories of Isle de France and Île Bonaparte during the Napoleonic Wars. The campaign lasted from the spring of 1809 until the spring of 1811, and saw both the Royal Navy and the French Navy deploy substantial frigate squadrons with the intention of disrupting or protecting trade from British India. In a war in which the Royal Navy was almost universally dominant at sea, the campaign is especially notable for the local superiority enjoyed by the French Navy in the autumn of 1810 following the British disaster at the Battle of Grand Port, the most significant defeat for the Royal Navy in the entire conflict.
The Royal Navy had been planning an operation against Isle de France since the capture of the Dutch East Indies in 1806, but was forced to act earlier than expected following the despatch from France of a powerful frigate squadron under Commodore Jacques Hamelin in late 1808. This force was able to capture a number of East Indiamen and disrupt trade routes across the Indian Ocean by raiding the convoys in which the merchant ships travelled. Forced to confront this enemy, Admiral Albemarle Bertie at the Cape of Good Hope ordered Commodore Josias Rowley to blockade the French islands and prevent their use as raiding bases.
For the next two years, the British raided ports and anchorages on the French islands while the French attacked trade convoys in the wider ocean. The British were able to slowly reduce the French presence by eliminating their bases through limited invasions, but suffered a major setback at Grand Port in August 1810 and were forced onto the defensive in the autumn. Hamelin was eventually defeated only after being personally captured on his flagship "Vénus" by Rowley, shortly before substantial reinforcements arrived under Bertie to seize Isle de France. Throughout the campaign Hamelin was unable to secure reinforcement from France—almost all attempts to break through the British blockade of French ports proved futile and only one frigate successfully reached in the Indian Ocean before the surrender of Isle de France. The final such attempt arrived off Mauritius in May 1811, only to discover that the island was in British hands. On the return journey, the force was attacked by a British squadron off Madagascar and defeated, leaving the British in complete control of the Indian Ocean.
Background.
The Indian Ocean was a vital part of the chain of trade links that connected the British Empire. Merchant ships from China, Arabia and East Africa crossed it regularly and at its centre was the British-held continent of India, from which heavily laden East Indiamen brought millions of pounds worth of trade goods to Britain every year. Trade with India was vital to the financial security of Britain and consequently the trade routes across the Indian Ocean were a high priority for protection from the Royal Navy and at serious risk from French raiders. The outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, following the brief Peace of Amiens that had ended the French Revolutionary Wars, placed the Indian Ocean trade routes under threat from Dutch cruisers operating from Cape Town and the Dutch East Indies and French ships based on Isle de France and the newly renamed Île Bonaparte. By 1808, most the Dutch colonies had been neutralised in a series of brief but successful campaigns; the Cape by Sir Home Riggs Popham in January 1806 and the Dutch island of Java by Sir Edward Pellew in a campaign that ended in December 1807. The French Indian Ocean islands were however far more defensible: heavily fortified, garrisoned by regular French soldiers and several months voyage from the nearest British port, they presented a much greater challenge to the limited British forces available in the region.
At the beginning of the war, as in the preceding conflict, French privateers operated from the islands, including a fleet of small vessels run by Robert Surcouf. Supplementing these ships were occasional French naval vessels, principally the frigate "Piémontaise" (captured in March 1808) and the old frigates "Sémillante" and "Cannonière". These ships operated independently of one another and achieved minor successes against smaller British warships and merchant vessels but were not powerful enough to have a serious effect on the Indian Ocean trade routes. In August 1808, "Sémillante" and "Cannonière" were downgraded to armed storeships and sent back to France. To replace these ships, four large frigates under Jacques Hamelin were sent to Governor Charles Decaen on Isle de France in the late autumn of 1808. These vessels, "Vénus", "Manche", "Caroline" and "Bellone" were large and powerful ships under orders to operate from Isle de France and Île Bonaparte against British trade in the Indian Ocean. Based on Isle de France, these frigates had access to large numbers of unemployed sailors and several fortified anchorages from which to launch raids on the British trade routes. A fifth frigate, "Niémen", was to have joined the force in the summer of 1809, but was intercepted and captured within hours of leaving France at the Action of 6 April 1809.
To counteract the French deployment to the region, a small British force was organised by Vice-Admiral Albemarle Bertie at Cape Town under the command of Commodore Josias Rowley, with orders to blockade Isle de France and Île Bonaparte and seize or destroy any French ships that operated from the islands. To perform this task, Rowley was given the old ship of the line HMS "Raisonnable", the fourth rate HMS "Leopard", frigates HMS "Nereide", HMS "Sirius" and HMS "Boadicea" and a number of smaller ships. Both the British and the French squadrons reached the Indian Ocean in the spring of 1809.
First exchanges.
Hamelin's forces were immediately effective: "Caroline" attacked a westbound convoy of East Indiamen in the Action of 31 May 1809 in the Bay of Bengal and captured two, the "Streatham" and "Europe". She seized several other small vessels on the cruise before slipping back to Île Bonaparte with her prizes in August. Hamelin too cruised in the Bay of Bengal during the summer and autumn, "Vénus" accompanied by "Manche" and the corvette "Créole". On 26 July, "Vénus" captured the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) warship "Orient" off the Nicobar Islands.
Rowley's force had also been active: "Nereide" under Captain Robert Corbet captured a number of small vessels off Port Napoleon in the late spring, including the brig "Aigle", which he sent to the Cape of Good Hope with a prize crew that mutinied, killed their officer and took the ship to Île Bonaparte. The brig HMS "Otter", under Captain Nesbit Willoughby, raided an anchorage at Rivière Noire District on 14 August, capturing a coastal vessel (which he later had to abandon) under heavy fire. Willoughby also recaptured "Aigle" shortly afterwards. Rowley himself had chased the "Bellone" in "Raisonnable" as the French ship emerged from Port Napoleon on 17 August, but had been unable to catch her. Most significant of all was the seizure of the island of Rodriguez by a British Army force from India under Lieutenant Colonel Henry Keating. This small island was close enough to Isle de France to provide an effective base for the British blockade squadron and a staging area for a future invasion of the French islands.
Rowley's first co-ordinated action was prompted by the return of "Caroline" with her prizes. Sheltering under the guns of Saint-Paul harbour, "Caroline" made an inviting target for an expeditionary force from Rodriguez in practice for the anticipated invasion of the whole island. On 21 September, a force of over 600 soldiers, sailors and Royal Marines under Keating and Willoughby landed on Île Bonaparte and marched around the town's seaward fortifications, storming them from the rear at first light. Capturing each in succession and routing opposition from French militia, the force secured the gun batteries overlooking the port, allowing Rowley to bring his squadron directly into the harbour and bombard the shipping anchored within. The French naval officers, outnumbered and unsupported, drove their ships on shore and abandoned them, allowing the British to seize and carry off "Caroline", the two captured East Indiamen and a number of smaller vessels. French attempts to recapture the town were undermined by the failure of the island's commander, General Nicolas Des Bruslys, to engage the British with his main force. Des Bruslys later committed suicide. With the garrison leaderless, a truce was agreed that granted the British five days in control of the town. In this time they were able to remove all government supplies and demolish the town's government buildings. Rowley and his force eventually departed from Saint-Paul on 28 September. As a reward for their services, Willoughby was promoted to command "Nereide" and Corbet sent back to Britain in "Caroline", renamed HMS "Bourbonaise".
While Rowley was attacking Saint-Paul, Hamelin and his ships "Vénus", "Manche", "Bellone" and "Créole" were cruising in the Bay of Bengal. On 10 October, Hamelin attacked the Honourable East India Company's base at Tappanooly on Sumatra and burnt it to the ground: the entire population was taken prisoner, although the women were sent to Padang in a small schooner. On 2 November, the British brig HMS "Victor" was captured by "Bellone" after a running fight and two weeks later Hamelin intercepted a convoy of three East Indiamen, "Windham", "Streatham" and "Charlton", capturing all three in the Action of 18 November 1809. On 22 November, "Bellone" chased, caught and defeated the 52-gun Portuguese frigate "Minerva". With their crews now dispersed among their prizes and cyclone season rapidly approaching, Hamelin ordered his squadron back to Isle de France. En route, the convoy was struck by a storm and scattered: "Vénus" was especially badly damaged and at one point was only saved from sinking by the efforts of the English prisoners aboard. By 31 December, all ships had returned to Isle de France except "Windham", which had been recaptured by the recently arrived British frigate HMS "Magicienne".
Invasion of Île Bonaparte.
Although the French Navy considered 1809 to have been a success, they reinforced Hamelin with only one frigate, the "Astrée", which arrived early in 1810. Hamelin was quick to act at the end of the cyclone season: Captain Guy-Victor Duperré in "Bellone" and Captain Pierre Bouvet in the ex-Portuguese "Minerva" (renamed "Minerve") departed Isle de France on 14 March to raid in the Bay of Bengal and subsequently along the South-East coast of Africa. Despite an initial lack of targets, Duperré's cruise was successful: in July he discovered and defeated a convoy of East Indiamen at the Action of 3 July 1810, seizing "Windham" for a second time and "Ceylon".
Shortly after Duperré's departure, a British squadron under Captain Henry Lambert consisting of HMS "Magicienne", HMS "Iphigenia" and HMS "Leopard" arrived off Isle de France to restore the blockade. Rowley subsequently increased Lambert's forces, detaching Willoughby in "Nereide" with instructions to raid coastal anchorages on the island. On 24 April, Willoughby sighted the recently arrived "Astrée", and on 30 April attacked the protected anchorage at Jacolet. His target was a large French merchant ship protected by two batteries and a detachment of regular infantry. Landing at night under heavy fire, Willoughby's men seized one battery, drove off a French attack on their beachhead and captured the second battery despite having to advance across a river, under fire, in broad daylight. On returning to their boats, Willoughby's men were attacked by a second French force which they also routed and drove more than a mile inland. Shortly afterwards however, Willoughby was seriously wounded when a musket he was firing exploded, shattering his jaw. As a result, he was forced to spend several months recovering from his injuries on Rodriguez.
During the late spring, Rowley's force was shorn of "Raisonnable" and "Leopard", sent back to Britain for refit. Although reduced to five frigates and a few smaller vessels, Rowley began preparations for the invasion of Île Bonaparte by increasing the number of soldiers available on Rodriguez with detachments sent from Madras. Bonaparte was the smaller of the French bases and was more weakly defended, the island's defences damaged in the raid at Saint Paul the previous year. On 24 June, Rowley withdrew "Boadicea" and "Nereide" to Rodriguez and collected Keating's force of over 3,000 soldiers. Meeting the rest of his squadron off Bonaparte, Rowley organised two landings on 7 July, either side of the island's capital Saint Denis. Advancing rapidly against weak French defences, the British landing parties forced the island's governor Chrysostôme de Sainte-Suzanne to surrender the following day. It was in the days after this operation that Commander Matthew Flinders, an explorer who had been arrested by Decaen at Port Napoleon eight years earlier and held prisoner despite instructions from Napoleon himself to release him, was freed. Flinders was able to supply Rowley and later Bertie with detailed information about the defences on Isle de France.
Battle of Grand Port.
Even before the French garrison on Île Bonaparte had surrendered, Rowley had turned his attention eastwards to Isle de France. The British commander had decided that the best way to eliminate the threat of Hamelin's squadron was to blockade the island's principal ports by seizing the coral islands that marked the entrances to the harbours through the complicated coral reefs that surrounded Isle de France. These islands were fortified, and once in British hands could prevent French ships leaving or entering the harbours, effectively containing Hamelin's ships until Rowley was ready to launch an invasion. Detailed to lead this campaign was Captain Samuel Pym in "Sirius" and Willoughby in "Nereide", with instructions to begin by seizing Île de la Passe at the entrance to the harbour of Grand Port on the south-eastern coast of Isle de France.
Willoughby stormed Île de la Passe on 13 August and captured it, blocking the entrance to Grand Port. With the harbour secure, Willoughby raided along the coastline while Pym, reinforced by Henry Lambert in "Iphigenia" and Lucius Curtis in "Magicienne", blockaded Port Napoleon. On 20 August, sails were spotted approaching Grand Port and Willoughby determined to trick the approaching ships into entering the channel under Île de la Passe, where he could attack and capture them. The squadron was Duperré's squadron returning from the African coast with their prizes and, despite misgivings from Captain Bouvet, Duperré was determined to enter Grand Port and reassured by recognition signals flown by Willoughby, who had captured the French codes on Île de la Passe. As the French passed the fort, Willoughby sprang his trap and opened fire, but a false French tricolour flying from Île de la Passe accidentally ignited as it was lowered. The fire spread to a ready magazine in the fort, which exploded, causing severe damage and casualties. In the confusion all but one of Duperré's ships successfully entered the harbour.
Willoughby appealed to Pym for assistance and Pym brought "Sirius", "Iphigenia" and "Magicienne" to support "Nereide", launching an assault on Grand Port on 23 August. Pym had failed to properly reconnoitre the channel and Duperré had had the warning buoys removed, so that Pym's squadron was blindly sailing into a complicated system of reefs and channels. "Sirius" and "Magicienne" were soon irretrievably grounded while "Iphigenia" struggled to find a passage and was unable to close with the French squadron. Only "Nereide" reached Duperré's line and Willoughby's initial attack was so determined that the entire French squadron was rapidly driven ashore, only "Bellone" remaining in a position to exchange fire with the British frigate. A fortunate shot from "Bellone" cut "Nereide"'s anchor cable and the British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to the French ships which raked her repeatedly. Willoughby managed to mitigate some of the effects by cutting the other anchor cable, which brought some of his guns within range of the French, but the balance of the battle had shifted. Over the next few hours his frigate was battered from the French ships and from guns ashore until she was a dismasted, battered hulk with over 220 of her crew killed or wounded.
"Nereide" surrendered on the morning of 24 August and over the next three days "Magicienne" and "Sirius" were abandoned and burnt to prevent their seizure by the French. On the morning of 28 August, "Iphigenia", laden with survivors from the grounded frigates, was confronted by Hamelin and his main squadron, which had taken seven days to travel from Port Napoleon. Hugely outnumbered, Lambert had no choice but to surrender, ending the worst British naval defeat of the entire war. Rowley arrived in "Boadicea" on 29 August but was unable to influence the outcome of the battle and was chased back to Saint Denis by Hamelin on "Vénus". On the defensive, Rowley sent messages to Rodriguez, Madras and the Cape of Good Hope requesting urgent reinforcements as Bouvet began a blockade of Île Bourbon in the hope of trapping "Boadicea".
On 11 September the frigate HMS "Africaine" arrived from Rodriguez, commanded by Captain Robert Corbet who had served in the raid on Saint Paul in 1809. Corbet was a deeply unpopular commander and when his frigate was attacked and captured by Bouvet's frigates at the Action of 13 September 1810, rumours spread that his death was the result or suicide or even murder. Rowley was able to recapture "Africaine" the following day, but the danger that Hamelin's ships posed to British frigates sailing independently was further emphasised at the Action of 18 September 1810, when HMS "Ceylon" was captured by Hamelin's flagship "Vénus". Again, Rowley was able to recapture the British frigate and on this occasion the damage done to "Vénus" was so severe that she was unable to outrun "Boadicea" and she too was captured, with Hamelin on board.
Capture of Isle de France.
In September, October and November 1810, British forces arrived from Madras, Bombay and the Cape of Good Hope, warships joining Rowley's squadron off Isle de France and soldiers gathering at Rodriguez. The build up of forces was prompted by the defeat at Grand Port combined with the heavy losses of East Indiamen during 1809 and 1810; the British authorities were determined to end the threat posed by the French squadron on Isle de France before the hurricane season made travel in the region too dangerous. In fact, the threat from Isle de France was already substantially reduced: the damage suffered by the French frigates in the engagements at Grand Port and during September could not be repaired with the available naval supplies on Isle de France. In addition, food supplies were running low due to the large number of British prisoners on the island and morale had collapsed in the aftermath of Hamelin's defeat.
By late November 1810, the invasion force was assembled and Vice-Admiral Albemarle Bertie assumed command at Rodriguez. Upon consultation with his commanders, Bertie decided to land at Grand Baie to the north of the island's capital. The landing itself would be commanded by Captain Philip Beaver in HMS "Nisus" and the first troops ashore would be a specially selected vanguard under Keating and a naval brigade under Captain William Augustus Montagu. These forces would advance on Port Napoleon with subsequent reinforcement by the main force under General John Abercromby over the following days. This force, nearly 7,000 in number, was significantly larger than the reliable troops available to Decaen, which numbered approximately 1,300, and were intended to achieve a quick resolution to the campaign before the hurricane season began in December.
Sailing from Rodriguez on 22 November, the 70 vessels of the invasion fleet reached Grand Baie on 29 November. The French made no attempt to resist the landing either at sea or on land and Keating was able to rapidly advance on the capital, hastily mobilised militia units falling back before the British advance. On 30 November, Keating crossed the Rivière du Tombeau after the militia garrison withdrew and in the evening his forward units were skirmishing with Decaen's garrison of Port Napoleon a few miles from the capital. The following morning, Decaen's field commander, Edmé-Martin Vandermaesen made a stand, forming a line on a rise outside the town that blocked Keating's advance. Engaging the centre, Keating used his superior numbers to outflank and defeat the French garrison and Port Napoleon fell. A ceasefire was agreed on 2 December and the following day Decaen surrendered, although he and his men were repatriated to France with their standards and personal weapons.
End of the campaign.
The fall of Isle de France marked the end of the active British campaign and saw six frigates and over 200 cannon fall into British hands, in addition to the island itself, which was returned to its original Dutch name of Mauritius. The island remained under British control until granted independence in 1968. The British forces in the region were scaled back, command passing to Beaver, who sent ships to eliminate French ports on Madagascar and in the Seychelles. Due to the length of time it took for communications to travel between the Indian Ocean and Europe however, the French government were still unaware of the fall of the island in February 1811, when a squadron of reinforcements under François Roquebert, with the supplies needed to repair Hamelin's squadron, was despatched to the Indian Ocean. The squadron arrived on 6 May and was almost brought to battle by a British force off Grand Port, before escaping into the western Indian Ocean. Stopping at Tamatave on Madagascar, the French squadron was caught by a British force under Captain Charles Marsh Schomberg on 20 May and defeated. The Battle of Tamatave was characterised by very light winds, which left the combatants becalmed for much of the day, engaging in periodic fighting as the breeze increased.
Two French frigates were lost at Tamatave, taking the number of frigates lost by the French Navy during the campaign to ten. The defeat marked the end of the campaign and the end of French hopes of seriously disrupting British trade with India: the only remaining safe harbours in the region were a few Dutch colonies on Java, which became the next target of the Royal Navy forces in the region. The Mauritius campaign also had an effect on British post-war strategy in the Indian Ocean, demonstrated by the retention of Mauritius as a colony (although Bourbon was returned to France in 1814 after Napoleon's abdication). With strategic bases placed along their trade routes, British convoys were assured a greater degree of safety and the Royal Navy provided with the infrastructure to operate worldwide.
Culturally, the campaign captured the public imagination in Britain and France: the Battle of Grand Port is the only naval battle that appears on the Arc de Triomphe, while in Britain Rowley and Bertie were both made baronets for their services in the Indian Ocean. The campaign has been studied extensively, both by naval historians such as William James and William Laird Clowes and popular writers, such as Alexandre Dumas, who features the campaign from a French perspective in his 1843 novel "Georges", and Patrick O'Brian, whose 1977 novel "The Mauritius Command" closely follows the British campaign with Rowley replaced by the fictional Jack Aubrey.

Viva Machine

Viva Machine were a Welsh Rock band who started out in 2003 under the name "Ipsofacto" before changing their name and reinventing themselves in 2006 under the name Viva Machine, and later in 2008 adding a second guitarist and synth player Justin Hendy. The band announced a hiatus in September 2009.
History.
Formation, début release (2003-2007).
The band released their first single "My Jet Set Radio" on 4 December 2006, which whilst limitedly available, gained a small amount of radio play through BBC Radio 1, as well as being exposed through ITV show "The Guest List" where the band performed "My Jet Set Radio", "Robot Bodyrox" and "Earthquakers and Love Shakers".
Working with Future Of The Left and Duffy producer Richard Jackson the band worked throughout 2007 on tracks for their debut, recording 15 tracks for the album, and then working on around 20 b-sides. The band finished much of their album in mid-2008 and have since recorded further tracks for inclusion. Rough versions of some tracks that are believed to be on the album have appeared on the band's myspace page, including "Death Star Trucker", "Oxygen", "Futuristic Dracula", "Yo Ho" and "Robot Bodyrox".
The band announced on that "Robotbodyrox" would be the first single from the band's album, the single will be available from 9 November 2008, along with track "Go! Go! Go!", the single will be limitedly available on vinyl at the band's shows. music video premièred also online on 21 October 2008. Due to troubles with the band's distributor the release of "Robotbodyrox" has been pushed back to December 2008 on iTunes and 7digital, however the band made tracks "Delirious" and "Mercenaries" available to download for free via myspace. "Robotbodyrox" became available on iTunes on 27 November 2008, with the full release via Rocklouder Record coming on 9 December.
Debut album, lineup change and hiatus.
In September 2008 the band announced the addition of Justin Hendy, stating on the band's myspace ""we have one added member. He goes by the name of JUSTIN HENDY. Why? 'cause we can thats why. He makes our sound twice as massive, adds live guitars n' keyboards, freeing Chris up to fling himself off the stage"".
The band's debut album, "Viva Machine", was released on 15 June 2009 by Rocklouder Records after they took a break from live shows so bassist Tom could finish his degree. They have also begun working on new material to perform live, which may eventually appear on a second album. The band released the track "Earthquakers & Loveshakers" as a free download on 8 June to promote the album's release.
In September 2009 the band announced that they would be going on a lengthy – and very possibly indefinite – hiatus. The band cited financial and educational commitments as the reasons behind the hiatus.
Style and Influences.
In an interview with Rocklouder bassist Tom Stephens described the band's style, saying "I think the album is a pretty good reflection of the last year of our lives and all the song titles are part of that’s happened to us", going onto say "I think we can write about what a lot of other people would write about, but we try to wrap it a different way. So many bands write literal lyrics that mean exactly what they say, whereas on something like ‘A Futuristic Dracula’ you wouldn’t really know what it’s about until you read it and work it out for yourself.". The band draw their influences from such bands as Clutch, Queens Of The Stone Age, Weezer, Jarcrew, Biffy Clyro, Radiohead and The Beach Boys.
Band members.
During the band's song "Here Comes The Speed of Light" Tom formerly played synth whilst Chris plays bass guitar prior to the addition of Justin Hendy, who now plays keyboards, whist Tom and Chris stick to their regular positions on bass and vocals respectively

<doc id="19807709" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19807709" title="Gresham Castle">
Gresham Castle

Gresham Castle is located south of the village of Gresham in the north of the English county of Norfolk. The medieval castle was actually a fortified manor house.
Permission by license to crenellate his manor house was gained by Sir Edmund Bacon in 1318. Gresham was one of a group of late castles to be fortified or built along the east coast that include Baconsthorpe, Caister, Claxton and Mettingham Castle in Suffolk.
Description.
The castle is situated in a green field site close to the village. It is rectangular in shape with a bulbous protrusion at the north-west corner. A moat surrounding the site is twelve to fifteen feet wide at points and still contains water which can restrict access to the site. The waters of the moat were once supplied from Gur Beck which now has been re-directed and runs approximately 50 meters adjacent to the remains of the castle. The central platform is approximately 2378 square meters (2844 square yards) in area, with round towers 35 feet in diameter. It is very overgrown with trees, bushes and brambles, making an overview of the castle very difficult. The tower that stood at the south-east angle is forward of the platform line. The revetments of the two corner towers on the west elevation can be seen, of which one is much larger than the other. Between them part of the curtain wall still stands to about six feet. The footprint of the site indicates that there were towers on the east side as well, with the one at the north west angle being the size of a keep. Large timbers, presumed to be what remained of a drawbridge, an entrance to a passage, and the keel of a boat were discovered when the surrounding moat was cleaned out in 1846.
History.
In 1427 the castle and manor of Gresham was purchased by the lawyer William Paston to add to his already large property holdings in Norfolk. Paston purchased the castle and manor from Thomas Chaucer of Ewelme and Sir William Moleyns, who each owned half of the property. However, the legality of the purchase was challenged by the Wiltshire peer, Robert Hungerford, Lord Moleyns, 2nd Baron Hungerford. Consequently when William Paston died he left a large and valuable inheritance including Gresham Castle to his son John Paston. Lord Moleyns' longstanding claim to half of the property was encouraged by John Paston’s bitter rival John Haydon of nearby Baconsthorpe Castle. On 17 February 1448 forces led by Lord Moleyns took direct action and entered the fortified manor house and began to collect rent from the tenants of the manor. After these actions, John Paston petitioned the king, and after his appeals Paston reclaimed his property on 6 October. On 28 January, Moleyns with a force of a one thousand men made up of some locals and retainers from Wiltshire, occupied the castle once more this time forcible evicting John Paston’s wife Margaret and twelve of her servants. A lieutenant of Moleyns by the name of Partridge was left to barricade the castle against any attempt by Paston to reclaim his property. In the Paston Letters Margaret explains to her husband John In 1471 Sir John Gresham contemplated the rebuilding of Gresham Castle and sent his brother, also, strangely, called John, to survey the site and draw up plans for a rebuilding. In the event no rebuilding was carried out and the site was abandoned.

Savings and Investment Bank

Savings & Investment Bank (SIB) was a bank licensed in the Isle of Man. It collapsed in 1982 with liabilities of some £37 million. An approximate statement of affairs prepared for a creditors' meeting disclosed loans and advances over £40 million. In a statement to Tynwald Court the Chairman of the Finance Board said that after meeting the auditors and the directors of the Bank, it was obvious that SIB had made very large loans to a relatively small group of companies, beyond banking guidelines, and these were probably irrecoverable. Liquidation commenced 29 July 1982.
Claims from 3,000 depositors and other creditors totalling £31.4 million were admitted in the liquidation but recoveries from loans and advances totalled only £12.8 million. The eventual dividend was 33p in the pound. The Isle of Man Government made additional "ex gratia" payments of 50p in the pound to certain depositors on the first £10,000 of their deposits. Some depositors participated directly in the settlement of claims against SIB's auditors.
Following the collapse, the Lieutenant Governor commissioned an examination of banking supervision in the Isle of Man by officials seconded from the Bank of England. Responding to criticisms and recommendations contained in their report, the Financial Supervision Commission was established in 1983, and the Insurance Authority (later the Insurance and Pensions Authority) in 1986.
A further outcome of the SIB collapse was the introduction of a scheme to protect depositors with Isle of Man Banks, funded by a levy on participating operations - the Depositors' Compensation Scheme contained in the Banking Business (Compensation of Depositors) Regulations 1991.

Heli Modified, Inc. is a privately owned company producing motorcycle handlebar adapters. The company was established by Harry Eddy in 1978 and is headquartered in Cornish, Maine. Heli Modified was incorporated in 1993.
Heli Modified began as a specialty welding shop in the greater Boston area. The company name is derived from heli- arc welding - a type of welding using a tungsten electrode and helium as a shielding gas. Throughout the 1980s, Harry Eddy created custom ergonomic applications for motorcycles. Some of his early designs included replacement swingarms for BMWs, off road modifications and adapting a Harley-Davidson with hand controls for a motorcyclist with an amputated leg.

Crawford v. Nashville

Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville, , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court unanimously ruled that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects an employee who opposes unlawful sexual harassment, but does not report the harassment him or herself.
Background.
The petitioner, Vicky Crawford, was a long-time worker for the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County. In 2002, the department of human resources began an investigation into Dr. Gene Hughes, the newly hired employee relations director for the Metro School District. Several female employees had expressed concern about being sexually harassed by Hughes. Veronica Frazier, the assistant director for the county human resources department was assigned to investigate the allegations.
Frazier began by calling employees who had worked closely with Hughes, including Crawford. Crawford described to Frazier several incidents of sexual harassment.
According to Crawford, Hughes has requested on "numerous" occasions to see her breasts. Hughes also, in response to the question "What's up?" grabbed his crotch and replied "You know what's up." On several occasions, Crawford continued, Hughes had pressed his crotch against the window of her office. On one occasion, when Crawford asked Hughes what she could do for him, he grabbed her head and pulled it towards his crotch. Other allegations were made by two other women who worked with Hughes.
Frazier's report did not resolve the allegations, as Hughes denied the allegations and there were no witnesses. The report concluded that Hughes had acted inappropriately, but no disciplinary action was taken against him. (In fact even after information surfaced in March 2003 that he had made false statements on his resume, claiming untruthfully that he was an attorney, a professional football player with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and a Navy SEAL, Hughes was merely demoted from his $91,250 position to a $75,857 position, and then moved to the athletics department and given a $6,500 pay raise. Hughes resigned in August 2003 but was allowed to collect pay at home through October 2003.)
However, all three of the witnesses who had offered evidence of sexual harassment, including Crawford, were dismissed. Crawford had been employed by the district for over 30 years. Crawford had expressed reluctance to report the incidences earlier because Hughes headed the department, employee relations, where charges are reported. Hughes was tasked with investigating claims of sexual harassment. Hughes was also, Crawford noted, a good friend of the Director of the School District Pedro Garcia, and Crawford was worried that this would result in her losing her job. The Metro school board in January 2008 voted unanimously to end Garcia's tenure due to poor performance.
Following her termination, Crawford sued her former employer under Title VII, which protects employees who oppose unlawful employment actions from employment retaliation. The District Court concluded, and the Sixth Circuit Court affirmed, that Crawford was not protected by Title VII on two grounds. First, her statements to Frazier did not constitute "opposition" to illegal conduct, as Crawford did not initiate the investigation. Second, the court held that Crawford was not protected against retaliation because the investigation was an employer's internal investigation and a charge had not been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Crawford only filed with the EEOC after she had been terminated, as required by Title VII.
Crawford appealed to the Supreme Court, who heard the case on October 8, 2008. The court ruled unanimously in her favor on January 26, 2009.
Decision.
Writing for the majority, Justice Souter defines two activities Title VII protects, saying section 704(a) "makes it unlawful 'for an employer to discriminate against any... employe' who (1) 'has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter' (opposition clause), or (2) 'has made a charge, testified, assisted, or
participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter' (participation clause)." The Sixth Circuit held, when it heard the case, that the opposition clause demanded "active, consistent" opposing, which it did not find Crawford had done, as she did not initiate her own complaint before to the investigation. It also held that since the internal investigation was not conducted pursuant to a charge pending with the EEOC, Crawford was not protected by the participation clause.
The court found that "oppose" is not defined by the statute, so a normal definition of it may be used, per "Perrin v. United States". "Thus, a person can 'oppose' by responding to someone else’s questions just as surely as by provoking the discussion," further "we would call it 'opposition' if an employee took a stand against an employer’s discriminatory practices not by 'instigating' action, but by standing pat, say, by refusing to follow a supervisor’s order to fire a junior worker for discriminatory reasons." The court supposes there could be a hypothetical case in which an employee describes a "supervisor's racist joke as hilarious," but finds that these "will be eccentric cases, and this is not one of them."
It rejects Metro's argument that "employers will be less likely to raise questions about possible discrimination if a retaliation charge is easy to raise" because "mployers... have a strong inducement to ferret out... discriminatory activity." This is because cases such as "Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth" and "Faragher v. Boca Raton" hold employers "vicariously liable" for actionable hostile working environments created by supervisors. (Such as Hughes "sexually obnoxious behavior.") Further, studies show that Ellerth and Faragher prompted employers to "adopt or strengthen procedures for investigating, preventing, and correcting discriminatory conduct." From the employees' perspective, agreeing with Nashville and the Sixth Circuit would mean the prudent employee may decide not answer questions regarding discrimination, as there would be no protection against retaliation. If employees choose not to participate in internal investigations, the employer would have a defense, should a Title VII lawsuit be filed, as Ellerth requires employees to reasonably "take advantage of... preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer," a situation described by the court as a "catch-22." The court, then, decided not to overturn the Ellerth-Faragher scheme. Having ruled on the "opposition" question, the court chose not to address the "participation" question.
Justice Alito wrote a concurrence joined by Justice Thomas, in which he agrees with the Court's primary reasoning, but separately emphasizes that, he believes, the Court's holding "does not and should not extend beyond employees who testify in internal investigations or engage in analogous purposive conduct." Alito disagrees with the Sixth Circuit that "opposition" must be consistent and initiated by the employee, but writes that the opposition must be "active and purposive." Alito finds the majority's definition of oppose could also "embrace silent opposition," and it is questionable whether that is protected. He worries that an "interpretation of the opposition clause that protects conduct that is not active and purposive" would "open the door to retaliation claims by employees who never expressed a word of opposition to their employers." As a hypothetical, he asks if an employee would be protected in a case where the opposition was expressed in an informal "water cooler" chat. A fired employee could claim that the termination was retaliatory if the employers became aware of the views the employee had expressed. He notes that EEOC retaliation charges doubled between 1992 and 2007 and fears that an "expansive interpretation of protected opposition conduct would likely cause this trend to accelerate."
While that is not the question of this case, Alito finds the answer "far from clear." For "present purposes," however, "it is enough to hold that the opposition clause does protect an employee" like Crawford.

Wadjmose

Wadjmose was an ancient Egyptian prince of the 18th dynasty; a son of Pharaoh Thutmose I.
He is likely to have been born a few years before his father ascended the throne. He had a brother named Amenmose; it is disputed who their mother was. If they were born to Queen Ahmose, they were full brothers of Hatshepsut and Neferubity. On the other hand Wadjmose may have been the son of Queen Mutnofret and thus a full brother of Thutmose II. 
Wadjmose is depicted in the El-Kab tomb of himself and Amenmose's tutor , as sitting on Paheri's lap. He is thought to have predeceased his father. Wadjmose and another prince named Ramose were mentioned in the Theban funerary chapel of Thutmose I where Queen Mutnofret is also included. This chapel may have been erected during the reign of Thutmose II between the places where later the mortuary temple of Thutmose IV and the Ramesseum were built. A statue of Mutnofret was found here, making it likely that she was his mother. 
Wadjmose's name occurs written in a cartouche, which is quite rare for princes.

3-MCPD

3-MCPD or (3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol or 3-chloropropane-1,2-diol) is an organic chemical compound which is carcinogenic and highly suspected to be genotoxic in humans, has male anti-fertility effects, and is a chemical byproduct which may be formed in foods, the most commonly found member of chemical contaminants known as chloropropanols.
It is primarily created in foods by protein hydrolysis by adding hydrochloric acid to speed up the reaction of the (soy) protein with lipids at high temperatures. Another method 3-MCPD can also occur in foods which have been in contact with materials containing epichlorohydrin-based wet-strength resins - used in the production of some tea bags and sausage casings.
It has been found in some East Asian and Southeast Asian sauces such as oyster sauce, Hoisin sauce and soy sauce. Using hydrochloric acid rather than traditional slow fermentation is a far cheaper and faster method but unavoidably creates carcinogens.
Absorption and toxicity.
3-MCPD is considered to be carcinogenic to rodents via a non-genotoxic mechanism. It is able to cross the blood-testis barrier and blood–brain barrier. The oral of 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol was reported to be 152 mg/kg bodyweight in rats.
3-MCPD also has male antifertility effects and can be used as a rat chemosterilant.
Legal limits.
The joint Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) set a limit for 3-MCPD in soy sauce of 0.02 milligrams per kilogram, in line with European Commission standards which came into force in the EU in April 2002.
Incidents.
A survey of soy sauces and similar products available in the UK was carried out by the Joint Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food/Department of Health Food Safety and Standards Group (JFSSG) in 2000 and reported more than half of the samples collected from retail outlets contained various levels of 3-MCPD.
Current status.
These companies continue to use the rapid soy protein hydrolyzation method, but modify methods to lower contaminants to meet standards. Hydrolyzing always produces some 3-MCPD, but for 1,3-DCP, a byproduct of 3-MCPD, there is no standard to meet as it is unregulated, although, according to research, it is also can cause cancer and mutations.

The Einstein Medical Center is a tertiary care teaching hospital in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area of the United States. An important aspect of the medical center is that of educating graduating physicians. The medical center offers residency and fellowship training programs in many specialized areas. It also includes a Level I Regional Resource Trauma Center and a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
Founded as the Jewish Hospital for the Aged, Infirmed and Destitute in August, 1864, this hospital was an important institution in the history of the Jews in Philadelphia, providing care for "the suffering poor of all religions". It officially opened in 1866, starting with 22 beds (the linens donated by philanthropist Moses Rosenbach) at 56th and Haverford Road in West Philadelphia. The hospital soon expanded, moving to Old York Road in 1873, and opening various homes and clinics. In 1952, the Jewish hospital merged with Northern Liberties Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital to form a single medical center. It was named for Albert Einstein after the volunteer president of Mount Sinai wrote a letter asking Einstein for permission to use his name. Einstein granted his permission on June 28 of that year.

List of French marquisates

The following page contains an incomplete list (A-Z) of marquisates (French "marquisat") that currently, or once did, exist within France or within its conquered provinces. They were created by the kings of France and Spain, the dukes of Savoie and Lorraine, the popes in Comtat Venaissin, and other sovereign lords in the current day Republic of France.
From the late Middle Ages until the French revolution, marquisates were mainly raised by Letters patent (in French lettres patentes). In a few cases, other official acts, such as brevet royal, were used to create marquisates. These marquisates were given to members of princely houses or to distinguished nobles as rewards.
Currently, there does not exist a complete list of marquisates (or other marquess titles, which are not covered in this list), in part, because their creations were numerous, especially during the reigns of Louis XIV and XV.
This list also contains "marquisates of usage", which, in reality, "might" only be hereditary courtesy titles, or "might" be true, raised marquisates. Due to the loss of proven records because of fires and wars, and during the French revolution, when estate archives were deliberately destroyed, it is difficult, if not impossible, to prove whether certain marquisates were ever raised to a formal marquisate.
Recent archive findings has shown that some titles previously believed to be only courtesy titles are, in fact, raised marquisates. Thus, the following list contains proven-raised marquisates, uncertain marquisates, proven-hereditary courtesy titles (or at least generally believed to be proven at this time), and feudal marquisates or margravates. (Marquisates are the modern replacement of margravates. Margravates created after 1500 are marquisates.)
In the "Type" column is an acronym or symbol that identifies the type of marquisate (or margravate) in that row.
The title holder of a marquisate before the French revolution was addressed as "Marquis de X". The "title stayed with the fief" but, strictly speaking, a buyer of a marquisate needed a confirmation of the marquisate to be able to use the title - otherwise, he or she could formally only be styled "Seigneur/Dame de Marquisat de X" (Lord/Lady of the Marquisate of X). The policy on this matter was fairly relaxed, however, and the number of confirmations were rather few, which did not hinder the usage of the title Marquis. In most cases, before the French revolution, once a fief was raised, the feudal rank of Marquisate remained even if the fief passed to new owners through marriage, inheritance, or purchase.
With the French revolution, feudalism was abolished and the titles became disconnected from the land they previously belonged to. Therefore, after the French revolution, it was no longer possible to purchase a former marquisate and thereby obtain the title Marquis, or any other noble title for that matter. Only a few marquisates in France were specifically transferable through marriage (opposite to the normal custom in Italy and Spain). This means many titles have became extinct when the last direct male descendant of the title holder at the time of the French revolution died. An adoption of another male person by the last, legal, male title holder could, in some respects, be treated as a legal transfer of the title itself, but never a transfer of nobility if the adopted male was not a noble.

Bug-eye glasses are a form of eyewear. They were popular in the late 20th century decades of the 1970s, 80s and 90s, and were used for regular glasses and sunglasses. They first became popular in the mid-70s, and succeeded the cat eye glasses of the 50s and 60s. In the 70s, they were more of a square shape, and then later evolved into the more characteristic, larger, rounder and more familiar bug-eyed style of the 80s. Their popularity began to decline later, as glasses became easier to get and more affordable. They were fashionable for men and women and are still fashionable today but as retro sunglasses. They were followed by the thick-rimmed, rectangular styled glasses of the 2000s. Notable wearers are: Audrey Hepburn, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Sophia Loren and Victoria Beckham, to name but a few.

Uncial 0114 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), ε 53 (von Soden); is a Greek–Coptic diglot uncial manuscript of the New Testament, dated palaeographically to the 8th-century.
Description.
The codex contains a small part of the Gospel of John, 20:4-6,8-10, on one very large parchment leaf. The size of the page is rather unusual. It is about 39 cm by 30 cm. The text is written in two columns per page, 32 lines per page, in uncial letters. It was classified as an uncial codex, but, according to the opinion of modern scholars, it is a lectionary. It is classified on Aland's List of New Testament lectionaries as ℓ "965".
The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type. Aland placed it in Category II. This means it has some alien readings.
Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 8th-century.
The codex now is located at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (Copt. 129,10, fol. 198), in Paris.

Twin reversed arterial perfusion

Twin reversed arterial perfusion is a rare complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies, involving an "acardiac twin" whose structural defects are incompatible with life, and an otherwise normal "pump" twin. It occurs in 1% of monochorionic twin pregnancies and in 1 in 35,000 pregnancies overall. It can result in TRAP syndrome, causing mortality and deformities in both twins.
Acardiac twin.
The "acardiac twin" is a parasitic twin that fails to develop a head, arms and a heart. The parasitic twin, little more than a torso with or without legs, receives its blood supply from the host twin by means of an umbilical cord-like structure (which often only has 2 blood vessels, instead of 3), much like a fetus in fetu, except the acardiac twin is outside the host twin's body. Although the reason is not fully understood, it is apparent that deoxygenated blood from the pump twin is perfused to the acardiac twin. The acardiac twin grows along with the pump twin, but due to inadequate perfusion it is unable to develop the structures necessary for life, and presents with dramatic deformities.
Although no two acardiac twins are alike, twins with this disorder are grouped into 4 classes: Acephalus, anceps, acormus, and amorphus.
(1) Acephalus - the most common type, lacking a head, though it may have arms. Thoracic organs are generally absent, and disorganized & unidentifiable tissues take their place.
(2) Anceps - The acardius has most body parts, including a head with face and incomplete brain. Organs, though present, are crudely formed.
(3) Acormus - This type has no apparent body and the umbilical cord is seemingly attached to the neck, but x-rays or dissection reveal thoracic structures in the apparent head. One had a leg apparently attached to the head. This may be due to embryopathy degenerating a once normal embryo.
(4) Amorphus - This extreme form not only lacks a head and limbs, but also any internal organs, and consists of tissues with blood vessels branching from the umbilical cord. Some may only be stem cell tumors.
Pump twin.
Structurally the pump twin is generally normal, but due some of the related problems including the rapid growth of the acardiac twin, polyhydramnios, and heart failure due to high output, there is a high mortality rate for the pump twin.
The use of a radio-ablation needle to coagulate the blood in the acardiac twin's umbilical cord, greatly increases the chances of the pump twin, to about 80%. Minimally invasive surgery is needed to effect this.

Walter Bishop (Fringe)

Walter Bishop, Ph.D. is a fictional character on the Fox television series "Fringe". He is portrayed by John Noble. Noble also plays Walter's counterpart in the show's parallel universe, who is referred to in the show as Walternate.
Arc.
Walter Bishop was born in London in 1946, and is the son of former allied spy, Doctor Robert Bischoff (Anglicized to Bishop following World War II). His father, a scientific pioneer at the University of Berlin, conducted espionage for the Allies within the Nazi government, sabotaged German research and smuggled scientific information to the Americans . Walter grew up with a love for science, and by the 1970s, became a head developer for a U.S. Government experimental research program called "Kelvin Genetics", alongside his long-time friend William Bell. He married Elizabeth Bishop in an undisclosed year, and their son, Peter Bishop was born in 1978.
Walter and his friend William Bell conducted numerous experiments in the area of fringe science, including developing highly advanced weapons for the Army. At some point during the 1970s, Walter and Bell discovered the existence of another universe, through the heightened use of LSD, among other drugs. They constructed a "trans-dimensional window", a portal which could view the other universe, which was more technologically advanced than our own (in "Peter", the Other Side appears to have already created digital cell phones by the year 1985). They began copying the advanced technologies they saw over there, and sold them to the Army to benefit this world. They spent much time sending objects over to the Other Side, including Bell's car, and discovered that the "multiverse" requires balance. If a car goes over the Other Side, then a car of the same mass must be sent into our universe.
In 1985, the now seven-year-old Peter contracted a rare and savage disease. Walter attempted numerous methods to cure him, ranging from trying to build a time machine to bring a researcher who specialized in these cases from the 1930s to the present, to watching his alternate self, dubbed "Walternate", work with advanced medicine to cure his own Peter in the alternate universe, who was also ill. But Walter could not save his son, and he died in his arms. Following the funeral, which Bell never attended, Walter became consumed with watching Walternate work to save the other Peter. Through the trans-dimensional window, Walter discovered that Walternate had formulated the correct cure for his son, but did not notice as he was distracted by The Observer known as September. Knowing that Walternate would not be able to cure the other Peter, Walter created the correct compound and built a doorway into the other universe, with the intentions of curing Peter there, and then to return home.
Nina Sharp, discovering Walter's intentions and their universally-destructive repercussions, went to stop Walter from opening the wormhole on Reiden Lake (the water from the lake would absorb any excess energy the doorway released). In the ensuing struggle, Walter managed to get through the wormhole, but Nina's arm was caught in-between both universes, and she needed to have a cybernetic arm put in its place. On the journey to the Other Side, the vial holding the cure was destroyed, forcing Walter to kidnap Peter, cure him back in our universe, and then return him. On the way back, they fell through an icy lake, but were rescued by September, who warned Walter that Peter could never return to the alternate universe. After he cured Peter, he and Elizabeth could not find themselves able to send Peter back, so they decided to raise him as their own.
In 1991, Walter's lab assistant, Dr. Carla Warren, was killed in a fire, and Walter was charged with manslaughter, but was deemed mentally unfit to be tried, so he was locked away inside the St. Claire's Mental Institution. Walter would spend 17 years inside St. Claire's, and was never visited by Peter. Bell, under the alias of Dr. Simon Paris, performed several brain surgeries on Walter, extracting pieces of Walter's brain tissue, which contained the memories of how he crossed universes, per the request of Walter himself, who was frightened of what he was becoming. With the pieces of his brain gone, Walter's intellect was diminished, and he was driven insane.
In the beginning of the first season, Olivia Dunham blackmailed the adult Peter Bishop to release his father from St. Claire's, in hopes of curing her lover, John Scott. Peter became Walter's legal guardian. After they saved John (who was thought to be a traitor, but later revealed to be an undercover NSA agent), Olivia requested that Walter and Peter remain in Boston, to which Peter reluctantly agreed.
In episode 1x04, "The Arrival", September returned and asked Walter to hide a mysterious cylinder for him. Peter became fed up with his father and decided to leave Boston, but was kidnapped by a man who wanted the cylinder for himself. September encountered Peter, and appeared to read his mind, making Peter realize "The Pattern" was far more than just plain coincidence. He also began to see that Walter was not as insane as he originally thought, and a father-son relationship started to blossom. And, Walter and Peter became civilian consultants to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, under the supervision of Phillip Broyles.
During the episode, "Safe", Mitchell Loeb and a team of bank robbers used a vibrational dematerializing device to steal components from safety deposit boxes around the country. The science team realized the safe belonged to Walter, and the components were all pieces of the machine he constructed in 1985 as his original plan to save Peter, but was eventually scrapped, which could "bring anybody from any time or anywhere". Loeb used the device to rescue David Robert Jones from a German prison, and Jones became ill with radiation poisoning soon after.
The organization Jones worked for, called "Zerstörung durch Fortschritte der Technologie" (ZFT), or, in English, "Destruction through advances in technology", was based on a self-published, anonymous manifesto under the same title. Walter discovered that the ZFT manifesto was written in his very lab, by William Bell, years ago, after they discovered the alternate universe. In episode 1x20, "There's More Than One of Everything", Walter reveals the existence of the Other Side to Peter, without telling him he was in fact from there. Walter and Peter helped Olivia and Fringe Division stop Jones from crossing over to the Other Side to kill William Bell, and carried on with their lives, now happy as father-and-son.
A subplot in the first season was Walter and Bell's experiments with a nootropic drug called "Cortexiphan", which they used on children. Olivia was among the children who were treated with it, and was able to see into the Other Side because of it. But, this left her emotionally scarred, and she is always defensive when it is brought up.
In the season two premiere, "A New Day in the Old Town", Walter and Peter learned that Olivia had returned to our side after visiting William Bell in the other universe, but, her return voyage left her gravely wounded and comatose. Walter seemed to be greatly affected by this, as he had begun to look to Olivia like his own daughter. Thankfully, she regained consciousness, and Walter learned that the person who tried to kill her was a shape-shifting assassin from the Other Side.
By now, Fringe Division is aware of the alternate universe, and just as the ZFT manifesto predicted, they had intentions to destroy us. In the episode "August", an Observer called August contacted Walter to help correct a mistake, which Walter initially believed was to send Peter back to the alternate universe, but, it was in fact a method on how to "cheat death", which he had achieved before. In episode 2x10, "Grey Matters", Walter was kidnapped by Thomas Jerome Newton, the shape-shifters' leader, and had his missing brain tissue re-implanted for a short time. Walter, temporarily sane, was forced to reveal to Newton who he crossed over to the other universe, and nearly died because of it, driving Peter to great lengths to save him. In the episode "Jacksonville", Walter reactivated Olivia's Cortexiphan abilities, and she was able to identify objects from the other universe because of their distinctive "glimmer". When she looked at Peter, she saw that he projected the same glimmer, making her realize he is from the Other Side. But, she eventually promises Walter that she would not tell Peter the truth, though Walter decides he must do it himself.
In the episode "White Tulip" Walter is seen writing a letter to Peter revealing to him that he was from the alternate universe. He is unable to bring himself to give the letter to Peter for the fear of losing him again is too great. The team are chasing down a man trying to rewind time to save his fiance from a fatal car crash. Each time the team comes close to catching him he "resets" time once again. Sent to negotiate with the time traveler, Walter tells him of his actions to save Peter and urges the man not to make the same mistake of changing the natural course of events, saying that he had "traveled through madness" to realize that some things must not be changed. Walter reveals that he has asked God to send him a sign of forgiveness in the form of a white tulip, a flower that did not bloom in that time of year. Heeding Walter's words, the man resets back to the day of his fiance's death and holds her as a truck hits their car, killing them both. It is later revealed that during his last time 'reset', the time traveler leaves a letter for Walter with a colleague, to be delivered on the original day of the case. When Walter opens the delivered letter, he finds a tulip drawn on a white piece of paper: his so desperately sought after "White Tulip."
In the episode "The Man from the Other Side" Peter, when attempting to foil Newton's plan of bringing a bridge from the parallel universe, unexpectedly discovers that he is in fact, not from this universe. He is injured and while in the hospital, confronts Walter ("You said the effects of Newton's vibrations would be devastating. And they were, they... destroyed that FBI agent... they just... disintegrated him like he wasn't even there. But they didn't kill the man from the other side... and they didn't kill me. I'm not from here, am I?") and angrily blames Walter for his mother (of our universe) committing suicide ("That's why my mother committed suicide, isn't it? She knew. Didn't she? And when I left, the guilt was too much for her to live with... the lie."). At the end of the episode, Olivia notifies a crushed Walter that Peter has checked out of the hospital and is now on the run.
In "Northwest Passage", Peter is subdued by Newton and meets the man from the other side, who reveals himself to be Walter from the other universe (Walternate). Recognizing him as his biological father, Peter agrees to accompany him back to the alternate universe, where "Walternate"—who is in full command of his faculties, and holds the position of U.S. Secretary of Defense—tasks him with working on a mysterious machine which Peter eventually discovers ominously requires him to serve as a component. Informed by the Observers that Peter is in danger, Walter and Olivia cross to the alternate universe to recover him, with Walter sustaining a gunshot wound in the process. On their return to our universe, Peter tells Walter that he still hasn't forgiven Walter for taking him from his family as a child, saying, "I've been trying to see this your way Walter... and I can't. But you did cross universes twice to save my life. That's got to count for something." This gives Walter the promise of eventual reconciliation.
Following the events of the season two finale, "Over There", Walter begins to readjust to life with Peter, but his son still shows a hint of resentment towards his father. Unbeknownst to either of them, the Olivia Dunham they returned to our universe with was in fact her doppelganger, "Fauxlivia", while the prime-Olivia was held captive in the other universe. Fauxlivia was under orders from Walternate to locate the pieces of the doomsday machine constructed by "The First People". Massive Dynamic and Fringe Division begin collecting the pieces and rebuilding the machine in a secure bunker, and Olivia is able to cross over momentarily to alert Peter of Fauxlivia's deception, who he had been romantically involved with. In 3x02, "The Box", Walter discovers that William Bell (who sacrified himself in the season two finale to allow the others to return to their universe) left him a controlling interest in Massive Dynamic, making him CEO of the company.
The science team captures Fauxlivia, but she is able to flee back to her own universe. Olivia manages to cross back onto our side, and reunites with the team. Following this, September reappears and orchestrates a series of events just to see if Walter is finally able to let Peter die, which he eventually realizes he can do. The science team visits the Massive Dynamic bunker where the doomsday machine is held, and it instantly activates because of the proximity to Peter, whose nose begins to bleed. The machine also does something to Peter—it "weaponizes" him. His behaviour slowly begins to change, and he even begins to hunt down and murder shape-shifters, making Walter realize the effect the machine has on him. After confronting him about it, it appears that Peter might be accepting what is happening to him, frightening Walter.
Religion.
In the first season Walter describes God as the only other individual who had access to all his research. In the second season Walter describes himself as a former atheist who realized he had committed a grievous crime against God when he stole Walternate's son and is now actively seeking forgiveness for his trespass. In the final episode of the third season Walter kneels before a Cross and begs God to spare humanity from obliteration.
Walternate.
Walter also exists in the show's parallel universe, though to distinguish between the prime and parallel versions of Walter, the show's characters as well as its producers, journalists, and fans, identify the parallel character as "Walternate", a portmanteau of "Walter" and "alternate". However, they have several key differences in personality: Walternate never suffers from the brain damage his counterpart does, and is thus completely in control of his mental facilities. He is also more ruthless and cruel than his counterpart, with a firm belief that the ends justify the means.
Walternate in the parallel universe had a similar history to Walter through 1985, having married the same Elizabeth and having their own child Peter. There are variations in their history as well, in part due to the William Bell of the parallel universe dying in a car accident as a child and thus never befriending Walternate. Walternate was appointed as the United States "national security czar", and saw that the Strategic Defense Initiative to its success. Walternate is also shown to have started a company called "Bishop Dynamic" (a parallel to Massive Dynamic, the company founded by William Bell in the prime universe).
In 1985, Walternate had worked on a cure for his Peter, but was distracted by September before seeing the successful result of the test. When Peter was kidnapped by Walter, Walternate slipped into depression and alcoholism, his job at risk, unable to explain how Peter was taken. After receiving moral support from Elizabeth, he returned to work, and later is surprised when young Olivia appears to him when she crosses over from the prime universe. Receiving her sketchbook, Walternate discovers that Peter is in the prime universe and resolves to get him back.
Leading into the show's present, Walternate has become the U.S. Secretary of Defense, overseeing a more militant Fringe division from his base on Liberty Island, though he has since separated from Elizabeth. He is also good friends with the second-in command of the Fringe Division, Colonel Phillip Broyles. He identified means of stopping the singularities caused by Walter's crossing in 1985 by using an amber-like substance to seal the area around these, regardless of the innocent lives trapped. He has also engineered the shapeshifters to cross to the prime universe and perform actions that ultimately allow him to cross over and convince Peter to return to the parallel universe. He shows Peter the doomsday device that they have found and reconstructed, and urges Peter to figure out how it works as the device only reacts to his biological signature. The purpose of the machine is later revealed during scene at a pub; the observer strolls by leaving behind a drawing depicting Peter being responsible for the apocalypse through the doomsday device.
When the prime universe Olivia and Walter arrive to rescue Peter, Walternate arranges for Olivia's doppelganger, Fauxlivia, to pretend she is Olivia and return with Walter and Peter. Having captured the original Olivia, Walternate subjects her to memory implantation to make he believe she is Fauxlivia while trying to recreate the Cortexiphan drug and understand its properties, intending to execute her once his goals are reached. Meanwhile, Walternate has engaged Fauxlivia to help the prime universe discover the same doomsday machine, eventually recovering one part that was missing in his construction. When it comes time for Fauxlivia to be extracted from the prime-universe, Walternate arranges for Olivia to be executed and her brain removed, with her body being used for the exchange of mass needed for Fauxlivia to return. However, a sympathetic Colonel Broyles helps Olivia escape, and is killed by Walternates mercenaries in the effort, causing Walter to use his friend's body for the mass-exchange, but has it mutilated first so that it would have the same mass as Fauxlivia.
When Fauxlivia returns and finds out she is pregnant with Peter's child and Walternate's grandchild, Walternate 'offers' to help in any way he can, believing the child will be an alternative way of activating the doomsday device through acquiring Peter's genes, going as far as to organize an anonymous kidnapping of Fauxlivia and accelerating her pregnancy to ensure the baby's survival. By now it is revealed that the vengeful, relentless Walternate's only previous interest in Peter was his unique biological blueprint needed to activate the machine. Believing that now that Peter has chosen his side, he doesn't hesitate to proceed to activate the machine with the intent of destroying the prime universe and his son along with it.
However, the machine does not work as expected: while it accelerates the deterioration of the prime-universe, it does not begin to heal the alternate one. After Peter activates the prime-universe version of the machine in an attempt to combat the decay, Walternate discovers he cannot shut down his version of it, and attempts to have Fauxlivia do it, believing that she might be able to access the same telekinetic powers as her counterpart. However, Peter uses the prime-universe machine to create a "bridge" between both worlds, so that both can work together to heal their prospective universes, an alliance which Walternate grudgingly agrees to.
Walternates middle name is shown as Harold on a certificate in his office on Liberty Island.
Development.
Australian actor John Noble was cast in January 2008 as "an institutionalized scientist whose work might be at the center of the coming storm". At the time, he was a relatively unknown actor best known to audiences as Denethor in the 2003 film "". Noble became aware of the "Fringe" casting call from his daughter, actress Samantha Noble. He explained, "She was in L.A. She said, 'Dad'—she rang me—'Dad, there's a role that's made for you. I've heard it, everyone's talking about it. J.J. Abrams.' So I rang my manager, and I said, 'Well, this role.' And they said, 'No, no, no, it's not for you, you're too young for it.' I said, 'Oh, okay, glad I asked.' So I went back to Australia and we were back there over the Christmas break, and she was there as well. I got a phone call", asking him to tape his audition. He taped it with his daughter and sent it; Noble commented "And that was it, off that tape. This is so unusual. Off that tape, I was cast as Walter Bishop. Just unheard of."
Noble has closely worked with the "Fringe" writers to develop his character's traits, in particular those that relate to Walter's madness. He explained, I did my own research into those rare breed, the geniuses, and it's not that they are anti-social — they simply have no social skills. It misses the point, in a way, to think any other way about it. I also studied the people who have been subjected to a lot of drug use — prescription and otherwise, the psychotropic drugs and so forth — and what happens in mental institutions. Walter would have been subjected to electroshock therapy, so that was something I looked into, what the short- and long-term effects might be. I made all of that part of Walter." For his character's accent, the Australian actor developed a Mid-Atlantic English dialect, which Noble described as "sort of a Boston accent, but tempered with a bit of fake English, from years of flying around to conferences and talking to other academics from all over the world." In his research, Noble noticed many prominent scientists had "complicated and interesting relationships" with music, causing him to create a similar bond between it and his character.
In a November 2008 interview with the "Los Angeles Times", Jeff Pinkner has called the character of Walter "incredibly fun to write for because he can say and do anything, which is a blast for a writer. He's incredibly brilliant and he's forgotten just how brilliant he is. He's scared of his own shadow, and he's scared of the things he's done in the past, and he's incredibly childlike." Pinkner continued that he, the other writers, and Noble himself have striven to focus on Walter's humanity, " plays it from a believable place and doesn't play him from a goofball, cuddly cute place. That's our prime directive: Keep it real and honest."
Personality.
A mad scientist who has had parts of his brain removed by his partner, William Bell, and who spent more than 17 years in a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane, Walter Bishop can best be described as an eccentric man. Once a brilliant scientist in the realm of fringe science, his trials in life have left him with gaps in his memory and with traits that can best be described as child like. While many parts of his intellect remain intact, he suffers from some degree of agoraphobia and has difficulty properly looking after himself, such that in both timelines he requires either Peter or Astrid to provide him with a basic level of care and supervision. He has a great penchant for culinary arts, and can be found cooking and eating at odd times, for example, both in his lab while performing autopsies, and while naked in Peter's kitchen. Red licorice seems to be among his most favorite of foods, though he also has a penchant for custard, root beer floats, and pastries. In line with his child like demeanor, Walter Bishop has a lovable innocence about him which is occasionally interrupted by tantrum like outbursts over largely trivial things. One such outburst occurred in the supermarket when he discovered the use brominated food additives in pop tarts, when he was shopping for pudding, and another occurred in a hotel room, in which he found the thought of being surrounded by germs too great to handle. His personality contrasts sharply with that of his parallel universe counterpart, "Walternate"; the Secretary of Defense, who is cool, collected, serious, and has a clandestine way about him which gives others the impression that he is untrustworthy.
While some of these differences are likely attributed to the fact that Walternate was never been institutionalized nor had parts of his brain removed, there is evidence to suggest that the personalities of the two Walters began to diverge long before the death of Peter Bishop the boy, from the primary universe. In the primary universe, Walter chose to come home the night his son would die, and it was Walter who showed his son how to do the coin trick. In the parallel universe, Walternate chose to remain at his lab, and it was his wife who showed their son the coin trick. Additionally, when Walter crossed over and kidnapped Walternate's Peter by impersonating him, the boy picked up on the subtle differences between the two and accused Walter of not being his real father. Apparently, Walternate does not wear brown jackets. The progenitor of this divergence might have inadvertently been William Bell. Walter and William Bell met as children and experimented liberally with drugs such as LSD in their youth, while Walternate never had the opportunity to meet the William Bell of his universe.
Nevertheless, we can occasionally see flickers of Walternate's cold demeanor in Walter, for example, when Walter sedated Astrid without her permission, by jamming a needle into the back of her neck, so that he could sneak away from the lab, and in the future when he coldly responds to a compliment with an insult. Though the latter situation occurred after cells from the removed portions of his brain were used to repair brain damage he had sustained.
Other similarities shared by the two Walters include a tendency to engage in what most would call scientifically unethical behavior, and a stubborn hatred of one another.
Relationships.
Prior to the pilot, Walter was estranged from his son, Peter, who was largely raised by his mother Elizabeth. Elizabeth committed suicide while Walter was in the mental institution. Walter and Peter have since gradually grown closer, though the relationship suffered upon Peter learning he was taken from the parallel universe as a boy.
Walter has remained fond of Olivia, and it was later revealed that she was one of his test subjects for his nootropic drug, Cortexiphan. Their relationship suffered when Olivia learned about this connection. Walter also is close with his lab assistant Astrid Farnsworth.
Reception.
Critical reception.
Maureen Ryan of the "Chicago Tribune" called Noble the series' "secret weapon" for his ability to "move with lightning speed between surreal goofiness and touching insecurity, often within a single scene." "Paste" magazine named Noble as the 23rd best performance of 2010, calling him "excellent right out of the gate" and Walter as the "show's best character". "TV Squad" named Walter one of 2010's best television characters. The "Los Angeles Times" called Walter Bishop one of the best characters of 2008, noting, "the role of the modern-day mad scientist could so easily have been a disaster, but the 'Fringe' writers and the masterful John Noble have conspired to create a character that seems, as trite as it sounds, more Shakespearean than sci-fi."
Accolades.
For the second season, Noble submitted his work for consideration in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards. Noble was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2008 and 2009. For the 2010, 2011, and 2012 Saturn Awards, Noble received nominations for Best Supporting Actor on Television, winning in 2011. Noble was nominated in 2009 and won in 2010 for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at "Entertainment Weekly"s EWwy Awards. In 2011, for his work in the third season, Noble won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the 1st Critics' Choice Television Awards and received a second nomination in 2012.

<doc id="19808298" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19808298" title="Nuvelo">
Nuvelo

Nuvelo Inc. was a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for acute cardiovascular disease, cancer and other debilitating medical conditions. Corporate officers included Chairman Dr. George Rathmann (founder and CEO of Amgen), CEO Dr. Ted Love, and Executive Vice President Research & Development Dr. Michael Levy. On January 27, 2009, the company was acquired by ARCA Biopharma, Inc. in a reverse takeover transaction.
The company.
Nuvelo, Inc. was located at San Carlos, California and had approximately 250 employees. The Company’s development pipeline included:
In addition, Nuvelo had research programs in leukemia therapeutic antibodies and Wnt signaling pathway therapeutics to expand its drug pipeline and create additional partnering and licensing opportunities.
Start-up phase and core competency.
Nuvelo was initially founded as Hyseq in August 1992 and based on DNA array technology. Hyseq’s genomic platform was used to develop gene based therapeutics and diagnostics. At the rate of more than 1,000,000 human DNA samples analyzed per month during 1997, Hyseq was a large partial human gene sequence database with over 5,000,000 sequences. The HyX platform had five core technologies:
Transition towards therapeutics.
Applications that were developed making use of the genomic platform included gene identification, expression analysis, polymorphism screening and diagnostic testing. The company strategy was to exploit this platform technology to enter gene discovery and to eventually produce therapeutic drugs.
This technology led to collaborations and partnerships with companies and academic institutions including Affymetrix, PerkinElmer, Aurora biosciences, Amgen, Genetastix, Agilent Technologies, Callida Genomics, Aspen Institute, University of California at San Francisco, Celera Diagnostics, Surromed, Variagenics, Sequenom, Archemix, Amgen and Bayer. The company also created revenue by out-licensing their technologies with other companies.
Partnerships.
In the early days of Nuvelo, when they were called Hyseq, there was a great deal of partnering activity. This was due to their business model which centered on their high-throughput sequencing platform. The company simply partnered or licensed out any novel discovery that did not fall into their desired disease space. Listed below are some of the material collaborations that the company undertook.
Dendreon.
Nuvelo obtained the worldwide rights for all indication of rNAPc2 and other rNAPc molecules owned by Dendreon Corporation.
Dendreon was paid an upfront fee of $4.0 million with an additional $23.5 million if all development and commercialization milestones are achieved. In addition, royalty payments were structured.
Amgen.
In October 2004, Nuvelo obtained the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize alfimeprase from Amgen in exchange for future payment to Amgen as negotiated under their initial deal.
Archemix.
In January 2004, the company signed a 50/50 agreement with Archemix.
In July 2006, the collaboration was expanded in that Archemix became responsible for the discovery of short-acting aptamers targeting coagulation cascade for use in acute cardiovascular procedures. Nuvelo was responsible for the development and commercialization of any products discovered.
Bayer.
January 2006, Nuvelo partnered to develop Alfimeprase. Bayer was to commercialize the drug outside the United States. Nuvelo retained commercial rights in the United States market and was to receive ROW royalties ranging from 15% to 37.5%.
The deal was structured with a $50 million upfront payment and milestone payments totaling $385 million ($165M in development milestones and $170M in sales and commercialization). Although many of these milestones were never achieved, in 2006 a total of $28.9M was billed to Bayer under their cost-sharing agreement.
In February 2003, Hyseq merged with Variagenics giving birth to “Nuvelo Inc.” to further development of drug “alfimeprase.” This drug therapy was developed against peripheral arterial occlusion or “Leg Attack” disease and was approved as orphan drug status. This accelerated the clinical development of alfimeprase.
Merger.
Early stage clinical trials for alfimeprase with NU206 (R-respondin protein) and NU172 (short acting thrombin inhibitor) were promising and were approved by the FDA. Bayer was collaborating with Nuvelo on late stage studies on alfimeprase. After Nuvelo’s failure in these studies, Bayer closed the deal in June 2007. However, Nuvelo was optimistic and continued the trial with alfimeprase. However, in March 2008, Nuvelo’s phase II trial failed to meet endpoints, thereby forcing Nuvelo to discontinue the trial. The company laid off forty employees and restructured the organization. Also, Dr. Michael Levy, Executive Vice President, Research and Development left the company
Nuvelo’s market cap reached a peak of approximately $US 1 billion in the lead up to alfimeprase Phase 3 studies completion, but share price plummeted eventually to less than $1 and received notification from NASDAQ. Despite this, Nuvelo was able to show positive proof of concept for NU172 in August 2008. Following this, Nuvelo was merged with ARCA Biopharma Inc. on September 26, 2008 forming a late stage cardiovascular biotechnology company. ARCA biopharma focuses on developing genetically targeted cardiovascular therapies, with lead candidate drug Gencaro, a beta blocker and vaso-dilator. It was Nuvelo’s genetically targeted technology and cardiovascular drug development that interested ARCA Biopharma in acquiring the company.
According to the merger agreement, Nuvelo issued new shares of its common stock to ARCA stockholders and assumed the outstanding options and warrants involved. Novelo CEO Ted Love took a seat on the board of the combined business and Arca CEO Richard Brewer became CEO of the new business. The option and warrant holders were expected to own 67% of the combined company’s common stock and Nuvelo stockholders 33% of the new company.

Jens Boyesen

Jens Mogens Boyesen (9 October 1920 – 20 November 1996) was a Norwegian diplomat and politician for the Labour Party.
Personal life.
He was born in Kristiania as a son of deputy under-secretary of state Einar Theiste Boyesen (1888–1972) and Borghild Koppang (1888–1978). He had a younger brother Einar who was killed during the Second World War. Fleeing occupied Norway after his involvement in Milorg was discovered, Einar Boyesen enrolled in the Norwegian Independent Company 1 and was killed during a mission in Norway in March–April 1945.
From 1944 to 1947 Jens Boyesen was married to Alix Dorry Sophie Theslöf. She later married Erling Steen. In 1955 he married journalist Erle Sigrun Bryn, a daughter of Norwegian Maritime Director Erling Bryn.
Career.
At the time Norway was invaded by Germany in 1940, Boyesen was a law student and member of the Labour Party. The Labour cabinet Nygaardsvold fled to London in order to avoid an early capitulation. Germany occupied Norway for five years, whereas Boyesen became a part of the resistance movement. He was a messenger for both the Norwegian government-in-exile and the Norwegian legation in Stockholm, communicating on behalf of the so-called "Kretsen", an inner circle of the resistance movement for which he was the secretary. Within "Kretsen", he cooperated especially close with former Supreme Court Justice Ferdinand Schjelderup. Approaching the winter of 1944, Boyesen was no longer safe in Norway, and fled to Sweden. He worked as a secretary for the Norwegian legation in Stockholm until the liberation of Norway in 1945.
After the war Boyesen finished his law studies, graduating as cand.jur. in 1947. He worked as a deputy judge from 1948, and then as an advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1949. He then spent many years as a State Secretary in Torp's Cabinet, first in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1951 to 1954 and in the Ministry of Defence from 1954 to 1955. He later returned as State Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1963 to 1965, during Gerhardsen's Fourth Cabinet.
From 1955 to 1963 he had been Norway's Permanent Representative to NATO. When appointed, he was the youngest ambassador of Norway. In 1964 he was mentioned by Norwegian media as a candidate to take over as Secretary General of NATO after Dirk Stikker. Among the mentioned candidates was Manlio Brosio, who actually got the position. Boyesen was instead sent to Geneva to serve as ambassador to the international organizations seated in that city, including the European Free Trade Association. He served from 1968 to 1973.
When the first cabinet Bratteli assumed office in 1971, Boyesen was tipped by newspapers to take over as Minister of Foreign Affairs. This did not happen.

James Crossley (author)

James Crossley (1800–1883) was an English author, bibliophile and literary scholar. By profession he was a lawyer.
Life.
He was born in Halifax, and moved to Manchester in 1816. Some of his early essays were published in the "Retrospective Review".
He perpetrated a literary fraud, the forging of "Fragment on Mummies", supposedly by Sir Thomas Browne, that was a highly successful hoax. The bogus nature of the "Fragment", given by Crossley to George Wilkin to publish, is now regarded as highly probable, but Crossley never precisely confessed to it.
He set up the Chetham Society in 1843, with Thomas Corser, Francis Robert Raines and others: it was named after Humphrey Chetham and its purpose was to edit and publish historical works relating to Lancashire and Cheshire. In the following years he personally edited many of its publications: including the "Autobiographical tracts" of John Dee (1851), and the Diary of John Worthington. He served as President from 1847 until 1883.
He is said to have collected 100,000 books at his residence in Chorlton on Medlock and later Stocks House, Cheetham. He supplied the novelist William Ainsworth with historical material and ideas; he was in business with Ainsworth's father Thomas, and their friendship was lifelong.

Joshua Kalsakau is a Vanuatuan politician. In 2005 Kalsakau, then the Minister for Ni-Vanuatu Business and an MP from Efate representing the National Community Association Party, joined the Vanuatu Labour Party. Kalsakau became the president of the VLP.
Joshua Kalsakau was reelected to his seat in Parliament, as MP for Efate, in the 2008 parliamentary election. After the elections, Kalsakau was named as the new Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Edward Natapei, though he was subsequently dismissed during a Cabinet reshuffle. He returned to government in April 2011, when Prime Minister Sato Kilman (who had ousted Natapei in a vote of no confidence in December 2010) was in turn ousted in a vote of no confidence, and succeeded by Serge Vohor. Vohor gave the Labour Party two portfolios in his Cabinet, and Kalsakau was appointed Deputy Prime Minister. Three weeks later, however, Vohor's election and premiership were voided by the Court of Appeal, and Kalsakau lost his position in government. On 16 June, Kilman's election and premiership were themselves voided by the Supreme Court, on constitutional grounds, and previous Prime Minister Edward Natapei became caretaker Prime Minister until a new leader could be elected. Kalsakau was appointed caretaker Minister of Infrastructure and Public Utilities.

Svolværgeita

Svolværgeita () is a tall pinnacle at the southwest face of Fløyfjellet on the island of Austvågøya in the Lofoten archipelago. The high Fløyfjellet is located on the edge of the town of Svolvær in the municipality of Vågan in Nordland county, Norway. The first recorded time a climber reached the summit of Svolværgeita was on 1 August 1910 by Ferdinand Schjelderup, Alf Bonnevie Bryn and Carl Wilhelm Rubenson.
Name.
The first element is Svolvær, since it is located in that town. The last element is the finite form of "geit" which means "goat", since the mountain has two "horns". The two horns are called "Storhorn" and "Lillehorn". By descending from Storhorn it is common to jump over a 1.5 metre wide gap and land safely on Lillehorn, while viewing the town cemetery 300 metre below.
First ascent.
The "1910 Route" was first climbed by Bryn, Schjelderup and Rubinson. They reached the top by 11 pm on 1 August 1910. Their route includes a diagonal traverse across the north wall of the mountain, led by Rubinson. Before the climb, the tree had bet a local hotel owner a bottle of wine that they would reach the Goat summit. The group of Bryn, Schjelderup and Rubinson had shortly before finished the first successful ascent of Stetind, on 30 July. Two days later, on 3 August, the same group made the first ascent of Trakta, one of the most difficult summits to reach in Norway. 
Climbing routes.
In addition to "The 1910 Route", several other routes to the summit of The Goat have been described. The longest and classic route is "The Front Side" (grade 5+), first climbed by Wilhelm Høyer and Alf Krane in 1947. Another route is "The Vegetarian" (grade 5, A1). The route "Highway to heaven" (grade 6+, A2) was first ascended in August 1991. The "Rappel Route" (grade 5) was first top-roped by Svein Smaaskjær in the 1960s. "The Back Side" (also called "The Spiral Route") (grad 5+) was first climbed in 1928 by Bror Bommen and Bjørn Lyche. The harder "Angelwings" (grad 6+) was first aid climbed by Arild Meyer and Hugo Bjørnstad in 1974, and first free-climbed in 1993 by Ed Webster, Arild Meyer and Odd-Roar Wik.

De Natura Sonoris

De natura sonoris ("On the nature of sound") is the title of three works by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki.
"De natura sonoris No. 1" (the number was appended later) was composed in 1966. The title was inspired by Lucretius's "De rerum natura" ("On the nature of things"). As the title suggests, it is a vigorous exploration of wildly divergent orchestral effects and dynamics. It was premiered on 7 April 1966 at the International Festival of Contemporary Art in the French town of Royan.
"De natura sonoris No. 2" was composed five years later to a commission by the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Penderecki again took up the theme of vividly contrasting orchestral colouration, including unusual percussive effects: an iron bar is struck by implements such as a hammer and a saw. It was premiered on 3 December 1971 at Juilliard under the conductor Jorge Mester.
Both pieces are approximately eight minutes in length each, with "De Natura Sonoris No. 2" being the longer of the two. In 1975 the composer recorded both works with the Polish Radio National Symphony Orchestra for EMI.
In 2012, Penderecki composed De Natura Sonoris No. 3.
Other uses.
Penderecki's 1975 recordings of both works feature heavily on the soundtrack of the 1980 film "The Shining", directed by Stanley Kubrick.

Monument Mountain (reservation)

Monument Mountain is the name of a popular open space reservation located in Great Barrington, Massachusetts on the southeast side of Monument Mountain. The reservation is centered around the subordinate summit of "Squaw Peak." It is managed by The Trustees of Reservations, a non-profit conservation organization and is notable for its expansive views of the Housatonic River Valley, The Berkshires, the Taconic Mountains, and the Catskill Mountains of New York from the knife-edge summit of Squaw Peak. Monument Mountain, composed of erosion resistant quartzite, is of The Berkshires geology. The reservation receives over 20,000 visitors a year.
History.
Monument Mountain has been the subject of art and literature since as early as 1815 when the poet William Cullen Bryant penned "Monument Mountain," an account of the story of a Mohican woman who allegedly leapt from what is now called Squaw Peak. In 1850, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville picnicked on the mountain; a thunderstorm forced them to seek cover in a boulder cave where they engaged in a lengthy discussion which inspired some of Melville's ideas for his novel Moby Dick.
In the 1930s, red pines were planted on the reservation; by that time much of the mountain had been heavily logged for the charcoal industry in support of iron foundries in Falls Village, Connecticut and Lenox, Massachusetts.
The reservation was acquired as the gift of Helen C. Butler in 1899 and John Butler Swann in 1980. Additional parcels were purchased in 1985 and 1986.
Recreation.
A trailhead parking lot is located on Massachusetts Route 7 north of Great Barrington center. The trail system consists of the "Hickey Trail" and "Indian Monument Trail" which form a loop around Squaw Peak; and "Squaw Peak Trail" which ascends the knife edge summit between the other two trails. An unnamed waterfall is located to along the Hickey Trail. "Devil's Pulpit," part of Squaw Peak, is a free-standing pillar of stone visible from the Squaw Peak Trail.
The reservation is open to hiking, picnicking, and hunting (in season).

San Girolamo della Carità

San Girolamo della Carità is a church in Rome, Italy, located near the Palazzo Farnese and Campo de' Fiori.
The church belonged originally to the Franciscan Observants. In 1524 it was taken over by the Archconfraternita della Carità, founded by Giulio de' Medici (later Pope Clement VII) in 1519; a society of noblemen from outside Rome. The upper nave balconies served as a first meeting place for St. Philip Neri's Oratorians founded in 1561 before they were established as a Congregation in 1575 and, in the same year, given the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella.
Domenico Castello rebuilt the church in the mid 17th century.
Interior.
The first chapel to the right (Cappella Spada), although originally assigned to Orazio Spada in 1575, was refurbished by Virgilio and Bernardino Spada in 1654-57. As a friend of Virgilio, the name of the Baroque architect Francesco Borromini has long been associated with the chapel but it has been argued that the overall design was probably directed by Virgilio Spada. The altar rail is by Gianlorenzo Bernini's pupil, Antonio Giorgetti.
The small but superbly finished Antamoro Chapel is dedicated to S Filippo Neri. The chapel itself was designed by Filippo Juvarra, the only work of his in Rome, and constructed in 1708-1709. The decoration of the chapel with the back lit statue of "The Ecstasy of S Filippo Neri" and two stucco reliefs in the ceiling was conceived by Juvarra in intimate cooperation with his close friend, the French sculptor Pierre Le Gros, who was responsible for carrying out the sculptural components.

Brian Óscar Sarmiento (born 22 April 1990) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays for Associação Atlética Ponte Preta in Brazil, as a forward.
Other than in Argentina, he played club football in Spain and Brazil.
Club career.
Born in Rosario, Santa Fe, Sarmiento began his career in Argentina with Estudiantes de La Plata, signing for La Liga side Racing de Santander in July 2007. A complicated transfer situation between both clubs, which involved the Court of Arbitration for Sport's mediation, meant that the 17-year-old spent the entire 2007–08 season without making a single first-team appearance.
For the 2008–09 campaign Sarmiento was loaned to Xerez CD in Segunda División, first appearing officially in a 1–1 home draw against Real Murcia on 3 September 2008 for that year's Copa del Rey. Although not an undisputed starter, he did feature significantly as the Andalusians achieved a first-ever top flight promotion, earning the nickname "Currito de Jerez" by club fans in the process.
On 31 August 2009 Sarmiento went on another season-long loan, yet in the second level, now with Girona FC. He made his first appearance on 3 October in a 2–2 draw against SD Huesca, scoring his team's second goal, but was released by the Catalans in late January 2010 for disciplinary issues, subsequently training with former club Santander to stay fit.
Sarmiento spent 2010–11 with UD Salamanca, again on loan and in the Spanish division two. On 15 January 2011 he netted his first league for goal for the Castile and León team, but in 2–3 home loss to FC Barcelona B. On 1 March he scored the game's only goal at home over Villarreal CF B, helping the side to its first win in three months.
International career.
Sarmiento was named "Best Newcomer" while playing for the Argentine U-17 team, in a friendly tournament in 2006. He also represented the nation at under-20 level.

Later in 2002 BNC was honored by the Colorado State House of Representatives with CO House Resolution #02-1009 "for its commitment to bringing arts to the metropolitan region and for providing a wonderful educational haven to individuals who are interested in dance". By 2005 BNC had grown into the second largest ballet company in the State of Colorado. At the start of their 2007-2008 season BNC made a significant adjustment to their marketing campaign and established a widespread presence on the internet including profiles on Facebook and MySpace as well as video postings on YouTube. BNC has never had a permanent home performance venue. The school and offices are based out of their Broomfield location and the company performs in a variety of spaces, taking the position that "wherever there's a stage there can be dance as well."
Garrison's Departure & Administrative Changes.
In December 2009 BNC's Board of Directors made the decision to dismiss Lissy Garrison from her position as executive director, the longest holder of this position till that time. In 1995 Garrison joined BNC as a consultant to the Board of Directors, served as president of the board for two years and became Executive Director in 1999.
BNC never disclosed the circumstances surrounding the firing of Garrison. However since her departure "Ballet Nouveau has changed its administrative structure. Instead of the artistic director being subordinate to the executive director as before, both now report directly to the board and are considered peers."
In the summer of 2010 Garrison's position was filled by Shari Ammon Mills, the sister of the artistic director, Garrett Ammon. On January 12, 2011 BNC appointed Christin Crampton Day, a former Colorado Ballet board member and public relations professional to replace Ammon Mills.
Funding.
Ballet Nouveau Colorado is a non-profit 501(c)(3) arts organization and as such is supported by donations, fundraisers, and ticket sales. BNC is also supported in part by the The Scientific and Cultural Facilities District of Adams, Broomfield, and Jefferson Counties and by the Broomfield Community Foundation. Ballet Nouveau earns 60 percent of its revenues from ticket sales and school tuition. BNC also partners with local communities and businesses to assist in fundraising.
One of BNC's partnerships has been with local businessman Don Ferguson, who donated time and services to the ballet company for free. Ferguson has provided BNC with about 200 hours a year of his time and has saved the organization an estimated $20,000 to $30,000 a year.
Due in part to profiles in "Dance" and "Pointe" magazines, the company is gaining a national reputation, standing alongside Colorado Ballet and Aspen Santa Fe Ballet as a leader in the Rocky Mountain West. However only half of the company's $1 million annual budget goes to professional performances, significantly less than either Colorado Ballet or Aspen Santa Fe.
On July 8, 2010 a message was e-mailed to all of BNC's "patrons, friends, and partners" requesting an additional $198,000 in donations before July 31, 2010. The message, which was also posted on the main page of the company's website warned that without the additional funds the company would need to suspend operations. The letter, signed by artistic director, Garrett Ammon and his sister, the newly appointed executive director, Shari Ammon Mills stated, "We are determined to never find ourselves in this position again. We are diligently working on new strategies and objectives that will enable us to more effectively support and sustain the continued advancement of our school, company and community programs."
Nouveau at Night.
Nouveau at Night is an annual fundraising event held by BNC at the start of their professional season each year. It offers a silent auction with pieces ranging from gift certificates, art, and jewelry to classes, wine, and luxury travel packages. Complimentary glasses of Beaujolais Nouveau are available to guests in addition to premiere performances by the professional company and a night of dancing to live music.
Proceeds from the fundraiser support various aspects of the organization, including arts in education partnerships with four Title I elementary schools in North Denver, The Ugly Duckling Anti-Bullying Program, and new performance pieces.
Ballet Nouveau Colorado Day.
On November 21, 2008, BNC held its annual fundraiser at the Westin Tabor Center bringing the event to Downtown Denver for the first time. Attendance at the fundraiser reached close to 400 people. On behalf of Denver's Mayor John Hickenlooper, the director of the Denver Office of Strategic Partnerships, Mike Roque proclaimed the day "Ballet Nouveau Colorado Day" in the city and county of Denver. More than 300 items were offered at the silent auction. The fundraiser featured Artistic Director Garrett Ammon's "Mediate", a performance choreographed to INXS music.
The Company.
When BNC was founded in 1992 it hired professional dancers only on an "as-needed" basis. In 2002 BNC began to perform professionally maintaining a full-time professional company for the duration of its 25 week session, with only five dancers the first year.
For their 2009-2010 season BNC had 12 professional dancers. During the season the dancers report for a five-day workweek. In addition to rehearsals and performances, company members also participate in outreach programs at local public schools. Some company members also teach classes in the ballet school.
Artistic Directors.
Robert Mills.
Robert Mills, two-time National Choreographic Plan Award winner and teacher acted as artistic director for the company from the 2004-2005 season through the 2006-2007 season. Mills choreographed various contemporary pieces for the company during his three-year term such as "face.2.face", a collaboration between BNC and the all-male, all-vocal Boulder, CO based rock band, Face. He is also known for choreographing the one-act show "Moulin Rouge" to music by Jacques Offenbach for BNC's debut at the downtown Denver, CO landmark, the Paramount Theater. For the next three years the company performed Valentine's Day performances at this venue. At the end of the company's fifth season Robert Mills left to become the artistic director for the Oklahoma City Ballet
Ammon and Fay.
Following Robert Mills's departure BNC recruited Ballet Memphis principal dancers and married couple Garrett Ammon and Dawn Fay. Ammon, winner of the Individual Artist Fellowship for choreography in 2007 from the Tennessee Arts Commission stepped into the role of artistic director and his wife, named one of Dance Magazine's "25 to Watch" for 2007, took on the newly created position of associate artistic director. The new artistic team's first season with BNC took on the theme "Experience the Evolution" and premiered Ammon's "Love of My Life," a ballet choreographed to Queen music, at BNC's annual showcase. The new show was later featured at the fundraiser, Nouveau at Night. Ammon went on to reinvent BNC's Valentine's Day show, "Moulin Rouge", which had originally been presented two years earlier as a one act set in a Toulouse-Lautrec-esque Parisienne cafe choreographed by former artistic director, Robert Mills. Ammon's "Moulin Rouge," a full-length show, was a love story inspired by the 1894 Gothic horror novel "Trilby," by George du Maurier and featured the hypnotist character Svengali. Collaborating with BNC's staff, Ammon and Fay developed the "21st Century Choreography Competition," an American Idol-like contest for choreographers utilizing YouTube, video blogs, and other forms of digital media as one method of making the company more modern.
Contemporary Ballet.
BNC, as a contemporary ballet company presents performances with modern highlights such as ballet choreographed to rock music, collaborations with poets and music groups and internet driven choreography competitions. "Partly out of financial necessity and partly in keeping with its youthful spirit" the company has also worked to utilize various emerging choreographers
"We Dance, You Vote".
For the 2007-2008 season BNC invited choreographers from around the country to submit their work via YouTube as part of their 21st Century Choreography Competition. Then, based on public vote and the vote of BNC's artistic director, Garrett Ammon, three finalists were chosen. Each finalist was given around 25 hours of rehearsal time at BNC’s Broomfield, Colorado studios to set their work on the BNC dance company.
BNC posted behind-the-scenes video podcasts throughout the rehearsel process. The finalists were given a commission of $1,500 and the winner was awarded a cash prize and a contract to develop works for BNC. The winner is ultimately chosen by popular vote from the audience (via text messaging or paper ballot), Garrett Ammon, and guest judges from the "Arts Business Community" such as Daniel Cappello, assistant editor of The New Yorker and dance professionals such as Wendy Perron, editor of Dance Magazine. The competition was continued for a second season and was rebranded "Dancemakers 2.0".
Ballet & Popular Music.
At the beginning of BNC's 2007-2008 season the then new artistic director, Garrett Ammon premiered his ballet "Love of My Life," a performance choreographed to the music of Queen. Before joining BNC, Ammon had choreographed a work titled, "Mediate" set to INXS music. On October 31, 2008 BNC premiered its second show of the 2008-2009 season, "Garrett Ammon's Rock Ballets." Accompanied by "Mediate" and "Love of My Life" was the world premiere of "An Occasional Dream," a ballet set to the songs of David Bowie. According to Ammon, "Unlike traditional ballets that tell a story, movements in these ballets follow the inspiration of the music". 
The 2009-2010 season of BNC featured "POP," a ballet that blends pop music and ballet in the style of Rock Ballets. Ammon was joined by 2008 choreography competition finalist, Alex Ketley and 2009 choreography competition winner, Joshua Blake Carter in creating contemporary works for the season's opener. "POP" consisted of four pieces, three premieres and one revival. Carter's piece, "Nothing is forever, darling" utilized the music of Rufus Wainwright while Ketley's "Kill the Anthem" was a blend of indie rock and electronic featuring music from Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Test Icicles, The Knife, and MGMT. Ammon's two pieces included the world premiere of "Bang Bang" a piece choreographed entirely to Nancy Sinatra's music and "and tomorrow came" a piece that originally premiered on April 4, 2008 at BNC and features music by the indie folk artist Joanna Newsome.
25 To Watch.
's professional company was featured at the top of Dance Magazine's "25 TO WATCH: WHO WILL SHINE IN '09" list in the magazine's January 2009 issue. The "25 to Watch" feature opened with a two-page spread listing the 25 companies, dancers, and choreographers to make the list and an article on BNC superimposed over a photo taken by Garret Ammon of BNC dancer, Megan Coatney. One of only two dance companies listed in the 25, the article highlighted the company's 21st Century Choreography Competition, Garret Ammon's Rock Ballets, and BNC's collaboration with Colorado's Lighthouse Writers' Workshop on the February 2009 performance, "Love," featuring new choreography from Ammon, Ma Cong (winner of the 2008 choreography competition), and Canada-based choreographer Mark Godden.

<doc id="19808760" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19808760" title="Oxford by-election, 1938">
Oxford by-election, 1938

The Oxford by-election, 1938 was a parliamentary by-election for the British House of Commons constituency of Oxford, held on 27 October 1938. The by-election was triggered when Robert Croft Bourne, the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament died on 7 August 1938. He had served as MP for the constituency since a 1924 by-election.
Background.
On 29 September 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had signed the Munich Agreement, handing over the Sudetenland to German control. This issue polarised British politics at the time, with many Labour supporters, Liberals, and some Conservatives strongly opposed to this policy of appeasement. Many by-elections in the autumn of 1938 were fought around this issue, including this one and also the Bridgwater by-election, three weeks later, where Liberals and Labour again united in support of an Independent anti-appeasement candidate.
Candidates.
The Liberal Party had selected Ivor Davies, a 23-year-old graduate of Edinburgh University, despite the fact that he was the candidate for Central Aberdeenshire at the same time. The Labour Party selected Patrick Gordon Walker, who had contested the seat at the 1935 general election.
On 13 September, Davies offered to stand down from the by-election if Labour did the same and backed a Popular Front candidate against the Conservatives. Eventually, Gordon Walker reluctantly stood down and both parties supported Sandy Lindsay, who was the Master of Balliol, as an Independent Progressive. 
On 14 September, the Conservatives selected Quintin Hogg, who was a fellow of All Souls and a former President of the Oxford Union Society.
Campaign.
The campaign was intense and focused almost entirely on foreign affairs. Hogg supported Chamberlain's appeasement policy. Lindsay opposed appeasement; his campaigners used the slogan "A vote for Hogg is a vote for Hitler."
Lindsay was supported by many dissident Conservatives such as Harold Macmillan who were opposed to the Munich Agreement. A number of future politicians such as Edward Heath and Roy Jenkins, at Oxford University at the time, cut their teeth in the Michaelmas campaign.
In popular culture.
A 1988 TV drama-documentary "A Vote for Hitler" dramatized on the events surrounding the by-election, and included interviews with Denis Healey and Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford, who had campaigned for Labour during the election, and Quintin Hogg, by then Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone. Actors played their younger versions and included John Woodvine as Lindsay, and James Coombes as Richard Crossman.
Result.
The intensive campaign caused turnout to increase from 67.3% at the last election to 76.3%. Hogg won the seat with a reduced majority of 3,434 or 12.2%.

Ada Fisher

Ada M. Fisher (born October 21, 1947 in Durham, North Carolina) is a retired physician from Salisbury, North Carolina and a frequent Republican candidate for office. She challenged incumbent Mel Watt in North Carolina's 12th Congressional district in 2004 and 2006. Fisher has said that she would like to be the first black Republican female elected to Congress. 
A life member of the NAACP and a lifelong Republican, Fisher is the Republican National Committeewoman for the state of North Carolina.
Early life and education.
Fisher is the daughter of Rev. Miles Mark Fisher of Durham, North Carolina, himself the son of a former slave and his Seminole Indian wife. Rev. Fisher was also a Republican, as was her grandfather, who was freed by the Emancipation Proclamation when he was 10 years old. Fisher attended Durham public schools, graduating from Hillside High School with honors. She then graduated from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro with a degree in biology.
Fisher went on to earn her medical degree from the University of Wisconsin and a master's in public health from Johns Hopkins University.
Career.
Upon receiving her medical degree, Fisher participated in a residency at the University of Rochester in family medicine. She later ran a rural North Carolina health clinic and a 16-county substance abuse program. In addition, she worked for two Fortune 500 companies, including medical director for Amoco in Chicago. Before retiring in 2000 due to a leg disability, Fisher served as Chief of Occupational Health Services at the W.G. "Bill" Hefner Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Salisbury.
In addition to being a physician, Fisher is licensed as a secondary teacher in mathematics and science.
Elected office.
Fisher is a former member of the board of education for the Rowan–Salisbury School System. In addition, she has served on the boards of trustees of Barber-Scotia College (in Concord) and Preservation NC.
At the 2008 North Carolina Republican Party state convention, held at the Joseph Koury Convention Center in Greensboro, Fisher was elected as the National Republican Committeewoman for North Carolina. Running against the incumbent, establishment candidate Mary Frances Forrester, wife of state Sen. Jim Forrester, Fisher's win was viewed as a surprise, underdog victory. Fisher was re-elected in 2012, again defeating Forrester. 
As of the end of 2008, Fisher was one of only three African Americans on the RNC. She endorsed Katon Dawson for RNC chairman that year. Fisher later called for the winner of the RNC race, Michael S. Steele, to resign after less than two months in office.
Campaigns.
Fisher ran for the United States Senate in 2002 in the Republican primary against Elizabeth Dole, who went on to win the general election; Fisher placed fourth in a field of seven Republican candidates. Fisher protested during the campaign that she was not allowed to participate in television forums featuring only two of the Republican candidates, and after the election, she filed a complaint regarding Dole's residency requirement. She ran against incumbent Congressman Mel Watt of the North Carolina's 12th congressional district in 2004 and 2006. In 2008, she ran for the North Carolina General Assembly from North Carolina's 77th House district. 
In 2004, Watt won with 67% of the vote, with Fisher gaining 60% of the vote in more Republican Davidson County. Fisher raised $400,000 to oppose Watt in 2006, with most of the money spent on direct mail; she said the national Republican Party had not given her "one dime of support," but local organizations were supportive. In 2008, Fisher told Talking Points Memo that the fundraising organization she had hired had given her back only $30,000 of the $400,000 she had raised in the cycle, directing the rest to its affiliated private vendors, in what echoed previous complaints listed at TPM.
In 2006, Fisher claimed that Watt ignored his constituents at the expense of travel related to his chairmanship of the Congressional Black Caucus. Her campaign theme was "Get a Doctor in the House" and she recommended a "prescription" composed of 10 platform planks. Fisher said that she had put 73,000 miles on her car traveling the six counties of the 12th District for her campaign.
Political views.
Fisher has written in "The North Carolina Conservative" that the Republican Party has a long history of black candidates for office, including the first black senator Hiram Revels and the first black congressman, Joseph Rainey, and four of the first six black senators. Fisher continued: "In the rush to find fault while looking for a rightward turn, people forget that it was the Democrats who brought in poll taxes which kept us from voting; were behind the Jim Crow laws which separated us into white and colored; vigorously supported the Ku Klux Klan; and kept us out of their party and from unions and opportunities dictating a say in the course of our lives... The Great Society of Lyndon Johnson took on segregation but, in so doing to some, possibly undermined the social fabric of an independent people in its push for a safety net, which abolished individual responsibility and accountability for behavior and actions."
Fisher has mentioned that George W. Bush has brought a level of diversity to his cabinet "like no other," mentioning Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Rod Paige, and Alphonso Jackson. She noted in 2006, "No administration had previously had more than two African-Americans in such significant Cabinet-level positions."
Fisher supports a flat tax, small businesses ("many of which started in our communities"), gun rights ("which often made a difference in the African-American community's security"), and expanded education options. She opposes gay marriage (once saying, "Marriage ought to be between one man and one woman at one time, and I'm still waiting.") She opposes spending out of the Social Security Trust Fund ("I like the lock box").
She is in favor of tort reform for medical malpractice lawsuits and a free enterprise system of health care: "If you socialize medicine, you will lose the creativity and innovation that brings us new drugs and new treatments. You'll also stifle physician choice and opportunities in medicine."
Fisher does not support open borders for reasons of national security, nor does she support illegal immigration to the United States or language accommodations for driver's licenses for those who do not speak English. She has called President Bush's guest worker proposals "amnesty" that will depress wages for Americans: "It is not correct to say undocumented workers do jobs, which Americans won't do. If these jobs were required to pay minimum wages there are thousands of out of work people who would be glad to fill them. It should not be lost on the American public that the number of unskilled Americans out of work approximates the number of illegal residents in this country. Exploiting illegal residents ultimately depresses wages for everyone." Fisher continued, "As a black woman, I will never support any provision to relax borders with Mexico when we keep turning Haitians away and sending them back to situations we know are equally bad if not worst... granddaughter of a free African boy who was made a slave on reaching these shores and granddaughter of his Seminole Indian wife, I am mad that my peoples were stripped of our cultures and languages to improve this nation and now see others advance with minimum standards set for their citizenship as they become our new underclass."
To stem illegal immigration, Fisher proposes random checks on companies known to hire illegal workers, fines and penalties for companies found guilty, deportation of illegal workers, adoption of tamper-proof photo visas for non-citizens entering the United States. She believes money sent to Mexico to compensate Social Security taxes paid by illegal workers (the Social Security Totalization Agreement) should instead be given to states whose social services are strapped from illegal immigration, and the United States should commence oil drilling in Mexico, helping Mexicans find jobs and business profits while helping to solve the United States' energy needs. Fisher also believes national standards for driver's licenses should be invoked, as well as voter identification cards.
In August 2008, she emailed a link to a YouTube video of rearranged clips of President Barack Obama "indulging the darkest conspiracy theories about himself." She wrote "This tape should be investigated and verified. I am not an expert on tapes but if this isn't doctored we have a constitutional issue of humongous proportions to deal with."
Personal life.
Fisher was never married but adopted two sons, now adults.

Eric Louw

Eric Hendrik Louw (1890-1968) was a South African diplomat and politician. Although a controversial and often undiplomatic figure, he was respected by admirers and critics for his unflinching courage and brilliant wit.
Early life.
He was born in Jacobsdal in the Orange Free State on 21 November 1890 and died in Cape Town on 24 June 1968. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree at the then Victoria College, Stellenbosch. He went on to qualify as an advocate at Rhodes University College; Grahamstown, where he also practised.
In 1915, when his father died at Beaufort West, he took over the business interests.
Politician and diplomat.
In 1924 he was elected Member of Parliament for Beaufort West, and the following year became South Africa's first Trade Commissioner in the U.S.A. and Canada. In 1929 he became High Commissioner in London and a year later South Africa's first envoy in the United States. After he had represented his country in Italy, France and Portugal and had been South Africa's first representative to the League of Nations, he returned to South Africa for political reasons. In 1938 he was again elected Member of Parliament for Beaufort West. During the Second World War he was, like most of his party, pro-Nazi. When the National Party won the general election in 1948, he was an obvious choice for the cabinet, firstly as Minister of Economic Affairs, then, from 1955, as Minister of Finance and from 1957 as Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was best known as South Africa's representative at UNO, Commonwealth and other overseas conferences. Between 1948 and 1962 he represented South Africa at UNO on eight occasions. As Minister of Foreign Affairs he assisted Dr HF Verwoerd at the historic Commonwealth conference in London in 1961 when South Africa withdrew her membership. On 31 December 1963 he relinquished his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Honours and awards.
He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Pretoria in 1962. He was similarly honoured by the University of the Orange Free State in 1963. In 1965 a bronze bust of him by Hennie Potgieter was unveiled at Beaufort West in a school which bore his name until it was amalgamated with Niko Brummer Primary School in 1994. A high school in the town of Musina in Limpopo also bears his name.
