GameAccount

GameAccount Network is an Internet skill gaming network, based in Soho in central London, England.
Since its launch in 2002 it has become the world's largest skill gaming network, with over 2,000,000 players through the online gaming companies William Hill, Gala Coral Eurobet, Paddy Power and Sportingbet plc.
The company's website allows players to chat and play person-to-person games, including backgammon, gin rummy, dominoes and multiplayer blackjack.
History.
The two founders, Dave McDowell and Kevin O'Neal set up the company in 2000 and began working on a multiplayer gaming platform. The company was folded into Cantor Fitzgerald in 2001 and then demerged from that same company in 2002. In October 2002 the independent UK private company GameAccount Global Limited (trading as GameAccount Network) commenced trading. Investment rounds in 2002, 2004, and 2006 brought in a variety of high profile investors such as the Smurfit family, who recently floated the Smurfit Kappa Group packaging multinational, Andrew Black, founder of Betfair, and Dermot Desmond founder of Betdaq.
The founders originally intended the company to monetize popular first person shooter (FPS) games but then settled on online sports games such as golf, pool and darts. Later additions to the early fun game portfolio were a scrabble type game, word-noodle, various solitaire games and blocs. 
In 2005 one of the two founders, Kevin O'Neal, resigned as Chief Executive Officer and the company's direction changed in that games of pure 'skill' (such as pool or blocs) were replaced with games of skill and chance combined such as gin rummy and backgammon. These games proved more successful as, like the online poker phenomenon they appealed to both beginners and professional players. In addition, the company also adopted more of a business to business strategy than the traditional operator or business to consumer route. Major bookmakers were signed up such as William Hill, Sportingbet and Paddy Power on whose sites a new product 'tab' called 'skill' was offered under their branding.
The GameAccount financial transaction platform allowed bookmaker clients to use the same account for the skill games as for all of their sports, casino and poker products.
More bookmakers were added in 2007-8 including Gala Coral Group, Boylesports, Bluesquare and Stanjames. 
In 2005, the company was awarded the industry's Award for Innovation for their Tournament Blackjack (person-to-person) game by egaming review.
In 2006 the second of the two founders, David McDowell, resigned as Chief Operating Officer but continued to serve on the Board of Directors through to 2012 as a non-executive director.
In 2007, GameAccount became one of the very first UK gaming operators and suppliers to be licensed by the new UK Gambling Commission and operates as a software supplier to the gambling industry under this licence. In the same year they also received an Associate certificate from the Alderney Gaming Commission. In April GameAccount launched its first Casino Table Games including Roulette and Blackjack.
In 2008, Nigel Payne, previously CEO of Sportingbet joined the GameAccount Network board as Chairman. The Company re-branded as GameAccount Network and moved to larger premises in the West End of London. GameAccount also launched the Italian Skill Games Network on 29 September 2008, with SNAI S.p.A. as its first licensee for regulated online Skill Games in the newly regulated Italian market.
In 2009, David Hudd re-joined the GameAccount Network board as Chairman replacing Nigel Payne who stepped down in September 2009. David Hudd is currently a director of several companies in the UK and the chairman of publicly listed Falkland Island Holdings Plc. On 23 November 2009 GameAccount Network launched tournament-based Skill Games for Lottomatica.
In 2010, GameAccount Network launched its first Italian cultural game Briscola and readied its 'true multiplayer' gaming platform for commercial launch offering true multiplayer cash games for Three Card Brag.
In May 2011, GameAccount Network won the Skill Games Supplier of the Year Award from eGaming Review Magazine.
In 2011, GameAccount Network launched the first in a series of online 'ports' or conversions of offline, land-based machine casino slot games manufactured by global casino slot game manufacturer Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX: ALL). Aristocrat's USA subsidiary Aristocrat Technologies, Inc. subsequently partnered with GameAccount Network in order to offer an online platform solution to its 200+ land-based casinos in the USA in preparation for expected USA online gaming regulation. By year-end 2011 GameAccount Network had delivered several Aristocrat casino slot games into the online regulated market in Europe including 50 Lions, Queen of the Nile and More Chilli, playable for fun or for real money.
In 2012, GameAccount Network launched the "nLive" branded Internet Gaming solution in partnership with Aristocrat Technologies, Inc with the first website MyLiveOnlineCasino.com launching May 2012 in support of the Cordish Company's Maryland Live casino property in Arundel Mills which opened its doors in June 2012. The website offered Poker, Tables, Skill Games and Slots. In November 2012 Aristocrat Leisure Limited announced they acquired a version of the nLive software platform from GameAccount Network and in March 2013 MyLiveOnlineCasino.com was re-launched on Aristocrat's proprietary nLive platform offering Aristocrat slots and a selection of Table Games.
In September 2012, GameAccount Network delivered Scientific Games' first casino slot (Crown Jewels) online into Italy's regulated Internet gaming market followed by games from Aristocrat and IGT in early 2013 for major sports betting and gaming operators such as SNAI, Lottomatica and Eurobet Italia.
In 2013, GameAccount Network announced a partnership in the United States with Foxwoods Resort & Casino, North America's largest casino property, to bring virtual currency based Internet gaming to their already heavily trafficked website Foxwoods.com in advance of real money regulated Internet gaming.
In 2013, GameAccount announced the extension and expansion of their 2.5year-standing platform provision agreement with Rank Group Plc, one of the UK's largest land-based casino and bingo hall operators, to continue serving as their platform for Internet Gaming in Spain's newly regulated Internet gaming market (regulated June 2012) and expanding into the provision of casino slots (expected Q4 2013) and more table games and mobile gaming applications as well as Bingo and Poker. Rank Group Plc is one of Spain's largest Bingo hall operators with in excess of 2m customer visits, annually.
US legisation.
In October 2006, after the USA Government introduced the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 to prohibit online gaming in the USA, GameAccount Network closed all accounts opened by USA residents despite providing only games of pure skill for free in tournament formats.
Legal controversy.
In 2006 Gameaccount became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with former business partner Cantor Fitzgerald. An agreement from 2002 prohibited Gameaccount from using software developed within Cantor for use with third party bookmakers. Gameaccount agreed to compensation for use of a golf game in conjunction with bookmakers and agreed to submit to damages. This, was, however, considered unsatisfactory to Cantor Fitzgerald who sued for copyright infringement for other parts of the system. The dispute was eventually settled in 2007 and in his judgement, Daniel Alexander found that a Cantor database that was still on the Gameaccount servers, though not used was still technically in breach of copyright. He noted that "Although it wasn't actually performing the function for which it was designed (i.e. as a full-function database), GA Money was stored, backed up, reproduced in part and regularly regularly accessed in order to perform the limited function for which Gameaccount used it between 2004, following its arrangements with UKBetting, and 2006. Much of this case revolved around various interpretations of the words 'use' and 'copy', especially in the context of databases. Effectively, the ruling suggests that to have a dormant database sitting on servers does still constitute usage and copying.
Acquisitions, partners, and brands.
In addition to the gaming network supplying bookmakers, Gameaccount also operates a number of smaller consumer facing brands such as Casinorip.com and worldgammon.com. In 2004, the company acquired the URL and customer assets of treasuregames.com, and in 2008 the company acquired the same for a large backgammon site called gamesgrid.com. In 2010, the company acquired certain assets previously held by The Moneygaming Corporation Limited trading as MoneyGaming.com and relaunched MoneyGaming.com on 19 January 2010 as a member of the GameAccount Network. MoneyGaming.com is now the only business-to-consumer website operated by GameAccount, with GameAccount.com having been closed and redirected to MoneyGaming.com in January 2013.

Sesame Street characters

A wide variety of characters have appeared on the American children's television series "Sesame Street". A large number of the characters are Muppets, which are puppets made in Jim Henson's distinctive puppet-creation style. Most of the non-Muppet characters are human characters, but there are a few characters that are animated.
Muppets.
The Muppets are a group of puppet characters created by Jim Henson, many for the purpose of appearing on the classic children's television program "Sesame Street". Henson's involvement in "Sesame Street" began when he and Joan Ganz Cooney, one of the creators of the show, met in the summer of 1968, at one of the show's five three-day curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that director Jon Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should "make do without puppets".
Henson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join "Sesame Street" for social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the "Sesame Street" Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the Children's Television Workshop, the series' non-profit producer. The Muppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention. In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. The Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were stereotypical and predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.
During the production of "Sesame Street's" first season, producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show's appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material. Not intended for broadcast, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969. The results were "generally very positive"; children learned from the shows, their appeal was high, and children's attention was sustained over the full hour. However, the researchers found that although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the "Street" segments, when no Muppets were on screen. This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target.
The Street scenes were "the glue" that "pulled the show together", so producers knew they needed to make significant changes. The producers decided to reject the advisers' advice and reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors, specifically Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird, who became two of the show's most enduring characters. These test episodes were directly responsible for what writer Malcolm Gladwell called "the essence of "Sesame Street"—the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults".
Since 2001, the full rights for Muppets created for "Sesame Street" have been owned by the Sesame Workshop, as the CTW was renamed in 2000.
Human characters.
Since the premiere of the children's television program "Sesame Street" on November 10, 1969, it has included what writer Malcolm Gladwell has called "the essence of "Sesame Street"—the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults". The original cast, chosen by producer Jon Stone, consisted of four human actors—Matt Robinson, who played Gordon, Loretta Long, who played Gordon's wife Susan, Will Lee (Mr. Hooper), and Bob McGrath (Bob). Unlike most children television programs at the time, the producers of "Sesame Street" decided against using a single host and cast a group of ethnically diverse actors, with, as "Sesame Street" researcher Gerald S. Lesser put it, "a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities".
Stone did not audition actors until Spring 1969, a few weeks before five shows, designed to test the show's appeal to children, and to examine their comprehension of the material, were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and researcher Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the "most enthusiastic thumbs up" were cast. For example, when the children saw Long's audition, they stood up and sang along with her rendition of "I'm a Little Teapot". As Stone said, casting was the only aspect of the show that was "just completely haphazard". Most of the cast and crew found jobs on "Sesame Street" through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers.
According to CTW researchers Shalom M. Fisch and Lewis Bernstein, the results of the test shows, which were never intended for broadcast and presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969, were "generally very positive". They found that children learned from the shows, that the show's appeal was high, and that children's attention was sustained over the full hour. However, the researchers found that although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the "Street" segments, when no Muppets were on screen. The producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused, and had recommended that human actors and Muppets not be shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than they would have liked.
Palmer referred to the Street scenes as "the glue" that "pulled the show together", so producers knew they needed to make significant changes, including defying the recommendations of their advisers. Lesser called this decision "a turning point in the history of "Sesame Street"". The producers went back and reshot the Street segments; Muppet creator Jim Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors.
On August 14, 2012, Sesame Street announced it is hold a casting call for a new Hispanic character for the show’s 44th season.
Animated characters.
Some of the animated characters on "Sesame Street" are animated versions of Muppet characters. Others appear only in animated segments.

Denton Designs

Denton Designs was a British video games developer based in Liverpool. The company was founded in 1984 and initially specialised in developing software for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum home computer. Amongst the founders were developers who had worked on the unfinished 'Mega game' "Bandersnatch" for Imagine Software.
History.
Denton Designs was founded in September 1985 following the collapse of Imagine Software. Six Imagine staff - Steve Cain, Ian Weatherburn, Ally Noble, John Gibson, Karen Davies and Graham "Kenny" Everitt - made redundant by the company's demise, founded the new software house and carried on where they had left off at Imagine.
When Denton Designs was contracted to develop Shadowfire, Ian Weatherburn became disillusioned with the fact that the company was no longer operating as it had when they had been part of Imagine, and on providing an ultimatum was sacked by the rest of the directors. He subsequently joined Ocean. 
In March 1986, the company split, with founders Cain, Davis, Everitt and Gibson leaving to join Ian Weatherburn in setting up a new software house. Only Ally Noble of the original founders remained. 
In December 1995, Denton Designs was acquired by Rage Software.

Prior to his innovation, inducted celebrities were either given only a small-engraved plaque or nothing at all.
At that time, the Hollywood Chamber directors Johnny Grant and Bill Welsh immediately fell in love with the “NEW” representation of Hollywood. After creating various depictions of exactly what would work for the prestigious ceremony, the Chamber signed an exclusive contract with Carmine to recreate the Walk of Fame star for the Hollywood Chamber in perpetuity.
His company “Gift of Fame Enterprises” has provided a lift to the revitalization of Hollywood with thousands of gratified customers as well as the many charities to whom he has donated.

The single "Don't Make Waves", taken from the album and released in April 1980, reached number 12 on the UK charts. In mid-1980, Anne left the group and Coleen became an official member of the group, and recorded the remainder of the songs with them for "Making Waves", including "Gotta Pull Myself Together," which would later take the No.9 spot on the UK charts.
The album was released in October 1980, and tracks "Who's Gonna Rock You" and "Attention to Me" went on to be released from the album, both of them becoming UK top 20 hits. The album was a similar success, peaking at No.11 and spending 33 weeks in the charts, their longest run in the UK. It was certified gold by the BPI for sales of over 100,000. The album reached No.1 in Japan - their biggest market, where it was released as 恋のハッピー・デート ("Happy Dating Love"). It became the ninth biggest-selling album of 1981 there. In Australia, the album was released with an earlier single "I'm in the Mood for Dancing" included, which also featured on the Japanese version, replacing "Sexy Music", which instead was the title track to their next album (a compilation). In Australia the album was a success, being awarded double platinum.
The songs were produced separately by two producers, Ben Findon, who was responsible for the pop-orientated tracks like "Gotta Pull Myself Together" and "Attention to Me", while Nicky Graham produced the more disco-themed songs such as "Who's Gonna Rock You" and "Lead Me On". Significant other songs included "Touch Me in the Morning", a cover of the Diana Ross hit and "Sexy Music", which was released as a single in Japan after winning the 1981 Tokyo Music Festival.
The album was re-released on Compact disc in June 2009 by Cherry Red Records in a double-pack with their previous album.

Resupination

Resupination generally means being upside-down, supine, facing upward. The word is derived from the Latin. In a biological context, the concept is commonly expressed with the adjectives "resupinate" or "non-resupinate."
Examples in green plants.
Structures in a green plant will sometimes twist around from their original positions into a resupinate form.
Alstroemeriaceae.
The genera "Bomarea" and Alstroemeria often exhibit resupinate leaves.
Orchidaceae.
In the family Orchidaceae, the flower tepals typically comprise three sepals and three petals. One petal, called the lip or "labellum", is typically quite different from the other two and comes from the same direction of the flower as the stigmatic surface. As an orchid flower bud develops, the lip is usually uppermost; in most cases, the flower stem twists to present the lip pointing down by the time the flower opens. That is, most orchid flowers are resupinate. Because resupination is the most common condition in orchid flowers, the lack of resupination is notable; flowers which do not exhibit resupination are described as "non-resupinate."
Examples in fungi.
In fungi, the term "resupinate" describes a fruiting body consisting of a fertile surface adnate to the substrate. Certain genera such as "Peniophora" are notable for many of their species being resupinate.

William Shaw (Irish politician)

William Shaw (4 May 1823 – 19 September 1895) was an Irish Protestant nationalist politician. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and one of the founders of the Irish home rule movement.
Born in Moy, County Tyrone, Shaw was connected with the Young Ireland movement, and studied at Trinity College, Dublin without taking a degree. He then studied theology at Highbury College in Middlesex. He served as a Minister at an independent church in Cork from 1846 to 1850, then married and left his post to move into business.
Shaw stood as a Liberal Party candidate in Bandon, at the 1865 by-election and subsequent general election, but was defeated on both occasions. He stood in the same seat at the 1868 general election, and was elected as an independent Liberal. While generally supportive of William Ewart Gladstone, he became active in the new Home Government Association, and in 1873, he presided over the convention held to found its successor, the Home Rule League.
At the 1874 general election, Shaw was elected unopposed for County Cork, and with Mitchell Henry, often deputised for Home Rule Party leader Isaac Butt. He remained loyal to Butt, and when Butt died in 1879, Shaw was selected as the new party chairman.
Shaw held his seat at the 1880 general election, but lost an election for the party chairmanship, to Charles Stewart Parnell. Parnell distanced the Home Rule League from the Liberal Party, but Shaw continued to sit on the Liberal benches in the House of Commons, and was appointed to the Bessborough Commission to examine Irish land tenure. Shaw opposed the Irish Land League, formally left the Irish party group in early 1881, and resigned from the moribund Home Rule League in December.
Shaw devoted increasing amounts of his time to his chairmanship of the Munster Bank, and did not stand for Parliament at the 1885 general election. Later in the year, the Munster Bank collapsed, and Shaw was declared personally bankrupt. He moved to London and worked with various newspapers in the last years of his life.

Resolution and Independence

"Resolution and Independence" is a lyric poem by the English romantic poet William Wordsworth, composed in 1802 and published in 1807 in "Poems in Two Volumes". The poem contains twenty stanzas written in modified rhyme royal, and describes Wordworth’s encounter with a leech-gatherer near his home in the Lake District of England.
Overview.
Stanzas I-III of the poem describe the poet's joy while taking a morning walk after a night of rain. 
In stanzas IV-VII, the poet is suddenly beset by anxious thoughts and fears about his own future, as well as the future of all poets, saying "We Poets in our youth begin in gladness; / But thereof come in the end despondency and madness." In Stanza VII, Wordsworth recounts past poets who died at a young age. In line 43, he "thought of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy / The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride", referring to Thomas Chatterton, an 18th-century poet who committed suicide at the age of 17 after duping many in the literary world with his medieval forgeries. In line 45, Wordsworth writes "of Him who walked in glory and in joy / Following his plough, along the mountain-side", a reference to Robert Burns, who died at the age of 37 after an extended illness.
The poem concludes in stanzas VIII-XX with Wordsworth meeting an old, poor leech-gatherer who endures the hardships of his life with patience and acceptance. The poet recovers from his dejection, and views the man as having been sent "To give me human strength, by apt admonishment".
History and background.
The poem is based on Wordsworth’s actual encounter with a leech-gatherer on 3 October 1800, near his home at Dove Cottage in Grasmere. However, the poem was not written until May 1802, when Wordsworth experienced the "despondency" described in the poem while walking on Barton Fell near Ullswater. It was during this walk that he " the emotion in tranquility" and associated the leech-gatherer he had met two years earlier with his current experience. The first version of the poem was written between 3–9 May 1802 under the title of "The Leech-Gatherer", but Wordsworth considerably revised the poem during the following months after it was reviewed by his fiancée, Mary Hutchinson, and her sister Sara.
Parody.
In the 1871 novel "Through the Looking-Glass", Lewis Carroll parodies "Resolution and Independence" with the poem "Haddocks' Eyes".

Shaving horse

Shave horses (shaving horse, shaving bench) are a combination of vice and workbench, used for green woodworking. A foot-actuated clamp holds the work piece securely against pulling forces, especially as when shaped with a drawknife or spokeshave.
As the name "horse" suggests, the worker sits astride the shaving horse. The clamp is operated by the operator pressing their feet onto a treadle bar below.
Typical usage of the shaving horse is to create a round profile along a square piece, such as for a chair leg or to prepare a workpiece for the pole lathe.
They are used in crafts such as coopering and bowyery.
Construction.
The typical clamp is a vertical bar or bars, hinged on a pivot attached to or passing through the bench/seat top. The top of this bar is enlarged into the "horse" -, "dog" - or "dumb" head, the part that holds the wood. Some clamps are worked via string or rope, rather than mechanical leverage.
For extra precision and better clamping force, the clamp pivot point may be raised above the bench level on a sub-bench, giving more leverage. These so-called "Black Forest" or German and Swiss shave horses (as pictured) give a longer lever-ratio, creating greater mechanical advantage and thus greater force to trap the wood very securely.
Shave-horses are commonly workshop-made by their user and entirely wooden, though modern screws, washers, metal sleeves and threaded bolts, with locking nuts are a very welcome and practical innovation, allowing re-tightening or capability to be knocked-down as necessary.
For the itinerant bodgers, simplicity and lightness of their tools was important- thus the bodger often created their shave horse from found logs in their woodland plot.
The provides a rapid clamp and sturdy clamp, which allows the operator to use their legs and upper body weight as additional "power" for work. It is considered by some to result in less fatigue, than generated by constantly standing.
Usage.
The shavehorse is commonly used as the preparation of stock prior to turning in a lathe, to roughly form cylindrical billets, the intermediate dressing phase between a crudely dressed raw split log and the final lathe work.
Shaving green wood with the drawknife or spokeshave "along" the grain is far quicker and easier work than turning "across" it. Skilled operators can produce very fine results with a drawknife and shavehorse, requiring minimal lathe finishing.
Safety.
Though in danger of stating the obvious, it should be stressed: using a circular saw on while straddling the shave horse is highly dangerous and should not be performed under any circumstances.
Straddling the shave horse whilst irresponsibly using any dangerous tool will result in the operator suffering serious bodily injury.
Contrary View of Shave Horses in Actual Practice.
Mike Dunbar, the "Dean of Windsor Chair Makers" (Craig Stevens, Editor, Woodworkers Resource (http://www.woodworkersresource.com) has posted a blog decrying the use of the shave horse for actual production work. "I do not use a shave horse. When asked why, I answer, “Why would I impose a pay cut on myself?” That is in effect the result of using this tool. It is so limiting that it slows down the chairmaker and costs him income. I prefer a vise. Using a vise I am standing, not sitting, and I am far more productive and efficient. I work far faster, using less energy." The full blog entry can be found here: http://thewindsorinstitute.com/blog/?m=201211.

Aar (Lahn)

The Aar is a river in western Germany, left tributary of the Lahn. It rises in the Taunus mountains, near Taunusstein. It flows generally north through the towns Taunusstein, Bad Schwalbach, Aarbergen and Hahnstätten. It flows into the Lahn in Diez.
Name.
The name Aar is a common name of rivers and brooks in German-speaking Central Europe, as exemplified by the similarly named tributary to the same Lahn river Aar (Dill). The pre-German word Aar means "quick-flowing water", in a metaphorical sense "small river in a space between mountains". It is commonly conserved in southern German-speaking areas in settlement names ending with -ach.
Course.
The Aar has its source in the Hessian Taunus south of Limes, 500 meters from the ruins of Roman Castle Zugmantel and the Bundesstraße 417 in the Orlen part of Taunusstein. It flows first to the South, and then in a wide valley running in a southwesternly direction through Neuhof, Wehen, Hahn (all in Taunusstein) and Bleidenstadt. After Bleidenstadt the valley narrows, and the Aar reaches its southernmost point and turns to the northwest. In Bad Schwalbach its only nameworthy left tributary, Nesselbach, enters into it, and it reaches the town's Adolfseck area. Shortly thereafter it crosses the Limes. Below the Burg Hohenstein it passes by the town of the same name and above Michelbach it becomes the border river with Rheinland-Pfalz for a few kilometers. In Aarbergen the river then flows by Michelbach and Kettenbach and takes in its most significant tributary, the 15 kilometer Aubach (historical name: Strinzbach), which has its source quite close to the Aar, just north of the Limes. Thereafter the valley leads to Hausen über Aar and to the last Hessian town, Rückershausen. After crossing the bundesland border, the Aar runs through about 14 km of Rheinland-Pfalz, touching on the towns Schiesheim, Zollhaus and Hahnstätten, Oberneisen, Niederneisen and Flacht. With the townships of Holzheim and Freiendiez it reaches Diez and enters the Lahn.

Köhler theory

Köhler theory describes the process in which water vapor condenses and forms liquid cloud drops, and is based on equilibrium thermodynamics. It combines the Kelvin effect, which describes the change in saturation vapor pressure due to a curved surface, and Raoult's Law, which relates the saturation vapor pressure to the solute. It is an important process in the field of cloud physics. It was initially published in 1936 by Hilding Köhler, Professor of Meteorology in the Uppsala University.
Köhler equation:
formula_1
where formula_2 is the droplet water vapor pressure, formula_3 is the corresponding saturation vapor pressure over a flat surface, formula_4 is the droplet surface tension, formula_5 is the density of pure water, formula_6 is the moles of solute, formula_7 is the molecular weight of water, and formula_8 is the cloud drop diameter.
Köhler curve.
The Köhler curve is the visual representation of the Köhler equation. It shows the supersaturation at which the cloud drop is in equilibrium with the environment over a range of droplet diameters. The exact shape of the curve is dependent upon the amount and composition of the solute. The Köhler curves where the solute is sodium chloride are different from when the solute is sodium nitrate or ammonium sulfate.
The figure above shows three Köhler curves of sodium chloride. Consider a point on the graph where the wet diameter is 0.1 micrometers and the supersaturation is 0.35%. Since the relative humidity is above 100%, the droplet will grow until it is in thermodynamic equilibrium. As the droplet grows, it never encounters equilibrium, and thus grows without bound. However, if the supersaturation is only 0.3%, the drop will only grow until about 0.5 micrometers. The supersaturation at which the drop will grow without bound is called the critical supersaturation. The diameter at which the curve peaks is called the critical diameter.

Pedro Porter Casanate

Admiral Pedro Porter y Casanate (April 30, 1611 – February 27, 1662) was a Spanish sailor, soldier, explorer of California and Royal Governor of Chile from 1656 to 1662.
Early life.
Porter was born in Zaragoza, the second son of Juan Porter and Esperanza Casanate. In 1627, he joined the Spanish Navy, and under Admiral Fadrique de Toledo participated in the expedition against La Rochelle. The year after, he joined the fleet of Admiral Francisco de Vallecilla, charged with protecting the silver galleons from pirate attacks. In 1629, he travelled to the new world for the first time, to fight against the British that had occupied the islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis, taking part in several conflicts in his time and in numerous naval expeditions in the Indies, as a consequence of which he was promoted to alférez in 1631, and sea captain in 1634. The same year, he published his first book on naval themes, the "Correction to mistakes of the Spanish navigation" ().
Later he would become an admiral of the South Seas fleet. He was knight of the Order of Santiago.
Explorations.
In 1635, he applied for and got from the Viceroy of New Spain marquis de Cerralvo a license to explore California, a territory that although located within the borders of the Spanish Empire was unknown whether it was an island or peninsula. Nonetheless, problems and suspicions about his intentions led to the confiscation of his ships. In 1636, he tried again, this time with the license and economic sponsorship of Viceroy marquis de Cadereyta
In 1643 king Philip IV relieved him from his position in the Navy, ordering him to explore California. That same year he left from Cadiz for Cartagena de Indias, from where he left for Veracruz, and crossing the continent he arrived on the west coast of Mexico; where he would remain until 1649, exploring and colonizing the area of the Gulf of California.
Considered as an expert in naval matters, his treatises were appreciated at the time. Among them were: "Diccionario náutico", "Hidrografía general", "Arte de navegar".
Governor of Chile.
In 1656 he was designated as governor of the Kingdom of Chile, in whose functions he took part in the Arauco War against the Mapuche. During his government he founded the fortress of "San Miguel Arcángel de Colcura", built southeast of the modern city of Lota on the site of the old Fort Colcura in the valley of Colcura. He would remain in this position until his death in 1662 in Concepción.

Los Freddy's

Los Freddy's (or Los Freddys) were a Mexican musical group, founded in 1962 in Guadalajara, Jalisco.
The group was one of the most popular Mexican ensembles of the 1960s and 1970s. Early in their careers, the group earned popularity by playing cover songs of popular English-language songs (such as Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs' "Wooly Bully" and The Beatles' "Penny Lane") that were translated into Spanish, as well as producing original romantic ballads. The band established themselves throughout Latin America as one of the top bands with a string of successful slow ballads and grupera songs. They were nominated for a Grammy Award in 1989. In 1994, lead singer Arturo Cisneros left the band to pursue a solo career and now performs under his own name. The remaining band members continue together with a new lead singer. A compilation album of the group's 30 greatest hits released in 2003 produced a resurgence of the group's popularity, earning the album a spot on the Billboard charts in the United States.
Beginnings.
In 1962, five high-school friends from a small town of San Andres, a suburb of Guadalajara, State of Jalisco, Mexico, united their incipient musical skills to form a group called The Freddy Boys that would eventually become one of most Mexico's most popular bands and influential in the development of spanish music across latin america for the next 30 years. The Freddy Boys began with José Luis Tapia Coronado (guitar), his brother Fernando Tapia Coronado (bass guitar), Ricardo (vocals), Artemio Chávez (requinto - high pitched version guitar) y Valentín Terrones (drums).
Turmoil in the End.
In an interview with morning radio host Pepe Reyes (La Preciosa Network, Clear Channel Radio), lead singer Arturo Cisneros announced he officially left the band on August 29, 1994. Cisneros stated that he began recording for an undisclosed record label as a solo artist in the following months and by January 1995 had completed 5 solo albums. In 1997, Cisneros formed his own version of los Freddy's (Arturo Cisneros Y sus Freddy's) with three former members of the original Freddy's: Octavio Aguilar, Raziel de Lugo & Ruperto Lopez.

Polybus (Odyssey)

In Ancient Greek epic tradition recounted in Homer's "Odyssey", Polybus was the father of a suitor, Eurymachus, who was killed by Odysseus once he returned from his 10-year journey during the Trojan War. Polybus himself was one of the suitors of Penelope, the wife of Odysseus. Polybus was actually described as wise, contradictory to his foolish son. In Book XXII of the Odyssey, after Odysseus and Telemachus had slain most of the suitors, only six remained: Agelaus, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus, Peisander and Polybus. The aforementioned Agelaus tried rousing the men to throw their spears collectively at the avengers, but Athena guided them elsewhere. Polybus was killed by the spear of the swineherd Eumeaus.

The Echo Label discography

The following is a list of music releases on The Echo Label. As of 2008, the label will no longer be acting as a record company, so the following list can be seen as complete. 
The most successful artists on their roster were Feeder, Moloko and Babybird, Moloko became the only artist of theirs to achieve a number one album anywhere in the world, when "Statues" reached that position in Flanders. They are also the only artist to get an IFPI sales award when the album passed 500,000 units in Europe, certifying it gold and the first artist of theirs to get a UK platinum certification by the BPI when their previous album "Things to Make and Do" reached the required 300,000 unit shipments in 2000, and took six months from the release date to do so. Feeder on the other hand became the only artist on the Echo roster to gain two platinum awards in the UK when "Comfort in Sound" and "Echo Park" both picked up the sales certificates in 2003, they later went on in 2006 to pick up their third when "The Singles" became the first Echo album to go platinum in less than three months- the first quarter of the album's debut year from its release date. Although Moloko had the highest-placed single in the UK charts when "The Time is Now" made number two in 2000 (kept off the top spot by Melanie C and Lisa Left-Eye Lopes with "Never Be the Same Again"), Feeder arguably have the most well-known single release on Echo's roster. "Buck Rogers" reached number five in January 2001, making it their first ever top 10 single and has over the years become an XFM and UK summer music festival anthem. Feeder have now formed their own label Big Teeth Music for domestic releases, and are still signed to their Japanese label Victor. Moloko on the other hand split in 2006. Their first artist on the label to achieve gold sales was that of Babybird for their album "Ugly Beautiful" in 1996, while its signature single "You're Gorgeous" became the only ever single on the label to gain gold sales, when it passed the required 400,000 in the UK. The only other certified singles are Moloko's "Sing it Back" and "The Time Is Now", both of which have been certified Silver, marking sales of 200,000.
The Echo numbering system.
Nearly all Echo releases start with the prefix "EC" with a following "H" for albums and an "S" for singles, though due to the number of formats for each release, each different media has additional characters in the catalogue number.
This is the format used for each different type of media:

Demo 98

Demo 98 is the first demo and release by the Blackened death metal band Crionics. The demo is actually named Demo 98 and the cover on the right is the original cover that goes with the demo. Featuring only a calm winter nature photo, without the title and the original "Crionics" logo which they are still using today on their releases.
Yanuary made his first appearance on this demo, but left the band later on. He came back to Crionics after a couple of years although not as the guitarist, but as the bassist. A year after the band was formed, they recorded five songs. However, this material never saw the light because of its bad production. About six months later after they recorded the songs, the band decided to record a four-song "Demo 98". This is that same demo featuring four song of the original five songs they recorded. Because of the poor equipment the material wasn’t exactly perfect, but the band decided to promote it anyway. They played a few shows and started looking for a keyboardist that would enhance their sound. Vac-V was the man that quickly became the missing link in their music and the band's music started to sound more interesting and complete at their shows. He joined the band later on and made its first appearance on their next release and first EP, Beyond the Blazing Horizon.

Max Greenberg

Max "Big Maxie" Greenberg (1883–1933) was an American bootlegger and organized crime figure in Detroit, Michigan and later as a member of Egan's Rats in St. Louis. He oversaw the purchasing of sacramental wine from Orthodox rabbis, then allowed under the Volstead Act, which were sold to bootleggers in the St. Louis-Kansas City, Missouri area during Prohibition. He was also associated with mobsters in this particular method of acquiring illegal liquor including Waxey Gordon, Meyer Lansky and Arnold Rothstein. 
By the early 1910s, Max Greenberg had joined the Egan's Rats and become one of their best members. Max, his brother Morris, and two others were suspected in the murder of Sam Mintz on December 5, 1914. It was disclosed that Mintz had informed on the boys in an arson/insurance scam they were running. Greenberg managed to beat the rap. Max Greenberg was also believed to have played a key role in the Rats' first known bank robbery, that of the Baden Bank on April 10, 1919. The take was $59,000. 
Soon after the Baden bank heist, Max Greenberg, Ben Milner, and Edward "Big Red" Powers were sentenced to Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary on an interstate theft charge, stemming from the Egan-sponsored robbery of some railroad cars in Danville, Illinois. Egan gang boss William Egan and Missouri State Senator Michael Kinney managed to finagle the three men pardons from none other than President Woodrow Wilson himself. 
Soon after their release, Max Greenberg and Ben Milner decided to go into the bootlegging racket for themselves. They accomplished this by betraying the very same man who had saved them from prison; Willie Egan. Egan gave Greenberg $2,000 to make a deal with a Mexican smuggler for a load of whiskey. Max, it later turned out, paid the smuggler but kept the booze for himself. Egan was furious and demanded that Greenberg reimburse him, but Maxie claimed the whiskey barge had sunk in the Mississippi River. These bad feelings came to a head in the early morning hours of October 16, 1920, when Greenberg and his pals engaged the rest of the Egan's Rats in a huge brawl at Willie Egan's Franklin Avenue saloon. One of the men severely injured was attorney John Sweeney. A month later, Ben Milner would be shot and killed during a running gun battle with the Russo Gang. After these two incidents his bootleg business fell into disarray, forcing Max Greenberg to leave St. Louis for Detroit. 
In the fall of 1920, he was introduced to Rothstein by Waxey Gordon and asked for a $175,000 loan to purchase speedboats to bring in alcohol from Ontario to Detroit as well as additional funds for graft payoffs. Rothstein liked the idea, but instead decided to apply rumrunning to New York where the demand was the highest demand in the country. Gordon was allowed to run the operation as a junior partner while Greenberg, in order not to be cut out entirely, was allowed to take part in the deal under the condition that he mortgage all his personal property to Rothstein and take out an expensive life insurance policy with Rothstein's insurance company.
In March 1921, Greenberg returned to St. Louis to lay the groundwork for his new business. Willie Egan gave Max one last chance to account for the missing whiskey. The two, along with John Sweeney and an unidentified man, met at the corner of Sixth and Chestnut streets in downtown St. Louis on March 11, 1921. Greenberg refused to pay once again. As the meet broke up, a lone gunman appeared out of the shadows and started shooting. Sweeney was killed and Max Greenberg was shot through the jaw. Despite the severity of his wounds, Maxie survived. In the wake of this attempt on his life, Greenberg formed an alliance with the rival Hogan Gang.
The Egan's Rats would steadfastly believe that Max Greenberg was the driving force behind the murder of Willie Egan, who was gunned down in front of his saloon on October 31, 1921. It was said that Greenberg paid the three shooters $10,000 each for the hit. During the ensuing gang war, new Egan boss Dint Colbeck made getting Greenberg a top priority. After Monsignor Timothy Dempsey negotiated a truce between the Egan and Hogan gangs in June 1922, several armed Hogan gangsters escorted Max Greenberg onto a New York-bound train. 
Returning to New York City, Max and Gordon then began leasing a fleet motorboats and trucks which brought in bonded whiskey and scotch from Rothstein's contacts in Canada and Great Britain. Their rum running system protected by Rothstein's payoffs to certain members of the U.S. Coast Guard as well as police and local politicians in Long Island and the Jersey Shore, the alcohol would be delivered to high-class hotels in Manhattan among Rothstein's clientele. The bootlegging operation became one of the biggest and most successful in the country for five years until September 1925 when Prohibition agents seized one of their ships off Astoria, Long Island. Greenberg and Gordon were arrested with 13 others a month later and charged with conspiracy to violate prohibition laws.
He later went to New Jersey where, in July 1929, he formed a bootlegging cartel with Waxey Gordon and Max Hassel. Greenberg managed Gordon's vast real estate, hotel and gambling interests while Gordon's muscle and Hassel's experience and political connections made a formidable alliance and their operation eventually became the largest producer of real beer in the New York-Philadelphia area. By 1933, the three owned at least 16 or 17 breweries stretching from Buffalo, Elmira and Syracuse, New York to eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland according to the US government. They also controlled smaller unlicensed breweries known as "cold water" or "wild cats".
Greenberg and his partners began to come under pressure to join the Italian-Jewish criminal syndicate controlled by Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky. They also began receiving threats from rival Dutch Schultz. On the afternoon of April 12, 1933, Greenberg and Gordon were scheduled to meet with Hassel at his suite on the eighth floor of the Carteret Hotel in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Between 2:30 and 4:00 pm, taxi driver George Hickman told police he drove Greenberg and two other unidentified men from the hotel to the Harrison brewery. He then drove them back to the Carteret where he saw Greenberg entered the building. The two men who were with him stayed outside for a few moments before following him inside. Although these men remained unidentified, it was suggested they may have been Greenberg's bodyguards who were making sure no one followed their boss up to Hassel's hotel room. This was supported by the hotel barber who said Greenberg waved to him as he entered the hotel at 4:10 pm. A second theory developed by police suggested that Greenberg never left the hotel at all as hotel employees claimed his bulletproof sedan was not taken out of the hotel garage that day. Investigators found it unlikely that Greenberg would risk taking a taxi, and without his regular bodyguard, knowing that his life may have been in danger.
Shortly after the meeting started, Gordon left his partners and walked down the hall where he claimed to have entered the room of a young lady, 22-year-old mob prostitute Nancy Presser, with whom he spent the rest of the afternoon. He admitted he had talked to some men after leaving the meeting, but police did not release their names. Lou Parkowitz was also present the room and left when the participants began discussing serious matters. He was the last to see Greenberg and Hassel alive as, several minutes later, he returned to the room after hearing gunfire and found both men had been shot to death. Parkowitz claimed that he had passed several men running past him as he hurried back to the room. Entering the room, Parkowitz discovered Hassel's body laying face down near the office doorway while Greenberg was slumped over a closed rolltop desk shot five times in the chest and head.
Frankie Carbo, a gunman for Murder Incorporated, was later charged with the murders of Greenberg, Hassel and Gordan following his arrest in 1935. He spent six months in jail before the case was dropped. Joseph Stassi claimed that Meyer Lansky, Abner "Abe" Zwillman and Joe Adonis had ordered the three men killed in order to consolidate their control over bootlegging operations in North Jersey.

Life and career.
Reilly was born in Manhattan, New York City on June 8, 1938, to a father who was a stockbroker. He attended the Iona Preparatory School in New Rochelle, New York earned an undergraduate degree "cum laude" from the University of Notre Dame and received an MBA from Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration. Reilly served in the United States Army from 1959 to 1961, attaining the rank of lieutenant.
Reilly spent time at W.R. Grace and Company as a financial analyst. He later was named to head the company's home products, sporting goods and textiles divisions.
After joining Macmillan as executive vice president, he was named president of the firm in 1980. His responsibilities included book publishing and the firm's Berlitz and Katherine Gibbs schools.
Reilly left Macmillan in 1990, following the firm's purchase by Robert Maxwell's Maxwell Communications, and was succeeded by David Shaffer as the company's president and chief operating officer. Reilly become president and chief executive of K-III Holdings, in which the private equity firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts held a 75% ownership stake.
The company made a series of acquisitions of niche publications under Reilly's leadership. The firm went public in 1995, selling stock 15 million shares at approximately $12 per share, in a deal that left Kohlberg Kravis Roberts with control of 82.2% of the company's shares. The firm adopted the Primedia name as of November 18, 1997 to more clearly focus on its core business. Primedia sold a group of 17 outdoor-oriented magazines to InterMedia Outdoors for $170 million in cash, in a deal that included "Guns and Ammo" and "Fly Fisherman". Primedia sold its Enthusiast Media division to Source Interlink in a deal that netted Primedia $1.15 billion in cash in exchange for a group of more than 70 magazines, including "Motor Trend" and "Soap Opera Digest" and 90 consumer web sites. The deal left Primedia to focus on a series of free consumer guides published by its Consumer Source unit.
In 1996, Reilly fired Kurt Andersen from his position as editor-in-chief of "New York" magazine citing the publication's financial results. Andersen attributed the firing to his refusal to kill a story about a rivalry between investment bankers Felix Rohatyn and Steven Rattner that had upset Henry Kravis, a member of the firm's ownership group.
He married Ellen Chapman in November 1966, which ended in divorce. Reilly died of bone cancer and prostate cancer at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where he had been receiving hospice care.

Miss Naked Beauty

Miss Naked Beauty is a short-lived, six-episode reality television show produced by Maverick Television, aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom.
The show, presented by Gok Wan and Myleene Klass, was conceived as a radical "reality" take on beauty pageants. Some 7000 women applied to become the "ultimate 21st century beauty queen". The focus of the program is on "natural" and diverse beauty, as opposed to surgically "enhanced" and conformist concepts of beauty.
In the first episode, hundreds of remaining applicants were whittled down to just twelve finalists, by a panel of judges composed of fashion stylist Gok Wan, musician Myleene Klass, magazine editor James Brown, journalist Kathryn Flett and musician, actress and TV presenter Mica Paris. In subsequent episodes, various issues were explored such as body image, plastic surgery, self-esteem, modern versus Renaissance and earlier notions of beauty, eating disorders, over-reliance on makeup, the fashion industry. Meanwhile, the programme also progressed as a pageant, eliminating contestants in typical reality TV style, down to five finalists. Despite its name, the show only features brief nudity (mostly bare breasts), and should not be confused with nude pageants, such as Miss Exotic World.
The show sought a "natural-beauty campaigner" in the winner of the show. The lady crowned Miss Naked Beauty 2008 won the chance to write a magazine column about beauty, become the face of a new modelling agency and be a part of the 2009 series of Gok Wan's other show, "How to Look Good Naked". The competition was won on 25 November 2008 by Shona Collins of London.

Natalia Lipkovskaya (, born 26 April 1979) is a Russian retired rhythmic gymnast. She is the 1997 World All-around silver medalist.
Career.
Lipkovskaya began gymnastics training in 1983. She trained at the Dynamo Krasnoyarsk club, coached by Olga Buyanova. She was second in the national championship in 1993 and 1995.
Lipkovskaya made her first international appearance at the 1995 tournament in Corbeil-Essonnes, ranking 7th and earning a gold medal at the 1995 World championship in Vienna for the team event. She was included on the 1995 Russian World Championship team. Although part of their team gold medal, she played a supporting role to more famous teammates Amina Zaripova and Yanina Batyrchina.
In 1996, Lipkovskaya won an international tournament in Portugal and a bronze in one event at the European championship, but missed the 1996 Summer Olympics in favor of higher-ranking teammates. The Russian national team head coach, Irina Viner, opted to send then-Russian number one and number two Batyrchina and Zaripova to the competition in Atlanta.
In 1997, following the injury of Amina Zaripova, Lipkovskaya led the Russian national team at the 1997 World championship in Berlin, scoring two gold, three silver and one bronze medal, and ranking second after the winner Elena Vitrichenko. Early in 1998, she began her first in a series of treatments for a recurring back injury—an injury many believe was caused by the increasing pressure on gymnasts to display more back flexibility. After several hospital stays and a short-lived return to the gym, she decided to end her career.

Absent Kid

Absent Kid are a British indie rock band.
History.
Brothers Martin and Richard Williams and bassist Mark Butters grew up in the small coastal town of West Mersea. The name Absent Kid was inspired by a character in the cartoon South Park.
They debuted in front of a paying audience, performing at a Colchester venue, "Twist". The band developed as performers during a series of live performances, and gained a degree of prominence after opening for now the disbanded group Ikara Colt. This led to the band's first significant radio play, on XFM London.
In 2004, Absent Kid won the Diesel-U-Music award for Best Rock. An awards ceremony, held at nightclub Fabric was broadcast on Channel 4. Absent Kid were awarded their trophy by BBC Radio 1 DJ Edith Bowman. This brought some attention from the national press, including the influential New Musical Express.
Absent Kid were afterwards signed by Fierce Panda Records, who had previously released records by, amongst others, Coldplay, Idlewild and Keane.
The band's debut mini-album, "I Burnt Down the Family Business", was released with Fierce Panda on 25 April 2005 to critical acclaim. Their double A-side debut single, "Shame On Us All/Quiet Playground", was released on 6 February 2006.
The band gained less notoriety in the following year. They released their first full-length album in July 2007. While their previous works drew comparisons to Radiohead, the new album was hailed as more upbeat and made for the dancefloor.
In December 2009 the band announced a return after a year long hiatus with a new line up with guitarist Kerri-Ann Butcher (formerly from Stand Still Kid) replacing Dominic Harrison.
April 2010 saw Absent Kid record a version of Up the U's for local football club Colchester United which is now played at home games at the club's Weston Homes Community Stadium.

Squandro

Squandro was sachem of the Sokokis tribe in 1675, an American Indian tribe that lived near the Saco River at Saco in Maine. Squandro gained respect among whites because his tribe lived in peace with white settlers for about 50 years. Legend dictates that Squandro returned a white girl who had been captured in a previous raid and reared by his tribe. Dignified and solemn, Squandro was believed to have powers of sorcery and magic. Due to white settlers killing his son and perhaps his wife, Squandro uttered the "Saco Curse" and carried out the first blow in King Philip's War.
Saco curse.
In the summer of 1675, three sailors from an English ship that was anchored at the mouth of the Saco River departed by rowboat, approaching the Indians retreat at Factory Island. When the sailors saw Squandro's pregnant wife and infant son Menewee, they decided to test the European belief that an Indian baby can dog paddle upon birth as do animals. The belief stemmed from the natives' dog paddle style as opposed to the European breaststroke. The three sailors attacked the two Native Americans, throwing Squandro's infant son into the Saco River in front of the child's mother. The infant sank and the mother dove in and retrieved him. However, the infant soon died due to the incident. Another version of the legend states that both the pregnant mother and child died. Chief Squandro mourned for three days, then in a fit of rage he cursed the river, saying that the river would "claim three lives a year
until all white men fled its banks" to replace the lives of the three lost that day. This also ignited violence between the tribe and white settlers and led to the first blow in King Philip's War when Squandro influenced a band of Androscoggins to attack white Saco settlers.
As recently as 1947, residents of the area hesitated to go near the Saco River's waters for fear of the curse of Squandro until after at least three people had drown each summer. During that time, a year passed with no drownings, and the Maine Sunday Telegram proclaimed that the curse was broken with the headline "Saco River Outlives Curse of Indian Chief." However, local belief holds strong to this day. The history of the incident
and its involvement in the
war is rarely disputed, but many view the curse with skepticism. It is conceivable that over the span of the river from its beginning in New Hampshire, at least three lives were lost each year since the curse. Though the story began in the 17th century, there is no existing record of the curse until the late 1880s during the Colonial Revival Movement.

Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges Cathedral

Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges Cathedral (French: "Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges") is a former Roman Catholic cathedral in Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges, Haute-Garonne, southwestern France. It was the seat of the Ancient Diocese of Comminges.
Entering the nave, three distinct architectural styles can be seen at the same time:
The narthex ends in two huge pillars, each with a circumference of no less than 11.45m. Over the northern and southern walls one can see the Romanesque arches, the floor is made of marble and includes some tombs and sepulchurs. The cloister is also clearly Romanesque and offers an impressive view over the entire valley.
The Gothic part is built in the Meridional Gothic style. There is a single nave that is 55m long, 16m wide and 28m high. Over the arrow arches there are the coats of arms of the founding bishops. The stained glass windows are impressive with their intricate details, almost comparable to those of Auch.
The stalls within the choir were commissioned by Jean de Mauléon but because of the lack of documents it is impossible to name the artist that made them, although, by comparison with other stalls, these are often considered to be the work of Nicolas Bachelier, or rather, of his school which had been using artists from France, Spain and Italy. Most of the work was done in oak and walnut tree, and the choir seems to be separate from the rest of the church in that it contrasts so much with the Gothic and Romanesque parts.
The sixty-seven stalls represent characters from both the Old and the New Testaments, including scenes such as 'temptation', 'envy' and 'lust'.
Inside the sanctuary it is possible to see some representations of the "chanson de geste" the "Song of Roland", with Oliver clearly represented.
Bizarrely, there is a stuffed crocodile inside the cathedral.
The former cathedral has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.

Cody Töpper

Cody Arlyn Topper (born January 10, 1983 in Albuquerque, New Mexico as "Cody Arlyn Toppert") is an American-born German professional basketball player. At 6'4" (194 cm) tall, he is a left-handed guard who possesses an ability to shoot the ball and is quick and strong enough to drive past defenders and finish in the lane. He played for the Plymouth Raiders of the BBL for the first half of the 2010-2011 season, before requesting a transfer to the Italian League, which had been a dream of his.
High school career.
Toppert attended the Albuquerque Academy (1998–2001) where he was a two-time USA Today All-American, McDonald's All-American, and was named New Mexico's 2001 Player of the Year, while earning first team all-city, district, and state honors, while twice being named the District Most Valuable Player. During his varsity career, Toppert was invited to play in the Adidas ABCD Camp and was named the top shooting guard at the Five-Star Basketball Camp.
College career.
Toppert went on to star at Cornell University (2001–2005) where he was a four-year starter under coach Steve Donahue. Toppert would become instrumental in helping lay the foundation for a program that had won just five games the year before he arrived to their eventual berth in the 2008 NCAA Tournament. He currently sits 9th all-time at Cornell in career scoring with 1,232 points, while he is 2nd in career three pointers made (237) behind Ryan Wittman, and 2nd in all-time games played (108).

In just his first season, Toppert helped guide the Thunderbirds to their first ever D-League championship. Following his success, Toppert chose to take his talents overseas where he played in New Zealand for the Taranaki Mountain Airs, leading the league in scoring at 22.1 points per game. He then moved on to Europe, playing in Portugal for FC Barreirense, where he averaged 12.2 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game, carrying his club to their first ever appearance in the Cup of Portugal's final four.

Bundesliga, where he averaged 19 points per game, 6.5 rebounds and 2 assists. In summer 2010, he signed for Plymouth Raiders of the British Basketball League.

Cancellation.
On Monday, November 28, 2005, Marc Maron announced that "Morning Sedition" would last air on December 16, at which point Mark Riley would host a new morning show of his own.
"Morning Sedition" was replaced with a four-hour program, "Air America Mornings", with Riley hosting the first two hours (5-7 AM) and Maddow hosting the second two hours (7-9 AM), in an effort to bolster Air America's ratings for its morning programming. Maron had a new show, "The Marc Maron Show", that debuted February 28, 2006. The show was broadcast from Burbank, California, on KTLK, Progressive Talk 1150 AM. Its time slot was 10:00 - 12:00 PM, Pacific Standard Time, and the show included several sketches that had previously appeared on "Morning Sedition".
There was a great outpouring from "Morning Sedition" fans, including thousands of e-mails to Goldberg, other AAR hosts, and AAR board members. Additionally, over 6,300 fans signed an online petition calling for the renewal of Maron's contract and the "Morning Sedition" program.

Friends School of Atlanta

The Friends School of Atlanta is an independent school in Decatur, Georgia.
History.
The Atlanta Friends Meeting was organized in 1943, and in the late 1950s the Meeting purchased a residence on Fairview Road in the historic Druid Hills neighborhood. In addition to providing a gathering place for Friends, the Meetinghouse was one of the few sites in the city available for interracial meetings and education. In 1990, the Meeting built a new facility near the border of Atlanta and the City of Decatur.
The Friends School of Atlanta, which was incorporated as a nonprofit institution in 1990, grew out of the work of a committee of the Meeting. In 1991, The Friends School of Atlanta's Board of Trustees called Waman French, an educator with experience at Brooklyn Friends School and Atlanta International School, to be the first Head of School. Meeting members are active in the school’s Board of Trustees and offer guidance and support to the school in many ways.
Leasing space in the newly constructed Friends Meetinghouse at West Howard and Adair Streets in Decatur, the school opened in the fall of 1991 with 37 students, ages 4½ through eight, and three teachers. A key to the early success of the school has been—and continues to be—the strong involvement of parents, whose efforts have included providing administrative and secretarial assistance in the office, coordinating a hot lunch program, building the playground, serving on committees, and taking part in policy development.
The school stayed at the Meetinghouse for five years, expanding by a grade a year and adding portable classrooms on the property. In 1995, two classes relocated to the First Christian Church in downtown Decatur and in 1996, the entire school moved there while awaiting the renovation of its permanent space.
In 1997, we moved to 121 Sams Street in Decatur, at first using one half of the building, sharing space with S & A Industries until 2001, when we renovated the other half of the building, including a Meeting room for whole school and community events.
After a tenure of eight years as Head of School, Waman French decided to return to working with children in the middle school in 1999. The Board of Trustees appointed Marcia Pauly as its next Head of School. With a rich educational background, most recently with Decatur City Schools, she led FSA into the twenty-first century. Reluctantly, Marcia stepped down as Head in June, 2001 for personal reasons.
In July 2001, James D. Withers became the next Head of The Friends School of Atlanta. Jim Withers is a long-time Atlanta educator, President of Withers Consulting Services and former Academic Dean at Pace Academy. Upon taking the helm at FSA, Jim left his consulting business where he worked with public and private organizations in mediation, conflict resolution and team-building. Jim stepped aside as Head in May 2003, and Waman French returned as Interim Head for the 2003–04 school year. Waman was subsequently chosen by the Head Search committee to continue as Head of School. Under his leadership, the Board of Trustees began a search for a possible new location to relocate and grow the school.
In 2007, The Friends School of Atlanta began a capital campaign to purchase and renovate a new school site at 862 Columbia Drive. The school moved to its new home in the 2008–09 school year. The new location is much bigger, and is enhanced by two playgrounds and an enclosed gymnasium.
Campus.
The Friends School of Atlanta occupies what was formerly the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. On the first floor are the administrative offices, the art classroom, and the middle school lunchroom. On the second floor are the elementary school classrooms, the elementary Spanish classroom, the music room, and the Community Meeting Room. On the third floor are the middle school classrooms, the media lab, the middle school Spanish classroom, and the library. Behind the school is a playground and a gym.

The Salmon Fly

The Salmon Fly - "How to Dress It and How to Use It" is a fly fishing book written by George M. Kelson published in London in 1895 by Messers. Wyman & Sons, Limited.
Synopsis.
In "The Salmon Fly", George Kelson boldly and confidently distilled a lifetime of salmon fishing wisdom into this privately published work. The book contains 510 pages of text and 46 pages of illustrations plus 8 coloured plates showing 52 flies. Many of the black & white illustrations are of fly-fishing contemporaries of Kelson—to include Mr. A.V. Wells-Ridley J.P; Major J.P. Traherne; Mr. Barclay Field. The first part of the book is devoted to the techniques of tying the salmon fly as well as patterns for individual flies. Here's a typical pattern write-up:
It is only just possible to find a river or a catch, be it in pools,
streams, rapids, or flats, shaded or exposed to the light of day, in which a
"Jock Scott," when dressed properly, has not made for itself a splendid
reputation.
The second part of the book is devoted to the practical aspects of fishing for salmon with the fly—locating fish, casting techniques, catching and landing fish and various accessories and equipment. "The Salmon Fly" also includes 46 full page black and white advertisements for mostly angling and sporting pursuits.
Reviews.
"The Salmon Fly" by G. M. Kelson was published in 1895; the sub-title is: "How to dress and how to use it." It is a handsome quarto of more than 500 pages and beautifully illustrated. Kelson is regarded as the first writer to whom the amateur could go for proper guidance in salmon fly-dressing 
"The Salmon Fly" enjoys a unique position in the literature of fly dressing since it brought order and system to the classification of salmon flies and the methodology of salmon fly dressing.
Fly tiers in the Old World responded to an increased availability of exotic feathers and furs with ever more elaborate patterns, the trend reaching is finest statement in George Kelson's "The Salmon Fly" (1895) and T. E. Pryce Tannant's "How to Dress Salmon Flies" (1914). Kelson's book, with its excellent color plates and dressings for some three hundred patterns, became the salmon fly's equivalent to Mary Orvis Marbury's "Favorite Flies"; what the latter book did for the nineteenth-century American wet fly, Kelson's did for the late-Victorian salmon fly.
Kelson's book is considered one of the greatest works on the subject of salmon fishing. The book was not without its controversy as it rekindled some of the rivalry between R. B. Marston, editor of the "Fishing Gazette" and Kelson. Marston insisted that many of the patterns claimed by Kelson in the book were actually the works of other salmon fishers, not Kelson. Marston also claimed that many patterns attributed to one tier were actually the design of another tier. In the end much of Kelson's reputation was tarnished but the book is still one of the great classics of the era.

Roosevelt Hall (Minnesota)

Roosevelt Hall is a community auditorium and gymnasium building in Barrett, Minnesota, in Grant County. The building was built by the Civil Works Administration, a predecessor of the Works Progress Administration, in 1934. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 for being one of the few buildings built by the CWA in Minnesota. The CWA made it possible for small communities such as Barrett to build architecturally sophisticated buildings at a low cost. The building has also served as a social, cultural, and educational center for the community.
The building is built of wood frame construction and measures wide by long. It is faced with western red cedar clapboard siding, and topped with a gabled roof with wood shingles. The interior originally had a wooden gymnasium floor, a by stage, and a by balcony.
The gymnasium was once used by the local public school, but after they built their own gymnasium in the early 1950s, the hall's use began to decline. The original stage was removed in 1957, and the building housed a bowling alley for 14 years. It then housed a youth center in 1973-1974, and it was used as an insulation manufacturing plant from 1977 through 1979. The building is now used by the Prairie Wind Players, a community theater group. The theater group built a proscenium stage in the early 1980s. In 2004, the lobby was gutted and remodeled, with new restrooms and new ticket booths.

Government Science College, Matale

Government Science College, Matale ( GSC ) ( Sinhala : රජයේ විද්‍යා විද්‍යාලය ) is a co-educational government secondary school located in Matale, Sri Lanka. Although only established in 1954, it has developed a reputation for high academic standards, and has many notable alumni.
Mission.
The school's mission is to provide educational opportunities for students from Mother Science College seeking help, in order to develop knowledge skills enabling them to lead productive lives. 
History.
This school was inaugurated on 15 February 1954. The original staff consisted of Mrs. Wimala Silva and Mr. S. Manual Pillai, while Mr. S. Rathnasabapathy was the principal.
The first half decade of Science College, truly reflects the personality and dedication of Mr. Rathnasabapathy. His philosophy was to advance the educational and environmental conditions of the college.
Although there were large schools in the Matale district when Science College was founded, there was an absence of a facility dedicated to promoting higher education in science. Mr. V.T. Nanayakkara, the Member of Parliament for the Matale electorate, recognized this deficiency, and set out to correct it. The result was GSC. The school was not limited to students of Matale district, but also accepted students from other districts such as Kandy, Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Pollonnaruwa, Kegalle, Badulla, as well as the the most remote district on the island, Jaffna. The students who studied here included Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher.
In 1954, the school consisted of only 40 students and two staff members, however, by year's end the student population had risen to 90 students and the staff had increased to 4.
In the 1970s, the student population increased to 250, and today stands in excess of 500. During those first decades, the focus of the school was to promote as many students as possible to the university level. The success of this focus can be seen in the examination scores of the students, as well as the number of medical and engineer students accepted by universities. 
In the 1960s, due to government policy of teaching science in both Sinhala and Tamil, Rathnasabapathy was required to transfer to Jaffna. This became a turning point for the school. The principal who succeeded Rathnasabapathy was Mr. H.R.P Rupasinghe, who brought with him an interest in sports, introducing cricket to the school. Since its introduction to the school, the students have proven successful in sports as well as academics, playing at a high level in cricket, Field hockey and netball.
Mr. Rupasinghe was followed by several other principals in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s, the department of education made the decision to end O/L classes, accommodating only advanced level classes. This resulted in an increase in the number of students able to participate in higher education.
Currently, the college has a very strong and supportive "Past Pupils Association" (alumni), with branches in Colombo, Anuradapura, as well as in Australia. They assist the college in both its academic and sports endeavors. 
Alumni.
A list of prominent past pupils of Science College: 
Student Activities.
Students are divided into three houses, named "Einstein", "Lavoisier" and "Darwin". In 2011, the school initiated a college band, called "Eastern Band". The school has 3 clubs, the Science Society, the Buddhist Society and the Interact Club.
Sports.
GSC fields teams in three sports: cricket, netball, and chess.
School song.
Composed by Mr. Thillekeratne, a teacher at GSC during the late 1970s, after an unsuccessful attempt to get a renowned song writer in Sri Lanka to write it. 
The song, in Sinhalese:
විදු විදුහල් මාතා සැරදේ
පතුරා විදු නැණ ලෝ පතලේ
සොහොයුරු ප්‍රේමෙන් එක් සිත් බැඳුනේසිසු කැල සැම සිප් සයුරෙහි ගිල්වා වීර පුතුන් ඔබ ජනිත කරන්නා විදු විදුහල් මාතා සැරදේ ...//

Leigh Halfpenny

Stephen Leigh Halfpenny (born 22 December 1988) is a Welsh international rugby union player who plays for the Cardiff Blues regional side.
Early life.
Halfpenny is from Gorseinon, near Swansea. He attended Pontybrenin Primary School and Penyrheol Comprehensive School.
Early career.
A winger or fullback, he was signed as a youth by the Neath Swansea Ospreys and played the 2005–06 season with the Ospreys U18s. Halfpenny then trained with Neath RFC during the 2006–07 season, before signing for the Cardiff Blues and making his debut against Ulster at the Ravenhill Stadium in May 2008, scoring three conversions in the 17–26 victory.
International career.
2008–09.
As a former Wales Under 20 international, he was selected in October 2008 for the Wales national rugby union team squad for the 2008 Autumn internationals series.
Halfpenny made his debut for Wales aged 19 in their first game of the autumn internationals against world champions, South Africa on 8 November 2008. He scored his first points for Wales from a penalty kick in the 15–20 loss. He went on to score his first two tries on his second cap against Canada on 14 November.
He was chosen as a starting number 14 for Wales's 2009 Six Nations game against Scotland, on 8 February, and again on 14 February, against rivals England. He scored a try in each match and kicked a penalty against England to add to that. His points proved to be the difference between the two teams. He then played against France in a match that Wales lost 21–16 in Saint-Denis. Warren Gatland then dropped Halfpenny for the 20–15 win over Italy, as Warren Gatland experimented with winger Mark Jones.
On 22 April 2009, Halfpenny was included in the British & Irish Lions squad for the tour to South Africa in May 2009.
On the 20 May it was announced that he would miss the start of the Lions tour due to a thigh injury, requiring at least 10–14 days treatment, but he was scheduled once fully fit to rejoin Ian McGeechan's squad in South Africa. He was confirmed to have linked up with the Lions squad, fully recovered, in South Africa on 2 June and played in the tour match against Free State Cheetahs on 6 June. However, on 10 June it was confirmed that Halfpenny had withdrawn from the Lions squad due to a recurrence of the thigh injury.
2010–11.
Halfpenny was a key part of the Wales squad for the following two campaigns but he was constantly plagued by injury. Coach Warren Gatland had faith in Halfpenny, and the Blues winger did enough to force his way into the squad for the 2011 World Cup. During the World Cup, Halfpenny impressed in many positions, particularly at full-back. It was also in this game that Halfpenny became first choice kicker, ahead of fly halves Rhys Priestland and James Hook. In the semi final against France, Halfpenny attempted a 47 yard penalty that would have taken Wales to the final. However, the kick fell inches short.
2012–13.
During the 2012 Six Nations, Halfpenny cemented his place at fullback and became one of the standout players of the tournament, finishing as top point scorer of the tournament. Some of his points came at crucial points within the tournament. Down 21-20 to Ireland in the 80th minutes, Halfpenny sent a penalty over to give Wales a 23-21 win over the hosts, and subsequently completed another 4 penalties and a conversion as Wales toppled England. Then, in the final match against France, Wales got a 16-9 win, with Halfpenny converting three further penalties and a conversion.
In the final match of the 2012 Winter Test series against Australia, Halfpenny suffered a neck injury while attempting to stop the winning try. He was taken to hospital but was discharged the next day without any serious damage. Regardless of the Australian try, Halfpenny had already earned the accolade of "Man of the Match".
In the first match of the 2013 Six Nations Championship, Halfpenny scored the 2nd try for Wales in their 2230 loss to Ireland at the Millennium Stadium. The following week he earned the "Man of the Match" award when Wales beat France 616 in Paris. Again two weeks later in Rome when Wales beat Italy 926, he was made "Man of the Match" by the Italian broadcaster. With over 80,000 people voting between 15 shortlisted 2013 Six Nations players, Halfpenny was also awarded "Player of the Tournament", securing 40% of the overall vote.
Halfpenny was selected for the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia as one of three fullbacks touring along with Stuart Hogg and Rob Kearney. Halfpenny played all three tests, winning player of the series, and breaking the Lions points record held by Neil Jenkins. He also broke the record for most points in one test 
In November 2013 Halfpenny was named in a shortlist of five players for the IRB Player of the Year. In December 2013 Halfpenny was selected as BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year and was runner-up for BBC Sports Personality of the Year to Andy Murray.
Cardiff Blues.
On 18 April 2009, Halfpenny scored two tries for the Cardiff Blues in the final of the EDF Energy Cup, a 50–12 win over Gloucester at Twickenham. In January 2014 Halfpenny announced that he would be leaving the Blues at the end of the 2013–14 Season after signing a two year deal with French giants Toulon.

Hadley Cantril

Hadley Cantril (1906–1969) was an American researcher of public opinion.
Biography.
Born in Utah, he was educated at Dartmouth College and received his Ph.D. from Harvard. He joined the faculty of Princeton in 1936 and later became chairman of the Princeton University Department of Psychology. He was a member of the Princeton Radio Research Project before it relocated to Columbia University during the early 1940s, and was the main author of "The Invasion from Mars", an academic study of Orson Welles's 1938 radio broadcast of "The War of the Worlds", which caused widespread panic. In 1940 he served as a consultant to the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. Cantril's later psychological work included collaboration with Adelbert Ames, Jr. developing a transactional method for studying human perception, as well as other research in humanistic psychology.
Public opinion research.
Though trained as a psychologist, Cantril's most important work concerned the then-new topic of public opinion research. Influenced initially by the success of George Gallup and Elmo Roper during the 1936 presidential election, Cantril sought to apply their systematic polling technique to academic social psychology. Cantril was a founding editor of "Public Opinion Quarterly". In 1940 he founded Princeton University's Office of Public Opinion Research. and from autumn 1940 onwards provided the Roosevelt administration with confidential information about American public opinion, particularly regarding the war in Europe. In 1942 Cantril conducted a small-sample survey of Vichy officials in Morocco, prior to Operation Torch, that revealed the intensity of the anti-British sentiment of the French forces there. This information influenced the disposition of forces during the operation, with American troops landing near Casablanca and mixed forces at Oran and Algiers.
In 1955 he founded the Institute for International Social Research (IISR) with Lloyd A. Free. Cantril had previously provided data on public opinion in America and abroad to Presidents Roosevelt and Eisenhower, and the IISR was often asked by United States government agencies to conduct small-sample public opinion polls in foreign countries. Notably, Cantril and Free conducted a poll of Cuba during 1960 demonstrating great support for Fidel Castro, which was overlooked during the presidential transition between Eisenhower and Kennedy and read only after the Bay of Pigs Invasion fiasco. Cantril's most-cited work is "The Pattern of Human Concerns," notable for the development of the self-anchoring scale (also known as "Cantril's Ladder"). Cantril and Free also first discovered the paradox that American voters tend to oppose "big government" in general while supporting many specific liberal social programs.
During the late 1950s, Cantril served on the International Objectives and Strategies panel of the Rockefeller Brothers' Special Studies Project.

Ann Gale

Gale works from live models and her process is lengthy. Once she begins to paint, she works for three-hour sessions, and takes from four months to two years to complete a painting. Her pieces possess a strong psychological component due to the amount of time she spends with her models.
Gale received her BFA from the Rhode Island College in 1988 and her MFA from Yale University in 1991. She has been the recipient of several awards including: Western States Art Federation/National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship (1996), Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation Grant (1997), Trust Grant/GAP Award (2003) and a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship (2007). The artist's work has been shown in galleries and museums across the United States including solo exhibitions at the Portland Art Museum, Portland, Oregon (2007) and the Weatherspoon Art Museum at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (2008).

A former Wales Under-20 international, in October 2008 he was selected for the Wales national rugby union team squad for the 2008 Autumn internationals series, making his debut against Canada on 18 November. He is the youngest player to reach 100 games for the Ospreys.
On 18 January 2010 he was named in the 35 man Wales national squad for the 2010 Six Nations tournament.
After 18 months in the wilderness, including missing the 2011 Rugby World Cup, good form for the Ospreys saw Biggar recalled for the Welsh squad in 2012. This good form was topped off by the match-winning conversion from the touchline in the 2012 RaboDirect Pro12 Final, as well as a number of man-of-the-match performances in the run-in at the end of the season. Biggar finally got his chance in the Welsh number 10 shirt in the victorious 2013 RBS Six Nations Championship campaign, starting all five games at Fly Half, thanks to a Rhys Priestland injury. Biggar impressed many, capping off the season with a drop goal, conversion and penalty in the Championship decider against England.

Hombres (song)

"Hombres" (, "") is a song that was Spain's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1993, held in Millstreet, Republic of Ireland. It was sung by Eva Santamaría, who was chosen by the Spanish broadcaster, Televisión Española (TVE), as their representative in the Contest that year.
Internal selection.
From 1977 to 1999, TVE used an internal selection process to select both the singer and the song to represent them at Eurovision. For 1993, Eva Santamaría, a 22-year-old singer who had just finished recording her first album in Los Angeles, California, U.S.A., was selected to go to Millstreet with the lead song from her album, "Hombres," written and composed by the journalist Carlos Toro.
At Eurovision.
At Millstreet, the song was performed twenty-second on the night, following Croatia's Put with "Don't Ever Cry" and preceding Cyprus's Kyriakos Zymboulakis and Dimos van Beke with "Mi Stamatas". At the end of judging that evening, "Hombres" took the eleventh-place slot with 58 points. No countries awarded Spain 12 points, the maximum score allotted to one country by another. Finland, however, deemed "Hombres" their second-favorite song of the evening and awarded Spain 10 points, Spain's highest allotment received from one country.
The song is sung from the point of view of a woman fed up with dating and men in general. Santamaría describes men as "selfish," "conceited," "vain," accusing them of confusing "machismo and masculinity," and lamenting that when they say "love," they mean "sex." However, she sings that when men are not around, "women feel lonely," and that men truly do make women happy, as they are as complementary as "war and peace...sun and moon...land and sea."

Edward Jackson (photographer)

Edward Norman Jackson (June 28, 1885 – November 11, 1967) was an American photographer and photojournalist for the "New York Daily News." Jackson was President Woodrow Wilson’s European photographer during the close of World War I and photographed "The Big Four" world leaders at the Paris Peace Conference.
Early life.
The youngest of four siblings of an Irish immigrant family, Jackson was born in Philadelphia on June 28, 1885. His impoverished family would often go to the local soup house to obtain a ticket for a loaf of bread and another ticket for a can of bean soup, his personal journal states. Jackson sold newspapers ("Philadelphia Bulletin") on street corners to help his family, where he met a studio photographer who offered him a job after school and Saturdays. He was paid $1.50 a week. The studio specialized in tintype portraitures in 1901. In 1903 the studio moved to Atlantic City and Jackson went with them. Jackson moved to New York City and worked for the American Press Association in the photo engraving department in 1912 where he also became a freelance news photographer.
News photography.
Jackson's career as a news photographer began on the streets of New York City where he would provide photographs to many news agencies and magazines throughout the country. Working as a paparazzo, Jackson would stalk his newsworthy subjects throughout the city. The burgeoning use of photography for newspaper stories launched him into this vocation. From his personal journal:
"A new field of photography was emerging in 1910; newspapers wanted photographs to replace sketches and drawings for the news events they were going to print. The era of news photography was just beginning and I wanted to become one in the worst way. I never doubted my decision."
In 1913 Jackson accepted his first foreign freelance assignment and steamed to Panama aboard the "Prince August William" to photograph the Panama Canal before its official opening in 1914. In 1915 Jackson was invited by his friend Thomas Alva Edison, newly appointed as President of the Naval Reserve Board, to document the inspection of a highly secret United States submarine "E-2" in the Brooklyn Navy yard. The United States had not entered World War I and did not want the warring nations to know about the development of submarine capability. Two weeks later the submarine mysteriously exploded, killing several personnel. Jackson’s forbidden photograph of the damaged submarine appeared in all of the New York papers.
World War I.
Many years past the draft age, Jackson joined the Army Signal Corps (reserves) at the age of 32 and reported for training at Camp Alfred Vail in Little Silver, New Jersey on October 22, 1917. Due to his extensive photographic experience he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant and was assigned the title of Official War Photographer. Several months later he was selected to be President Woodrow Wilson’s official photographer.
Jackson spent nearly a year on the battlefront in France and received several military commendations. He was given a battlefield promotion to Captain of the twenty-seventh division of the Army Signal Corps, and assigned directly to President Wilson’s European peace entourage. His photograph of “The Big Four” taken in Paris on May 27, 1919 showed the leaders of the free world: British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Italian Premier Vittorio Orlando, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, and US President Woodrow Wilson.
Post-war years.
Returning from France a seasoned, recognized professional news photographer, Jackson was offered many employment offers. He decided to work with Joseph Mendill Patterson and his cousin Robert R. McCormick, who were co-publishers of the "Chicago Tribune" and wanted to start a New York tabloid newspaper, "The New York Daily News." Launched on June 26, 1919 with Edward N. Jackson as their lead photographer, the publishers wanted large and prominent photographs of city news, entertainment and sports events and local city coverage, all of which was assigned to Jackson. "The New York Daily News" is today the sixth largest newspaper in the country and has won ten Pulitzer prizes.
In 1927 William Randolph Hearst wanted to promote his newspaper the "New York Daily Mirror" by sponsoring a non-stop historic flight from New York to Rome following Charles Lindbergh’s successful flight from New York to Paris (May 20–21, 1927). The aircraft—"Old Glory"—a German Fokker F.VII, was to be manned by pilots Lloyd W. Bertaud and James DeWitt Hill and the "Daily Mirror" managing editor Phillip A. Payne, a close friend of Jackson’s, flying with them for one-on-one news coverage. The historic flight left Old Orchard Beach, Maine on the morning of September 6, 1927. Sixteen hours into the flight a SOS was received and the aircraft was never heard from again. Jackson reportedly took the last known photograph of "Old Glory" on August 26, 1927 for his friend. It was never published.
Another historic flight that Jackson covered was the flight of the "Bremen," a German Junkers W-33 aircraft crewed by Baron Gunther von Hünefeld, Hermann Köhl and James C. Fitzmaurice in April, 1928. The planned east to west Atlantic Ocean crossing took flight on Thursday, April 12, 1928 from Baldonnel, Ireland, with a destination at Mitchel Field, New York, where Jackson waited for their arrival. Thirty-six hours after "Bremen" left Ireland, it was forced to crash-land on Greenly Island in Canada. Jackson immediately left for Canada and hired a single-engine aircraft to fly him and other news reporters to Greenly Island to cover the story. While none of the flight crew were injured as a result of the accident, famed aviator Floyd Bennett became ill and died while attempting to salvage the "Bremen" from Greenly Island.
The Great Depression.
Edward Jackson personally covered “Black Thursday,” October 24, 1929 when Wall Street experienced the beginnings of the famed stock market crash leading to the infamous “Black Tuesday” on October 29, 1929 – the beginnings of the Great Depression. Jackson’s camera captured much of this tragedy over the next ten years. The worst and longest economic collapse in history, the depression spread to most of the world’s industrialized countries like a firestorm. Businesses and banks closed their doors. Millions of jobs were lost, leaving many without homes, savings or even food. Jackson documented on film, this national tragedy.
Later life.
Edward Jackson remained with The "New York Daily News" until his retirement in 1958 at 73. His only child, Edith May Jackson, gave Eddie three grandchildren; Noreen, John and Barry Fitzgerald who often visited him at his home in Wilton, Connecticut. Jackson died from natural causes at 82.

William Allen Johnson

William Allen Johnson (October 27, 1816 - January 20, 1901) of Westfield, Massachusetts, USA, was a builder of pipe organs during the later half of the nineteenth century. (See Johnson Organs). Previously, Johnson had operated a successful construction company in Westfield, where some of his buildings may still be seen.
Early life.
William was born in Nassau, New York on October 27, 1816, to William R. and Eliza Allen Johnson, the first of eight children. In 1819, the Johnson family moved to Hawley, Franklin County, Massachusetts, then shortly afterward to Westfield, Massachusetts, following William's father's trade as a millwright
Young Johnson first attended a private school, then the public school. His formal education ended at the age of thirteen when he began to earn his own living. After working on a farm for two years, he worked in a glue factory, then at a whip factory in Westfield which is still known as "Whip City". In September 1834 Johnson apprenticed himself to a mason for a term of three years and three months. During this period, he worked in a cotton mill in Chicopee, Massachusetts during wintertimes. At the end of his apprenticeship, Johnson formed his own construction business, doing considerable work in the Westfield area.
In November 1839, William A Johnson married Mary Ann Douglas. Mary Johnson went on to become well known as a talented artist. Some of her paintings of the Westfield River Valley and the surrounding hills can be seen at the Westfield Athenaeum.
The William A. Johnson / Johnson and Son Organ Co..
In 1843, Johnson's construction firm was chosen to build a new building for his own church, the Westfield Methodist Church. As the building was being completed, an organ builder arrived to install a pipe organ. When asked about the availability of a worker to help set up the organ, Mr. Johnson readily applied for the job. During the installation of this organ, William became interested in the art of organ building.
During a slack period of construction work in the winter of 1843 - 1844, Mr. Johnson decided to build a small parlor organ. It was of just one rank or set of pipes, had one keyboard, and no pedalboard. By successfully completing this project, he proved to himself that he had the skills necessary for the building of pipe organs. Continuing this practice, Johnson built six parlor organs of increased size during the next three winters. In 1847, he decided to accept only construction contracts that could be finished by the fall so that he could close his construction business and devote all of his time to the building of pipe organs.
Johnson soon assembled a team of skilled craftsmen to augment his own considerable skills. The Johnson Organ Company became one of the most respected organ firms of the country. In 1871, following a disastrous fire and the inclusion of Johnson's son William H. Johnson into the firm, the company became known as "Johnson and Son". The firm built a total of 860 tracker action pipe organs throughout the United States and in Canada and Bermuda before it ceased operations in 1898
William A. Johnson died on January 20, 1901, at the age of 84.

Dorothy Miner

Dorothy Marie Miner (August 14, 1936 – October 21, 2008) was an attorney who helped develop legal protections for historic landmarks in New York City and across the United States.
Miner was born on August 14, 1936, in the Manhattan section of New York. Her father was a professor of history at Columbia University. Miner earned a bachelor's degree from Smith College in 1958, a law degree from Columbia Law School in 1961 and a degree in urban planning from Columbia University in 1972. She married James Edward O'Driscoll, a lecturer in the American language program at Columbia on June 25, 1970; The marriage lasted until his death in 1993.
In 1973, Miner was named as counsel to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Her work helped create the legal process for the 1983 landmark status designation of the 17th-century street plan of Lower Manhattan as part of a historic district. This plan helped prevent developers from restructuring the irregular blocks in the area's grid structure.
Miner played a major role in presenting the city's case in "Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City" (1978), in which the Supreme Court of the United States upheld (by a 6-3 margin) the ability of New York City to restrict development of Grand Central Terminal based on the building's landmark designation. The Penn Central company had argued that the development restrictions placed on the site constituted an unconstitutional taking of its property by the government in conflict with the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
In 1994, new Landmarks Preservation Commission chair Jennifer Raab announced that Miner would be leaving as chief counsel at the end of October 1998, citing the need for a "fresh eye". Raab acknowledged Miner's "very large and important role" and affirmed that it was Miner "who helped establish the legal right to designate landmarks."
After leaving the Landmarks Preservation Commission, Miner accepted a position at Pace University School of Law and as an adjunct associate professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation.
She lived in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, and died at age 72 of complications of lung disease.

Ivo Pukanić (21 January 1961 – 23 October 2008) was a Croatian journalist. He was best known as editor-in-chief of the once influential Croatian political weekly "Nacional".
Life and career.
Pukanić was born in Zagreb. He graduated from the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Zagreb in 1983, after which he started working for Vjesnik publishing house as a photographer for two of their weekly magazines, "Start" and "Studio".
In 1992 he started his career as a journalist and editor at the popular weekly "Globus" published by Europapress Holding. He left "Globus" only three years later in 1995 to start his own weekly publication, "Nacional", where he held the post of editor-in-chief until 2000. That same year Pukanić received an award from Croatian Journalists' Association. He also later received an award for a 2003 interview with army general Ante Gotovina, who was at the time on the run due to accusations of war crimes by the ICTY.
Assassination.
Pukanić was assassinated on October 23, 2008, at 6.10 p.m. local time by a bomb planted on a motorcycle parked next to his Lexus LS600hL in the center of Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. He was killed alongside Niko Franjić, the "Nacional" marketing manager. The incident happened in Stara Vlaška Street, only two street blocks east of Ban Jelačić Square, the central square of Zagreb. It was caught on CCTV, with the footage showing the explosion moments before Pukanić and Franjić were about to enter the vehicle.
"Nacional" reporter Plamenko Cvitić was the first news reporter on the scene. The police immediately blocked the traffic around the site of assassination, causing immense traffic jams all over the city center. Prime Minister Ivo Sanader declined a proposal for entering a state of emergency.
Eight people, suspected of having connections to organised crime groups, were indicted. Six were later convicted over Pukanić's murder with prison terms ranging from 15 to 40 years.
Pukanić was survived by his wife, Mirjana, and daughter, Sara (born c. 1991).

Michael Gorlovsky

Michael Gorlovsky (, born 24 January 1963) is a former Israeli politician who served as a member of the Knesset for Likud between 2003 and 2006. During his term he was involved in what became known as the "double votes scam".
Biography.
Born in Dzerzhinsk in the Soviet Union, Gorlovsky made aliyah to Israel in 1988.
In 1996 he was photographed removing Labor Party posters during the election campaign. He worked as a chauffeur and operations man for Avigdor Lieberman.
For the 2003 elections he was placed 27th on the Likud list, and entered the Knesset when the party won 38 seats. Whilst an MK, he served on several Knesset committees, including the House Committee, the Finance Committee, the Internal Affairs and Environment Committee, the Committee on Foreign Workers and the Committee for Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs.
In 2003 he voted twice during a Knesset ballot (placing a vote on behalf of Gilad Erdan), a move he blamed on being "tired" and "confused". Attorney General Menachem Mazuz requested that the Knesset lift his parliamentary immunity, but the request was rejected by the House Committee. The Movement for Quality Government filed a petition with the High Court to protest the committee's decision, resulting in a decision that the committee had overstepped its authority in not revoking Gorlovsky's immunity. However, the committee ignored the verdict, resulting in a second petition from the movement. In November 2005 Mazuz announced that he would be charging Gorlovksy with fraud, deception and breach of trust.
He lost his seat in the March 2006 elections, and in September 2006 the Jerusalem prosecutor's office informed the court that it had struck a plea bargain with Gorlovsky in which he would be charged with breach of trust rather than fraud. In February 2007 he received a suspended sentence and community service.

French frigate Clorinde (1808)

The Clorinde was a 40-gun "Pallas"-class frigate of the French Navy, designed by Sané.
From June 1809, she was stationed with the 16-gun "Milan" and the 38-gun "Renommée". In September, she sailed with "Renommée", "Loire" and "Seine" to Guadeloupe. On 13 December, she and "Renommée" captured HMS "Junon".
On 15 December 1809, she ran aground, and freed herself by dropping guns and ammunition overboard.
She took part in the Action of 20 May 1811, fought off Madagascar, and returned to Brest. Captain Jacques Saint-Cricq was found guilty of failing to properly support his commodore, and demoted of rank, expelled from the legion of Honour, and sentenced to three years in prison.
On 25 February 1814, at lat. 47° 40' N., lon. 9° 30' W., under Commander René Joseph Marie Denis-Lagarde, she was chased by the 38-gun HMS "Eurotas". A violent fight ensued for two hours and 20 minutes that left both ships dismasted, "Eurotas" suffering 20 killed and 30 wounded (including Captain John Phillimore), and "Clorinde", 40 killed and 80 wounded. During the night, the ships built jury rigs and resumed the pursuit the next day, when HMS "Dryad" and HMS "Achates" intervened. The helpless "Clorinde" struck after the first cannon shot from "Dryad", who towed her to Portsmouth. 
"Clorinde" was brought into British service as HMS "Aurora". She served off South America from 1821-25 and in the Caribbean from 1826-28.
From 1832, she was used as a coal depot in Falmouth, and was eventually broken up in 1851.

Diffusion

Diffusion is one of several transport phenomena that occur in nature. A distinguishing feature of diffusion is that it results in mixing or mass transport, without requiring bulk motion. Thus, diffusion should not be confused with convection, or advection, which are other transport mechanisms that utilize bulk motion to move particles from one place to another. In Latin, "diffundere" means "to spread out".
There are two ways to introduce the notion of "diffusion": either a phenomenological approach starting with Fick's laws of diffusion and their mathematical consequences, or a physical and atomistic one, by considering the "random walk of the diffusing particles".
In the phenomenological approach, according to Fick's laws, the diffusion flux is proportional to the negative gradient of concentrations. It goes from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration. Some time later, various generalizations of Fick's laws were developed in the frame of thermodynamics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.
From the "atomistic point of view", diffusion is considered as a result of the random walk of the diffusing particles. In molecular diffusion, the moving molecules are self-propelled by thermal energy. Random walk of small particles in suspension in a fluid was discovered in 1827 by Robert Brown. The theory of the Brownian motion and the atomistic backgrounds of diffusion were developed by Albert Einstein.
The concept of diffusion is widely used in: physics (particle diffusion), chemistry, biology, sociology, economics, and finance (diffusion of people, ideas and of price values). The concept of diffusion is typically applied to any subject matter involving random walks in ensembles of individuals.
History of diffusion in physics.
In the scope of time, diffusion in solids was used long before the theory of diffusion was created. For example, Pliny the Elder had previously described the cementation process which produces steel from the element iron (Fe) through carbon diffusion. Another example is well known for many centuries, the diffusion of colours of stained glass or earthenware and Chinese ceramics.
In modern science, the first systematic experimental study of diffusion was performed by Thomas Graham. He studied diffusion in gases, and the main phenomenon was described by him in 1831–1833:
"...gases of different nature, when brought into contact, do not arrange themselves according to their density, the heaviest undermost, and the lighter uppermost, but they spontaneously diffuse, mutually and equally, through each other, and so remain in the intimate state of mixture for any length of time.” 
The measurements of Graham contributed to James Clerk Maxwell deriving, in 1867, the coefficient of diffusion for CO2 in air. The error rate is less than 5%.
In 1855, Adolf Fick, the 26-year old anatomy demonstrator from Zürich, proposed his law of diffusion. He used Graham's research, stating his goal as "the development of a fundamental law, for the operation of diffusion in a single element of space". He asserted a deep analogy between diffusion and conduction of heat or electricity, creating a formalism that is similar to Fourier's law for heat conduction (1822) and Ohm's law for electrical current (1827).
Robert Boyle demonstrated diffusion in solids in the 17th century by penetration of Zinc into a copper coin. Nevertheless, diffusion in solids was not systematically studied till the second part of the 19th century. William Chandler Roberts-Austen, the well-known British metallurgist, and former assistant of Thomas Graham, studied systematically solid state diffusion on the example of gold in lead in 1896. :
"... My long connection with Graham's researches made it almost a duty to attempt to extend his work on liquid diffusion to metals."
In 1858, Rudolf Clausius introduced the concept of the mean free path. In the same year, James Clerk Maxwell developed the first atomistic theory of transport processes in gases. The modern atomistic theory of diffusion and Brownian motion was developed by Albert Einstein, Marian Smoluchowski and Jean-Baptiste Perrin. Ludwig Boltzmann, in the development of the atomistic backgrounds of the macroscopic transport processes, introduced the Boltzmann equation, which has served mathematics and physics with a source of transport process ideas and concerns for more than 140 years.
In 1920–1921 George de Hevesy measured self-diffusion using radioisotopes. He studied self-diffusion of radioactive isotopes of lead in liquid and solid lead.
Yakov Frenkel (sometimes, Jakov/Jacov Frenkel) proposed, and elaborated in 1926, the idea of diffusion in crystals through local defects (vacancies and interstitial atoms). He concluded, the diffusion process in condensed matter is an ensemble of elementary jumps and quasichemical interactions of particles and defects. He introduced several mechanisms of diffusion and found rate constants from experimental data.
Some time later, Carl Wagner and Walter H. Schottky developed Frenkel's ideas about mechanisms of diffusion further. Presently, it is universally recognized that atomic defects are necessary to mediate diffusion in crystals.
Henry Eyring, with co-authors, applied his theory of absolute reaction rates to Frenkel's quasichemical model of diffusion. The analogy between reaction kinetics and diffusion leads to various nonlinear versions of Fick's law.
Basic models of diffusion.
Diffusion flux.
Each model of diffusion expresses the diffusion flux through concentrations, densities and their derivatives. Flux is a vector formula_1. The transfer of a physical quantity formula_2 through a small area formula_3 with normal formula_4 per time formula_5 is
where formula_7 is the inner product and formula_8 is the little-o notation.
If we use the notation of vector area formula_9 then
The dimension of the diffusion flux is =/(·).
The diffusing physical quantity formula_2 may be the number of particles, mass, energy, electric charge, or any other scalar extensive quantity. For its density, formula_12, the diffusion equation has the form
where formula_14 is intensity of any local source of this quantity (the rate of a chemical reaction, for example).
For the diffusion equation, the no-flux boundary conditions can be formulated as formula_15 on the boundary, where formula_4 is the normal to the boundary at point formula_17.
Fick's law and equations.
Fick's first law: the diffusion flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:
The corresponding diffusion equation (Fick's second law) is
where formula_20 is the Laplace operator,
Onsager's equations for multicomponent diffusion and thermodiffusion.
Fick's law describes diffusion of an admixture in a medium. The concentration of this admixture should be small and the gradient of this concentration should be also small. The driving force of diffusion in Fick's law is the antigradient of concentration, formula_22.
In 1931, Lars Onsager included the multicomponent transport processes in the general context of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics. For
multi-component transport,
where formula_24 is the flux of the "i"th physical quantity (component) and formula_25 is the "j"th thermodynamic force.
The thermodynamic forces for the transport processes were introduced by Onsager as the space gradients of the derivatives of the entropy density "s" (he used the term "force" in quotation marks or "driving force"):
where formula_27 are the "thermodynamic coordinates".
For the heat and mass transfer one can take formula_28 (the density of internal energy) and formula_27 is the concentration of the "i"th component. The corresponding driving forces are the space vectors
where "T" is the absolute temperature and formula_32 is the chemical potential of the "i"th component. It should be stressed that the separate diffusion equations describe the mixing or mass transport without bulk motion. Therefore, the terms with variation of the total pressure are neglected. It is possible for diffusion of small admixtures and for small gradients.
For the linear Onsager equations, we must take the thermodynamic forces in the linear approximation near equilibrium:
where the derivatives of "s" are calculated at equilibrium "n"*.
The matrix of the "kinetic coefficients" formula_34 should be symmetric (Onsager reciprocal relations) and positive definite (for the entropy growth).
The transport equations are
Here, all the indexes "i, j, k"=0,1,2... are related to the internal energy (0) and various components. The expression in the square brackets is the matrix formula_36of the diffusion ("i,k">0), thermodiffusion ("i">0, "k"=0 or "k">0, "i"=0) and thermal conductivity ("i=k"=0) coefficients.
Under isothermal conditions "T"=const. The relevant thermodynamic potential is the free energy (or the free entropy). The thermodynamic driving forces for the isothermal diffusion are antigradients of chemical potentials, formula_37, and the matrix of diffusion coefficients is
("i,k">0).
There is intrinsic arbitrariness in the definition of the thermodynamic forces and kinetic coefficients because they are not measurable separately and only their combinations formula_39 can be measured. For example, in the original work of Onsager the thermodynamic forces include additional multiplier "T", whereas in the Course of Theoretical Physics this multiplier is omitted but the sign of the thermodynamic forces is opposite. All these changes are supplemented by the corresponding changes in the coefficients and do not effect the measurable quantities.
Nondiagonal diffusion must be nonlinear.
The formalism of linear irreversible thermodynamics (Onsager) generates the systems of linear diffusion equations in the form
If the matrix of diffusion coefficients is diagonal then this system of equations is just a collection of decoupled Fick's equations for various components. Assume that diffusion is non-diagonal, for example, formula_41, and consider the state with formula_42. At this state, formula_43. If formula_44 at some points then formula_45 becomes negative at these points in a short time. Therefore, linear non-diagonal diffusion does not preserve positivity of concentrations. Non-diagonal equations of multicomponent diffusion must be non-linear.
Einstein's mobility and Teorell formula.
The Einstein relation (kinetic theory) connects the diffusion coefficient and the mobility (the ratio of the particle's terminal drift velocity to an applied force)
where
"D" is the diffusion constant; "μ" is the "mobility"; "kB" is Boltzmann's constant; "T" is the absolute temperature.
Below, to combine in the same formula the chemical potential "μ" and the mobility, we use for mobility the notation formula_47.
The mobility—based approach was further applied by T. Teorell. In 1935, he studied the diffusion of ions through a membrane. He formulated the essence of his approach in the formula:
This is the so-called "Teorell formula".
The force under isothermal conditions consists of two parts:
Here "R" is the gas constant, "T" is the absolute temperature, "n" is the concentration, the equilibrium concentration is marked by a superscript "eq", "q" is the charge and "φ" is the electric potential.
The simple but crucial difference between the Teorell formula and the Onsager laws is the concentration factor in the Teorell expression for the flux. In the Einstein – Teorell approach, If for the finite force the concentration tends to zero then the flux also tends to zero, whereas the Onsager equations violate this simple and physically obvious rule.
The general formulation of the Teorell formula for non-perfect systems under isothermal conditions is
where "μ" is the chemical potential, "μ"0 is the standard value of the chemical potential.
The expression formula_51 is the so-called activity. It measures the "effective concentration" of a species in a non-ideal mixture. In this notation, the Teorell formula for the flux has a very simple form
The standard derivation of the activity includes a normalization factor and for small concentrations formula_53, where formula_54 is the standard concentration. Therefore this formula for the flux describes the flux of the normalized dimensionless quantity, formula_55,
Teorell formula for multicomponent diffusion.
The Teorell formula with combination of Onsager's definition of the diffusion force gives
where formula_58 is the mobility of the "i"th component, formula_59 is its activity, formula_34 is the matrix of the coefficients, formula_25 is the themodynamic diffusion force, formula_62. For the isothermal perfect systems, formula_63
where "k"B is the Boltzmann constant, "T" is the temperature, "P" is the pressure, formula_64 is the mean free path, and "vT" is the mean thermal speed:
We can see that the diffusion coefficient in the mean free path approximation grows with "T" as "T"3/2 and decreases with "P" as 1/"P". If we use for "P" the ideal gas law "P=RnT" with the total concentration "n", then we can see that for given concentration "n" the diffusion coefficient grows with "T" as "T"1/2 and for given temperature it decreases with the total concentration as "1/n".
For two different gases, A and B, with molecular masses "m"A, "m"B and molecular diameters "d"A, "d"B, the mean free path estimate of the diffusion coefficient of A in B and B in A is:
The theory of diffusion in gases based on Boltzmann's equation.
In Boltzmann's kinetics of the mixture of gases, each gas has its own distribution function, formula_67, where "t" is the time moment, "x" is position and "c" is velocity of molecule of the "i"th component of the mixture. Each component has its mean velocity formula_68. If the velocities formula_69 do not concide then there exists "diffusion".
In the Chapman-Enskog approximation, all the distribution functions are expressed through the densities of the conserved quantities:
The kinetic temperature "T" and pressure "P" are defined in 3D space as
where formula_75 is the total density.
For two gases, the difference between velocities, formula_76 is given by the expression:
where formula_78 is the force applied to the molecules of the "i"th component and formula_79 is the thermodiffusion ratio.
The coefficient "D"12 is positive. This is the diffusion coefficient. Four terms in the formula for "C"1-"C"2 describe four main effects in the diffusion of gases:
All these effects are called "diffusion" because they describe the differences between velocities of different components in the mixture. Therefore, these effects cannot be described as a "bulk" transport and differ from advection or convection.
In the first approximation,
The number formula_87 is defined by quadratures (formulas (3.7), (3.9), Ch. 10 of the classical Chapman and Cowling book)
We can see that the dependence on "T" for the rigid spheres is the same as for the simple mean free path theory but for the power repulsion laws the exponent is different. Dependence on a total concentration "n" for a given temperature has always the same character, 1/"n".
In applications to gas dynamics, the diffusion flux and the bulk flow should be joined in one system of transport equations. The bulk flow describes the mass transfer. Its velocity "V" is the mass average velocity. It is defined through the momentum density and the mass concentrations:
where formula_89 is the mass concentration of the "i"th species, formula_90 is the mass density.
By definition, the diffusion velocity of the "i"th component is formula_91, formula_92.
The mass transfer of the "i"th component is described by the continuity equation
where formula_94 is the net mass production rate in chemical reactions, formula_95.
In these equations, the term formula_96 describes advection of the "i"th component and the term formula_97 represents diffusion of this component.
In 1948, Wendell H. Furry proposed to use the "form" of the diffusion rates found in kinetic theory as a framework for the new phenomenological approach to diffusion in gases. This approach was developed further by F.A. Williams and S.H. Lam. For the diffusion velocities in multicomponent gases ("N" components) they used
Here, formula_101 is the diffusion coefficient matrix, formula_102 is the thermal diffusion coefficient, formula_103 is the body force per unite mass acting on the "i"th species, formula_104 is the partial pressure fraction of the "i"th species (and formula_105 is the partial pressure), formula_106 is the mass fraction of the "i"th species, and formula_107.
Separation of diffusion from convection in gases.
While Brownian motion of multi-molecular mesoscopic particles (like pollen grains studied by Brown) is observable under an optical microscope, molecular diffusion can only be probed in carefully controlled experimental conditions. Since Graham experiments, it is well known that avoiding of convection is necessary and this may be a non-trivial task.
Under normal conditions, molecular diffusion dominates only on length scales between nanometer and millimeter. On larger length scales, transport in liquids and gases is normally due to another transport phenomenon, convection, and to study diffusion on the larger scale, special efforts are needed.
Therefore, some often cited examples of diffusion are "wrong": If cologne is sprayed in one place, it will soon be smelled in the entire room, but a simple calculation shows that this can't be due to diffusion. Convective motion persists in the room because the temperature inhomogeneity. If ink is dropped in water, one usually observes an inhomogeneous evolution of the spatial distribution, which clearly indicates convection (caused, in particular, by this dropping).
In contrast, heat conduction through solid media is an everyday occurrence (e.g. a metal spoon partly immersed in a hot liquid). This explains why the diffusion of heat was explained mathematically before the diffusion of mass.

Who Cares? (ballet)

Who Cares? is a ballet made by New York City Ballet's co-founder and founding choreographer George Balanchine to the songs of George Gershwin in an orchestration by Hershy Kay. The premiere took place on Saturday, February 7, 1970, at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center with costumes by Barbara Karinska and lighting by Ronald Bates; it was at first performed with without décor but from November 1970 with scenery by Jo Mielziner. 
The conductor was Robert Irving and the pianist on opening night Gordon Boelzner; the orchestration had only been completed for two songs, "Strike Up the Band" and "I Got Rhythm". "Clap Yo' Hands" was performed to a recording made by George Gershwin; this sequence was, however, eliminated by Balanchine in 1976; new costumes were commissioned from Ben Benson by Balanchine before his death and have been used since 1983.
Balanchine and Gershwin's plans to collaborate were frustrated by the composer's untimely death in 1937. Thirty-three years later, Balanchine chose seventeen of Gershwin's from Broadway musical songs for this ballet; Mayor John V. Lindsay presented Balanchine with the Handel Medallion, New York City's highest cultural award, on opening night.

Council of Osteopathic Student Government Presidents

The Council of Osteopathic Student Government Presidents (COSGP) was established in 1972 as an official council of the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) to serve as the official national representative voting voice of osteopathic medical students. There are currently 29 colleges of osteopathic medicine, with 37 campuses nationwide that offer the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree. The council includes a student representatives from each of these schools. COSGP serves as a national voting body within AACOM and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and represents the collective voice of osteopathic medical students.
Purpose and Goals.
The main purposes of COSGP are to foster the exchange of ideas, information, and problem-solving for issues that affect individual colleges of osteopathic medicine, and to effectively communicate and represent the osteopathic medical student perspective to professional and educational organizations such as AACOM and AOA. 
Further efforts of COSGP are focused on professional development and leadership, and to support the principles and pride of osteopathic medicine among osteopathic medical students and the public.
The COSGP is governed by an executive board, which is elected during the April Quarterly meeting and consists of six members elected by the General Council Members: Chair, First Vice Chair, Second Vice Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, and Parliamentarian. In addition to the executive board, five Representative Officers are appointed: Legislative Affairs, Medical Education, Research, Programs, and Public Relations and Website. Student Government Presidents of the 29 osteopathic medical schools comprise the general council of the COSGP.
Activities.
The COSGP Student Services Committee coordinates selection of the Student DO of the Year (SDOY) at each college of osteopathic medicine as well as a national winner. The national SDOY winner receives a $1000 scholarship and recognition of the COSGP. The winners of SDOY from each osteopathic medical school are announced in April and will be recognized at both the AACOM Annual Meeting, in April, and the AOA House of Delegates in July, respectively.
Another program, started in 2004, the Translating Osteopathic Understanding into Community Health (TOUCH) program encourages and recognizes Osteopathic medical students who participate in community service. All students who participate in at least 50 hours over the course of a school year receive an official TOUCH pin.
In addition, each year in conjunction with the AOA Convention, COSGP sponsors a Student Seminar. Past seminar speakers include Senator Joe Heck, DO, from the Nevada State Senate, who spoke about "Leadership and Political Activity as a Physician," and Jay Kirkham, OMS II from AZCOM, and a former lobbyist on Capitol Hill, who spoke about the 2008 Presidential Election regarding each candidate's views on healthcare.
Finally, in memory of the passengers aboard Flight 5966, the COSGP encourages events to be held on all campuses and throughout communities in order to honor all those who exemplify compassion and humanism, and those who inspire others to do the same during the Day of Compassion in October annually.
In 2011, the Student Government Council passed a resolution through the AOA House of Delegates to increase awareness about depression amongst medical students, as their heavy workloads and high stress levels contribute to higher rates of depression than the general population. The resolution aims to help medical students connect with resources for preventing and treating depression. Also in 2011, the Student Government Council passed a resolution through the AOA House of Delegates to commit to establishing and supporting tobacco-free osteopathic medical college campuses.

1994 IndyCar season

The 1994 IndyCar season, the sixteenth in the CART era of U.S. open-wheel racing, comprised 16 races, beginning in Surfers Paradise, Queensland, Australia on March 20 and concluding in Monterey, California on October 9. The PPG Indy Car World Series Drivers' Champion and Indianapolis 500 winner was Al Unser, Jr. Rookie of the Year was Jacques Villeneuve. The 78th Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC, but counted in the CART points standings.
Overview.
The 1994 season was memorable for four main reasons: the dominance of Team Penske's PC-23 chassis, the retirement of the great Mario Andretti, the return of Michael Andretti after his unsuccessful season in Formula One, and the rise of young Canadian Jacques Villeneuve.
Drivers and teams.
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1994 Indy Car World Series season. All teams used Goodyear tyres; Firestone would return one year later after a hiatus lasting for two decades.
Overview Part Two: Race Reports.
Round Twelve: New Hampshire.
Emerson Fittipaldi took his first pole in nearly a year. At the start, eighth place starter Adrian Fernandez spun across the track without contact. But in an effort to avoid him, Jacques Villeneuve and Arie Luyendyk crashed and were done for the day before taking the green flag, thus failing to start the race. Robby Gordon spun harmlessly. Luyendyk blamed the crash on the top qualifiers for bringing the field perhaps too slowly to the green flag. The resulting 25 car starting field was the smallest of the year, showing the strength of the sport at the time. A scary crash on Lap 13 involved Mike Groff and former Trans-Am champion Scott Sharp. Groff spun exiting Turn 2 and hit the outside wall; just behind him, Sharp spun to avoid him and was propelled by his kinetic energy onto Groff's nose. His car was launched into the air and flipped once and a half, leaving the Connecticut native hanging upside down in the car for approximately two minutes. The rookie was flipped carefully onto his wheels and walked away unharmed.

Transylvania Twist

Transylvania Twist is a 1989 comedy film that parodies horror movies. Originally released by Concorde Pictures, this film is distributed on home video by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In the film Angus Scrimm reprises his role of the "Tall Man" from the Phantasm movies, as a parody. The humor of the film is most often said to be in the style of Airplane!, and Mel Brooks comedies. It occasionally breaks the Fourth wall rule with characters looking at the camera, and one even saying "I'm in the wrong movie." The film's main theme has been released on a variety of albums, it and the entire soundtrack was released on CD and as a direct download in the year 2010, twenty-one years after the movies initial release.
Plot summary.
The film opens with two short sequences before the main story line begins, first a prologue, and then a mock television advertisement. In the prologue, a seemingly helpless young woman is pursued by Jason Voorhees, Leatherface, and Freddy Krueger; she is then chased into a cave and reappears a few seconds later with an item from each of the three. She then faces the camera and laughs (showing her fangs) and says, "Amateurs!" The advertisement sequence is for a "mortuary, crematory, cemetery" called "Death City" where a salesman tries selling viewers "new and used coffins, with the help of his assistant Lovely Rita."
Dexter Ward (Steve Altman) enters a 'Death City' location, and is greeted by two morticians, one of which is noted science fiction anthologist Forrest J. Ackerman in a cameo appearance, who is holding a copy of Famous Monsters of Filmland. Dexter is there for the funeral of his uncle, who is suffering from a 'medical condition' and not actually dead. After helping his uncle out of the coffin and back to a library, Dexter is then sent by his uncle Ephram (Jay Robinson) to find and bring back "The Book of Ulthar", a book of great power capable of unleashing terrible evil in the wrong hands; librarian Ephram had mistakenly let someone check it out. Dexter's search leads him to aspiring singing star Marissa Orlock (Teri Copley), who is about to be informed of the death of her father Marinas (Howard Morris), and her inheritance of Castle Orlock in Transylvania. Dexter goes with her to the castle.
Victor Van Helsing (Ace Mask), a professional vampire hunter, accompanies Marissa and Dexter to the castle as the executor of her father's estate. Count Byron Orlock (Robert Vaughn), and his three adopted-daughters who are also vampires are already at the castle. One of them is named Patricia (Monique Gabrielle) the seemingly helpless girl in the prologue. When 'viewing the will' they find out that Marissa has been left the castle and the money, while Orlock was left luggage. As a toss-up gift, they are left to find the book somewhere within the castle. Orlock is determined to find the book so that he can create an age of evil; assisting him is the butler Stephan (Angus Scrimm).
The book is finally found by Dexter but Byron steals it from him and uses it to summon an enormous monster called The Evil One (which was originally seen in "It Conquered the World"), but Dexter and Marissa (who is possessed by her ancestor of the same name) stops him, while Dexter is freed and destroys the book. The possessed Marissa blasts Byron with a lightning bolt, but as he burns to death he declares that he'll be back in the sequel.
Marinas, who was suffering from a cataleptic seizure and was not dead, tells Marissa that she must stay in the castle to ensure that the monster never returns; Helsing, who is now a vampire, also stays. Dexter arranges for Marissa to make her latest music video in the castle, with the help of her vampire cousins and Helsing.
The film ends with the local villagers, who throughout the movie have been trying to find the castle so they can destroy it, finally give up and go home.
Inspirations, parodies, and puns.
Most of the movie consists of silly moments of comedy and parody; e.g., when Pinhead steps out of an acupuncturist's office and says, "I don't care what anyone says — this hurts!" At one point, Dexter looks into a room and meets Boris Karloff (in a clip from the movie "The Terror"); in another, Dexter and Marissa step into a room that's apparently in 3-D, but because neither of them is wearing 3-D glasses, all they see is jumbled red and green. As a parody of 3-D films.
Many of the films characters are parodies of from other sources, including; Dexter Ward from The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, Byron Orlock from Targets, Van Helsing from Dracula, and the mock advertisement scene's Lovely Rita. Television shows are also referenced such as The Honeymooners, The Late Show, Meet the Press, The Twilight Zone, and Wheel of Fortune. While others are puns or such as "Vampires of the Caribbean", "Elvis has left the body", and "Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow" being spoken as part of the spell to summon the Evil One. The film also uses such classics as a Pie in the face for the Ayatollah, and Dexter finding a Skeleton in the closet.
Films being parodied are: Nightmare on Elm Street" the character "Freddy Krueger" with Swiss Army knife glove. Casablanca (film), the lines "You talking to me, no one else here you must be talking to me" (Taxi Driver (film)), The Exorcist" at the séance scene, including the spewing of green liquid from the mouth. Friday the 13th" films the character Jason Voorhees. The Haunted Palace the summoning of the 'Evil One' scenes. Hellraiser the character Pinhead. Horror of Dracula" meeting the daughters, Van Helsing pointing out blood on a vampire's mouth, and Byron throwing back of female vampire from her intended victim. It Conquered the World the 'Evil One' creature. Night of the Living Dead the lines "Yeah, they're dead--they're all messed up." Phantasm the 'Tall Man' character with "Angus Scrimm" parodying himself in the role. Taxi Driver the taxi drivers comments. Texas Chainsaw Massacre" films character Leatherface. The Terror" footage of Boris Karloff.
Home video.
This movie has been released on VHS videocassette on September 22, 1993 and on DVD on March 27, 2001, both of which are currently out of print. The DVD separates the story into twenty-four scene chapters with the following titles;
Reception.
The film received mixed reviews, from positive reviews such as "what might be the best of the late-80′s wave of Naked Gun inspired horror spoofs." To the more negative reviews that state "Moronic comedy about vampires, teenage vampire hunters and half-naked babes." One of its most positive reviews comes from Variety stating that; "Mixed into the cosmic stew are many delightful reflexive bits," and that it "is an occasionally hilarious horror spoof notable for the range of its comical targets."
Soundtrack.
After the movies original release its theme was released as part of the album "Vampire Circus (The Essential Vampire Theme Collection)" by Silva Screen Records in 1993. On the 1997 album "Vampire Themes" by Cleopatra Records, the band 'Ex Voto' remixes and reinterprets the main theme. The entire soundtrack was then officially released on June 7, 2010, when it was paired with the soundtrack to Not of This Earth (1988 film) also composed by Chuck Cirino. It is currently sold in Compact Disk, and Direct download formats from various music sites.

Japanese weasel

The Japanese weasel ("Mustela itatsi") is a carnivorous mammal belonging to the genus "Mustela" in the family Mustelidae. It is native to Japan where it occurs on the islands of Honshū, Kyūshū and Shikoku. It has been introduced to Hokkaidō and the Ryukyu Islands to control rodents and has also been introduced to Sakhalin island in Russia.
It is often classified as a subspecies of the Siberian weasel ("M. sibirica"). The two species are very similar in appearance but differ in the ratio of tail length to head and body length. There are also genetic differences which suggest that the two diverged around 1.6-1.7 million years ago. Their ranges now overlap in western Japan where the Siberian weasel has been introduced.
Adult males of the Japanese weasel can reach in body length with a tail length of up to . Females are smaller. The fur is orange-brown with darker markings on the head. The species typically occurs in mountainous or forested areas near water. Its diet includes mice, frogs, reptiles, insects and crayfish.

Ogden–Weber Applied Technology College

Ogden–Weber Applied Technology College (also referred to as Ogden-Weber Tech College or OWATC) is a technical college located in Ogden, Utah, USA. It is the largest of the eight regional campuses that comprise the Utah College of Applied Technology (UCAT). The college offers open-entry, open-exit, competency-based education targeted at technical skills and job placement (also called career and technical education).
History.
The college opened its doors in April 1971. At that time it was known as Skills Center North. The institution helped adult students learn new job skills to attain employment. The student body consisted of 100 students. By 1975, the Utah Board of Regents incorporated Skills Center North as part of Weber State College. Within several years the Center’s training programs had received full state and regional accreditation which opened the door to allowing high school students to attend the Center while completing their high school graduation requirements. The student body grew to exceed 750 adult and high school students (both full-time and part-time). In 1982, the Center was moved under the auspices of the Utah State Office of Education and was renamed the Ogden-Weber Area Vocational Center. The student body grew to over 1,200 students. In 1984, the Center moved its campus to its present day location, formerly the site of the Utah State Industrial School and Ogden Military Academy, to accommodate the need for more classrooms with a steadily increasing student body. The name was changed to the Ogden-Weber Applied Technology Center in the early 1990s.
The then center celebrated its 30-year anniversary in 2001. Over 300 technical courses were being offered at that time. During that year the Utah State Legislature approved the College to be a Utah College of Applied Technology resulting in the institution being designated as a stand-alone campus serving the Ogden-Weber region. The center was renamed the Ogden–Weber Applied Technology College and was approved to grant students Associate of Applied Technology Degrees. The College now serves over 10,000 adult and high school students annually.
Location.
Ogden–Weber Applied Technology College is located in Ogden, Utah. There are additional campuses in Roy, Utah and at Business Depot Ogden.

2008 Zagreb bombing

The 23 October 2008 Zagreb bombing was an attack by a remote-detonation car bomb fitted on a motorcycle outside the Croatian "Nacional" newspaper's premises in the Croatian capital, Zagreb. The attack killed the owner of the newspaper, Ivo Pukanić, and Niko Franjić, its marketing manager, and injured two more people. The explosion occurred in the centre of the capital at 18:10 local time (16:10 GMT). Numerous arrests of suspects around the country followed. A subsequent police investigation accused Croatian and Serbian organized crime groups of perpetrating the bombing. Eight people suspected of having connections to organised crime groups were indicted. Six were later convicted over the murders with prison terms ranging from 15 to 40 years.
Details.
At 18:10 local time, Pukanić approached his Lexus LS 600h L with Niko Franjić, the "Nacional" director of marketing. According to first news report, a bomb placed in the trash can next to the car exploded soon after. However, an October 25 special edition of "Večernji list" dedicated to the bombing put the bomb on a motorcycle parked next to Lexus which then exploded before the two men had a chance to enter the car. Pukanić was instantly killed by the blast while Franjić remained alive for a few more seconds. Two graphic design students from a nearby school were injured by shrapnel. The incident happened on a parking lot in Palmotićeva Street, near Stara Vlaška Street and Josip Lang Square, only two street blocks east of the main Zagreb square, Ban Jelačić Square. Police immediately blocked the traffic around the site of assassination, causing immense traffic jams all over the city center. A man was seen running away from the explosion down Palmotićeva Street. He was described as being in his early thirties, wearing a baseball cap and running with no regard for traffic.
The police have reported finding security camera footage of a possible perpetrator parking the deadly motorcycle. CCTV footage of several suspicious events around the building on the day of the attack, including the footage of the explosion itself, was examined by court and publicly released in March 2010.
Reactions.
In a special press conference the Prime Minister of Croatia Ivo Sanader denounced the attack and declared that he would not allow "Croatia to become Beirut," though he declined a proposal for entering a state of emergency. He further stated that, "This is no longer merely a fight against organized crime... this is something all of us in Croatia will rise up against." Mirjana Pukanić, Ivo's estranged wife with whom he was involved with in a very public scandal earlier in the year, was shocked to find out about the assassination.
The editorial board of Nacional reacted by accusing the police of Pukanić's death by failure to provide police protection. They stated that Pukanić's round-the-clock protection by two police officers was lifted on August 1 not by Pukanić's request in his right mind, but under a pressure from the police. Pukanić allegedly received two death threats after the end of the protection and promptly forwarded them to the police, but they failed to act upon them. The redaction also condemned the prosecution office for investigating false accusations against Pukanić instead of concentrating on finding his April assailant. As of now, there are only informal speculations as to the motive of the assassin.
The media have called for a special anti-mafia operation similar to the Serbian "Saber" Operation concluded after the assassination of the former Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić, which resulted in hundreds of arrests and a substantial decrease of Serbian mafia activities. However, there has been no news so far from the police department as to a possible operation. Such an action was already called for by the Zagreb's influential newspapers after the murder of Ivana Hodak, the daughter of a prominent Zagreb lawyer who was defending a controversial former army general .
Mesić's testimony.
President of Croatia Stjepan Mesić said the attack meant "terrorism has become a fact on the streets of Zagreb." He went on to state Pukanić feared for his life before the accident. According to Mesić's words, Mirjana Pukanić called Mesić to ask Ivo Pukanić to send her some money. Mesić called Ivo and, aside from Mirjana's request, inquired about the police investigation of the April assassination attempt. Pukanić replied that the police have not made much progress since the crime itself, but he added that he was in a great fear for his life. Mesić declared that he was not aware what were the reasons and who were the authors of the threats. He recommended the police to interrogate Mirjana Pukanić, although he did not publicly state what she would be able to say. He also said he would be willing to subject to a police interrogation himself. Mirjana Pukanić was vexed by President Mesić's recommendations and the claim about begging for Ivo Pukanić's money. She stated she has lived in a women's shelter for six months without money, and that she only asked Mesić to speed up the divorce process started by her.
State of emergency.
In a special news conference following the assassination, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader at first declined the possibility of introducing a state of emergency. However, the following day Sanader approved the proposal and ordered 250 additional police officers to the city. He called the killing an "assassination" as he vowed to fight mafia crime that threatens his country's attempt to join the EU. Sanader said the police authority would be widened, trials would be speeded up, and a DNA database for convicted criminals would be created. During the state of emergency, the police would also have the right to confiscate illegally obtained property.
The announcement of the state of emergency was quickly followed by a release of a facial composite of the man from the crime scene and a large police operation, which resulted in 9 arrests in Zagreb and 20 in Rijeka during its first day. The chief of Croatian police, Vladimir Faber, stated all figures from Croatian underground connected to Pukanić will be interrogated.
Background.
The Croatian Journalists' Association has announced that the murder is the first of a journalist in Croatia since the nation's War of Independence. Pukanić has been known as a controversial figure, with close ties to the underworld and to politicians. Croatian media has reported he was a regular guest at all receptions given by president Stjepan Mesić. Pukanić's Nacional was known for uncovering cigarette smuggling schemes involving, among others, a Swiss-based Serbian tycoon Stanko Subotić and the current Prime Minister of Montenegro, Milo Đukanović. Italian Prosecutor Giuseppe Scelsi said that Ivo Pukanić and the murdered Montenegrin journalist Duško Jovanović of "Dan", were among the most important witnesses in the investigation and that the Antimafia Commission will now have to archive the case. Another reason for archiving the investigation is the diplomatic immunity of Milo Đukanović.
Pukanić assassination attempt in April 2008.
Pukanić, an influential and controversial person in Croatian politics, was already targeted in a murder attempt on April 9, 2008 in western downtown Zagreb, near Franjo Tuđman Square. He was shot at with a silenced pistol at close range. Pukanić crouched as the perpetrator pointed his gun at him and successfully dodged the bullet, which created a hole in the window of a nearby gift shop. The perpetrator's gun subsequently jammed, enabling Pukanić to pull his legally-owned Glock 17 out of his bag. Pukanić fired a warning shot, causing the perpetrator to flee the crime scene. A facial composite of the perpetrator, who was unmasked and wore a dark knitted cap, was publicly released five days after the attack.
The police suspected the attempt to be a warning to Pukanić, intended to discourage him from certain activities. Police protection was assigned to Pukanić immediately following the event. However, it was lifted on August 1, 2008, just over two and a half months before the October 23 bombing, as there were no further threats in the months following the assassination attempt.
2008 Zagreb crime wave.
The bombing was quickly associated by the media with the increased occurrence of crime in Zagreb in 2008. The crime wave gained its role in media with the Ribnjak Park killing of an 18-year-old Bad Blue Boys football fan in March, followed by a retaliation by other BBB members. A mob beating with deadly consequences at a bus stop in the high-traffic Većeslav Holjevac Avenue ensued.
The latest in the stream of crime events was the murder of Ivana Hodak, the daughter of Zvonimir Hodak, the lawyer who defended alleged war profiteer general Vladimir Zagorec. The murder caused the Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to fire Marijan Benko, chief of Zagreb Police Department, Berislav Rončević, Minister of Internal Affairs and Ana Lovrin, Minister of Justice. Rončević was replaced by Tomislav Karamarko and Lovrin by Ivan Šimonović. However, this case was in February 2009 attributed by the police to a homeless unemployed man blaming Zvonimir Hodak for his problems in life.
Police investigation.
The police released information that the possible assassin is Sretko Kalinić, a wanted executioner of the recently dissolved Zemun clan of Serbian mafia, who was in January 2008 sentenced "in absentia" to 40 years of prison in Serbia for eight assassinations and involvement in numerous other criminal activities including two abductions. His current whereabouts remain unknown, aside from having been spotted in Croatia the week before the bombing. There are reports that he was recently involved in other murders in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The police have also talked to Mirjana Pukanić, while Nacional editorial board refuted a claim that they plan to accuse her for the assassination. On October 27, Croatian police arrested many former police officers and members of the army in a countrywide action, who are suspected to be capable of producing such professional explosive device that was used in the bombing. On October 29, Croatian police arrested 10 people in direct connection to the murder whom the police official Krunoslav Borovec described as "dangerous members of a criminal milieu."
Serbian mafia.
On October 30 police arrested five suspects aligned with the Serbian mobster Sreten "Joca Amsterdam" Jocić for Pukanić's assassination. The suspects were Robert and Luka Matanić, Amir Mafalani, Slobodan "Boban" Đurović and Milenko "Mića" Kuzmanović. Mafalani was arrested in his apartment and the other four were arrested on the Bajakovo border crossing, trying to escape Croatia.
The day before the All Saints Day police filed all points bulletins and subsequently arrested two known Serbian mobsters and criminals, Bojan "Bajone" Gudurić and Željko "Letač" Milovanović. Milovanović is known in Serbia for robbing a post office in Beočin (near Novi Sad, Serbia) in 2005. After the robbery he escaped the police. He was subsequently tracked and arrested in front of a Tuzla hospital. However, Milovanović made another spectacular escape a few days later, while being transported to a medical examination. Bojan Gudurić is known for having committed over 15 armed robberies all over Vojvodina while leading an organized crime group. His most publicized robbery was the robbery of the Ekspres Gas company in Novi Sad, where he and several of his masked accomplices forcibly took money from the company safe by threatening workers and staff by pistols.
Croatian organized crime.
Days after the arrest and after a scandal involving Luka Pilipović, the attorney representing Matanić cousings and Mafalani, Robert Matanić offered a testimony to uncover the contractors of the assassination. He testified that Milovanović and Gudurić organized the assassination and that he, his cousin and Mafalani assisted them in preparations for the assassination. Mafalani allegedly obtained an apartment at the intersection of Petrinjska Street and Jurišićeva Street, a high-traffic location in the vicinity of the crime scene. Robert was assisted by Velimir "Žvaki" Žaka in obtaining several stolen cars and the bomb-fitted motorcycle for Gudurić and Milovanović. Gudurić, a known criminal monitored by the Balkans police forces, used a false name to rent the Jurišićeva Street apartment.
Matanić stated he was at first unaware of the actual target and that he realized that Pukanić was the victim only a few days after Milovanović mentioned the target to him using Pukanić's nickname "Puki." He also declared he was not present during the assassination, claiming a BMW 7 Series presentation in a car dealership in Folnegovićevo naselje as his alibi. Matanić also arranged the escape of Milovanović and Gudurić to Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, only Milovanović's escape was successful, as Gudurić took off a day later and was subsequently caught by the police. A media scandal arose from Milovanović's escape, as Bosnian police accused Croatian media of a premature release of information, thus allegedly tipping of the perpetrators.

<doc id="19908782" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19908782" title="Caitlin Todd">
Caitlin Todd

Special Agent Caitlin "Kate" Todd is a fictional character in the CBS drama "NCIS", and was portrayed by actress Sasha Alexander.
She was introduced in the show's first episode "Yankee White", replacing Robyn Lively's character Vivian Blackadder, who had appeared in the "JAG" Season 8 episodes "Ice Queen" and "Meltdown." Blackadder was written out of the show after test audiences viewing the two episodes reacted very negatively to her, resulting in the character of Kate Todd being created when "NCIS" went into regular production.
First encountered by the team as a United States Secret Service special agent assigned to the Presidential Protection Detail on Air Force One, she was promptly recruited by senior special agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs at the end of the first episode following her resignation from the USSS for breaking the rules about not dating a colleague or having a relationship with them.
She quickly became a key member of the Gibbs-led Major Case Response Team (MCRT) based at the NCIS headquarters in Washington, DC.
At the end of Season 2, in the last few seconds of the finale "Twilight", she was killed in the line of duty, having been shot in the head by rogue Mossad member Ari Haswari following Sasha Alexander's decision to leave the show.
She was later replaced by Ziva David, played by Chilean actress Cote de Pablo.
Background.
Not much is known about Agent Todd's origins, except for the fact that she originally came from Indiana, had three brothers whom she mentioned as being "practically psychotic" and an elder sister (introduced as Rachel Cranston in Season 8 Episode 14 "A Man Walks Into a Bar..."), and was Catholic. She also mentioned having a cousin named Maureen Ingalls. She was canonically in her late twenties.
Education and work history.
She went to college in the 1990s, first studying law to become a lawyer but dropped out after a single year, having felt like she had spent "10 years in prison". During her years at college she won a wet T-shirt contest in 1994, during her Spring Break vacation in Panama City Beach, Florida which her colleague, Tony DiNozzo, used a source of amusement and possible blackmail material in "Conspiracy Theory".
Some time after college, she joined the United States Secret Service, and was eventually assigned to the President's security detail aboard Air Force One. Viewing her job as very demanding, she didn't have the time to meet someone outside of work, and started a romantic relationship with the Marine assigned as carrier of the presidential "Nuclear Football", Timothy Kerry, thereby breaking the Secret Service's rules which prohibit relationships between colleagues.
At the end of the first episode "Yankee White", she resigned from the Secret Service before her superiors either sacked or fired her for disobeying the fraternization rules; NCIS Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs recruited Todd almost immediately after she quit and assigned her to his team where she became an NCIS Special Agent and the third member of Gibbs' team, pairing her with special agent Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo.
As a member on NCIS's MCRT, Todd became the team's dedicated profiler and created psychological profiles on the suspects being investigated, a role that Dr. Donald Mallard later took over, having gained a psychology degree. She enjoyed working on the NCIS team although as a new person to the group, she was first taken aback by their apparent disregard for the rules and protested at times, yet she came to find herself bending rules like Gibbs and DiNozzo to get the information they needed to trap some suspect or another.
For example, in the episode "A Weak Link", she suggested they hack into a system to get the information they needed for a particular case. Other of Caitlin Todd's skills included counterfeit bill analysis and protection detail, which she acquired during her time as a U.S. Secret Service Special Agent.
Characterization.
Todd was portrayed as professional and as a talented agent, with great profiling skills and artistic talents. At the beginning of Season 1, she was often shown to be surprised by the rule-breaking tendencies that her colleagues performed but eventually adhered to them. She also seemed to get emotionally attached to victims as seen in the episodes "The Immortals" and especially "Left For Dead", when she befriended a Jane Doe who had memory loss after being buried alive in a grave. It was later revealed, however, that the Jane Doe had actually been deceiving Todd all along and she later killed herself and her lover, with the aftermath leaving Kate emotionally scarred for some time.
Her attitude contrasted vastly with DiNozzo's behavior, and they routinely argued over matters of privacy and personal boundaries: throughout the first two seasons, Todd was the prime target of DiNozzo's nosing, with the latter sneaking through her purse, cellphone, PDA and desktop computer on a regular basis, which infuriated her to no end. DiNozzo even went through Kate's trash to discover where she'd eaten breakfast much to her chargin in "Doppelganger".
Whereas Todd considered this outrageous and unacceptable, DiNozzo seemingly merely did this for his personal entertainment. However, DiNozzo had also been the target of numerous taunts and regular teasing from Todd as well.
It was also revealed in the Season 2 episode, "Witness" that Kate had a phobia of going to the dentist but she eventually overcame it thanks to Tony giving her the number of a hypnotist.
A talented sketch artist, she sketched an accurate likeness of a suspect in the episode "Marine Down". During the same episode, it was shown that she had drawn caricatures of the team, some of which showed DiNozzo lusting after a pretty girl and Abby Sciuto as a bat. She also drew one of Gibbs as well, but managed to take her drawing pad back from DiNozzo before he revealed it.
In addition to being excellent at drawing, Todd, like Abby, was greatly skilled in using a Personal digital assistant or a PDA. Kate's first PDA was destroyed during a practice test at the shooting range at the beginning of Season 1 episode "Marine Down" after Gibbs taped it onto her target to force her to shoot accurately. It had to be discarded as the warranty did not cover damage caused by bullets. She was later seen using a possible replacement in "Eye Spy" and was always seen with one at various crime scenes, usually giving Gibbs or the team information.
Despite being seen writing things with her right hand, Todd was seen operating her computer mouse with her left hand, suggesting that she might be ambidextrous.
In season three, when Ziva David joined the team full-time and moved into Todd's cubicle, she presented Gibbs with Todd's sketch pad. There were portraits of each cast member in it, including Gibbs.
Todd had an opportunity to kill Ari when he broke into the NCIS autopsy lab in "Bête Noire" and shot Gerald in the shoulder, but found she was unable to do so. Gibbs later chastized her for this. In "Kill Ari (Part I)," during a discussion with Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard in the morgue, Todd, who had been shot dead in the previous episode, explained that she had not been able to kill Ari because she had looked into his eyes and that there had been something kind in them. She also expressed regret at not killing Ari when she had the chance because in her opinion, Todd knew that she did not deserve to die.
Death.
Todd's year and a half long career as an NCIS Special Agent came to an abrupt and tragic end when in the last few seconds of the Season 2 finale, "Twilight" (canonically on May 24, 2005), after she and the team had successfully cleared a warehouse, shooting all the terrorists in sight, Kate herself died after being shot through the head which left a bullet-shaped hole in its wake and killed her instantly with Gibbs and DiNozzo as witnesses to Kate's murder.
The murderer was revealed as the team's old enemy, terrorist and double agent Ari Haswari, who had targeted and killed her merely because he wanted to cause Gibbs pain (even using a Bravo 51 nicknamed "Kate"); the remaining members of the team were left completely shellshocked and numb by Kate's brutal murder and struggled to come to terms with her death, Abby being the one who took the situation pretty hard as she and Kate had been friends since the very beginning of Kate's career as an NCIS Special Agent.
Seeking revenge against Ari, Gibbs solely embarked on a vengeful quest to find and kill Ari during the events of "Kill Ari" Parts I & II. Ari was eventually shot by his own half-sister, Mossad officer Ziva David, who later filled the void left in the team by Todd's death. Although at first the team wasn't too happy about Ziva replacing Todd, they later grew to accept her. At the end of the episode "Kill Ari (Part II)", the remaining members of the MCRT, along with Dr. Mallard and Abby Sciuto, bid a sad farewell to Todd while reminiscing happier times as she was laid to rest with civilian honors. During Gibbs' vision of Todd in her coffin, it was revealed that she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom
After her death, Todd was occasionally referenced in later episodes:
Relationships.
Special Agent in Charge Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
Although they conflicted heavily upon their first meeting in "Yankee White", Todd had a great relationship with Gibbs. Gibbs immediately saw her potential as a special agent and hired her right after she resigned from the Secret Service. Despite difficult beginnings during which Todd resented Gibbs' harshness and rude manners (such as hanging up on her), she had a lot of respect for Gibbs and worked well with him. He was her mentor and believed that she was a great agent; in "Sub Rosa", Gibbs brought Todd with him aboard a U.S. Navy "Los Angeles"-class attack submarine even though women are considered "problematic" aboard submarines; in order to bring Todd with him, Gibbs didn't hesitate to argue with Norfolk's sub squadron commander.
Keeping with his tendency to know "everything about everyone", Gibbs knew what the tattoo Todd had on her back represented and was apparently the first to identify Dr. Rachel Cranston as Todd's sister in "A Man Walks Into a Bar...".
Confronted with Todd's death, a shocked and vengeful Gibbs found himself overwhelmed with guilt and, like the rest of the protagonists, began having visions of her. His first visions of Todd blamed him for her death and angrily demanded to know why she was killed instead of him, even suggesting that Gibbs should commit suicide. After he avenged her death by having Ari killed, however, he had another vision of her at her funeral in which she seemed to have forgiven him, smiling and jokingly telling him "You're late for my funeral, Gibbs".
Senior Field Special Agent Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo.
Todd's relationship with her fellow co-worker Tony DiNozzo could be referred to as a sibling love-hate relationship as they had arguments usually in various levels of maturity. The two constantly competed, both during training and investigations. Todd was often critical of DiNozzo's behaviour, especially concerning his attitude towards women and his disrespect for personal boundaries; indeed, DiNozzo routinely went through Todd's purse, cellphone, PDA and desktop computer, uncovering personal informations such as her dates' identities. In one episode, DiNozzo sneaked unbeknownst to her into the bathroom while she was having a shower in order to brush his teeth, which infuriated her when she noticed him. However, it was not uncommon for DiNozzo to be teased and taunted by Todd, especially after DiNozzo kissed a female suspect who was, unbeknownst to him, a transsexual; their bickering got so bad in the episode "Pop Life" that they sought counseling from Dr. Mallard.
Despite her dislike of Tony's habit of trespassing her privacy, they get along at work, with Tony frequently explaining military slang to her. They also "gang up" against McGee when he first joined the team by letting him to some of the more mundane jobs. In the Season 2 episode "Forced Entry" they tricked McGee into drinking Gibbs' coffee, which is a well-known taboo.
However, on many occasions DiNozzo was shown being considerate, kind and even borderline romantic to Todd. He bought her flowers as a peace offering after annoying her in the episode "Vanished". He showed concern for her several times, including at the end of episodes "Left For Dead", when she realized she had been played by a victim, and "Bête Noire", when she was held hostage by Ari. In the episode "The Bone Yard", DiNozzo was almost possessive of Todd when McGee posed the idea of pretending to be Todd's lover to get into a paternity clinic to photograph evidence for Sciuto, saying he would do it instead of McGee; later in the same episode, he told Todd he thought they made a good couple, to which she replied "Maybe for "The Jerry Springer Show"". In the episode "Black Water", he went close to jealousy when Todd accepted a date offered by the victim's brother. During the events of "My Other Left Foot", DiNozzo was obsessed by the idea of Todd having a tattoo and asked to know where during the whole episode. In extras seen on the Season 2 DVD Box Set, the producers stated it was intended for there to be a relationship between these two characters. When DiNozzo was posing as a criminal in "Chained", Todd showed much concern for his safety. In the episode "SWAK", after Todd was found to be uninfected, she continued to stay with DiNozzo, lying to him about her condition even though she knew that the risk of infection was still imminent. As he was apparently about to die, Todd was devastated and started crying; DiNozzo eventually survived, much to her relief.
Standing with Gibbs and Todd when she was killed, DiNozzo was especially shocked and her death would have a serious impact on him, which along with other events made him "grow up" during the following seasons. As shown in the episodes "Kill Ari" I & II, DiNozzo struggled with sorrow, culminating in a scene in which he and McGee mourn over Todd's dead body in Dr. Mallard's autopsy room. He finally came in terms with her death after her funeral.
After Todd's death, like the other characters, DiNozzo also had a vision of her postmortem. Typical to DiNozzo's chauvinistic personality, Todd appeared in the Catholic schoolgirl uniform that he had been asking about in the episode "Bikini Wax". After telling him that she always knew what he was thinking, she realized that she was wearing the uniform and quickly berated him, saying "Tony, I just died, and you're having a sexual fantasy?" to which he replied, "Can't help it. Sometimes I used to picture you naked" and she responded by screaming in shock seconds before Ziva David was introduced for the first time. This "sexual fantasy" was portrayed after DiNozzo offered to go back out in the pouring rain and find the bullet that killed Todd and became upset when McGee improved the answer he had told to Gibbs. In the Season 8 episode "A Man Walks Into a Bar...", Todd's sister Rachel suggests to DiNozzo that Todd was "hard on because she knew what [he was really capable of".
In the 200th episode, "Life Before His Eyes", one of several alternate reality scenarios featured Kate surviving, marrying DiNozzo, and having a child with him.
Probationary Special Agent Timothy "Tim" McGee.
When McGee was introduced in "Sub Rosa", Todd protested at DiNozzo's apparent abuse of authority when he ordered McGee to stay on a crime scene until someone else can come to relieve him. Todd and McGee were partnered for a very short time during the episode "UnSEALed", during which he came to her help when she was tied up by a former Navy SEAL.
Throughout Season 2, DiNozzo and Todd would sometimes gang up on McGee to tease him, but Todd generally disapproved of DiNozzo's pranks and hazing of McGee. After the murder of a witness under McGee's watch, Todd was the first to try to comfort him.
After Todd's death, like the grief-stricken rest of the team, McGee had to cope with the loss of a friend, and like DiNozzo would fantasize about her. Later, McGee is shown mourning with DiNozzo over Todd's dead body.
Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard.
In "Yankee White", Dr. Mallard was the first NCIS member who got along with Todd. The two liked each other very much and genuinely cared for each other, as seen in several episodes including "Reveille" and "The Meat Puzzle".
In the latter, Gibbs assigned Todd as Dr. Mallard's protection detail when his life was threatened by a criminal. As he does with other team members, Dr. Mallard would usually call Todd by her full name, Caitlin just like her future murderer, Ari Haswari did.
Todd's death was a severe blow to Dr. Mallard, who wouldn't let anyone else perform the autopsy on her dead body. Before he started, however, he had a vision of the body speaking to him, declaring she felt she didn't deserve to die. In the Season 8 episode "A Man Walks Into a Bar...", Dr. Mallard has a flashback to this vision while speaking to Dr. Rachel Cranston.
Forensic Specialist Abigail "Abby" Sciuto.
As with Dr. Mallard, Todd and Sciuto got along very well pretty fast, ultimately becoming close friends. They would often make plans together, such as spending the weekend together at a spa.
Also, as seen during "A Weak Link", Abby was seen talking to Kate and asking for advice about her relationship with McGee after he had confessed to the Goth that he liked her, leaving her unsure of how to respond to the comment.
Naturally, she was one of the most deeply affected by Todd's death, but regained composure after being cheered up by a post-mortem, goth vision of Todd. She later played a jazz music record at Todd's funeral, as part of her own New Orleans heritage. Nevertheless, she remained affected long after the funeral, and was initially at odds with the newly recruited Ziva David, both because she took Todd's place and because of her affiliation with Todd's murderer Ari Haswari. Some time later, however, they mended fences, becoming best friends.
In the episode "Marine Down", it was revealed that Todd had drawn several caricatures of her teammates, including one of Sciuto as a vampire bat. Todd started to apologize, saying that there was nothing mean in the drawing, only to be interrupted by an overjoyed Sciuto who asked if she could hang it up on her lab's wall. When Kate died, Abby used the drawing as a reminder about her best friend Kate. She would later stare at it while crying in the aftermath of Todd's death in "Kill Ari (Part I)".

Stanbic Bank 20 Series

The Stanbic Bank Twenty20 formerly known as the Metropolitan Bank Twenty20 is the domestic Twenty20 cricket competition in Zimbabwe. It was formed in 2007 and maintained by Zimbabwe Cricket. It features all the national and domestic players from Zimbabwe and some international stars. The best players in this tournament will form as Zimbabwe Chevrons to play in the Standard Bank Pro 20 Series in South Africa. Recently, the tournament has risen in profile with some high-quality cricket, and the attraction of major international stars such as Brian Lara, Ryan Sidebottom, Chris Gayle, Shaun Tait, Ian Harvey, and Dirk Nannes. The tournament particularly rose in profile after the reorganization of cricket in Zimbabwe. It was so successful in the 2009–10 season (the inaugural edition after the rename of the tournament) that the tournament was again held in November. In 2009–10, a domestic-cricket record 7500 spectators came into the Harare Sports Club to see the final between Mountaineers and Mashonaland Eagles. Mountaineers is the current champion defeating Mashonaland Eagles in the 2011–12 Stanbic Bank 20 Series Final. It is currently sponsored by Stanbic Bank (Uganda) Limited.
Tournament history.
2006–07 season.
The inaugural edition of the Metropolitan Bank Twenty20 series was held in early 2007, however sadly the scorecards were never made available, so for the players that participated in this tournament, their statistics would not have been officially recorded.
Many of the countries top cricketers were not able to take part in the tournament as they were competing in the ICC World Cup in the West Indies, however many of the second tier players such as Timycen Maruma – who had played in Zimbabwe's only official Twenty20 to date, against the Eagles in South Africa – and Blessing Mahwire did take part.
The tournament took place in the eastern border city of Mutare.
2007–08 season.
The 2008 season was held between 19–21 March 2008. The tournament kicked off the provincial domestic season, and featured all of the countries top cricketers. Easterns were the dominant team of the tournament, and there was some concern that Zimbabwe Cricket had placed the countries top players, such as Hamilton Masakadza, Prosper Utseya, Stuart Matsikenyeri and Timycen Maruma, in this team to show there is depth outside of the urban centres. However, Northerns province, who featured Brendan Taylor, Elton Chigumbura, Ray Price, Tatenda Taibu and Graeme Cremer, were arguably a stronger side, and they didn't make it to the finals, suggesting perhaps that the claims were unfounded.
The tournament featured several names from the past, such as fast bowler Ian Nicolson (Southerns), batsman Malcolm Waller (Centrals) and bowler Brian Vitori (Southerns). However there were several noticeable missing faces, such as Khawaluni Ntuil, the Westerns fast bowler, Freedom Takarusenga, the Westerns all-rounder, and Kyle Jarvis, the under 19's fast bowler who was unlucky to miss out on a place in the Northerns squad.
The three-day tournament was held in Harare, with matches being shared between Harare Sports Club and the Country Club (Zimbabwe Cricket Academy). The first 2 days saw four matches being played, two in the morning with one at each venue, and two in the afternoon with one at each venue again. The final day had a regular morning routine, but instead of the typical two afternoon matches, it was just the final match at Harare Sports Club.
Easterns maintained their increasing strangehold in domestic cricket with a 7-run win over Westerns at Harare Sports Club, Harare. Eastern's total of 142/9 was almost entirely down to Hamilton Masakadza's 57-ball 82 not out, and the partnership with his younger brother Shingirai Masakadza, was the only partnership of note. Westerns were on course when Keith Dabengwa (42) and Greg Strydom (38) were adding 62 for the third wicket but Prosper Utseya then put the brakes on the innings and the last five wickets fell for 27 runs. Easterns now had won all the major tournaments: The Logan Cup, The Faithwear Cup, and the Metropolitan Bank Twenty20. Unsurprisingly, Hamilton Masakadza was named the Man of the Match and the Man of the Tournament.
After the tournament, Steven Price wrote on Cricinfo from Harare that the poor standards of cricket had blighted Zimbabwe's Twenty20 domestic competition. 
2008–09 season.
After two disappointing Logan Cup and Faithwear campaigns, Westerns came to life in the Metropolitan Bank Twenty20 tournament for 2008–09. This season all of the matches were played in Bulawayo, split between Queens Sports Club and Bulawayo Athletic Club. The home ground advantage worked in Westerns favour – they won the title in a gripping four run win over Northerns in the final.
Mark Vermeulen was the player of the tournament, and playing in all seven matches he was comfortably the leading run scorer. His 108 for Westerns against Centrals was the highest of the series. Elton Chigumbura, the Northerns captain, was the only other century maker, his average boosting 103 not out also came against Centrals.
The big name bowlers didn't make an impact in this tournament. The biggest name of all – Ray Price – did not play a single match. The domesitc fast bowlers were the most successful, with Trevor Garwe leading the way with 13 wickets at 9.15. Njabulo Ncube and Michael Chinouya took 10 wickets each. For economy rate, leg spinner Graeme Cremer was in a league of his own. His 6 wickets came at 21.16, but he conceded just 4.53 runs per over. Nobody else conceded under 5 an over, Prosper Utseya was the second most economical with an average of 5.52 runs coming from his overs.
It was widely agreed that Bulawayo did a fine job hosting the tournament. The crowd came alive and ran onto the field when Westerns completed their victory in the final. As a result of this and ZC's plan to take cricket to other parts of the country, Bulawayo was named host for the entire Bangladesh tour of Zimbabwe in August 2009.
Northerns and Westerns won through to the final of Zimbabwe's domestic Twenty20 competition. The two teams only won three of their six matches but finished well clear of third-placed Centrals; Easterns, who only last week won the Logan Cup, finished bottom of the pile.
Westerns, who finished bottom in the Logan Cup without a win, had Mark Vermeulen to thank for their reversal of fortune. Returning after a troubled few years when it seemed he would never play at a representative level again, he was by a long margin the leading run-scorer, with 289 runs at 48.16.
He also scored one of only two hundreds – 108 in a remarkable tied game against Centrals – with the other coming from Northerns' Elton Chigumbura.
In the final, Western's victory was largely possible due to the efforts of spinner Mbekezeli Mabuza who took enthralling figures of 5/14. After Westerns had been bowled out for 116 mostly by Trevor Garwe (who was also the leading wicket-taker in this tournament) who took 4–23, Mbekezeli, along with Njabulo Ncube (who provided the key strike) dismantled the Northerns batting line-up to bring victory to their team by four runs. The cricket-starved Bulawayo fans, who had cheered Westerns the whole afternoon, ran onto the field to congratulate their players. Westerns walked away with a trophy and $1000 in cash. Vermeulen, who scored a century and a half century picked up the tournament's best batsman award and got another accolade for the most sixes – 15. Garwe and Mpofu shared the best bowler award.
2009–10 season.
The tournament was renamed as the Stanbic Bank 20 Series. Stanbic Bank (Uganda) Limited was the new sponsors. This was after the reorganization of Zimbabwean cricket and as a result, new franchises started taking part in the competition. They are Mashonaland Eagles (formerly Northerns), Southern Rocks (formerly Southerns), Mountaineers (formerly Easterns), Matabeleland Tuskers (formerly Westerns), and Mid West Rhinos (formerly Centrals). In addition, the Desert Vipers also participated as a sixth team. Craig Williams captained the side.
Mountaineers was easily the strongest team in the tournament final, but they were quite shaky in the group stage. Among the 5 matches they played, they won 3 and lost 2. Stronger than them was Mashonaland Eagles, who had finished first in the pool. Particularly effective against them was Eagle's bowler Ray Price who downed them by 82 runs at Harare taking remarkable figures of 5/12 in just 17 deliveries finishing off the game by the stumping of Natsai Mushangwe.
Mountaineers, however, brought their "A" game to the final. They put their disaster of the previous morning by beating their heavily favored opponents by a massive nine wickets. After bowling out their vaunted opponents for just 105 with Greg Smith taking 3/11 and Prosper Utseya 3/24, they cruised to the target as renowned internationals and former schoolmates Hamilton Masakadza (64*) and Tatenda Taibu (37*) took their team to the inaugural Stanbic Bank 20 Series title.
Despite all this, perhaps the most mind-blowing was Desert Vipers's performance. Coming into the tournament from the minnow cricketing nation of Namibia, nobody had much expectations on Namibia. However, they exceeded all expectations to finish third first in the group stage, then defeating the much more vaunted Matabeleland Tuskers (who won the tournament just a season back in 2008–09 as Westerns) by 31 runs. After the Vipers were restricted to 126/7 (despite Raymond van Schoor scoring 46), with Christopher Mpofu taking 2/26, Tuskers were bowled out for 91 (Tawanda Mupariwa's 31 proved to be the highest score of the innings), with Louis Klazinga taking 2/13 and Dirk Viljoen 2/14.
There was also another record set during the final. The final at Harare Sports Club between the Mountaineers and Eagles attracted an audience of 7500, which is the biggest attendance ever for a domestic match in living memory. As a result, Zimbabwe Cricket officially expressed its delight at the record turn-outs.
A number of former players and overseas players were contracted by the franchises specifically for the tournament. Anthony Ireland and Ian Harvey appeared for the Southern Rocks, Dougie Marillier for Mash Eagles, Andy Blignaut for Matabeleland Tuskers, Greg Smith for the Mountaineers and Darren Stevens and Ollie Rayner for Kwekwe’s MidWest Rhinos. So successful was this edition that a second edition was staged in November that same year.
2010–11 season.
The tournament was staged in November 2010 following the success of the previous tournament in February. This edition of the tournament started with a bang. In a bid to win the tournament, Southern Rocks signed both former West Indian legend Brian Lara (who holds the record for the highest ever Test cricket score of 400*), and a former English deadly fast bowler named Ryan Sidebottom. This not only raised the standard of cricket played in the tournament, but increased its profile to the rest of the cricketing world. A number of other players were also attracted in the tournament, for example, Netherlands and Essex all-rounder Ryan ten Doeschate, Nick Compton, Liam Dawson, Andrew Hall, Paul Horton, and Lou Vincent. Grant Flower also made his comeback to playing competitive matches in Zimbabwe, as captain of Mashonaland Eagles.
Lara's presence was immense, and he scored a half-century on his Twenty20 debut, top-scoring with 65 for the Rocks and then scored a further 34 runs from 2 innings before he left, citing "commitments elsewhere". The Rocks eventually finished third due to brilliant performances by their young opener Sikandar Raza, who was turning into a T20 specialist. Eventual champions Mashonaland Eagles was the strongest by finishing at the top of the pool. The previous year's champions, Mountaineers finished bottom of the lot, thus getting out of contention for the title.
In the 1st Semi-Final, eventual champions Eagles held their nerves to secure a place in the Stanbic Bank 20 Final. After bowling out opponents Matabeleland Tuskers for 70, they themselves were in a position of being bowled out for lower than that, as the last-wicket pair of Ray Price and Douglas Hondo coming in with six still required, and hit the winning runs. The Eagles bowlers had done their job by skittling Tuskers for 70, but it soon became clear the chase wasn't going to be easy. Keegan Meth and Chris Mpofu took two wickets apiece as the Eagles fell to 11 for 4 in the fifth over and between them their eight overs cost 18 runs. Ryan ten Doeschate held the innings together with 26 off 47 balls – more 50-over than 20-over pace – but when he fell 13 and Greg Lamb followed for a duck it was a nerve-jangling conclusion. In the other semi-final, Lou Vincent and Vusi Sibanda combined in a commanding partnership of 139 in 16 overs to guide Mid West Rhinos into the final with an eight-wicket victory against Southern Rocks. The third-wicket pair ensured the early loss of both openers didn't become a major problem as they knocked off the 152-run target with ease. Sibanda cracked five sixes in his 60 while Vincent cleared the ropes twice as he hit an unbeaten 75 off 55 balls. Tatenda Taibu, the Rocks captain, enabled his team to post a decent total with a controlled 57 as the rest of the top order failed to shine. Wickets fell steadily with Brendan Taylor's part-time offspin proving particularly effective as he claimed 2 for 17 in four overs. Steve Tikolo provided some late impetus with a brisk 27, but in the end the total wasn't anywhere near being a challenge.
In the third-place playoff, the Tuskers defeated the Rocks by a massive nine-wickets with Charles Coventry leading the way with 67* off 40 balls, and shared a 126-run partnership with Paul Horton who scored a half-century (56*) of his own. Victory was achieved with 10 balls spare.
In the final between Mash Eagles and Mid West Rhinos, Eagles sneaked through a thrilling contest by 1 run to become the second Stanbic Bank 20 Series Champion. Captain Grant Flower although he did not contribute to the runs as he was on the non-strikers end when the 20 overs were completed, on 0 not out, he led his team admirably to the field. Andrew Hall showed his all-round value with a 17-ball 39, which brought about the total. When Lou Vincent and captain Vusi Sibanda was in control of the Rhinos's run-chase and the result seemingly sealed, the experienced Flower who had long county stints with Essex County Cricket Club brought his spinners, Greg Lamb and Ray Price, and that brought about immediate results. Rhinos collapsed into a 1-run defeat. A quality crowd had come to see the match, and they had got exhilarating cricket.
And an unforgettable finish was made in an already memorable tournament when after the innings break in the final, Grant Flower was taken in a guard of honor as he left the field. As Flower later recalled it was a great way to finish off his career, and it had been a great tournament, with a great standard of cricket.
2011-12 season.
Zimbabwe Cricket was bullish ahead of the tournament, saying that it will face minimal monetary losses in the hosting of its popular Twenty20 tournament which starts on Friday, ZC managing director Ozias Bvute has said. The 10-day event features five franchises and 16 foreign players, and has been the highlight of the domestic calendar since its inception three seasons ago. It is also a sign of the growing financial viability of cricket in Zimbabwe after a period of instability. "We will be very close to breaking even this year and we are not too far from making it a sustainable and profitable tournament," Bvute told ESPNCricnfo. 
This tournament again was memorable, with high-quality cricket being played and the eventual crowning of Mountaineers as the new champions. With 2 titles, Mountaineers became the most successful team in the history of the competition. International stars Ryan ten Doeschate, Lou Vincent, Paul Horton, Liam Dawson and Andrew Hall retained from the previous season. Perhaps the highlights of the domestic cricketing season was the signing of international stars Chris Gayle (Matabeleland Tuskers), Dirk Nannes (Mountaineers), and Australian thunderbolt Shaun Tait (Mid West Rhinos). Players like Peter Trego, Rory Hamilton-Brown, and Phil Mustard also took part in the tournament. A total of 16 foreign players participated in the tournament.
The tournament kicked off on 25 November 2011 and saw both Njabulo Ncube and Natsai Mushangwe star as Mountaineers and Matabeleland Tuskers defeated Mid West Rhinos and Mashonaland Eagles respectively.
At the halfway stage, it seemed that Tuskers were the most dominant team and their strong side consisting of class international players unbalancing the tournament. However, the tournament once again came back to life when despite Chris Gayle scoring a rapid-fire century for Matabeleland Tuskers, but ironically ended up on the losing side. Mid West Rhinos built on innings by Brendan Taylor's unbeaten 75 as they won by seven wickets. Southern Rocks had a forgettable tournament, finishing bottom of the pool, and thus not proceeding to the next stage. What even remarkable was Mashonaland Eagles comeback. They lost all their initial matches but scraping through to the playoff final by defeating Mid West Rhinos by 53 runs, against Matabeleland Tuskers. There they defeated the Tuskers by 23 runs (Duckworth–Lewis method) despite Chris Gayle's blistering half-century, and another blazing one by Steven Trenchard, as they already had compiled a massive 207/7 thanks almost entirely to Ryan ten Doeschate's 121* of 58.
Matabeleland was sent into the playoff final after they were earlier inflicted a defeat by eventual champions Mountaineers at the 1st Semi. That was mostly made possible by captain Hamilton Masakadza's 80*.
In the tournament final, the bowlers led Mountaineers to a remarkable victory. Eagles restricted them to 142/6 (Phil Mustard 56), it seemed that Eagles would win the game (considering that they scored 207 in their playoff final match against the Tuskers), but Shingirai Masakadza took 3/21 in a remarkable spell to see out the Eagles for just 115 and secure victory by 27 runs. He got good support from former captain Prosper Utseya, former New Zealand all-rounder Chris Harris, and international star Dirk Nannes. This was a much-deserved victory considered the quality of cricket played by Mountaineers throughout the tournament.
2012-13 season.
For the 2012-13 season, ZC has announced that in addition to the five local franchises, an additional four school teams will take part, which will add to the rivalry and competition.

Cry break

A cry break is a vocal break in a tone or note in a song. It is characteristic in the singing tone of Hank Williams where a note seems to break and start over again. There are notes that the singer sounds near to the point of starting to cry. It is a technique that is used in country singing. Songs that deal with the issues of sorrow and loss are likely to contain cry breaks. Train whistles may also be played in this manner evoking the same emotions.

Madí

Madí (or MADI) is an international abstract art movement initiated in Buenos Aires in 1946 by the Hungarian-Argentinian artist and poet Gyula Kosice, and the Uruguayans Carmelo Arden Quin and Rhod Rothfuss.
Concrete art.
The movement encompasses all branches of art (the plastic and pictorial arts, music, literature, theater, architecture, dance, etc.) and promotes concrete art (i.e., non-representational geometric abstraction). The artists in the Madí movement typically focus on the concrete, physical reality of the medium and play with the traditional conventions of Western art (for instance, by creating works on irregularly-shaped canvases). Representatives of the movement, in addition to Kosice, Quin and Rothfuss, are Martín Blaszko, Waldo Longo, Juan Bay, Esteban Eitler, Diyi Laañ, Valdo Wellington, among others.
Origin of the name.
Gyula Kosice has explained that the name for the movement is derived from the Republican motto in the Spanish Civil War, ""Madrí, Madrí, no pasarán"" ("Madrid, Madrid, they will not make it in", i.e., the Francoist forces will not invade Madrid). The name is most typically understood as an acronym for "Movimiento, Abstracción, Dimensión, Inveción" (Movement, Abstraction, Dimension, Invention).
Characteristics.
A MADI work is non-figurative; it has a cut-out or irregularly-shaped form; its colors are flat and sharply defined; it is often three-dimensional and sometimes articulated and/or mechanical; and it is playful in spirit. MADI is perhaps the sole remaining art movement which can boast of a half-century of uninterrupted activity since its creation in Buenos Aires in 1946. Today, the MADI movement has over 60 members — painters, sculptors, architects and poets — working in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Japan, Argentina and the United States. The man behind this fifty years of artistic creation is Carmelo Arden Quin.
Why MADI?
To the question, "Why MADI?" Josee Lapeyrere, who met Arden Quin in 1962 and has since participated with her poem-objects in most of the events organized by the movement, replies: "MADI's goal is to be rigorous, inventive, gay and ludic." 
By the importance to which they accord spiritual and Imaginative games, even the most serious MADI artists can be described as playful. Already in 1795, Schiller focused on "the inborn playful nature of man" as an explanation for his production of art forms. In his remarkable essay, "Homo Ludens" ("Ludic Man") (1938), Johan Huizinga observed that, "Play reveals an aspiration to beauty. The terms we use to designate the elements of play are, for the most part, the same as those utilized in the aesthetic realm: beauty, tension, balancing, equilibrium, gradation, contrast, etc. Like art, play engages and delivers. It absorbs. It captivates, or, in other words, it charms. It is full of those two supremely noble qualities which man expresses through rhythm and harmony." The French art critic Dominique Jacquemin also remarks that, "It is possible that Arden Quin's passion for game playing led him to create MADI, the only remaining contemporary art movement which can pride itself in possessing both coherence and a truly international outlook."

Papyrus 24

Papyrus 24 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by siglum 𝔓24, is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Book of Revelation, it contains only Revelation 5:5-8; 6:5-8. The manuscript paleographically has been assigned to the early 4th century. 
Description.
Originally it was written on a large leaf (approximately 19 by 28 cm).
It is the earliest manuscript which has survived to the present day with the text of Rev. 5-6. It uses letter Ζ for επτα ("seven").
The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type (rather proto-Alexandrian). Aland placed it in Category I. This manuscript exhibits textual agreement with Papyrus 18, Papyrus 47, and Codex Sinaiticus, but the surviving fragment is too small to determine its overall textual affinities. 
It is currently housed at the Franklin Trask Library Andover Newton Theological School (OP 1230) in Newton, Massachusetts.

<doc id="19908899" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19908899" title="Red Main">
Red Main

The Red Main () is a river in southern Germany. It is the southern, left headstream of the River Main. It rises in the hills of Franconian Switzerland, near Haag and flows generally northwest through the towns Creußen, Bayreuth, Heinersreuth and Neudrossenfeld. It merges with the White Main near Kulmbach to form the Main. The Red Main is long and descends a total of .
The waters of the Red Main flow through a region of clayey soils, which is why the river carries a lot of suspended solids, especially after rainfall, and acquires a red-brown colour. Hence the name "Red" Main.
Source.
The Red Main rises south of Bayreuth near Hörlasreuth (Creußen) in the Lindenhardt Forest at a height of . The source of the Red Main ("Rotmainquelle") was impounded in stone in 1907, the water flows out of a small wooden pipe. Its source region lies in the Franconian Switzerland-Veldenstein Forest Nature Park. Geologically it belongs to the Brown Jura.
Course.
The Red Main flows initially in a southeasterly direction, before it swings northeast and passes through Creußen. From there it heads almost due north and then turns west beyond Eremitage. It passes through the town of Bayreuth from east to west. In the town centre it has been confined since the 1970s in a concrete channel and partially covered. 
In the vicinity of the Bayreuth folk festival square the river divides into two branches. The southern branch is called the "Mühlkanal", because it used to feed several mills within the town. Its water flow is held roughly constant by a weir and it runs above ground as far as the "Münzgasse". Behind the former state central bank it disappears into a tunnel and surfaces again opposite the Graser School just before reuniting with the northern branch. In the late 1990s a section of the channel in "Opernstraße" was exposed and swept up as part of the rebuilding at the southern end of "Luitpoldplatz".
The northern arm usually carries only a small amount of water, but acts as a flood channel at times of high water and has a very wide river bed. It is partly covered by two car parks.
Beyond Bayreuth the Red Main flows northwest in wide meanders through a broad valley, past the villages of Heinersreuth and Neudrossenfeld. South of Kulmbach, near Steinenhausen Castle, it is united with the White Main, which rises in the Fichtelgebirge mountains near Bischofsgrün. The Red Main is long (source to mouth), the White Main . At the confluence of the two headstreams a bridge was built in 2009 where the young Main may be crossed right at its beginning. Information boards on the bridge describe the rest of the river's course, the local walking and cycle routes and the surrounding countryside.
Bodenmühlwand geotope.
In the vicinity of the Bodenmühle mill east of Bayreuth the Red Main has carved out a bluff ("Prallhang") on a bend in the river caused by erosion, the so-called "Bodenmühlwand", a steep slope in height.
This has exposed rock strata from the Middle Keuper period. Around 225 million years ago the area was a coastal region with frequent changes caused in the influence of land and sea. As a result, today, layers of claystone and Benker sandstone ("Estheria") lie on top of each other. In the latter, geologists found fossils of ostracods ("Palaesteria minuta"), after which the layers are named (in German), the remains of coelacanth as well as the scales, teeth and fin spines of prehistoric sharks.
The highest and thickest rock layer belongs to reed sandstones ("Stuttgart-Formation") of the Carnian stage.
Fauna.
The Red Main is a habitat for brown trout, grayling, barbel, bullhead, lamprey, carp, tench, carp bream, roach, perch, pike, pike-perch, eel and burbot.
Trails.
The Red Main Trail ("Rotmainweg"'), which was laid out by Fichtelgebirge Club, begins near the source. This main footpath is marked by a red M on a white background throughout its length. Its 60 kilometre long route is as follows: Sourche of the Red Main-Creußen-Eimersmühle-Schlehenberg-Eremitage-Bayreuth-Martinsreuth-Altenplos-Grüngraben-Jöslein-Langenstadt-Affalterhof Katschenreuth-Steinenhausen Castle near Kulmbach (confluence with the White Main).
The Main-Mies Trail ("Main-Mies-Weg"), established by the Upper Palatinate Forest Club ("Oberpfälzer-Wald-Verein") also begins near the source. Here the trail is marked by at red diagonal cross on a white background. The 93 km long route is as follows: Source of the Red Main-Creußen-Seidwitz-Frankenberg-Neustadt am Kulm-Erbendorf-Falkenberg-Tirschenreuth-Griesbach.

<doc id="19908907" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19908907" title="St Nicolas Church, Portslade">
St Nicolas Church, Portslade

St Nicolas Church is an Anglican church in the Portslade area of the English city of Brighton and Hove. It has 12th-century origins, and serves the old village of Portslade, inland from the mostly 19th-century Portslade-by-Sea area.
History.
A Roman road ran from north to south through the area which later became Portslade. There was no recorded Roman settlement, although Samian ware pottery has been found nearby and neighbouring Southwick had a Roman villa. A village began to develop in mediaeval times, and a manor house and church were built close to each other in the 12th century. As originally built, the church consisted of a chancel, a nave with an aisle on the south side, and a square tower at the west end. The nave, aisle and part of the tower appear to have been built first, along with the typically Norman architectural feature of twin pillars of Caen stone; the chancel and the upper part of the tower were built in the early 13th century. The bell tower, with battlements, was added at the top of the tower in the 14th century; the porch on the south side was added later, but probably by the 16th century.
Portslade was originally the most populous and important of the villages and parishes west of Brighton, and St Nicolas Church never declined to a ruined state, unlike the churches at Hove (St Andrew's), Aldrington (St Leonard's), Hangleton (St Helen's) or West Blatchington (St Peter's). However, the fabric of the church and its fixtures did decay gradually over time, and like many churches in Brighton and Hove it was altered and restored during the Victorian era. Medieval wall paintings were uncovered in the nave in 1847, but were whitewashed over and lost. The mural depicted the Last Judgement; an illustrated article was subsequently written by the incumbent vicar for an archaeological journal, in which a date of 1440 was attributed to the painting. An aisle was added on the north side in 1849. In 1946, local stained glass designers Cox & Barnard made a small window which was installed in the church tower. It commemorates former verger A.C. Wheatland and depicts the church's patron saint.
The church roof was made of heavy stone slabs, and significant repair work had to be carried out in 1959: it was not only sagging in places, but had been displaced by because of their weight—despite the support given by substantial wooden king posts. For most of that year, a jack, anchored under the chancel arch, was used to gradually move the roof back into position. At the same time, a vestry and a gallery for the organ were added.
One of Portslade's most prominent families, the Brackenburys, had their family vault at the church, and between 1869 and 1874 the Brackenbury Chapel was built at its west end. Highly elaborate, in contrast to the simple church, it was built by Hannah Brackenbury, who was buried there when she died in 1873. She was a benefactor to local causes and charities, and to Balliol College, Oxford, where a debating society and a building at the college entrance are named after her. She also donated land and money for the construction of the local primary school—a Gothic building of 1872.
Architecture.
The church is a relatively plain, uncomplicated structure, similar in layout to many 12th- and 13th-century churches in Sussex. The chancel, with its chamfered Norman arch, leads to the three-bay nave with aisles on the south and north sides. In the older south aisle, the piers have capitals decorated with a scallop design. The 19th-century north aisle is similar but wider. Also in the chancel are a restored sedilia, piscina (both 13th-century, and on the south wall), pulpit of stone, a modern altar, and a reredos and panelling dating from 1921. Most windows are lancets; some date from the 13th century, and most contain plain glass. Two stained glass windows depict St Francis of Assisi and St Nicolas. The east end windows consist of two tall, narrow lancets below a sexfoil (six-lobed window).
The Brackenbury Chapel is more ornate, featuring a three-pane lancet window with stained glass (including the family's coat of arms), elaborately carved wood, stonework and black and green marble. In the centre is a marble tomb, and the walls—flanked by arcades—feature memorial tablets to family members. The chapel is built of knapped flint, unlike the rest of the church which is pale rubble-work. A partition links the chapel and the north aisle of the church.
The turreted tower, in three parts—the 12th-century base, the 13th-century upper section and the bell tower—is of coursed stone rubble-work, rather than the random arrangement in the main walls of the church. It has no buttresses.
The church today.
The church was listed at Grade II* on 19 July 1950. As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove.
Services are held daily, with two or three on Sundays.
St Andrew's Church was built on Church Road in Portslade-by-Sea between 1863 and 1864. It was designed by Brighton-based architect Edmund Scott. In 1898 it was given its own parish, but this has now been united with the parish of St Nicolas. The combined parish covers the whole of Portslade-by-Sea and Portslade Village, and extends some way on to the south face of the South Downs. As from September 2013 the status of St Andrews was changed to a "Chapel of Ease" and now will be only used occasionally for religious service.
In September 2013, St Nicolas Portslade & St Andrew Portslade were united with The Good Shepherd Mile Oak to form the new Parish of Portslade & Mile Oak.

Oh No Not Stereo

Oh No Not Stereo is a high-energy melodic rock band from Los Angeles, California.
History.
Formation/001.
Oh No Not Stereo was formed by Skyler Nielsen and Mykul Lee in Hollywood, California in June 2003. The two met at a music store in Hollywood within months of moving to LA. Immediately they collaborated musically and began writing together, developing their concept of a live-duo that delivers a full 'conventional' sound. (The band's name relates to Nielsen's inability to hear out of his right ear, suffered from a serious ATV accident in 1993.) In December 2004, the duo recorded with producer Marc Jordan (Velvet Revolver, Rock Kills Kid, A Static Lullaby) and independently released their first full length record "001" on May 10, 2005.
Trio/002.
Oh No Not Stereo toured relentlessly as a duo for eighteen months before meeting Joshley Hogan in Oklahoma City in February 2005. He soon relocated to Los Angeles to join the band playing bass. In October 2005, the three piece re-hired Marc Jordan to record a self-titled EP, which they would release independently in January 2006. Nielsen and Lee continued to tour with Hogan until he left the band in June of that same year. The duo soon then-after signed a distribution deal with Takeover Records in November 2006. They re-packaged, re-mastered and re-released their EP with the label on Feb 20th 2007, this time referring to the EP as "002". The sixth track on the re-release is different than the sixth track self-titled EP; the band decided to replace "Monster" with "Every Link In The Chain", which was engineered by Ken Harter at Wedge Studios in Long Beach. The band filed for breach of contract with Takeover Records shortly afterward due to financial struggles with the label.
Warren Miller Films and MTV Networks regularly license Oh No Not Stereo's music for use in shows such as Bam's Unholy Union, Paris Hilton's My New BFF, and Meet the Barkers. The group was also chosen out of over 4,000 bands to compete in MTV2's Dew Circuit Breakout contest in 2007.
Quartet/003 & 004.
Oh No Not Stereo added Michael Rosenthal on bass and Pat O'Donnell on second guitar before playing SXSW in 2007, Vans Warped Tour dates and touring with Sugarcult that spring and summer. Nielsen and Lee inhabited a house in Scottsdale, Arizona where they wrote over 50 songs together between May and July 2007. They then returned to the studio in October 2007 to self-produce their latest works, "003" and "004", with assisted production from Max Coane (Jack's Mannequin, The Rocket Summer), and Jim Wirt (Incubus, Something Corporate, Jack's Mannequin). After the two-month recording process, Scott Trieglaff was added on bass and Brandon Henderson was added on second guitar for their 'SxSW Tour 2008'. With this line-up, Oh No Not Stereo completed over 25,000 miles of touring across the U.S. between March and June 2008. The band also a completed a co-headlining UK tour with Bayside and Hit The Lights in December 2008 with touring members Jussi Karvinen and Airin Older (Sugarcult). In January 2009 ONNS supported The All-American Rejects in the UK with Jussi Karvinen on guitar and touring bass player Everett Connors. The band was a featured showcasing artist at the South By Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas in March 2009, with Marc Wysocki on bass guitar. 
After the digital release of their latest record ("003") on January 13 (2009) Oh No Not Stereo designed a Limited Edition Bonus EP (released as "004") to be included in the Deluxe Edition of the album for fan club members and online pre-orders. The physical release of the 15-track record was on March 10, stocking the shelves of select Hot Topic and Best Buy stores nationwide. As an effort to reward fans and friends on the mailing list, and shine a light on the dynamic capability of the band, ONNS offered a free download every Monday in October (2009) of exclusive live-acoustic tracks and video footage of "Say Anything", "All You", "This Friday Night", and "Let's Get It Started".
As a result of their successful independently-driven marketing campaign, ONNS spent seven consecutive weeks on the CMJ Top 200 radio charts.
InCaseOfStaresUseFire.
Skyler and Mykul spent most of 2010 writing new material for their fifth release and third full-length, InCaseOfStaresUseFire. Throughout the year the pair accumulated over 50 new songs that they kept track of on a white board in their kitchen. That was the easy part. By the end of the year, as the duo prepared to fly producer Jayson DeZuzio (Foxy Shazam, Coheed and Cambria) out to LA from New Jersey, the great task became how to sift through these tracks and assemble a cohesive album.
In the end, 10 songs were recorded over the course of six weeks in early 2011, both in the band’s home studio and SoundFactory studios in Hollywood (this time adding guitarist Jussi Karvinen in the mix as the third leg to the writing, pre-production and recording process.) The new record, meant to be experienced as a complete album, offers a dynamic range, veering from the propulsive rock of the album opener “Make My Move” to the angular heaviness of “Behind Closed Doors” to the ballad “Brighterside”. There’s a notable thematic variety to the songs as well, but the common thread is that of positivity.
“We take a lot of pride in being independent, which allows us to do whatever we want musically,” Skyler says. “No two songs on this record are about the same thing or same person, yet each song was written in confidence that the listener will be able to relate.”
Additionally, the band spent 16 weeks this summer conceptualizing and filming a music video for every song on the album. The intention: To infuse the record with additional life and offer visual experiences that parallel the meanings of the tracks. As an added bonus, the video for "All You" was licensed for MTV’s current reboot of Beavis and Butthead.

Roanoke Region

The Roanoke Region is the area of the Commonwealth of Virginia surrounding the city of Roanoke. Its usage may refer to the metropolitan statistical area or the Roanoke Valley, but it sometimes includes areas in the Allegheny Mountains and New River Valley which includes Alleghany county, Montgomery county, Covington, Clifton Forge, Blacksburg, Christiansburg, and Radford. Rarely, it may include Bedford County and Floyd County.
The Roanoke Region, excluding communities in the New River Valley, has a population of 316,802. If including the New River Valley, its population is 475,130.
Both the Roanoke Region and the Roanoke MSA are sometimes referred to as the Roanoke Valley (or Greater Roanoke Valley) and are often included in the NewVa region. The Roanoke Valley, however, more accurately describes the geographic depression between the Blue Ridge Mountains where many of the region's communities are located (see Roanoke Valley). Notable places and landmarks in the Roanoke Region include the Blue Ridge Parkway, the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Allegheny Mountains, the Roanoke River, Virginia Tech, the Mill Mountain Star, the Booker T. Washington monument, the Fincastle Court House, and Smith Mountain Lake.
Definitions and regional organizations.
Roanoke Metropolitan Statistical Area.
As defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Roanoke MSA includes four counties, two independent cities, and 18 incorporated towns. Roanoke is the principal city and the entire MSA had an estimated population of 298,108 in 2008.
Roanoke Region.
The Roanoke Region is defined by many regional economic, planning, and tourism organizations. The most common definition includes communities located within the Roanoke Valley and Allegheny Mountains. It typically includes
The Roanoke Regional Partnership, a regional, nonprofit economic development organization formed by area businesses and local governments, defines the region as including the counties of Roanoke, Botetourt, Franklin, and Alleghany; the cities of Roanoke, Salem, and Covington; and the town of Vinton. The same region is defined by the Commonwealth of Virginia as the Workforce Investment Area III, but also includes Craig County. The LWIA-III service area is also served by the Roanoke Valley-Alleghany Regional Commission, an organization that provides analysis, demographic research, and other regional data for the state and local governments.
The Roanoke Valley Convention and Visitors Bureau (RCVB), which promotes tourism in the region and provides conference and meeting services for business and visitors, excludes Alleghany County from its definition, but includes Bedford, Montgomery, and Floyd counties, although it gives less attention to these areas in its promotional materials. The Roanoke Regional Chamber of Commerce (RRCC) advocates and provides various professional services to businesses within the region, which it more strictly defines as Botetourt, Craig, Franklin, and Roanoke counties, and Roanoke and Salem cities.
Various media outlets, periodicals, and magazines in the region include different areas in their coverage. The most widely distributed and read newspaper, "The Roanoke Times", includes Bedford, Botetourt, Floyd, Franklin, Giles, Montgomery, and Roanoke counties, Bedford, Radford, Roanoke, and Salem cities in its coverage area. Other periodicals, magazines, and television news outlets include the same communities, but also the city of Lynchburg, Amerherst county, and Rockbridge county.
Thus, the Roanoke Region typically refers to the following communities:
And, less often, also includes:
NewVa region.
The use of the term "NewVa" is relatively new and was first introduced in 2002 by the Roanoke Valley-Alleghany Regional Commission as a brand for an economic development strategy serving the a larger economic region that combines two adjacent planning districts: the 5th Planning District and the 4th Planning District. It has since been adopted by the majority of economic and community development organizations and businesses as well as participating local governments.
The NewVa Corridor Technology Council (NCTC), a nonprofit, member-driven association of businesses and organizations in the region, is most prominent contributor to promoting the NewVa regional identity. The NewVa economic strategy and the NCTC define the region as nine counties, five cities, and 22 towns.
Economy and major industries.
The Roanoke Region has a diverse economic base that includes finance, service, retail, transportation, manufacturing, health care and life sciences. Alongside Montgomery County, the region is also a major technology and research hub, home to Virginia Tech and several technology companies. The region serves as the medical, cultural, retail, media, and commercial center for nearly a million people, and is the largest place for employment opportunities in western Virginia.
Finance, insurance, and real estate.
Several banks and insurance providers are headquartered (or regionally headquartered) in the region, including:
The region is also home to top ranked Virginia Tech's Pamplin College of Business and Radford University College of Business and Economics.
Transportation.
The first major industry in the region was the railroad industry. The transportation and transportation-related manufacturing industries have since grown and include:
Health care and life sciences.
The health care and life science industries are anchored by the Carilion Clinic, one of the largest health care companies in Virginia and the region's largest employer, and Virginia Tech, both of which recently partnered to establish the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine. Also, Carilion Clinic, Virginia Tech, and the University of Virginia have collaborated in establishing the Carilion Biomedical Institute. Other major health care related firms include:
Geography and climate.
The Roanoke Region covers approximately of land, and approximately . of water. The region is located within the Appalachian Mountains, specifically the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains. There are also two major rivers, the James River and the Roanoke (Staunton) River, that pass through the Roanoke Region. There are several small lakes, including Lake Moomaw and Carvin's Cove, as well as one major lake, Smith Mountain Lake. The region is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forest biome. Smith Mountain Lake, the Blue Ridge Parkway, the Appalachian Trail, the rivers and streams, Dixie Caverns, the Botetourt County blueways, and the mountains attract thousands of visitors to the region each year.
The climate of the Roanoke Region is humid subtropical with four distinct seasons. The average temperature in January is ; July is 75.6 degrees. The average yearly rainfall is and snowfall is 27.2 inches.
History.
Early history.
The earliest history of the Roanoke Region exists as archaeological evidence of Native American tribes which settled by the Roanoke River, which takes its name from the Algonquian word for the shell "money" found in the waters.
In the mid-1770s, Scotch-Irish and German settlers reached the upper Roanoke Valley traveling on the Great Wagon Road down the Shenandoah Valley from Pennsylvania. Settlers also followed the James River from eastern Virginia. As tradesmen and farmers moved into the region, new counties and communities were established.
Botetourt County was established in 1770, carved out from Augusta County. The county was named for the popular governor of the Virginia Colony, Lord Botetourt. The county's boundaries extended west all the way to the Mississippi River including most of Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The town of Fincastle in Botetourt served as the gateway to the American West and was the starting point for Lewis and Clark's famous exploration of the Louisiana Purchase. Botetourt's early role is preserved in the Fincastle Courthouse, designed by Thomas Jefferson.
Formed from parts of Bedford and Henry County and named for Benjamin Franklin, Franklin County was established in 1785. It produced one of the nation's most respected leaders, eminent black educator Booker T. Washington, who was born April 5, 1856, on the Burroughs Plantation, approximately sixteen miles northeast of Rocky Mount. His childhood was spent as a slave, and he lived in a one-room cabin. After emancipation and a successful quest to educate himself, Washington established a new black school in 1881 in Tuskegee, Alabama. Known as the Tuskegee Institute, the college helped Washington achieve his goal of educating his people to provide opportunities. His birthplace is preserved today as the Booker T. Washington National Monument.
Alleghany County was formed out of Botetourt in 1822 and named for the Allegheny Mountains. During the Civil War, the county provided much-needed iron resources for the Confederate troops; Longdale Furnace provided the iron for the .
Roanoke County was formed from Botetourt in 1838, taking its name from the Roanoke River. The county eventually annexed additional territory in 1845 from Montgomery County, and historic Salem continues to serve as the county seat. The town of Salem, established in 1802, served travelers on the Great Wagon Road and was located on two stagecoach lines. It was the major center of activity in the Roanoke area until the mid-1880s. In 1847, the Virginia Institute, a boy's preparatory school, moved to Salem from Staunton and was renamed Roanoke College. Salem became an independent city in 1968.
Towns formed within what is now the City of Roanoke in the first decades of the 19th century. Antwerp was subdivided in 1801, followed by Gainesborough in 1825 (the present Gainsboro neighborhood) and Old Lick in 1834. The Gainesborough settlement remained the most populous community until 1874 when the town of Big Lick was chartered. The unique name was derived from salt marshes that attracted wildlife to the area. This tiny village of less than five hundred people was to become the town of Roanoke in 1882 and in 1884, the city of Roanoke. The new town was located along the old Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad, later to become the Norfolk and Western Railway.
The history of transportation.
With the Great Wilderness Road and Botetourt County serving as the gateway to the American West, the Roanoke Region was always an intersection for travel and transportation. In the 1850s, the region became a major hub for the nation's developing railroad system. The Virginia and Tennessee Railroad (V&T) came to Big Lick, linking Lynchburg to Bristol and transforming the region. A system was developed to link three railroads across the southern tier of Virginia to form the Atlantic, Mississippi & Ohio Railroad (AM&O). When the Shenandoah Valley Railroad linked Hagerstown, Maryland to the AM&O in Roanoke in 1882, it became the Norfolk & Western Railway. This marked the beginning of a period of rapid growth for the City of Roanoke which was called "the magic city" during this time. The Town of Vinton also was incorporated at this time.
To further enhance Roanoke's reputation as a rail hub, The Virginian Railway was built in the early 20th century along the Roanoke River and merged with Norfolk & Western in 1959.
In Alleghany County, the Virginia Central Railroad had extended its track from Staunton to the Jackson River in 1857. After the Civil War, the railroad expanded west to connect with the Covington and Ohio Railroad and in 1868 the two lines merged to form the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O). The railroad established a depot and named it Clifton Forge, the only town in the United States to bear its name. When the track to Richmond was completed in 1881, the town boomed as a railway hub and remains as the region's only stop on the Amtrak line.
Access to the coalfields of Southwest Virginia made N&W prosperous, transporting the world-famous Pocahontas bituminous coal which fueled half the world's navies. N&W became famous for manufacturing steam locomotives in the Roanoke Shops.
C&O Railway was eventually obtained by CSX Transportation, merging the railways of Clifton Forge with the larger system that exists today.
Interstate highways also have made a significant impact on the region. Interstate 81 runs from Canada to Tennessee paralleling the Alleghany Mountains in Virginia. Interstate 64 runs from Chesapeake, Virginia to St. Louis, Missouri. An excellent transportation infrastructure has been a hallmark of the Roanoke Region for more than 150 years.
Present.
In Franklin County, a 1960s era project to build the hydroelectric Smith Mountain Dam created the largest lake in Virginia, Smith Mountain Lake, which is an economic powerhouse for the region. The lake's and of shoreline are dotted with luxury homes and condominiums. It is popular for recreation and recognized for boating, skiing, and fishing. Bassmasters tournaments are televised nationally from the lake.
The region combines a host of well-known nature-based attractions such as the Appalachian Trail, Blue Ridge Parkway, and Jackson and James Rivers with a growing and sophisticated business community.
Culture.
The Roanoke Region has a diverse culture. There are a number of music and performing arts venues and groups, a prospering arts community and lively nightlife, and a unique set of outdoor opportunities.
Arts, theater and music.
The region boasts a thriving arts community with more than 40 art galleries throughout the area. The Taubman Museum of Art in downtown Roanoke City is a work of modern architecture. The museum that recently hosted Cirque du Soleil and features numerous exhibits. The colleges in the region all each maintain museums and galleries, capturing the work of students, faculty, and regional, national, and international artists. The communities in the region each have art festivals and shows.
The Roanoke Region is home to professional live theater. The Mill Mountain Theatre offers several shows a year including classics and originals. The Roanoke Civic Center also regularly features traveling Broadway shows and a variety of other famous plays. Community theater and college theater are also prevalent in the region.
The region has a long history in music and is a featured stop along Virginia's Heritage Music Trail, also known as the Crooked Road. There are several venues throughout the region that host nationally and internationally recognized music acts, including the Roanoke Civic Center, the Jefferson Center, the Salem Civic Center, Roanoke College Gymnasium, and Lane Stadium at Virginia Tech. Smaller venues also host traveling music acts as well as the growing local music scene.
Education.
There are 11 institutes of higher education in the Roanoke Region, including several colleges within Virginia Tech.
Colleges and Universities include:
The Roanoke Higher Education Center, located in downtown Roanoke, is the satellite campus for a number of Virginia state universities and colleges.

List of Presidents of the United States

Under the United States Constitution, the President of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States. As chief of the executive branch and head of the federal government as a whole, the presidency is the highest political office in the United States by influence and recognition. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The president is indirectly elected to a four-year term by an Electoral College (or by the House of Representatives should the Electoral College fail to award an absolute majority of votes to any person). Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected President more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once. Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President assumes the office. The President must be at least 35 years of age, has to live in the United States for 14 years, and has to be a "natural born" citizen of the United States.
This list includes only those persons who were sworn into office as president following the ratification of the United States Constitution, which took effect on March 4, 1789. For American leaders before this ratification, see President of the Continental Congress. The list does not include any Acting Presidents under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
There have been 43 people sworn into office, and 44 presidencies, as Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and 24th president. Of the individuals elected as president, four died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy) and one resigned (Richard Nixon).
George Washington, the first president, was inaugurated in 1789 after a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. William Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office with 32 days in 1841. Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest with over twelve years, but died shortly into his fourth term in 1945; he is the only president to have served more than two terms. A constitutional amendment, affecting presidents after Harry Truman, was passed to limit the number of times an individual can be elected president. Andrew Jackson, the seventh president, was the first to be elected by men of all classes in 1828 after most laws barring non-land-owners from voting were repealed. Warren Harding was the first elected after women gained voting rights in 1920. Four presidents – John Q. Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin Harrison and George W. Bush – lost the popular vote but assumed office. John F. Kennedy has been the only president of Roman Catholic faith, and the current president, Barack Obama, is the first president of recent African descent.
The listing below is complete for the current government of the USA. For this country, however, there were prior governments (including that under the Articles of Confederation). Prior to George Washington as first president under the current constitution, there were twelve people in leadership over the government of the United States of America who held the title of "President". Also during the Civil War, there was the position of "President of the Confederate States of America" in an entity separate from the USA, and this position was held by one person.
Living former presidents.
As of , there are four living former presidents:
The most recent death of a former president was that of Gerald Ford (1974–77) on December 26, 2006, aged 93.

Flagfall

Flagfall or flag fall is common Australian expression for a fixed start fee, especially in the haulage and railroad industry. From the Australian mobile phone industry, the expression has recently begun to spread to other English language countries, as business jargon for an initial fixed fee for establishing each phone call. The expression is also beginning to find its way into other businesses as a synonym to "start fee". The taxi expression is also being used in Hong Kong, New Zealand, and some other countries, but hasn't been used there as a general synonym for start fee.
Origin.
The origin is a taxi expression for the minimum charge for hiring a taxi, to which the rate per kilometre or mile and a rate per minute is usually then added up to a minimum taxicab road speed. 
When the passenger steps inside the taxicab, the flagfall condition is triggered and the taxicab driver can start the taximeter. Even if the passenger has not yet instructed the driver where to take them, the driver is entitled to the flagfall and the rate per minute component (even if the taxi is not moving). 
The term, "Flagfall" dates back to the old mechanical taximeters, which were equipped with a flag-like lever that could be seen from outside the cab. When the "flag" was up and visible, the cab was not occupied. When a passenger stepped in, the driver turned the lever down - the "flag fall" - and the taximeter started counting. In Australia, once the taximeter is counting, there are orange tariff indicator lights on the taxi head sign which light up to show the taxicab is hired.

Appelle mon numéro

"Appelle mon numéro" (English: "Call My Number") is a 2008 song recorded by French singer Mylène Farmer. Released on 3 November 2008, it was the second single from her seventh studio album, "Point de Suture". It received generally positive reviews from critics and was more aired on radio and television than Farmer's previous single, "Dégénération". In France, the single allowed Farmer to establish a new record: to obtain a sixth number-one hit.
Background and release.
In late August 2008, when "Point de Suture" was available digitally, several sites announced "Appelle mon numéro" as the singer's next single from her album, but often presented as a probability. However, this information was not officially confirmed before 12 September 2008. That day, a promotional format was sent to the radio stations which began to broadcast the radio edit version. 
On 9 October, "Cede.ch" site announced the date of release – 3 November 2008 – and two formats that would be available – two CD maxi. Two days later, "Amazon.fr" and "Alapage.com" revealed other two formats: a CD single, a digipack CD maxi and a vinyl. The cover art of the CD maxi was shown on 19 October 2008, and those of the CD single on 21 October.
Music and lyrics.
This "pop ballad" uses an acoustic guitar. The psychologist Hugues Royer said the song is naughty and speaks of love on the phone, Farmer hoping that her lover came to share her privacy. He said that the lyrics ""my most beautiful gesture"" is for the singer "the act of placing her head on the pillow, and that this privilege is reserved for the person who ""enters the history"", i.e. that of the singer".
Music video.
On 8 October, some media revealed that the music video was shot on 4 and 5 October in the studios of Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis, France. This video was scheduled to be broadcast on television on 22 October but, according to Polydor, it could be delayed on 29 October if the assembly is not finished. It was directed by Benoît Di Sabatino, the singer's companion, who had also produced the music videos for "C'est une belle journée", "L'amour n'est rien..." and "Drôle de creepie" (for Lisa). The first images were shown on the Internet on 17 October 2008 and the full video was eventually available on the Internet and on television on 22 October. It was elected "Video of the month" of November 2008 on the radio Radio Jeunes Reims. On 17 November 2008, the video was available digitally on the official sites of download.
The video has no screenplay and uses the radio edit version of the song. In it, the singer is lying on a huge white bed, while four way of colors illustrating the four seasons are shown (dead leaves, rain, snow, sun). In each of them, Farmer wears different clothes, and has successively in her hands a crystal ball, a pillow, a telephone, a shoe that she repairs while wearing round glasses, an umbrella. The video ends in the same way it began, i.e. showing the singer being asleep. 
The video was generally well received by the media. "Virgin" site said the clip is "fresh and colorful", and expresses "the naughty and the childhood side of the artist". According to "Obiwi", the video is "sweet and paradisiac" and "we would believe it was taken from a fairy's tale". For "Musique.evous", Farmer seems surprisingly "happy" in this video which "shows the red icon in a new light". However, "Plurielles" said the video, "full of thoughtlessness", was not appreciated by all the singer's fans, adding that it shows Farmer "as a child woman, a little candid". However, the video was diversely appreciated by the singers' fans: some of them liked the freshness, the colors and the fact that Farmer was smiling in the video, others considered that there was a lack of inspiration.
Critical reception.
The song was generally well received by the critics. According to "La Meuse", this song will "win over the public". "Télé Moustique" said that "Appelle mon numéro" is "an stubborning song whose freshness makes almost forget the refrain". For "Cité Gay", the song is "rather pleasant, does not give an irrepressible desire to replay without delay". For "Le Petit Journal", the song is "a solid, tenderly naughty and very catchy composition". "Backchichinfo" stated: ""Appelle mon numéro" holds the attention, with an effective verse and a certain general freshness." According to Royer, the song demonstrates a sense of "indolent humor" and is "musically successful".
However, there were sometimes mixed reviews by the media and Farmer's fans. For example, "Hit Muse Mag" stated: ""Appelle mon numéro" a minimalist text. The detractors of Mylène who had blamed her for an outdated expression and for a pretentious vocabulary are fulfilled... The poor melody is easy to remember. We wonder if, due to having dug the abysses of a black and painful poetry, Mylène Farmer did not use her lexical field preferred up to the rope." "Le Matin" deemed that with this song, "Farmer almost reaches the limits of the easiness : kind melody, simple lyrics". Similarly, French author Julien Rigal said the song has "disappointing lyrics".
Chart performances.
On 8 November 2008, the single entered the French Singles Chart at number one, selling 16,236 units, thus becoming Farmer's sixth number-one single in France, which was at the time the new record for an artist on the SNEP Singles Chart. The following week, it dropped to number three, with 5,376 sales (-66%), and continued to drop, re-gained a few places during Christmas, then dropped slowly out of the top 50. It totaled five weeks in the top ten, 21 weeks in the top 50 and 36 weeks in the top 100. "Appelle mon numéro" also entered the digital chart at number 22 on 8 November 2008, then dropped and fell off the top 50 after eight weeks.
The single started at number 12 on the Ultratop 40 in Belgium (Wallonia), on 15 November 2008, then peaked at number seven seven weeks later, and remained in the top 40 for 14 weeks. In Switzerland, it debuted at number 53 on 16 November 2008, then dropped to number 89 and fell off the chart.
In France, the single was much aired on radio than "Dégénération". It reached number 38 in its fourth week on the airplay chart. The video reached number 13 on the Muzicast television chart in its second week, while the single peaked at number 42 on the club chart in its fifth week, on 4 December 2008. The song was much aired in Ukraine, Lithuania and Russia, reaching number 16 in Moscow and 19 in St. Petersbourg in 2008 and 2009, and hit number 98 in the whole country in 2010.
Promotion and live performances.
The song was actively promoted on TF1: two advertisements, respectively of 20 and 30 seconds, were broadcast from the late October to the early November, then a 1:30 teaser in early December 2008. Mylène Farmer performed the song in lip sync on 13 December 2008, on France 2, on the TV show "Ça ne finira jamais", devoted to Johnny Hallyday. On this occasion, the singer was sitting near a window and was dressed as on the single cover, plus few rings with skulls at her fingers. The song was also performed during the 2009 tour: at this point, Farmer wore a glittering short dress with red cape with hood and the stage became pink. The introduction being very different from the album version, the first notes of the song are unrecognizable.

Charles Ragon de Bange

Charles Ragon de Bange (1833–1914), often simply called de Bange, was a Polytechnician and a French artillery colonel of the 19th century. He invented the first effective obturator system for breech-loading artillery. Its basic principle of functioning is still widely in use to this day. He also designed a system of field guns of various calibers which served the French Army well into World War I: the "Système de Bange".
Career.
De Bange breech obturator system.
Many attempts had been made at developing breech-loading cannons, but had only partial success sealing of the breech. When fired, hot gasses and burning gunpowder could escape, losing power and potentially burning the operating crew. Rifles, with smaller loads and less stress, were able to use rubber or other materials in O-rings, but a suitable system for cannons was not as easy to come by. Several materials were able to hold the pressure and heat of cannon fire, but did not naturally expand like rubber, thereby failing to provide a tight seal.
In 1872, de Bange designed the "De Bange system", a new type of obturator for cannons. His design used a breech block made of three parts; an interrupted screw locking mechanism at the rear, a doughnut-shaped grease-impregnated asbestos pad that sealed the breech, and a rounded movable "nose cone" at the front. When fired, the nose was driven rearward, compressing the asbestos pad, squeezing it so it expanded outward to seal the breech. The French referred to the shape of the breech's nose as "mushroom like", as it resembled the cap of a mushroom.
The action was controlled by a handle, normally mounted vertically on the right side of the breech. When lifted, the handle operated a cam that forced the breech to rotate counter-clockwise, unlocking the interrupted thread. The entire breech was then pulled rearward with the same handle, sliding on a ring-shaped holder. The breech holder was hinged on one side, normally the left, so when the breech block was slid all the way to the rear it could be rotated out of the way for loading.
The de Bange system was widely adopted, including by the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy. The technique developed by de Bange is still in use today.
The only major advance on the original de Bange system was the introduction of the stepped screw in the Welin breech block of 1889, which greatly increased the load-bearing surface of the breech, allowing them to be made shorter, simpler, more secure and faster to operate. Other block mechanisms are also used, but the de Bange obturator remains widespread even on these.
Manufacture of cannons.
In 1873, de Bange became Director of the "Atelier-de-précision" in the Central Depot in Paris (Paris arsenal's precision workshop), in order to redesign French light and heavy artillery.
Between 1877 to 1881, De bange developed several artillery pieces, such as the De Bange 90 mm cannon (field artillery, 1877), the De Bange 80 mm cannon (mountain artillery, 1878), the De Bange 120 mm cannon (siege artillery, 1878), De Bange 155 mm cannon (siege artillery, 1877), as well as mortars for siege warfare, such as the 1880 De Bange 220 mm mortar, and coastal batteries such as the De Bange 240 mm and De Bange 270 mm. Several of these weapons were used during the colonial wars of the end of the 19th century, during the First World War and also sometimes during the Second World War. As with other cannons, the de Bange cannons had the disadvantage of being slow to fire, as they were affected by recoil, and thus had to be re-aimed after every shot. This inconvenience would be solved with the onset of the famous Canon de 75, that had a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism, which kept the gun's trail and wheels perfectly still during the firing sequence.
From 1882 to 1889, de Bange was Director of the Cail Manufacturing Corporation ("Société Anonyme des Anciens Etablissements Cail"), the forerunner of the "Société française de constructions mécaniques", where he worked on weapon design and trade, selling guns to such countries as Serbia.
A street is named after him ("Rue du Colonel de Bange") in the city of Versailles.

Hershey Felder

Hershey Felder (born July 9, 1968) is a Canadian pianist, actor, playwright, composer, producer, and director. He created (as playwright, actor, and pianist) the role of American composer George Gershwin for the theatrical stage in the stage play "George Gershwin Alone". Combining the craft of acting and concert-level piano performance, "George Gershwin Alone" was followed by the creation of the role of Fryderyk Chopin, the Polish composer/pianist, the roles of Ludwig van Beethoven and Gerhard von Breuning in "Beethoven, As I Knew Him", the role of Leonard Bernstein in "The Making of a Maestro: Bernstein", and Franz Liszt in "Rock Star". These works comprise "The Composer Sonata." 
To date, Felder has appeared before the paying public with his Sonata as well as in theatre roles and concerts for more than 4,000 performances. Felder has acknowledged that he will continue his theatrical one-man format with stories reaching further than just the art of classical music, and will also include his own compositions.
As director, Felder premiered award-winning concert pianist Mona Golabek in "The Pianist of Willesden Lane". The acclaimed one-woman show is Felder's adaptation of "The Children of Willesden Lane", written by Golabek and Lee Cohen.
Of Felder’s compositions, "Noah’s Ark, an Opera" has been performed with members of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.

Personal life.
Felder was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on July 9, 1968 to Jacob Felder (born in Ustrzyki, Poland, 1929) and Eva Surek Felder (born in Budapest, Hungary, 1946). A first-generation North-American, much of Felder’s upbringing included Eastern European traditions, in particular traditions associated with the Jewish faith into which he was born. Early schooling included Hebrew Academy Day School of Montreal as well as synagogue affiliations with Tifereth Beth David Jerusalem Synagogue in Côte Saint-Luc, Quebec.
In 1976, Felder’s mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She died six years later, at the age of 35, leaving Hershey and his younger sister, Tammy (b. 1973), to be raised by their father alone. In 1989, while pursuing a career in theater and music, Felder met an actress at the Yiddish Theatre of the Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts in Montreal. They were married in 1991 and the couple divorced in 1993.
In 1994, Felder made his way to Los Angeles where he spent a brief time working for Steven Spielberg’s Shoah Foundation interviewing Holocaust survivors in order to catalog their oral histories on film. The following year, he was invited to take part as one of four interviewers to attend the 50th anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz in Poland, which led to his creation of "George Gershwin Alone". Upon returning to the United States, Felder was invited to present a concert performance at the Canadian Consular Residence in Los Angeles, in honor of Kim Campbell, Canada’s only female Prime Minister. Reports of this meeting reference a "love at first sight" encounter, and Felder and Campbell, 21 years his senior, have been inseparable ever since. One year later, in September 1997, Felder and Campbell entered into an official common law marriage, recognized by Canadian Law.
After Campbell's departure from Canadian politics and governmental duties, Campbell and Felder moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Campbell was a Professor of Practice at Harvard University's Kennedy School for Government, and Felder was invited to open a production of "George Gershwin Alone" at the American Repertory Theatre at Harvard. This production went on to be the highest-grossing production of any booked in production in the theatre's history. In 2004, Felder and Campbell moved to Chicago where Felder opened a production of "George Gershwin Alone" as well as presenting the world premiere of "Monsieur Chopin". At this time, Campbell was named a Vice President and the Secretary General of the Club of Madrid, an organization of over 70 former heads of state and government who promote democratic transition. Felder and Campbell currently split their time between North America and Europe while they both continue to be before the public internationally.
Affiliations.
Felder and Joel Zwick are recognized as full-time collaborators with Zwick directing stage work for all of Felder’s artistic projects.
Felder is a former Scholar in Residence at Harvard University’s School Of Music (2002–2004) and a former member of the Board of Directors of the Chicago College of Performing Arts, where he created and sponsored a classical music competition entitled "The Real Thing."
He has presented Master Classes in Music and Theatre Arts at: The Chicago College of Performing Arts, The University of Pennsylvania, The Boston Conservatory, The Old Globe Theatre (San Diego).
Jeffrey Kallberg, a Professor of Music and Chairman of the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Music, acts as musical history advisor on all of Felder’s projects.

Harry Jarman

Harry Jarman (1883 – 13 December 1928) was a Welsh international forward who played club rugby for Newport and Pontypool. He won four caps for Wales and also played for the British Isles in their 1910 tour of South Africa. In 1928 Jarman died when he threw himself in front of a runaway coal truck which was heading towards a group of playing children.
Rugby career.
Jarman was born in Talywain, and joined Talywain Rugby Club and in 1908 joined first class side Newport and in December of that year turned out for the club against the touring Australian team.
Jarman made his debut for Wales against England in the 1910 Five Nations Championship under the captaincy of Billy Trew. He joined fellow Newport team-mates Jack Jones and Charlie Pritchard in the first ever international to be held at Twickenham. Wales lost the game 11-6 beginning a twenty-year losing streak at the London ground. Jarman was back in the squad for the next game of the tournament against Scotland, in a home game at the Cardiff Arms Park. The Welsh beat Scotland, a feat the team would repeat against Ireland in Jarman's third game on 12 March 1910. His final game was against England in the 1911 Championship, this time with Home advantage, at St Helens in Swansea, Wales won the match, and although Jarman played no further part, the team won the Grand Slam.
Jarman was chosen, between the 1910 and 1911 Five nations Championship, to join Tommy Smyth's British Isles team to tour South Africa. Jarman played in all three tests and was rated as one of the best forwards of the touring side.

Papyrus 28

Papyrus 28 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by 𝔓28, is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Gospel of John, it contains only one leaf with the text of the Gospel of John 6:8-12.17-22. The manuscript paleographically has been assigned to the late 3rd century.
Description.

Text.
The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type (rather proto-Alexandrian). Aland placed it in Category I. According to Aland it represents a "normal text". This manuscript displays a closest agreement with 𝔓75 (in 7 out of 10 variants). According to Grenfell and Hunt it is closer to Vaticanus than to Sinaiticus. Only in one case it supports Codex Alexandrinus against Sinaiticus and Vaticanus (John 6:11). Grenfell and Hunt noted that text is not "very correctly spelled". It has five unique readings. In John 6:10 it has πεντακισ]χιλειοι, ελεβεν instead of ελαβεν, in 6:19 ενγυς instead of εγγυς, in 6:20 φοβεισθαι instead of φοβεισθε, in 6:22 ιδεν instead of ειδεν.

Shakespeare Birthplace Trust

The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust (SBT) is an independent registered educational charity based in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England, that came into existence in 1847 following the purchase of William Shakespeare's birthplace for preservation as a national memorial. It can also lay claim to be the oldest conservation society in Britain. Receiving no government funding or public subsidies, it is totally dependent upon the public for support, and relies on donations and the income generated from visitors.
The SBT is considered the most significant Shakespeare charity in the world, and endeavours to internationally promote the appreciation and study of the plays and other works of William Shakespeare, and general advancements of Shakespearian knowledge. The Trust maintains and preserves the Shakespeare Birthplace properties, a museum, library of books, manuscripts, records of historic interest, pictures, photographs and objects of antiquity with particular reference to the life and times of William Shakespeare, and is also home to the headquarters of the International Shakespeare Association.
Origins of the Trust.
For more than 200 years after the Bard's death, his birthplace was occupied by the descendants of his recently widowed sister, Joan Hart. Under the terms of Shakespeare's will, the ownership of the whole property (the inn and Joan Hart's cottage) passed to his elder daughter, Susanna; and then on her death in 1649, to her only child, Elizabeth. Elizabeth died in 1670, bequeathing it to Thomas Hart, the descendant of Shakespeare's sister, Joan, whose family had continued as tenants of the cottage after her death in 1646. The Harts remained owners of the whole property until 1806, when it was sold to a butcher, Thomas Court. When it was again put up for sale in 1846 on the death of Court's widow, the American showman P. T. Barnum proposed to buy the home and ship it "brick-by-brick" to the US. To purchase the property for the Nation, the Shakespeare Birthday Committee was formed, and such luminaries as Charles Dickens helped the Committee raise £3,000 and bought it the following year. Incorporated by a private Act of Parliament, the Birthday Committee became the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
Properties.
The headquarters of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust is the Shakespeare Centre, a glass and concrete structure next to the Birthplace. The driving force behind its construction and opening in 1964 was Dr Levi Fox, OBE, Director of the Trust from 1945 to 1989, with a view to properly housing its library, documents and collections which attract scholars from all over the world.
The Trust currently owns and cares for a number of houses relating to Shakespeare in and around the town of Stratford-upon-Avon as well as for Harvard House:
Library and archive.
The Library and Records Office, now amalgamated to form the Shakespeare Centre Library and Archive, house the Shakespeare and Local Collections:
Museums department.
The Museums Department is responsible for the care and display of all the historic museum items that the trust owns, principally items that relate to Shakespeare's life and times, which encompass a wide range of material. Other collections include items that represent the social and economic life of Stratford-upon-Avon, and a special collection of pewter, dating from Roman times until the present day. The Trust's Collections and Conservation Department is based in the Shakespeare Centre in Stratford-upon-Avon.
The Trust owns various extensive collections:
Education and activities.
The Trust hosts a variety of events and provides talks, lectures and courses related to Shakespeare for the general public, and for students at all levels ranging from primary school pupils (with the Heritage Education team) to university students. Through its education department, the Trust also runs international programmes throughout the year on Shakespeare's writings.
The SBT runs the Stratford-upon-Avon Poetry Festival, the oldest in the UK. The SBT introduced the new Shakespeare Film Festival to its events calendar in 2012, the first festival of its kind in the UK.
At Mary Arden's Farm the SBT rears prize-winning livestock including Cotswold sheep and Longhorn cattle.

Cotehill railway station

Cotehill railway station was a railway station on the Settle-Carlisle Railway in England between Armathwaite and Cumwhinton. The line opened for passengers in 1876. The Ordnance Survey map published in the year 1900 shows the station serving the point at which a tramway from Knothill Plaster and Cement Works meets the Settle-Carlisle. The tramway continued from Knothill to Boaterby Quarry. According to Tyler, Knothill was one of the first Gypsum sites in Cumbria
The station is named after the nearest village but this is away and extremely small. It is closer to the site of Englethwaite Hall which was built by John Thomlinson in 1879 but demolished by 1969, the site now being the location of a Caravan Club campsite. It is clear from the map that the sparse local population could not have sustained a railway station. In addition, the station is only from Armathwaite and very close to Cumwhinton, both of which had stations of their own.
The tramway is absent from later maps, though its route is clearly visible as a track on the 1951 map. The station closed in 1952. Unusually for this line, the passenger buildings were demolished. The site remains clear so could in principle be re-used. One end of it is occupied by a communication mast. The stationmaster's house and railway workers' cottages are immediately adjacent to the Cotehill Viaduct, where the railway crosses High Stand Gill near where it flows into the Eden. The houses are privately occupied.

Against All Odds (video game)

Against All Odds is an Adobe Flash video game developed by UNHCR designed to teach players about the plight of refugees. Originally released in Swedish in 2005, the game has been translated into several languages, the English edition of which was released in November 2007.
Initial funding for the project came from a grant of NOK 1 million from Statoil to UNHCR's Baltic and Nordic regional office, with the aim of developing a project to reach young people and promote integration in the region. UNHCR sought advice from Umeå University regarding interactive media for schools, and discussed ideas with the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training and the Swedish Integration Board.
UNHCR decided to proceed the project as a web-based game, a medium which could reach a large number of young people, require no distribution costs and minimal marketing costs. The game was aimed at 12 - 15 year olds, an age where people began to develop ideas regarding refugees and similar issues.
In "Against All Odds", the player takes the role of a refugee, and plays through twelve stages - depicting his persecution and flight from his native country, through to eventual integration into a foreign country as an asylum seeker. Complementing the game is a facts repository detailing the history of asylum, and refugee testimonies. A teacher's guide section provides discussion points and lesson ideas for the classroom. The game takes approximately 45 minutes to play through, coinciding with the typical length of a lesson.
Reception has been positive, prompting translations into multiple languages from its original Swedish. In 2006, the German edition of the game, "LastExitFlucht" was awarded the Austrian State Prize for Multimedia and e-Business in the Knowledge and Learning category. The jury praised the game for building understanding, empathy and concern for the plight of refugees in the player.

Captain Abu Raed

Captain Abu Raed (Arabic: كابتن أبو رائد) is a 2007 Jordanian Film directed and written by Amin Matalqa. It is the first feature film produced in Jordan in more than 50 years. The Royal Film Commission of Jordan endorsed "Captain Abu Raed" to be submitted to the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, the first ever submitted by Jordan. The film won awards at numerous film festivals including the Sundance Film Festival, Heartland Film Festival, and the Dubai International Film Festival. It was screened at the Jerusalem International Film Festival in 2008.
Plot.
Abu Raed is an airport janitor at the Queen Alia International Airport in Amman. After finding a Royal Jordanian captain's hat in the trash, the neighborhood children mistake him for an airline pilot and beg him to tell them stories of his adventures. At first refusing, he later concedes and tells them about his fictional travels to England, France, and New York, earning the name "Captain Abu Raed"
An older child, Murad, knows who Abu Raed really is and sets out to prove this to the other children wrong, repeating the phrase "People like us don't grow up to be pilots." With some dinars he found, Murad takes the other children on a taxi ride to the airport to show them the truth about Abu Raed. The children are heartbroken at seeing their idol on his hands and knees, scrubbing the floor.
It is later shown that Murad had stolen the money from his father Abu Murad, who, drunk after a hard day selling women's clothing on the street, often abused Murad's mother, Um Murad. Abu Murad was exceptionally mad about the loss of money and took it out on his wife.
Abu Raed, after being exposed as a phony, forgave Murad and gave him the pilot hat as a token of forgiveness. Later, Murad steals a model airplane and gets his hand burned by his father for it. Abu Raed is there to comfort him, creating a bond between the two. This event convinces Abu Raed to find a way to bring Murad, his younger brother, and his mother to safety.
Meanwhile, at the airport and on the bus home, Abu Raed gets to know Nour, a female pilot whose wealthy father poorly attempted to find her a husband. During a friendly visit to his home, he tells her about his past, including a deceased wife and son, Raed.
Abu Raed also had to deal with Tareq, one of the children whom he told stories to, whose father had him selling wafers on the street rather than going to school. Abu Raed knew he was a smart boy so he bought all of his wafers so Tareq could attend school. However, this was a mixed blessing as Abu Tareq would then give Tareq more wafers to sell, seeing as he was a good salesman.
One night, before Abu Murad gets home, Abu Raed develops a plan to protect Murad and his family. Nour volunteers to take them in, because her wealthy family owns a large house. She brings her car to the living area where Abu Raed and the Murads live, and they hurriedly pack the belongings of the Murad family. As they are about to leave, Murad runs back to retrieve the pilot's cap, a symbol of his dreams and aspirations. Nour then sets off for her house, as Tareq appears and asks what is going on, to which Abu Raed replies, "Nothing." Tareq becomes the last person, other than a drunk Abu Murad, to see Abu Raed alive.
Despite repeated warnings from Um Murad that "He's going to kill you", Abu Raed sits in the Murad apartment and awaits Abu Murad's return. Upon finding his house empty, Abu Murad threatens Abu Raed's life. Abu Raed is implied to have been killed in that apartment. Years later, a grown-up Murad is seen watching the airfield as a Royal Jordanian pilot.
Setting.
Many of the movie's open scenes are set on the well-known Roman ruins high above Amman, on Jabal al-Qal'a. The "Making of Captain Abu Raed" on the Western release of the DVD points out that although the movie takes place entirely in Amman and the airport, the neighborhood surrounding Abu Raed's home was shot in the neighboring old city of Salt. 
Although the date of the movie is never specified by any notes or characters, the usage of the Eastern Arabic numerals on vehicles' license plates implies that the movie takes place in the past, as a recollection from youth by the adult Captain Murad. Jordan switched from the Eastern Arabic numeral system to standard Arabic numerals in the 1990s.

Magnus (novel)

Magnus is a novel by the Orcadian author George Mackay Brown. His second novel, it was published in 1973. it is a fictional account of the life and execution of the twelfth century Saint, Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney.
Plot introduction.
Easily Mackay Brown's most religious novel - written after he was received into the Roman Catholic Church - it is seen principally from the perspective of outsiders (peasants, mercenaries, schoolfriends, tinkers) which Mackay Brown interleaves with the Christian tradition of the Seamless robe of Jesus. 
The narrative implies that Magnus's life is a preordained quest for the garment as a manifested object. It moves swiftly from Magnus's conception to his boyhood at the monastery on Birsay, his non-violent participation at the Battle of Menai Strait (depicted in the "Orkneyinga Saga") to the political manoeuvring and outright conflict between Magnus and his cousin Earl Hakon Paulsson. 
The narrative also reflects on the damage this inflicted on the inhabitants of the islands. At the pivotal moment of Magnus's execution by Hakon, the narrative switches to Flossenbürg concentration camp during World War II . Magnus's unwitting executioner Lifolf becomes a cook at the camp, co-opted into the hanging of the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer by the camp's drunk Nazi commanding officers. 
The story returns to twelfth century Orkney, and concludes with the tinkers, Jock and Mary (present since the outset of the tale). Jock prays to the tomb of the (as yet uncanonised) 'Saint' Magnus, but is reprimanded by Brother Colomb, Magnus's former teacher. However not long after, Mary, hitherto blinded by cataracts, suddenly has her sight restored.
Throughout the novel, Mackay Brown contrasts the inevitable nature of Magnus's fate with the symbolic significance of pre-Christian ritual, including human sacrifice. Despite this, critics have noted the deeply meditative nature of the work despite the bloody events it depicts and the harshness of existence in twelfth century Orkney.
"The Martyrdom of St. Magnus".
In 1977 the English composer Peter Maxwell Davies adapted Mackay Brown's story into a one-act opera. Davies begins the story at the Battle of Menai Strait, and retains the flash forward to the Twentieth century for Magnus's execution. In this version the location and person of the victim is unnamed.
It was commissioned by the BBC for the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. It was first performed in Kirkwall at the first St Magnus Festival, with Neil Mackie as Magnus and the Fires of London conducted by Peter Maxwell Davies. The production was directed by Murray Melvin. Davies later recorded the opera (with different forces) for Unicorn-Kanchana records.

Levi Fox

Dr. Levi Fox OBE, DL, MA, FSA, FRHistS, FRSL (28 August 1914 – 3 September 2006), was the son of a Leicestershire smallholder. He became Archivist for the city of Coventry and then Director of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, and was a conservationist, local historian, and author.
Early life.
After attending Ashby-de-la-Zouch Grammar School where he became head boy, Fox was a Bryce research student in Oriel College, Oxford and gained a first class Honours degree in History. He then spent some time doing research at the University of Manchester before being appointed the first city archivist for Coventry.
Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
Declared unfit for war service, Fox was appointed Director of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust (SBT) in 1945 and built a loyal team around him.
The SBT can lay claim to be the oldest conservation society in Britain. Under Fox's direction many activities of the Trust, including its education work, records office, museums and gardens departments, and its conservation activities, developed and expanded greatly; and he saw the centre at Stratford-upon-Avon grow from a local organisation of some national significance into a body of international repute. The SBT is entirely dependent on its income from visitors to the Shakespeare properties and investments, and, under Fox it acquired some important properties. These include the land around Anne Hathaway's cottage and Hall's Croft, the home of Shakespeare's daughter and her husband, John Hall; as well as Glebe Farm at Wilmcote, next to the supposed childhood home of Shakespeare's mother (Mary Arden), when it was threatened by developers in 1968.
A major landmark was the opening of the Shakespeare Centre in Henley Street, next to Shakespeare's Birthplace, in 1964; built to better accommodate the SBT's library and collection of documents that attract scholars from all over the world. Fox worked tirelessly to further the cause of Shakespeare, served as secretary and deputy Chairman of the International Shakespeare Committee, and produced numerous books and articles. Also in 1964, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from The George Washington University.
On the occasion of his retirement from the SBT on 26 September 1989, Fox unveiled a commemorative plaque commissioned by the Executive Committee of the Trust in recognition of his service and achievements as its director. The plaque was carved by Paul Vincze with letters by Richard James Kindersley and hangs in the foyer of the Shakespeare Centre.
In retirement from the age of 75 years, as Director Emeritus of the Trust Fox continued to take great interest in its affairs. He was enthusiastic about such changes as the transition from the museum feel of the SBT's historic houses into more accurately exhibited and lively period homes. He was particularly pleased to discover in 2000 that Glebe Farm, the house he had saved from destruction, was the genuine home of Shakespeare's mother.
Other activities.
Fox held the position of Deputy Keeper of the Records of Stratford-Upon-Avon, and from 1949–91 he was a trustee of Harvard House, home to the mother of the founder of Harvard University. He also served as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School for Girls, and of King Edward VI School for Boys where the Levi Fox Hall, opened in 1997, is named in his honour. 
He was an eminent local historian, and published extensively on the history of Stratford-upon-Avon and on the Midlands in general, serving for many years as secretary and general editor of the Dugdale Society.
Personal life.
Fox and his wife Jane, whom he married in 1938, had three children.
He possessed entrepreneurial, organisational and communication skills and academic abilities. For example; on the night of 14 November 1940, when a German air raid destroyed much of Coventry, he took on the task of food distribution with great efficiency.
Fox died 3 September 2006 at the age of 92 years.

On the curb is a financial term that describes the act of trading securities outside the mainstream stock exchange, either because the company operating the exchange has very strict listing requirements (cf: alternative stock exchange) or because investors are so interested to continue trading even after the official business hours that they set up alternative avenues for their trading, sometimes even the curbs outside the main stock exchange, which is the origin of the phrase.

<doc id="19909603" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19909603" title="Sibton Abbey">
Sibton Abbey

Sibton Abbey, an early Cistercian abbey located near Yoxford, Suffolk, was founded about 1150 by William de Chesney, High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk. A sister house of Warden Abbey, near Bedford, Bedfordshire, Sibton Abbey was the only Cistercian abbey in East Anglia.
Sibton Abbey was founded by the normal complement of 13 monks, but by the thirteenth century the numbers of monks and lay brothers had grown, and the Abbey had grown rich, owning lands across southeast England, including estates in Norfolk, Suffolk and on the borders of Cambridgeshire, as well as within 10 parishes of the city of Norwich. From the beginning of the thirteenth century the Abbey also hosted a hospital at its gate dedicated to St. John the Baptist which cared for the sick. The Abbey was one of the main religious houses under control of the Bishop of Norwich in the See of Norwich. Sibton's architectural style was in the austere Cistercian model.
In the intervening years, Sibton grew rich on proceeds from the wool trade, which built so many grand English churches. Although Suffolk wool wasn't of the finest quality, according to some historians, often stained with tar or grease, it was nevertheless in great demand, particularly in East Anglia, which had many Flemish weavers anxious to convert it into exportable cloth. 
At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Sibton Abbey's annual income was £250, a hefty sum which should have bought the Abbey an additional couple of years before it was dissolved. But the recently appointed Abbot William Flatbury, installed at the insistence of the Duke of Norfolk, apparently was prevailed upon by the Duke and by Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, to hasten the Dissolution, and yield the jewel to those in Royal favour. The engineering of Flatbury's appointment, according to a contemporaneous observer, had been done with the "connivance of Cromwell on purpose to bring about a speedy surrender."
In 1536 the Abbey and its riches were transferred to Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. The Duke subsequently sold the Abbey again to Thomas Godsalve, who in turn sold it to Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk.
In 1610 the Abbey and Manor were sold to John Scrivener, son of Ralph Scrivener, an Ipswich barrister grown rich in the wool trade, and the family built an estate nearby. John Scrivener's brother Matthew was an early Governor of the Virginia Colony, where he drowned in 1609. John Scrivener's sister Elizabeth was married to Harbottle Wingfield of Crowfield Hall, Suffolk, cousin of Edward Maria Wingfield, the first President of the Jamestown Colony. John Scrivener's son, Thomas Scrivener Esq., married Mary Bedingfield, only daughter and heir of William Bedingfield, of Fressingfield, Suffolk and a relation of Sir Henry Bedingfield.
Today Sibton Abbey is a picturesque ruin, largely overgrown, with the refectory and the south wall of the nave still visible. The Abbey and the Manor remain in the hands of the Scrivener heirs, today's Levett-Scrivener family, and the ruins are private. Many of the chartularies of the old Abbey were transferred to the East Suffolk Record Office by J.E. Levett-Scrivener Esq., who also transferred some of the Abbey's early medieval music.
In centuries past, the Levett-Scrivener family sometimes made the ruins available to county historical societies and historians. The Abbey ruins and the adjoining estate are Grade II listed buildings. The buildings are not open to the public.

Next-generation network services is a jargon term with no specific meaning. The term is used, in some telecommunication communities, in a loose way to refer to services that have not traditionally been provided by telecommunication operators circuit switched networks. Services include VoIP, IPTV, presence-based applications, instant messaging and location-based services. All of these example services are deployed and used on the Internet or private IP networks and access is available to them from traditional circuit switched networks.
Standards bodies and industry support forums.
Various industry forums have emerged to promote as well as standardize the evolving services of next generation networks. These new network services leverage a common IMS core for a horizontal signaling layer.
These forums generally host interoperability events in which multiple vendors show that services based on standards promoted by the forums can actually be deployed. They also publish specifications and interoperability agreements in parallel with standards bodies.

French ship Robuste (1806)

The Robuste was an 80-gun "Bucentaure"-class 80-gun ship of the line of the French Navy, designed by Jacques-Noël Sané.
She was commissioned under Captain Louis-Antoine-Cyprien Infernet, and was later captained by Julien Cosmao.
From April 1809, she was the flagship of a squadron.
In late 1809, Vice-Admiral Honoré Joseph Antoine Ganteaume was organising shipment of reinforcements to Barcelona. "Robuste" became the flagship of a squadron under Julien Cosmao, along with "Donawerth", "Génois", "Borée" and "Lion", as well as the frigates "Pauline" and "Pénélope", and a dozen of transports. The fleet departed Toulon on 24 April 1809, and returned on 1 May without incident.
In October, the squadron attempted another ferry, under Rear-Admiral François Baudin. On 21 October the French were detected by HMS "Pomone", which reported to Lord Collingwood's squadron. Collingwood sent his three frigates as a vanguard and sailed with 15 ships of the line to intercept the French. On the morning of 23 October HMS "Volontaire" detected and reported the French squadron's position.
The British gave chase, but lost contact. HMS "Tigre" detected "Robuste", "Borée", "Lion" and "Pauline" at dawn on 24 October, but the fleets lost contact again. Contact was re-established in the morning of 25 October, the French sailing close to the shore, and the chase resumed. "Robuste" and "Lion" ran aground around noon near Frontignan. After two hours of fruitless attempts to save the ships, Baudin ordered them scuttled, and they were set on fire in the evening. They exploded at 10h30.

Minneapolis Golf Club

Minneapolis Golf Club is a golf club located in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Designed by Willie Park, Jr. and Donald Ross, the Minneapolis golf course opened in 1917. The club hosted the U.S. Amateur in 1950 as well as the PGA Championship in 1959, which Bob Rosburg won.
Club history.
In 1916, there were only two golf clubs in Minneapolis, Minikahda Country Club and Interlachen Country Club In early 1916, five members of the Minneapolis Athletic Club set plans to establish another golf club to meet the growing popularity of the game. By July, the Minneapolis Golf Club ("MGC") was incorporated. Land was acquired and nine holes were built on the site of present day Golden Valley Country Club The opening of play at MGC commenced on the first Saturday of August 1916. Later that year, the club was approached by Hyland Homes Company to consider the purchase of a larger piece of intact farmland in St. Louis Park. The Scottish architect Willie Park Jr. had been retained to lay out the golf course. On December 9, 1916, the MGC membership voted to relocate to the present location. By June 19, 1917, MGC had become one of the earliest member clubs of the Minnesota Golf Association.
By 1918, MGC had 400 members and there was a regular shuttle service to and from the Minneapolis Athletic Club operating during the golf season. In September 1919, plans were initiated to build a new clubhouse to accommodate the now larger membership. The original clubhouse was a converted four-room farmhouse located near the present third tee. The new clubhouse was to be built on the northern section of the property. It opened on May 12, 1923. The rolling farmland our course was built on was virtually void of trees except for a stand of oaks in the northern section by today's 10th and 11th holes. The trees that line the fairways today were planted during a tree-planting program in 1930.
Course architects.
Two Scots, Willie Park, Jr. (1864–1925) of Musselburgh and Donald J. Ross (1872–1948) of Dornoch, at different times designed and routed the golf course. On November 26, 1916, "The Minneapolis Tribune" wrote, "Willie Park, well known golf course architect, arrived yesterday to lay out the course of the Minneapolis Golf Club". Discovered field notes of the original land survey firm show that Park routed the course in early December 1916. Ross' involvement is demonstrated thorough a routing plan of the course executed by Donald J. Ross Associates, Inc. in 1920 that was recently found by the Chair of the History Committee of the Donald Ross Society. The two routings will be framed and displayed within the clubhouse.
Golf events.
MGC has a great golfing tradition. It developed in part due to the quality design of the golf course. By the mid-1920s, MGC was growing in local and national recognition. In 1940, after Sam Snead played an exhibition match at MGC, he said that he "hoped that (MGC) would some day host a U.S. Open". The most prestigious amateur event was the Golden Anniversary (50th) U.S. Amateur in 1950. As result of holding the 1959 PGA Championship at MGC, the club is in elite company as one of only 120 golf clubs in the world to have hosted a Grand Slam event (Masters, U.S. Open, British Open, and PGA) since 1860.

Dallas Athletic Club

Dallas Athletic Club, known as DAC, is a private country club located in Dallas, Texas. It was founded in 1919, and was originally located in its own building at the corner of St. Paul and Live Oak streets in downtown Dallas. In 1954, freeway expansion in Dallas forced the club to relocate. It then purchased 317 acres of land to the east of Dallas, located near what is now the northwest corner of the eastern intersection of Interstate 30 and Interstate 635 (Texas) near Mesquite, Texas, a Dallas suburb. The club then became more focused on golf and tennis, whereas the downtown location had included a barber shop, billiards, guest and residential suites, ballrooms, dining rooms, lounges, handball and squash courts, swimming pools and a health services department. 
There are two golf courses at the club, the Blue Course and the Gold Course. Both courses, in their current form, were designed by Jack Nicklaus, who had won the 1963 PGA Championship, held at DAC. The Blue Course was originally designed by Ralph Plummer. Young Lee Trevino began in golf by caddying at the club in the mid-1950s.

Lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide

Lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide (LA-SS-Az, LSZ) is an analog of LSD developed by the team led by David E. Nichols at Purdue University. It was developed as a rigid analog of LSD with the diethylamide group constrained into an azetidine ring in order to map the binding site at the 5-HT2A receptor. There are three possible stereoisomers around the azetidine ring, with the (S,S)-(+) isomer being the most active, slightly more potent than LSD itself in drug discrimination tests using trained rats.
There have been several unconfirmed reports of lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide being synthesized in illicit laboratories and distributed on blotter paper or in liquid solution under names such as "diazedine" and "λ". 
In 2013 LSZ also appeared on some designer drug and research chemical markets in the UK.

Water – Use It Wisely is a water conservation campaign originally launched on behalf of metropolitan Phoenix, Mesa, Scottsdale and the Arizona Department of Water Resources. The campaign provides states, cities and citizens with simple tips and tricks to help them save water in their home and throughout the community.
Water - Use It Wisely launched in Arizona in 2000. It has since expanded into a multi-million dollar campaign with more than 250 public and private water companies Nationwide.
Interested parties are provided with customizable marketing materials that they can tailor to their city or town and use at their disposal.
A study taken the Behavior Research Center pointed to the effectiveness of the effort by the amount of recognition within the community. The study said that after 18 months of the exposure to the campaign, there is 69 percent recognition and calls for conservation assistance jumped from 8,494 in 1999 to 14,649 in 2001.
One of the latest cities to get involved in the campaign is Durham, North Carolina where they recently held a Water – Use It Wisely Sales Event encouraging residents to exchange old shower heads for new, free, water-efficient shower heads.
Water – Use It Wisely was recently featured as a “Go Green Action Step” in best-selling author David Bach’s recent title, Go Green, Live Rich.

<doc id="19910023" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19910023" title="Pulmonary hypoplasia">
Pulmonary hypoplasia

Pulmonary hypoplasia is incomplete development of the lungs, resulting in an abnormally low number or size of bronchopulmonary segments or alveoli. A congenital malformation, it most often occurs secondary to other fetal abnormalities that interfere with normal development of the lungs. Primary (idiopathic) pulmonary hypoplasia is rare and usually not associated with other maternal or fetal abnormalities.
Incidence of pulmonary hypoplasia ranges from 9–11 per 10,000 live births and 14 per 10,000 births. Pulmonary hypoplasia is a common cause of neonatal death. It also is a common finding in stillbirths, although not regarded as a cause of these.
Causes.
Causes of pulmonary hypoplasia include a wide variety of congenital malformations and other conditions in which pulmonary hypoplasia is a complication. These include congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, fetal hydronephrosis, caudal regression syndrome, mediastinal tumor, and sacrococcygeal teratoma with a large component inside the fetus. Large masses of the neck (such as cervical teratoma) also can cause pulmonary hypoplasia, presumably by interfering with the fetus's ability to fill its lungs. In the presence of pulmonary hypoplasia, the EXIT procedure to rescue a baby with a neck mass is not likely to succeed.
Fetal hydrops can be a cause, or conversely a complication.
Pulmonary hypoplasia is associated with oligohydramnios through multiple mechanisms. Both conditions can result from blockage of the urinary bladder. Blockage prevents the bladder from emptying, and the bladder becomes very large and full. The large volume of the full bladder interferes with normal development of other organs, including the lungs. Pressure within the bladder becomes abnormally high, causing abnormal function in the kidneys hence abnormally high pressure in the vascular system entering the kidneys. This high pressure also interferes with normal development of other organs. An experiment in rabbits showed that PH also can be caused directly by oligohydramnios.
Pulmonary hypoplasia is associated with dextrocardia of embryonic arrest in that both conditions can result from early errors of development, resulting in Congenital cardiac disorders.
PH is a common direct cause of neonatal death resulting from pregnancy induced hypertension.
Diagnosis.
Medical diagnosis of pulmonary hypoplasia in utero may use imaging, usually ultrasound or MRI. The extent of hypoplasia is a very important prognostic factor. One study of 147 fetuses (49 normal, 98 with abnormalities) found that a simple measurement, the ratio of chest length to trunk (torso) length, was a useful predictor of postnatal respiratory distress. In a study of 23 fetuses, subtle differences seen on MRIs of the lungs were informative. In a study of 29 fetuses with suspected pulmonary hypoplasia, the group that responded to maternal oxygenation had a more favorable outcome.
Pulmonary hypoplasia is diagnosed also clinically.
Management.
Management has three components: interventions before delivery, timing and place of delivery, and therapy after delivery.
In some cases, fetal therapy is available for the underlying condition; this may help to limit the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia. In exceptional cases, fetal therapy may include fetal surgery.
A 1992 case report of a baby with a sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) reported that the SCT had obstructed the outlet of the urinary bladder causing the bladder to rupture in utero and fill the baby's abdomen with urine (a form of ascites). The outcome was good. The baby had normal kidneys and lungs, leading the authors to conclude that obstruction occurred late in the pregnancy and to suggest that the rupture may have protected the baby from the usual complications of such an obstruction. Subsequent to this report, use of a vesicoamniotic shunting procedure (VASP) has been attempted, with limited success.
Often, a baby with a high risk of pulmonary hypoplasia will have a planned delivery in a specialty hospital such as (in the United States) a tertiary referral hospital with a level 3 neonatal intensive-care unit. The baby may require immediate advanced resuscitation and therapy.
Early delivery may be required in order to rescue the fetus from an underlying condition that is causing pulmonary hypoplasia. However, pulmonary hypoplasia increases the risks associated with preterm birth, because once delivered the baby requires adequate lung capacity to sustain life. The decision whether to deliver early includes a careful assessment of the extent to which delaying delivery may increase or decrease the pulmonary hypoplasia. It is a choice between expectant management and active management. An example is congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation with hydrops; impending heart failure may require a preterm delivery. Severe oligohydramnios of early onset and long duration, as can occur with early preterm rupture of membranes, can cause increasingly severe PH; if delivery is postponed by many weeks, PH can become so severe that it results in neonatal death. 
After delivery, most affected babies will require supplemental oxygen. Some severely affected babies may be saved with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Not all specialty hospitals have ECMO, and ECMO is considered the therapy of last resort for pulmonary insufficiency. An alternative to ECMO is high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.
History.
In 1908, Maude Abbott documented pulmonary hypoplasia occurring with certain defects of the heart. In 1915, Abbott and J. C. Meakins showed that pulmonary hypoplasia was part of the differential diagnosis of dextrocardia. In 1920, decades before the advent of prenatal imaging, the presence of pulmonary hypoplasia was taken as evidence that diaphragmatic hernias in babies were congenital, not acquired.

Jenny Lake Ranger Station Historic District

The Jenny Lake Ranger Station Historic District comprises an area that was the main point of visitor contact in Grand Teton National Park from the 1930s to 1960. Located near Jenny Lake, the buildings are a mixture of purpose-built structures and existing buildings that were adapted for use by the National Park Service. The ranger station was built as a cabin by Lee Mangus north of Moose, Wyoming about 1925 and was moved and rebuilt around 1930 for Park Service use. A store was built by a concessioner, and comfort stations were built to Park Service standard plans. All buildings were planned to the prevailing National Park Service Rustic style, although the ranger station and the photo shop were built from parts of buildings located elsewhere in the park.
Ranger station.
The ranger station was reconstructed from a cabin originally built by Lee Manges about 1925 which was acquired by the National Park Service in 1930 and moved to the present site. The small rectangular log cabin features a log pole front porch, with decorative half-log sheathing in a V-pattern on its gable.
Crandall Studio.
The Crandall Photo Studio was built just east of String Lake in 1925-26 and moved to the Jenny Lake site after Harrison Crandall's property was purchased by the Park Service in 1931. The studio operated at Jenny Lake until 1958, when the Grand Teton Lodge Company bought out Crandall's concession contract. Crandall, a Kansan, arrived in Jackson Hole in 1921. He returned the following year with his wife Hildegarde, and established a homestead claim in 1923 near the present Jenny Lake Lodge, where he built the cabin. Crandall sold scenic pictures of the Tetons as well as souvenir shots of dudes at the many dude ranches in Jackson Hole. Crandall also painted, his work appearing in magazines and collected by John D. Rockefeller, Jr.
The studio-visitor center consists of two main rooms in a long, deep log structure, with a high open ceiling lighted by clerestory windows in roof monitors.
Comfort stations.
The comfort stations were built in 1934 and 1935 from Park Service standard plans by Civilian Conservation Corps labor, based at Jenny Lake CCC Camp NP-4.
Present use.
The district still serves as a point of visitor contact, but was superseded as the primary contact center with the construction of Mission 66 facilities at Moose, which themselves have recently been replaced by newer facilities. The Crandall Studio, formerly used is a book and gift store by the Grand Teton Association, as well as functioning as a small visitor center. The ranger station is no longer a primary visitor contact point, a function now fulfilled by the Crandall Studio, but the comfort stations remain in use. The ranger station is now used as a base for climbing rangers and to issue climbing permits. The district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1990.

Climate of Moscow

Moscow has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification "Dfb") with warm, sometimes hot, somewhat humid summers and long, cold winters.
Typical high temperatures in the warm months of June, July and August are around , but during heat waves, which can occur anytime from May to September, daytime temperature highs often top for sometimes one or two weeks. In the winter, temperatures normally drop to approximately , though there can be periods of warmth with temperatures rising above . Summer lasts from mid-May to the beginning of September. Winter lasts from the beginning of November to the end of March. 
Monthly averages and records for Moscow.
The highest temperature ever recorded was on July 29, and minimum temperature recorded was -18 degree in 1923. 2010 In 2007 three record highs for the month occurred – January + , March + , and May + ; in 2008, there were new record highs for December and the entire winter: + . On July 23, 2010, the temperature reached and continued to set record highs each following day until it finally reached + on July 29, 2010. In November 2010 a new month record high of + occurred (after +12.6 in 1927).
Average annual temperature in Moscow is , but recently (2007, 2008) it has been higher than . In the first half of the 20th century, there was light night frost in late summer.
Monthly rainfall totals vary minimally throughout the year, although the precipitation levels tend to be higher during the summer than during the winter. Due to the significant variation in temperature between the winter and summer months as well as the limited fluctuation in precipitation levels during the summer, Moscow is considered to be within a continental climate zone.
Most of records and averages are given for VVC weather station, located in the North-Eastern administrative okrug of Moscow. The temperature from this station averages 0,5–1 °C lower than in the city center, and 0,5–2 °C higher than night minimums in the suburbs.
Type of precipitation.
Most precipitation in Moscow falls as rain, but in winter months almost all precipitation falls as snow, forming firm snow cover. The last wet snow precipitation may be in the beginning of May, and it may restart at the end of September.
Snow cover.
Snow cover (averaging 3–5 months per year) is formed at the beginning of November and melts in beginning of April, but in recent years snow cover has lasted shorter than usual. For example, in the winter of 2006–2007 the snow cover didn't form until the end of January, and melted at the beginning of March; in 2007–2008, the snow cover melted at the end of February, and in the 2008–2009 winter, snow cover didn't form until the end of December, which is one month later than usual. Yet in 2011-2012 it melted in the middle of April.
Wind.
Speed of wind.
The average wind speed is not high. In the city it is near 2 metres per second; in open places and airports it may top 6 metres per second.
Wind Storms and Tornadoes.
A few times per season, often in the May–September period during thunderstorms, wind speed may exceed 15–35 metres per second. The last powerful wind storm was in 1998, when wind speed was 30–35 metres per second. 157 persons were injured, 8 died, and 2157 buildings were damaged.
Tornadoes were recorded in 1904 and 1945 in Moscow and in 1970, 1971, the 1984 Yaroslavl tornado, 1987, 1994, and 1997 in Moscow Oblast 100 km south-east from Moscow (near Zaraysk), in 2005 in Dubna, and on 3 August 2007 in Krasnogorsk.
In the 3 June 2009 tornado, F3 registered near Sergiyev Posad, Moscow oblast.
Сloudiness and day light.
Number of clear, cloudy and overcast days.
On average Moscow has 1731 hours of sunshine in a year. In 2004–2008, near 1800–2000 hours.

Top-left lighting

Top-left lighting is an artistic convention in which illustrations are produced so that the light appears to come from the top left of the picture.
Most people prefer lighting from the left when resolving a convex-concave ambiguity, and this preference may be stronger for right-handed people. This is reflected in Roman mosaics and in Renaissance, baroque and impressionist art.
In cartography, the predominant custom of placing the shadow on the right-hand side of hill profiles was established during the 15th century. Computer interfaces tend to use top left lighting as well, although this trend has gradually shifted more towards light coming straight from the top.
There are notable exceptions to this convention, such as Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus.

Tony Villars

Anthony Keith "Tony" Villars (born 24 January 1952 in Pontypool) is a Welsh former international footballer.
Career.
Tony Villars was a member of the youth set-up and groundstaff at Newport County but quit the job because the pay was so poor. Moving into the Welsh league he signed for Pontnewydd. His time at the club was short after the entire team was signed by Panteg after a number of impressive performances. He continued his climb up the ladder by moving to Cwmbran Town. It was here that he was spotted by Cardiff City who offered him a professional contract.
Villars soon established himself in the first team, makiing his debut in a 4-3 defeat to Fulham in November 1971. Often an inconsistent player, Villars also scored several crucial goals for the club, including one against Crytsal Palace to keep Cardiff in Division Two. It was during his time at Cardiff that Villars earned all of his three caps for Wales. Persistent injury problems meant that he lost his place in the side and he moved to Newport County in June 1976.
He failed to reproduce the form he showed in his days at Cardiff and just under two years into his spell at the club his contract was cancelled. Incredibly just two and a half years after winning his three caps for Wales, Villars left league football never to return at the age of just 25.

PoliticsPA

PoliticsPA.com is a website centered on the politics of Pennsylvania.
Content.
The website reports on political and campaign news in Pennsylvania, from the state legislature up to federal races. The editors write occasional features, like the weekly "Up & Down" scorecard and one-off lists like "Harrisburg's Smartest Staffers" and "Best Dressed Lobbyist" lists. In addition, PoliticsPa.com accepts anonymous tips; In 2012, it was the first news source to report that Tom Smith would challenge Bob Casey in the United States Senate race, as well as the fact that Governor Tom Corbett had endorsed Steve Welch in the contest. In 2004, it was the first news source to report in 2004 that Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter would face Pat Toomey in the Republican primary and that Joe Hoeffel would seek the Democratic nomination that year. On occasion, the website hosts original documents including political television and radio ads, campaign fliers, and controversial letters.
The editors of the website operate under the pseudonym "Sy Snyder," a nod to the former Pennsylvania Governor Simon Snyder Terry Madonna, professor at Franklin and Marshall College, said in 2003 that the level of expertise demonstrated on the site implies that "Sy Snyder" must be a reporter, a politician or a consultant. Specific speculation ranges from political reporters Pete DeCoursey and Charlie Thompson to former State Representative and convicted felon Tom Druce.
Influence.
By 2003, the site had become a popular fixture among political junkies and insiders, focusing on detailed political minutiae and "scuttlebutt." In spite of the small size of this audience, PoliticsPA.com became one of the "most influential forces in state political circles." Observers have compared it to the "Drudge Report" and subscription-based news sites the "National Journal's" The Hotline and Capitolwire.
The website grew from 11,000 hits per month at its launch on October 22, 2001 to almost 40,000 hits per month in April 2004. In the run up to the 2012 primary, it received over 150,000 hits per month.
"The Columbia Journalism Review" described PoliticsPA after the 2012 U.S. election as a news source that has "managed to break traditional journalistic boundaries and maintain a high level of quality, authority, and urgency." "The Washington Post" blog "The Fix" also named the website as the best Pennsylvania political blog in 2011.
History.
PoliticsPA was founded on October 22, 2001
The website was created by the Publius Group, a New Jersey-based media organization who, at the time operated five similar state-based political websites, including PoliticsNJ, PoliticsVT, and PoliticsNY. Ceisler Jubelirer, a Pennsylvania-based media relations group, including Larry Ceisler and Jeff Jubelirer, purchased the website from the Publius Group in January 2007. Ceisler Jubelirer separated in 2010 and currently share ownership of the site along with lobbyist David Urban. The current owners maintained a similar structure, including using the "Sy Snyder" pseudonym.
In 2005, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission sent PoliticsPA.com a "cease and desist" letter warning against displaying an image of the Commission's historical marker commemorating Simon Snyder, which was protected as a federal trademark. State Representative Mike Veon successfully lobbied the Commission to relax its image policy, allowing use in "legitimate promotion."

Hunter Hereford Ranch Historic District

The Hunter Hereford Ranch was first homesteaded in 1909 by James Williams in the eastern portion of Jackson Hole, in what would become Grand Teton National Park. By the 1940s it was developed as a hobby ranch by William and Eileen Hunter and their foreman John Anderson. With its rustic log buildings it was used as the shooting location for the movie "The Wild Country", while one structure with a stone fireplace was used in the 1963 movie "Spencer's Mountain". The ranch is located on the extreme eastern edge of Jackson Hole under Shadow Mountain. It is unusual in having some areas of sagebrush-free pasture.
Description.
The buildings were designed by architect Eber E. Piers of Ogden, Utah. Piers is more commonly associated with Prairie style architecture; the Hunter Ranch was his only work in a rustic style. Piers was a friend of the Hunters and was paid in room and board, vacationing at the ranch. The large ranch house and guest house, now demolished, was furnished by Thomas C. Molesworth, while the buildings were built by local carpenters, the Nelson brothers. Piers was instructed to model the barn on the Gerritt Hardeman barn near Wilson, Wyoming. The Hardeman ranch was the source of much of the Hunter stock. The Hunter barn, while clearly in keeping with local custom in its character, was constructed to a high standard compared to the more humble structures typical of Jackson Hole ranches.
Additional buildings include a chicken house, stud barn, hay shed, equipment shed and garage, all built in 1945. The foreman's residence was built in 1908 and modified in 1945. The original log homestead cabin was expanded to the east, or rear, and on the north side, with 1- or -story log structures to become the foreman's residence. The log bunkhouse was built about 1921.
The ranch was sold to the National Park Service in 1957, but grazing, water and land rights were retained by Eileen Hunter until her death in 1989. The Park Service briefly leased the lands and buildings to the nearby Triangle X Ranch, but terminated the lease in 1991 as part of a plan to return the property to its natural condition. The large Piers-designed Hunter residence and surrounding guest cabins were removed in 1992, leaving the buildings associated with the working ranch intact. A bunkhouse, barn and foremans' cabin remain. Other Piers-designed structures were moved to the Climbers' Ranch and the Teton Science School at the Ramshorn Ranch.
The property within the historic district comprises , and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

<doc id="19910512" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19910512" title="Sum frequency generation spectroscopy">
Sum frequency generation spectroscopy

Sum frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG) is a technique used to analyze surfaces and interfaces. This nonlinear laser spectroscopy method was developed in 1987 and rapidly applied to deduce the composition, orientation distributions, and some structural information of molecules at gas–solid, gas–liquid and liquid–solid interfaces. In a typical SFG setup, two laser beams mix at a surface and generate an output beam with a frequency equal to the sum of the two input frequencies. SFG has advantages in its ability to be monolayer surface sensitive, ability to be performed in situ (for example aqueous surfaces and in gases), and not causing much damage to the sample surface. SFG is comparable to second harmonic generation (SFG is a more general form) and Infrared and Raman spectroscopy.
Theory.
IR-visible sum frequency generation spectroscopy uses two laser beams that overlap at a surface of a material or the interface between two materials. An output beam is generated at a frequency of the sum of the two input beams. The two input beams have to be able to access the surface, and the output beam needs to be able to leave the surface to be picked up by a detector. One of the beams is a visible wavelength laser held at a constant frequency and the other is a tunable infrared laser. By tuning the IR laser, the system can scan over resonances and obtain the vibrational spectrum of the interfacial region.
As a nonlinear optical process, the polarization which generates the output depends on the electric fields of the two input beams. 
As a second-order nonlinear process, SFG is dependent on the 2nd order susceptibility χ(2). The fact that the 2nd order susceptibility, a third rank tensor, becomes zero in centrosymmetric media, limits what samples are accessible for SFG. Centrosymmetric media include the bulk of gases, liquids, and most solids under the assumption of the electric-dipole approximation, which neglects the signal generated by multipoles and magnetic moments. At an interface between two different materials or two centrosymmetric media, the inversion symmetry is broken and an SFG signal can be generated. This suggests that the resulting spectra represent a thin layer of molecules. A signal is found when there is a net polar orientation.
SFG intensity.
The output beam is collected by a detector and its intensity is measured. The intensity of the beam is given by
Here, intensity is directly proportional to the susceptibility squared and the product of the intensities of the incoming beams. The IR frequency is given as ω2 and the visible frequency is given as ω1. The constant of proportionality varies across literature, many of them including the product of the square of the output frequency, ω2 and the squared secant of the reflection angle, sec2β. Other factors include index of refractions for the three beams.
The second order susceptibility has two contributions 
where χnr is the non-resonating contribution and χr is the resonating contribution. The non-resonating contribution is assumed to be from electronic responses. Although this contribution has often been considered to be constant over the spectrum, because it is generated simultaneously with the resonant response, the two responses must compete for intensity. This competition shapes the nonresonant contribution in the presence of resonant features by resonant attenuation. Because it is not currently known how to adequately correct for nonresonant interferences, it is very important to experimentally isolate the resonant contributions from any nonresonant interference, often done using the technique of nonresonant suppression. 
The resonating contribution is from the vibrational modes and shows changes in resonance. It can be expressed as a sum of a series of Lorentz oscillators 
where A is the strength or amplitude, ω is the frequency or energy, Γ is the damping or linewidth coefficient, and each q is a resonance mode. The amplitude is a product of μ, the induced dipole moment, and α, the polarizability. Together, this indicates that the transition must be both IR and Raman active.
The above equations can be combined to form
which used to model the SFG output over a range of wavenumbers. When the SFG system scans over a vibrational mode of the surface molecule, the output intensity is resonantly enhanced. In a graphical analysis of the output intensity versus wave number, this is represented by peaks. Depending on the system, inhomogeneous broadening and interference between peaks may occur. The Lorentz profile can be convoluted with a Gaussian intensity distribution to better fit the intensity distribution. 
Orientation information.
From the second order susceptibility, it is possible to ascertain information about the orientation of molecules at the surface. χ(2) describes how the molecules at the interface respond to the input beam. A change in the net orientation of the polar molecules results in a change of sign of χ(2). As a rank 3 tensor, the individual elements provide information about the orientation. For a surface that has azimuthal symmetry, only four of the twenty seven tensor elements are nonzero:
The tensor elements can be determined by using two different polarizers, one for the electric field vector perpendicular to the plane of incidence, labeled S, and one for the electric field vector parallel to the plane of incidence, labeled P. Four combinations are sufficient: PPP, SSP, SPS, PSS, with the letters listed in decreasing frequency, so the first is for the sum frequency, the second is for the visible beam, and the last is for the infrared beam. The four combinations give rise to four different intensities:
where indice i is of the interfacial xy-plane, and f and f’ are the linear and nonlinear Fresnel factors. 
By taking the tensor elements and applying the correct transformations, the orientation of the molecules on the surface can be found.
Experimental setup.
Since SFG is a higher order function, one of the main concerns in the experimental setup is being able to generate a signal strong enough to detect, with discernible peaks and narrow bandwidths. Pico-second and femto-second pulse width lasers are used due to being pulsed lasers with high peak fields. are commonly used. However, the bandwidth is increased with shorter pulses, forming a tradeoff for desired properties. 
Another limitation is the tunable range of the IR laser. This has been augmented by optical parametric generation (OPG), optical parametric oscillation (OPO), and optical parametric amplification (OPA) systems.
Signal strength can be improved by using special geometries, such as a total internal reflection setup which uses a prism to change the angles so they are close to the critical angles, allowing the SFG signal to be generated at its critical angle, enhancing the signal. 
Common detector setups utilize a monochromator and a photomultiplier for filtering and detecting.

Scrooge (1935 film)

Scrooge is a 1935 British fantasy film directed by Henry Edwards and starring Seymour Hicks, Donald Calthrop and Robert Cochran. Hicks appears as Ebenezer Scrooge, the miser who hates Christmas. It was the first sound version of the Charles Dickens classic "A Christmas Carol", not counting a 1928 short subject that now appears to be lost. Hicks had previously played the role of Scrooge on the stage many times beginning in 1901, and again in a 1913 British silent film version.
Film.
The 1935 film differs from all other versions of the story in one significant way – most of the ghosts, including that of Jacob Marley, are not actually shown onscreen, although their voices are heard. Only the Ghost of Christmas Present (Oscar Asche) is actually seen in full figure – the Ghost of Christmas Past is a mere shape with no discernible facial features, Marley's Ghost is seen only briefly as a face on the door knocker, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is just an outstretched pointing finger.
Seymour Hicks plays both the old and young Scrooge. Albert Finney (in the 1970 film Scrooge) is the only other actor to play both young and old Scrooge in film.
The story is also severely truncated. Much time is spent at the beginning of the film – before any of the ghosts appear – setting up the atmosphere of rich and poor London. Scrooge's sister Fan and Fezziwig are completely omitted from this version.
This is the first of only two sound versions in which Tiny Tim is actually seen lying dead. In the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come sequence Bob Cratchit grieves at Tim's bedside. The 1999 Patrick Stewart version also contains this scene.
Maurice Evans appears briefly as a man harassed by Scrooge to pay his debts. Donald Calthrop portrays a Bob Cratchit who bears an uncanny physical resemblance to John Leech's illustrations of the character in the original 1843 edition of the novel.
Two versions of this film exist; each has a differently designed opening credits sequence, and one of the two versions omits the very last scenes.
Also, copyright for this film was never renewed and therefore it is in the public domain and can be shown on multiple stations in a market. For years it was kept out of circulation, due to the extremely poor quality of most of the surviving prints.

Myakinino (Moscow Metro)

Myakinino () is a Moscow Metro station in Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast. It is on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line, between Volokolamskaya and Strogino stations. 
Myakinino opened on 26 December 2009. It is the first station to be built outside Moscow, in the town of Krasnogorsk. It is a ground station, located near the Moscow Oblast Administrative HQ and the Crocus City Mall.
The construction of the tunnel from Strogino station (previously the terminus of the line) to Myakinino started in summer 2008.
History.
The station was named after the former village of Myakinino, which is currently inside the administrative territory of Moscow City, inside Kuntsevo District, Western Administrative Okrug. The name was approved by the government of Moscow basing on the suggestion by City commission on territorial units, streets and Metro stations.
The first plan of Strogino-Mitino extension did not include Myakinino station. It was included in the plan after the start of Strogino-Mitino line construction and the decision to unite the Krylatskoye-Mitino section with Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line.
At first it was planned that Myakinino would be a shallow single-span station with island platform (according to the slightly modified plan of the now-cancelled Yugo-Zapadnaya station of Solntsevskaya Line) and would be situated near the new House of Government of Moscow Oblast and trade centre Crocus Expo.

Dead Confederate

Dead Confederate is an American alternative rock band formed in Augusta, Georgia and based in Athens, Georgia. The band's sound has been described as a mix of alternative country, psychedelic rock and grunge, and has drawn comparisons to Nirvana and My Morning Jacket.
History.
Childhood friends Thomas Hardy Morris and Walker Howle have played together since high school in Augusta, Georgia and along with Morris's brother Dawson hooked up with Jason Scarboro and Brantley Senn to form Redbelly in college in 1997. 
Redbelly's original lead singer Dawson Morris left and the band eventually went on to release its self-titled debut in October 2003 (recorded in Augusta in December 2002). At this point the band was primarily a southern rock-influenced jam band whose songs would often be 20 or 30 minutes long and were styled between Neil Young and Pink Floyd. Drummer Jason Scarboro later commented that the band had had its "share of playing 20- and 30-minute songs and really, it sucked--It's something that gets really old"; Senn also commented that "We knew we were making music that didn’t match the music we were into. We were going nowhere".
A turning point for the band came when the members relocated to Atlanta, where John Watkins joined them and they renamed themselves The Redbelly Band. The Redbelly Band released an EP entitled "Underbelly" in 2004 and what would become the Redbelly Band's last album, "Petition To The Queen" (recorded at Transduction Studios in Athens) in 2006.) The album featured the first version of the Senn-penned track The Rat, which was intentionally tighter than the band's previous looser, more improvised material.
In late 2006, the members relocated to Athens, where Morris and Senn attended college. Taking themselves more seriously and writing tighter, more song-based material, they renamed the band Dead Confederate. When questioned about the new name, frontman Morris commented that it "sounded like we did; a bit dark, a bit militant, a bit southern"; Senn later commented that the Redbelly Band was "a terrible name". After beating hundreds of bands to win the Open Mic Madness battle of the bands competition in Atlanta, the band was given the prize of two days' free recording at the city's Nickel and Dime Studios, where they produced a four-song demo.
In 2007, former Capitol Records president Gary Gersh, who had previously signed Sonic Youth and Nirvana to Geffen Records signed Dead Confederate as the first band on his new label TAO. Radio DJ and record company scout Scott Register had seen the band play in Birmingham, Alabama and had played the band's demo to Gersh. On January 22, 2008, the band released its self-titled debut EP, which was a collection of early recordings. The new EP and an appearance at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas resulted in some national exposure. 
On September 16, 2008, the band released its first LP, "Wrecking Ball", on the TAO label. The band recorded the album earlier that year with producer Mike McCarthy in Austin.
The band toured the album nationwide, including shows with Dinosaur Jr, and in Europe with A Place To Bury Strangers and J Mascis.
On October 10, Dead Confederate made its first national television appearance, performing "The Rat" on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Four months later, the song spent a week at No. 39 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.
In 2009, the band signed a deal with Kartel in the UK and Europe, which saw "Wrecking Ball" released on October 26, 2009, with a selection of the tracks from the band's debut EP as bonus material.
The band released its second LP, "Sugar", in North America on October 24, 2010, and in the UK and Europe on September 13. The album was recorded with producer John Agnello in Hoboken, New Jersey, during record-setting snowfall, a factor that influenced the album's title. Morris described the album as being "more upbeat and psychedelic" than "Wrecking Ball" and revealed that the band deliberately didn't work on the arrangements for the songs until just days before entering the studio.
In the summer of 2010, the band co-headlined a US tour with Alberta Cross—the "DC/AC" tour, and also toured Europe and England in February 2011 as co-headliners with UK and Europe label mates The Whigs.
In a February 2011 interview, Senn stated that the band was working on EP of b-sides from the "Sugar" album sessions, however this was never released.
Following a number of live dates with different drummers, the band announced in August 2011 that found member, drummer Jason Scarboro had left the band to "start a family". The band set to work on their third studio album in early 2012 with Andy LeMaster and Drive-By Truckers producer David Barbe at Chase Park Transduction in Athens. The album "In The Marrow" was released in April 2013 via the band's own Redeye Distribution distributed Spiderbomb Records, which according to Morriss is a "kind of a culmination of all the stuff we’ve done" and features new drummer JJ Bower and guests Thayer Sarrano and Matt Stoessel. In December 2012, the band released the EP "Peyote People" featuring tracks recorded following the album sessions digitally though their official website. The EP features guest musicians in additional to the band, and was potentially going to be released not as Dead Confederate but as Peyote People.
In down time from the band guitarist Walker Howle has concentrated on his artwork as well as headlining local shows under several names including PigMan and Tia Madre. Morris as well as playing solo gigs as T. Hardy Morris and The Outfit has formed Diamond Rugs with Deer Tick singer John McCauley and Black Lips guitarist Ian Saint Pé. In March 2013 it was announced that Morriss had signed to Dangerbird Records and is due to release his debut album Audition Tapes" in summer 2013 as T. Hardy Morris and The Outfit.

Osh riots (1990)

The Osh riots (; ; ) were an ethnic conflict between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks that took place in June 1990 in the cities of Osh and Uzgen, part of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic (Kyrgyz SSR). The immediate cause of the riots was a dispute between an Uzbek nationalist group Adolat and a Kyrgyz nationalist group Osh Aymaghi over the land of a former collective farm. While official estimates of the death toll range from over 300 to more than 600, unofficial figures range up to more than 1,000. The riots have been seen as a forerunner to the 2010 ethnic clashes in the same region.
Historical background.
Prior to the Soviet period, the inhabitants of the Osh region of the Fergana Valley referred to themselves as Kipchaks. In the 1920s, using language as the key determinant of ethnicity, Soviet ethnographers classified the lowland Kipchaks as Uzbeks and the highland Kipchaks as Kyrgyz. Although in the 1930s, Joseph Stalin divided the rich Fergana Valley among the Kyrgyz, Uzbek and Tajik SSRs, nationalities were not necessarily confined to the borders drawn for them. Along the "Kyrgyz" side of the Tentek-say River, there was a significant population of Uzbeks. Because of the region’s oil reserves, the local intelligentsia was able to obtain a significant degree of affluence, but infrastructure remained underdeveloped. During the Khrushchev era most of the deportees from the 1930s onward left to find better work elsewhere. By the late Brezhnev era, there were already signs of unemployment.
By the late 1980s, the economic situation between both Kyrgyz and Uzbek populations had markedly noticeable differences. Uzbeks, who were traditionally the merchants and farmers of the region, benefited from the market conditions of the Gorbachev Era; Uzbeks also made up the largest number of workers in the most profitable industries, such as commerce and transportation. Perestroika had the opposite effect on the much larger Kyrgyz population. As collectives were disassembled and unemployment in the region grew, the Kyrgyz, who traditionally practiced animal husbandry, felt the brunt of the rising economic downturns—there was a housing deficiency and an unemployment rate of 22.8%. In addition to economic discrepancies, the ethnic ratios of the region's administrative posts did not respond to the demographics of the population. In 1990, the Uzbeks made up 26% of the region’s population with the Kyrgyz at 60%, but only 4% of the key official posts were held by Uzbeks.
In the late 1980s, several inter-ethnic disputes had already plagued the Fergana region. Around June 1989 in the neighboring Uzbek SSR, ethnic Uzbeks launched a series of pogroms against Meskhetian Turks, the cause of which was believed to have been rooted in the existing economic disparities between the two ethnicities. Similarly, in the Tajik SSR, there were clashes between local Tajiks and Armenians who had recently been deported from Nagorno Karabach. In the Kyrgyz SSR, ethnic tensions began to simmer in the spring of 1990 when Adolat (Uzbek for "justice"), an Uzbek nationalist group that claimed a membership of over 40,000, began to petition the Osh government for greater representation and the freedom for Uzbek language schooling, publications, and culture. At the same time, Osh Aymaghi, a Kyrgyz nationalist group, was petitioning for its own demands, the foremost of which was the redistribution of land belonging to Lenin Kolkhoz, a mostly Uzbek collective farm. The group was on the verge of seizing the land on its own when authorities finally agreed to redistribute some of the land, but their final decision to reallocate a large portion of Uzbek land to the Kyrgyz denomination with little compensation for the original inhabitants pleased neither party. Uzbek and Kyrgyz demonstrators gathered around the collective farm to protest the party’s decision.
Riots.
The violence began on 4 June in the city of Osh after large groups of Kyrgyz and Uzbeks gathered in the territory of Lenin Kolkhoz. The riots started to spread to some other areas of Osh Province on that same day. In the city of Uzgen violence started the next day. The immediate cause of the riots in Uzgen was a dispute between the Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in the area of Uzgen bazaar and bus station.
During the riots some of the local militsiyas (the local Soviet police force) expressed loyalties to their own ethnic counterparts by taking part in the riots. Although supplies and vehicles used in the attacks were predominantly stolen by the young rioters, some local Kyrgyz elites who did not openly take part in the violence lent supplies and vehicles to the demonstrators.
The worst of the large-scale clashes occurred in the cities of Osh and Uzgen. The violence was not just confined to urban zones; in the villages surrounding Uzgen and the Osh countryside, Kyrgyz herders, often going by horseback, terrorized Uzbek farmers with rape, murder, and property destruction. In the foothills of Baka Archa, four Kyrgyz shepherds rode many miles to kill an Uzbek beekeeper. Uzbek tea houses ("choyxonas") were also targeted, and several reports involve the abduction and rape of female tea house-goers.
In Frunze (now Bishkek), protesters demanded that the leaders of the Kyrgyz SSR resign. On 6 June, Gorbachev finally called in the Red Army under the Soviet Ministry of Interior to enter the area of the conflict and stay stationed only within cities. The Uzbek-Kyrgyz border was sealed off to prevent Uzbeks from the neighboring Uzbek SSR from joining the riots.
Official estimates of the death toll range from over 300 to more than 600. Unofficial figures range up to more than 1,000. According to unofficial estimates, more than 5,000 crimes were committed during the riots ranging from pillaging to murder. About 4,000 incidents were officially investigated and 3,215 acts of crime were registered. According to witnesses and personal testimonies, most of the rioters were young males, 29% of which were teenagers. Personal testimonies from victims, witness and participants revealed chemical intoxication was a significant influence on the rioters' actions.
Aftermath.
The Osh riots were the only ethnic conflict from the former Soviet Union to undergo a court-led investigation. In the 1991 trials conducted by the new independent Kyrgyz government, 46 of the 48 participants were found guilty, with sentences ranging from 18 years in a maximum security prison to suspended sentences. Most of the defendants were Kyrgyz. This contrasted with the Osh riots of 2010, in which those arrested and sentenced were mainly ethnic Uzbeks.
With the 1991 independence of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbeks were not ensured much autonomy in the new government of Akayev and were held with deep suspicion by the general populace. In the mid-1990s Uzbeks occupied only 4.7% of the Osh regional posts. The economic depression following independence only heightened ethnic tensions in the following years. When law enforcement broke down in 2010, these hidden tensions were uncontrollable. That is one of the many reasons why speculators believe that the riots in 2010 were not just merely a repeat of those of 20 years before, but a continuation of the conflict.

French ironclad Bayard

The Bayard was an early stationary battleship of the French Navy, lead ship of her class. "Bayard" had a wooden hull and a full rigging, as well as a side armour and steam machinery.
Active service.
"Bayard" was commissioned in May 1883 under the command of "capitaine de vaisseau" Parrayon as the flagship of Admiral Amédée Courbet, who had recently been appointed to the command of France's Trial division ("division des essais"), established in April 1883. On 31 May 1883, in the wake of the defeat and death of Commandant Henri Rivière in Tonkin (northern Vietnam) at the Battle of Paper Bridge, Courbet was placed in command of a newly created Tonkin Coasts naval division. In early June Courbet left for the Far East with the ironclads "Bayard" and "Atalante" and the cruiser "Châteaurenault".
"Bayard" arrived in Along Bay on 10 July, and for the next eleven months served as flagship of the Tonkin Coasts naval division. In August 1883, in the Battle of Thuan An, she bombarded the coastal defences of Hué, receiving minor shot damage from the Vietnamese shore batteries. From October 1883 to June 1884, during the period of growing tension that preceded the outbreak of the Sino-French War (August 1884–April 1885), she took part in a French naval blockade of the coast of Tonkin. On 30 November 1883, in response to the threat of an imminent Vietnamese attack on the French post at Quang Yen, "Bayard"'s landing company was hastily installed in the town's citadel, successfully deterring the threatened attack. In June 1884 "Bayard" became the flagship of the Far East Squadron, an exceptional naval grouping created for the war with China by the amalgamation of the Tonkin Coasts and Far East naval divisions.
On 5 August 1884 sailors from "Bayard" took part in a French landing at Keelung, but were forced to re-embark on 6 August by a heavy Chinese counterattack. "Bayard" took no part in the Battle of Fuzhou (23 August 1884), the opening battle of the Sino-French War, as she drew too much water to enter the Min River. Instead, she was left to guard the telegraph station at Sharp Peak near Matsu that allowed the squadron to communicate with France. On 1 October 1884 "Bayard" and several other French warships supported the French landing at Keelung with a naval bombardment of Chinese shore positions. On 8 October "Bayard"'s landing company took part in the failed French landing at Tamsui, which condemned the Formosa expeditionary corps to a prolonged Keelung Campaign. From November 1884 to January 1885 "Bayard" took part in the French naval blockade of Formosa (Taiwan). On 14 November 1884, while anchored off Keelung and exposed to the northeast monsoon, she nearly foundered when her anchor chain snapped during a gale.
In February 1885 five warships of China's Nanyang Fleet made a sortie from Shanghai in an attempt to break the French blockade of Formosa. Courbet sought them out with "Bayard" and several other ships of the Far East squadron, and trapped them in Shipu Bay. At the Battle of Shipu on the night of 14 February 1885, two of "Bayard"'s launches, used as improvised torpedo boats, attacked the Chinese squadron at anchor and disabled the frigate "Yuyuan" (馭遠) and the composite sloop "Chengqing" (澄慶). In early March 1885 "Bayard" took part in the French blockade of Zhenhai, the outport of Ningbo. In late March she formed part of the French flotilla for the Pescadores Campaign, and her landing company was engaged ashore on 31 March in the decisive battle with the Chinese defenders of Makung.
Admiral Amédée Courbet died on board "Bayard" in the harbour of Makung, in the Pescadores Islands, on 11 June 1885. "Bayard" left the Pescadores on 23 June to return Courbet's body to France for a state funeral, arriving at Toulon on 26 August. She then proceeded to Brest to be disarmed and decommissioned.
She was eventually used as a hulk from 1899.

Structure.
John Szwed notes that in "Black Bottom Stomp," "Morton practiced what he preached, managing to incorporate in one short piece the 'Spanish tinge,' stomps, breaks, stoptime, backbeat, two-beat, four-beat, a complete suspension of the rhythm section during the piano solo, riffs, rich variations of melody, and dynamics of volume, all of the elements of jazz as he understood it."
The harmonic basis is relatively simple, using standard II - V - I progressions. During the A section chorus, the chord progression passes through the relative minor.
With only seven instruments in the ensemble, Morton produces five distinct textures:
