Chancery Regulation Act 1862

The Chancery Regulation Act 1862 (25 & 26 Vict., c. 42), also known as Rolt's Act was an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament that was an important step in the fusion of law and equity.
Background.
From the 13th century in England and Wales, equity developed as a system of justice in parallel with and complementary to the common law. By the 19th century, with the rise of capitalism in Victorian Britain, equity had become very important. The remedies available to the common law were limited to damages and those disputes demanding an injunction or specific performance of a contract needed to be heard in equity which was administered in Courts of Chancery, separate from the common law courts. Moreover, procedure in equity was better able to handle complex disputes involving the relationship between several parties such as partnerships and trusts.
However, the dual jurisdiction of law and equity caused problems for litigants. In equity, all parties had to be represented at all hearings and if one died or married complex procedures were needed to maintain the action. The rate of progress of the action was in the hands of the parties and would tend to be determined by the slowest. Many uncontroversial administrative actions, such as appointing a new trustee, were dealt with as though they were contentious, adding further delay. There were many inefficiencies in procedure with high costs and a certain amount of corruption. Further, cases that involved questions of both law and equity would be hampered, shuttling between the courts of Chancery and common law courts for years, as in "Wood v. Scarth".
The Chancery commission (1824–26) made recommendations on streamlining procedure but the commissioners concluded that the Chancery courts themselves had the powers to improve matters. Over the following decades there was much debate leading to legislation including the Improvement of the Jurisdiction of Equity Act 1852 which allowed Chancery judges to decide questions of fact rather than remitting them to the common law courts. However, by 1862, Chancery judges were still reluctant to make use of these powers so Attorney General Sir John Rolt introduced a bill to make determination of facts by Chancery judges mandatory.
The Act.
In the end, the Act was weakened from its initial intentions, allowing matters of fact to be decided by the assizes.
The Act applied to the High Court of Chancery of England and Wales and also to the Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Lancaster which had an independent jurisdiction in equity. A further Act brought a similar reform to Ireland.
Subsequent developments.
The fusion of law and equity was finally effected in the 1870s by the Judicature Acts.

Leo Rosner

Leopold "Leo" Rosner (June 26, 1918 – October 10, 2008) was a Polish-born Australian Jewish musician. Rosner survived the Holocaust in concentration camps during World War II by playing his accordion for Nazi guards and officials, earning the attention of Oskar Schindler who likely saved his life. His survival story became known after Australian author Thomas Kenneally's 1982 novel, "Schindler's Ark", was adapted into Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning film, "Schindler's List". He appeared in the epilogue of the film at the Schindler memorial in Yad Vashem, Israel.
Early life.
Rosner was born in Krakow, Poland, in 1918. He was one of nine children within a family that performed in the music business.
Schindler's List.
Rosner was a successful cabaret artist and entertainer in Poland by the time Hitler launched his blitzkrieg and occupied the country in 1939. He and his wife, Helen Rosner, were deported separately to the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp in 1943. While at Plaszow, Rosner was forced to perform his accordion for commandant Amon Goeth.
Rosner's talent with his accordion earned him the attention of Oskar Schindler. Schindler personally had Rosner moved to an enamelling factory in Brinnlitz, Czechoslovakia, in 1945. However, Rosner's wife, Helen, was transferred to the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp. Rosner was able to successfully persuade Schindler to have Helen Rosner removed from Auschwitz. The couple were reunited in Brinnlitz, where they remained until the end of World War II.
Post World War II.
Leo and Helen Rosner immigrated to Australia in 1949 and settled in Melbourne. He worked as a musician and eventually fronted a twelve piece band. He continued to perform into his eighties. He was well known in the Melbourne musician business as well as in the Australian Holocaust survivors community.
The couple had two daughters in Australia, Anna and Frances.
Rosner suffered from Alzheimer's disease during his later years, but was able to perform at his and Helen's 65th wedding anniversary celebration in 2008.
Death.
Leo Rosner died on October 10, 2008, at the age of 90 of complications from Alzheimer's disease in Melbourne, Australia. He was survived by his wife, Helen Rosner, who was 84 years old at the time of Leo's death. Rosner was also survived by his daughters, six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
His funeral was held at Chevra Kadisha in Springvale, Victoria.
His wife died in 2010.

Collinsonia

Collinsonia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. It is endemic to eastern North America. It was named for the English botanist Peter Collinson (1694–1768) by Linnaeus in Species Plantarum in 1753. It is in the tribe Elsholtzieae, a small tribe of only 5 genera. In order of their number of species, they are "Elsholtzia", "Mosla", "Collinsonia", "Perilla", and "Perillula".
The circumscription of species in "Collinsonia" has been a source of confusion, and many names have been published. Some authors have recognized as many as 10 species. In 2006, the genus was revised with only four species recognized.

The Colóns

The Colóns was a professional wrestling tag team that consisted of real-life brothers, Carlito and Primo. The team worked for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). They were the first-ever Unified WWE Tag Team Champions, being holders of both the WWE Tag Team Championship and World Tag Team Championship.
Their father is former World Wrestling Federation wrestler Carlos Colón, Sr., and they initially began teaming together in his promotion, World Wrestling Council and held the WWC World Tag Team Championship. In 2008, they began teaming together in WWE, when Primo debuted on "SmackDown" alongside his brother, already a WWE Superstar. In their debut as a tag team within the promotion, they defeated then-WWE Tag Team Champions Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder. This win earned them a title opportunity two weeks later, in which they were also successful. At WrestleMania XXV they became the first team to unify both tag team title sets by defeating John Morrison and The Miz.
History.
World Wrestling Council.
The Colóns initially began teaming in their father's company, World Wrestling Council (WWC) to defeat the tag team of Thunder and Lightning for the WWC World Tag Team Championship on March 16, 2002. They lost the title to Thunder and Lightning on the very next night. At Lockout 2009, the brothers performed in the promotion for the first time since teaming in WWE. Although they were not booked in a match, The Colóns hosted a segment of Carlito's Cabana with David Sierra as the invited guest. In this segment, the promotion tried to explain why Eddie was renamed to "Primo", claiming that he wanted to preserve Eddie Guerrero's legacy by not using his actual name. On May 20, 2009, The Colóns issued an open challenge to any tag team for Aniversario 2009, the promotion's anniversary event.
Formation (2008–2009).
Soon after Primo debuted in WWE, he became a full time member of the SmackDown! roster, along with his brother. They defeated WWE Tag Team Champions Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder in their first match as a team to gain victory on September 12, 2008. Two weeks later, both teams competed in a title match, with The Colóns winning to become tag team champions.
Starting in November, The Colóns developed an on-screen relationship with The Bella Twins (Nikki and Brie), appearing in numerous backstage segments with them and The Bellas accompanied them to the ring. This relationship with the Bella Twins subsequently led to a feud with the World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz, as Morrison and The Miz flirted with The Bella Twins, and then defeated Carlito and Primo to win a date with them on Valentine's Day. The Bella were seemingly unable to choose between the teams, leading to Morrison and The Miz challenging The Colóns for the WWE Tag Team Championship, and The Colóns challenging Morrison and The Miz for the World Tag Team Championship, although each team retained their respective championship. The rivalry between the teams led The Bella Twins to fall out with each other, with Brie siding with the Colóns, and Nikki siding with Morrison and The Miz. At WrestleMania XXV, The Colóns defeated Morrison and The Miz to win the World Tag Team Championship and become the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions, and they successfully defended the championships the following night on "Raw".
On April 15, the Colóns were drafted back to the Raw brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. On April 27, the Colóns made their debut on "Raw", defeating Jamie Noble and Chavo Guerrero. The team's collective "WWE Superstars" debut took place on May 28, 2009, when they defeated The World's Greatest Tag Team by pinfall. They lost the championship at The Bash to the team of Edge and Chris Jericho, who were added to a standard tag team match between the Colóns and The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) moments before the match started. Carlito and Primo invoked their rematch clause the next night on "Raw", but were unsuccessful, and on the July 6 episode of "Raw", they lost again to Jericho and Edge. One week later the team officially disbanded in WWE when Carlito attacked Primo. Two weeks later, Primo pinned Carlito in a 6-man tag match.
Brief reformation (2010).
The team reunited on the May 6 episode of "WWE Superstars" when Carlito stopped the match and offered Primo to reform as a team. Primo accepted the offer, thus, turning him heel. The brothers attacked R-Truth on the May 10th episode of Raw. The duo then shook hands with Ted DiBiase, Jr. after getting paid with DiBiase's "Trust Fund." The reunion of the team would be short lived, as on May 21, Carlito was released due to a violation of the WWE wellness program and subsequent refusal to attend a rehabilitation facility. While Primo went on to form Primo & Epico with their cousin Epico.

Wildlife of Canada

Canada lies within the fifteen terrestrial and five marine ecozones. The largest marine ecozone is the Arctic Archipelago whereas the terrestrial ecozone is the Boreal Shield. The main biomes of Canada are Tundra, Boreal forest, Mixed forest, broadleaf forest, Prairies, Rocky Mountains, and Temperate coniferous forests which hosts significant biodiversity.
In recent decades, human encroachment has posed a threat to Canada's wildlife; in response National Wildlife Areas (NWAs) are set aside under the Canada Wildlife Act. There are National Parks, National Wildlife Areas, as well as Migratory Bird Sanctuaries. National parks protect natural regions in Canada. NWAs conserve habitats for species at risk. Migratory bird sanctuaries protect the breeding grounds of migratory birds during the nesting season.
Fauna.
The fauna of Canada can be grouped into mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and insects. Canada is known for its mammals such as american bison, arctic hare, badger, beaver, black bear, bobcat, Little brown bat, Canada Lynx, reindeer (caribou), coyote, grizzly bears, Gray Wolf, red fox, lemming, meadow mice, moose, mountain lion, mule deer, musk ox, muskrat, polar bear, porcupine, prairie dog, pronghorn, raccoon, pinniped (seal), skunk, snowshoe hare, walrus, wapiti, weasel, whale, white tailed deer, wolverine. To name a few of the birds identified with Canada would be the American Robin, Bicknell's Thrush, Black-capped Chickadee, Blue Jay, Burrowing Owl, Canada Goose, Canvasback, Downy Woodpecker, Gray Jay, Great Blue Heron, Great Horned Owl, Greater Snow Goose, Killdeer, Loons, Piping Plover, Purple Martin, Ruby-throated Hummingbird, Sharp-shinned Hawk, Cooper's Hawk, and Whooping Crane. The biology survey of Canada cites that there are approximately 55,000 species of insects, and 11,000 species of mites and spiders.
Conservation.
Large and charismatic mammals are important for wildlife tourism in Canada and several national parks and wildlife sanctuaries cater to these needs. The Banff Wildlife Crossings Project was undertaken to preserve wildlife crossing the Trans-Canada Highway in British Columbia providing underpasses and overpasses to wildlife along the route.
Recent extinctions.
The exploitation of land and forest resources by humans along with hunting and trapping for food and sport has led to the extinction of many species in Canada in recent times. Woodland caribou, present in several provinces, are threatened by hunting, wolf predation, as well as habitat disturbance from forestry activities, roads, mining and exploration, pipelines and oil and gas production. The Newfoundland population of marten is threatened by habitat loss, accidental trapping and prey availability.
Flora of Canada.
According to environment Canada the nation of Canada hosts approximately 17,000 identified species of trees, flowers, herbs, ferns, mosses and other flora. Some trees native to Canada are Black Spruce, White Spruce, Balsam Fir, Larch (Tamarack), Lodgepole Pine, Jack Pine, Trembling & Large-Toothed Aspen, Cottonwood and White Birch, and Balsam Poplar.
National flora and fauna symbols of Canada.
The beaver's emblematic status originated from the fact much of Canada's early economic history was tied to the fur trade in beaver fur, which was used to make Euroopean fashionable hats. Another reason for the beaver's status in Canadian heraldry is that the beaver represents the symbol of industry. The Beaver was adopted as the national emblem in 1975.
The Canadian Horse was declared an official Canadian symbol in 1909 and commonly appears in images with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
The Maple leaf and maple tree is the national flora symbol of Canada. The leaf was declared approximately 1860 and the maple tree 1996.

Free Republic of Wendland

The Free Republic of Wendland (from German "Republik Freies Wendland") was a protest camp established in Gorleben, Germany, on 3 May 1980 to protest against the establishment of a nuclear waste dump there. On 4 June 1980, the police moved in and evicted the camp.
History.
Background.
The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt conducted drilling in Gorleben in 1979 in order to test the salt domes there for suitability in storing radioactive waste. After small occupations by local activists at drill sites 1002 and 1003 failed, a plan was set in motion for a bigger occupation action that would include international anti-nuclear activists. A new demonstration was called for on 3 May 1980, under the motto "Day of action for the Wends" ("Kampftag der Wenden").
Occupation.
Around 5000 anti-nuclear activists moved to the planned area around drilling site 1004, between the villages of Gorleben and Trebel. There they occupied the area as part of a protest against further drilling for the purpose of storing nuclear waste. During the occupation, the so-called "Underground Office of Gorleben-Shall-Live" ("Untergrundamt Gorleben-Soll-leben") declared the occupied area as an independent nation, naming it the Free Republic of Wendland ("Republik Freies Wendland"). The Lower-Saxon Minister of the Interior Egbert Möcklinghoff declared this proclamation to be high treason.
The site was created on an area of sandy soil and burned trees that was destroyed during the Fire on the Lüneburg Heath in 1975. On this location, the protesters built over the course of several days a village of around 110 huts, made from wood and clay, which was a typical style of protest for anti-nuclear activists at the time. Among the buildings were numerous community facilities, such as the 100-person-capacity Friendship House, greenhouses, an infirmary, a hairdressing salon and an area for waste disposal. There was also a sauna and bathing facilities. Water was piped in by a wind-powered well and warmed with solar power. 
On the approach to the "republic", a border checkpoint with a boom barrier was built, over which the flags of the Wends and of the Anti-Nuclear-Sun were hoisted. In the nearby information center, a "Wends Passport" ("Wendenpass") could be issued, along with an entry stamp, for 10 Deutsche Marks. In the words of the occupiers, the passport was good "for the entire universe [...] so long as its owner could still laugh."
Community life.
The roughly 1000 permanent occupiers organized community life during the 33-day occupation around a model of grassroots democracy. They established a spokespersons council and made decisions in regularly occurring mass meetings. Regarding their possible eviction by police, the widespread consensus was that of passive resistance, though a few militant occupiers spoke against this course. On the weekends, several thousand sympathizers and sightseers came to the occupied site, among them prominent people, such as the former head of the "Young Socialists", Gerhard Schröder. Other well-known visitors and residents included the resistance fighter Heinz Brandt, the musicians Walter Mossmann and Wolf Biermann, the photographer Günter Zint and the SPD politician Jo Leinen, as well as the writer Klaus Schlesinger. The group decision-making process took place both in the Friendship House as well as at other equally suitable platforms. These places also hosted lectures, discussions, readings, rock concerts, and puppet shows. Residents of the surrounding region supported the occupation with food and timber. On 18 May 1980 Radio Free Wendland began a pirate radio broadcast from a tower at the occupation site.
Eviction.
On the morning of 4 June 1980 the occupation site was cleared by the Lower Saxony police and the Federal Border Guard on the order of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Around 3500 officers took part in the operation, according to the Lower Saxony Ministry of the Interior and of Sports. Legal grounds for the eviction of the occupiers were based on violations of various laws, including forestry laws, building regulations, the Field and Forest Planning Act, and the Registration Act. By the time of the eviction, around 2000 occupiers had gather in the village's central square for a sit-in style protest. The eviction, during which many of the squatters were carried away by police officers, went largely peacefully. The pirate radio broadcast "Radio Free Wendland" reported on the eviction from its tower throughout the day. Once finished, the police thanked the demonstrators over a loudspeaker for their nonviolent approach.
Reception.
Long after the occupation by anti-nuclear activists of the Wendland was concluded, the concept of the Free Republic of Wendland continues to be evoked. Thus in 2006, a five page advertisement by the "Free Republic of Wendland against the Nuclear Industry and Police Brutality" was published in a local newspaper. 
Between June 4 and 6, 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the eviction, a memorial and protest weekend was held near Gorleben in which about 800 people participated. During this action, members of the "Rural Emergency Association Lüchow-Dannenberg" erected a "hut sanctuary" in the forest in memory of the hut village of the Free Republic of Wendland. 
After the 30th anniversary of the eviction, the director Florian Fiedler, along with the Playhouse Hannover, initiated the theatre project "Free Republic of Wendland -- Reactivated" from 17 until 26 September 2010. About 50 students, especially from the gesamtschule IGS Roderbruch, and 25 adults from the Ballhof Theatre in Hannover erected a hut village in Ballhof Square along the same lines of the original protest village. Several performances, including puppet acts by the Bread and Puppet Theater, as well as concerts, lectures and discussions on nuclear power took place. The festivities were kicked off with a performance by Ton Steine Scherben and concluded with a discussion led by Oskar Negt. A lot of media attention was focused on the project after someone threw a pie at Green Party member Trittin during a panel discussion. 
After nine days the hut village was dismantled. Two of the wooden huts were brought to the Wendland in order to provide an anti-nuclear activist shelter.
As before, the flag with the coat of arms of Wendland is a symbol of the anti-nuclear movement. It can be purchased in many places, and occasionally Wends Passports with stamps are offered at some protest camps.

Endometrin

Endometrin (progesterone) Vaginal Insert 100 mg is a brand of micronized progesterone inserts for luteal support, from Ferring Pharmaceuticals in Parsippany, New Jersey, which was FDA-approved in June 2007 for use in the United States.
Inactive ingredients include lactose monohydrate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, adipic acid, and sodium bicarbonate. Other progesterone formulations—via oral pill or intramuscular injection—contain peanut or sesame oil, which may cause allergic reactions in some people. Endometrin is free of these substances.
Endometrin is used for luteal support, facilitating for embryo implantation and early pregnancy by supplementation of corpus luteal function as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment program for infertile women or women undergoing ART treatment due to male factor infertility.
The dose of Endometrin is a 100-mg insert, administered vaginally two or three times daily starting the day after egg retrieval and continuing for up to 10 weeks' total duration. The safety and effectiveness of Endometrin was demonstrated in the largest US IVF trial to date including 1,211 women. 
Indication.
Endometrin administered as a progesterone vaginal insert is indicated to support embryo implantation and early pregnancy by supplementation of corpus luteal function as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment for infertile women or women undergoing ART treatment due to male factor infertility. 
Important Safety Information.
Only physicians thoroughly familiar with infertility treatment should prescribe Endometrin. In clinical trials (n=808), adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than or equal to 2% included: uterine spasm (3% to 4%) and vaginal bleeding (3%). Vaginal irritation, itching, burning or discomfort, urticaria, and peripheral edema were reported at an incidence of less than 2%. Endometrin is expected to have adverse reactions similar to other drugs containing progesterone (breast tenderness, bloating, mood swings, irritability, and drowsiness).

Wildfire modeling

In computational science, wildfire modeling is concerned with numerical simulation of wildland fires in order to understand and predict fire behavior. Wildfire modeling can ultimately aid wildland fire suppression, namely increase safety of firefighters and the public, reduce risk, and minimize damage. Wildfire modeling can also aid in protecting ecosystems, watersheds, and air quality.
Objectives of wildfire modeling.
Wildfire modeling attempts to reproduce fire behavior, such as how quickly the fire spreads, in which direction, how much heat it generates. A key input to behavior modeling is the Fuel Model, or type of fuel, through which the fire is burning. Behavior modeling can also include whether the fire transitions from the surface (a "surface fire") to the tree crowns (a "crown fire"), as well as extreme fire behavior including rapid rates of spread, fire whirls, and tall well-developed convection columns. Fire modeling also attempts to estimate fire effects, such as the ecological and hydrological effects of the fire, fuel consumption, tree mortality, and amount and rate of smoke produced.
Environmental factors.
Wildland fire behavior is affected by weather, fuel characteristics, and topography.
Weather influences fire through wind and moisture. Wind increases the fire spread in the wind direction, higher temperature makes the fire burn faster, while higher relative humidity, and precipitation (rain or snow) may slow it down or extinguish it altogether. Weather involving fast wind changes can be particularly dangerous, since they can suddenly change the fire direction and behavior. Such weather includes cold fronts, foehn winds, thunderstorm downdrafts, sea and land breeze, and diurnal slope winds. 
Wildfire fuel includes grass, wood, and anything else that can burn. Small dry twigs burn faster while large logs burn slower; dry fuel ignites more easily and burns faster than wet fuel. 
Topography factors that influence wildfires include the orientation toward the sun, which influences the amount of energy received from the sun, and the slope (fire spreads faster uphill). Fire can accelerate in narrow canyons and it can be slowed down or stopped by barriers such as creeks and roads.
These factors act in combination. Rain or snow increases the fuel moisture, high relative humidity slows the drying of the fuel, while winds can make fuel dry faster. Wind can change the fire-accelerating effect of slopes to effects such as downslope windstorms (called Santa Annas, foehn winds, East winds, depending on the geographic location). Fuel properties may vary with topography as plant density varies with elevation or aspect with respect to the sun. 
It has long been recognized that "fires create their own weather." That is, the heat and moisture created by the fire feed back into the atmosphere, creating intense winds that drive the fire behavior. The heat produced by the wildfire changes the temperature of the atmosphere and creates strong updrafts, which can change the direction of surface winds. The water vapor released by the fire changes the moisture balance of the atmosphere. The water vapor can be carried away, where the latent heat stored in the vapor is released through condensation.
Approaches to fire modeling.
Like all models in computational science, fire models need to strike a balance between fidelity, availability of data, and fast execution. Wildland fire models span a vast range of complexity, from simple cause and effect principles to the most physically complex presenting a difficult supercomputing challenge that cannot hope to be solved faster than real time.
Empirical models.
Conceptual models from experience and intuition from past fires can be used to anticipate the future. Many semi-empirical fire spread equations as in, and and for Australasian fuel complexes have been developed for quick estimation of fundamental parameters of interest such as fire spread rate, flame length, and fireline intensity of surface fires at a point for specific fuel complexes, assuming a representative point-location wind and terrain slope. Based on the work in and the quasi-steady equilibrium spread rate calculated for a surface fire on flat ground in no-wind conditions was calibrated using data of piles of sticks burned in a flame chamber/wind tunnel to represent other wind and slope conditions for the fuel complexes tested.
Two-dimensional fire growth models such as FARSITE and Prometheus, the Canadian wildland fire growth model designed to work in Canadian fuel complexes, have been developed that apply such semi-empirical relationships and others regarding ground-to-crown transitions to calculate fire spread and other parameters along the surface. Certain assumptions must be made in models such as FARSITE and Prometheus to shape the fire growth for example, Prometheus and FARSITE use the Huygens principle of wave propagation. A set of equations that can be used to propagate (shape and direction) a fire front using an elliptical shape was developed in. Although more sophisticated applications use a three-dimensional numerical weather prediction system to provide inputs such as wind velocity to one of the fire growth models listed above, the input was passive and the feedback of the fire upon the atmospheric wind and humidity are not accounted for.
Physically based models and coupling with the atmosphere.
A simplified physically based two-dimensional fire spread models based upon conservation laws that use radiation as the dominant heat transfer mechanism and convection, which represents the effect of wind and slope, lead to reaction-diffusion systems of partial differential equations.
More complex physical models join computational fluid dynamics models with a wildland fire component and allow the fire to feed back upon the atmosphere. These models include NCAR's Coupled Atmosphere-Wildland Fire-Environment (CAWFE) model developed in, WRF-Fire at NCAR and University of Colorado Denver which combines the Weather Research and Forecasting model with a spread model by the level set method, University of Utah's Coupled Atmosphere-Wildland Fire Large Eddy Simulation in, Los Alamos National Laboratory's FIRETEC developed in, and the WUI (Wildland Urban Interface) Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS) and, to some degree, the two-dimensional model FIRESTAR. These tools have different emphases and have been applied to better understand the fundamental aspects of fire behavior, such as fuel inhomogeneities on fire behavior, feedbacks between the fire and the atmospheric environment as the basis for the universal fire shape, and are beginning to be applied to wildland urban interface house-to-house fire spread at the community-scale.
The cost of added physical complexity is a corresponding increase in computational cost, so much so that a full three-dimensional explicit treatment of combustion in wildland fuels by direct numerical simulation (DNS) at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling does not exist, is beyond current supercomputers, and does not currently make sense to do because of the limited skill of weather models at spatial resolution under 1 km. Consequently, even these more complex models parameterize the fire in some way, for example, use to calculate local fire spread rates using fire-modified local winds. And, although FIRETEC and WFDS carry prognostic conservation equations for the reacting fuel and oxygen concentrations, the computational grid cannot be fine enough to resolve the reaction rate-limiting mixing of fuel and oxygen, so approximations must be made concerning the subgrid-scale temperature distribution or the combustion reaction rates themselves. These models also are too small-scale to interact with a weather model, so the fluid motions use a computational fluid dynamics model confined in a box much smaller than the typical wildfire.
Data assimilation.
Data assimilation periodically adjusts the model state to incorporate new data using statistical methods. Because fire is highly nonlinear and irreversible, data assimilation for fire models poses special challenges, and standard methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) do not work well. Statistical variability of corrections and especially large corrections may result in nonphysical states, which tend to be preceded or accompanied by large spatial gradients. In order to ease this problem, the regularized EnKF penalizes large changes of spatial gradients in the Bayesian update in EnKF. The regularization technique has a stabilizing effect on the simulations in the ensemble but it does not improve much the ability of the EnKF to track the data: The posterior ensemble is made out of linear combinations of the prior ensemble, and if a reasonably close location and shape of the fire cannot be found between the linear combinations, the data assimilation is simply out of luck, and the ensemble cannot approach the data. From that point on, the ensemble evolves essentially without regard to the data. This is called filter divergence. So, there is clearly a need to adjust the simulation state by a position change rather than an additive correction only. The "morphing EnKF" combines the ideas of data assimilation with image registration and morphing to provide both additive and position correction in a natural manner, and can be used to change a model state reliably in response to data.
Limitations and practical use.
The limitations on fire modeling are not entirely computational. At this level, the models encounter limits in knowledge about the composition of pyrolysis products and reaction pathways, in addition to gaps in basic understanding about some aspects of fire behavior such as fire spread in live fuels and surface-to-crown fire transition.
Thus, while more complex models have value in studying fire behavior and testing fire spread in a range of scenarios, from the application point of view, FARSITE and Palm-based applications of BEHAVE have shown great utility as practical in-the-field tools because of their ability to provide estimates of fire behavior in real time. While the coupled fire-atmosphere models have the ability to incorporate the ability of the fire to affect its own local weather, and model many aspects of the explosive, unsteady nature of fires that cannot be incorporated in current tools, it remains a challenge to apply these more complex models in a faster-than-real-time operational environment. Also, although they have reached a certain degree of realism when simulating specific natural fires, they must yet address issues such as identifying what specific, relevant operational information they could provide beyond current tools, how the simulation time could fit the operational time frame for decisions (therefore, the simulation must run substantially faster than real time), what temporal and spatial resolution must be used by the model, and how they estimate the inherent uncertainty in numerical weather prediction in their forecast. These operational constraints must be used to steer model development.

Maasiyahu Prison is a minimum-security Israel Prison Service prison specifically designated for illegal immigrants and others awaiting deportation (as well as others convicted of various minor-to-moderate crimes, including Israeli citizens). The nickname for the "Torani" (religious) wing of the prison is "Beis Medrash Maasiyahu" because of the wholesome religious environment and constant Torah study that occurs inside that section. The whole prison complex is located in the city of Ramle in the Center District of Israel.
On June 15, 2002, inmates at the prison declared a hunger strike to protest what they viewed as improper medical and legal treatment.
On February 11, 2004, public workers from the nearby town of Lod, who had not been paid in months, chained themselves to the gates of the prison in a public protest, demanding to be arrested so they could be fed the free prison food.
In March 2005, a wing of the prison was converted to house those detained while protesting Sharon's plan to withdraw from 21 settlements in Gaza and another 4 in the West Bank. The new wing is capable of housing 900 detainees.
Notable persons held at the prison throughout its history include:

Stoops previously served as defensive coordinator at the University of Arizona from 2004 to 2009, and Florida State University from 2010 to 2012.
Early life.
Stoops, one of six children born to Ron and Evelyn "Dee Dee" Stoops, attended Cardinal Mooney High School in Youngstown, Ohio, where his father was an assistant coach and defensive coordinator. He is a brother of Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops and former Arizona head coach Mike Stoops, currently the defensive coordinator at Oklahoma.
After high school, Stoops played college football for the Iowa Hawkeyes from 1986 to 1988.
Coaching career.
Stoops was a graduate assistant coach at Iowa from 1989 to 1991, and then became the athletic director and defensive backs coach at Nordonia High School in Macedonia, Ohio (1992–1995).
In 1996, when Kansas State assistant Jim Leavitt was hired as the head coach for the South Florida Bulls, he hired Stoops as defensive backs coach.
He served as the defensive backs coach for the University of Wyoming Cowboys from 1997–1999. 
At Wyoming he served under head coach Dana Dimel. When Dimel was hired at the University of Houston, he took Stoops with him to join the Cougars as co-defensive coordinator (along with Dick Bumpas) and safeties coach in 2000.
In February 2001 he was named the defensive backs coach for the University of Miami Hurricanes, replacing Chuck Pagano, who left to go to the Cleveland Browns.
Mark's brother Mike was hired as the head coach of the Arizona Wildcats for the 2004 season. Mike then hired Mark as part of his staff.

Antipyrine and benzocaine ear drops

Antipyrine and benzocaine ear drops is a medication for the treatment of ear pain caused by otitis media. It combines antipyrine, a pain reliever and benzocaine, a numbing agent to treat ear pain. It is sold as Auralgan, Aurodex, Auroto, among other brands, and is abbreviated as A/B otic drops.
Ingredients.
Each 1 ml of A/B otic drops contains:
Indications.
A/B otic drops is indicated for ear pain caused by otitis media. It is used every 2–3 hours as needed for pain.
A/B otic drops is also indicated for the removal of excessive or impacted cerumen. To clear cerumen, it is used 3 times a day for 2–3 days.
Clinical pharmacology.
A/B otic drops are effective because antipyrine reduces pain and inflammation and benzocaine numbs the ear.
Reformulation.
In 2008, Auralgan was reformulated to include acetic acid and U-polycosanol 410, in addition to antipyrine and benzocaine. Due to this reformulation, pharmacies could no longer substitute the generic antipyrine/benzocaine drops for a prescription written as "Auralgan". The price for the new formulation was roughly $150.00 compared to the generic price of $2.00.

Rainhill High School Media Arts College is a purpose built 11-18 comprehensive secondary school in Rainhill, Merseyside, England. The school is the official Liverpool F.C. Academy Education Centre in Merseyside for under-18 players to be educated and is a Trust School in partnership with the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts and St Helens College.
History.
Rainhill High School has its origins in the former separate Whiston County Secondary Schools for Boys and Girls which used to occupy a site in Portico Lane. These two well respected schools, which eventually merged on the 'old site' to form a co-educational comprehensive school with a sixth form, served several generations of pupils, many of whom now send their children to Rainhill High.
Faced with falling rolls, Knowsley found the school surplus to requirements and St Helens, which did not have enough secondary school places, leased the whole school from Knowsley for five years. On completion of the transfer the school was renamed "Rainhill High School". This unique leasing arrangement provided a stop-gap answer to the problem which St Helens faced but it was obvious that the long term solution lay in building a new school to serve the families of Rainhill and neighbouring areas.
The 'new school' was built between 1980 and 1987 on land formerly owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese. The 'new' Rainhill High School can truly be described as a purpose-built comprehensive school.
Present day.
A high proportion of Year 11 students continue in education, many of them in the sixth form, although there is a trend for pupils who wish to take 'A' levels to opt to leave the school at 16 and pursue their studies in local sixth form colleges instead, especially Carmel College (St Helens). Every year many pupils secure places on the university courses of their choice, usually at Liverpool and Manchester universities, but often further afield and occasionally at Oxford and Cambridge. Many achieve training places with major companies or progress to courses in further education.
Academic performance.
As of 2014, up to 65% of students from this school have achieved A* GCSE grades.

Girocard

Girocard is an interbank network and debit card service connecting virtually all German ATMs and banks. It is based on standards and agreements developed by the German Banking Industry Committee.
German Girocards are usually co-branded with MasterCard's Maestro/Cirrus or VISA's V PAY logo, allowing cardholders to use them in other European countries. As another co-badging option, combined Girocard/JCB cards will be introduced in 2012.
History.
Originally, German banks formed an interbank network connecting virtually all German ATMs. The network used Eurocheque guarantee cards as ATM cards and did not have a name or trademark of its own. In 1991, the electronic cash debit card service was introduced using the same cards. The cards used for all three payment methods were simply known as Eurocheque card (German "Euroscheck-Karte").
When the Eurocheque system was disbanded at the end of 2001, the cards could no longer use the Eurocheque brand. However, German banks continued to use the EC logo, which was simply re-interpreted as "electronic cash". Consequently, the cards were colloquially known as EC card (German "EC-Karte"). However, the ATM network still did not have a trade name.
In 2007, Zentraler Kreditausschuss introduced "Girocard" as a common name for electronic cash and the German ATM network.
Services.
ATM network.
The German ATM network connects virtually all German ATMs. However, German banks charge high ATM usage fees (up to 10 €) from customers using other banks' ATMs.
There are several cooperations reducing or waiving these fees:
Some banks participate in more than one cooperation and therefore offer free cash withdrawals at more than 85% of all German ATMs. In addition, some large chain stores such as REWE, PENNY Markt, toom Baumarkt and Netto Marken-Discount offer cashback at the till. This service is free of charge but requires a minimum purchase amount of 20 euros. Cashback is limited to 200 euros per day.

Court Manor (built as Mooreland Hall) is an early Greek Revival manor house and estate in Rockingham County, Virginia, located south of the town of New Market. With its stately manor house and prime location in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley, Court Manor has long been regarded as "one of the finest estates in the Valley of Virginia." The estate is situated on U.S. Route 11, which follows the route of the historic Great Wagon Road, a colonial thoroughfare connecting Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Savannah, Georgia. The estate's landholdings include some of land, extending from the base of the Massanutten Mountain Ridge to about one-half mile () west of U.S. Route 11.

Sometime prior to the final surveying of the Fairfax Line in 1746, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, granted a tract of land on the Great Wagon Road near Smith Creek to a Samuel Newman, who in turn sold the land in 1754 to Thomas Moore, Sr., (1727–1797). The first permanent dwelling to be built on the estate was the house of Thomas Moore, Sr., which was located on a knoll overlooking Smith Creek. Seeking to expand the size of his landholdings, Moore petitioned the Crown for a land grant of some , which was granted by King George III eleven years later in 1765. For the next century and a half, the estate was to remain in the hands of Moore family.
American Revolution and later 18th century.
In the years leading up to the American Revolution, Moore and his sons continued to expand and improve the estate. Moore's oldest son and future heir, Captain Reuben Moore, Sr., left the estate at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War to serve as an officer in the Rockingham militia under Colonel Benjamin Harrison. By the war's end in 1784, some 17 members of the Moore family were residing on the estate, both in the original house built by Thomas Moore, Sr., and in a second house built by his third son, Thomas Moore, Jr. 
After the war, Captain Moore returned to the plantation and was elected a Commissioner of Rockingham County in 1789. It was Captain Moore who selected a wide, gently rolling tract of land near the Great Wagon Road on which to build a small log house for his family. A quarter-century later, Captain Moore's son, Reuben Moore, Jr., would build Court Manor on the very spot where his father's log cabin once stood.
Design and construction.
Reuben Moore, Jr., likely began construction of Court Manor (then known as Mooreland Hall) during the last years of the eighteenth century, following his grandfather's death in 1797. Mooreland Hall would have been a rather conventional exercise in the late colonial style if it were not for the incorporation of the impressive Greek Revival portico into the design. Supported by four massive columns of the Doric order and surmounted by a simple triangular pediment decorated with a single semi-circular window, the scale of the portico dominates the main facade of the house. The large, two-level structure was constructed using bricks fired on site by the plantation's slaves. The house contained twelve spacious rooms, each with a fireplace and with large windows, affording panoramic views of the rolling countryside with the Massanutten Mountain Ridge rising in the distance. 
The grandeur of the mansion and its handsomely landscaped grounds served to match the impressive scale of the estate, which at 1,700 acres was unusually large by Valley standards. The wide, spacious lawn, dotted with large tress, slopes gently towards a spring-fed brook that arises on the grounds of the estate less than a mile away and meanders gently towards Smith Creek, which also runs through the estate. Smith Creek was used to power the plantation's mill, which produced flour and other products that were transported up and down the Great Wagon Road. The estate remained in the Moore family until 1879, when Oscar Fitz Allen Moore, grandson of Reuben Moore, Jr., sold the estate to William C. & George H. Harrison.
Twentieth Century.
While the house was originally known as Mooreland Hall, by the early 20th century the estate came to be known as Court Manor. Over the years the original structure was expanded with various additions including a large enclosed sun porch on the southwest side of the building and an extended suite of guest rooms on the north side of the house. However, after its 1987 restoration, the front, central portion of the manor house appears today as it did when it was constructed around 1800. 
In 1925, Court Manor was purchased by Willis Sharpe Kilmer, a New York entrepreneur, newspaperman, and horse breeder best known for marketing his uncle's popular medicinal tonic "Dr. Kilmer's cure-all remedy Swamp Root". The period of Kilmer's ownership of the estate saw dramatic development of the property, establishing it as one of the country's most preeminent horse studs. Exterminator, the winner of the 1918 Kentucky Derby, resided on the estate after his racing career, and Reigh Count, the winner of the 1928 Kentucky Derby, was bred and born on the estate. After Kilmer had acquired Court Manor in 1923, he had some 10,000 silver maple trees planted along the roads of the estate in memory of those lost in World War I. Today these trees are still extant and can be seen lining both sides of U.S. Route 11 as it passes through the estate.
Following Kilmer's death, Court Manor fell into a state of disrepair and slow deterioration. During the back-to-the-land movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the estate was home to a commune, and by the early 1980s, the estate's landholdings had dwindled to some , the manor house was virtually uninhabitable, and the entire estate was in a state of ruin.
In 1985, Court Manor was acquired by North Carolina textile magnate Nicholas Wehrmann, Sr., who initiated a wide-scale renovation of the manor house and estate grounds. The original section of the house and its Greek Revival portico were intact enough to be preserved in whole, but the later additions, which used inferior construction methods, had sustained far too much structural damage to be salvaged. The renovation restored the structure to its original condition and added two additional wings to the house. Also during this period the grounds of the estate were revitalized for agricultural purposes. Pastures underwent extensive renovation, historical barns were preserved, and new construction of barns, corrals, feeding systems, and miles of high tensile fence was completed. Since 1985, acquisitions by Wehrmann have restored nearly of land to the estate, bringing the total landholdings to some . The estate was home to Wehrmann's herd of purebred Aberdeen Angus cattle, operated by the firm Wehrmann Angus. Nicholas Wehrman, Sr. died on March 24, 2010, and the estate has since been offered for sale.

Philip Pusey

Phillip Pusey (25 June 1799 – 9 July 1855) was a reforming agriculturalist, a Tory Member of Parliament (MP) and a friend and follower of Sir Robert Peel. 
Pusey stood for election in Rye at a by-election in 1830 and was originally declared elected, but following an election petition he was unseated by an order of the House of Commons on 17 May 1830. He did not contest Rye at the 1830 general election, when he was elected as a Member for Chippenham. He did not contest Chippenham at the 1831 election, and stood instead in Rye. After riots in the town hall, Pusey agreed to withdraw from the election in return for a guarantee from General De Lacy Evans to protect the peace of the town; Evans won the seat.
Pusey was then returned at an uncontested by-election in July 1831 for the borough of Cashel in Ireland, and held that seat until the 1832 general election, when he stood unsuccessfully in Berkshire. He was elected without a contest from Berkshire at the 1835 general election, and held the seat until he retired from the House of Commons at the 1852 general election.
He was one of the founders of the Royal Agricultural Society, and was chairman of the agricultural implement section of the Great Exhibition of 1851. He was a fellow of the Royal Society, a writer on varied topics in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society and the author of the hymn "Lord of our Life and God of our Salvation".
He was the elder brother of the churchman Edward Bouverie Pusey. He married Lady Emily Herbert, daughter of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon, in 1822. He succeeded to the Manor of Pusey in Berkshire in 1828, and built a reputation as a progressive and practical farmer. Disraeli called him "one of the most distinguished country gentlemen who ever sat in the House of Commons"
Pusey's most notable contribution to farming was the development of a system of using lush water-meadows to support large flocks of ewes and early-maturing lambs. He was an early advocate of the use of earthenware drainpipes for field drainage.
He was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant of Berkshire in January 1831, and was nominated as High Sheriff of Berkshire in November 1833 and again in November 1834.

A Different Me

A Different Me is the third studio album by American R&B singer Keyshia Cole, released on December 16, 2008 in the United States. The album has been certified platinum by the RIAA.
Conception.
"A Different Me" focuses less on heartache and more on maturity of her vocals and lyrics. Cole explained that, "The first two albums were more…painful. It's a different me this time: a young woman who's still growing and finding myself, exploring life through different routes musically and in other areas. I wrote more about other people's situations than my own. I'm moving forward."
On the songwriting process, Cole stated, "When I hear something, I hear it—it doesn't take me three, four, five times to hear a song and say, 'OK, let's write.' If I don't write to it right off the bat, it's not working." All the songs on the album were written or co-written by Cole. Guest appearances include Amina, Nas, Monica and 2Pac. Along with the album, Cole is developing a movie based on her life. A screenwriter will develop the script with Cole in 2009.
The lead single of the album, "Playa Cardz Right" featuring Tupac, was released on October 21, 2008. It originally appeared on Tupac's "Pac's Life", but was rearranged by Cole and producers Ron Fair and Carvin & Ivan.
Release and promotion.
Before the album was released, BET released the third and final season of her reality show, "" which showed her in the process of finishing the album and writing a movie. Guests during the season include Ron Fair, Polow Da Don, Monica, and Shirley Murdock.
The album was released on December 16, 2008. Earlier that week, Cole made an appearance on BET's "106 and Park" being interviewed and introducing the video to "Playa Cardz Right". Cole also embarked on the I Am Music Tour in late 2008 and A Different Me Tour in the summer of 2009. She was featured in magazines "Billboard", "WordUp" and "VIBE" from winter of 2008 to spring of 2009.
Reception.
Critical response.
The album received generally favorable reviews. Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, calling the album "Cole's most free-spirited and adventurous album to date", going on to say that there are "at least seven songs here that rate as highly as the best from the first two albums". Jim Farber of "Daily News" also gave the album four out of five stars, noting that "Cole's assertions of sweetness and light hardly prove as seamless, or simple, as her songs declare". He declares that "her makeover feels less like a day at the spa than a night at the shrink", going on to say that "instead of seeming harrowing or dark", the album's result is "soulful and fulfilling". "The Boston Globe" said that "Cole emphatically dares to be different—and pretty great". On the contrary, Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" noted that Cole "let go of her doubt", going on to say that "it's missed".
Commercial performance.
The album debuted at number two on the U.S. "Billboard" 200, selling 322,000 copies in its first week, giving Cole her best week sales. In its second week, the album fell to number seven, selling 127,000 copies. In its third and fourth week, the album remained at number seven, selling 54,000 and 37,000 copies, respectively. In its fifth week, the album fell to number nine, selling 31,000 copies. In its sixth week, the album climbed to number six, selling 31,000 copies. In its seventh week, the album fell to number eight, selling 31,000 copies. In its eighth week, the album fell to number ten. Despite the two tracks not being singles, "Beautiful Music" and "Where This Love Could End Up" both made it on the US R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at #95 and #79. The album has sold over 1,000,000 copies in the U.S.

Ernest Peixotto

Ernest Clifford Peixotto (1869–1940) was an American artist, illustrator, and author. Although he was known mainly for his murals and his travel literature, his artwork also regularly appeared in "Scribner's Magazine". His 1916 work "Our Hispanic Southwest" is famous for including the first written appearance of the ethnic slur "spic" (although, in fact, it had previously appeared with a different spelling and pronunciation).
Biography.
Born on October 15, 1869, in San Francisco, California, Peixotto was one of five children in a Sephardic Jewish family. He studied art at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art with Emil Carlsen, who encouraged him to go to Paris. Taking his advice, Peixotto went to France in 1888 and studied at the Académie Julian under the tutelage of Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant, Henri Lucien Doucet and Jules Joseph Lefebvre. While in France, he visited the colony of the American Impressionists and befriended Theodore Robinson. He spent a total of six years in France, returning to San Francisco in 1894. The following year, he moved to New York City, and joined the staff of "Scribner's Magazine".
In 1897, he married the painter Mary Glascock Hutchinson in New Orleans. Two years later the couple returned to France on a sketching trip for "Scribner's" and ended up staying for six years based in Fontainebleau, outside Paris. During this period, Peixotto illustrated Theodore Roosevelt's "Life of Oliver Cromwell" (1904). Although he frequently returned to the United States to work, the house in Fontainebleau served as his primary residence for the remainder of his life.
After having been elected to the National Academy of Design in 1909, Peixotto's first large commissioned mural was "Le Morte d'Arthur" for a private library for railroader Henry A. Everett (not, as widely repeated, at the Cleveland Public Library) in 1911. Subsequently, the majority of his work was in mural form, most of it for private individuals.
During World War I, Peixotto served as a captain in the United States Army Corps of Engineers, director of the Section of Painting, and one of eight official artists attached to the American Expeditionary Force, whose job was to create a visual record of events. After the war, he remained in France as director of the United States Army's art-training center, which merged into the École des Beaux-Arts in 1923. Peixotto remained as the chair of the school's American Committee, while simultaneously serving as the director of the mural department of the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in New York, a position he held from 1919 through 1926, when he left to focus on his own work. In June 1921 he was made a "Chevalier" in the Légion d'honneur, for war work and the promotion of friendship between France and the United States.
However, he still served on a number of art organizations. He was the president of the National Society of Mural Painters from 1929–35, and president of School Art League of New York from 1936–40. From 1935–40 he served on the Art Commission of New York City and was director of murals for the 1939 New York World's Fair.
Peixotto died on December 6, 1940.

Estonia–Finland relations

Finland-Estonia relations are foreign relations between Finland and Estonia. Both countries restored diplomatic relations on August 29, 1991. Finland has an embassy in Tallinn and an honorary consulate in Tartu. Estonia has an embassy in Helsinki and five honorary consulates, located in Oulu, Turku, Ekenäs, Tampere and Kotka.
Both countries are full members of the Council of the Baltic Sea States, European Union and the Eurozone.
Finland's main language, Finnish, is related to Estonian, and there is and has been a certain feeling of kinship. 76% of Finns have visited Estonia, and in 2004, 1.8 million Finns reported visiting Estonia. Finnish and Swedish investors are the largest foreign investors in Estonia. Both Finland and Estonia are members of the European Union, Schengen agreement and the Eurozone, freeing international travel and trade between the countries. Finland is Estonia's top import partner, accounting for over 15% total import value in 2012, as well as the second-greatest market for Estonia's exports after Sweden.
Finland's government recognized Estonia's independence in 1920. In response to the Soviet invasion, diplomatic missions were "de facto" removed. However, when Estonia restored her independence, this "temporary obstruction" was resolved.
Finland contributed and continues to contribute military aid to Estonia, such as officers' training, and the provision of equipment.

Lali Espósito

Mariana "Lali" Espósito (, born October 10, 1991), known simply as Lali as a music artist, is an Argentine actress, singer, model and businesswoman. Espósito began her career as a child actress in 2003 when she joined the cast of the children's telenovela "Rincón de Luz", created by producer Cris Morena. She had other subsequent supporting roles in telenovelas "Chiquititas" and "Floricienta" and a main role in "Casi Ángeles", all of them created by Morena; the latter rocketed her fame in Latin America, Europe and Israel.
From 2007 to 2012, Espósito was part of the teen pop band TeenAngels, which originated from "Casi Ángeles", along with four other cast members.

The End of America (film)

The End of America is a 2008 documentary film directed by Annie Sundberg and Ricki Stern, adapted from Naomi Wolf's 2007 book, "". The film is an indictment of policy changes made during the Bush Administration, and makes the case that these changes threaten American democracy. Wolf investigates parallels between the state of civil liberties in the U.S. and those of dictatorships, fascist regimes, and other formerly free societies. Wolf discusses a number of deeply unsettling similarities — from the use of unofficial paramilitary organizations and secret prisons to the targeted suspension of the rule of law.
Synopsis.
"The End of America" details the ten steps a country takes when it slides toward fascism. The film follows Wolf as she takes a historical look at trends in once-functioning democracies from modern history that are being repeated in America today, and puts the recent gradual loss of civil liberties in the U.S. in a historical context. “The average American might not be alarmed at AT&T selling our private information to the Bush administration, but when this action is seen as part of a larger series of erosions and events, a pattern emerges with unfortunate consequences that become disturbingly clear.”
Style.
The film's style is similar to that of "An Inconvenient Truth" in that Wolf presents a lecture, filmed with multiple cameras, to an interactive audience. Break-away segments featuring both talking-head and “fly on the wall” interviews demonstrate the historical echoes and present-day consequences of the erosion of America's Constitution. These interviews are from a diverse collection of individuals, including intelligence community top brass, who are willing to talk on camera about the uselessness of “intelligence” gained through torture. The film also features grassroots political leaders, military generals, and victims of undermined civil liberties.
The Ten Steps.
Wolf outlines ten steps that "closing societies" — such as Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, and Stalin's Russia — have historically followed. These steps, Wolf claims, are being observed in America now. 
The steps are:
Distribution.
"The End of America" is pioneering a new model of film distribution that includes making the film viewable online free of charge. It has been made available in this way through IndiePix Films and Snag Films.

<doc id="20115633" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20115633" title="Dissenting Gothic">
Dissenting Gothic

Dissenting Gothic is a distinctive style of neo-Gothic architecture in its own right that emerged primarily in Britain, its colonies and North America, during the nineteenth century "Gothic Revival".
The style.
In contrast to the pure copying of English mediaeval Gothic that was being advocated and promoted by some influential ecclesiologists during the early Gothic Revival period in Britain, most particularly by Augustus Welby Pugin and to an extent in the pages of the Camden Society's quarterly journal ("The Ecclesiologist", 1841–68), Dissenting Gothic provided a less Anglo-centric interpretation of the Gothic style, and purposefully introduced modernising elements to meet clients' needs. 
In Dissenting Gothic the interests of good design could over-ride historical purity; the role of the architect was seen as originating a design solution, rather than promoting specific Gothic forms as a cause celebre in pursuit of an idealised high-church and mediaeval belief system. 
Departing from the narrow confines of the approach adopted by some of the leading British ecclesiologists' during the early Gothic Revival period, architects who were willing to respond to the demand for Dissenting Gothic enlarged their portfolio, drawing on mainland European Gothic architecture as well as English forms. Moreover they could be more creative about relationship between form and function, seeking novel but appriopriate ways to introduce elements not found in mediaeval Gothic churches, so as to create interiors that met the particular congregational needs of the independent or nonconformist chapel-builders of the nineteenth century; accommodate Sunday Schools and meeting rooms, with sometimes distorting effects on the physiognomy of the building; use confined city plots in efficient ways by varying from strict gothic floorplans and orientations; and experiment with a wide range of materials, and polychromatic designs, not found in mediaeval buildings.
The Early Gothic Revival Period.
Although the earliest examples of Dissenting Gothic were commissioned by trustees of independent churches and chapels at about the same time as the beginnings of the purist Anglo-Catholic-dominated Gothic Revival movement, namely during the second quarter of the 19th century, the latter so profoundly dominated and led this early period of 'Gothic Revival' that there were relatively few examples in Britain or elsewhere of Dissenting Gothic before the third quarter of that century. 
This limited use of Dissenting Gothic in the early Gothic Revival period of the second quarter of the century, reflected a marked reluctance by trustees and sponsors of independently funded and managed churches or chapels (in Britain, commonly referred to as 'nonconformist' churches or chapels) to commission neo-Gothic whilst the ecclesiologists were portraying it as ‘high church’ architecture. Equally, there was a refusal by some 'Gothic Revival' architects to accept commissions for ‘low church’ buildings, including nonconformist chapels. For philosophical reasons, some architects in the early 'Gothic Revival' period considered that the style should remain the exclusive preserve of the ‘high church’.
Later Gothic Revival period.
By the mid-nineteenth century, these early controversies had weakened. In England, the case for commissioning neo-Gothic designs for nonconformist chapels was persuasively argued by the trained architect and Wesleyan Methodist minister Frederick James Jobson (commonly styled, F. J. Jobson), in his book "Chapel and School Architecture" (1850); and in America by the Rev. George Bowler's publication setting out examples of elevations and floor plans for nonconformist churches in the Gothic revival style. 
By then, it was becoming fashionable to adopt neo-Gothic for artistic reasons and intrinsic appeal alone, superseding its early associations with ‘high church’ buildings and their clients. Also, for more prosaic reasons, ‘'Dissenting Gothic'’ began to become commonplace from the mid-nineteenth century onwards; by that date, the trustees of independent chapels could more easily afford the high building costs associated with the neo-Gothic style. For example, in Britain the 1851 census recorded, for the first time, a greater number of people attending independent chapels than Anglican churches; the higher level of philanthropic donations and membership fees this provided, could now become reflected in more costly building designs. 
By the time the Gothic Revival had matured into a commonly accepted building style for all manner of building types (referred to as the "High Victorian Gothic" period (1855–85) in Britain), the influence of the ecclesiologists with their vision of neo-Gothic as befitting only high church buildings and favouring only pure 'English Gothic' forms with historically correct mediaeval detail, had passed by. This later 'Gothic Revival' period saw a willingness to innovate by many influential architects, reflecting the success of the less narrow approach of "Dissenting Gothic". The architect James Cubitt embodied such forward-looking principles in his book "Church Design for Congregations" (1870), in which he noted the unsuitability of the conventional Gothic plan for nonconformist chapels, adding "there is every reason why our churches should be fitted for their destined use. It is not enough that they can be used..." His book gave further encouragement to looking at models besides traditional 'English Gothic', referring for example, to designs from Santa Sophia, Torcello, Gerona and Cologne. 
Amongst these, northern European Brick Gothic was perhaps the best known alternative to English styles at that time; partly on account of its lower cost than stone blocks, but also its appeal to a section of nonconformist though to whom highly extravagant and ornamented building styles and monuments were either too vulgar, or associated with mediaeval superstition - Spurgeon cautioned against the Gothic fashion leading to "hobgoblins and monsters on the outside of their preaching houses". 
In Australia, Dissenting Gothic became known as "Victorian Free Gothic" and whilst the established Protestant Church followed its English counterpart in favouring "Academic Gothic", the independent or nonconformist denominations often chose Victorian Free Gothic. They more freely experimented with picturesque silhouettes and polychromatic surfaces; taking more from Ruskin's interest in 'impure' Gothic styles and the artistic merits of Gothic, than from Pugin's High Church and mediaevalist approach.
As the nineteenth century wore on, Dissenting Gothic became widespread not only as old chapels were rebuilt, but also amongst the new city suburbs that were being established in England and elsewhere. for example, as notes: "'Dissenting Gothic' was the style in Bowden, 'Manchester's most relaxed suburb'". Nonetheless its appeal amongst independents or nonconformists was not universal. The Baptists, quite unlike the Wesleyan Methodists and most notably the Unitarians, did not come to a generally accepted accommodation of the neo-Gothic style and indeed Spurgeon advanced the idea that the Grecian style was most appropriate for church buildings because the New Testament was written in Greek. His London Metropolitan Tabernacle of 1861 dramatically illustrated this alternative view.
Buildings of note.

Cornish Art Colony

The Cornish Art Colony (or Cornish Artists’ Colony, or Cornish Colony) was a popular art colony centered in Cornish, New Hampshire from about 1895 through the years of World War I. Attracted by the natural beauty of the area, about 100 artists, sculptors, writers, designers, and politicians lived there either full time or during the summer months. With views across the Connecticut River Valley to Mount Ascutney in Vermont, the bucolic scenery purported to resemble that of an Italian landscape. 
The central figure of the Cornish Colony was Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Beginning around 1885, Augustus attracted a summer colony of artists that grew into a single extended social network. Some were related, some were friends, some were promising students from the Art Students League of New York that Saint-Gaudens had co-founded, and some were Saint-Gaudens' assistants who developed significant careers of their own. 
After his death in 1907 it slowly dissipated. His house and gardens are now preserved as Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site. 
Though the colony's name referred to its social center in the village of Cornish, geographically it was spread out over the villages of Windsor, Vermont and Plainfield, New Hampshire as well. Windsor was the mailing address for the entire area and the arrival point of most of the colonists, who usually came from New York City by train.

Rocky Mountain Animal Defense

Rocky Mountain Animal Defense (RMAD) is a U.S.-based non-profit 501-C-3 organization that helps eliminate the human-imposed suffering of animals in the Rocky Mountain region. The group was formed in 1994. RMAD furthers its mission through public education, community outreach, litigation, legislation and hands-on work. As of May, 2010, the group was renamed Rocky Mountain Justice for Animals under the leadership of Executive Director Karen Breslin.
History.
In 1993, an undercover exposé of horrific conditions was filmed at an intensive egg farm operation in Boulder, Colorado. Leveraging the publicity generated by the video, a small but dedicated group of volunteers banded together to form RMAD. Historically, volunteer effort has fueled the work of RMAD. Over the years, paid staff has been phased in to support these volunteers, conduct program work, and administer the organization. Today a small staff supports the organization, which continues to rely heavily on volunteers.
Funding.
Approximately 75 percent of RMAD's funding comes from individual contributions and membership dues. Approximately 20 percent comes from foundations. The remaining 5 percent comes from businesses and corporations. The organization devotes approximately 80 percent of its budget toward programs that directly support education and advocacy efforts on behalf of animals. It uses about 20 percent of its budget for administration and organizational development.

Paper Mate PhD Multi

The Paper Mate PhD Multi is a pen/pencil/stylus combination. The PhD series of pens and pencils have been specifically designed for durability and comfort, notably with a unique ergonomic, cushioned triangular grip that is endorsed by the American Physical Therapy Association. The PhD series of pens also distinguishes itself from most other Paper mate products by having a sturdier, higher-quality design.
Mechanics and Design.
The modes of the pen (black ink), pencil (0.5mm lead), stylus for a touchscreen device (orange blunt plastic tip), and retracting the pen are engaged by turning the barrel. A button at the top releases the lead when pressed, and the button's cap can be removed to reveal an eraser. The PhD is also available with a red ink cartridge in place of the PDA stylus.
Replacement and Maintenance.
Since Paper Mate has no signification on replacement parts and model numbers, there have been owners who have done modifications with other pen ink cartridges. These owners would take other Paper Mate ballpoint stick pens and trim their cartridges with the original cartridges. In addition, you can use Paper Mate's Inkjoy 100 RT substitute refills with the same process of trimming.

Sheffield Iris

The Sheffield Iris was an early weekly newspaper published on Tuesdays in Sheffield, England.
The first newspaper to be published in Sheffield to see any degree of success was the "Sheffield Weekly Journal" in 1754. This was bought out in 1755 by the "Sheffield Weekly Register", and was thereafter published in Doncaster.
"Sheffield Register".
The Sheffield Register was the next newspaper to be established in the town. It was founded by Joseph Gales, a Unitarian, who supported various Radical causes, advocating religious tolerance, Parliamentary reform and the abolition of slavery, and opposed boxing and bull-baiting.
Gales met Tom Paine, who encouraged him to found a radical newspaper. In June 1787, he began publishing the "Sheffield Register", initially in partnership with David Martin, from offices in Hartshead. The newspaper focussed on reporting local news, and on reprinting tracts by reformers such as Paine and Joseph Priestley. This was a novelty, as most provincial newspapers of the day simply reprinted stories from the London press.
In 1789, Martin left the partnership. Gales' politics became more prominent, and the newspaper celebrated the French Revolution and acted as the mouthpiece of the Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information, an artisan-based political organisation established by Gales in 1791 which called for radical reforms.
The "Register" was extremely popular in the early 1790s, selling up to 2,000 copies of each issue. Gales established a companion fortnightly political journal, "The Patriot", in 1792. The same year, the poet James Montgomery was appointed as clerk and bookkeeper for the newspaper offices.
In 1794, the Government began arresting leaders of the Corresponding Societies, and Gales wrote articles decrying this. Gales was suspected of writing a letter offering to sell pikes to the London society, but was on business in Derby when troops arrived to arrest him.
Alarmed as to his safety, Gales published his final issue of the "Register", before fleeing to Hamburg in Germany. His wife Winifred remained behind to sell the "Register" to Montgomery, who relaunched the newspaper as the "Sheffield Iris" and adopted a less radical editorial line. Montgomery initially used capital supplied by the Unitarian minister Benjamin Naylor.
"Sheffield Iris".
Despite moderating the newspaper's line, Montgomery was prosecuted for sedition in 1795 for publishing a poem on a handbill which celebrated the fall of the Bastille, and was sentenced to three months in prison. On his release, he negotiated Naylor's withdrawal and became sole proprietor. In August, he wrote a report offering mild criticism of an incident in Norfolk Street, where a popular protest was attacked by a militia, resulting in two deaths. He was again prosecuted, this time for malicious libel, and was imprisoned for six months. While he was in prison, John Pye-Smith took over as editor, and kept the paper running. On Christmas Eve 1816 the paper published Montgomery's carol, "Angels from the Realms of Glory", which was to become one of the most popular Christmas carols sung in England.
The "Iris" remained a successful newspaper, but Montgomery developed other interests and, in the face of increased competition, from the "Sheffield and Rotherham Independent" and the "Sheffield Mercury", he sold it in to local bookseller John Blackwell in 1825. Blackwell appointed the poet John Holland as editor, and despite frequently expressing his dislike for the role, Holland spent much of the rest of his life as a newspaper editor. The "Iris" ceased publication in 1848.
A "Sheffield Iris" newspaper was briefly revived in 1855, following the removal of stamp duty, but lasted only until the following year.

Hate My Life

"Hate My Life" is the fourth overall single (third American single and fifth Canadian single) by Theory of a Deadman from the album "Scars & Souvenirs". It was released to rock stations across the Canada on October 30, while in United States it was released on November 10, 2008. The track was selected as BBC Radio One's Track of the Week for the week ending March 20, 2009.
Song Meaning.
According to Tyler Connolly, the band's lead singer, this song enables people to feel that no matter how bad their own life is going, that there is always someone out there who feels just as bad.
During a concert, Tyler explained that "I wrote this song because one day I got out of bed and was like 'Today feels like it's going to be a bad day. I can feel it.' I realized that there are people out there that have it worse than most people who bitch and complain, and decided to write it so maybe it could make someone's day a little better."
Music video.
According to Theory's site, the video was shot on November 15, 2008. It was asked on the site, as a contest, for forty fans to star in the music video. It was filmed at the Warner Brothers Studio in Burbank, California. It was released January 9, 2009, on Yahoo! Music. It was directed by Bill Fishman.
At the beginning of the video, Tyler sees a hobo, and then he starts singing the song, the lyrics matching everything that is happening in the video. He complains about how he hates hobos (""So sick of the hobos always begging for change, I don't like how I gotta work and they just sit around and get paid""), he almost gets hit by a car (""I hate all of the people, who can't drive their cars..."), we meet his wife, played by his real wife Christine Danielle Connolly (""I hate how my wife; is always up my ass..."), a girl drops her bag of lingerie ("Tyler looking at it interestingly"), a construction worker's boss telling him off (""I still hate my job, my boss is a dick..."), and when he sings the chorus, a sign comes down from a building reading "I Hate My Life." Then, Tyler jumps on to a parade float with the rest of the band, performing the rest of the song. Behind them travels a huge group of people, which include the hobo, the construction workers, and the others Tyler ran into.

In 1928 he finished fifth in the 100 metre backstroke competition. Four years later he again finished fifth in the 100 metre backstroke event at the 1932 Games.
Thinking Kuppers was likely to win the 100 metre backstroke at the 1934 European Championships in Magdeburg, Hitler commissioned a large bronze eagle trophy for the race. This weighed over 50 kg and stood nearly a metre high. When John Besford of England won the race, Hitler refused to present the trophy as intended and left the stadium, leaving one of his officials to present it instead to Küppers’ rival.

Willis Sharpe Kilmer

Willis Sharpe Kilmer (October 18, 1869 – July 12, 1940), son of Jonas M. Kilmer and Julia E. Sharpe, was a marketing pioneer, newspaperman, and horse breeder. Born in Brooklyn, New York, he graduated from Cornell University in 1890. Kilmer was perhaps best known for advertising and promoting his uncle's Swamp Root patent medicine formula until it became a household name. 
Dr. S. Andral Kilmer (1840–1924) developed the Swamp Root formula and began selling it around 1878. Three years later, Dr. Kilmer's brother Jonas (1843–1912) arrived from New York City to help run the fast-growing business. In 1892, Jonas bought out his brother and brought in his son Willis to direct marketing and advertising. Continued success led them to construct the six-story Kilmer Building at Lewis and Chenango Sts in downtown Binghamton, NY as their manufacturing and business headquarters in 1903. The Swamp Root formulation fell out of favor after the advent of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which resulted in the federal government imposing testing and labeling requirements on a variety of products, including patent medicines with dubious claims. 
The decline in the patent medicine business led Kilmer to branch out into other businesses. He was extensively involved in real estate, owning a landmark family mansion in Binghamton, NY, constructing the twelve story Press Building in downtown Binghamton as a home for another new business he created, The Binghamton Press Co., building several other less-prominent buildings in downtown Binghamton, and three racing stables and estates: Sun Briar Court in Binghamton, Court Manor in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and Remlik, on the banks of Virginia's Rappahannock River. Kilmer's private yacht "Remlik" (the name being Kilmer spelled backwards) was purchased by the US Navy during World War I and converted into the USS "Remlik" (SP-157) armed patrol vessel. 
Kilmer died in 1940 from pneumonia having amassed a fortune of some $15 million, mostly from the sale of the patent medicine Swamp Root tonic, which is still for sale today. After his death, Kilmer was interred at a mausoleum in Floral Park Cemetery in the Binghamton suburb of Johnson City, NY.
Thoroughbred racing.
Kilmer was the breeder of Reigh Count, the winner of the 1928 Kentucky Derby. He was the owner of Exterminator, the winner of the 1918 Kentucky Derby and 1922 American Horse of the Year, and the breeder and owner of Sun Beau, the largest money maker until Seabiscuit in 1939. Both Exterminator and Sun Beau were elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

In quantitative analysis of behavior, Killeen and Fetterman (1988) are the developers of a major behavioral theory of timing. Killeen has also developed a theory of learning as causal inference (1981) bringing these together in his paper on the perception of contingency in conditioning: Scalar timing, response bias, and the erasure of memory by reinforcement (Killeen, 1984). He also developed his Incentive theory based on adaptive clocks. He is one of the premier iintegrators and critics of models in quantitative analysis of behavior.
In the study of memory (Killeen, 2005; 2006) addressed the issue of ascending strength gradients or descending memory traces.

List of Prime Ministers of Sweden

The Prime Minister (, literally "Minister of the State") is the head of government in Sweden. Before the creation of the office of a Prime Minister in 1876, Sweden did not have a head of government separate from its head of state, namely the King, in whom the executive authority was vested. Louis De Geer, the architect behind the new bicameral Riksdag of 1866 that replaced the centuries old Riksdag of the Estates, became the first officeholder in 1876. The current Prime Minister of Sweden is Fredrik Reinfeldt, leader of the Moderate Party. Below is the list and statistics of Prime Ministers of Sweden since the creation of the office in 1876. The list does not include acting prime ministers, the only example to date is Östen Undén who served as acting prime minister from October 6, 1946 to October 11, 1946.

A Pair of Queens

Shortly after releasing "Peace, Love, Death Metal" via Eagles of Death Metal, lead singer Jesse Hughes released the two-song EP, A Pair of Queens, on 7" vinyl as a solo project. The EP contains two tracks, both of which are Queens of the Stone Age covers, which lends to the EP title "A Pair of Queens".
Overview.
According to an interview with "Rolling Stone Magazine", Hughes reported the inspiration for the release, stating "I was in a hotel room above the Cafe 101 in Hollywood, and a friend of mine was trying to convince me she hadn't heard Queens (of the Stone Age)'s songs," he says. "All I had was my little Roland VS880 recording device, a guitar, and a drum machine. So I recorded two songs ("Go With the Flow" and "Gonna Leave You"). It's proof that no matter how bad you suck, you cannot destroy a well-written song. It's a clear ode to my friend Josh Homme, who is my guitar hero. I look up to him musically and I just wanted to say, 'Man, you rule.' It's also a vanity spite, it's 'I'm owning your song!'"

Asher Roth

Asher Paul Roth (born August 11, 1985), is an American hip hop recording artist from Morrisville, Pennsylvania. Roth is perhaps best known for his debut single "I Love College". He released his debut studio album "Asleep in the Bread Aisle", on April 20, 2009, under Universal Motown, SRC and Schoolboy Records; the latter of which was launched by Roth's former manager Scooter Braun. Roth later left Schoolboy Records in late 2012, due to creative differences with Braun. In 2013, Roth signed with indie record label Federal Prism, under which he is set to release his second studio album, "Retro Hash".
Life and career.
1985-2007: Early life and career beginnings.
Asher Roth was born and raised in Morrisville, Pennsylvania, a small town about northeast of Philadelphia. His mother, Elizabeth (née McConnell), is a yoga instructor, and his father, David Roth, is the executive director of a design firm. He attended Pennsbury High School.
After graduating from high school, Roth entered West Chester University and became an Elementary Education major, while continuing to record verses over the popular production of other rappers. During his sophomore year, Roth posted some of his verses on his MySpace page and sent a Friend Request to Scooter Braun, an Atlanta-based promoter and former VP of Marketing for Jermaine Dupri's So So Def. One week after speaking to Braun, Roth flew down to Atlanta and was immediately signed by Braun, who subsequently became his manager.
2008-2010: "Asleep in the Bread Aisle".
After linking up with Braun, Roth moved to Atlanta to pursue a hip-hop career full-time. As industry buzz grew, Roth was courted by a number of labels, including SRC, Def Jam, Warner Bros. Records and Atlantic Records. Roth would eventually sign a joint venture between Braun's Schoolboy and Steve Rifkind, chairman of SRC/Universal Records. On June 13, 2008, via the internet, Roth released his first professional release, the Don Cannon and DJ Drama-helmed mixtape, "The Greenhouse Effect Vol. 1". This resulted in Roth being the second white rapper to be featured on Drama and Cannon’s Gangsta Grillz series. Roth subsequently began recording his major-label debut album. In late 2008, it was revealed Roth was included in "XXL"'s 2009 annual Freshman Class, and was featured on the cover alongside fellow up-and-coming rappers Kid Cudi, Wale, B.o.B, Charles Hamilton, Cory Gunz, Blu, Mickey Factz, Ace Hood and Curren$y.
Roth's debut single "I Love College", was released in January 2009 and received many hits across North America. The song also served as his debut album lead single. His second single "Lark on my Go-Kart", was released March 24, 2009. After the two singles were released, Roth's debut studio album "Asleep in the Bread Aisle" was released on April 20, 2009, in honor of cannabis subculture's 420 holiday. During the summer of 2009, Roth joined fellow "XXL" freshmen alumni Kid Cudi and B.o.B, for 'The Great Hangover' concert tour. Roth also joined Blink-182 in the second half of their reunion tour in the fall of 2009.
2010-2012: "The Rawth EP" and other projects.
After touring in 2009 and releasing a second mixtape titled "Seared Foie Gras with Quince and Cranberry" in March 2010, Roth began working on his second studio album, then-titled "The Spaghetti Tree". From his friend Boyder's YouTube page, he was seen working with high-profile record producers Pharrell Williams and Nottz Raw. While working with Nottz, the two of them decided to collaborate on a project together, due to having a number of records rejected by the label due to sampling and copyright issues. The end result was an eight track extended play (EP), solely produced by Nottz, entitled "The Rawth EP". The EP, which features appearances from Colin Munroe, D.A. (of Chester French), Rhymefest and Kardinal Offishall, was released December 27, 2010. 
On July 26, 2010, Roth released "G.R.I.N.D (Get Ready It's a New Day)", the intended first single from "The Spaghetti Tree", and promoted the song by traveling to different radio stations across the country. In July 2010 "XXL" interview, while speaking on "The Spaghetti Tree", Roth revealed four tracks from the album. One was said to feature West Coast rapper Game, one produced by Swizz Beatz and another was revealed to be titled "Run it Back". On May 25, 2011 it was announced that Roth's second studio album would no longer be called "The Spaghetti Tree". On July 19, 2011, Roth released a song titled "Last Man Standing", as a single. The song, which features African-American singer-songwriter Akon, was featured on the soundtrack to the 2011 video game "Madden NFL 12".
In an interview with Rikki Martinez of "Power 106", Roth announced he would be releasing a mixtape titled "Pabst & Jazz" and revealed the new title of his upcoming second album to be "Is This Too Orange?". On November 11, 2011 he released the first offering off "Pabst & Jazz", a song titled "Common Knowledge". In November 2011, Roth signed to Def Jam Recordings through the resurface of defunct label Loud Records which is now still a subsidiary label of SRC Records. In April 2012, Roth revealed he was once again working with producer Nottz Raw, as well as Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker, on an EP titled "Rawther". In late 2012, Roth revealed he scrapped the "Is This Too Orange?" title for his second album, out of respect for Def Jam label mate Frank Ocean's debut "Channel Orange" (2012).
2013-present: "Retro Hash".
On June 5, 2013 Roth announced he would be reuniting with DJ Drama and Don Cannon, to release the sequel to his critically acclaimed mixtape "The Greenhouse Effect" "The Greenhouse Effect Vol. 2" was released on June 25, 2013. In December 2013, Roth revealed his long-awaited and often-delayed second studio album is titled "RetroHash" and is set to be released in 2014. In a December interview with on a "Juan Epstein" podcast with Peter Rosenberg and Cipha Sounds, Roth announced he is still planning on releasing his collaborative EP "Rawther", with Nottz Raw and Travis Barker; as well as an EP with renowned hip hop producer Pete Rock, tentatively titled "Pete Roth".
Musical style.
Influences.
Asher Roth cites Jay-Z and Eminem among his influences in hip hop, mostly by Jay-Z's "Hard Knock Life". Growing up, Roth was exposed to little hip hop in his family, with his parents preferring "The Temptations, Earth, Wind & Fire ... Bruce Springsteen and Dire Straits." According to Roth:
The first CD I ever bought was Dave Matthews Band's "Crash" ...That is how suburban I am...I finally got into hip hop in '98 when I heard the Annie sample with Jay-Z...When I wrote my 'A Milli' freestyle, that was me listening to 10 years of hip hop and not relating to it at all. Like, Damn I don’t sell coke. Damn, I don’t have cars or 25-inch rims. I don't have guns. I finally got to a point where I had the confidence to do this thing myself, and I was making music for me. And it turns out, a lot of people feel the same way I do. 
Asher has also stated that:
Hip-hop has always been very influential in the ‘burbs, it’s just a matter of where we could relate to it. You find a lot of kids that are really confused. You look at them and they’re dressed out of character. They don’t look right. I figured out, I don’t have to dress this way, but I can still love hip-hop.
Rapping technique.
Roth's lyrics characteristically center around what have been called "middle-class minutiae, some also consider them to be a joke." Roth's song "I Love College" is about partying after a visit to Penn State, but includes fatuous lyrics such as "I can get pizza a dollar a slice" that have been identified as "far from threatening".
Personal life.
His mother has Scottish ancestry and his paternal grandfather was Jewish. Roth does not consider himself Jewish, although his name sometimes leads people to believe he is.
Asher Roth is open about his use of cannabis. As stated in an interview conducted and filmed by DJ Vlad, Roth stated his views about the legalization of cannabis and the use of cigarettes:
Cigarettes don't do anything for you except kill you ... I honestly don't believe is the gateway drug, because I use it and I've never done anything else ... I'm trying to be open about my "pot smoking" ...

2008 Pétionville school collapse

The Pétionville school collapse occurred on November 7, 2008, in Pétionville, a suburb of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, when the church-operated Collège La Promesse Évangélique ("The Evangelical Promise School") collapsed at around 10:00 a.m. local time (15:00 GMT). About 700 students from kindergarten through high school attended the school; however, it is unclear how many were in the three-story building when it collapsed. At least 93 people, mostly children, were confirmed killed, and over 150 injured. At least 35 students, 13 girls and 22 boys, were rescued from the rubble alive on November 8.
Collapse.
During the collapse, the first floor of the school buckled under, and the second and third floors of the building came down upon it. The collapse also destroyed several nearby homes. However, only the first and second floors were filled with students, and some students were in the playground area. The cause of the collapse remains officially unstated, but residents of the town have said they suspect poor-quality construction as a cause.
The school had previously experienced a partial collapse in 2000, but it was rebuilt. After the first collapse, neighbors living downhill from the school abandoned their property out of fear that the building would fall onto their homes. The owner of the church-run school attempted to buy these vacated properties. In addition, the third floor of the building was under construction at the time of the 2008 collapse.
After the collapse, at least 200 people were seen at hospitals in and around Port-au-Prince. However, because of strikes at General Hospital and Hospital de la Paix, two hospitals in the town, Trinité Hospital and University of Haiti Hospital saw most of the injured.
Arrest.
College La Promesse school owner, Rev. Fortin Augustin, Protestant minister and preacher, was arrested on November 8, 2008. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter and brought to a Haitian police station, after he allegedly told Haitian president René Préval that "the church school had been built with hardly any structural steel or cement to hold its concrete blocks together; he constructed the building all by himself, saying he didn't need an engineer as he had good knowledge of construction."
Reaction and rescue operations.
Haiti's neighbor, the Dominican Republic, sent two helicopters to assist in evacuating the injured. United Nations peacekeepers, stationed in the country since the 2004 coup d'état, are assisting in the rescue efforts, as are members of the aid group Doctors Without Borders and the International Red Cross. The U.S. Agency for International Development sent a disaster response team to the school, and will be providing more logistical and rescue equipment. This consists of some 38 Virginia search-and-rescue officials and four rescue dogs, (led by Capt. Michael Istvan, operations chief for the Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue team, flown by Alexandre Deprez, acting director for the U.S. Agency for International Development in Haiti). Also, a team of 15 Martinique firefighters and doctors, led by Daniel Vigee, and groups from Médecins sans Frontières and Haiti arrived to rescue the remaining trapped children.
Hilario Davide, Jr. reported that “Filipino Blue Berets were the first to arrive at the scene on November 7 and immediately went to action, using their bare hands to roll over concrete slabs and dig through the rubble in their bid to pull out both the living and the dead. 157 officers and enlisted personnel from the Philippine Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as 13 other officers from the Philippine National Police, are serving with the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). The Filipinos were instrumental in the recovery of 9 victims who survived the tragedy.” The Filipino peace-keepers worked with blue helmets from Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador and Haitian police.
Related incidents.
Only five days after the Pétionville school disaster, portions of Grace Divine School in Port-au-Prince also collapsed.

American Soldier (album)

American Soldier is the eleventh studio album by American progressive metal band Queensrÿche; it is a concept album released on March 31, 2009. The album debuted at No. 25 on the Billboard 200 chart. As its title suggests, "American Soldier" revolves around the lives and experiences of those who serve or have served in the United States armed forces.
Following the departure of Mike Stone, the album was the first to be recorded by Queensrÿche as a quartet.
Overview.
The lyrical contents to the songs on "American Soldier" tell the story of war from a firsthand perspective. The album was produced by Jason Slater, who also produced and co-wrote Queensrÿche's 2006 album "", and was engineered by Kelly Gray, who was Queensrÿche's guitarist and producer from 1998–2001. It was recorded in 2008 over the course of nine months.
The album includes a particularly personal duet between Geoff Tate and his daughter Emily. The song, entitled "Home Again," focuses on a father returning home to his family after having been gone an extended period. This theme reflects both the life of Tate as a touring musician and the life of one who serves in the military.
Tate spent a few years interviewing veterans from all conflicts America has been involved in from World War II to the Iraq War, including his own father and collecting their stories in order to help him write the album.
Speaking about the inspiration for the album, Tate said:
Touring.
An extensive U.S. spring tour began on April at Snoqualmie Casino in the band’s hometown of Seattle. The shows are presented in three suites, with the band performing sets from "American Soldier", "Rage for Order", and "Empire".
During the "American Soldier" tour in the fall of 2009, the band featured a 3-song set with Lita Ford performing "Crave", "Patriotic SOB" and "Close My Eyes Forever".

Capture of the Jeune Richard

The capture of the "Jeune Richard" was the result of a naval engagement that took place in the Caribbean on 1 October 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars, between the British packet ship "Windsor Castle", and the French privateer "Jeune Richard". In an unequal battle, the "Windsor Castle", under the command of her acting-captain William Rogers, not only defended repeated attacks from the privateer, but finally engaged her, boarded her and after overpowering the much larger crew, forced them below decks and took the privateer as their prize. The victory was widely reported in contemporary papers and journals, Rogers and his crew were hailed as heroes and lavishly rewarded for their valour.
Background.
The "Windsor Castle" sailed from England under the command of Acting-Captain William Rogers, bound for the Leeward Islands and Barbados in September 1807, carrying the mail. She carried six 4-pounder guns and two 9-pounder carronades, and had a crew of 28 men and boys. Early on the morning of 1 October a sail was sighted, and by half past eight the mystery ship was piling on sail to catch the packet. Identifying her as a privateer schooner, Rogers attempted to outrun the enemy, but she continued to close and he realised he would be compelled to fight. His enemy was the "Jeune Richard", carrying six long 6-pounder guns and one long 18-pounder gun, a considerably heavier weight of shot than the "Windsor Castle". The "Jeune Richard" also had a crew of 92, over three times that of the British packet.
Battle.
Rogers prepared for action, and stood by to sink the mail should it become necessary to keep it out of enemy hands. By noon the "Jeune Richard" had closed the distance, and running up the French colours, she opened fire. The "Windsor Castle" returned fire, at which the French called on Rogers to surrender. He refused, so the "Jeune Richard" ran alongside the "Windsor Castle" deploying grappling irons, and attempted to board. The "Windsor Castle"′s crew mustered with pikes and repelled the boarders, killing or wounding between eight and ten of the French. The "Jeune Richard"′s crew attempted to cut the lines and pull away but the "Windsor Castle"′s main yard remained locked in the privateer's rigging, holding the two ships together.
The fighting continued for several hours, but by 3pm one of the "Windsor Castle"′s 9-pounder carronades had been brought up on deck and loaded with double grape, canister and 100 musket balls. When the French made another attempt to force their way aboard, the British discharged it to great effect, sweeping the privateer's decks and causing considerable casualties and damage. Rogers then led five of his men onto the "Jeune Richard" and forced the French from their guns, driving them below after a fierce fight and securing control of the privateer. With the French crew trapped below but still considerably greater in number than the small British force that had control of the decks, Rogers ordered each Frenchman up on deck one at a time, where he had them placed in irons.
Aftermath.
With the "Jeune Richard" secured, Rogers took her and the "Windsor Castle" to the nearest British port. The British had three dead and ten wounded, the French had twenty-one dead and thirty-three wounded. Rogers then made his report to the officer commanding the station, Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. Cochrane forwarded his report to the Admiralty, adding an accompanying note; The news of how Rogers had turned upon his pursuer and taken her as his prize created a sensation. The account appeared in numerous newspapers, journals and periodicals. Societies and guilds joined to raise subscriptions to reward Rogers and his crew. In addition to sums of money Rogers received two swords, a piece of plate worth 100 guineas, a vase worth £60 and command of another packet ship. The artist Samuel Drummond painted Rogers' portrait, and also created a depiction of the action, while other engravers and artists produced versions to illustrate the stories carried in the papers.

Alsop High School

Alsop High School is a community secondary school in Walton, Liverpool, L4 6SH, England. It holds specialist certification in both Technology and Applied Learning (Vocational).
History.
The school was founded by the Liverpool Education Committee, in 1919, under the chairmanship of James W. Alsop. The school moved to its current premises on Queen's Drive in 1926. 
After World War II, further buildings were constructed - a dining annex, an assembly hall, a library and an art room, which was completed around 1953-4. Previously the Hall had been on the ground floor behind the front tower with windows onto the yard. When the new hall was opened, this area was converted into three classrooms onto the yard, and laboratories to the front onto Queens Drive.
Further additions later, included a new block with laboratories, a gym, and a metalwork shop. In recent years, the school also acquired the old Arnot Street school on County Road and adjacent to Arnot Street primary school. The lower school was designed by Gilling Dod, based in the Cunard Building, Liverpool. The lower school was demolished and the site has since been used to develop a Tesco Metro store and a car park.
Campus.
Alsop High School is the largest secondary school in Liverpool at present. The current Alsop High School building was built in 1926, and an extensive refurbishment / backlog maintenance of the existing campus buildings began in September 2008. The campus recently benefited from the construction of a new £8.4m building designed by architects 2020 Liverpool [http://www.2020liverpool.co.uk/] and includes a new cafeteria, new 6th form facilities, reception area, atrium, new Spanish and English learning pods with improved IT facilities and a new dance and activity studio. The site has also benefited from extensive new landscaping and refurbishment of the listed rectory building. Since 2011, former headteacher Mr Jamieson retired. However, Mr Mangan decided to spend £15,000.000 on a modern formed building named 'The Jamieson Building'
Curriculum.
The Alsop High School was awarded of Applied Learning status in 2006, allowing the school to offer a range of vocational subjects.
In some subjects at Key Stage 3, students are taught in mixed ability classes, whilst in other subjects students are placed in teaching groups according to motivation, attainment and ability.
All students at Key Stage 3 study English, mathematics, science, humanities, Spanish, PE, music, drama, art and design as well as PSHCE, picking up the additional subjects of IT and Technology in Years 8 and 9.
Extracurricular activities.
The PE department runs activities that include athletics, badminton, basketball, boxing, cricket, fitness, football, hockey, lifestyles, netball, rounders, rugby, swimming, table tennis and trampolining.
Other activities include art, dance, drama, Duke of Edinburgh's Award, guitar, keyboard, maths revision club, study club and Young Enterprise.
In 2011, the Alsop Community Magazine was founded. Since then, it has published three editions of the free magazine which contains news about the school. It is distributed around the local primary schools and community by the contributors to the magazine, who are all Alsop pupils. You can view the articles on the school web page.
In July 2012, Alsop High School was used to film part of episode 3 of Utopia, where a fictional school mass murder is filmed. This scene received 37 complaints to UK media regulator Ofcom, proving especially controversial as the scene aired only a month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Connecticut, USA. This caused Channel 4 to consider whether to carry on airing Utopia, yet carried on after much deliberation.

Charles W. Downing, Jr.

Charles W. Downing, Jr. (1825–1862) was the third Secretary of the Territory of Florida, in office from July 23, 1849 and June 30, 1853. 
Life.
At the time the governor of Florida was appointed to a three-year term by the President and the territory operated with little federal funding, while a popularly-elected Florida Territorial Council had only minimal powers to borrow money, issue licenses, and organize a state militia. According to the State Archives of Florida, "A political protest in 1838 by Colonel Downing forced the establishment of a more representative bicameral legislature, where voices of rural farmers could be better presented. This reform was offset by the isolation of most homesteads and their lack of political participation. In 1840, Downing introduced House Bill 466 to end the Seminole War."
His father, Charles Downing, was a Delegate to the US House of Representatives from the Florida Territory.

<doc id="20116191" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20116191" title="Human rights in Latvia">
Human rights in Latvia

Human rights in Latvia are generally respected by the government, according to the US Department of State and Freedom House. Latvia is ranked above-average among the world's sovereign states in democracy, press freedom, privacy and human development. The country has a large ethnic Russian community, which has basic rights guaranteed under the constitution and international human rights laws ratified by the Latvian government.
However, human rights organisations have reported multiple problems. Especially non-citizens – including stateless persons – suffer from limited or no access to a broad range of rights. Also there were problems with police abuse of detainees and arrestees, poor prison conditions and overcrowding, judicial corruption, discrimination against women, incidents of violence against ethnic minorities, and societal violence and incidents of government discrimination against homosexuals.
Latvia in the international human rights system.
As of January 1, 2010, European Court of Human Rights has delivered 41 judgments in cases against Latvia (beginning from 2001); in 34 cases, it has found violations of the European Convention on Human Rights or its protocols. In 2010, ECtHR adopted four more judgments in cases against Latvia, finding violations in three.
UN Human Rights Committee has adopted views in four cases involving Latvia, as of December, 2010, in two cases finding violation of ICCPR (Raihman v. Latvia and Ignatāne v. Latvia). In 2001, Latvia has extended a standing invitation to Special Procedures of UN Human Rights Council. In 1990, Latvia has acceded to UDHR in an atypical move, which is understood in jurisprudence as accepting the declaration as binding.
Overviews by human rights organisations.
Amnesty International.
According to Amnesty International, non-citizens – including stateless persons – suffer from limited or no access to a broad range of rights, including the right to participate in political processes, and the right to employment in the civil service and private sector. The majority of them were born or lived almost their entire lives in Latvia. Non-citizens also have restrictions on property ownership.
Amnesty International reported racially motivated attacks against Romani people. Latvia lacks of comprehensive national legislation dealing with all forms of discrimination. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people have faced discrimination by verbal abuse. There were reported allegations of deliberate physical ill-treatment of detainees by prison staff.
Human Rights Watch.
Human Rights Watch reported in 2006 the attacks on peaceful lesbian and gay pride activists in Riga on July 22. Earlier, Riga City Council denied an application by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations for “Riga Pride 2006”. The banned march were targeted by crowds of anti-gay protesters. In 2009 the gay march was allowed by Administrative Court of Riga.
Freedom House.
According to Freedom House, Latvia has wide civil liberties. Also political rights are in a high level, though the country suffered high-profile corruption scandals during 2007. The government generally respects freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of religion. Academic freedom is respected in law and in practice. Freedom of assembly and association are protected by law and in practice. The highly competitive Latvian mass media are proving to be reliable sources of information and watchdogs against governmental abuses of power.
While the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence is generally respected, corruption in the judicial and law enforcement systems continues to be a problem. Pretrial detentions are long, police use excessive force against detainees, and prisons suffer from overcrowding and inadequate medical care. Women enjoy the same legal rights as men, but they often face employment discrimination.
Alleged discrimination suffered by the Russian-speaking community continues to be debated. Parliament has appointed an ombudsman responsible for protecting the rights of individuals in relation to the government. Two men were sentenced to prison terms in January 2007 for attacking a Rwandan citizen. The case marked the first sentencing under a law prohibiting instigation of racial hatred.
United States Department of State.
According to Human Right Report of United States Department of State, Latvia generally respects the human rights of citizens and the large resident noncitizen community. However there were problems with serious police abuse of detainees and arrestees, poor conditions at police detention facilities, poor prison conditions and overcrowding, judicial corruption, obstacles to due process, official pressure to limit freedom of speech, violence against women, child abuse, trafficking in persons, incidents of violence against ethnic minorities, and societal violence and incidents of government discrimination against homosexuals.
Specific issues of Latvia.
After restoration of independence in 1991, many residents of Latvia weren't acknowledged to be its citizens. As at January 2011, so-called non-citizens (more than by 99% — representatives of the ethnic minorities, mostly Russians) exceed 14% of the population. Russian language, being native for more than 37% of residents according to 2000 census, is considered to be foreign language in the Official Language Law; the possibilities to use it in communication with authorities and in public education were significantly reduced after 1991.
Like in many post-socialist countries, a restitution of real estate has taken place in Latvia. Therefore a considerable part of former tenants of public housing found themselves in private housing, with higher rent. Rent control for such dwellings was, after multiple extensions, phased out in 2007.
Since 2003, conflicts concerning freedom of assembly are often: on various occasions, gatherings of LGBT and counter-meetings, commemorations of Latvian Legion of SS soldiers and counter-meetings, meetings of the Russian School Defense Staff were banned or limited.
Limitations to eligibility and their enforcement were in the focus of several ECtHR judgments in cases against Latvia ("Ādamsons v. Latvia, Ždanoka v. Latvia, Podkolzina v. Latvia") and UN Human Rights Committee views in case "Ignatāne v. Latvia".
Participation, economic, social and cultural rights in digits.
In the local elections of 2009, 79.7% of elected councillors indicated their ethnicity as ethnic Latvians, 65.5% were male. In the parliamentary elections of 2010, 81 of 100 elected MPs were males, 76 indicated their ethnicity as ethnic Latvians. For comparison, in the beginning of 2010 ethnic Latvians were 59.4% of the population (and 71.8% among citizens) and women — 53.9%.
As of September, 2012, minimum consumer basket was 175.88 LVL (approx. 250 EUR), the minimal salary being 200 LVL) before tax-paying and the minimal age pension — 49.5 LVL. Average calculated age pension in August 2012 was 190.76 LVL. Average salary after tax-paying in June, 2012, was 347 LVL, varying from 247 LVL in Latgale till 392 LVL in Riga.
Unemployment rate in the end of September, 2012, was 11.0% according to State Employment Agency, varying between 7.3% in Riga region and 21.6% in Latgale. Ethnic minorities and persons not indicating ethnicity composed 46.2% of the unemployed in the end of August 2012.
Life expectancy at birth was estimated as 72.93 years in 2012. In 2011, there were 6.3 outpatient visits to physicians per capita, 58.8 hospital beds and 39.1 physicians per 10 000 population.
Pre-school education and nine-years basic education are compulsory. Secondary education (forms 10-12) is free in public schools. However, according to Ombudsman, the constitutional principle of free education is violated by practice of parents having to buy textbooks. According to 2000 census, 13.9% of those aged 15 and older and giving answers on own education have had obtained higher education. In 2011, 94.6% of basic school (9 years) graduates had continued their studies, as well as 63.6% of secondary school graduates had done.
Human rights legislation and offices.
National law.
Human rights are granted by Chapter VIII of the Constitution — "Fundamental Human Rights", adopted in 1998 and consisting of 28 articles. It includes both first-generation and second-generation human rights as well as some third-generation human rights: rights of persons belonging to ethnic minorities and right to live in a benevolent environment. Article 116 defines goals allowing limitations of certain human rights: these are the rights of other people, the democratic structure of the state, public safety, welfare and morals.
Until adopting this chapter the core law in the field of human rights was the Constitutional Law "The Rights and Obligations of a Citizen and a Person", adopted in 1991.

Toby Maduot

Dr. Toby Maduot Parek (1936-2012), was the chairman of the Sudan African National Union (SANU),a member of parliament in the government of southern Sudan (GOSS) Legislative Assembly, and a member of the Sudanese Group for Human Rights (SGHR).
Late Dr. Toby Maduot was born in Rualbet in Tonj North County in 1936, and after early studies in his native Tonj and secondary school at Ahfad in Omdurman, he completed his medical training at Charles University in Czechoslovakia. 
Following his return from Eastern Europe in 1965, he worked as a medical doctor in central Sudan and Khartoum, and then joined politics as a SANU member under the leadership of late William Deng Nhial. He held posts as a Minister at the Presidency in Khartoum in 1969, and then as the first Southern Commissioner of Bahr El-ghazal in 1971. 
After the Addis Ababa Agreement in 1972, he was elected to the People’s Assembly and named the first Minister of Health of the Southern Regional Government. He subsequently held the Information and Housing portfolios under the then High Executive Council for Southern Sudan. However, his greatest contribution was in his field as a Medical Doctor who selflessly served in the all corners of Sudan, and especially during the years of the second civil war when his clinic in El Haj Yousif in Khartoum was a sanctuary and refuge for thousands of displaced South Sudanese and other marginalized Sudanese living in the shantytowns of Khartoum. 
Lat Dr. Toby was a political philosopher and played an instrumental role in shaping the ideology of SANU which later gave birth to Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement. Working closely with his brother-in-law William Deng Nhial, one of Sudan's most important nationalist leaders in post-independence Sudan, he achieved recognition by the national government as they represented the first southern Sudanese political party. After the 1969 October Revolution, Dr. Maduot served in the cabinet and then was named Commissioner for Bahr al-Ghazal province in 1971.
After the signing of the Addis Ababa Agreement of 1972, in which he played a key role, Dr. Maduot became a member of the Southern Region High Executive Council and was elected to the Regional Peoples Assembly. Dr. Maduot is a principled human rights activist, secularist thinker, and strong opponent of the war, enslavement, and other disasters that the government has been escalating against the People of Sudan. During the rise of the SPLM/A, Dr. Maduot was one of the few southern leaders who remained in Khartoum and fought politically as he always did. He operated a small medical clinic in one of the most impoverished suburbs of Khartoum and devoted himself to fighting for human rights and an end to the war in the South. The Sudan government arrested Dr. Maduot continuously along with journalist Alfred Taban, lawyer Mustafa Abdel-Gadir, lawyer Ali Al-Sayed, and many other democratic leaders or professionals who honestly and publicly criticized the regime's repression, war mongering, and non-democracy.
Late Dr. Toby Maduot lived under intensive security surveillance before the peace agreement of 2005. He was repeatedly detained by the regime's security team for years in Khartoum. He was constantly harassed and interrogated but consistently refused to comply with the security team's unlawful procedure, which flagrantly violated international human rights law. On June 28, 2002 SHRO-Cairo issued a follow-up report addressed to the High Commissioner of Human Rights (Geneva), the African Commission on Human Rights (Banjul), and the other human rights organizations. Human rights worldwide call for the release of Dr. Toby Maduot after the government’s extension of his unlawful incarceration irrespective of his urgent need to medical attention at the time. Human rights and others became very involve and Dr. Toby became a known and respected figure as he peacefully shed light on the suffering of his people in Sudan. His Humanitarianism and commitment to democracy and human rights will remain his shining legacy for years to come. Late Dr. Toby Maduot was a husband to Mrs. Carmen Kwei Mawien, Late Mrs. Victoria Yar Arol and Mrs. Sarah Paul Lako. 18 children and 12 grandchildren survive him. His body rests in Tonj Southern Sudan.

William Alexander (rugby player)

William "Billy" Alexander (16 July 1874 – 1 November 1937) was a Welsh international rugby union prop who played club rugby for Llwynypia.
Club career.
Alexander began his club rugby days with local rugby team Glynneath, but later moved to Rhondda team Llwynypia. Although an unfashionable second tier club, Llwynypia provided several international caps around the turn of the century as the 'Rhondda forward' gained acceptability into the Welsh pack. Alexander as a strong prop forward was first selected to represent Wales in the 1898 Home Nations Championship in a game against Ireland, under the captaincy of Billy Bancroft. After a strong Welsh win, Alexander retained his position for the last game of the campaign against England.
Alexander was back for all three matches of the 1899 Championship, which saw Wales demolish England in the opening game at St Helens, but then slip away in the later two encounters against Scotland and Ireland. Alexander missed the 1900 Championship, but played the last two games of the 1901 tournament. These would be his very last internationals, but he finished on a successful note with a clean win against the Irish. Alexander scored his only international points in the Ireland game with two tries. The match is noted as a transition game which saw the end of an older generation, with not only Alexander but also Bancroft playing his last game, and the introduction of future Welsh heroes Rhys Gabe, Dicky Owen and Dick Jones.

Hitlist UK

Hitlist UK is a weekly UK chart series which airs on MTV Europe. Its format has changed over the years. Originally airing in July 1992 as a two-hour television program that aired the official UK Top 40 singles chart. The programme originally aired Mondays at 20:00 hrs (CET) and repeated through the week. In 1997, with the launch of localized MTV Europe channels in Germany, the UK and Italy the chart continued to air. In 2002, both MTV UK and MTV Italia discontinued the series, while MTV Europe continues to air the chart as a Top 20 playlist each week. MTV Germany stopped importing the original English series in July 2000, creating a German version of Hitlist UK, which was hosted by several German VJs up until 2004, when this version was eventually discontinued as well. From 1992 to 2002 the series was hosted by a number of MTV Europe VJ's, whereas the series has had no presenter since 2003.
On August 1st, 2012 the UK Hitlist was suspended from programming on MTV Europe.
As of January 1st, 2013 the UK Hitlist chart is back on MTV Europe - Every Thursday.
Contents.
As many other MTV programmes in the nineties, Hitlist UK is a music video programme, basing on the current top 40 of the UK chart. Due to the limited format, just the new entries and climbers would be shown, combined with some records of the top ten and the number one, provided there was a music video available. For positions 40 to 21, 20 to 11 and 10 to 2 a rundown would be included, consisting of short extracts from all songs (if no video was available, the cd cover would be seen instead; in the rare case MTV had neither a video nor a cd cover, a "video not available" sign would be shown, combined with a kind of "no signal" TV noise).
Sometimes, a video would not be shown although it had actually climbed the chart. Reasons for this would not be given, so why a song was neglected could only be assumed. In the case of Mr Blobby’s "Mr Blobby" and Manchester United Football Squad’s "Come On You Reds", both of which were number ones, one reason for showing just an excerpt of the video might have been that both records were intended for the UK market only.
For some time, the show also included songs that missed the top 40 mainstream list but which were successful in other UK charts, such as the dance, rock, indie, "breakers" (i. e. singles just outside the top 40), or album chart.
Presenters.
Hitlist UK had no regular host; it was presented by different VJs, including Paul King, Simone Angel, Carolyn Lilipaly, Lisa I'Anson, Cat Deeley, Emma Ledden, Edith Bowman and Dave Berry.

Jim Martin (Australian footballer)

Jim "Bull" Martin (20 August 1884 – 12 October 1940) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton, Essendon and Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Martin played mostly as a forward, often in the pocket. He only made six appearances for Carlton in his debut season and the following year switched to the Victorian Football Association (VFA) where he joined Northcote.
A strongly built and physical player, Martin returned to the league in 1907, with Essendon, playing there for the next seven years. Despite only kicking 16 goals in 1907, it was enough to top the goal-kicking at Essendon. He played in Essendon's losing 1908 Grand Final side and missed out on their 1911 premiership when he received a twelve week suspension mid season for striking George Holden of Fitzroy. After playing in their premiership team in 1912 instead, Martin crossed to Holden's club during the 1913 season and participated in another premiership. This made him the first person in VFL history to play in consecutive premierships at two different clubs, a feat later equaled by only Tom Fitzmaurice.

SM U-15 (Austria-Hungary)

SM "U-15 or U-XV" was a or U-boat of the Austro-Hungarian Navy () during World War I. "U-15" was constructed in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched in April 1915. She was commissioned in October 1915. "U-15" was the most successful boat of the "U-10" class, sinking six ships totaling more than . The boat survived the war and was handed over to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.
Design and construction.
"U-15" was constructed at AG Weser in Bremen for the Austro-Hungarian Navy and then shipped by rail in sections to Pola, where the sections were riveted together. Though there is no specific mention of how long it took for "U-15"s sections to be assembled, a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine "UB-3", shipped to Pola from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks. "U-15" was launched in April.
"U-15" was a small, coastal submarine that displaced surfaced and submerged. She featured a single shaft, a single Daimler diesel engine for surface running, and a single electric motor for submerged travel. "U-15" was capable of up to while surfaced and while submerged at a diving depth of up to . She was designed for a crew of 17 officers and men.
"U-15" was equipped with two torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes. In October 1916, "U-15"s armament was supplemented with a 37 mm/23 (1.5 in) quick-firing (QF) gun. This gun was replaced by a 47 mm/23 (1.9 in) QF gun in November 1917.
Operational history.
SM "U-15" was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 6 October under the command of "Linienschiffsleutnant" Friedrich Schlosser. On 28 November, "Linienschiffsleutnant" Friedrich Fähndrich was assigned to the first of two stints in command of the boat. On 18 December, Fähndrich and "U-15" attacked and sank two Albanian sailing vessels near Lezhë. The "Erzen", of , and the "Figlio Preligiona", of , were both sunk at position .
After being relieved by "Linienschiffsleutnant" Franz Rzemenowsky von Trautenegg from late March to early May 1916, Fähndrich resumed command on 10 May. One week later, on 17 May, "U-15" torpedoed and sank the Italian steamer in the Adriatic some east of Brindisi.
The following month, Fähndrich and the crew of "U-15" scored their second double kill when they sank the Italian auxiliary cruiser () and the French destroyer "Fourche" (). While about east of Otranto on 23 June, "U-15" torpedoed and sank "Cittá di Messina". The escorting destroyer "Fourche" began a depth charge attack on "U-15" and assumed success when an oil slick appeared on the surface. After the captain of "Fourche" turned his attentions to the rescue "Cittá di Messina"s survivors, "U-15" launched a single torpedo that struck "Fourche" amidships and sank her.
On 25 October, "U-15", back under the command of von Trautenegg, sank the Italian steamer , a sister ship to "Stura" (sunk by "U-15" in May). "Polcevera" was the last ship sunk by "U-15".
From October 1916 to the end of the fighting in November 1918, "U-15"s activities are unknown. "U-15" was at Pola at the end of the war when Austria-Hungary handed her over to Italy. "U-15" was scrapped at Pola by 1920.

Siege of Riga (1656)

Siege of Riga by the Russian Army under Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich was the main event of the Russo-Swedish War (1656–1658). The fortifications of Riga consisted of a wall with ditch and 5 bastions around the old town. In 1652 Swedes had started construction of a new wall with 12 bastions around suburbs, but by 1656 the work had not been completed. The Russian vanguard consisting of the Vladimir v. Vizin reiters, Daniel Krafert infantry and Iunkmann dragoons approached Riga on August 20 and threw back the Swedes under count of Pärnu, Heinrich von Thurn into the city. Von Thurn was either killed, or captured in the action. The Swedes evacuated the suburbs and withdrew to the old town. A few days later, the main army under Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich arrived on the ships on the Duna River, and laid siege to Riga. The Russian army occupied three camps, two on the east bank of the Duna in Riga's suburbs, and a Corps under Ordyn-Nashokin on the west bank of the Duna, opposite the Kobrun entrenchment. 
As Russia had no full-fledged navy to intercept reinforcements coming to the Swedish garrison across the Baltic, Riga managed to hold out until October, when foreign officers commanding a small Russian flotilla defected to the other side and the Russians had to lift the siege. In the aftermath of this reverse, the Swedes recaptured much of Ingria, took the Pskov Monastery of the Caves and inflicted a heavy defeat on the Russian general Matvey Sheremetev at Valga in 1657.
The events of the siege were recorded in an engraving by Adam Perelli that was first published in 1697 in Samuel Puffendorf's work, "Konung Carl X Gustafs Bragder".

USS Whitfield County (LST-1169)

USS "Whitfield County" (LST-1169), previously USS "LST-1169", was a United States Navy landing ship tank (LST) in commission from 1954 to 1973 which saw service in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific and saw action in the Vietnam War.
Early career.
USS "LST-1169" was laid down on 26 November 1952 at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, by the Christy Corporation. She was launched on 22 August 1953, sponsored by Mrs. John L. Clarkson of Lake Forest, Illinois, and commissioned on 14 September 1954 with Lieutenant Commander Frank S. Handler in command.
After shakedown training in the Gulf of Mexico, "LST-1169" departed New Orleans, Louisiana, on 13 October 1954, bound for her home port, Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek at Virginia Beach, Virginia Upon arrival in the Tidewater, Virginia, area, she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, for an availability that lasted from 25 October 1954 to 4 November 1954. She then joined Landing Ship Tank Division 44, Squadron 4, Flotilla 2, Amphibious Force, United States Atlantic Fleet. For the remainder of 1954, "LST-1169" operated locally in the Chesapeake Bay.
Following a short availability at Norfolk Navy Yard between 5 January 1955 and 22 January 1955, "LST-1169" made a run to Havana, Cuba, and, upon her return, reentered the shipyard for further work. She cleared Norfolk, Virginia, on 11 April 1955, bound for the Caribbean, and took part in amphibious warfare exercises at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, with a reconnaissance team embarked. During that deployment, "LST-1169" visited Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands before heading home on 29 April 1955 with units of the 3rd Battalion of the United States Marine Corps's 10th Marine Regiment embarked. After debarking the Marines at Morehead City, North Carolina, "LST-1169" pressed northward, reaching Norfolk on 6 May 1955. Except for a brief cruise to Boston, Massachusetts, between 14 June 1955 and 23 June 1955, "LST-1169" remained at Little Creek well into the summer of 1955.
Renamed USS "Whitfield County" (LST-1169) on 1 July 1955, she remained engaged in local operations into 1956, a year in which she underwent an overhaul at Norfolk Navy Yard between 21 January 1956 and 23 May 1956. She then operated in the Chesapeake Bay and off the Virginia Capes until 13 August 1956, when she got underway for the United States West Coast. After skirting a Caribbean hurricane, she transited the Panama Canal on 20 August 1956. Shortly after leaving Rodman Naval Station, Panama Canal Zone, "Whitfield County" suffered an explosion and fire. The repairs necessitated by that accident delayed her arrival at her new home port, San Diego, California, until 5 September 1956.
Upon arrival at San Diego, "Whitfield County" became flagship for Landing Ship Tank Division 12, an assignment that soon changed when she was transferred to Landing Ship Tank Division 11. She soon commenced a regular slate of divisional and squadron exercises out of San Diego that stretched into August 1957.
"Whitfield County" departed San Diego on 13 August 1957 to begin her first deployment to the Western Pacific (WestPac). She called at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, between 24 August 1957 and 4 September 1957 and reached Yokosuka, Japan, on 16 September 1957. A little over a week later, she proceeded to Camp McGill to load vehicles and embark troops for the first of several amphibious exercises. After maneuvers at Okinawa, "Whitfield County" returned her passengers and cargo to Fukuoka, Japan, before she visited Sasebo, Japan, en route to Yokosuka, where she arrived on 11 October 1957.
On 14 October 1957, "Whitfield County" sailed to Iwakuni, Japan, to pick up troops for additional landing exercises at Okinawa, returning to Yokosuka on 31 October 1957. She departed Japanese waters on 3 November 1957 and reached Son Gap To, South Korea, soon thereafter, beaching on 7 November 1957 and 8 November 1957 to load cargo that she returned to Yokosuka on 12 November 1957. On 18 November 1957, after again loading troops and vehicles, "Whitfield County" sailed for Okinawa, offloading her cargo upon arrival and taking on board units of the 12th Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division.
"Whitfield County" arrived at Dingalan Bay, Luzon, the Philippines, on 30 November 1957 and served as the base for a reconnaissance team during amphibious exercises that lasted until 10 December 1957. She then joined elements of the United States Seventh Fleet at sea for exercises which kept her busy until she arrived at Subic Bay, the Philippines, on 26 December 1957.
"Whitfield County" remained there into 1958 before steaming to Naha, Okinawa, on 4 February 1958, for the first of two voyages lifting Marines and their vehicles. She arrived back at Dingalan Bay on 26 February 1958 for exercises in which she acted as receiving ship for simulated battle casualties. On 8 March 1958, "Whitfield County" headed for the U.S. West Coast and reached San Diego on 31 March 1958.
Between 14 April 1958 and 3 May 1958, "Whitfield County" underwent an overhaul at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Corporation, San Diego. She then operated off the southern California coast into the summer. Her routine was broken late in July 1958 during the crisis in Lebanon, when American armed forces went on alert for a global posture of readiness. During that time, she cruised to Pearl Harbor between 25 July 1958 and 20 August 1958, after which time she resumed her regular routine out of San Diego.
Shifting to San Francisco, California, and later to Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, and Alameda, California, "Whitfield County" underwent an overhaul at the Todd Shipyards Corporation in preparation for the ship's second Western Pacific deployment. She sailed for the Far East on 23 April 1959, called at Pearl Harbor en route, and reached Yokosuka on 22 May 1959. She then visited Hong Kong between 9 June 1959 and 16 June 1959 and returned to Sasebo on 21 June 1959, via Naha, Okinawa. She then lifted landing vehicles tracked (LVTs) to Chinhae, South Korea, between 22 June 1959 and 28 June 1959 before returning to Sasebo.
Subsequently loading elements of the 3rd Marine Division at Naha on 6 July 1959, "Whitfield County" transported the Marines to Numazu, Japan, arriving there a week later. Shifting to Yokosuka shortly thereafter, "Whitfield County" remained there into August 1959, undergoing needed upkeep and conducting local operations.
Underway for Inchon, South Korea, on 5 August 1959, "Whitfield County" rendezvoused with other units of Landing Ship Squadron 1 and took part in Operation Seahorse, a full-scale joint amphibious exercise with embarked units of the United States Army's 7th Cavalry Regiment. En route to the maneuver site, "Whitfield County" evaded Typhoon Ellen. Embarking the elements of the 7th Cavalry at Inchon soon after her arrival on 12 August 1959, "Whitfield County" sortied for Pohang Dong, on the coast of South Korea, to take part in Operation Seahorse. "Whitfield County" proved to be the only landing ship tank involved, because the other units of Landing Ship Squadron 1 had been unable to reach the area due to typhoon evasion maneuvers.
Visiting Otaru and Hakodate, Japan, at the end of August 1959 as part of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's People-to-People Program, "Whitfield County" was en route to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, for routine training evolutions with amphibious tractor units of the 3rd Marine Division when she was diverted for contingency loading at Naha, Okinawa. She received those orders in light of a developing crisis in the landlocked kingdom of Laos.
"Whitfield County" remained in a high state of readiness in the Okinawa area from 7 September 1959 to 12 October 1959. She steamed between Naha and Buckner Bay during that time and also conducted routine training evolutions, making one transit of the Taiwan Strait and evading five typhoons. During that period, the ship earned a well-done from Commander, Amphibious Squadron 1, for her contributions to relief efforts for Japanese victims of Typhoon Vera.
Ordered to Sasebo on 12 October 1959, "Whitfield County" underwent voyage repairs there. She cleared that port on 2 November 1959, bound for the U.S. West Coast, and reached San Diego on 24 November 1959. She then remained at her home port in leave and upkeep status for the remainder of 1959.
Following local operations out of her home port into the summer of 1960, including participation in Operation Swandive, held off Camp Pendleton on 8 February 1960 and 9 February 1960, and Operation Bigtop, held between 2 May 1960 and 10 May 1960, "Whitfield County" got underway for her third Western Pacific tour. After stopping briefly at Pearl Harbor between 22 June 1960 and 26 June 1960, she joined Landing Ship Squadron 9 in Japan on 1 July 1960.
Home-ported then at Yokosuka, Japan, "Whitfield County" would remain in the Far East until 1973. Her operating schedule reflected the growing American involvement in the affairs of Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam.
"Whitfield County" spent the better part of August 1960 conducting independent ship exercises and transporting Marines between Naha and Numazu and back. She also engaged in the usual typhoon evasions common to operations in that area of the world. In September 1960, she departed Yokosuka for a six-week cruise that was slated to take her to Okinawa, Hong Kong, and Subic Bay, but, soon after leaving Okinawa, she received word to report to Subic Bay. There, she rendezvoused with landing ship tank and set out for Singapore in the Federated Malay States, on 26 September 1960.
Reaching Singapore on 30 September 1960, the two landing ships tank embarked 600 Malayan troops and their gear, part of a United Nations (UN) force assigned peacekeeping duties in the turbulent Belgian Congo.
Departing Singapore on 3 October 1960, "Whitfield County" and "Windham County" tarried briefly at Port Swettenham, Federation of Malaya, to complete the loading and embarkation process begun at Singapore. On 4 October 1960, the two amphibious ships departed Port Swettenham, bound for the port of Matadi, located on the Congo River.
The ships steamed for 27 consecutive days, crossing the Indian Ocean, rounding the Cape of Good Hope on 22 October 1960, and reaching the mouth of the Congo River on 31 October 1960. They then ascended the river some 82 nautical miles (152 kilometers) to Matadi. After disembarking the 600 troops and their equipment, the two ships departed Matadi on 2 November 1960. They arrived at Cape Town, South Africa, on 11 November 1960. They then visited Singapore and Hong Kong before returning to Yokosuka on 20 December 1960. "Whitfield County" spent the remainder of 1960 in port there.
From 1961 through mid-1964, "Whitfield County" continued her operations out of Sasebo and ranged from Okinawa to Japan, with port visits at Japanese ports, and to Hong Kong. She also operated upon occasion at Subic Bay.
Vietnam War.
In mid-1964, the tempo of operations for the tank landing ship began to change, reflecting the increased role that the United States was playing in Vietnam. On 22 July 1964, "Whitfield County" departed Yokosuka for a routine trip to Okinawa, but was called away for duty off the coast of Vietnam. She remained at sea for 41 days with Marines embarked, on station off the coast of South Vietnam and ready for contingencies. During that time, the Tonkin Gulf Incident occurred early in August 1964 and further escalated tensions between the United States and communist North Vietnam.
"Whitfield County", her services not needed in Vietnam at that time, returned to Yokosuka early in October 1964 for much-needed leave and upkeep. She next conducted type training, made a troop lift from Numazu to Okinawa, and underwent more upkeep in November and December 1964, before rounding out the year in readiness to operate in South Vietnamese waters once more if the situation demanded it.
With a logistical support load on board, "Whitfield County" departed Okinawa, bound for South Vietnam. She arrived at Danang on 5 January 1965 and offloaded part of the cargo before shifting to Chu Lai to discharge the remainder. She sailed for Subic Bay on 6 January 1965, as part of the Subic-Republic of Vietnam shuttle force. Arriving at Subic Bay on 9 January, she took on a load of cargo earmarked for Vietnamese ports and sailed for Danang, South Vietnam, on 16 January with another logistical support load on board.
After unloading that cargo at Danang, "Whitfield County" shifted to Camranh Bay, South Vietnam, to load cargo for transport to Phan Rang and Saigon, South Vietnam. Ultimately reaching Saigon on 28 January and unloading the remaining cargo, she took on board cargo to be lifted to Qui Nhon, South Vietnam. Subsequently routed onward to Okinawa after loading cargo at Danang, she reached Okinawa on 10 February.
Taking on board elements of the U.S. Army's 4th Cavalry Regiment, "Whitfield County" proceeded to Saigon, reaching that port on 20 February. After returning to Okinawa, via Danang, Vietnam, and Keelung, Taiwan, "Whitfield County" subsequently steamed back to Vietnamese waters with elements of the 1st Marine Division embarked and put the Marines ashore at Chu Lai. She continued her busy pace of operations, carrying return cargo from Danang to Okinawa, arriving at Okinawa on 2 April, before she embarked U.S. Marine Corps elements for maneuvers at Numazu. Reaching her destination on 6 April, she immediately disembarked the Marines and returned to Yokosuka for overhaul.
Following that yard work and the ensuing refresher training, "Whitfield County" remained at Yokosuka through much of the summer before sailing for Iwakuni, Japan, and arriving there on 27 August to load equipment and embark men of Marine Air Group (MAG) 13 for transfer to South Vietnam. Underway on 29 August, "Whitfield County" reached Chu Lai on 6 September. She then returned to Japan and made a second trip from Iwakuni to Chu Lai, bringing in the second element of MAG-13.
"Whitfield County" proceeded thence to Danang to embark elements of Marine Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 1/9 for passage to Okinawa. She then proceeded to Naha, where she took on board the men and equipment of the Army's 526th Engineering Detachment. Offloading at Qui Nhon, the ship shifted to Chu Lai and Danang, where she loaded return equipment and sailed for Okinawa. Upon delivering her equipment to Okinawa, she pushed on for Japan and reached Yokosuka on 24 October.
"Whitfield County"s upkeep period in Japan lasted into November, when she headed for Hong Kong and six days of rest and recreation. Departing the British Crown Colony on 23 November, "Whitfield County" proceeded to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, where she loaded 600 tons of cement slated for transport to South Vietnam. Reaching Phan Rang on 30 November, she offloaded her cargo and departed on 1 December, bound for Danang. The normally short trip became a four-day voyage after she ran into heavy weather soon after leaving Phan Rang, but she finally reached Danang on 5 December, and took on board equipment for lift to Okinawa. After first offloading the retrograde cargo at Naha, "Whitfield County" reached her home port of Yokosuka on 15 December, and remained there into late December.
1967.
"Whitfield County" sailed for Vietnamese waters on 29 December, bound for Vung Tau and her first deployment with riverine forces. Slated to join River Assault Flotilla 1, "Whitfield County" arrived at Cape Saint Jacques on 7 January 1967, embarked a river pilot and one River Assault Flotilla liaison officer and proceeded up the muddy Long Tau River to Saigon. She subsequently beached at Newport South Ramp that evening and remained there until 10 January 1967, embarking men and equipment of River Assault Flotilla I.
Departing Saigon on 10 January 1967, "Whitfield County" arrived at Vung Tau late that same evening. The next day she began providing messing, berthing, and logistical support for the men of the river assault force and the 1,800 troops from the U.S. Army's 9th Division, who were training with the riverine forces. On 26 February 1967, "Whitfield County" weighed anchor and headed for Yokosuka, arriving there on 9 March 1967. On 5 April 1967, she got underway for Okinawa to load cargo for South Vietnam. A port visit slated for 11 April 1967 at Keelung, Taiwan, was cancelled due to the urgent need for landing ships tank for the impending Operation Oregon. "Whitfield County" sped to Chu Lai, reached that port on 15 April 1967, and discharged her cargo upon arrival. She then took on board 92 tons of vehicles, 200 officers and men, and the cargo of a Marine Corps headquarters battalion; and proceeded to Danang, where she arrived on 16 April 1967.
Offloading upon her arrival, "Whitfield County" came under the operational control of Naval Support Activities (NavSuppAct) Danang to support Operation Oregon and remained in that status until 23 April 1967. During that time, she conducted two beachings at Chu Lai and transported a total of 1,300 tons of general cargo, bombs, and vehicles.
Released from Operation Oregon on 23 April 1967, "Whitfield County" departed Chu Lai and headed toward the Philippines for type training and a visit to Manila. En route, however, dhr was ordered to proceed at "all best speed" to Subic Bay. Upon arrival there on 25 April 1967, she loaded cargo from attack cargo ship . Then, after picking up additional ammunition, "Whitfield County" got underway on 27 April 1967, bound for South Vietnam.
On the morning of 30 April 1967, "Whitfield County" rendezvoused with Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) Alfa, consisting of amphibious assault ship , attack transport , and landing ship dock , which was then conducting Operation Beaver Cage. The operation, an over-the-beach landing in quest of one battalion and three companies of local Viet Cong guerrillas and at least one North Vietnamese Army (NVA) battalion, had begun on 28 April 1967.
Assigned an operational area after transferring men and mail brought out from Subic Bay, "Whitfield County" steamed in the amphibious objective area until 10 May 1967, when she embarked 100 patients and 100 empty oxygen bottles from hospital ship for transportation to Danang. Reaching Danang on 11 May 1967, "Whitfield County "returned to Amphibious Ready Group "Alfa" on the morning of 13 May 1967, again landed passengers and delivered mail, refilled oxygen bottles, ice cream, and other dairy products to "Sanctuary". Upon the termination of Operation Beaver Cage that afternoon, the enemy having fled, "Whitfield County"' proceeded to a holding area at sea northeast of Danang and rendezvoused with the other ships of the amphibious ready group that evening.
On 16 May 1967, in a commanders' conference on board "Okinawa", the commander of Amphibious Squadron 9 revealed the next operation, Operation Beau Charger. On the morning of 17 May 1967, the task group rendezvoused with stores ship for replenishment and, during the early evening hours, began its approach to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).
The largest concentration of naval gunfire support ships since the Korean War (1950-1953) softened the DMZ prior to Amphibious Ready Group Alpha's assault, which was aimed at destroying enemy forces and supplies and evacuating non-combatants. At 08:00 hours, Operation Beau Charger commenced as destroyers quickly moved in and blasted the enemy guns. Resistance at the beach was confined to sniper fire and shells from quickly silenced North Vietnamese shore batteries. Pronounced resistance came at helicopter landing zones, but despite that, the helicopter-landed Marines linked up with tank units and initiated search and destroy operations that lasted through the next week. "Whitfield County" operated in support of Operation Beau Charger until 25 May 1967, conducting replenishment via landing craft and boats of supplies needed ashore with craft from USS "Point Defiance".
Proceeding to Danang on 25 May 1967, "Whitfield County" reached her Danang on 26 May 1967 and, after offloading, was detached from Amphibious Ready Group Alfa. She subsequently transported a load of bombs from Danang to Chu Lai, loading vehicles there for transportation to Naha, before she returned to Danang to load equipment and embark men of Amphibious Construction Battalion 1, Detachment "B." She departed Vietnamese waters on the morning of 3 June 1967 and reached Naha on 9 June 1967. Offloading the vehicles and backloading deadlined generators, "Whitfield County" arrived at Yokosuka on 14 June 1967.
"Whitfield County" returned to Vietnamese waters in the summer of 1967 to resume her support operations for riverine activities in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam, basing again at Vung Tau. She departed Yokosuka on 28 July 1967 and reached Vung Tau, after a stop at Hong Kong, on 17 August 1967. Relieving landing ship tank of Task Force 117 support duties on 18 August 1967, "Whitfield County" got underway on 20 August 1967 for the confluence of the Vam Co River and Soirap River to rendezvous with the Mobile Riverine Base (MRB).
From 20 August 1967 to 5 September 1967, "Whitfield County" provided "housekeeping" services and support for River Division III, "C" Company, 2nd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, and "A" Company, 9th Battalion. She supplied ammunition, water, and rations to the troops in the field, was the focal point of helicopter support operations, served as combat store warehouse, and provided mortuary services for the killed in action (KIA) periodically brought to the ship.
Toward the end of that period, on 3 September 1967, the Mobile Riverine Base shifted its base of operations from the Soirap-Vam Co area back to Vung Tau to support projected riverine strikes into the Rung Sat special zone. On 11 September 1967, the Mobile Riverine Base proceeded to the Mekong River entrance, escorted by various units of the Riverine Division, who provided minesweeping, close fire support, and reconnaissance when needed. Subsequently, while located in the Dong Tarn area, "Whitfield County" assisted search and destroy operations in the Cam Son secret zone, Dinh Tuong province, Kien Hoa province, and in the Giong Troms district.
On 28 September 1967, the Mobile Riverine Base shifted again, this time to the confluence of the Cua Tien River and the Cua Dai River, to facilitate strike operations into Kien Hoa province. "Whitfield County" worked in that locale until 1 October 1967, when the Mobile Riverine Base was shifted back to Dong Tarn to support projected strikes into the Western Ben Zong secret zone, Dinh Troung province, to destroy North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces in that area.
"Whitfield County" subsequently supported mobile riverine operations at Vung Tau and back at the junction of the Soirap and Vam Co Rivers into late October 1967. While in the latter locale, elements of the riverine forces provided the necessary security during the lower house elections for the Republic of Vietnam's parliament. Returning to Vung Tau on 24 October 1967, "Whitfield County" was there relieved by landing ship tank and returned to Japan.
"Whitfield County" underwent a period of upkeep back at Yokosuka before she returned to Vietnamese waters at the end of November 1967. She operated between Danang and Chu Lai through early December 1967, transporting vehicles and other cargo, before she steamed back to Yokosuka. She arrived at Yokosuka on 22 December 1967 and remained in port until late in January 1968.
1968.
Underway on 22 January 1968 with a cargo of two pontoon causeway sections, the vehicles and men of BMU-1, and a CH-46 helicopter, with its accompanying Sea Van — an experimental housing seeing its first operational test and evaluation aboard "Whitfield County" — the ship headed for Vietnam. Touching at Naha en route, "Whitfield County" reached Danang on 31 January 1968, transferred the Sea Van to USS "Vernon County", and relieved "Vernon County" as support landing ship tank for Amphibious Ready Group Bravo. With the relief and transfer of the Marines and equipment completed, "Whitfield County" took on board the men and mail to be transported to Amphibious Ready Group Bravo and got underway on 2 February 1968
Over the ensuing month and a half, "Whitfield County" operated with Amphibious Ready Group Bravo within various operating areas off the DMZ, occasionally returning to Danang for mail, fleet freight, and passengers for delivery to the other units of the ready group. "Whitfield County" also sailed to Subic Bay as part of the task force for upkeep between 21 February 1968 and 28 February 1968 before she returned to Vietnamese waters. Landing ship tank relieved "Whitfield County" as support landing ship tank at Danang on 14 March 1968.
After a subsequent port call at Hong Kong and a quick run to Yokosuka for restricted availability, "Whitfield County" returned to Vietnamese waters for a resumption of operations with the Mobile Riverine Force in mid-July 1968 at Dong Tarn, again relieving "Vernon County". During her deployment with Task Force 117 in ensuing months, "Whitfield County" operated on a nearly non-stop, 24-hour-a-day basis, supporting the U.S. Army's 4th Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment), 9th Division, and three helicopters of a U.S. Army aviation detachment, as well as the boats and men of River Assault Division 92. By the time landing ship tank "Westchester County" relieved "Whitfield County" on 23 September 1968, "Whitfield County" had travelled over 900 nautical miles (1,667 kilometers) within the Mekong Delta, processed over 25,000 hot rations, and handled roughly 4,000 tons of cargo.
Subsequently visiting Bangkok, Thailand, for rest and recreation and R, "Whitfield County" then headed for Danang, where she side-loaded tow causeway sections for transportation to Okinawa. She then returned to Yokosuka for repairs before again heading for Vietnam toward the end of November 1968. Touching at Subic Bay en route, she reputedly became the first landing ship tank to use water-filled causeway sections to serve as armor along the thinly-armored sides of the ship. The causeway sections were intended provide a water-filled barrier against recoilless rifle projectiles and rockets.
After relieving landing ship tank at Dong Tarn on 30 November 1968, "Whitfield County" spent the rest of 1968 as support landing ship tank for Mobile Riverine Group Alfa, Task Group 117.1, one of the two task groups that made up Mobile Riverine Flotilla 1. Other ships of Mobile Riverine Group Alfa were the barracks ships and , the landing craft repair ship , and the barracks craft USS "APL-26" and USS "APL-80" . Embarked in "Whitfield County" were elements of the Army's 9th Infantry Regiment and a Cyclops aviation detachment, equipped with Hughes CH-6 Cayuse helicopters. The ship herself performed a fivefold role: (1) maintaining a round-the-clock, air- and water-mobile resupply readiness to provide field units with ammunition, rations, fresh water, and fuel; (2) serving as a mobile base for helicopter operations; (3) providing harassment and on-call gunfire support when necessary; (4) supplying boat service among the ships of the Mobile Riverine Group; and (5) providing subsistence, berthing, and services for embarked personnel.
1969.
At 23:30 hours on 9 January 1969, the Mobile Riverine Group base at Dong Tarn came under enemy rocket and mortar attack. "Whitfield County" went to general quarters and participated in counterbattery fire, hurling 16 rounds of 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) projectiles in the direction of the hostile fire. Although securing at midnight, "Whitfield County" manned her guns a half-hour later, at 00:30 hours. lobbing three rounds of call fire.
"Whitfield County" subsequently shifted from Ben Tre to the Song Ham Loung anchorage and returned to Dong Tarn at 11:00 hours on 20 January 1969 to commence turnover to ["Vernon County", her relief in Task Group 117.1. That night, communist forces attacked the Mobile Riverine Group and the base at Dong Tarn with rockets and mortars; "Whitfield County" went to general quarters at 21:59 hours and, between 22:50 and 23:00 hours, expended 12 rounds against the enemy artillerymen. Between 1 January 1969 and 22 January 1969, "Whitfield County"s gunners loosed a total of 78 rounds of call-fire, and the ship held flight quarters for the recovery of Cayuse and UH-lb Huey helicopters 306 times, without mishap. At 23:00 hours on 23 January 1969, "Whitfield County"s turnover to "Vernon County" was complete.
However, there was more work for "Whitfield County" before she could clear the muddy Vietnamese waters. At 23:21 hours she headed for Vung Tau. There, she took over from landing ship tank , which had recently been damaged in a Viet Cong rocket attack while beached at the Vung Tau ramps, in supporting and resupplying Task Group 117.2, Mobile Riverine Group Bravo.
Late on 24 January 1969, after loading a tank deck cargo of palletized ammunition and C rations and a main-deck load of crated supplies, spare parts, stores, and fresh provisions, "Whitfield County" got underway for the mouth of the Bassac River (Cua Tranh De). On the morning of 26 January 1969, "Whitfield County", escorted by two river patrol boats (PBRs), transited the Bassac River without incident and over the ensuing days resupplied and provisioned the ships of Task Group 117.2, landing craft repair ship and barracks ships and . "Whitfield county" then returned to Vung Tau, where she was relieved as support landing ship tank for Task Group 117.2 by USS "Iredell County" (LST-839) on 30 January 1969. At noon that day, "Whitfield County" headed for Hong Kong.
"Whitfield County" spent six days at Hong Kong before she sailed for Okinawa to pick up cargo earmarked for shipment to Yokosuka. After loading vehicles and nine men from Beachmaster Unit 1, Western Pacific Detachment, at Red Beach 1, Chin Wan, Okinawa, "Whitfield County" proceeded on to Yokosuka, reaching that port on the morning of 17 February 1969.
After upkeep at Yokosuka in late February 1969, "Whitfield County" acted as observer at the Republic of Korea Navy amphibious exercise Phiblex 1-69 at Chinhae, South Korea, between 28 March 1969 and 2 April 1969. During that time, she also trained South Korean naval personnel. "Whitfield County" subsequently returned to Yokosuka for more upkeep before she sailed, via Subic Bay, for Vietnamese waters where she loaded side-protection causeway sections.
Arriving at Dong Tarn on 8 May 1969, she there relieved "Windham County" as support landing ship tank for River Assault Flotilla 1, Task Force 117. As before, she operated alternately at Dong Tarn, Song Ham Loung (Ben Tre), and My Tho. At 02:05 hours on 6 June 1969, while "Whitfield County" was at Dong Tarn, four rounds of hostile fire landed between 50 and 300 yards (46 and 274 meters) from the ships of the Mobile Riverine Force. "Whitfield County" immediately set general quarters; and, in the next 35 minutes, her guns hurled some 140 rounds of 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) counterbattery fire at the enemy artillery. The riverine force again came under enemy fire that morning; "Whitfield County" again blasted the enemy positions with 170 more 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) projectiles.
"Whitfield County" subsequently shifted to Ben Tre but returned to Dong Tarn by 13 June 1969. While she lay anchored there, Storekeeper 3rd Class L. E. Smith, assigned as roving sentry on the port side of the ship, spotted a swimmer in the water at 01:00 hours on 15 June 1969. Since Viet Cong sappers were known to have been active in that area, Storekeeper Smith promptly opened fire. Within a short time, the water around the ship was thoroughly grenaded. Later that morning, a Vietnamese body that had been shot was found floating nearby. For his prompt action, Storekeeper Smith received the recommendation for the Navy Commendation Medal for "effectively thwarting an attempt to mine the ship."
Three days later, rocket fire landed within 50 yards (46 meters) of the ship at 14:05 hours on 18 June 1969. Unable to return the fire because of the presence of friendly forces in the area, "Whitfield County" shifted her anchorage to avoid being hit. Later that afternoon, the riverine force shifted its anchorage back to My Tho.
"Whitfield County" was relieved by landing ship tank USS "Tom Green County" on 4 July 1969. Between 8 May 1969 and 4 July 1969, "Whitfield County" had expended some 2,982 rounds of 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) projectiles on call-fire and counterbattery fire, conducted some 850 helicopter landings, and travelled 394 nautical miles (730 kilometers) within the Mekong Delta. She had also witnessed the gradual turnover of all River Assault Flotilla 1 assets to the Republic of Vietnam Navy, the beginning of the redeployment of the 9th Infantry Division from the Mekong Delta, and the gradual disbanding of Task Force 117. When she sailed on 5 July 1969, she left the Mekong Delta region for the last time.
Returning to Yokosuka via Keelung, Taiwan, "Whitfield County" soon commenced a badly needed overhaul, one that lasted into the autumn of 1969. For the remainder of the 1969, she operated locally in Japanese waters.
1970–1972.
Until 1972, "Whitfield County" worked out of Yokosuka, touching occasionally at Okinawa in the course of amphibious maneuvers and exercises and at Subic Bay in the Philippines. She served three tours with Amphibious Ready Group Bravo in 1970.
During 1971, "Whitfield County" served two tours as support landing ship tank for Operation Market Time interdiction operations out of Vung Tau. A highlight of her 1971 operations were her support activities for stores ship USS "Regulus" (AF-57), which had been forced aground on the rocks in the western harbor of Hong Kong when Typhoon Rose struck China on 16 August 971; "Whitfield County" provided berthing and messing facilities for "Regulus"s crew.
"Whitfield County" served one tour with Amphibious Ready Group Alfa and one with Operation Market Time forces in 1972.
Awards.
"Whitfield County" performed services of signal importance during the Vietnam War, services that were important but, due to their nature, largely unsung in the public eye. Nonetheless, she was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for her operations with Task Force 117 from 8 May 1969 to 5 July 1969, three Navy Unit Commendations, three Meritorious Unit Commendations, and 11 battle stars. The battle stars were for:
Decommissioning and Greek service.
"Whitfield County" arrived at Yokosuka on 23 December 1972 after exercising with U.S. Marine Corps units at Okinawa. She remained there until she was decommissioned on 15 March 1973. She was stricken from the Navy List on 15 August 1976.
"Whitfield County" was sold to Greece on 1 March 1977 under the Security Assistance Program. Commissioned into the Hellenic Navy, she was renamed "Kos" (L116). "Kos" had a long career, not being decommissioned until 1 June 2000.
"Kos" was sunk as a target on 24 June 2004 during the Hellenic Navy exercise Thiela III by Penguin missiles fired by the Greek fast attack craft missile (FACMs) "Ypoploiarchos Degiannis" (P-26) and "Simeoforos Starakis" (P-29) and torpedoes from the Greek torpedo boats "Lailaps" (P-54) and "Typhon" (P-56).

Prussian G 7.1

The Prussian Class G 7.1 engines of the Prussian state railways were German eight-coupled, goods train, steam locomotives. 
History.
They were first built in 1893 by the firm of Stettiner Maschinenbau AG Vulcan, but later by the other larger Prussian locomotive manufacturers as well. The boiler was the same as that of the G 5.1. 
The locomotives were intended for heavy goods duties especially on hilly routes. As a result, most of the engines went to the western German and Silesian railway divisions. By 1909, 1,002 examples had been delivered to the Prussian state railways. During the First World War simple and robust locomotives were required for military use. As a result in 1916/1917 a further 200 G 7.1s were built. From 1916, the "k.u.k. Heeresbahn" in Austria had 35 units of the Class G 7.1 which it named the Class 274. They were intended for use on the broad gauge Russian Railways. The Lübeck-Büchen Railway also bought three G 7.1s, which had been manufactured in 1898 by "Schwartzkopff". Another seven engines went to the "Gutehoffnungshütte". Even the Palatinate Railway placed 27 of its G 4' in service; the design of these was based on the Prussian G 7.1.
In 1923 the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over no less than 680 from the Prussian state railways into its renumbering plan; in 1925 they listed locomotive numbers 55 001–660. In 1935 13 more came from the Saar railways and one from France into the Reichsbahn fleet as 55 661-673 and 55 674. The three G 7.1s with the Lübeck-Büchen Railway were given numbers 55 681–683 in 1938.
In the Second World War 105 G 7.1s were taken over from Poland into the Reichsbahn's inventory. They were given the numbers of engines already retired. In addition, G 7.1 engines from Lithuania were added as numbers 55 274 and 55 691-694.
After the Second World War, the locomotives that ended up in the Deutsche Bundesbahn were mainly used in shunting duties and were retired by 1957. In the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany the last G 7.1 was not retired until 1966, including number 55 642.
Preserved locomotives.
Locomotive 55 669 was retired in 1964 and has been displayed since in the Dresden Transport Museum in Dresden. Photograph of the 55 669
Locomotives 55 196, 393, 400, 493 and 553 were left in Austrian territory after the Second World War. Apart from 55 553, which had been taken over by 1950, the ÖBB incorporated them into their ÖBB Class 655, retaining their serial numbers. The last one, 655.393, was withdrawn in 1957. Its task had been shunting at Stadlau station.
The vehicles were equipped with tenders of classes pr 3 T 12 and pr 3 T 16.5 (built 1916/17).

Beast (Canadian band)

Beast is a Canadian indie, electronic music duo based out of Montreal, Quebec. Beast's members include vocalist and lyricist Betty Bonifassi and composer/producer Jean-Phi Goncalves. 
Beast has been described as "an experimental hip-hop project filled with trip-hop-style down-tempo electronica, aggressive guitars and loud drum beats," or (as Bonifassi describes it) "trip rock". 
Beast’s self-titled debut album was made available internationally on iTunes on Nov 4, 2008 and their first single, "Mr. Hurricane", was offered for free on iTunes as the Single of the Week in 6 major markets including the US, the UK, France and Australia. The album's official commercial release date in Canada is Nov 18, 2008, with international releases yet to be announced.
__TOC__
History.
Betty Bonifassi and Jean-Phi Goncalves—both originally from France—were both very active members in the Montreal music scene, and had each been making music for about 20 years by the time they began collaborating musically. Bonifassi had previously worked with such local musicians as composer and saxophonist, François D’Amours, DJ/techno musician Champion, and—yet another French expat—rock musician Deweare; Jean-Phi Goncalves, a percussionist and record producer, had produced albums for Quebec musicians such as Pierre Lapointe, Jean-Pierre Ferland, Ariane Moffatt and Daniel Bélanger as well as American recording artist Lauryn Hill. He has also played percussion for the singer Dumas and for Montreal bands Afrodizz and Plaster.
The pair first worked together in 2006 on a project for the video game company Ubisoft in 2006. The resulting sound was angrier than either artist was used to: "The angry message is about letting the beast out that's inside, because in society you're not allowed to be emotive or sensitive. The feelings of the moment when we were writing were mostly sadness and anger," said Bonifassi in an interview with Canadian music news magazine, "Chart".
In a departure from her previous projects, Bonifassi's vocal stylings on Beast's debut album lean more towards rap and spoken-word. Bonifassi is the main songwriter for the band and the music is composed and produced by Goncalves. Canadian singer-songwriter Simon Wilcox also assisted Bonifassi (whose native language is French) with Beast's lyrics, which are all performed in English. 
“Simon really understood my dark side and the sadness of the moment,” says Bonifassi. “I really wanted to sing something lyrically rich and powerful.”
Goncalves has also stated that the name Beast suits their project very well: “Betty is a real beast,” he jokes, “a "bête de scène".”
Beast's first performance was on March 1, 2008 at the after party for the Montreal International Music Initiative Awards, or MIMI Awards. They also performed at two separate venues during the 2008 NXNE festival in Toronto; the Canadian news magazine "Chart" gave Beast "highest marks" for their performances at the festival. In late 2008 the duo also toured with British Columbia dance-punk band You Say Party! We Say Die!
In 2010, the video for the single "Mr. Hurricane" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video.
The song "Satan" plays during the closing credits of an episode of the HBO show "Hung".
The song "Mr. Hurricane" was used in the closing credits of "In Sickness", an episode of the television series "The Good Wife" which aired on May 3, 2011
Indefinite hiatus.
At the end of 2010 Bonifassi and Goncalves announced that they would be taking an indefinite break from the Beast project. Although when asked in a June 2011 interview for "Voir" whether her break from Beast was a final one Bonifassi replied: ""Disons que le retour de Beast n’est pas dans mes plans actuels"" ("Let's say the return of Beast is not my current plans.")
Goncalves stated in an interview that the split was not due to any sort of quarrel between himself and Bonifassi. Citing lagging album sales, frustration with the record industry, the tiresome effects of touring, and familial commitments (Bonifassi's son was 9 years old at the time of the split), the band-mates said they would be working separately on their own local projects.
Goncalves stated he would be returning to the Montreal-based electro-jazz band Plaster. In 2011 Bonifassi performed at the "Festival Montréal en lumière" in February, and she held two performances at the 2011 Les FrancoFolies de Montréal music festival on June 17 and 18.

Nidicolous

Nidicolous animals are those that stay at their nest or birthplace for a long time after birth, due to their dependence on the parents for feeding, protection and learning survival skills. It is the opposite of nidifugous where the animal is able to leave the nest very quickly.
The great majority of nidicolous animals are altricial, in that an animal born helpless, blind, without feathers, etc. simply is unable to fend for itself. Examples of nidicolous animals are most mammals, marsupials and many species of birds. However, the concepts of altricial and nidicolous are not identical. All altricial animals are nidicolous by necessity, however, an animal may be nidicolous, i.e. staying at the nest, even if they are precocial and fully capable of leaving if needed.

Paul Robinson (footballer born 1984)

Paul Robinson (born 28 May 1984 in Newcastle upon Tyne) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for Blyth Spartans.
He notably played in the Football League for Grimsby Town, where he was on loan from Tranmere Rovers. He left Rovers in 2004 having failed to make an appearance and went on to feature for Vauxhall Motors, York City, Bedlington Terriers, Newcastle Blue Star and Whitley Bay.
Career.
Robinson was associated with his home-town club Newcastle United as a schoolboy, then moved to Tranmere Rovers as a 16-year-old. He turned professional in 2002, spent time on loan to Vauxhall Motors of the Northern Premier League, and scored well in youth and reserve team football, but in August 2003 was allowed to join Football League Two club York City on a two-game trial with a view to a possible loan or permanent move. An ankle injury cut short the trial and the player returned to Prenton Park.
In September 2004, Grimsby Town manager Russell Slade signed Robinson on a one-month loan. Slade also signed Jon Daly and Chris Williams from Stockport County. As all three players were forwards, this meant the club had six forwards under contract. Robinson got his chance at Blundell Park; he made his full professional debut on 11 September 2004, playing the whole of a 3–1 defeat against Macclesfield Town. He played twice more for the Mariners, each time finishing on the losing side, and then returned to Tranmere.
Unable to hold down a place in Tranmere's reserves, Robinson returned to York City, by then a Conference club, on trial in November 2004. While the trial continued, Tranmere released the player, who then signed a short-term contract with York City. York City's squad already contained the former Newcastle United striker Paul Robinson, who was listed as Paul D Robinson to avoid confusion.
Robinson was released at the end of the season and returned to his native north-east of England, where he joined Bedlington Terriers of the Northern League, the club for which his brother Michael was playing. In the 2006 close season he signed for Northern League champions Newcastle Blue Star, and a year later moved on to Whitley Bay of Northern League Division One. In 2009 he was part of the team that beat Glossop North End in the final of the FA Vase at Wembley, having lost at the semi-final stage the previous year.

List of banking crises

[[File:BankingCrises.svg|thumb|
Number of countries having a banking crisis in each year since 1800. This is based on This time is different: Eight centuries of financial folly, which covers only 70 countries. The general upward trend might be attributed to many factors. One of these is a gradual historical increase in the percent of people who receive money for their labor. Another, elsewhere suggested reason related to more recent development trends and to banking crisis during modern era might be changes in the size of banking sector compared to overall GDP. The dramatic feature of this graph is the virtual absence of banking crises during the period of the Bretton Woods agreement, 1945 to 1971. This analysis is similar to Figure 10.1 in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009). For more details see the help file for "bankingCrises" in the Ecdat package available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). ]]
This is a list of banking crises. A banking crisis is a financial crisis that affects banking activity. Banking crises include bank runs, which affect single banks; banking panics, which affect many banks; and systemic banking crises, in which a country experiences a large number of defaults and financial institutions and corporations face great difficulties repaying contracts. A banking crisis is marked by bank runs that lead to the demise of financial institutions, or by the demise of a financial institution that starts a string of similar demises.
Bank runs.
A bank run occurs when a large number of bank customers withdraw their deposits because they believe the bank might fail. There have been many runs on individual banks throughout history; for example, some of the 2008–2009 bank failures in the United States were associated with bank runs.

Hans Schinz (December 6, 1858 - October 30, 1941) was a Swiss explorer and botanist who was a native of Zürich.
In 1884 he participated in an exploratory expedition to German Southwest Africa that was organized by German merchant Adolf Lüderitz (1834-1886). For the next few years Schinz undertook extensive scientific studies of the northern parts of the colony. As a result of the expedition, he published "Deutsch-Südwestafrika, Forschungsreisen durch die deutschen Schutzgebiete Groß- Nama- und Hereroland, nach dem Kunene, dem Ngamisee und Kalahari, 1884-1887" (German South West Africa: Research Expedition of Herero and Nama Country, the Kunene Region, Lake Ngami and the Kalahari- 1884-1887). This work was an important scientific, geographic and ethnographic study of the colony, and was one of the first comprehensive works on the Ovamboland region. It was during this expedition that he made the acquaintance of the Finnish missionary Martti Rautanen (1845-1926) at Olukonda, and named the tree "Ricinodendron rautanenii" after him.
In 1889 he received his habilitation at Zürich, where in 1895 he became a professor and director of the botanical gardens.
With Robert Keller (1854-1939), he was the author of "Flora der Schweiz", a work on Swiss flora that published over several editions from 1900 to 1923.

Vic Delmore

Victor "Deacon" Delmore (October 21, 1917 in Dunmore, Pennsylvania – June 10, 1960 in Scranton, Pennsylvania) was an umpire who worked in the National League from 1956 to 1959. His professional umpiring career began in 1948 in the KITTY League. He worked in the Southern Association from 1949 to 1955. From 1935 to 1942, he pitched in the minor leagues. 
Delmore was involved in one of baseball history's weirdest plays. It occurred during a game played on June 30, 1959, between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. Stan Musial was at the plate, with a count of 3-1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Delmore called ball four, however Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Tony Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out. The Cardinals filed a protest, but since they won the game, the protest was moot. Thus the play stood - the only known occasion in major league baseball in which two balls were in play at the same time.
Delmore's contract was not renewed for the 1960 season. Less than a year after the incident, Delmore died at age 42.

Qurbān-ʻAlī Khālidī (, 1846-1913) was a Kazakh historian, focusing mainly on the history of the eastern Kazakh steppe. His works are important sources for the history of Kazakhstan and Xinjiang.
Khālidī was born in Ayagoz, Kazakhstan, to a Chala Kazakh family, though he referred to himself as a "Noghay" - a Volga-Ural Muslim, or Tartar, as his father was a native of the Kazan area. His mother was a native of Ayagoz. He studied in several madrasas, first in his hometown of Ayagoz, then in Semipalatinsk, Lepsi, and Bukhara. By 1871 he attained the rank of imam, and by 1874 was the imam of a mosque in Tacheng.
Khālidī's writings utilize several Turkic languages, including Tatar, Ottoman Turkish, Chagatai, and vernacular Kazak. As such, studying and translating his works can be difficult for even experienced scholars.

Mario Kopić (born 13 March 1965) is a philosopher, author and translator. His main areas of interest include: History of Ideas, Philosophy of Art, Philosophy of Culture, Phenomenology and Philosophy of Religion.
Kopić is influenced by and write extensively on Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, Gianni Vattimo, Reiner Schürmann and Dušan Pirjevec. He also translated works by Nietzsche ("Thus Spoke Zarathustra", "On the Genealogy of Morality"), Giorgio Agamben, Gianni Vattimo, Jacques Derrida and Dušan Pirjevec into Croatian.
Life and work.
Mario Kopić was born in Dubrovnik, Croatia. He studied Philosophy and Comparative Literature at the University of Zagreb; Phenomenology and Anthropology at the University of Ljubljana; History of Ideas at the "Institute Friedrich Meinecke" at the Free University of Berlin (under the mentorship of Ernst Nolte); and Comparative Religion and Anthropology of religion at the Sapienza University of Rome (under the mentorship of Ida Magli).
Mario Kopić's philosophical work is under the influence of the Italian philosophical approach known as "pensiero debole" or "weak thought", the political thought of Arendt, and the ethical-political thought of late Derrida.
In his latest works "The Unhealable Wound of the World", "The Challenges of the Post-metaphysics", "Sextant" and "The Beats of the Other" Kopić developed a kind of onto-politics of conservative postmodernism and the post-anthropocentric humanism. For him, world is the space of being as event, and only then the arena of national and social or political conflict. The world, or existence, is our ontological responsibility, which precedes political, judicial and moral responsibility.
Kopić appears in Igor Ivanov Izi's 1995 film N.E.P.

Tropical Storm Maysak (2008)

Tropical Storm Maysak (international designation: 0819, JTWC designation: 24W, PAGASA Name: Quinta-Siony) was recognised as the 19th tropical storm by the Japan Meteorological Agency. It was also recognised as the 24th tropical depression and the 22nd tropical storm by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season.
Meteorological history.
On November 5, 2008, a tropical disturbance formed in the Philippine Sea to the northeast of Zamboanga in the Philippines. Later that day whilst the disturbance moved towards the north-west, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed the disturbances chances of forming into a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as "Poor". Early the next day as the disturbance was moving closer to the Philippines, PAGASA designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression Quinta. Later that day the JTWC upgraded the disturbances chances of becoming a significant tropical cyclone to "Fair" and then to "Good" as they released a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing disturbance. The Japan Meteorological Agency then designated the disturbance as a minor tropical depression, at the same time the JTWC designated the tropical depression as 24W.
On November 7 after the JMA had designated the minor tropical depression as a full tropical depression, the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm with the JMA assigning the name Maysak. The next day PAGASA released their final advisory on tropical storm Quinta (Maysak) as it had moved out of PAGASA's area of responsibility, this came as both the JTWC and the JMA reported that Maysak had reached its peak wind speeds of 60 mph (95 km/h) 10-Min sustained & 70 mph (110 km/h) 1-Min sustained. This meant that the JMA considered Maysak to be a severe tropical storm at its peak whilst on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale Maysak was considered to be a tropical storm.
Later that day Maysak recurved and started moving towards the south towards PAGASA's area of responsibility. The next day before Maysak re-entered PAGASA's area of responsibility, the JMA reported that Maysak had weakened into a tropical storm and then into a tropical depression, and released their final full advisory on Maysak. However the JTWC were reporting at this time that Maysak was still a tropical storm. Maysak then moved back into PAGASA's area of responsibility later that day, at this time PAGASA thought that Maysak was still a tropical storm. The JTWC downgraded Maysak to a tropical depression and released their final advisory early on November 10. PAGASA also downgraded Maysak to a tropical depression at this time however they kept issuing warnings until early the next afternoon when they released their final advisory on Quinta.
On November 12, PAGASA started to reissue advisories on Quinta, however they renamed Quinta as Siony. The JMA were also still monitoring Siony as a minor tropical depression at this time, whilst the JTWC assessed Maysak's remnants chances of regenerating into a significant tropical cyclone as fair. Later that day the JTWC upgraded the remnants chances of regenerating as good and released a tropical cyclone formation alert. Later that day PAGASA released their final advisory on tropical depression Siony as it had moved out of their area of responsibility and was moving towards Vietnam in the west. Late the next day the JTWC cancelled the tropical cyclone formation alert as they had reassessed Maysak chances of forming into a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as poor. Early the next day the JMA released their final advisory on tropical depression Maysak whilst later that morning the JTWC declared that Maysak had dissipated.
Preparations and Impact.
Philippines.
As PAGASA declared that Tropical Depression Quinta had formed, they put Public Storm warning signal No.1 up for parts of Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao. This meant that wind speeds of 30–60 km/h were expected within 36 hours. Later that day PAGASA put some more areas of Luzon under Signal 1 and cancelled the signal over parts of Mindanao Later on November 6 PAGASA kept revising the areas under Signal No.1 in Visayas & Luzon. PAGASA then cancelled all signals for Visayas Later that day as Quinta moved away from the Philippines. Early the next day PAGASA cancelled all off the signals for Luzon as they released their first final advisory on Qunita.
On November 12, the Philippine National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) reported that over 4800 people were affected by tropical storm Maysak. The NDCC reported that a total of 92 homes were either partially or totally destroyed in the Philippines. Sixteen of the municipalities in the Philippines reported power interruptions from November 6 until November 7. In total 19 people were killed by Maysak and 14 people injured.
Vietnam.
The remnants of Maysak lead to flooding rains in Vietnam which left at least 11 people dead. Flood waters in Ho Chi Minh City were estimated to be at least a metre (3 ft) deep.

A Zero Waste Event (or "ZeeWee" as it has been nicknamed) is one in which event organizers plan ahead to reduce solid waste from the event, reuse various elements such as banners, and set up Zero-Waste Stations for those recyclable and compostable materials such as paper cups, food scraps, and plastic water bottles that are generated by the event. ZeeWees can range from large scale sports events to weddings and parties.
Background.
As sustainability becomes ever more accepted as a concept within organizations and communities across the nation, the idea of Zero Waste Events is spreading. Additionally, the steady expansion of recycling and commercial composting infrastructure makes it possible to offer recycling and food composting at events in many locations.Increasingly Zero Waste Events are sharing best practice and developing new ways to send zero waste to landfill

L&amp;YR Class 7

The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) Class 7 was a class of Atlantic passenger steam locomotives to the design of John Aspinall. Forty were built between 1899 and 1902. They were known as "High-Flyers" as a result of having a high-pitched boiler that was supposed to increase stability at speed. All passed into London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) ownership on the grouping of 1923, becoming the LMS's only atlantic tender engine class. The LMS gave them the power classification 2P. Withdrawals started in 1926, and the last was withdrawn in 1934. None was preserved.
Numbering.
The locomotives were built in two batches of 20 at Horwich Works. The first batch, turned out in 1899, were numbered 1400, 1392–9, 1401–4, 700, 702, 708, 711, 718, 735, 737; the second batch of 1902 were numbered 1405–24. Those numbered in the 700s took the numbers of older locomotives which had been withdrawn; the others were given numbers at the end of the L&YR list which were as yet unused. Under the LMS, they were allocated the numbers 10300–39 in order of construction, but several were withdrawn before these numbers could be applied.
Details.
No. 737, the last locomotive of the first batch, is believed by John Marshall to have been the first British superheated locomotive. The front tubeplate of the boiler was recessed, creating a cylindrical space into which the superheater was mounted. This consisted of a drum long through which were a number of tubes for the hot gases to pass through. It offered only a low degree of superheat – above the normal steam temperature. The last five locomotives of the 1902 batch, nos. 1420–4, were given the same apparatus when new, but it was removed from all six by 1917.

The National Liberation Committee ( - CLN) was the underground political entity of Italian Partisans during the German occupation of Italy in the last years of the Second World War. It was a multi-party entity, whose members were united by their anti-fascism. Among the members were Ferruccio Parri, Sandro Pertini, Luigi Longo, Ivanoe Bonomi, Edgardo Sogno, Giovanni Gronchi, Nicolò Carandini and Enrico Mattei.
It was created by the Italian Communist Party, the Italian Socialist Party, the Partito d'Azione (a republican liberal socialist party), Democrazia Cristiana (the Catholic party), the Labour Democratic Party and the Italian Liberal Party, took control of the movement, in accordance with King Victor Emmanuel III's ministers and the Allies.
The partisan formations, which were controlled by CLN, were eventually divided between three main groups, the communist Garibaldi Brigades, "Giustizia e Libertà" Brigades (related to Partito d'Azione), and socialist Matteotti Brigades. Smaller groups included Catholic sympathizers and monarchists (like the "Green Flames", "Di Dio" and "Mauri"), and some anarchist formations.

Park Church

Park Church runs the length of an entire city block in Elmira, New York. The church was constructed from 1874 through 1876, replacing its much smaller, wooden predecessor. It was designed by Horatio Nelson White. The design of the limestone and brick church is highly ecelectic. Besides its architecture, the church is significant for its congregation of abolitionists and humanitarians. From 1854 until his death in 1900, Thomas Kennicott Beecher was the pastor of Park Church. Beecher, together with his twelve siblings including author Harriet Beecher Stowe, was brought up by liberal reformist clergyman Lyman Beecher.

Mayhurst

Mayhurst is an 1859 Italianate mansion in Orange, Virginia. It was built by the Willis family relatives of President James Madison as the plantation house for an estate comprising of fields, pastures and forest. It was a scene of action in the Civil War. It is currently operated as an Inn.
History.
Mayhurst was completed in 1860 by Colonel John Willis, a great-nephew of President James Madison. Colonel Willis acquired Mayhurst, then and during his lifetime known as Howard Place, from the estate of Charles P. Howard in 1856.
During the winter of 1863-64 when the Army of Northern Virginia was camped in Orange County, Lieutenant General A. P. Hill had his headquarters in the yard at Mayhurst. The Mort Künstler painting "Tender is the Heart" is set at Mayhurst.
During Reconstruction the house was occupied by the family of Federal Judge Hiram Bond and his son Marshall Latham Bond was born there.
Architecture.
Mayhurst is a frame two-story structure set on an exposed brick basement with an attic level lighted by small windows in the eaves and circular windows placed in each of the four cross-gables of the hipped roof. The roof is surmounted by two large chimneys and a central belvedere. This belvedere reflects the roof shape which surrounds it and completes the total pyramidal massing with an elaborate finial. The entire exterior wall surface above the brick basement is covered by wooden drop siding cut to resemble ashlar stonework. The deep, overhanging eaves are emphasized by the placing of oversized paired brackets, with their undulating curves and pendants, around the entire roofline.
The three-bay main facade (north) features a central entrance porch with an elliptical-arched fanlight and sidelights framing the double doors. On the second level, twin-arched windows which open to the balustraded porch roof visually support the circular window above, set in the cross-gable. At either side of the central porch and window bay on the first level are also twin-arched windows with hood molds and shallow balconies. On the second level of the two end bays are three-sectioned windows in the Palladian motif. The east and west facades are similar, both being four bays wide and having arched windows. On the east front, however, a five-sectioned oriel bay was placed on the first story which is partially blocked by a frame wing added circa 1912. The rear (south) facade has been partially obscured by shallow wings and a sleeping porch.
On the interior, the broad central hall is divided at midpoint by a graceful elliptical arch which rests at either side on piers alluding to the Doric order in detail. The stair which ascends along the east wall of the hall and curves at the beginning and end of each flight, develops exceptional rhythm of design due to the repetition of the octagonal-shaped and turned balusters, two to a tread. In addition, the scrolled, uncarved brackets on the step ends and the fascia board on the landings increase the activity of the design, making the stairway the finest single piece of woodwork in the house.
Two rooms flank the hall on both sides and offer a calm contrast to the stair by featuring broad, flat window and door framings as well as black marble mantels with arched openings and subtle curving lines in the shelf. The southeast room has been partitioned into several smaller rooms, including a kitchen. Although most doors have a pair of small rectangular panels below the lock rail with two tall ones above, variations occur with the lower panels being octagonal while the upper panels have arched tops.
An old structure to the rear appears to date from the first quarter of the nineteenth century due to some remaining architrave door framings and doors, the brick noggin walls, and the 6'-10" wide fireplaces on both ends of the two-story, hipped roof building. This house is believed to be the original Howard dwelling.

California State Personnel Board

The California State Personnel Board (SPB) is one of the California agencies responsible for administration of the merit-based civil service employment system for California state agencies, the other being the California Department of Personnel Administration. The board administers selections for state job openings and civil service exams. The SPB’s authority to enforce the civil service statutes is set forth in Article VII, section 3 of the California Constitution. Staff positions in the Supreme Court of California, the California Courts of Appeal, the California Legislature, the University of California, and the California State University are not administered by the board.
Some have questioned decisions made by the Board, citing cases like the Board's order to rehire a nurses's aide who removed money from an elderly man's drawer in a police sting prompted by thousands of dollars in thefts from the veteran's home in which she worked, as well as favorable decisions in the cases of doctors their peers considered unsafe around patients, and a psychiatric technician who hit a patient with his shoes.

Kill, Baby, Kill

Kill, Baby, Kill (Italian: Operazione paura) is a 1966 Italian horror film by director Mario Bava. It is known under many titles including "Curse of the Dead", "Curse of the Living Dead", "Don't Walk in the Park", "Kill, Baby... Kill!" and "Operation Fear".
Plot.
In a turn-of-the-century Carpathian village a series of murders are occurring in which the victims are found with silver coins embedded in their hearts. The coins are revealed to be talismans placed on the victims by the town witch (Fabienne Dali), meant to ward off the supernatural powers of the aged Baroness Graps (Giana Vivaldi). The baroness has been performing these duties for the ghost of her murdered daughter, who wants to claim the villagers' souls. In order to free the village from the curse, Dali must find the sequestered baroness and destroy her.
Critical reception.
Slant Magazine called it "arguably Bava's greatest achievement", giving it four stars out of a possible four. Allmovie called the film "an eerie and atmospheric effort that reflects many of the elements that have made the popular Italian director's films so compelling: excellent cinematography and strong performances from the talented cast."

<doc id="20116828" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20116828" title="Apple Writer">
Apple Writer

Apple Writer is a word processor for the Apple II family of personal computers. It was created by Paul Lutus and published in 1979 by Apple Computer.
History.
"Apple Writer 1.0".
Paul Lutus wrote "Apple Writer" alone in a small cottage he built himself atop a hill in the woods of Oregon, connected to the electricity grid with of cable strung in trees. The original 1979 version of "Apple Writer" ran from a 13-sector DOS 3.2 diskette and supported 40-column text display. It displayed text entirely in uppercase, but case could be toggled by pressing the ESC key; characters that the user signified as uppercase appeared in inverse (black on white) capitals, while characters in lowercase appeared as standard capitals. The names of the binary files "Apple Writer 1.0" produced began with the prefix "TEXT".
An undocumented feature was its ability to print to printers using a game paddle port as a serial interface. Users had to build their own serial cables; the risk of damage to the computer or printer was why Apple did not publicize the information, but Lutus documented the feature in a letter to "BYTE".
"Apple Writer 1.1".
Released in 1980, "Apple Writer 1.1" took advantage of DOS 3.3 and ran under the newer 16-sector format. It also featured a spellchecker known as Goodspell and some minor bug fixes.
"Apple Writer II".
"Apple Writer II" was released in 1981 and like its predecessor ran under DOS 3.3 on an Apple II Plus. Unlike the original, "Apple Writer II" could display both upper and lower case characters and, with a Sup'R'Terminal card in slot 3, could support both 40- and 80-column text. It also wrapped text too long to appear on the current line (rather than breaking it mid-word) and included a glossary and the Word Processing Language (WPL), a macro-like resources that allowed certain tasks to be automated. "Apple Writer II" files saved as standard text files rather than the older binary files.
"Apple Writer ///".
This program was released in 1982 for the Apple ///, and was able to use the enhanced capabilities of the Apple ///.
"Apple Writer IIe".
Released in 1983, "Apple Writer IIe" took advantage of the Apple IIe's built-in 80-column display and full keyboard and featured the ability to create larger files, print files to disk and directly connect the computer keyboard to a printer for typewriter-like operation.
"Apple Writer 2.0".
"Apple Writer 2.0" was released in September 1984 and was the first version of the series to run under ProDOS. It allowed users to set screen margins and to connect the computer's keyboard to a modem, allowing it to be used as a rudimentary terminal program.
"Apple Writer 2.1".
Published in late 1985, this version corrected a problem with parallel printer cards present in 2.0 and changed printed characters from low-ASCII to high-ASCII, correcting an issue with certain interface cards and printers.
Freeware.
Following the success of "AppleWorks", Apple discontinued the "Apple Writer" series. Creator Paul Lutus agreed in 1992 to make his program available on a freeware basis: it could be copied freely and given away, but could not be sold for a profit.
Interface.
Apple Writer used inline commands, so formatting did not appear on screen, but would appear when the document was printed. Paragraph formatting was specified with dot-commands, each of which required its own line. For example,
Character formatting was specified with escape-commands, which varied depending on the printer. Common commands included Esc-X to begin underlining, and Esc-Y to end underlining.
Reception.
"Compute!"s reviewer wrote in 1980 "I have looked at other text editors for the Apple, some of which were overloaded with features. Given the hardware limitations of the Apple II, I feel that Apple Writer is a very useful document creation tool", and stated that he wrote the review with Apple Writer.

B.o.B

Bobby Ray Simmons, Jr. (born November 15, 1988), better known by his stage name B.o.B, is an American hip hop recording artist, songwriter and record producer from Decatur, Georgia. In 2006, B.o.B was discovered by Brian Richardson, who then brought him to TJ Chapman, who then brought him to American record producer Jim Jonsin. After hearing his music, Jonsin subsequently signed B.o.B to his Rebel Rock Entertainment imprint. A couple of years later, Jonsin and B.o.B signed a joint venture deal with Atlantic and American rapper T.I.'s Grand Hustle Records.
B.o.B quickly rose to fame after his commercial debut single "Nothin' on You", reached number one in both the United States and the United Kingdom. He would later release his third single "Airplanes", which also topped several music charts. His fifth single "Magic", became his third top ten hit on the "Billboard" Hot 100. B.o.B's debut studio album "", which was preceded by two extended plays (EPs) and several mixtapes, was released on April 27, 2010. The album reached number one on the US "Billboard" charts and was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Later that year, B.o.B was named the ninth "Hottest MC in the Game of 2010" by MTV, on their annual list.
B.o.B released his second studio album "Strange Clouds", on May 1, 2012. "Strange Clouds" spawned six singles, four of which charted exceptionally well internationally. The song "Strange Clouds", the album's eponymous lead single, became his fourth top ten hit on the "Billboard" Hot 100. The singles "So Good", "Both of Us" and "Out of My Mind", followed behind, with the former two being certified platinum by the RIAA. The album itself debuted at number five on the "Billboard" 200. His third album "Underground Luxury", was released in December 2013 and supported by the lead single "We Still in This Bitch". B.o.B is currently working on the Grand Hustle compilation album and is set to release an EP which will only include rock music, as well as a collaborative album with his Grand Hustle label-boss T.I., all in the near future.
Biography.
1988–2006: Early life and career beginnings.
Simmons was born on November 15, 1988 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He played the trumpet in his school band from elementary school through high school. Although his parents wanted him to continue his education, Simmons decided in sixth grade that he wanted to pursue a music career. His father, a pastor, disapproved of his son's choices until he realized that Simmons was using music as a form of therapy and a creative outlet. Simmons later reflected on his experience, saying, "They’ve always supported me. They got my first keyboard to make beats on and they helped me out getting equipment here and there. But it was kind of hard for them to really understand what I was really trying to accomplish." B.o.B attended Columbia High School in Decatur, Georgia.
After meeting his mentor and co-manager, B. Rich, in 2002 at 14 years of age, B.o.B sold his first beat to former Slip-n-Slide recording artist Citti for a song titled "I'm the Cookie Man". Meanwhile B.o.B felt he had made it: "I went and blew all of my money on fast stuff like a chain and ballin'. Soon I was broke again, but I learned two important things from it; make sure I save my money and that I was hooked on music." Back to square one, B.o.B continued performing at open mics and underground venues to perfect his craft. In 2006, because he was underage, B. Rich helped sneak B.o.B into Club Crucial, a night club owned by Atlanta rapper T.I.. There, B.o.B performed a song titled "Cloud 9", a self-produced, spoken word-like ode to marijuana. In attendance was producer and industry veteran, T.J. Chapman, CEO of TJ's DJ's. TJ Chapman agreed to co-manage B.o.B, which only a month later led to B.o.B's signing with Atlantic Records and subsidiary imprint Rebel Rock, run by Florida producer Jim Jonsin. His first single for Atlantic, 2007's "Haterz Everywhere", reached the top five of Billboard's Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop singles chart. Along with his solo production career, B.o.B is part of a production/rap group called HamSquad, along with Playboy Tre, DJ Swatts, DJ Smooth, Moss B, B-Rich and TJ Chapman.
2007–2008: Rise to fame and mixtapes.
B.o.B first began to gain major recognition at the start of 2007. The underground single, "Haterz Everywhere", featuring Wes Fif, gained the rapper recognition and peaked at No. 5 on the U.S. "Billboard" Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. A remix featuring Rich Boy was included in the video game "Fight Night Round 4", and a music video was later released for that version. Another single, "I'll Be in the Sky", was released in late 2008 reached No. 115 on the follow chart. About.com called the song a "smart, funky artrap and a strong prelude to his album" and included it at No. 13 on its subjective ranking "Top 100 Rap Songs of 2008". Incidentally, another song produced by Bobby Ray called "Generation Lost" listed alongside the song on the ranking at No. 32. This was followed by another single called "Don't Let Me Fall" which was more of an R&B song than the usual rap. He was also featured on T.I.'s album "Paper Trail" on the song "On Top of the World".
The same year, he appeared on the cover of "XXL" magazine along with Asher Roth, Charles Hamilton, and Wale as "Hip-Hop's Class of '09". In October 2008, B.o.B was featured on the cover of "Vibe" along with some of these same young musicians and was similarly identified as promising young talent. He has described his influences as "80's music, techno, rock, funk, even doo-wop...". B.o.B has also worked with artists such as British rapper Giggs. From 2007 to 2008 B.o.B released four mixtapes; "The Future" (2007), "Cloud 9" (2007), "Hi! My Name is B.o.B" (2008) "Who the F#*k is B.o.B?" (2008) and two extended plays; "Eastside" (2007), "12th Dimension" (2008).
2008–2010: Mainstream success and "The Adventures of Bobby Ray".
In late 2008, it was revealed B.o.B was included in "XXL"'s 2009 annual Freshman Class, and was featured on the cover alongside fellow up-and-coming rappers Asher Roth, Wale, Kid Cudi, Charles Hamilton, Cory Gunz, Blu, Mickey Factz, Ace Hood and Curren$y. In February 2009, B.o.B crafted an original song, titled "Auto-Tune", for . On May 16, 2009, B.o.B released a cover of Manu Chao's "Mr. Bobby" and revealed he wanted to be known mononymously as Bobby Ray while also claiming he was taking his music in a "new direction": "Now I go by the name Bobby Ray. Make sure you put Bobby Ray. I’m really going into a new direction – more free and not trying to live up to any particular genre. I don’t feel like I’ve been doing that. I don’t feel like I’ve been trying to fit in, but I feel even more free-spirited. I have more willingness musically. That’s all I’m about. I’m about guitars, chords and keyboards". On June 22, 2009, B.o.B released his fifth mixtape, appropriately titled "B.o.B vs. Bobby Ray". The mixtape, reminiscent of T.I.'s "T.I. vs. T.I.P." (2007), was mainly produced by Fury and B.o.B. The mixtape also included a song produced by Red Spyda, titled "Fly Like Me" and another titled "Put Me On" which is a remix to A Tribe Called Quest’s 1990 hit, "Bonita Applebum". Reebok used "Put Me On" in celebration of the "Reebok Classic Remix" collection. The track is available for download exclusively to customers who purchase styles from the Reebok Classic Remix collection, at Foot Locker stores nationwide.

Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbing 'em / I'll crash that fucking airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in / And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus / And won't stop until the cops come in". In response, on March 25, B.o.B released "No Future" a song in which he takes aim at the hip hop collective and their leader. In June 2011, it was revealed that B.o.B was featured and produced a song on Tech N9ne's twelfth studio album, "All 6's and 7's". The track, titled "Am I a Psycho?" features rapper Hopsin as well, who also seems to have issues with Tyler, the Creator. B.o.B also appeared on the official remix to Kesha's hit single "Blow". The remix was released to iTunes on May 17, 2011.

In an interview with Syracuse University’s The Daily Orange, B.o.B spoke of his second studio album for the first time. He went on to say "It's a more mature sound but nothing too experimental. It's a happy medium between the sound of "B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray" and the mixtapes, so everyone should be able to enjoy it. I'd say I'm 90 percent done with it right now, but the album title is still TBA." On September 23, 2011, B.o.B released a trailer, through his website, for the upcoming single "Strange Clouds". The trailer announced the single will be officially released October 3. The single leaked prior to the release date on September 25, causing the single to be released on iTunes on September 27.

While on set for the "Strange Clouds" music video, MTV interviewed B.o.B and confronted him of a rumor that he and T.I. are working on a collaborative album, B.o.B responded: "The joint album, it actually started as a joke. Tip would always refer to me as 'the Martian', and in one of his lyrics, he said, ‘It’s the man and the Martian,’ and we said, ‘Man that could be an album title.’ We kinda just played around with it. But it seems to be taking form in a very organic way." On December 1, 2011 B.o.B appeared on New York City's Hot 97 radio station and confirmed that he and T.I. are indeed working on a collaborative album titled "The Man & The Martian".
On December 22, 2011, B.o.B released a snippet of "Play the Guitar", a promotional single, featuring André 3000 and a sample of "Fancy" as performed by Drake, T.I. and Swizz Beatz.

The song, produced by Ryan Tedder, was released on February 21. In 2012 in an interview with PopCush, B.o.B expressed his desire to work with Kid Cudi, James Blake and Skrillex: "I would also like to work with James Blake. That’d be crazy. I think me, James Blake and Kid Cudi should do a song and it should be produced by Skrillex. I think the sky would fall if we did that song and the sky would come down to Earth and party with us.". On March 20, 2012, B.o.B released the second promotional single from "Strange Clouds" titled "Where Are You (B.o.B vs. Bobby Ray)". "So Hard to Breathe" was released as the third promotional single on April 17, 2012. B.o.B appeared on Haley Reinhart's debut studio album "Listen Up!" on the intro track "Oh My". "Strange Clouds", B.o.B's second studio album, was released May 1, 2012, to critical acclaim. The album debuted at No. 5, on the US Billboard 200, with 76,000 copies sold the first week.

The mixtape also spawned a single, with the release of the club banger, "We Still in This Bitch". In early December, B.o.B revealed to MTV plans to release a rock music-influenced extended play: "I’ve been holding back so much rock for so long. I have been performing with my band for a while, so I guess this is a real good canvas for me to paint on. No one’s really expecting anything so I can do what I want to do." He also spoke lightly on his third studio album as well: "My album is basically a continuation of "The Adventures of Bobby Ray" and "Strange Clouds". I feel like it kinda bridges the gap between where all my fans are and finally getting everybody up to speed on what my sound is and exactly where I’m going."
While filming the video for "Memories Back Then", in an interview with Rap-Up, B.o.B spoke on a series of projects including his third album, a rock EP, and the Hustle Gang compilation. Rap-Up TV caught up with Bobby Ray, where he stated his rock EP is in the works and will reflect his diverse influences: "When I drop it, everyone’s gonna have an eargasm. It’s really how I fell in love with rock music, from indie to alternative to classic rock to even some forms of country music.” He spoke of his third album, which is nearing completion: "This project is a lot more effortless than anything because I've really shown the full spectrum of what I can do musically, so now I’m just having fun with it. I’m 24 years old, so I’m partying." In March, B.o.B teamed up with fellow Atlanta rapper Big Boi, of OutKast, to release the official theme song for the 2013 video game ""; if pre-ordered the rappers were also playable characters. The song, titled "Double or Nothing", was accompanied with a music video directed and produced by Vice, Noisey and EA

On April 22, 2013 it was announced B.o.B would tour with fellow American rappers Wiz Khalifa, A$AP Rocky, Trinidad James, Joey Bada$$, and Smoke DZA, for the Under the Influence concert tour. The tour would then begin on July 17, 2013. On May 12, 2013 B.o.B tweeted: "Underground Luxury ... coming this summer... #staytuned", revealing the title of his third studio album. In May, B.o.B also premiered a music video for a newly released song of his titled "Through My Head". The video was directed by Peruvian film director Ricardo de Montreuil. On May 13, 2013 radio personality Funkmaster Flex premiered "HeadBand" (featuring 2 Chainz), the lead single from "Underground Luxury". The song would be released to retail on May 21, 2013. The song has since peaked at No. 65 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. B.o.B later revealed in an early September interview, that the album would be released in December 2013.
On September 10, 2013, the second single from "Underground Luxury", titled "Ready", was released to iTunes. The song, produced by Noel "Detail" Fisher", features fellow Atlanta-based rapper Future. In September 2013, B.o.B revealed he has plan to launch his own record label imprint. During an interview, he stated "I'm putting my CEO pants on, man. I'm finna start a label called HamSquad and I'm looking for artists to be the flagship artists for the label. So I'm really excited about that." In the same interview he announced "Underground Luxury", would be released in December.

On October 15, 2013 the music video for "Ready" was released. On October 17, 2013, during an interview on BET's "106 & Park", B.o.B announced that the album would be released on December 17, 2013.

Fat Chance (Lesléa Newman novel)

Fat Chance is a 1994 young adult novel written by Lesléa Newman. The book centers around a 13-year-old girl named Judi Liebowitz, who goes on a bulimic diet to try to lose weight. The novel was published by Putnam Press in 1994–2004 and by Scholastic from 2004–present.
Plot summary.
Judi Liebowitz wants to be the thinnest girl in eighth grade and have a boyfriend. She's convinced that if only she had "creamy thighs and amazing cheekbones that look like I'm always sipping through a straw" her best friend Monica wouldn't have stolen the boy she had a crush on. When Judi meets glamorous, thin as a stick (tiny as) Nancy Pratt, she thinks her life will turn around and she'll be gorgeous. Nancy teaches Judi the secret she uses to staying thin, binge-purge thinking this will somehow help. Judi is thrilled she can "have her cake and eat it, too and she won't gain weight." But then, something dreadful happens to Nancy Pratt because of her eating disorder and she ends up in intensive care. Judi really doesn't want the same thing to happen to her but she just can't control her disorder and the worst part is, she can't or doesn't want to tell anyone, not even her own mother. This is no easy thing to cure and it's no joke for Nancy or Judi, it's a matter of Life or Death.
Reception.

Edward Lynn Johnson (born March 2, 1981 in Newport Beach, California) is a professional American and Canadian football punter who is currently a free agent. He most recently played for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League. He was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the sixth round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He played college football at Idaho State.
Johnson has also been a member of the Cincinnati Bengals, New York Giants, Jacksonville Jaguars, Washington Redskins, Denver Broncos, Detroit Lions and Toronto Argonauts.
Early years.
Attended Newport Harbor High School in Newport, California. There he became a three-year letter-winner, averaging 42.3 yards per kick as a senior, and earning all-state, all-county, and All-Sea View honors.
College career.
Began his college career at Orange Coast College, where he lettered as a kicker and backup quarterback for two seasons. Averaged 38 yards per punt as a freshman (1999) and over 40 yards per kick as a sophomore (2000). Had one of the finest NCAA seasons by a punter, earning first-team All-America in 2001, as he led the nation with a 46.3-yard gross average with a net of 44.3. Posted a 45.7-yard average in 2002 with a long of 80 yards, adding eight touchbacks and 15 punts inside the 20. Also handled kickoff duties for the Bengals and recorded touchbacks on nearly 75 percent of his kickoffs. He also majored in sports medicine.
Professional career.
Minnesota Vikings (2003-2004).
He was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings 180th overall in the 2003 NFL Draft. Johnson showed a lot of promise after showing exceptional leg strength and posting good results throughout mini-camp, training camp, and the pre-season. Once the regular season began, however, Johnson's play became very inconsistent and erratic as he struggled getting the ball away like he had in college. After 14 games, he was benched in favor of veteran Leo Araguz. 
After an inconsistent rookie season, Johnson was put into a competition for the punting job against veteran Darren Bennett the following off-season. He was noted for developing a funky hitch in his step during mini-camp, something neither he nor his coaches knows how he developed the bad habit. Though he posted good numbers, Johnson lost the battle and was subsequently released July 23, days before training camp started.
Cincinnati Bengals (2004).
He was claimed off waivers by the Cincinnati Bengals on July 26, but suffered an undisclosed injury a week into training camp and was waived August 23. He then had a tryout with the Kansas City Chiefs on August 30, but did not impress the coaches and wasn't signed.
New York Giants (2005).
Was signed by the New York Giants on January 21. He was then allocated to NFL Europa for the 2005 season. Johnson was released March 23 from the Giants.
Jacksonville Jaguars (2005).
Johnson was signed to a 1-year deal by the Jacksonville Jaguars on July 17 and competed for the job against Chris Hanson. He was released August 30.
Washington Redskins (2006).
On August 29, Johnson signed a contract with the Washington Redskins. He was suddenly released from the team later that same day after one practice.
Denver Broncos (2007).
He signed a contract with the Denver Broncos on January 2. After Todd Sauerbrun signed a contract to rejoin the team, Johnson was waived.
Detroit Lions (2008).
The Detroit Lions signed Johnson to a contract on July 30 to compete with Nick Harris for the job. He made the final 53-man roster, but was waived after week 1.
Toronto Argonauts (2009).
On May 29, 2009, Johnson was signed by the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League and competed with fellow new import kicker Justin Medlock for the kicking spot vacated by the retirement of Mike Vanderjagt. At the end of training camp, the Argos elected to keep both kickers and coach Bart Andrus elected to start Johnson for game one and placed Medlock on the practice roster. Johnson, however, was injured on the opening kickoff when he separated his shoulder when tackling the return man and Medlock was slated to kick for game two of the 2009 Toronto Argonauts season.
On May 11, 2010, Johnson was released by the Argonauts.
Saskatchewan Roughriders (2010-11).
On July 22, 2010, Johnson was signed by the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League to compete with incumbent punter, import Louie Sakoda for the kicking spot after Sakoda's poor performance in the previous week's game against the Edmonton Eskimos. Johnson was awarded the start against the Calgary Stampeders for the July 24, 2010 matchup. Late in the 2010 season, Johnson became a popular personality in rider nation owing to his sense of humour in interviews and the novelty he built up around his moustache; during Grey Cup week, fans were seen sporting fake moustaches and custom-made jerseys bearing Johnson's number 11 and the name "Slick Eddie", the punter's popular nickname, on the back. He played in six games in 2011 before being sidelined with a nagging injury. He was eventually placed on the nine-game injured list and sat out the rest of the season. Johnson was released on December 13, 2011.

Illinois's 5th congressional district special election, 2009

A special election was held in Illinois's 5th congressional district in 2009 to fill the seat vacated by Rahm Emanuel. On April 7, Democratic nominee Michael Quigley defeated Republican nominee Rosanna Pulido and Green nominee Matt Reichel. Quigley was sworn in on April 21 and will serve out the current congressional term.
Emanuel officially resigned from the House of Representatives, effective January 2, in a letter to his constituents and Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Emanuel was named White House Chief of Staff by incoming President-elect Barack Obama. Emanuel was first elected to Congress from Illinois's 5th congressional district in 2002. His resignation followed being re-elected to a fourth term.
The governor's office announced that a special primary election would be held on March 3 and special general election would be held on April 7. State law requires the governor to set a date for a congressional special election within five days of a vacancy being created. State law mandates that a general election must be held within 115 days of the vacancy. In an effort to cut costs and help save money, the date of the special general election coincided with municipal elections scheduled in Chicago, Cook County, and surrounding metropolitan areas.
There were 24 candidates representing three political parties in the March 3 special primary election. The Democrats had 13 candidates; the Republicans had six candidates; and the Greens had five candidates.
Quigley, a 50-year-old Cook County commissioner, won the Democratic Party's primary with 22% of the vote. He defeated a strong field of Democrats, including state representatives John Fritchey (District 11) and Sara Feigenholtz (District 12), physician Victor Forys, and Chicago City Council alderman Patrick J. O'Connor (40th Ward).
Pulido, a Mexican-American and director of the Illinois Minuteman Project, won the Republican Party's primary with 25% of the vote. She defeated a handful of local businessmen, including Tom Hanson, David Anderson, Gregory Bedell, Daniel S. Kay, and Jon Stewart.
Reichel, a 27-year-old activist and political operative, won the Green Party's primary with 34% of the vote. He defeated four other candidates for the party's nomination. Reichel's margin of victory over fellow Green Party nominee Deb Gordils was extremely small—only 11 votes. Reichel won with 166 compared to Gordils' 155.
Nearly a month after the primaries, the three candidates took part in the April 7 special general election. Democratic Party candidate Michael Quigley defeated Republican Party candidate Rosanna Pulido and Green Party candidate Matt Reichel. Quigley won with 30,561 votes (69.2%); Pulido had 10,662 (24.2%) and Reichel had 2,911 (6.6%).
The election did not receive a great deal of coverage, due to the district's heavy Democratic lean. The Republican Party did not put up a top-tier candidate, acknowledging that they were not even focusing on the race This is highlighted in the fact that the Republican nominee was the founder of an anti-illegal-immigration group, running in a district that is one-quarter Hispanic. The real fight was for the Democratic nomination, which would almost assure being elected to Congress. In fact, over 12,000 more votes were cast in the Democratic Primary than there were in the general election.

Pont de Pierre (Aosta)

The Pont de Pierre (), meaning "Stone Bridge", is a Roman segmental arch bridge in the Italian city of Aosta in the Aosta Valley. The bridge crossed the Buthier about 600 m from the eastern exit of the Roman colony Augusta Praetoria; in later times the "torrente" changed its course, leaving the ancient bridge today without water.
The single-arch bridge has a span of 17.1 m and a width of 5.9 m. The arch vault consists of large voussoirs and shows a comparatively flat profile (span to rise ratio 3:1). The facing was built of pudding stone, the spandrels filled with Roman concrete.
The structure is dated to the second half of the reign of Augustus (30 BC–14 AD), who had earlier founded the military colony Augusta Praetoria at an important road junction (24 BC). The Pont de Pierre was of particularly strategic importance, since in Aosta the transalpine routes to Gaul branched off into the Little St Bernard and the Great St Bernard Pass. In southeasterly direction towards the Po Valley, the road led over another segmental arch bridge, the excellently preserved Pont-Saint-Martin Bridge, located at the exit of the Aosta valley.

Sammy Taylor (baseball)

Samuel Douglas "Sammy" Taylor (born February 27, 1933 in Woodruff, South Carolina) is a former Major League Baseball catcher who played from 1958 to 1963 for the Chicago Cubs, New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds and Cleveland Indians.
Signed by the Milwaukee Braves in 1956, Taylor was traded with Taylor Phillips to the Cubs for Eddie Haas, Don Kaiser and Bob Rush on December 5, 1957. He made his big league debut on April 20, 1958 against the St. Louis Cardinals. Appearing as a pinch hitter for Gene Fodge, he drew a walk in his first plate appearance. Overall, Taylor appeared in 96 games in 1958, hitting .259 with 78 hits, six home runs and 36 RBI.
In 110 games in 1959, Taylor hit .269 with 13 home runs and 43 RBI in 110 games. His 13 intentional walks were the fourth most that season. Taylor was involved in a rather peculiar situation in a game on June 30 of that year, between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. Stan Musial was at the plate, with a count of 3–1. Pitcher Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, however Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. To Anderson's disappointment, the ball flew over Tony Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.
Taylor slumped in 1960, hitting only .207 in 150 at-bats. He lost his starting catching role that year and played in only 74 games.
He was the team's second most used catcher in 1961, behind Dick Bertell. In 1961, he hit .238 with eight home runs and 23 RBI in 235 at-bats (89 games).
He began the 1962 season with the Cubs, hitting .133 in 15 at-bats with them. On April 26, he was traded to the Mets for Bobby Gene Smith. In 68 games with the Mets, he hit .222 with three home runs and 20 RBI. Overall, he hit .214 in 173 at-bats that season.
In 1963 - his final season - Taylor played for three different teams. He began the year with the Mets and hit .257 in 41 at-bats with them. On July 1, he was traded with Charlie Neal to the Reds for another catcher, Jesse Gonder. He played in three games for the Reds, collecting no hits in six at-bats. On August 1, he was traded to the Indians for Gene Green. He collected three hits in 10 at-bats for the Indians. Overall, he hit .235 with no home runs and seven RBI in 51 at-bats. He played his final game on August 6. 
Overall, Taylor played six years in the majors, hitting .245 with 33 home runs and 147 RBI in 473 games.

Leningrad Rock Club

The Leningrad Rock Club () was a historic music venue of the 1980s in Leningrad, situated on Rubinstein Street in the city center. Opened in 1981 and overseen by the KGB, it became the first legal rock music venue in Leningrad. Overall, it was the largest rock scene in the Soviet Union, which featured such bands as Kino, Alisa, Aquarium, Zoopark, Piknik, Automatic Satisfiers, DDT, NEP, Grazhdanskaya Oborona (formally), and became an important influence on the Russian rock music.
History.
Leningrad had long been a center of rock music in the Soviet Union, perhaps due to its geographical proximity with Finland, which made it easier to access Western music. Attempts to create rock clubs began as early as 1973, but they were largely unsuccessful.
The Leningrad Rock Club formed in 1981 under Leonid Brezhnev. It was intended to be organized similarly to the Union of Soviet Composers and censored lyrics and issued permits to perform in an effort to prevent the bands from making much that was too controversial. However, by providing musicians with a place to meet, perform, and discuss their music, the club provided an unprecedented amount of creative freedom and helped lead to the Russian rock revolution. The club effectively closed in 1991.
There were restrictions on which bands could perform at the club for most of its history, and groups had to audition before a commission. Additionally, the club was monitored by the KGB, the Communist party, and the Komsomol Communist Youth Organization. More radical bands, such as the highly political Televizor and punk singer Svinya, were banned from the club. However, these restrictions lessoned in 1987 under Mikhail Gorbachev.
Influence.
The Leningrad Rock Club provided access to a new, Western form of music for an audience of unprecedented size in the Soviet Union. It led to an emergence of a rock industry in the Soviet Union. Its performers began to tour, perform on television, and have their songs played on the radio. This was part of a growing prominence of Western culture in the Soviet Union.
However, some musicians disliked the mainstream fame and acceptance the Leningrad Rock Club brought them. "We are so official now, so taken to heart, that the people who were with us before are not sure of us," Boris Grebenshchikov of Aquarium said in an interview with the New York Times. "Nobody can believe that the system has changed. They think we must have changed." The Leningrad Rock Club was viewed by some artists as a sign of compliance with the Soviet government.

<doc id="20117307" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20117307" title="Izzat Darwaza">
Izzat Darwaza

Muhammad 'Izzat Darwaza (; 1888–1984) was a Palestinian politician, historian, and educator from Nablus. Early in his career, he worked as an Ottoman bureaucrat in Palestine and Lebanon. Darwaza had long been a sympathizer of Arab nationalism and became an activist of that cause following the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire in 1916, joining the nationalist al-Fatat society. As such, he campaigned for the union of Greater Syria (modern-day Levant) and vehemently opposed Zionism and foreign mandates in Arab lands. From 1922 to 1927, he served as an educator and as the principal at the an-Najah National School where he implemented a pro-Arab nationalist educational system, promoting the ideas of Arab independence and unity. Darwaza's particular brand of Arab nationalism was influenced by Islam and his beliefs in Arab unity and the oneness of Arabic culture.
Later, Darwaza co-founded the nationalist Istiqlal party in Palestine and was a principal organizer of anti-British demonstrations. In 1937, he was exiled to Damascus as a result of his activities and from there he helped support the Arab revolt in the Mandatory Palestine. He was incarcerated in Damascus by French authorities for his involvement in the revolt, and while in prison he began to study the Qur'an and its interpretations. In 1945, after he was released, Darwaza eventually compiled his own interpretation entitled "al-Tafsir al-Hadith".
In 1946, he joined the Arab Higher Committee led by Haj Amin al-Husseini, but resigned the next year after being disenfranchised by al-Husayni's methods. He left for Syria afterward and briefly aided in the unity talks between Syria and Egypt in the mid-1950s. By the time of his death in 1984, Darwaza had written over thirty books and published numerous articles on the Palestinian question, Arab history, and Islam.
Biography.
Early life and background.
Darwaza was born to a middle-class Sunni Muslim mercantile family in Nablus. The Darwaza family had long been involved in textiles and had extensive trade relationships with merchants in Beirut and Damascus. In his memoirs, Izzat writes "The import of goods from the outside was, for the most part, through Beirut and Damascus." Izzat's father, 'Abd al-Hadi Darwaza and his paternal grandfather Darwish Darwaza, owned a store in the Khan al-Tujjar of Nablus. Izzat recalled, "From what I remember from my father and through my grandfather, the title merchant or merchants in Nablus mostly referred to owners of commercial textile and cloth shops. In Nablus, these shops were confined, or mostly confined, to a caravansary called Khan al-Tujjar, in the middle of Nablus."
Izzat received elementary and preparatory education in Ottoman government-run schools in the city. In addition to Arabic, he learned Turkish and English, as well as a basic knowledge of French which he strengthened in by the end of his formal education. Darwaza left school without going to Istanbul or Beirut to finish his education as was the custom of his generation. Instead, he educated himself, and according to Rashid Khalidi, became "a self-taught intellectual."
Loyalty to disloyalty toward the Ottoman Empire.
Originally, Darwaza supported the Ottoman Empire based on his feelings of identification with Islam and of belonging to the larger Ottoman Muslim "ummah" ("nation"). In 1906, he served in the local Ottoman administration as a clerk in the Department of Telegraphic and Postal Services (DTPS) in Nablus. His first assignment in that department was for the District of Beisan and northern Palestine (the Galilee and northern Samaria). He was also an Arabist and was enthusiastic about the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, expecting that the new Ottoman regime would grant the Arabs their legitimate demands (i.e. reforms and autonomy within the framework of the empire, rather than total independence).
His loyalty to the Ottomans eroded, however, due to the impact of the new regime's Turkification policies which he viewed as repressive against his ideals. Because of his dissatisfaction with the Young Turks, Darwaza was driven to support Arab independence from the empire. In 1908, he joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), but withdrew soon after because of its pro-Turkish views and ideals. He played an active role in establishing a branch for the Party of Harmony and Freedom in Nablus in 1911. The party was originally founded in Istanbul and joined by Arab members to counter the policies of the CUP. In 1913, he joined a Nablus-based anti-Zionist; the group sought to prevent the sale of Arab-owned land to Jews by submitting petitions to the Ottoman sultan or by purchasing land for sale so that it could not be bought by Jews. In June 1913, he helped to prepare and became secretary of the First Palestinian Congress (also known as the Arab Congress of 1913) in Paris. In congress, he was also the delegate for the Jamma'in subdistrict of the District of Nablus. Meanwhile, Darwaza was still working in the DTPS.
In 1914, he established the Arab Scientific Society whose purpose was to spread Arabic culture in the region through the establishment of Arabic schools. The society did not succeed, however, due to the outbreak of World War I. Within the DTPS, Darwaza was appointed commissioner and deputy for the Nablus Post Office. He was promoted again—this time as director of postal stamp sales in Beirut.
Promoting unity with Syria.
During World War I, Darwaza served as Postal Directorate-General of Beirut and retained this post until 1918. In 1916, while serving with the Ottoman army in the Sinai Peninsula, he joined the underground al-Fatat organization through Ahmad Qadri, a high-ranking member from Damascus. The aim of al-Fatat was to liberate and unite the Arab lands under Ottoman rule. In the wake of the Arab Revolt of 1916, Darwaza left the Ottoman civil service to serve in King Faisal's provisional government in Damascus. Ideologically, Darwaza became an Arab nationalist endorsing the concept of a single Greater Syrian Arab State.
Following the World War I Armistice, Darwaza held several important political posts including Secretary-General of al-Fatat from May 1919 to March 1920, Secretary of the Nablus Muslim-Christian Association, and Secretary of the First Palestinian Arab Congress in Jerusalem in 1919. During the spring and summer of 1919, a vigorous political campaign was waged by the Arab politicians in Palestine who were divided into "Younger Politicians" and "Older Politicians". The campaign was centered on the political future of Palestine and Darwaza, a Younger Politician, played a central role. The Younger Politicians consisted of Arab nationalists who sought to unite Palestine with King Faisal's Syria while the Older Politicians consisted of Palestinian nationalists who preferred that Palestine be an independent entity.
Darwaza and Hafiz Kanaan—another leading al-Fatat member from Nablus—lobbied Arab groups in Jerusalem to advocate Syro-Palestinian unity before the arrival of the King-Crane Commission on 10 June 1919. They first met with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Kamil al-Husayni of al-Nadi al-Arabi party and they immediately expressed their support. They also suggested that Darwaza meet Raghib al-Nashashibi, Hussam ad-Din Jarallah, and Aref al-Dajani, supporters of independence. Darwaza convinced Nashashibi to gather some of the Older Politicians of Jerusalem to a meeting at his house. When it was made clear that Musa al-Husayni, a leader of the Older Politicians, was now in favor of unity, all of the other Older Politicians followed suit. When the commission arrived in Jaffa, it concluded on 27 June that it was in favor of Syro-Palestinian unity under a British Mandate.
In the first week of July 1919, the Syrian National Congress held its first meeting in Damascus and Darwaza was its secretary. The GSC called for the immediate independence of Syria as a sovereign state under a constitutional monarchy and underlined its opposition to the establishment of Zionism in southern Syria (Palestine). Along with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Aref al-Aref, Darwaza founded and became an officer of the Palestinian Society in Damascus. The organization urged all societies and clubs in Palestine to cooperate and condemn the San Remo Conference's decision to grant Great Britain a mandate over Palestine and Transjordan.
Darwaza's and the Younger Politicians' hopes for unity with Syria were curtailed when it became known that King Faisal was aligning himself with the leaders of the Zionist movement because "they Zionists were helping us Arabs in the Peace conference." Darwaza now believed King Faisal was someone who did not give Palestine the attention he thought it deserved. Faisal was deposed by the French in July 1920. An event that further deteriorated Darwaza's ambitions of Arab unity was the confirmation of the British Mandate over Palestine at the San Remo Conference on 24 April 1920. His experience in Damascus revealed to him that the universalism of Arab nationalism was not as concrete as its advocates had thought, and the military might of the colonial powers—France and Great Britain—were an overwhelming force to contend with.
Educator in Nablus.
Darwaza continued his political activity, representing Nablus in the Fourth Palestinian Congress in May 1921 and the Seventh Palestinian Congress in June 1928. From 1922 to 1927, he served as the principal of the an-Najah National School (later to become an-Najah National University) where he initiated and nurtured an Arab nationalist political educational process. Darwaza wrote textbooks and was an educator himself. One of his students who later became a nationalist politician, Akram Zu'aiter, wrote that Darwaza "used to give us a weekly lesson on the principles of Nationalism and society, in a way which sharpened our thought and broadened our horizons." Zuaiter also recalls that Darwaza wrote up nationalist and historical plays that his students would perform in.
In 1927, Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim, the leader of the Young Men's Muslim Association of Haifa, a prominent merchant, and future associate of Darwaza, invited him to his home to speak a large group of students and notables about nationalist ("qawmiyya") and patriotic ("wataniyya") education. This was recognition that Darwaza's contribution to the spread of Arab nationalist sentiments gained influence not only in an-Najah school, but throughout Palestine.
Fight against the British Mandate.
Darwaza became a member of the Arab Executive Committee and in 1930 was appointed by rival nationalist Haj Amin al-Husseini (now the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) as the General Administrator of the Waqf (Islamic religious trust) under the Supreme Muslim Council. In 1931, he convinced his city's MCA to change its name to the Patriotic Arab Association. Unlike other Arab politicians at the time, Darwaza supported a combination of pan-Arabism, Islamism, and dedication to the Palestinian nationalist ideal.
He began to edit in the "al-Ja'miyya al-Arabiyya" newspaper in the early 1930s and in December 1931-January 1932, he wrote articles encouraging Arabs to fight British policies in the Middle East, to unite in the face of growing dangers, and to renew their drive towards freedom and independence. In August 1932, he along with Awni Abd al-Hadi and others founded the Istiqlal (Independence) party in Palestine, an offshoot of al-Fatat. Originally, the Istiqlal operated in Syria, then Transjordan, but reassembled in Palestine after facing disappointing circumstances in both those territories. The party coaxed Palestinians towards defying British rule by staging demonstrations and political and social boycotts. Darwaza refused to allow the Istiqlal to participate in meetings between local Palestinian political parties and the British high-commissioner. Darwaza wrote an article on 21 June 1933, vehemently attacking Palestinian "vested interests". He argued that the wealthy Arab notables of Palestine were subservient to the British and the Zionists and would willingly leave Palestine for other countries, while the poor and middle-class Arabs had to remain to fight and die in their battle against British oppression. Darwaza helped instigate and organize the 1933 demonstrations in Jaffa which protested British policy in Palestine and continued Jewish immigration.
Darwaza was one of the principal organizers of the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine which first erupted in his hometown of Nablus with the launch of the Palestinian general strike. Along with Abd al-Hadi, Darwaza was arrested by the British authorities in June and imprisoned in the military camp at Sarafand al-Amar. The Mufti sent a delegation consisting of Darwaza, Mu'in al-Madi, and Abd al-Hadi to Baghdad, then to Riyadh to discuss the situation and upon their return on 6 January 1937, they revealed that the advice given to them was to cease hostilities. During the revolt, in 1937, Darwaza was exiled from Palestine by British authorities to Damascus. Later in that year, Darwaza held several meetings with Nuri al-Sa'id of Iraq to explore various solutions to help the Arabs avoid appearing intransigent.
Despite attempts to calm the situation, in Damascus, Darwaza established and headed the Central Committee for National Jihad in Palestine which echoed Izz al-Din al-Qassam's call for a holy war against the British and Zionism. Darwaza had many encounters with al-Qassam, describing him as "a man lacking in arrogance or self-love. He was open and available to all of the people and the people loved him. And he lived the life of a "mujahid"." Darwaza worked closely with the Mufti, who was now under house arrest in Beirut, to garner support and supplies for the revolt and supervise the Arab rebels in Palestine.
In late 1939, he was accused by French military authorities of helping Palestinian rebels in the revolt, tried by a military court, and sentenced to five years imprisonment in the Citadel of Damascus. While his exile by the British abruptly curtailed his political life, his imprisonment marked the beginning of a new life wherein the Quran becomes a major concern for the next several years. He was released in November 1944. After his release, Darwaza was unable to return to Nablus because British authorities had issued an order preventing him from entering Palestine. As a result, he left for Turkey, mostly staying in Bursa until the end of 1945.
The Mufti re-established the Arab Higher Committee (AHC) in late 1946 and Darwaza joined the ten-member council upon a request from the Mufti. Darwaza, along with Emil Ghuri and Mu'in al-Madi, served as the AHC's delegates to the September 1947 convention of the Arab League's Political Committee in Lebanon. With support from the Transjordanian representative, Salih Jaber, the Prime Minister of Iraq, openly criticized the delegates and questioned the AHC's right to even send delegates to the convention. Later that year, Darwaza resigned from the AHC due to the Mufti's unbending attitude towards wider representation.
Later life.
After resigning from the AHC, Darwaza spent the rest of his life in the modern state of Syria where he left politics to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960s. As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and Egypt forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After Egypt adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.
In 1983 Darwaza granted Palestinian historian Muhammad Y. Muslih an eight-day interview and allowed him to photo-copy his memoirs in entirety. Muslih noted that Darwaza was failing in health at the time. He died in Damascus in 1984 at the age of 96. Darwaza had three daughters, Najah, Salma, and Rudaina and a son, Zuhair.
Literary works.
One of the first modern histories of the Arab nation in contrast to a history of an individual Arab country was composed by Darwaza in the late 1920s under the title "Lessons of Arab History: From Antiquity to Present Times". In the book, Darwaza begins by describing the origins of the Semitic peoples, the rise of Islam, the end of Arab rule in the Middle East by Turkic groups, and the foreign rule over the Arabs by Western powers. The book was intended to be used as a textbook in primary and secondary schools throughout the British Mandates of Palestine and later Iraq, hence its simplified and direct language, however, it had a pioneering role in the development of pan-Arabism.
In 1934, Darwaza published a widely read story, "The Angel and the Land Broker", reflecting popular Arab sentiments against the growing "Zionist threat" and attacking brokers who tempted Palestinian land owners to sell their land to Jews. The story describes methods used by Zionists to entice Arab landowners to sell their land and the main characters in the story are an illiterate farmer and a Jewish girl from Tel Aviv who encourages the former to spend himself deep into debt, forcing him to sell his land at a price far below its value.
Later in his lifetime after leaving politics, Darwaza published memoirs that discussed in detail the city of Nablus in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to Youssef Choueiri, "he gives a graphic and almost exhaustive description of his hometown... its mosques, residential quarters, orchards, industries, and inhabitants. Moreover, he dwells at length of the social composition of the town endeavoring to reveal the open conflict between 'feudal families' and the new generation of middle traders, functionaries, civil servants, and teachers."
Quranic studies and interpretations.
While he was imprisoned in Damascus, Darwaza was provided with an opportunity to read and reflect upon the Quran. He states "I considered opportunity an act of divine and started reading whatever books of exegesis and qur'anic studies were accessible to me." During his incarceration, he compiled three books dealing with the Quran and conceived the idea of writing a modern "tafsir" ("interpretation").
His time in Turkey exposed him to the libraries of Bursa and it was there where he wrote the rough draft of his "tafsir" entitled "al-Tafsir al-Hadith". Darwaza states in this exegesis he would "uncover the wisdom of revelation, the fundamental concepts of the Qur'an and the whole range of its subject matter and present it in a new style and new sequential order." "Al-Tafsir al-Hadith" was generally aimed at the Muslim youth who had been alienated by the traditional interpretations of the Quran. Darwaza placed much emphasis on the close relationship between the text of the Quran and the environment in which it was revealed. He rejected the "hadith" which states the Qur'an was originally preserved on a tablet in the seventh heaven, sent down to lowest heaven and from there gradually to Muhammad.
After the completion of the rough draft, he wrote a volume of four chapters, "Qur'an al-Majid", which served as an introduction for the "tafsir". Darwaza stresses a close connection between the Quran and the biography of the Muhammad ("sira") and states that the Quran fully reflects various stages between the Quran and the career of Muhammad. He also emphasizes that both the angels and the "jinn" are spoken in the Quran not for their own sake, but to reinforce Muhammad's missions and goals.
He contends that the presentation of the Quran and its "suras" was dictated by Muhammad and that the task of Abu Bakr was to collect the Quran between its two covers and transcribe it into one copy, while Uthman's task was to fix the transcription and unify it to prevent variant readings. He also expresses doubts that Ali, as it is alleged, had made a chronologically arranged collection. Darwaza was very critical of other modern interpreters who used certain verses of the Quran to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues that those people have done harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of the Quran.
Darwaza was convinced that interpretations of the Quran were the only possible basis for any renewal and development of Islamic religious, political and social thought, and that the Quran was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms in Islam and Islamic thinking. Since it was quite uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole "tafsir"—which Darwaza did—he had to justify his position by seeking a "fatwa" from the muftis of Aleppo and Damascus.
Legacy.
Throughout his life, Darwaza was an Arab nationalist and supported the unity of Syria and Palestine. His particular brand of Arab nationalism was influenced by Islam, his belief in Arab unity, and the oneness of Arabic culture. According to his perspective, the ideology's main points were the Arabic language, the Arab homeland, a shared Arab history and common Arab interests. Although Darwaza believed that Arab nationalism pre-dated Islam, he also maintained that Islam expanded Arab territory and "stamped them with the eternal mark of Arab nationalism." According to Muhammad Y. Muslih, this meant that Islam had provided Arabs with "spiritual, cultural, and legal unity and within the framework of that unity the Arab individual formed his moral and social beliefs, irrespective of where he lived and through it the Arabs were able to preserve national identity and maintain their culture in the face of foreign invaders, including the Ottomans". Darwaza contends that Arab nationalism is not a new concept borrowed from the West and asserts the constituents of Arab nationalism are stronger than those which make up the modern forms of nationalism in the world.
His ideas helped the spread the word of secular pan-Arabism against religious nationalists and those who believed in separate Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian destinies. In the mid-1950s, Darwaza asserted that the first stage of Arab union should be based on a merger between Egypt and Syria. In his opinion, a union between the northern Arabs (Syria) and the southern Arabs (Egypt) would facilitate the adherence of other Arab states. He believed that Egypt's capabilities and human resources compelled it to fill the role of an Arab "Prussia". Darwaza remarked on Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egyptian president and founder of the short-lived union, saying "Since the Arab revolt against the Turks, no Arab leader has been up to the level of events except for Jamal 'Abd al-Nasir. He emerged and vanished like a shooting star."
Rashid Khalidi states about Darwaza, "Moved as he was by the civilization of Arabs, he evoked a distant Arab past. For obvious reasons Islam was central to that past. But in the case of Darwaza, Islam was important not as the binding substance of the nation, but as a culture and civilization. In other words, culture, language, and history not religious solidarity were posited as the glue that was to hold the Arab nation together." According to Khalidi, Darwaza contributed to Arab nationalism in the practical and intellectual domains greatly.

Il Mare Calmo della Sera

Il mare calmo della sera is the debut album released by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, following his win of the Sanremo Festival in 1994, singing his first single and the leading single of the album of the same name. It was certified Gold in the Netherlands.
It was followed by the releases of "Bocelli", his second pop album, which topped charts all over Europe, in 1995.
History.
In 1992, Bocelli's first break as a singer came when Italian rock singer Zucchero Fornaciari auditioned tenors to record a demo version of "Miserere", which he had co-written with U2's Bono. Successfully passing the audition, Bocelli recorded the tune as a duet with Pavarotti, with whom he became very close friends, even singing at his second wedding, and funeral. After touring all over Europe with Zucchero in 1993, Bocelli was then invited to perform at the "Pavarotti & Friends", held in Modena in September 1994.
Bocelli was then signed to Sugar Music by Caterina Caselli, who persuaded him to participate in the Sanremo music festival. He eventually won the newcomer section of the competition in 1994, with "Il mare calmo della sera", a song written by Zucchero for him.
After the Festival, Bocelli released his first studio single also titled "Il mare calmo della sera". The single was also included in both of Bocelli's Greatest hits albums, "Romanza" in 1997, and "" in 2007.

Hossak worked at his father's grocery business until establishing his own business, a leather tannery. That enterprise was destroyed in the massive Quebec City fire of 1845 after which Hossak returned to selling groceries.
After retiring from business and travelling through Europe and Egypt, Hossak returned to Quebec City and became a city councillor in the St Louis ward for eight years until his appointment as the city's Mayor in November 1869. However, Hossak was unable to legally maintain the Mayor's chair because of his residency outside the city and therefore left office within two months.
In 1888, Hossak continued to contribute to public life as Chair of the Protestant Board of School Commissionners, the Vice-President of the Literary and Historical Society and the President of the Quebec City Mission. He was a member of the city's Chalmers Church serving as Treasurer in the late 1880s.

<doc id="20117365" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20117365" title="Steve Rifkind">
Steve Rifkind

Steve Rifkind is an American music entrepreneur who is, according to "XXL" magazine, "responsible for breaking in some of hip-hop’s biggest artists in his 25 years in the business". Rifkind was the founder and chairman of Loud Records as well as the founder and current chairman and CEO of SRC Records. He is associated with artists such as Wu Tang Clan, Mobb Deep, Akon, David Banner, Asher Roth, Tha Crow, Joell Ortiz and Big Pun. Rifkind has also launched marketing campaigns for companies like T-Mobile, Adidas, SanDisk and Chief Executive Air, a charter jet company .
Origins.
The son of Spring Records' Jules Rifkind, Steve found an early affinity to R&B and Rap music growing up in Merrick, Long Island. The elder Rifkind ran the R&B label in the 1960s and 1970s, whose clients included James Brown and Millie Jackson. In his youth, Steve worked for his father at Spring, even working as a promotion man on "King Tim III (Personality Jock)" by the FatBack Band in 1979. Widely regarded as the first rap song ever recorded (it beat Sugarhill Gang's Rapper's Delight into record stores by weeks). After leaving Spring Records, Rifkind re-located to Los Angeles where he managed the R&B group New Edition from 1986-1988.
Loud Records.
As the CEO and founder of Loud Records in 1991, Rifkind positioned himself as a major tastemaker in a new era of hip hop music and culture. Designed as a bi-coastal hip-hop label focused on "street-themed" hip-hop, Loud was influential in launching the careers of several hip-hop stars in the early and mid-1990s; most notably the Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep, Three 6 Mafia, and Big Punisher. With Loud, Rifkind used the techniques he had developed at SRC to bring his artists success in branding and cross-promoting themselves. Among others, Loud's holdings included a film division and a clothing line.
Loud's success led to Rifkind's selling 50% of the company to RCA in 1996. In July 1999 Loud moved to Sony. Loud launched its film division in 1999, signing a multi- year pact with Dimension/Miramax. Loud Film's first and only project, "Paid in Full" (a film on which Brett Ratner, Jay-Z, and Damon Dash were partners with Rifkind) was released in 2002.
The New Millennium.
Today Rifkind is still deeply involved in the hip-hip and R&B world. After losing the Loud records name after a sale to Sony in 2002, Rifkind started Street Records Corporation (a second SRC). Early artist signings included platinum-selling southern rapper David Banner, as well as R&B singer Akon. In 2003, Rifkind joined the Universal/Motown Records group as Vice President.
In 2007, Rifkind acquired limited rights to the Loud Records name from Sony and released the Wu-Tang Clan's "8 Diagrams" under the Loud banner.
Along with operating SRC, and his ever expanding roster of corporate clients, Rifkind's latest ventures include investments in Coalition Music Group, a Reggaeton label, as well in Kid's Block, an educational DVD series for children featuring music by the Trackmasters production team. 2008 saw the foundation of the Rifkind Thal Group (RTG), a technology marketing company. Its first client is SanDisk a data storage products inventor and manufacturer.
In the near future, SRC plans to release records from its new R&B artists Tami Chynn, Shontelle, Melanie Fiona, and Shiré.
The Street Team Concept.
The Street Team promotional model as pioneered by Steve Rifkind is based on the simple principle of word of mouth advertising coupled with the touchstones of what makes "urban cool.” The street team is fundamentally based on knowledge of the urban subculture on the part of the marketer and what the potential consumers relate to. "Nobody should put out a record before they know what the street thinks." Says Rifkind.
The main promotional techniques used by members of a street team mirrors the hip-hop subculture of graffiti. This can include posting bills or stickers in areas that are not designated for them or hard to reach places, or stenciling spray painted images or messages in high traffic urban areas. Other common street team practices include giveaways of promotional products (CDs, T- shirts, posters, etc.) at events (shows, basketball games, hip-hop battles, etc.) "We create the biggest buzz we can by building it one step at a time" said Rifkind.
By focusing on the trendsetters of urban cool culture; the rappers, DJs, and street hustlers, and knowing the best places to promote their artists (clubs, on college radio, street corners, record stores, at shows, etc.), Rifkind and SRC were able to make inroads into urban markets that many mainstream advertisers had a hard time getting to. "You can't reach America's youth with off the mark radio ads or insulting television commercials," Rifkind has said.
Philanthropic Efforts.
Aside from his numerous business ventures, Steve Rifkind is involved in several philanthropic activities. Camp Excel, founded in 1996 with childhood friend, Psychologist, Dr. Gary Altheim, is a week-long overnight camp for underprivileged children struggling with learning disabilities.
Steve also sponsors and coaches the Delray Blazers, his son’s youth basketball team, in Del Ray Beach, FL. In 2008 they won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) Florida state championships.
Rifkind is also a sponsor of breast cancer charities, donating the profits from his “Think Pink Rocks” concerts to breast cancer research and treatment. The first “Think Pink Rocks” event in September 2008 was hosted by Queen Latifah and featured several SRC Records artists.
Other Recent Endeavors.
Steve Rifkind signed on as investment partner and marketing consultant of Chief Executive Air, a private jet company based out of New York City.

Henry Clay Crawford

Henry Clay Crawford (1856–September 23, 1929) served as Secretary of State of Florida from 1902 to 1929, succeeding his father John Lovic Crawford, who served from 1881 to 1902, upon his death. He was a Democrat. H. Clay Crawford held several jobs before becoming chief clerk to his father. Appointed Secretary on January 28, 1902, after his father's death, he was nominated and reelected to that position until his own death.
He wrote his memoirs in 1914, mainly about the founding of Crawfordville, Florida (the county seat of Wakulla County) and the post-Civil War Reconstruction in the county. 
According to the State Archives of Florida, "Crawford claimed that the town was named in 1866 in honor of his father who was then the state senator for Wakulla. He recounts the names and activities of the earliest of Crawfordville's inhabitants and names those who have died and those who remain. His depiction of Reconstruction politics is told from the point of view of a southern Democrat and accuses the Republicans of malfeasance in office. He recounts a riot taking place at the courthouse and the assassination of one of the Republican ringleaders. This is a short work and it seems that it may perhaps have been prepared for publication in a newspaper of the era."

Alina is the second novel, published in 2006, by Northern Ireland writer Jason Johnson. When the eponymous character, an online sex worker or "cam whore", disappears, two mismatched travelling companions leave Belfast for Romania to find her.
The story addresses the abnormality of the underworld relationship between the post-communist east and capitalist west within Europe in the 21st century. It has been described as an exploration of "Ceauşescu's regime via allegory."
Plot summary.
Henry Sender discovers that a website he has inherited is an outlet for eastern European webcam operatives, selling themselves live online to customers around the world. As he begins to explore his potentially new career as a webmaster, he "meets" one of his clients, Alina, who rents time on the portal and has a string of disconcerting customers. As an email relationship builds, she suddenly stops communicating and no longer appears online. She had told Henry earlier that she was planning to meet one of her customers in real life.
Suffering from a bipolar disorder and bouts of paranoia, timid Henry hires a bodyguard, Shuff Sheridan, to travel with him to Romania in order to track down Alina. As Sheridan loosens up along the way, he begins to engineer violent episodes as the men travel from Belfast to London, and from Bucharest to Iaşi. Hard drinking Sheridan picks violent fights with random strangers while consistently consoling a panic stricken Henry by telling him that he is his Protector.
Meanwhile, Alina meets her customer, Gadaka, in the flesh and he takes her to an apartment he has hired in the city of Iaşi. He explains that he will pay her the large and agreed sum, but that she will have to be his sex slave for eight days. As Alina begins what she hopes will be her final sordid encounter, it appears that Sheridan and Sender simultaneously embark on a night out in the same town during which a Russian mafia enforcer is killed.
Back home in Belfast, elderly Francis Cleary is dying while locked inside a steel box. Unable to escape, he thinks back on his times as a maverick philosophy lecturer and how Sheridan was his most eager student.
After escaping a brutal confrontation in Iaşi, Sheridan and Sender make it to Alina's home address. They find her hanging, having committed suicide some days before. An unsent file on her computer reveals that she had wanted to send a suicide note to Henry. The message suggests that Alina had been unable to live with the shame after what she had been through. Gadaka had cheated her out of the money he had promised to give her.
While searching through her PC, Henry finds that Gadaka is trying to communicate with him. Gadaka outlines what he had done to Alina as he watches Henry seated beside her corpse on Alina's webcam. As their conversation tumbles into depravity, Henry tricks Gadaka out of a fortune in minute-per-minute webcam fees before challenging Sheridan, who has just returned, bloodied, from another bar.
As Henry learns news of the now deceased Francis' fate back home, and that Sheridan is wanted for imprisoning the old man in an empty oil tank, he comes close to shooting his bodyguard. Ultimately he allows Sheridan to sleep, instead choosing to carry Alina to an historic nearby cathedral. He leaves her at the feet of St Paraskevi, Protector of Iaşi.
Henry leaves Romania soon after, resolute that he has been somewhere close to Hell and that he must begin an escape from his past personality and his recent life. As Sheridan awakes and makes his way back home, he is arrested in London and imprisoned for life for the murder of philosopher Francis Cleary.
Reaction.
Alina received a mixed reception, with critics tending to either rate it highly or dismiss it altogether.
The UK's "Independent on Sunday" said it was "ambitious but flawed"
American author and critic Frank Sennett said Alina "delivers a climax as harrowing as one might hope to find in contemporary crime fiction."

Karbala Ta Karbala

Karbala Ta Karbala is a collection of Marsias, or more appropriately Marasi, by Waheed Akhtar, a noted Urdu poet and critic. He also wrote Ghazals and nazms and an epic, "Shahr-e Hawas", which is considered his magnum opus. "Karbala Ta Karbala", which means 'Karbala to Karbala,' has eight collection of marasi or elegies/dirges. They are written in traditional format of Marsia, that is Musaddas, which became standard after great masters of Urdu poetry, Anis and Dabir. Each marsia in "Karbala ta Karbala" deals with the life, exemplary qualities and martyrdom of the hero of the marsia. Every marsia in the collection has more than 100 bunds which is a unit of marsia in the format of musaddas. The theme and heroes of his marasi are the people, who died in the battle of Karbala on tenth of Muharram in the year 61 AH (October 10, 680 AD) along with the grandson of Muhammad, Husayn ibn Ali, or who belonged to Muhammad's household-Ahl al-Bayt.
Waheed Akhtar's marasi are different form other masters of Marsia in the treatment of the theme of marsia. His poetry writing attains its greatness in his marsias. It demonstrates his command of language, richness of ideas, his vast diction, his power of narration. It also reflects his aptness of writing poetic drama. His marsias deal with social, ethical, political and philosophical and many contemporary issues related to man and society. In general they are mirrors of his philosophy, ideas, and values he advocated and wrote throughout his life.
Karbala and Husayn, which is the central theme of these marsias, is also a leitmotif or a recurring motif in Waheed Akhtar's other poetic genres. All his marsias show his yearning for human freedom, truthfulness, uprightness of character, and constant struggle against injustice, oppression, human exploitation, to attain freedom and peace. To demonstrate that he very deftly uses the personality of Husain and his associates and other Ahl al-Bayt like Ali and Fatima. In his one marsia he praises speech and language as an important attribute of God, and denounces silence as a symbol of hypocrisy, opportunism, timidity and approval of injustice. The last Marsia in this book is different from others, in the sense that it is a call to those associates of Husain and probably to all of humanity who started their journey with the intention of joining Husain's cause, but could not reach Karbala on the day of Ashura. This call is from Zainab, Husain's sister, who is calling them for help to carry on Husain's mission, and to uphold the cause whose inheritors are the women and children of Husain's family and his only surviving son, Ali ibn al-Husayn. In his marsias Husain is the symbol of peace, freedom and the epitome of sacrifice in the divine cause of upholding the values of humanity. The journey which started early in the author's life during ceremonies of Muharram, according to his own admission in his foreword to "Karbala Ta Karbala", comes full circle with the message conveyed by the last marsia of the collection:
Karbala tak aake palto bhi to jaoge kahan, Jis taraf jaoge hoga karbala maujood waan<br>
Karbala leta raha hai har qadam par imtehan, Hashr tak hoga hisab-e-dostan-o-dushmanan

The Leftovers (Australian band)

The Leftovers, are a Brisbane punk rock group which formed in 1976 in Queensland, Australia. Original band members were Warren Lamond on vocals, Ed Wreckage on guitar,Jim Shoebridge on guitar, Glenn Smith on bass guitar and Graeme ‘Hutch’ Hutchinson on drums. Constant members of the original band (1976-1979) were Lamond and Smith, whilst other members were replaced at various times by a host of others including Michael Hiron, Johnny 'Burnaway' Gorman, Mal ' Malcontent' Skewis and Ed Wreckage's son, Ché Wreckage, who joined the group in 2012 along with Michael Gilmore. The group existed from 1976 to 1979 with reformations in 1983 and 2012. 
According to music historian, Ian McFarlane, Brisbane produced "some of the most anarchistic bands of the Australian punk rock era" and that it was a city nationally renowned for its ultra conservatism. Ian McFarlane also mentioned the group's first and only single, which was released in 1979 and rates it as "as one of the classics of the late 1970s Australian punk rock era." 
The Leftovers had acquired local cult punk hero status in Australia over the years due to their acknowledged reputation in the past for excessive anti social practices, constant harassment by the Queensland Police Force and self-destructive deeds. Their musical style fitted the generic conventions of punk but they also paid live homage to earlier proto–punk influences such as Lou Reed and Patti Smith.
History.
Originally from Sandgate, Queensland, the band mostly played self promoted hall shows. Like The Saints, they encountered at these hall venues, the disproportionate attention of the law. “Many Leftover gigs were never finished – police would often pull the plug before they had a chance to get through a full set.” The Leftovers had been quoted as saying. Chris Spencer, compiler for the "Who's Who of Australian Rock" commented that they "Embodied the image of what Brisbane's visualization of 'punk' was all about. Raw, energetic and anti social and everything else that made the era fun, they captured the attention of fans, neighbours and the police.; The band managed to only release one seven inch E.P. in 1979. The A-side, "Cigarettes and Alcohol" is considered an Australian punk “classic.”
The band started out with members Warren Lamond on vocals, Jim Shoebridge on guitar, Glenn Smith on bass and Graeme ‘Hutch’ Hutchinson on drums but also had a plethora of other musicians filling in vacant roles. They included at various times Michael Hiron on drums, Johnny 'Burnaway' Gorman on guitar and Ed Wreckage, firstly on drums and then guitar. Some of these members went on to join up with The Riptides and The Pineapples from the Dawn of Time at various times. 
The group disbanded in 1979, Lamond and Wreckage going on to form the Temporary Ornaments. After the split, according to Ian McFarlane, a string of tragedies occurred from the band's ex-members that included suicide attempts (Warren Lamond), prison (Ed Wreckage) and premature deaths. The group members who've past away since are Warren Lamond, Glenn Smith, Michael Hiron, Johnny 'Burnaway' Gorman and Jim Shoebridge.
In 1985, they managed to reform for one live show featuring Warren Lamond on vocals, Ed Wreckage on guitar, Michael Hiron on bass and David Donald on drums. 
In 2012 the band reformed for a show called "Return to White Chairs", which featured various other local bands from the late 1970s to early 1980s. The Leftovers' line-up for this show was Ed Wreckage on Guitar, Graeme Hutchinson on Percussion, Michael Gilmore on Vocals and Ché Wreckage on Bass. The current line-up have continued playing live shows in Brisbane.
Legacy.
In 2003 a retrospective CD of Leftovers was released called "The Fucken Leftovers Hate You" was released by Dropkick Records as well as a re-issue of their 1979 vinyl record. The material on the CD included recorded songs including Patti Smith’s "Hermine" and a collection of live recordings. Songs from the original E.P., "Cigarettes And Alcohol" and "I Only Panic When There Is Nothing To Do" were included on several Australian CD compilations during the 2000s.

Charles Alexander Calvert

Charles Alexander Calvert (28 February 1828 – 12 June 1879) was a British actor and theatre manager noted for Shakespearean "revivals" featuring elaborate staging and historically accurate sets and costumes.
Early life.
Calvert was born in London on 28 February 1828, and educated at King's College School. On leaving it he spent some time in the office of a London solicitor and in a mercer's business in St. Paul's Churchyard; but before long he was drawn to the stage, having derived a first impulse towards it from the plays of Shakespeare produced at Sadler's Wells Theatre by Samuel Phelps, from whom Calvert afterwards modestly declared that he had learnt all his art.
Acting career.
He first acted professionally in 1852, at Weymouth Theatre, under the management of Edward Askew Sothern, famous for creating the role of Lord Dundreary. Then he played leading parts at Southampton and in South Wales, until in about 1855 he joined the company of Messrs. Shepherd and Creswick at the Surrey Theatre in London, where he played leading youthful parts of a "legitimate" type. A year after his arrival in London he married Adelaide Ellen Biddies, who went on to achieve some stage success in her own right as Mrs Calvert. They had eight children, of whom five (three sons and two daughters) followed their parents' profession, including Louis Calvert, their third son. 
In 1859 Calvert became stage-manager and principal actor of the Theatre Royal, Manchester. Five years later in 1864, by then manager of the newly built Prince's Theatre, Calvert began the series of Shakespearean "revivals" which were the chief efforts of his professional life. Convinced that Shakespeare could be "made to pay," he consistently produced plays with elaborate attention to scenery, costume, and every other element of stage effect. The Shakespearean plays "revived" by Calvert were the following:
From a draft in his handwriting it appears to have been his intention, had his connection with the Prince's Theatre continued, to crown the series by an arrangement of the three parts of Henry VI together with Richard III in three plays, under the title of "The Houses of York and Lancaster". Some of Calvert's less elaborate productions included Byron's "Manfred" (1867) and other plays by Skakespeare. He generally had a good "stock" company, in which several actors and actresses of mark received their training. The financial viability of the ventures he was associated with seems to have varied. The Prince's Theatre passed into the hands of a company in 1868 who quickly rebuilt it, allowing Calvert to fulfil his promise of providing "dramatic entertainment of the highest class". His connection with the theatre ended in 1875, shortly before which Calvert had staged a very successful production of Henry V in New York. After leaving the Prince's Theatre he produced, at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, "Henry VIII" in 1877. He also staged Byron's "Sardanapalus" at Liverpool and at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, and superintended a "replica" at Booth's Theatre in New York.
Later years.
His last years were migratory, spent at the head of a travelling company which appeared in Manchester and at other places. Towards the end the state of his health, which had given way four years previously, persuaded him to retire to Hammersmith, where he died on 12 June 1879. The genuine admiration felt for him at Manchester had been shown on the occasion of his first departure for New York by a public banquet (4 January 1875). His funeral at Brooklands cemetery, near Sale in Cheshire, was made the occasion of a popular demonstration. Later in the year (1 and 2 October) a benefit performance of "As You Like It" was staged in Manchester for his family.

Hell-Cat Maggie

Hell-Cat Maggie (fl. 1840–1845) was the pseudonym of an American criminal and early member of the Dead Rabbits. She was a well-known personality in Manhattan's Five Points district and a noted female fighter, her teeth reportedly filed into points and who wore long claw-like brass fingernails, who fought alongside the Dead Rabbits and other Five Pointers against rival nativist gangs from the Bowery, most especially the Bowery Boys, during the early 1840s. Although there is little information on her life, she is one of the earliest female criminals of the "Gangs of New York" era and has been compared to later criminals such as Sadie the Goat, Gallus Mag and Battle Annie, the latter leading the female auxiliary of the Gopher Gang during the 1870s. 
A composite character based on Hell-Cat Maggie, Sadie the Goat and Gallus Mag was played by Cara Seymour in the 2002 film adaptation of Herbert Asbury's "Gangs of New York" directed by Martin Scorsese. She was also featured in the 2003 historical novel "A Passionate Girl" by Thomas J. Fleming.

Johann Christian Friedrich Heidmann

Johann Christian Friedrich (Fritz) Heidmann (November 1, 1834 - June 30, 1913) was a German missionary and botanical collector who was born near Lübeck.
Trained as a glazier, Heidmann joined of the Rhenish Missionary Society in 1861, and as a member of the group began work as a missionary in Cape Colony in 1865. A few years later, he along with approximately 90 Baster families relocated to the deserted village of Rehoboth. At Rehoboth he would serve his congregation until his retirement in 1906.
During warfare between the Ovaherero and the Namaqua, Heidmann acted as mediator at peace talks between the Basters and Ovaherero, and in the early 1890s he worked closely with German authorities to secure Baster cooperation against Namaqua leader Hendrik Witbooi (1825-1905). 
In 1886 he was visited by Swiss botanist Hans Schinz (1858-1941), with whom Heidmann agreed to collect and ship botanical specimens from German Southwest Africa to Zurich. Schinz would later name the plant species "Crotalaria heidmannii" after him. Heidmann suffered from dementia later in life, and died in a mental institution near Cape Town.

Manada Gap, Pennsylvania

Manada Gap is an unincorporated community in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States, in the Harrisburg-Carlisle area, near Fort Indiantown Gap.
Fort Manada.
Distant about twelve miles from Fort Hunter is the passage through the Blue Range called Manada Gap, the next station in the chain occupied by the government. As in the case of Fort Hunter, the settlers about Manada Gap had already commenced a place of defense in the latter part of the fall of 1755. In February 1756, Captain Frederick Smith, with his company of provincials, cither completed the fort already commenced or erected a new one. This was called Manada Fort.
It was the ordinary block-house surrounded by a stockade. It stood on what is now the property of William Rhoads, east of the Manada Creek, about midway between it and the road to Jonestown, Pennsylvania and three-quarters of a mile south of the mill in Manada Gap. On the historical map it is located on the wrong side of the stream and rather too close to the mountain. Being of minor importance,or at least so considered, it was used only a couple of years. The exact location of this fort has never before been given.

Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation

The Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) is the agency charged with licensing and regulating businesses and professionals in the State of Florida, such as cosmetologists, veterinarians, real estate agents, hotels and restaurants and pari-mutuel wagering facilities. DBPR’s mission is to license efficiently, regulate fairly, and it strives to meet this goal each day. The Department is under the executive branch of the Governor and is governed by Chapter 120, F.S. The Department is structured according to the requirements of Section 20.165, F.S. On the Department’s website, consumers and licensees can verify licenses, file a complaint against licensed or unlicensed individuals, apply for or renew licenses, search food and lodging inspections, search for or request public records and read about recent Department initiatives.
DBPR has more than 1,500 employees and is headquartered in Tallahassee, Florida. DBPR licenses and regulates more than one million businesses and professionals in the state of Florida. In recent years, the Department has significantly reduced the average professional license processing time. In October 2008, the average was more than 41 days and at the end of 2012, the average was less than two days.
Office of the Secretary.
The head of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation is the Secretary, who is appointed by the Governor and is subject to confirmation by the Senate. There is no set term limit; the Secretary serves at the pleasure of the Governor. The Secretary is responsible for planning, directing, coordinating and executing the powers, duties and functions vested in the Department, its divisions, bureaus and other subunits. The current Secretary is Ken Lawson. Lawson has held the position since May 2011. 
A native Floridian, Lawson has spent more than a decade protecting the public in numerous public and private regulatory positions. 
Lawson is a graduate of Florida State University and the Florida State University College of Law.

Recent Department Improvements.
Division of Hotels and Restaurants: 2009 Food Code 
Effective January 1, 2013, the Division of Hotels and Restaurants adopted provisions of the 2009 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Code. The updates encompass more efficient and smarter regulations that improve the inspection process, ultimately helping operators better serve their customers.
For a copy of the entire 2009 Food Code, visit click here. 
One of the most important changes is a new three-tiered violation classification system that replaces the “critical” or “non-critical” classification. The new system uses the terms “High Priority,” “Intermediate,” and “Basic”—which better defines violation information for operators and consumers, making the process easier to understand. 
High Priority food service violations are those that could contribute directly to a foodborne illness or injury. High Priority lodging violations are those that could pose a direct or significant threat to the public health, safety, or welfare.
Intermediate food service violations are those that, if not addressed, could lead to risk factors that contribute to foodborne illness or injury. Intermediate lodging violations relate to specific actions, equipment, or procedures that contribute to a high priority violation if left unaddressed.
Basic violations are those considered best practices. To download a complete copy of the new food service violation classifications, click here.
If you are a food service or hotel operator and have any additional questions, you may call 850-487-1395 or visit your local District Office. Local district office locations can be found here.
Florida Building Codes and Standards
The Florida Building Commission was transferred to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation on July 1, 2011. Prior to that, the Commission was housed under the Department of Community Affairs.
The Florida Building Commission (Sections 553.76 and 553.77, F.S.) is a 25-member technical body responsible for the development, maintenance and interpretation of the Florida Building Code through a consensus-building process. The Chair is appointed by the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate, and serves at the pleasure of the Governor. Other Commission members appointed by the Governor represent architects, engineers, contractors, building owners, insurance, public education, local governments, building and fire officials and persons with disabilities. The Commission also approves products for statewide acceptance and administers the Building Code Training Program.
The Florida Building Code (Section 553.73, F.S.) replaced Florida's patchwork of codes and regulations that were developed, amended, administered and enforced by more than 400 local jurisdictions and state agencies with building code regulation responsibilities. The current Code is a single statewide code based on national model codes and consensus standards, amended for Florida specific needs for the design and construction of buildings. The Code is designed to make the local building process more efficient, increase accountability, bring new and safer products to the market, increase consumer confidence, and better protect the residents of this natural-disaster prone state.

Babatunde Lea

Babatunde Lea (IPA: Liː) is an American percussionist who plays Afro-Cuban jazz and Worldbeat. He took his name from Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji.
Biography.
Michael Lea was raised in Englewood, New Jersey, while regularly commuting to 116th and Amsterdam in New York, where the rest of his family lived after moving from his birthplace, Danville, Virginia. His aunt was one of the first women to play in a marching band. He began drumming at the age of 11, when he, without drumming experience helped a drumline get a rhythm right. That same year, his cousin took him to see Babatunde Olatunji and his "Drums Of Passion", and Olatunji's influence was so great that Michael took on his first name. At 16, he first participated in a professional recording session with Ed Townsend. In 1968, he moved to San Francisco, where he joined Bata Koto, led by Bill Summers. He joined a band called Juju, which relocated to Richmond, Virginia in the early 1970s.
In 1977, he moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area. Among the artists with whom he played were Stan Getz, Joe Henderson, McCoy Tyner, Randy Weston, Van Morrison, and Oscar Brown, Jr.. In 1993, Virginia and Babtunde Lea founded the Educultural Foundation, a California 501(c)3 educational non-profit organization based in Vallejo, California.
Returning east, he met up with Leon Thomas (who used to sing at the church Lea attended as a youngster, the First Baptist Church of Englewood) and became drummer in his band. This led to working with Pharoah Sanders. Lea would ultimately pay tribute to Thomas on his 2009 album, "Umbo Weti", which appeared on the Motéma Music label that he founded with Jana Herzen in 2003. His first album as leader, "Levels of Consciousness" was released in 1979. He recorded with a band called Phenomena, which grew out of the Loft Jazz Association. He did not release another, "Level of Intent", until 1996, putting it on his own label, Diaspora Records. He mortgaged his home to get the album released, but it was not widely distributed until Motéma reissued it in 2003. 
In 2010, Babatunde and Virginia moved to Pennsylvania to teach at Gettysburg College.
Says Lea of his work, "I strive to make my compositions functional, which is an African take on the arts. The purpose I try to imbue my music with is that our growth as human beings should strive toward an anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic, egalitarian, democratic universal society and I don't care how many life times it takes to get there! I consider myself an activist as well as a musician and consider myself an 'agent of change.'"
His work has been noted for its mixture of styles and influences.

<doc id="20117898" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20117898" title="Pyocyanin">
Pyocyanin

Pyocyanin (PCN-) is one of the many toxins produced and secreted by the Gram negative bacterium "Pseudomonas aeruginosa". Pyocyanin is a blue, secondary metabolite with the ability to oxidise and reduce other molecules and therefore can kill microbes competing against "P. aeruginosa" as well as mammalian cells of the lungs which "P. aeruginosa" has infected during cystic fibrosis. Since pyocyanin is a zwitterion at blood pH, it is easily able to cross the cell membrane. There are three different states in which pyocyanin can exist; oxidized, monovalently reduced or divalently reduced. Mitochondria play a huge role in the cycling of pyocyanin between its redox states. Due to its redox-active properties, pyocyanin generates reactive oxygen species.
Synthesis.
In order for pyocyanin to be synthesized by "P. aeruginosa", two specific genes must be functional. "MvfR" is a gene which produces a transcription factor which activates "phnAB" genes. These genes produce the molecule quinolone which then regulates operons 1 and 2 of "phzRABCDEFG" which are key to the synthesis of phenazine. 
The synthesis of pyocyanin is primarily controlled by the quorum sensing process. "P.aeruginosa" strains which are unable to synthesise PCN can still benefit from its effects if the strain has co- infected the lung with wild type strains which can produce pyocyanin. Biosynthesis can be impaired by disrupting the "aro" pathway which is responsible for the synthesis of chorismic acid from shikimate. Chorismic acid is the precursor of pyocyanin.
The complete virulence of "P. aeruginosa" can only be experienced when pyocyanin is produced.
Redox warfare.
Pyocyanin inactivates catalase by reducing its gene’s transcription as well as directly targeting the enzyme itself. Glutathione, an important antioxidant is modulated by pyocyanin. In particular the pool of the reduced form is depleted while the oxidised form is promoted by hydrogen peroxide which is not dismutated by catalase. 
In the cystic fibrosis lung, intracellular pyocyanin converts molecular oxygen to the superoxide free radical by reducing NADPH to NADP+. This has a doubly negative effect on the lungs. Firstly, the NADPH used by pyocyanin depletes the available substrate for the reaction catalysed by the NADPH oxidase enzyme. Secondly, the superoxide radical generated can inhibit cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13 and IFN-γ which usually upregulate NADPH oxidase. When the lung is confronted with pyocyanin, an increased concentration of catalase and superoxide dismutase is seen in order to deal with the barrage of radicals being produced.
Targets.
Pyocyanin is able to target a wide range of cellular components and pathways. Pathways which are affected by pyocyanin include the electron transport chain, vesicular transport, and cell growth. An enhanced susceptibility to pyocyanin is seen in cells which have mutation in certain proteins or complexes. Mutations in genes affecting V-ATPase synthesis and assembly, vesicle transport machinery, protein sorting machinery all confer an increased sensitivity to pyocyanin which further enhances the effects on cystic fibrosis on the patient. Vacuolar- ATPase in yeast cells is a particularly potent target as it is the main non-mitochondrial producer of ATP but also has numerous other functions such as calcium homeostatic control, the facilitation of receptor-mediated endocytosis and the degradation of proteins. Therefore the inactivation of vacuolar-ATPase by hydrogen peroxide produced by pyocyanin has huge consequences for the lung. Additional to these effects, another target of pyocyanin is caspase 3-like proteases which can then go on to initiate apoptosis and necrosis. Mitochondrial electron carrier’s ubiquinone and nicotinic acid are also susceptible to pyocyanin. The cell cycle can be disturbed by the action of pyocyanin as well as hinder the proliferation of lymphocytes. This is done by the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide which cause oxidative stress by damaging DNA directly or alternatively targeting other constituents of the cell cycle such as DNA recombination and repair machinery. Pyocyanin contributes to the disproportion of protease and antiprotease activity by disabling α1- protease inhibitor.
Cystic fibrosis.
Many studies have concluded that pyocyanin has a derogatory effect in cystic fibrosis which enables "P. aeruginosa" to persist in the cystic fibrosis lung; it is often detected in the sputum from cystic fibrosis patients. Pyocyanin in vitro has the ability to interfere with functions such as ciliary beating and therefore cause epithelial dysfunction as the ciliary are needed to sweep mucus up the throat. Additionally, neutrophil apoptosis, immunoglobulin release from B-lymphocytes and interleukin release e.g. IL-8 and CCL5 are all impaired by pyocyanin causing the immune system of the lung to be weakened. In vivo studies have shown that the growth of fungus is inhibited in the presence of pyocyanin. The fungicidal mechanism is the activation of NAD(P)H to induce a redox active cascade to produce reactive oxygen intermediates. This allows "P. aeruginosa" to have a competitive advantage as it may dominate over other microorganisms in the cystic fibrosis lung. 
The intracellular concentration of ATP is also diminished by pyocyanin causing further damage to CFTR which are already impaired in cystic fibrosis. CFTR channels rely on ATP for two main purposes. Firstly, the binding and hydrolysis of ATP has to occur at two nucleotide binding domains for the channel to move between its open and closed conformation. Secondly, phosphorylation of CFTR by Protein kinase A II should occur in order for the channel to be operational. PKA II is activated by cAMP which is produced from ATP. Both these processes are impaired when ATP is depleted by pyocyanin.
Defence against pyocyanin.
"Caenorhabditis elegans" possesses two specific ABC transporters called "pgp-1" and "pgp-2" which are effectively able to extrude intracellular pyocyanin in an energy dependent manner.

<doc id="20117906" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20117906" title="American Moving &amp; Storage Association">
American Moving &amp; Storage Association

The American Moving & Storage Association (AMSA) is the non-profit trade association representing members of the professional moving industry based primarily in the United States. Its approximately 4,000 members consist of van lines, their agents, independent movers, forwarders, industry suppliers, and certain individuals and organizations (AMSA does not represent the self-storage industry). 
AMSA administers the industry’s ProMover quality certification program, aimed at consumers. It offers its members professional training and certification and provides them with federal government representation, statistical industry reporting, arbitration services for loss or damage claims, safety and compliance guidance, federal government rate filing, professional conferences, public relations, publications, and annual safety and quality awards. It publishes a bimonthly magazine, "Direction", and a quarterly data summary, "Industry Trends". 
Based in Alexandria, Virginia, AMSA is affiliated with 27 state moving associations and several international moving associations. Its Moving & Storage Institute, founded in 2001, sponsors industry research and scholarships.
History.
AMSA is the result of three predecessors merging over time: the National Moving & Storage Association (NMSA), the American Movers Conference (AMC), and the Household Goods Carriers’ Bureau (HGCB). 
The NMSA, the first national U.S. trade association for movers, was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1920 as the National Furniture Warehousemen’s Association. In 1935, the Household Goods Movers’ Group of the American Trucking Association was formed as a separate trade organization, changing its name in 1962 to the American Movers Conference. The HGCB was established in 1936 to help carriers comply with the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. In 1994, the AMC and the HGCB merged; and in 1998, the AMC and the NMSA merged to form AMSA.
Membership.
Member companies include local, national and international firms and their suppliers offering moving and associated storage services for households and businesses; crating and transportation for sensitive freight including trade show displays, electronics, scientific and medical equipment, privately owned automobiles, fine art, and equipment for college and professional sports teams; and increasingly, portable on-demand storage and records storage and management. Specialized services may include climate-controlled storage for items such as furs, wine, film, rugs, art, magnetic tape, and documents. Many AMSA members engage in supply chain warehousing. 
Members also handle national and international employee relocation and personal property moves for the private sector and U.S. government agencies such as the State Department (through the General Services Administration) as well as for active duty U.S. military personnel (Department of Defense business represents the industry's largest single customer). AMSA hosted GSA's Household Goods and Freight Forum at its annual conference from 2008 to 2012. 
Members engaged in moving must abide by an ethical code of conduct and comply with state, or for interstate moves, federal transportation safety and consumer protection regulations.
Membership is also open to industry affiliates (companies which provide specialized services or products, work collaboratively with industry businesses, use industry services, or whose own clientele is involved in or impacted by the move process); individuals (industry employees, van operators, and others whose work is impacted by the moving and storage sector); and professional and trade associations, including state, regional, national and international moving associations and related industry professional organizations.
ProMover program.
Interstate moves.
In January 2008, to help consumers avoid unscrupulous or illegitimate movers (many proliferating on the Internet), AMSA created the ProMover certification program for its members that have federal interstate operating authority. Such members must pass an annual criminal background check, be licensed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and agree to abide by ethical standards such as honesty in advertising and in business transactions with customers. Each ProMover also signs a contract to commit to adhere to applicable Surface Transportation Board and FMSCA regulations. AMSA also examines company ownership and registration with state corporation commissions, and the mover must maintain at least a satisfactory rating with the Better Business Bureau. Those that pass are authorized to display the ProMover logo on their websites and in marketing materials; those that fail are expelled from the program (and from AMSA) if they cannot correct discrepancies during a probationary period.
Intrastate moves.
In October 2010, AMSA began a two-year pilot program with the California Moving & Storage Association, the first time ProMover certification was made available to qualified movers operating only within a state. The program has since become permanent.

Pat Pieper

Frank "Pat" Pieper served as the Chicago Cubs field (public address) announcer from 1916 to 1974, a span of 59 years.
Vendor at West Side Park.
Pieper (pronounced “Piper”) was born February 17, 1886 in Hanover, Germany. His family, including ten siblings, settled in Denver, Colorado. In 1904, 17-year old Pat left for Chicago in search of a career. He was hired as a popcorn and peanut vendor by Dan Ryan, Sr., then the concessions boss at West Side Park, the home field of the Cubs. He later recalled that Ryan told him that “the first fifty years are the toughest. After that, it’s easy.”
By 1916, the Cubs had moved into Weeghman Park, soon to become known as Wrigley Field. The team did not bring along their field announcer, and Pieper talked himself into the job with Cub President Charles Weeghman.
Pieper also worked in the World Series of 1918, wherein the Cubs used Comiskey Park as home due to its greater capacity. There, he had the unusual task of announcing a pinch hitter for Babe Ruth, who was then a young pitcher for the Boston Red Sox. "The Babe," says Pieper, "was always tough for my Cubs."
The Voice of Wrigley Field.
Pieper first got to use an electronic public address system in 1932. “That saved my life,” he said. "Before that, I had to run up and down the lines with my [14-pound] megaphone to make any kind of announcement. On some of those hot Wrigley Field days I’d lose six or eight pounds.” As field announcer, he proclaimed the lineups, the current batter, defensive changes and so forth. He also introduced special guests and announced special events, such as births within the Cub "family."
On September 25, 1963, the retiring Stan Musial was named a Vice President of the St. Louis Cardinals just before he came to bat in the third inning at Wrigley. The next time that Musial batted, Pieper announced him with his new title. The Vice President struck out, then left the game for City Hall to be made an honorary citizen of Chicago.
Pieper's signature phrase at the beginning of each game was, "Attention! ... Attention, please! ... Have your pencil ... and scorecards ready ... and I'll give you... the correct lineup ... for today's ball game. The batt'ry ... for the [pitcher's name ... and name." so on He also would announce, "Play ball!" at the start of the game.
Witness to Diamond History.
As Pieper missed just 16 home games during his time with the Cubs, none after 1924, he witnessed virtually all of the great moments in Wrigley Field baseball history. His most treasured moment? “That would be in the spring of 1917 … when our big left hander, Jim (Hippo) Vaughn, and Fred Toney, a right hander for Cincinnati pitched a double no-hitter for nine innings," Pieper recalled. “Somewhere at home I still have a picture of that great afternoon – a photograph of Vaughn, Toney and me.”
“Don’t let anybody tell you the Babe didn’t point to the bleachers before he slammed that homer off Charlie Root,” said Pieper, referring to The Called Shot of 1932. “I know. I had the best seat in the house ... I remember it as if it were yesterday. Guy Bush, one of our best pitchers was on the edge of the Cub dugout screaming ‘You big so and so, he’s got two strikes on you. He’ll get you next time.’ Ruth stepped out of the batter’s box. He definitely pointed toward center field where he planted Root’s next pitch.” 
Pieper was on the job when Gabby Hartnett‘s Homer in the Gloamin' helped propel the Cubs to the 1938 National League pennant. "I have always attempted to handle my job as announcer with dignity,” recalled Pieper. “But when I saw Gabby's hit soaring on its way over the left field fence, I picked up the bag of baseballs I keep for umpires and ran to third base to meet him. Then I jogged beside him until he reached home plate. You might say I brought Gabby home. I kept shouting, 'Be sure and touch the plate.' Gabby just smiled. I never saw a man so happy. I was 52 years old then. That was no way for me to behave." 
Pieper names Rogers Hornsby as the greatest all-around player he'd seen. “He did everything well: hit, run, field. Hornsby wasn’t a flashy player, just a great who had his head jammed with baseball knowledge. He knew every hitter in the league. He played position on ‘em, and very frequently he was within six inches of where the ball was hit." Pieper regarded the Cubs infield with Billy Jurges, Billy Herman and Phil Cavarretta as more proficient than the legendary Tinker, Evers and Chance. "I pick them because the rabbit ball has made the job of the infielders much, much tougher than it was in 1906."
Personal.
The Cubs honored Pieper with a “day” on September 22, 1940, celebrating 25 years as field announcer, and again on September 13, 1953, in honor of his fifty years as a Cub employee. The latter occasion took place a day before Gene Baker and Ernie Banks joined—and thus integrated—the ballclub. In 1961, he got to throw out the first ball to open the season, after which he reported for work as customary, in his chair behind home plate, making the usual announcements and providing fresh baseballs to the plate umpire as needed. The Hall of Fame made a recording of Pieper's voice in 1966.
As Wrigley Field had no lighting system until 1988, all the Cubs home games were played in the daytime. After the games, Pieper would serve as a waiter at The Ivanhoe, a castle-themed north-side Chicago restaurant that opened in 1920 and featured turrets and drawbridges, and even had an adjoining theater.
Pieper met Karen Marie Jorgensen in 1910, and after what he called “a whirlwind courtship,” married her in 1918. Karen didn’t like to attend baseball games, although Pieper recalls that he once got her to stay for all of three innings. Karen died in 1971. They had no children..”
A dedicated bowler, Pieper subbed for an absent player in the American Bowling Congress tournament in 1924. He threw three consecutive strikes before the absentee returned. He was a mainstay of the Cubs’ team, rolling alongside Andy Pafko, Billy Holm, Phil Cavarretta and Gabby Hartnett, often in tournaments organized by Ray Schalk. Pieper bowled a 200 game at age 80.
Death.
Pieper was taken ill after reporting for work at the ballpark on September 8, 1974. Suffering from acute jaundice, he was admitted to American Hospital, and died on October 22, 1974. In 1996, he was inducted into the Chicago Cubs Walk of Fame.
